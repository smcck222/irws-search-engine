FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ciba ready to forge US alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba, the largest of the big three Swiss drugs companies, said yesterday it
would soon sign alliances in the US in response to the changing healthcare
environment there.
Mr Pierre Douaze, head of Ciba's pharmaceuticals division, said deals could
be done with other drugs companies or with organisations closer to the
patient, such as drug distributors and health management organisations.
The move would be partly in response to the Dollars 6bn acquisition last
year by Merck, the biggest US drugs company, of Medco, a drug distributor.
That deal was a response to efforts by government and employers to cut
healthcare spending by insisting on discounts and buying from groups of
companies.
Mr Douaze said Ciba was looking at several options and that a decision would
be made soon. 'We have to move before all the positions are taken,' he said.
Mr Douaze was speaking at the company's annual results presentation, which
revealed 1993 post-tax profits up 11.2 per cent to SFr1.78bn (Dollars
1.3bn), compared with figures for 1992 which were restated last summer to
conform with international accounting standards.
Sales rose to SFr22.65bn, a gain of 2 per cent in constant currency terms.
Earnings per share rose to SFr63.8 from SFr56 and the dividend is to be
lifted by SFr1 to SFr15 per share.
The company has three divisions: healthcare, industry and agriculture. Last
year saw healthcare overtake industry to become the companies biggest single
division with sales of SFr9.22bn, a rise of 5 per cent on 1992. Much of the
gain was the result of a 20 per cent sales increase at Ciba Vision thanks to
the popularity of contact lenses.
Sales at the industry division, which includes textile dyes, chemicals and
plastics, fell 1 per cent to SFr8.61bn. The decline was mostly accounted for
by a 21 per cent fall in sales of composite materials to the aerospace
industry, hit by defence cuts.
Agriculture sales rose 1 per cent to SFr4.8bn, in spite of pressure on the
business in Europe, where the Community Agricultural Policy has cut the
acreage of land under cultivation. Ciba said the European agricultural
products market was unlikely to grow for the next two to three years, but
growth would come from Asia and South America.
Last year, Ciba switched to guidelines of the International Accounting
Standards Committee (Iasc) and revised 1992 group net profit to SFr1.6bn
from SFr1.52bn.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann's Vox TV unit fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest media groups, suffered a serious
setback yesterday when the Vox private television channel collapsed.
'Our intensive efforts to save the channel have not so far produced an
acceptable result,' the company said.
The group said on Monday that it was in last-minute negotiations with Walt
Disney in the hope that the US group would take a 49 per cent stake.
Bertelsmann held a 24.9 per cent stake as the only remaining shareholder
needed to find investors. A purchase of 49 per cent by the US group would
have left 26.1 per cent held on trust.
Walt Disney refused to confirm that it had been in talks with Bertelsmann
and would not comment on why the talks had failed.
Liquidation proceedings will start on April 1, but Vox said the channel
would continue in roughly the same format. An estimated 300 employees will
be made redundant under a plan agreed with the workers' council.
Bertelsmann suggested that new shareholders might be found once liquidation
proceedings and the cost of buying a stake had dropped sharply.
The channel's collapse is blamed on strategic miscalculations at
Bertelsmann, which masterminded the channel's launch in January 1993 and is
regarded as one of the world's most successful media groups.

BMW car and motorcycle sales increased 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of
this year, and orders are clearly higher than 12 months ago, Mr Volker
Doppelfeld, finance director, said yesterday.
However, the company only hoped these improvements would translate into
better profits, he added. The 1993 annual report, published yesterday,
predicted a satisfactory result.
Rover, the new UK subsidiary, was likely to produce improved pre-tax
earnings, although taxes and BMW's conservative accounting methods would
turn this into a loss if the group decided to consolidate the results this
year, Mr Doppelfeld added.
According to Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman, Rover's prospects were even
more interesting than believed at the time of the recent Pounds 800m
(Dollars 1.2bn) takeover. He refused to elaborate, but maintained that the
fact that Rover would remain an independent business spoke for itself.
Mr Pischetsrieder appeared optimistic on the outcome of negotiations to
maintain technological links between Rover and Honda. Expectations were high
on both sides, he said.
Confirming that technical co-operation deals on Rover's mid-range models
were to be continued into the next model generation, he said he wanted to
forge a long-term relationship with Honda.
Group turnover rose to DM7.5bn (Dollars 4.4bn) in the first quarter,
although car deliveries to customers were unchanged at 137,000 units.
Production fell 7 per cent mainly because of disruption caused by tooling up
for two new models.
The company, which plans a rights issue to raise about DM800m, is expected
to continue to outperform its domestic rivals.

increases dividend

Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest commercial bank, yesterday said it would
raise its dividend DM1.50 to DM16.50 following a 24 per cent rise in 1993
net profits to DM1.403bn (Dollars 816m).
Comprehensive annual results will be announced on Thursday, the bank said,
adding that yesterday's figures were released after the bank's supervisory
board approved the 1993 results.
The results at Deutsche are in line with expectations that German banks
would report sharply improved figures, contrasting with worse results
throughout German industry.
Net profit was up from DM1.134bn, bolstered by record results from the
bank's Luxembourg operations where pre-tax profits jumped 44.4 per cent to
DM636m from DM440m.
Deutsche, the largest operator in Luxembourg, increased its number of
customers by 28 per cent last year, helped by fears about the effect of a 30
per cent withholding tax introduced in Germany early last year.
A 194 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Morgan Grenfell, the wholly-owned
UK-based investment bank, earned Deutsche Bank a Pounds 100m (Dollars
150.3m) dividend.
The dividend increase will cost the bank DM778m and the outstanding DM625m
will be credited to reserves, the bank said.
Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, one of two big Bavarian regional
banks, is the only one of the big five German commercial banks to have
reported so far, announcing a 33 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to
DM1.04bn.
Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, just behind Deutsche on the commercial banks
league, will report in April.
Frankfurter Hypothekenbank yesterday raised its dividend DM1.5 to DM16 after
reporting net profits up 4 per cent to DM85.5m, followed by Berliner
Handels- und Frankfurter Bank which also increased its annual dividend DM1.5
to DM14.50.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: KLM raises Fl 1.19bn with global
public offer
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has raised Fl 1.19bn (Dollars 625m) through a
global public offering of ordinary shares which closed heavily
oversubscribed yesterday.
The total, which includes the sale of slightly more than Fl 225m in
preference shares to the Dutch state, was nearly Fl 200m higher than KLM
expected to raise.
The carrier said the success of the offering made KLM one of the world's
most strongly capitalised airlines. The proceeds will be used to improve the
balance sheet, opening up opportunities for KLM to finance capital spending
from internal resources.
KLM had planned to issue at least 18.5m shares at Fl 44 each, but the strong
demand prompted the banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro and Merrill Lynch, to
exercise its option to sell an additional 2.8m shares.
The Dutch state will maintain its long-standing 38.2 per cent voting stake
in KLM by purchasing 970,455 new ordinary shares, investing Fl 235m in new
convertible preference shares and topping up its payments on shares that
were previously partly-paid by Fl 22m.
The airline said this flexibility by its biggest shareholder, which had said
it wanted to spend no more than Fl 300m, enabled it to generate maximum
proceeds. Of the state's total investment, only Fl 43m would take the form
of new ordinary shares, increasing availability to other investors.
KLM said demand from the US had been reasonably strong, while there was
heavy demand from Anglo-Saxon countries. Most demand came from institutional
investors.
KLM's US partner, Northwest Airlines, recently cut the price for its initial
public offering in New York. But Mr Pieter Bouw, KLM's president, noted that
conditions governing an IPO were different from those associated with a
capital-raising exercise by a company like KLM, which has long been listed.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Swiss group moves from night to
day - Ciba has joined the international accounting club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland is fast coming in from the cold in corporate reporting, with
multinationals increasingly abandoning isolation in favour of compliance
with international accounting standards.
The latest to join the trend was Ciba, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals
group, which yesterday published its 1993 accounts, for the first time using
the guidelines of the London-based International Accounting Standards
Committee (Iasc).
Ciba's followers had a taste of what was to come last summer, when it
re-stated its 1992 results according to international accounting standards.
The effect was to increase post-tax profits by 18 per cent, while raising
inventories and cash and marketable securities.
This year, the company reports in full under the new system for the first
time. One short-term frustration for shareholders is that the company has
published no comparison with previous years, since 1993 is the first full
set of figures using the new standards.
The contrast is stark. 'It's like night and day,' says Mr Rolf Meyer, chief
financial officer. 'For the international user the old system was very
unusual and difficult to understand. It was more of a statistical summary
than an integrated accounting system.'
A report late last year by the Swiss Association of Financial Analysts and
Asset Managers suggested that the majority of leading industrial and
commercial companies have now brought their accounting into line with
international standards.
It highlighted more than 15, including Oerlikon-Buhrle, Sandoz, Roche and
Nestle. 'Shareholder information in the leading group is often better than
that of comparable countries in Europe,' it concluded.
This pattern has made Swiss companies among those with highest apparent
compliance with international standards. However, Mr David Cairns, Iasc's
secretary general, stresses that many companies elsewhere use standards
which are compatible with international standards, including those in the
UK, the US and Canada.
'Switzerland doesn't have a history of very detailed accounting rules,' says
Mr Cairns. 'Fifteen years ago Swiss companies had some of the worst in the
world. International companies had to lift themselves substantially above
existing levels.'
He says that in the last few years the Swiss have introduced new legislation
and are developing more rigorous accounting standards. However, these
changes were not enough to persuade Ciba and its competitors to stick simply
to national standards.
Mr Meyer says the primary reason for moving towards international standards
was to reflect a desire to broaden the company's shareholder base in line
with its international operations. Foreign equity is now about one-third of
the total.
He adds that it 'enhances the potential for a listing' in other equity
markets, although he says there are no current plans to seek quotes outside
Switzerland.
It was not an easy process, although the transition has all been achieved
since mid-1990. 'I thought this is somewhat risky and if something slips I
will have to look for another job,' says Mr Meyer.
The company decided not simply to focus on external financial reporting by
international standards, but also to use the same system internally. Its
accounting systems have had to be overhauled as a result, to report in a way
that corresponds closely to the figures shown in the accounts.
It set up a small international team with considerable power to introduce
accounting changes.
'We didn't have any technology freaks,' he says. 'We wanted to use proven
tools that provided results quickly, reliably and in a user-friendly way.'
There were teething problems, including a figure thrown up by the system on
the insurance values of fixed assets that was wrong by SFr1bn (Dollars
690m). However, a series of trial runs appears to have smoothed out the
difficulties.
Mr Meyer says there have been large savings as a result of the change,
including tighter cash management, more efficient capital investment, a
different approach to acquisitions, and more rigid asset management which he
estimates has reduced the value of inventories by 6 per cent.
He says one principal advantage has been to allow the company to benchmark
its performance for the first time against its competitors. 'It has helped
our internal management become tighter and more transparent.'
One of the largest differences has been to move from the arguably more
informative current cost accounting approach that Ciba had used over 25
years - which regularly updates asset values - to historical cost accounting
under international standards.
'From a management accounting view we are still convinced we had a very good
system, but we were calling out from the desert,' he says. 'We were by
ourselves and eventually we had to listen to our customers.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest charges fuel Adwest's 21%
rise to Pounds 3.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adwest, the automotive components and power systems group, yesterday
announced a 21 per cent jump in interim pre-tax profits fuelled by sharply
lower interest charges and a 20 per cent improvement in property.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 rose from Pounds 3.24m to
Pounds 3.93m, on flat sales of Pounds 63m. At the operating level profits
fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 4.04m.
Mr Fred Grant, who was making his last presentation as chairman and chief
executive before retiring in April, said he was confident Adwest would
progress this year.
'We take a fairly confident view of the future,' he said. For this reason
the interm dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 2.1p. Earnings rose by 9
per cent to 3.8p. Mr Grant said the group intended to hold dividend cover at
about this level.
The proceeds of the Pounds 22m rights issue in September, lower interest
rates and cash generation helped to cut debt charges from Pounds 1.28m to
Pounds 531,000. The property division increased its contribution from Pounds
1.33m to Pounds 1.59m.
Mr Graham Menzies, the chief executive-elect, said profits from the
manufacturing divisions had held up well when compared with last year's
exceptionally strong first half.
Profits had been hit by redundancy costs of Pounds 150,000 and bad debts of
about Pounds 100,000. Adwest had also suffered abortive acquisition costs
which had depressed profits.
The automotive division suffered from the French recession, with operating
profits 11 per cent lower at Pounds 1.44m, on sales 5 per cent down at
Pounds 36.87m. France continued to be difficult, although there were
tentative signs of an improvement.
Mr Menzies said recent increases in volumes from most of Adwest's main
customers had left order books about 12 per cent ahead in the automotive
division.
Power systems, which relies on defence related orders for about 48 per cent
of its business, had been increasingly competitive and margins had suffered.
Operating profits fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 1m, on sales 8 per cent
ahead to Pounds 24.54m. Mr Menzies said that while orders were still lower
than last year, there was some evidence that the decline had halted.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Counting the true cost of aircraft leasing
deals - Robert Peston examines the methods employed by British Aerospace to
sustain its aviation business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buried deep in British Aerospace's accounts, published yesterday, is a note
which could be as significant to the future prosperity of the UK's leading
defence and aviation business as the Pounds 800m it has raised recently from
the sale of its Rover car-making subsidiary to BMW.
BAe has disclosed for the first time that it has obligations under leasing
arrangements totalling Pounds 2.9bn, compared with income that it expects to
receive on sub-leases of Pounds 1.8bn - and only an undisclosed part of that
sub-lease income is contractually committed.
What this shows is the substantial financial risks which it has been taking
over the past two decades in order to sustain its civil aircraft
manufacturing operations. In large part because of this leasing exposure,
the company came perilously near to collapse over the past two years.
As Mr Richard Lapthorne, its finance director, said: 'We got very close.
Writing off a billion (as the company did in 1992, with a third of the
losses stemming from aircraft leases) and not recognising the need for
change would have bankrupted the company.'
In the past three years, its commercial aircraft division has lost Pounds
1.79bn in aggregate, including exceptional reorganisation costs and
provisions against losses on the leases, but excluding tax and interest
payments.
Those losses are many times greater than the modest aggregated profits made
by the division in the boom years of the 1980s. Provisions made in the past
two years to cover aircraft lease losses total some Pounds 600m.
The company had implemented a text book recovery process, said Mr Lapthorne.
The balance sheet was strengthened by the Rover disposal proceeds and last
year's sweeping reorganisation of banking arrangements.
This has given BAe the confidence to change its accounting procedures to
give a more accurate picture of the leasing risks. The new balance sheet
presentation shows that the main buyers of BAe's commercial aircraft have
not been airlines, despite what common sense would suggest, but have in fact
been banks and other financial institutions.
These banks purchased the aeroplanes and leased them back to British
Aerospace under agreements lasting between 15 and 20 years, depending on the
type of aircraft. BAe then rented them on sub-leases of between three and
five years to airlines. It has therefore been exposed to the risk of
substantial losses if these short-term leases were not renewed.
According to Mr Lapthorne, the appropriate analogy for BAe's civil aircraft
business is not a normal manufacturing operation but, rather, property
development: 'You don't sell airplanes . . . to airlines,' he said. 'You
build an airplane speculatively and then sell it to the bank. You then find
an airline as a tenant.'
Mr Lapthorne said that all aircraft manufacturers engaged in this kind of
financial engineering. In the early 1980s, when air travel was a boom
industry and there was widespread inflation, each time a sub-lease expired
it was replaced with another at higher rates.
However, just like property developers, when recession hit the airline
industry after the 1991 Gulf War, the aircraft lessors were hit by huge
losses as some airlines ran into serious difficulties and were unable to
make lease payments.
The most prominent victim was GPA, the specialist leasing business, which
had to be refinanced last year. However, it has emerged from BAe's accounts
that its leasing exposure is enough to engender vertigo in the most
phlegmatic finance director.
Mr Lapthorne said that containing the risks figured among his top priorities
within days of joining the company in July 1992.
BAe has sold more than 200 series 146 regional jets since launch just over a
decade ago. Of these, it is exposed to lease payments on half. In respect of
350 turboprop aircraft sales it has continuing financial exposure to 75 per
cent.
It is committed to make payments to banks and other financial institutions
of Pounds 1.8bn in respect of head leases it has signed. More than Pounds
1bn of these payments are contracted to be made in more than five years,
after most of the sub-leases have expired.
There is a second category of exposure for BAe. Even when it sold aircraft
directly to airlines rather than banks, it often provided guarantees on
leases which the airlines themselves took out with financial institutions.
Thus BAe has 'third party head lease and other recourse costs' of Pounds
1bn. In total therefore, its has gross head lease obligations of Pounds
2.85bn, or about three times the value of its shareholders' funds.
Mr Lapthorne said that its total lease obligations are greater still, taking
account of its share of its exposure to the head lease obligations of its
associated company, Airbus Industrie.
Some of its lease obligations are covered by income on sub-leases to
airlines. It said that it expects sub-lease income to total Pounds 1.76bn.
However, Mr Lapthorne said that this income is not all contractually
committed. It is a combination of both committed and expected lease income,
estimated on the basis of precedent.
'It's calculated like an insurance company calculates risk,' he said. 'It's
a judgment, but our model and all the thinking behind it has been thoroughly
audited.'
Nonetheless, there is a shortfall of Pounds 1bn between this estimate of
what it expects to receive and what it has to pay out on head leases,
although some of the gap is covered by its Pounds 230m estimate of the
disposal value of aircraft after they revert to it.
BAe thus calculates its net risk of uncovered payments on head leases at
Pounds 866m. Those payments will be made over many years, and BAe estimates
that their present value - taking account of inflation - is Pounds 653m in
today's money. It has therefore made provisions to cover losses of this
magnitude, including an addition of Pounds 250m in respect of the turboprop
aircraft made in the 1993 results.
Its financial performance should only suffer further damage from the lease
exposure if its estimates of sub-lease renewals and of the residual sale
value of aircraft are too optimistic. However, Mr Lapthorne is confident
that BAe is now accounting for its leasing exposure more prudently than any
aircraft company in the world.
He also says that disclosing the implicit leasing costs of selling aircraft,
which was done within the company last year, has already had an important
effect on corporate culture: 'In 1993, for the first time in the company's
history, BAe turned down aircraft sales.' If precedent is any guide,
shareholders must hope that the company fails to make a few more sales.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Littlewoods climbs by 74%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Littlewoods, the retailing and football pools group that is one of the UK's
largest private companies, announced a 74 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits yesterday, and insisted that it would remain private.
Profits before tax for the year to December 31 increased to Pounds 117.2m.
The Pounds 67.3m for 1992 has been restated in accordance with FRS 3 to take
into account exceptional costs of Pounds 29.7m for the group's withdrawal
from the food hall business - which was taken over by Iceland - and from its
retail finance businesses.
There were net exceptional costs of Pounds 3.4m for 1993, with Pounds 10.9m
rationalisation costs offset by a Pounds 7.5m profit on the sale of
Littlewoods' Christmas hampers business.
Excluding exceptionals, underlying profits grew by 24 per cent from Pounds
97m to Pounds 120.6m.
The death of Sir John Moores, the group's founder, last September had led to
speculation that the group might be floated, with rumours that some of the
32 shareholder members of the Moores family were keen to sell their stakes.
However, Mr Leonard van Geest, chairman, insisted there were no plans for
flotation.
'We have no need to go public,' he said. 'The family members are all very
committed to the business, and maintain a strong interest in it.'
He added that not having access to equity finance was not a problem as the
group was able to borrow at good rates.
Littlewoods moved from net borrowings of Pounds 6.1m at the beginning of
1993 to net cash of Pounds 58.9m at the year-end.
Sales increased by 2.5 per cent from Pounds 2.71bn to Pounds 2.78bn, of
which the retail businesses contributed Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.9bn).
Sales in Littlewoods chain stores declined from Pounds 696m to Pounds 666m,
mainly as a result of disruption during the conversion of food halls to the
Iceland format.
Operating profits from the continuing business increased from Pounds 33.2m
to Pounds 37.8m.
In the home shopping division, sales rose from Pounds 978m to Pounds 1.04bn,
and profits from Pounds 56.3m to Pounds 68.6m.
The Index catalogue shops increased sales to Pounds 251m (Pounds 228m).
Losses were reduced to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 9.1m). Profits from the group's
football pools side grew to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.6m).
Mr Barry Dale, chief executive, said trading was buoyant over Christmas, but
had slackened in recent weeks. Looming tax increases next month had damaged
consumer confidence, he said.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Monarch Resources plans to raise Dollars
30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fed up with London investors' lack of interest in smaller mining companies
and the fall in research coverage of the sector, Monarch Resources is to
raise Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m), principally from Canadian investors, so
that it can apply to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Monarch's shares reacted favourably to this news yesterday and rose from
251p to 262p.
The company, which has gold mining and exploration operations in Venezuela,
intends to keep its London Stock Exchange quotation 'for the foreseeable
future'.
Present shareholders, of which about 70 per cent of the 550 holders are
based in the UK, will be able to take part in the cash-raising exercise via
an open offer for up to Pounds 7m.
Monarch also reported substantially reduced losses before tax, down from
Dollars 4.72m to Dollars 2.81m for the year to the end of December. There
was an attributable loss of Dollars 2.8m for losses of 10 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 4.72m or 32 cents. Turnover was Dollars 7.37m, against
Dollars 6.97m.
Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said he wanted Monarch listed on the Toronto
exchange partly because price-earnings multiples for smaller gold mining
companies were on average twice those in London, but also because London was
becoming more restrictive. 'Companies like ours need more flexibility,' he
said.
Monarch's biggest shareholder, Mr August von Finck, a German businessman,
will take up the shareholder offer and suffer a 'modest' dilution from his
present 22.9 per cent.
Most of the new funds raised will be used to finance Monarch's exploration
programmes this year and in 1995. These will be stepped up substantially,
mainly at the Venezuelan concessions but also in other parts of central and
south America.
Mr Beckett said the Revemin processing plant was now generating cash - there
was a net Dollars 190,000 gain last year compared with a net cash loss of
Dollars 1.08m - and the La Comorra mine was scheduled to start operating in
June.
The offer to North American investors will be at or near the prevailing
price after a preliminary prospectus is issued on about May 10. ScotiaMcLeod
is leading a syndicate of underwriters to the offer.

64m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Grenfell has raised Pounds 64.2m with the launch of its Latin
American Companies investment trust, Pounds 53m of which came from an
institutional placing.
A similar fund, the Inca trust from Edinburgh Fund Managers, raised about
Pounds 30m during its placing. The result of its public offer is not yet
known.
Both trusts had initially set higher targets, but Morgan Grenfell said that
given market conditions during the offer period, it was very satisfied with
the amount raised. The placing for a third Latin American fund, from
Templeton, is still under way.
Dealings in the Morgan trust's shares and warrants are due to start
tomorrow.

The changing climate of health care in the UK helped Nestor-BNA, the nursing
agency, personnel and medical services group, to achieve pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4.52m for 1993.
The Pounds 1.71m figure for 1992 has been restated in accordance with FRS 3

coming from health care, 67 per cent in the UK and 21 per cent in the US.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ulster TV plans move into cable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ulster Television is planning to apply for a licence to cable Belfast and
its surrounding area 10 years after the ITV company first became interested
in cable television.
Then UTV was in a consortium that included British Telecom and STC but
nothing came of the venture.
Mr Desmond Smyth, chief executive, said yesterday he believed the time was
now right for cable and the company was in preliminary talks with Mercury
Communications.
The Independent Television Commission is expected to advertise a local
delivery licence (cable) for Belfast later this year.
Mr Smyth said he was convinced that investing in a cable and telephony
consortium was a far better investment than taking over another small ITV
company.
He was speaking as the company announced a record pre-tax profit of Pounds
5.07m for 1993, its first year of the new ITV licences. The figure compared
with Pounds 4.18m last time.
Mr John McGuckian, chairman, described the result as outstanding although
the figure was made up of operating profit of Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 2.85m)
and investment income of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.33m).
Direct comparison is difficult, however, because of the changes, including
the cash bid of Pounds 1.03m a year for the licence and a new basis payment
for network programmes.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 28.8m).
Earnings per share were 31.78p (24.2p) and a higher proposed final dividend
of 8.75p (5.75p) making an increased total for the year up from 10p to 15p.
Mr McGuckian said that in the first quarter of this year the share of ITV
advertising has continued to rise although it was too early to say whether
this would be sustained throughout the year.
The shares rose 6p on the day to close at 667p.

Shares in Coal Investments, formerly Geevor, rose 8p to 84p on their return

The shares have been one of the market's most outstanding performers since
Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, took over as
chairman last September. They were relisted last October at 10p. Last
month's suspension was to allow the company to undertake a programme to
raise Pounds 11.5m, partly through a rights issue.

Estates &amp; General, property developer and investor, cut its pre-tax loss for
the year to December 31 from Pounds 26.4m to Pounds 4.51m. The figure was
struck after provisions of Pounds 2.21m against UK trading properties and a
development in Majorca, and compares with provisions of Pounds 13.3m last
time.
Group turnover was Pounds 9.45m (Pounds 9.19m) and overheads were cut by 33
per cent to Pounds 1.68m.
The company's banking facilities have been extended until the end of June
1995.
'This has been a year in which we have made encouraging progress towards
restoring the financial stability of the company,' said Mr Peter Prowting,
chairman. He is hoping to achieve 'a balance between rental income and
funding costs' in 1995, helped by new lettings and interest rate changes.
Losses per ordinary share were reduced to 21.1p against 126.7p.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Brake Bros to Pounds
19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions and an insurance claim fuelled a sharp jump in pre-tax profits
at Brake Bros, the frozen food distributor which yesterday announced a 19
per cent increase to Pounds 19.1m in 1993.
Mr Frank Brake, managing director, was cautious in spite of the profits
increase. 'We do not foresee any dramatic change in the marketplace and are
expecting it to remain flat this year - although we are hoping for better.'
The main growth would come from acquisitions, including Country Choice Foods
purchased in May for a shares consideration of Pounds 10m.
Sales were 26 per cent higher at Pounds 354m, helped by the inclusion for
seven months of CCF. Continuing businesses were 10 per cent higher at Pounds
311m.
At the operating level, profits of continuing businesses improved by 3 per
cent to Pounds 18m.
Acquisitions contributed a further Pounds 2.28m to operating profits.
The operating advance was held back by higher than expected losses of Pounds
2.3m (Pounds 1m) in the chilled foods business, and a nil contribution from
France.
Operating profits also included a Pounds 1.8m insurance payment arising from
the fire at a cold store in 1991.
The core frozen foods division had increased market share, Mr Brake said,
with a 9 per cent increase in like-for-like sales.
However, margins had slipped back from 6.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Mr
Brake said the group expected margins to stabilise in the current year.
The managing director said the chilled foods business would continue to make
losses this year, although at a substantially lower rate. France was not
expected to make a substantial contribution in 1994.
The final dividend was increased by 11 per cent to 4.82p for a total of
6.82p (6.2p). Earnings per share were 9 per cent higher at 27p.
COMMENT
Brake Bros has done well to increase sales in a tough market, but the
margins are showing the effects for the third successive year. While growth
in the core frozen foods division appears to have slowed marginally in the
second half, further progress is expected from Country Choice. Longer-term,
France and chilled foods offer potential, assuming nothing goes wrong. Few
expect Brake to race ahead in 1994 with the real growth pegged for 1995-96.
Forecasts are for Pounds 21m this year. This puts the shares, which closed
yesterday at 476p, on a multiple of about 17 times. While this may look
high, the premium is lower than it has been for some time.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Macfarlane shows 25% improvement to Pounds
12.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Glasgow-based packaging company, boosted
annual profits by 25 per cent on the back of an 11 per cent rise in
turnover.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December rose from Pounds 10.2m to
Pounds 12.7m on turnover of Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 87m).
Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said that all divisions of the
company had benefited from a gentle upturn in the UK economy. The group had
increased the numbers employed from 1,500 to 1,600.
Packaging accounts for 70 per cent of turnover and 75 per cent of the
workforce. The group runs two other divisions - plastic moulding and
development, which includes the group's sticky label and furniture business.
A&amp;W Fullarton, the largest manufacturing company in the packaging division,
is investing in additional storage facilities in order to cope with
increased demand.
In plastic mouldings, ACW of Aberdeen increased its capacity and started to
produce a new range of packaging for the medical sector.
Earnings per share emerged at 11.25p (8.8p), and a final dividend 2.4p takes
the total for the year to 3.84p (3.186p). In the past four years the
dividend has risen by some 57 per cent.
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 19m, up from Pounds 11m.
Lord Macfarlane said further small acquisitions were expected this year,
which together with planned organic growth would use up much of the cash.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Proudfoot runs up deficit of Pounds 11m and
seeks Pounds 9.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proudfoot, the management consultancy chaired by Lord Stevens and which has
been extensively restructured, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds
10.9m for 1993 and a rights issue to raise Pounds 9.6m.
The pre-tax deficit compares with a previous profit of Pounds 24.5m. It was
struck after taking an exceptional charge of Pounds 20.2m on the closure
last April of its operations in Sweden and Norway. The charge is made up of
Pounds 2.6m of provisions, Pounds 15.7m of goodwill written off and trading
losses of Pounds 1.9m.
Profit from continuing operations after interest and before tax was Pounds
9.3m, down from a previous Pounds 30.8m. This was struck on turnover from
continuing operations of Pounds 140.7m, 11 per cent down from Pounds 158.6m.
Mr John Prosser, chief executive, said yesterday that the restructuring over
the past 12 months had reduced the staff from 1,400 to less than 900. The
group was now better focused on its core markets, and had been structured to
fit in with the revenue levels achieved in the last half of the year.
Operating profits for the second half were Pounds 9.5m, compared with Pounds
6.3m in the first half, and margins improved from 8 per cent in the first
half to 15 per cent in the second.
The rights issue would complete the restructuring and strengthen the capital
base, Mr Prosser said. The balance sheet shows negative shareholders' funds
of Pounds 23.9m.
As at February 28 the group had net cash of Pounds 5.4m, compared with
Pounds 14.3m at the end of the year.
The rights issue, underwritten by Samuel Montagu, is on a 2-for-7 basis at
60p. Yesterday the shares closed 3p higher at 71p.
Losses per share emerged at 25p (earnings 17.5p). A final dividend of 1.5p
is proposed, making a total for the year of 3.5p (12p), in line with the
company policy of paying out 40 per cent of earnings per share from
continuing operations.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Misys cash call for software acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Misys, the computer services and application software group, yesterday
announced plans to acquire Kapiti, a leading packaged banking software
supplier, through a recommended cash and shares offer which values the
unquoted group at Pounds 40m.
The Pounds 25m cash element of the proposed acquisition is to be funded by
way of a 2-for-13 rights issue at 425p a share which is fully underwritten
by Baring Brothers. Misys shares closed up 2p at 513p yesterday.
Kapiti, which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1m) on sales
of Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 24.9m) last year, claims to be the second largest
banking software supplier in the world and has a well established customer
base.
The group, which has developed following the merger of Kapiti and Aregon in
December 1989, has a strong and growing overseas business and a product
development strategy which embraces the increasingly popular client/server
computer network design.
Its products, which include Equation and Equinox banking software, are
installed in more than 600 locations in 70 countries including a growing
number of emerging markets. The market for licensed banking software
products is currently estimated to be worth about Pounds 200m a year.
Kapiti's products should complement Misys' existing portfolio of software
products which are aimed mainly at specialist vertical markets including the
insurance broking, construction, hotels and higher education.
In particular, the acquisition, which is subject to shareholder approval at
an extraordinary meeting on April 14, will broaden Misys' geographic base.
At present only 3 per cent of Misys' Pounds 100m turnover is generated
overseas. About 25 per cent of the combined group's sales will come from
overseas.
Mr Kevin Lomax, Misys chairman, said: 'The Kapiti acquisition represents an
excellent opportunity for Misys to expand its business in terms of product
mix, customer base and the geographic markets it serves.'
Misys has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from holders
of more than 90 per cent of Kapiti's share capital.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rotork at Pounds 13m on back of new product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good sales of a new design of valve control helped Rotork lift 1993 pre-tax
profits from Pounds 10.5m to a record Pounds 12.9m.
The 23 per cent improvement was achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 57.1m
to Pounds 70.7m.
Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said the company had been encouraged by the
speed with which the new IQ valve actuator had been accepted by customers
around the world in a conservative market place.
Rotork's main business is designing, assembling and selling electric
mechanisms to open and close valves. The IQ control is operated through an
infrared system, so it can remain sealed in hostile climates.
Customers included every valve manufacturer in the world, Mr Eassie said.
New orders last year included controls for a large oil metering system in
central Siberia, and for one of the biggest water treatment plants in China.
During the year Rotork spent Pounds 3.3m on strategic acquisitions, buying
its Venezuelan agent and raising its stake in its Indian agent. It also
acquired the 75 per cent it did not own of Exeeco, which makes gearboxes for
electric valve controls. The acquisitions accounted for Pounds 2.98m of
total turnover.
The instruments division, with turnover of Pounds 6m, benefited from an
increase in orders for emergency shut-down systems. The analysis division
made an operating loss on sales of Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m.
Net cash at the year end was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 14.5m).
Earnings per share rose from 7.56p to 9.38p. A final dividend of 2.5p is
proposed, taking the total for the year to 4.25p (3.72p).

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures Hamble to join market with
Pounds 90m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerostructures Hamble Hold-ings, the former British Aerospace aircraft
components subsidiary, yesterday announced plans for a stock market
flotation valuing the company at up to Pounds 90m.
NM Rothschild, which is advising the Hampshire-based group, said funds
raised by the float would be used to finance future capital expenditure and
repay borrowings incurred in its Pounds 47.6m management buy-out from BAe.
Although the company has secured some lucrative orders since the 1992
buy-out, its ability to win further large contracts is understood to require
a substantial capital injection.
Mr Andy Barr, chief executive, said resources had been drained by recent
work on components for the Boeing 737-700, the US aircraft maker's new
short-haul model. 'It has soaked up a fair bit of capital. The flotation
would help us with other orders which we are confident of winning,' he said.
Despite those prospects, the company still depends heavily on BAe, for which
it manufactures Hawk and Harrier fuselages as well as components for the
Avro 146. That dependence, however, declined from 92 per cent of turnover in
1992 to less than 80 per cent last year.
Mr Barr, a former Rover Group managing director, said new customers -
including Vought and Northrop - had been attracted by improved efficiency.
Operating margins, meanwhile, have increased following the introduction of
Japanese-style manufacturing practices by managers recruited mainly from
Rover.
Those practices paid off last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m,
compared with Pounds 1.7m in the eight months following the April 1992
buy-out.
The improved profits were achieved on lower turnover of Pounds 70.44m
against a pro-forma 1992 total of Pounds 71.3m.
Lord King, Aerostructures' chairman, admitted trading was difficult, but
said profits had risen year on year, and 'the group was determined to
deliver further improvements'.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Provisions leave Bardon with a deficit of
Pounds 47.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bardon Group, the UK and US aggregates group, incurred a 1993 pre-tax loss
of Pounds 47.9m after writing down the value of its marine dredging business
by Pounds 60m.
It is the second time in two years that the group has made large losses
following substantial write-downs. In 1992 Bardon ran up a pre-tax deficit
of Pounds 40.3m after provisions of Pounds 58.5m.
The latest write-down was made against Civil and Marine, which sells marine
dredged aggregates in the UK and continental Europe and which Bardon was
attempting to sell to reduce further its large borrowings.
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said yesterday that negotiations had been
terminated, adding that it was not in shareholders' interests to sell the
business while continental European construction markets - accounting for 40
per cent of sales - were in recession.
Mr Tom was more optimistic about UK and US markets where volume sales and
prices of aggregates had improved recently. As a result, he said: '1994
promises to be an appreciably better year.'
Group turnover for 1993 increased from Pounds 336m to Pounds 351m. However,
following disposals of profitable businesses and reflecting continued
pressure on margins, operating profits before exceptional provisions fell
from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 28.8m.
Losses per share worked through at 12.5p (12.4p). Adjusted for the
exceptional items, there were earnings of 1.1p (2.8p). A maintained final
dividend of 1.2p makes a same-again 2p total.
Following disposals and a Pounds 72m rights issue net debt fell from Pounds
307m to Pounds 233m, representing a reduction in gearing from 89 per cent to
66 per cent.
Operating profits in the UK, excluding discontinued operations, fell from
Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 11.5m with sales volume and prices remaining
generally flat last year while costs had increased.
On the same basis, US profits increased from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 16.5m
reflecting increased construction activity in the north eastern states.
COMMENT
Bardon would be a good business if it was not for the debts. The company is
well placed to take advantage of the construction recovery on both sides of
the Atlantic with volumes and margins likely to move further ahead this
year. The housing recovery and an upsurge in road orders in the UK since the
autumn should underpin domestic sales and earnings this year. The following
year may be more difficult with the government expected shortly to announce
large cuts in the road programme. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 22m
this year putting the company on a prospective p/e of 22. Existing
shareholders should hold but Bardon looks like it still needs a sale to get
the debt down.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hickson declines 9% to Pounds 22.1m -
Pounds 3m provided for rationalisation at main site in West Yorkshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hickson International, the speciality chemicals group, reported pre-tax
profits down by Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 22.1m in 1993 after providing Pounds
3m for rationalisation at its main site at Castleford, West Yorkshire.
The company, which has seen a series of boardroom upheavals in recent years,
also said that Sir Gordon Jones was planning to step down as non-executive
chairman.
Sir Gordon, 67, who is chairman of Yorkshire Water, was brought in three
years ago as new management tried to sort out the group after a string of
acquisitions in the late 1980s.
The restructuring at Castleford involves dropping a number of 'non-core'
product lines which are suffering from increasing competition from India and
China. The Pounds 3m provision covers the first year of a three year
programme.
Profits from the fine chemicals division, which includes Castleford and the
Irish pharmaceuticals intermediates business bought in July 1992, fell
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 12.6m after using Pounds 1m of pre-acquisition
provisions. Both operations have suffered accidents in the last 18 months
which cost a net Pounds 400,000 after insurance claims. As a result the
group's insurance premiums are expected to rise from Pounds 4.5m to more
than Pounds 6m this year.
The protection and coatings division turned in operating profits of Pounds
11.9m (Pounds 9.9m) but performance products saw profits down Pounds 1.1m to
Pounds 7.9m.
Group sales rose to Pounds 368.3m (Pounds 342.5m) with underlying growth of
just 2 per cent.
Earnings per share slipped to 10p (10.5p) but dividends are held at 8p with
a recommended final of 5.15p.
After heavy capital investment of Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 34.4m) gearing rose
to 51.3 per cent at the period end (35.5 per cent) but capital expenditure
will fall by Pounds 10m this year. Hickson has a Pounds 40m convertible
capital bond which is redeemable from the end of the year cutting the
interest charge by Pounds 2.5m. The group has sufficient facilities to
redeem the bonds out of debt.
COMMENT
The new team at Hickson has had a very difficult time over the last 18
months, with two accidents, tough trading conditions and poor performances
from recent acquisitions. Cash has continued to flow out of the business
leaving the balance sheet stretched. And the problems of the fine chemicals
division have been aggravated by increased competition from India and China.
Assuming profits of about Pounds 26m this year the shares are on a multiple
of more than 17 which looks high enough for now.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Harland and Wolff Holdings, the Belfast shipbuilding company, were
cut from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 5.65m pre-tax for the year to end-December.
Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipowner who is Harland's main shareholder and
company chairman, described the results as 'disappointing'.
The company, which was completely reorganised into self-contained business
divisions after privatisation in 1989, said the 1993 deficit included a
charge of Pounds 4.1m for foreseeable losses on contracts which were in hand
at the year end.
Harland executives said they were scouring the world for new business.

security and promotional printer, following the group's Dollars 27m year-end
acquisition of McCleery-Cumming, the second largest US publisher of
advertising calendars.
On Monday Bemrose, which has become the largest supplier to the US
advertising specialty market following a series of acquisitions, announced a
73 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.8m and a 37
per cent increase in earnings per share to 30.47p.
The McLeery-Cumming acquisition became effective on December 31 so its
results were not included in the 1993 accounts.
Mr Rodger Booth, chief exceutive, said earlier this week that it was too
early for meaningful results, but noted that Bemrose has already achieved
significant cost savings at McCleery-Cumming as a result of senior managers
retiring, a review of purchasing policy and through better capacity
utilisation.
Analysts now expect the expanded Bemrose group to report pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 15.5m this year, generating earnings per share of about 31p.
Yesterday Bemrose's shares closed 6p lower at 447p, reflecting the weak
market and theyare trading on a prospective multiple of 14.4.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Norwich Union recovers with Pounds 131m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union, one of the largest mutual insurers, yesterday reported a
return to profitability in its general insurance operations, providing
further evidence of recovery in the sector after three years of poor
results.
The group also indicated that its rates for both motor and home insurance
had fallen as claims experience in both sectors has improved.
General insurance profits for the year to end December 1993 amounted to
Pounds 131m before tax (losses of Pounds 23.4m). Gross premium income
increased to Pounds 1.72bn (Pounds 1.7bn) but net claims fell to Pounds
1.07bn (Pounds 1.2bn).
With commission and expenses falling to Pounds 375m (Pounds 405m), the
company reduced its underwriting losses to Pounds 63.4m (Pounds 167m).
Overall investment income rose to Pounds 207m (Pounds 194m).
Mr Allan Bridgewater, chief executive, said the reduction in claims had
allowed Norwich Union to reduce its premium rate for both home and motor
insurance.
Claims following thefts from cars fell by a third in 1993 to Pounds 54m. On
average, rates for comprehensive motor insurance have fallen by 12 per cent,
while rates for household contents policies have dropped by 10 per cent. Mr
Bridgewater stressed that part of the decline reflected the greater use by
policyholders of security devices and other safety and security measures.
Premium income from life business increased to Pounds 2.75bn (Pounds
2.51bn), with new regular premium income amounting to Pounds 192m (Pounds
238m). Sales of single premiums over the year were Pounds 1.19bn (Pounds
952m).
The group has also made rapid progress in the health insurance market, which
it entered in 1991. Last year premium income increased by 60 per cent to
Pounds 105m and profits were recorded in the fourth quarter. Norwich Union
now has market share of about 8 per cent and more than half a million
customers.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Waterford Wedgwood at IPounds
10m - Lack of exceptionals and growth in crystal side behind turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sparkle has returned to Waterford Wedgwood, the luxury ceramics and
crystal manufacturer, which after six years of losses has reported a IPounds
10.1m (Pounds 9.7m) pre-tax profit for 1993.
Pre-tax losses of IPounds 17m for 1992 included an exceptional charge of
IPounds 18.4m for restructuring costs and losses on property disposals.
Turnover rose by 17 per cent to IPounds 319m and operating profits improved
by 80 per cent to IPounds 16.5m. Year-end gearing dropped from 54 per cent
to 41 per cent.
The main improvement came from the crystal division where operating profits
grew from IPounds 500,000 to IPounds 7.8m, on turnover up 34 per cent to
IPounds 102m. According to Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of the division,
restructuring at its Irish plants, the introduction of 250 new products in
the past two years, better market conditions and improved marketing have all
contributed to the turnround.
'We will not be satisfied though until we are achieving margins of at least
15 per cent on sales,' he said.
Outsourced products in its middle-market Marquis range of stemware,
introduced in 1991, now accounted for 12 per cent of turnover he said.
He added that margins on products from the Irish plants continued to lag
behind outsourced products, but those were improving as a result of the
rationalisation measures and more flexible working practices.
Operating profits at the Wedgwood ceramics division edged up to IPounds
10.7m (IPounds 10.5m) on turnover up 10 per cent to IPounds 193m. Mr Kneale
Ashwell, chief executive of Wedgwood, said recession in the Japanese market
had been the main cause of tighter margins.
The company's currency hedging policy has meant that the full benefits of
the devaluations of sterling and the punt in 1992 and 1993 respectively,
will not be felt until this year.
Earnings per share were 1.27p (2.69p losses) and there is no dividend.
COMMENT
The prolonged and painful restructuring appears to have finally paid off,
with the result that management and unions are now working together and are
better attuned to what the luxury products market is demanding in the 1990s.
A carry-over of tax losses for the next three to five years and upturn in
the group's main overseas markets point to a strong recovery in earnings.
Pre-tax profits of IPounds 23m and an eps of 2.5p look achievable this year
giving a prospective 1994 p/e of 21. No basement bargains here for the
moment, but as earnings look set to outpace other Irish industrials in the
medium term, the current share price is not excessive.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson rises 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough trading conditions in the London insurance market held back profits
growth at Lloyd Thompson, the highly rated insurance broker.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 amounted to Pounds 9.6m,
an increase of 17 per cent over the corresponding period of 1992. The
interim dividend was increased by 20 per cent to 2.4p.
Brokerage income rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 20.2m. But all the increase
was due to the strength of the US dollar - Lloyd Thompson achieved an
average exchange rate of Dollars 1.57 against Dollars 1.71 last year - and
on an underlying basis brokerage volume was down by 5 per cent.
Reinsurance income fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 5.8m, compared with Pounds
6.8m last year. The decline was partially offset by increases in marine (up
by 11 per cent) and non-marine business (up 12 per cent).
Investment income increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. Expenses were
reduced by 4 per cent to Pounds 14.1m 'by means of a continuing review of
costs and the search for more efficient methods of working.'
Staff numbers were reduced by 4 per cent over the corresponding period last
year.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Threat to Heron interest meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Heron International bondholder is threatening a legal challenge to the
meetings being held tomorrow to approve a delay in interest payments. Heron,
which completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing last September, has hit problems
meeting interest payments.
Mr Gary Klesch, a dealer in distressed debt, has written to Law Debenture
Corporation, the trustee for the bonds, demanding a separate meeting for
those holders of the 7 1/2 per cent bonds which are also lenders to Heron
Corporation, a subsidiary of Heron International. He claims their interests
are different from investors who are only bondholders.
Last night Law Debenture said it would be taking advice on the question
today.
However, an expert said that Mr Klesch's demand for 'separate class
meetings' was questionable since bondholders form one, indivisible class. As
they are bearer bonds, the trustee is not entitled to know the beneficial
owners behind the bonds.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Croda advances strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Croda International fell 24p to 352p yesterday after the
speciality chemicals group reported pre-tax profits up 29 per cent to Pounds
38.5m in 1993 before a Pounds 10.4m gain on the recent sale of its inks
businesses.
Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, described it as a 'very good year' with
record profits.
Profits topped the Pounds 36.4m achieved in 1990 with earnings per share
also at a peak of 20.1p, up 31 per cent, before the exceptional. However,
the cut in the dividend in 1991 has not been fully restored. It rises by 8.4
per cent to 8.4p, with a final of 5.45p. In 1990 the pay-out was 11p.
The main chemicals business, whose products are chiefly based on natural
oils, continued to grow strongly with operating profits up 19 per cent to
Pounds 36.8m on turnover 13 per cent higher at Pounds 271m. Exports rose by
almost a fifth helped by the fall in sterling, with good sales into the
difficult personal care market in Germany.
Group turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 415m with growth of about 6 per
cent excluding exchange rate benefits and acquisitions.
Profits from coatings rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 5m, helped by the
restructuring of the UK paint business, and cosmetics and toiletries
recovered to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 500,000) having been hit by weak European
consumer demand in 1992.
The inks and graphics supplies business, which Croda sold to Manders for
Pounds 26.7m in January, made Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.1m), with the proceeds
leavings Croda with gearing of 25 per cent.
Mr Keith Hopkins, chief executive, said the current year had started well
with 'very strong' sales in Italy and France. 'There has been a certain
amount of restocking by customers but it may indicate the start of an
underlying recovery.'
COMMENT
The market reaction might appear harsh given the strength of Croda's
recovery. But the shares have had a very strong run and the company threw
current year forecasts into confusion by warning that there may not be a
repeat of last year's Pounds 2.9m pension credit in the UK. Analysts were
also concerned about the continued impact on margins of the rise in the soya
bean oil price. But these are minor issues for a company which looks
well-placed with its portfolio of natural products, reasonable exposure to
the fast-growing east Asian markets and a healthy balance sheet. On
forecasts of about Pounds 40m for the current year the shares are on a
multiple of less than 17 which looks well-deserved.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Bio seeks Pounds 93.6m to fund
drugs development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the second cash call in two days from the bustling biotechnology sector,
British Bio-technology yesterday announced a rights issue of ordinary shares
and warrants intended to raise Pounds 93.6m over the next two years.
The rights issue is equivalent to a 1-for-3 issue at 400p a share and 3/4 of
a warrant on the basis of one unit, comprising four ordinary shares and
three warrants, for every 12 shares held. It should raise an initial Pounds
46m net of expenses.
The warrants are exercisable at 525p at any time between December 11 1995
and January 31 1996. If exercised in full, they will raise Pounds 47.6m.
The shares rose 5p to 470p.
The cash-raising exercise comes 12 days after the first clinical trials of
Batimastat, an anti-cancer drug, indicating that it worked well.
Mr James Noble, finance director, acknowledged that the cash call was
opportunistic but added that this was a characteristic of the sector.
Biotech companies spend many years in research and development before a drug
comes to market and must generate cash from markets rather than sales.
Further clinical trial results from other drugs are due later this year. The
summer should see data on Aids and pancreas disease treatments.
He said that the company needed the Pounds 93.6m to take it through the
development phases to drug launches.
Four of the directors intend to take up their rights and the others will
sell some of the rights and buy the rest with the proceeds.
The units will be dealt nil paid from April 15 to May 9 when they will be
split into shares and warrants for fully paid trading.
COMMENT
The rights issue from British Bio-technology is not like that on Monday from
Proteus International. British Bio-tech moved more quickly after the
publication of important clinical trial data, it has already signed deals
with blue chip research-driven pharmaceuticals companies such as Glaxo, and
it has a solid following among City analysts. Once Batimastat enters the
next stage of clinical development later this year, a risk-adjusted net
present valuation of the company comes out at about Pounds 700m. That is the
equivalent of more than Pounds 10 a share, and makes the rights issue look a
bargain for the risk-minded investor.

FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Harland and Wolff cuts loss but
disappointed with result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Harland and Wolff Holdings, the Belfast shipbuilding company, were
cut from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 5.65m pre-tax for the year to end-December.
Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipowner who is Harland's main shareholder and
company chairman, described the results as 'disappointing'.
The company, which was completely reorganised into self-contained business
divisions after privatisation in 1989, said the 1993 deficit included a
charge of Pounds 4.1m for foreseeable losses on contracts which were in hand
at the year end.
With the exception of the holding company, Harland and Wolff Technical
Services and the wholly-owned Trassey Shipping, operations in all companies
resulted in losses.
Harland executives said they were scouring the world for new business as the
order book dwindled.
Mr Per Neilsen, chief executive, said that during 1993 more than 80 per cent
of all operating time in the main shipbuilding company was spent on work on
two ships being built to a new Harland and Wolff design, and all development
costs were charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
He added: 'Furthermore several new processes were implemented, some of which
need further refining in 1994 having failed as yet to meet expectations.
'As a result, total productivity did not improve to the extent expected,
which has increased pressure on the company to reduce costs more speedily in
order to counter-measure the fall in intervention aid and the declining
prices for ships since 1991.'
With short term demand weak and little scope for optimism this year Mr
Neilsen warned of the need to improve productivity rapidly.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pentos incurs Pounds 71m loss and makes
Pounds 45m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the specialist retailing group which includes the Dillons bookshop,
Ryman stationers and Athena cards and poster chains, plans to raise Pounds
45m through a 4-for-3 rights issue at 25p.
At the same time Pentos announced a Pounds 70.6m pre-tax loss for 1993 after
taking significant write-downs and exceptional charges totalling Pounds
56.5m and passed the dividend.
Losses per share of 50.1p compared with earnings of 2.6p a year earlier when
dividends totalled 1.5p.
However, the rights issue and other restructuring moves - including new bank
facilities of up to Pounds 66.7m - were generally welcomed in the market and
the Pentos share price closed 1 1/2 p lower yesterday at 29p.
The proceeds from the 191.9m share issue, which has been fully underwritten
by Schroders, will mainly be used to reduce debt and shore up the group's
battered balance sheet, seriously weakened by the substantial trading losses
and exceptional items last year.
Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 79.3m at the end of 1992 to Pounds
21.5m at the end of last year while bank borrowings, which peaked at Pounds
87m during September, fell to a seasonal low of Pounds 69.3m at the end of
December. A year earlier the figure stood at Pounds 44.1m.
The group's auditors have qualified the 1993 accounts on a going concern
basis, subject to the outcome of the rights issue.
Sir Kit McMahon, who replaced Mr Terry Maher as Pentos' chairman late last
year, said yesterday that the rights issue 'would strengthen the group's
balance sheet and place the group in a better position to implement the
changes necessary to restore profitability.'
Mr Bill McGrath, chief executive since January 1, said the rights issue
would provide 'a firm footing for recovery' and unveiled details of a
two-year business plan designed to restore profitability and 'fulfil the
potential' of the core retail businesses.
The sales-led recovery plan follows a detailed strategic review of each
business conducted by Mr McGrath, formerly deputy chairman of Wickes, and is
designed to emphasis the group's strengths.
The need for a far-reaching rethink of the Pentos business strategy was
underlined yesterday by the group's 1993 results.
The near-Pounds 71m pre-tax loss, which compares with previous profits of
Pounds 4m, came on flat turnover of Pounds 240.7m (Pounds 236.4m) including
sales from continuing operations of Pounds 226.6m (Pounds 217m.)
Excluding exceptional items, Pentos incurred operating losses of Pounds
8.2m, compared with profits of Pounds 12.9m a year earlier.
As previously announced last year's results benefited from gross reverse
premiums of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 6.3m).
Interest costs increased slightly to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 5.4m) resulting in
losses before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 7.5m
profit).
The Pounds 56.5m (Pounds 3.5m) exceptional items included an Pounds 18.7m
provision for losses on the disposal of Ryman Computer Stores, of which
Pounds 14.3m represented the goodwill write-off previously deducted from
reserves.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow achieves Pounds 30m -
Improvement results from lack of property and closure provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow, the house-building, property and construction group, bounced
back into the black in 1993 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.2m against
losses of Pounds 94.5m, restated in accordance with FRS 3.
The improvement reflected the lack of large property and closure provisions
which depressed the restated 1992 figure by Pounds 86.8m.
The final dividend is doubled to 1p for a total of 1.5p (1p), payable from
earnings per share of 4.1p (22.4p losses). The rise in the dividend was
unexpected but the shares were unchanged at 153p.
Profits also benefited from the absence of large provisions on prestige
contracts such as the Channel tunnel, Euro-Disney and Storebaelt which led
to a restated Pounds 61.3m construction loss in 1992.
Last year contracting made a Pounds 1.3m pre-tax profit following the
settlement of claims on Euro-Disney, Storebaelt and John Wayne airport in
the US. Outstanding claims on the Channel tunnel have still to be resolved
but were subject to an interim settlement last summer preventing cash
losses.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, said construction turnover had fallen by 19 per
cent to Pounds 721m reflecting the group's determination to avoid
potentially lossmaking contracts.
Housebuilding moved from a Pounds 26.1m loss to a Pounds 9m profit with
completed sales in the UK, north America, Australia and continental Europe
rising by 31 per cent to 2,769.
In the UK housing completions jumped by 60 per cent to 1,087. There was a
also a strong performance in Florida, offset by a Dollars 10m write-down of
housing land in California.
The group announced plans to raise up to CDollars 35m (Pounds 17.8m) to fund
expansion at its 58.8 per cent owned Canadian and US housebuilding
subsidiary through a public issue of 3m shares. Following the issue Taylor
Woodrow's stake will fall to 54.1 per cent.
Commercial property moved from a Pounds 14.2m loss to a Pounds 14.5m profit.
Some Pounds 69m had been raised from property disposals including Pounds 31m
from the US and Australia where the company was withdrawing from the market.
COMMENT
Management deserves full marks for the way in which it has cut overheads,
brought the balance sheet under control and refocused a series of rather
poorly run separate companies into a coherent business strategy. The rise in
the dividend was a good move psychologically. It was disconcerting, however,
that more information was not available on the status of contracting
provisions. The shares have had a good run of late and most of the good news
is already in the price. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 45m would put the group
on a prospective p/e of more than 24 times which is high enough given that
contracting may yet cast a shadow over better housebuilding and commercial
property results.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Alexon warns of slower recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexon shares tumbled 22 per cent to 47p as the struggling women's wear
group warned that recovery would take longer than expected.
Mr John Osborn, the chief executive appointed last year following a
shareholders' rebellion and two profits warnings, said sales had been
affected by the current economic climate and 'the sheer volume of older
stock that we have sold at discounted levels'.
The group had also made fewer than expected savings on overheads, reducing
costs by Pounds 2m against a target of Pounds 3m. Mr Osborn said Alexon
aimed to make a further Pounds 5m in overhead savings this year.
The chief executive was confident, however, that the group was now on a
'much sounder footing' after a year of reorganisation and the Pounds 16.4m
rights issue in August.
Pre-tax losses were cut by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 12m, on sales 3 per cent
higher to Pounds 111m for the year to January 29. The deficit included
exceptional charges of Pounds 4.35m (Pounds 12.1m) for rationalisation and
operating losses of Pounds 2.35m from the now closed North American
business.
Continuing businesses returned operating losses of Pounds 8.25m, against
Pounds 9.59m last time. There was no dividend and losses per share fell from
53.9p to 30.38p.
Mr Osborn stressed the group's progress on reducing the stock burden, which
precipitated last year's profits warnings and management reshuffle. Stocks
had been cut through heavy discounting by Pounds 11m to Pounds 23.6m.
Net debt had also fallen from Pounds 23m to Pounds 10.7m, representing 48
per cent of shareholders' funds.
Mr Osborn said the launch of the Ann Harvey range of 16+ clothes had been
successful. The brand had been extended from 20 to 38 shops as of last
month.
The Alexon brand had increased sales modestly, although the outlook was more
difficult than had been envisaged. Eastex had performed satisfactorily.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TransTec advances to Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TransTec, formerly known as Transfer Technology, pushed up pre-tax profits
by 19 per cent last year, helped by acquisitions but hindered by difficult
trading in the automotive sector.
The specialist engineering group yesterday announced that pre-tax profits in
the 12 months to end-December were Pounds 11.2m, compared with Pounds 9.45m
in 1992. This produced earnings per share of 8.9p against 8.6p, a figure
adjusted for last October's 5-for-1 subdivision of the shares.
During the current year, Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, expects 'continuing
progress'. For a group which exports 75 per cent of its production, the main
growth will be in the US and, to a lesser extent, east Asia, but European
markets seem likely to remain subdued.
'We remain cautious about any significant improvement over 1993,' Mr
Robinson said of the automotive market.
Last year TransTec suffered from the downturn of the European car market,
and the contribution of the group's automotive division to operating profits
fell from Pounds 3.83m to Pounds 2.53m.
Margins, both in this division and in the inspection systems division, were
under severe pressure.
By contrast the control and manufacturing technology division, enlarged by
two newly-acquired companies, pushed up operating profits from Pounds 5.33m
to Pounds 8.28m.
Total operating profits were Pounds 12.3m, against Pounds 10.3m in 1992.
Turnover rose by Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 145m, with Pounds 32.3m of the
increase coming from new acquisitions - the two companies of the control and
manufacturing division, and one in the automotive division.
The final dividend is 2p, making 3.3p (3.2p) for the year. This is covered
2.7 times by earnings of 8.9p, the same as last time.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bid battle costs restrict Watts Blake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watts Blake Bearne, the clay mining and supply group, said its profits last
year had been held back by the cost of fighting a hostile takeover bid.
The Devon-based group, announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.94m (Pounds
7.25m), said its results for the 12 months to December 31 would have been
better had it not faced an unwelcome offer by Sibelco, a privately owned
Belgian company which owns 46.7 per cent of the group's shares.
Although Sibelco's 420p-a-share offer lapsed last September, WBB incurred
Pounds 910,000 in exceptional costs fighting the bid.
Pre-exceptional profits for the group, which specialises in ball clay
extraction for sanitaryware and tile manufacturers, however, rose by 22 per
cent to Pounds 8.85m on increased turnover of Pounds 76.3m (Pounds 69.8m).
Mr John Pike, managing director, said: 'We are beginning to see more
positive signs, but in our main markets intense price competition remains a
very difficult challenge.'
Earnings per share rose marginally to 23.3p (23.1p), but the group
highlighted a pre-exceptional earnings rise of 20 per cent to 27.7p.
A final dividend of 8.5p (8p), gives a total of 12p (10.7p).

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Interest costs behind decline at Jeyes to
Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong second half and acquisitions helped to cushion the decline at
Jeyes, the cleaning products group which saw 28 per cent of its market value
wiped out after a profits warning in June.
Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, said the inclusion for a full year of
Globol, the German company acquired in 1992, had helped Jeyes to report a 4
per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 6.6m for the year to
January 1.
The pre-tax return, which fell 11 per cent to Pounds 4.9m, had been
depressed by a 77 per cent increase in net interest charges to Pounds 1.38m.
Sales were 28 per cent ahead to Pounds 114.3m. Globol represents about 38
per cent of sales and slightly more of operating profit.
The restructuring programme had been accelerated after poor results in the
first half when profits fell by 82 per cent to Pounds 374,000. Pre-tax
profits in the second half recovered to Pounds 4.5m against Pounds 3.4m last
time.
By the middle of this year five of Jeyes's 10 factories will be closed and
warehousing and distribution transferred to third parties.
Restructuring costs of Pounds 2.9m to pay for these actions were largely
offset by profits from asset sales of Pounds 2.6m.
Mr Moir said the UK division had been hit by aggressive discounting,
although sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 62.5m. Margins were
expected to remain under pressure in the new trading conditions, he said.
The German market had remained stable, with gross margins maintained and a 4
per cent increase in revenues.
Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 9m to support the
reorganisation programme. Gearing rose from 6.4 per cent to 58.8 per cent.
This was expected to fall substantially when the restructuring programme was
completed.
As forecast at the time of the profits warning, the final dividend is being
increased to 4.8p for an 8.1p (7.6p) total. Earnings fell 24 per cent to
16.4p.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tibbett &amp; Britten tops Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tibbett &amp; Britten Group, the distribution company, reported a sharp increase
in sales and profits, mainly because of a full-year contribution from
Silcock Express, the car distributor it bought at the end of 1992 for an
initial Pounds 31.2m.
Tibbett's pre-tax profit rose by 64 per cent to Pounds 24.2m in the year to
December 31, while sales increased by 56 per cent to Pounds 360m.
Mr John Harvey, chairman, said the group had also enjoyed significant
underlying growth. Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent to 37.4p (27.3p).
Of that increase, two thirds was due to Silcock and one third to organic
growth.
The group on Monday further increased its involvement in the motor industry
by agreeing to pay Pounds 15.4m in cash for Toleman, a lossmaking UK car
distribution company.
Depending on its performance, Tibbett may pay up to a further Pounds 2m for
Toleman, which in 1992 made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds
35.8m. Silcock will integrate its operations with Toleman to provide a more
effective service for Ford UK, its largest UK customer, which has promised
to grant the combined operation a long-term rolling contract on a prime
supplier basis.
Mr Harvey said that although the trading environment was challenging, there
was a high level of inquiry in all the group's markets and 1994 promised to
be another lively year, offering substantial organic growth potential.
A final dividend of 9.7p makes a total for the year of 14.2p (11.8p).
COMMENT
A 12p drop in the share price to 813p seemed a grudging response to figures
which were in line with expectations. There may have been some concern over
the ending of several contracts, but some changes are inevitable and the
group was very upbeat about the level of recent inquiries. Just as
impressive was the achievement in lifting net profit margin from 6.4 to 6.7
per cent at a time when there is widespread concern about pressure from food
retailers - even if they now only account for about 20 per cent of group
activity. Forecast profits of Pounds 28m put the shares on a prospective
multiple of 19. The shares are not cheap at this level, but the group's
track record and growth prospects justify the premium rating.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CINVen to manage Royal portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CINVen, the UK's second largest venture capital company is to take over
management of the private equity portfolio of Royal Insurance Asset
Management, writes Richard Gourlay.
Royal Insurance will invest alongside the pension funds of Barclays Bank,
British Rail and British Coal, all of which are already managed by CINVen.
CINVen takes over Royal's Pounds 40m private equity portfolio.
Royal is the latest to hand management of private equity investments to
other professional managers.
Royal will be investing as much as Barclays and the British Rail pension
funds in any CINVen deals, all of which individually invest slightly less
than the British Coal pension fund.
Schroder Ventures, meanwhile, has closed a Pounds 140m buy-out fund, the
group's third fund. Mr Peter Smitham, managing partner, said Schroders'
success 'gave the lie' to the view that it was almost impossible to raise
funds for new venture capital invest-ment.
The fund's closing was delayed by the departure of Mr Jon Moulton, who
resigned after a disagreement over strategy.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Psion's Pounds 3m meets forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Psion, manufacturer of hand-held computers and data communications products,
saw pre-tax profits and sales match market expectations in 1993 helped by
strong demand for the latest version of its palmtop computer and
manufacturing efficiencies.
Profits before tax more than doubled to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 1.42m) on
turnover up 17 per cent to Pounds 41.2m (Pounds 35.1m).
Earnings per share rose from 4.33p to 9.14p and a final dividend of 1.8p
(1.5p) is recommended, making a total for the year of 2.8p (2.5p).
Mr David Potter, founder and chairman, said he was opposed to paying larger
dividends when the company was in a growth phase and would be absorbing
cash.
He said there was no need for the company to raise fresh money in the
immediate future but it had every intention of growing with its markets and
would eventually need extra funding, 'but only on the back of growth and
success'.
The company's four distinct product lines - the Series 3 palmtop computers,
HC industrial hand-held computers, data communications devices and the
original Organiser electronic notebook were all profitable.
Psion is the world's leading supplier of palmtop computers by volume - it is
now producing some 20,000 a month.
Mr Potter said the company had been surprised by demand for the new Series
3a: 'Notwithstanding record production volumes, demand could not be
fulfilled and the supply of product was on allocation . . . it was only
during the first quarter of 1994 that higher volumes of component supplies
have allowed an increase in output.'
Net operating cash flow was Pounds 5.73m compared with Pounds 3.2m in 1992
and working capital was reduced.
The group has surplus cash and negligible net gear-ing.
COMMENT
Psion has had some harsh lessons about markets and management over the past
three years but has recovered well. It now has a portfolio of products each
of which is a leader in a growth area. Its datacommunications products,
including credit card sized modems, look particularly exciting. More than 50
per cent of the group's hardware sales are now made outside the UK. Pre-tax
profits of Pounds 5m look likely this year giving earnings of 15.2p on an
undemanding prospective p/e of 14.9. It is a market sector rich in
quicksands but Psion seems to have found firm footholds at last.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Blenheim knocked by French downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blenheim Group, the exhibitions organiser whose shares have almost halved
over the past year, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 45.2m for 1993 after
a sharp downturn in its important French business. In the preceding 16 month
period to December 1992 it reported profits of Pounds 49.7m.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said: 'Despite difficult conditions Blenheim has
delivered a creditable performance.'
Blenheim's shares fell heavily last summer after a Pounds 76m convertible
preference share issue in June was followed by downgraded forecasts.
The French recession hit Blenheim in the second half with space at its
annual shows in France down by 10 per cent and another decline expected this
year. Across the group revenues from the existing annual shows rose 4.4 per
cent with operating margins rising to 25 per cent on turnover of Pounds
198.7m. However Mr Buch warned: 'Exhibitions are late cycle with space sales
responding some 15 to 18 months later than the general economic cycle.'
The current year will also be affected by the absence of Batimat, its large
biennial exhibition in France, which contributes an estimated 15 per cent of
group profit.
Earnings per share reached 29.4p in 1993 against 32.4p in the preceding 16
months, including Batimat, or a pro forma 20.1p, without Batimat.
A final dividend of 6.85p (3p) gives a total of 10.25p up from pro forma 9p
for 1992.
Blenheim ended the year with net debt of Pounds 26m including the
convertible loan stock and negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 83.9m. The
1993 interest bill of Pounds 5m was covered ten times by operating profit.
COMMENT
Mr Staffan Svenby, who moved up to managing director in November, has
already started to bite into Blenheim's 1980s-style cost base. The programme
for new exhibition launches has been halved, some existing shows will be
axed and the 800-strong workforce slimmed. But exhibition profits remain
highly sensitive to economic cycles - UK profits are now half their peak -
and there is nothing Mr Svenby can do about the French economy. Given the
long lead time for Batimat, next year's profits will be determined by French
business confidence in the next few months and any sign of a double-dip
recession will have analysts scurrying to downgrade their forecasts. That
explains why the shares, down 5p at 343p, are trading on only 13 times next
year's predicted earnings.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline advances to Pounds 2.6m
after reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hodder Headline, the publisher which has now virtually finished the
reconstruction following the merger of Headline and Hodder &amp; Stoughton,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits for the year to end December up 27 per
cent to Pounds 2.6m after exceptionals.
Exceptional costs and provisions including redundancy payments associated
with the reorganisation totalled Pounds 6.5m, only slightly greater than
expected.
Before the exceptional items operating and pre-tax profits were more than
doubled at Pounds 4.6m and Pounds 4.5m respectively.
Earnings per share before exceptionals were up 4 per cent to 12.4p but after
exceptionals there was a drop of 48 per cent to 6.2p.
Sales more than doubled to Pounds 51.1m, boosted by the second half revenues
of Hodder &amp; Stoughton following the merger.
There is a recommended final up 12 per cent to 3.35p, making a total of 5p
(4.5p).
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, group chief executive said the benefits from the
reorganisation were now beginning to flow and annual full-year savings of
Pounds 4m net would become apparent from the middle of this year.
'This comprehensive overhaul, particularly of Hodder &amp; Stoughton will be
largely completed by the end of May and is the main story behind the figures
this year,' he said.
The group is planning a number of new ventures this year including the
launch of an audio division. A new subsidiary is also being set up to
publish low priced reprints - hardbacks at about Pounds 5.
Hodder has already had two number one best-sellers this year - Thomas
Keneally's Schindler's List and Edwina Currie's A Parliamentary Affair.
The Hodder Headline share price closed down 1p at 407p.

FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson buys PosTel properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hammerson, the UK's fifth largest property company, yesterday unveiled the
acquisition of a Pounds 143.3m property portfolio from Postel, in a deal
that leaves the pension fund with a 12.3 per cent stake in Hammerson.
The acquisition is Hammerson's first big deal since its Pounds 199m rights
issue and change of management last year. Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive,
said the purchase was in line with the company's new strategy of rebalancing
its portfolio and adopting a more active investment policy.
The portfolio, which includes the Queensmere Shopping Centre in Slough and
the HMV store in Oxford Street, is expected to give Hammerson scope to
improve values by redevelopment and more active management.
Postel's sale of the portfolio is the result of a long-term plan to
liquidate the properties held in one of its funds. 'This is a way of staying
exposed to the property market while the cycle is still positive, while
enjoying the benefits of more entrepreneurial management,' said Mr Alastair
Ross Goobey, chief executive.
Payment for the six properties, which comprise 563,000 sq ft of retail space
and 231,000 sq ft of offices generating rental income of Pounds 10.9m a
year, takes the form of Pounds 25.3m cash and 31.9m new shares at 370p each.
Although the deal was well received by the City, Hammerson's share price
fell by 8p to 354p as investors reacted with disappointment to the company's
1993 results, which revealed a greater than expected fall in net asset value
from 384p to 343p.
Hammerson's portfolio declined by 5.1 per cent in value to Pounds 1.46bn,
after a 13.6 per cent decline in the company's properties in continental
Europe, North America and Australasia and a 9.1 per cent increase in its UK
properties. Its UK office portfolio increased by 14.2 per cent in value; its
UK retail portfolio rose by 4.5 per cent.
Hammerson's pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 39.8m.
Operating profits, excluding exceptional items relating to provisions and
investment sales, were flat at Pounds 96.4m (Pounds 96.8m). Net rental
income dropped by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 117.6m.
Hammerson warned pressure could continue on the company's rental income
until there was a widespread improvement in tenant demand.
Earnings per share rose to 13.9p, compared with a loss per share of 2.7p;
after excluding exceptional items, earnings remained constant at 10.2p. A
final dividend of 6.5p makes an unchanged total of 10p for the year.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Next boosted by buoyant high street sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next, the UK fashion chain, demonstrated its continuing rapid recovery
yesterday with the announcement of a near doubling of full-year pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 73.5m.
The group, which was one of the most successful retailers of the 1980s but
ran into difficulties when it over-expanded, has now seen profits recover
from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 73.5m in two years.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said sales in the high street stores
increased 17.8 per cent in the year to January 31, from selling space 1.6
per cent higher. The strong sales performance had continued so far this
year, with year-on-year growth running at nearly 18 per cent.
He said the upturn was the result of improvements in product range and
customer service, as well as better presentation in the stores and the mail
order business, Next Directory. The Next brand had been strengthened by a
move to selling the same range through both the high street and the mail
order division.
Lord Wolfson, chairman, said Next had returned to its roots selling 'good
quality, good taste and fashion, but not high fashion'. The fact that the
group had run into difficulties as early as 1989 had made recovery easier as
it had been able to dispose of many lossmaking outlets before the property
market slumped in the 1990s.
Group sales increased from Pounds 484.7m to Pounds 544.2m. High street sales
were up from Pounds 332.9m to Pounds 392.3m, with operating profits rising
from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 44.1m.
Sales in Next Directory increased from Pounds 90.8m to Pounds 98.8m, and
operating profits from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 8.5m.
Turnover at Club 24, Next's credit management business, fell from Pounds
41.8m to Pounds 33.3m, but profits increased from Pounds 3m to Pounds 9.1m.
Next USA, the US joint venture of which Next owns 78 per cent, made sales of
Pounds 600,000 since the first store opened in Boston in September, but a
loss of Pounds 1.8m including start-up costs. The group is opening another
store in Washington DC in April and would like to open a second Boston
store.
'The US experiment will be very slow, very considered, and we will decide
over the next 12 to 18 months whether it is something we can roll out,' Mr
Jones said.
Earnings per share increased from 9.9p to 17.3p, and the proposed final
dividend is 4p, lifting the total from 2.5p to 5.5p.

FT  30 MAR 94 / GKN fails to secure Westland agreement: 'Unbridgeable gap'
develops between helicopter maker and engineering group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN's Pounds 497m hostile takeover bid for Westland, the helicopter
manufacturer, moved towards a climax yesterday after a meeting between the
chairmen of the two companies broke up without agreement. This leaves the
engineering group with just two days in which to revise its 290p-a-share
offer.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, had a 'friendly but frank' 35-minute
discussion with Sir David Lees - his GKN counterpart - but is understood to
have firmly rejected the bid.
After the meeting, the rival executives issued a joint statement: 'In all
matters relating to Westland, there is an unbridgeable gap between us.'
Throughout the bid, Mr Jones has criticised GKN, which controls 45 per cent
of Westland, for undervaluing its order prospects and potential profits.
Those prospects were enhanced yesterday when McDonnell Douglas Helicopters,
the US manufacturer, announced it had reached agreement with EH Industries -
a partnership between Westland and Agusta of Italy - to market the partners'
EH101 helicopter in North America.
McDonnell Douglas said it would seek orders from the US Navy, which has a
requirement for more than 500 'medium lift replacement' helicopters. The
contract could exceed Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 5.2bn).
The US company would manufacture the EH101 under licence at its plant in
Mesa, Arizona. Mr Erv Hunter, vice-president of military programs at
McDonnell Douglas, said the first US EH101s could be delivered in 1999.
Any sales in North America would be an invaluable fillip for Westland, which
has so far secured 44 firm orders for the EH101.
Mr Jones said: 'The way forward for Westland is increasingly through
collaboration with other helicopter manufacturers.'
During the bid, he has warned that Westland's ability to forge such
alliances would be compromised if GKN won full control.
GKN is understood to be considering a revised offer of around 320p a share,
but that would not be enough to overcome the Westland board's objections.
Forecasting increased profits and dividends earlier this week, Mr Jones said
the company was worth more than 400p-a-share to GKN.
Westland shares remained unchanged yesterday at 325p.

FT  30 MAR 94 / BAe shows Pounds 2.9bn leasing exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace disclosed yesterday that it has aircraft leasing
obligations of Pounds 2.9bn, compared with income that it expects to receive
on sub-leases to airlines of Pounds 1.8bn.
Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director, said that losses on these leases and
the costs of restructuring the aviation business brought BAe near to
collapse over the past couple of years. 'We got very close,' he said.
Only an undisclosed part of sub-lease income is contractually committed,
though the group believes its estimate of what it will receive is prudent.
At the end of last year, provisions to cover the risk of leasing losses
stood at Pounds 653m.
BAe sold aircraft to banks and leased them back under agreements lasting
between 15 and 20 years, depending on aircraft type. It then rented them on
sub-leases of between three and five years to airlines.
Losses are made by BAe if sub-leases are not renewed. Mr Lapthorne said
that, in the past, BAe booked profits on these sales to banks and made only
small provisions to cover the risk of these losses. 'We have over-reported
profits in the past,' he said.
Mr Terry Smith, analyst at brokers Collins Stewart, said: 'These leasing
liabilities are extraordinary. We thought BAe was selling the planes to
airlines rather than renting them out on a short term basis.'
In the past three years, BAe's commercial aircraft division has lost Pounds
1.79bn in aggregate, including exceptional reorganisation costs and
provisions against losses on the leases, but excluding tax and interest
payments.

FT  30 MAR 94 / How US pension plans are going international
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget for the moment about exciting and dangerous hedge funds, but look
instead at those dull and staid US pension funds. Worth some Dollars 2,500bn
(Pounds 1,700bn), they put Mr George Soros and his ilk into perspective. And
there are important structural changes taking place, with global
implications.
A survey of the US pensions industry from the Connecticut consultants
Greenwich Associates* spells out the massive shift into international assets
now proceeding.
At the end of last year the average fund had 8 per cent in non-US assets
(6.4 per cent in equities, 1.6 per cent in bonds) compared with only 4.4 per
cent in 1991. Moreover the international exposure is expected by plan
managers to hit 12 per cent by the end of 1996. Again, that would be very
largely in stocks, at 9.6 per cent against 2.4 per cent for international
bonds.
The sleepiest plan sponsors, even in the public sector, appear to be waking
up, and there is a frantic scramble to find global managers. Half of the
funds surveyed by Greenwich had international portfolios at the end of last
year, and half of the remainder intended to start buying international
assets within 12 months.
Public sector funds - half of the industry in terms of assets - have tended
to lag behind, and still have only 5.6 per cent overseas against 9 per cent
for corporate funds. However, on present plans the public funds will have
almost caught up in three years' time.
What does this mean for markets around the world? Already we have seen 100
per cent surges in several Asian markets in 1993 as US money, not all from
pension funds, has sloshed around. The pension funds and similarly run
endowments and foundations now own global equities worth some Dollars 170bn,
and they plan to raise this to Dollars 300bn over three years. So although
there may be further Hong Kong-style setbacks, as we have seen in 1994 so
far, the money will keep flowing, perhaps at Dollars 30bn-plus annually.
The bond picture, incidentally, is not so dramatic. US tax-exempt funds hold
Dollars 42bn of global bonds according to this survey, and plan to raise the
aggregate to Dollars 75bn over three years. Governments around Europe alone
will happily eat that rate of inflow for breakfast.
So much for the expansionary features of US pension funds. Overall, though,
they are far from buoyant, with the corporate plans shrinking. This applies
particularly to corporate defined benefit (in UK parlance, final
salary-linked) plans which are estimated to have suffered a negative cash
flow of Dollars 36bn in 1993. But the public sector plans and the corporate
defined contribution (or money purchase) plans are still enjoying net
inflows.
Defined contribution plans accounted for 30 per cent of all corporate plan
assets in 1990, but the proportion has risen to 37 per cent today and could
be 60 per cent in 10 years' time. They have a much lower international
equity proportion - only 0.8 per cent against 9.7 per cent for defined
benefit corporate plans. Remarkably, the defined contribution plans have on
average 31 per cent of their assets in the sponsoring company's own stock,
representing a worrying concentration of risk for beneficiaries - although
on the other hand the current bid battle for Grumman has boosted the value
of the company's 401(k) plan by some Dollars 250m.
It is worth asking, in view of the defined contribution growth, how
permanent the US pension funds' voyage overseas may prove. The international
shift appears to be motivated by a search for higher returns without undue
increases in risks. Expected returns on US assets have declined, pushing
funds further into equities (with exposure to domestic bonds down 2.3
percentage points to 32.7 per cent in two years). Both small capitalisation
domestic stocks and foreign stocks have benefited from this search for extra
return. Emerging markets, heavily marketed, have offered tempting returns.
Last year the US was the worst-performing main stock market in dollar terms,
but it may not look relatively nearly so bad in 1994. The pension plans'
rush abroad is probably unstoppable in the medium term, but a bad period for
international returns could yet cause plan sponsors to put their more
ambitious plans on ice for a while.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Post Office urges stock market sale of minority shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management of the Post Office is pressing for a stock market flotation
through the public offer of a minority shareholding in an attempt to
dissuade the government from shelving privatisation as politically
unacceptable.
The suggested scheme - the sale of a 30-40 per cent stake - is known as the
'BP option', so-called because British Petrolem was government-controlled
but publicly quoted for most of this century before being sold off in the
late 1980s. Under Treasury rules, it was allowed to act as a private company
throughout.
Using this model, it is argued, would maintain the government's
responsibility for the Post Office's operations, reassuring the public about
the level of service. It would also give the Post Office the freedom to
borrow without adding to the government's budget deficit.
Privatisation is opposed by a number of backbench Tory MPs, who are worried
about the possible closure of village post offices and the withdrawal of
postal services to remote areas.
In an effort to placate them, the scheme proposes legislation stating that
before selling any further shares in the Post Office, the government would
have to seek permission from parliament.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said he believes
there is a strong economic case for privatisation. He is thought to favour
the sale of the Royal Mail together with the lossmaking Parcelforce, while
leaving the more politically sensitive Post Office Counters within the
public sector. However, the Post Office fears that the whole project may be
abandoned as too politically sensitive.
While the Post Office continues to press for commercial freedom, it claims
to have no preference for how it is obtained. Mr Bill Cockburn, managing
director, said: 'It doesn't really matter which route is taken, provided
it's a means to an end. If the government decides to separate the
businesses, the Post Office will work with the government to make that
successful.'
This would be equally true if the BP option were applied to the Royal Mail
alone, he said. 'The worst option is for the government to do nothing.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / S Africa moves against Natal political violence: Election
body agrees emergency powers in principle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Emergency measures to combat political violence in South Africa's troubled
Natal province were agreed in principle yesterday by the multi-party body
overseeing the transfer of power through all-race elections next month.
The move by the Transitional Executive Council followed a countrywide outcry
over Monday's gun battles in central Johannesburg which pitted the mainly
Zulu Inkatha Freedom party against the African National Congress.
'Natal is sliding into a bottomless pit of death and destruction. Something
must be done immediately,' Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, told
the council, the de facto interim government.
The council said it would draft legislation to impose a state of emergency
in Natal, or to declare 'unrest areas' where police would have special
powers. The council agreed in principle to impose such powers, but did not
do so immediately.
Any such actions would amount to a decision to impose central government
authority against Inkatha, headed by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi who is
seeking to have the elections delayed. The council's aim would be to ensure
that campaigning could take place in Natal.
Such a move could, however, provoke bitter resistance from a diehard group
of armed Buthelezi supporters, and call into question the loyalty of some
members of the security forces, elements of which have in the past shown
sympathies with Inkatha.
Much may depend on the outcome of a planned peace summit between South
Africa's four most powerful leaders, which was to have started today but has
been postponed until next week.
ANC officials were angry at the postponement, which was caused by Zulu King
Goodwill Zwelithini's refusal to attend a summit over the Easter weekend. He
said his people needed time to bury their dead before the summit.
Police said the death toll from Monday's violence had risen to 53, and there
were sporadic incidents of shooting in central Johannesburg again yesterday.
Hopes of progress at next week's meeting seemed slim after the ANC and
Inkatha traded blame for the deaths. Chief Buthelezi accused the ANC of
planning to massacre Zulu marchers. 'No reasonable person could possibly
doubt what took place near the Shell House headquarters of the ANC . . . was
a wilful slaughter of people who had every democratic right in the world to
be where they were and doing what they were doing,' he said.
But public reaction to Monday's events has been overwhelmingly to condemn
Inkatha for having provoked the attack.

FT  30 MAR 94 / 'Crazy' rules on aid and trade denounced by top
industrialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three leading British industrialists yesterday accused the government of
undermining their companies' bids for contracts in developing countries by
introducing 'crazy' aid and trade rules in the aftermath of the Pergau dam
affair.
Sir Robin Biggam, BICC chairman; Mr John Lippitt, a GEC director; and Mr
Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, said British aid and trade
provision regulations made it extremely difficult to compete against
European rivals.
They claim the government's use of the annual Pounds 100m aid and trade
provision budget had been restricted by new rules limiting the number of
countries and contracts for which funds could be used. This budget channels
UK development aid intended for the purchase of British goods.
'Our government's policy is totally wrong,' Mr Lippitt told the Commons
foreign affairs committee. 'It's crazy.' He claimed that restrictive aid and
trade rules were the main reason GEC did not win two contracts to help build
Chinese underground systems worth hundreds of millions of pounds.
The government came under fierce attack after Pounds 234m from the
provision's budget was granted to the Malaysian government in 1991 towards
construction of the Pergau dam.
After the Pergau deal, the Overseas Development Administration decided funds
could only be given to countries with a per capita income under Dollars 700,
a figure that would now exclude Malaysia. It compares with a peak of Dollars
2,465 suggested by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development. The ODA also set a limit of Pounds 46m on the amount of
government money that could go to any single project receiving aid and trade
provision funds.
However, Sir Robin, whose company is the parent of Balfour Beatty which is
contributing to the Pergau project, said his company could not take full
advantage of the aid and trade provision scheme.
'We will be denied the use of ATP in any country above those limits of per
capita income,' he said. 'We will simply not be able to compete.'
Mr Gormly said such funding was essential for companies wanting to set up
long-term business contacts in a region.
Mr Lippitt cited examples of how the Bonn government had helped German
companies gain lucrative contracts in China.
In the case of a contract for the Shanghai metro system, the British
government offered the Chinese 31 per cent of the costs of the project in
aid and trade provision grant. But Bonn offered 51 per cent.
He said GEC was again beaten in bidding for the Guangzhou metro, with the UK
offering 35 per cent of grant costs in aid and trade provision compared with
Germany's 68 per cent.

<TEXT>
Norwich Union's move to retrain and prune its sales force is an especially
radical version of action being taken elsewhere. Prudential's sales are
suffering as its direct sales force is overhauled, Legal &amp; General is
engaged in a similar process. That a blue-chip company like Norwich Union
has been compelled to take such draconian steps hints at the true extent of
the problem. Shedding 300 salesmen may have as much to do with economics as
compliance, but the two issues are closely linked. It will prove far more
difficult to sell life insurance contracts and personal pensions in great
volume under a regulatory regime which demands commission disclosure and
sound selling practice.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With around one-third of its shares now held outside Switzerland, Ciba's
policy of openness has paid off. The 40 per cent rise in the shares last
year - keeping pace with the soaring Swiss market - might also owe something
to improved disclosure and the adoption of international accounting
standards. But while Ciba's plan to do away with non-voting shares is
another welcome step, glasnost can only propel the shares so far.
Further progress turns on the earnings outlook, which is far from clear.
Looming US generic competition for two of Ciba's biggest drugs is a reason
for caution about the immediate prospects - although the combined sales
affected of Dollars 500m are modest in the context of the wider group. By
reducing the headcount in pharmaceuticals by more than 1,000 last year, Ciba
has also shown willingness to adapt. Such measures should limit the damage.
To push its rating higher, Ciba will have to prove that its research
pipeline is capable of producing blockbusting new products. Meanwhile,
cost-cutting in agrochemicals and the first glimmers of industrial recovery
in Europe look the best hopes for growth. That is more than many pure drugs
companies have to offer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's financial markets wanted a clear outcome to the general elections.
They have not really got one. Forming a government promises to be a much
harder task for the rightwing Freedom Alliance than winning the election,
and the markets have some grounds for anxiety about how its policies will
turn out.
The stock market might relish the continuation of the privatisation
programme: some juicy offerings are coming up in the insurance and energy
sector. But it is hard to square the Alliance's commitment to lower taxes
with continuing reduction of the budget deficit. If that approach did not
work in Reagan's America, it is unlikely to in Berlusconi's Italy.
Arguably both equities and bonds are cheap. With inflation heading below 4
per cent this year, long-term yields of over 9 per cent provide a
substantial real return. A prospective cash flow multiple of around six
times is not demanding for equities, especially since Italy's strong export
performance since the lira's exit from the ERM is starting to generate
healthy growth in industrial earnings.
Yesterday's weakness in both markets suggests that the political fog will
have to clear before these factors come to the fore. There are risks along
the way. Not least is the possibility that worries about fiscal policy might
cause the Bank of Italy to go slow on interest rate cuts. With the domestic
economy still weak, that would be particularly worrying for equities.

<TEXT>
It has been a long and rocky road from the sprawl of Gardening Next and
Next's neighbourly newsagents to the focused clothing retailer with net cash
of Pounds 88m and profits of Pounds 74m. That transformation owes a great
deal to the management team led by Lord Wolfson and Mr David Jones. Still,
even they acknowledge their good fortune in hitting trouble early in
recession, while there was still a market for surplus retail sites.
There is also a sparkle of magic about Next's survival. The brand has
remained strong, in contrast to would-be competitors like Principles and
Richards, where the red ink still flows freely. Next is in the happy
position where it can avoid the blight of semi-permanent discounting,
maintaining high margins and high sales volumes from limited space.
Its rapidly mounting cash pile suggests that the company is about to
diversify. Yet if its cautious US experiment is any guide, the money will
not burn a hole in management's pocket. Cash gives flexibility and Next can
still grow in the UK by moving stores to larger premises. The 120 per cent
increase in the dividend also shows that there is still plenty for
shareholders to look forward to.

FT  30 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Hammerson nails a deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a topsy-turvy feel to the property market at this stage in the
recovery. Shares are trading at premiums to asset values; capital values are
rising sharply while rents are still falling; and British Land and Hammerson
are buying assets from institutional investors when most property companies
would normally expect to sell to them.
Still, both Hammerson and PosTel have reason to be pleased with their deal.
By swapping a bundle of properties for Hammerson shares, PosTel is
increasing its stake in a geared recovery stock from 1.2 per cent to 12.3
per cent. PosTel will eventually be able liquidate those shares more easily
than property. Hammerson is in effect buying short-term earnings, which is
useful given the strain of maintaining its dividend. Thereafter, it should
be able to lift the initial yield of 7.6 per cent through more active
management and redevelopment.
But by marking Hammerson's shares down 2 per cent, the market focused more
on the puzzling movements in its asset values rather than the attractions of
the deal. It is hard to understand how Hammerson's US assets could have
dropped 42 per cent over the year. The 5 per cent rise in Hammeron's UK
retail assets also appears meagre given the significant shift in capital
values elsewhere. Property investors must hope that reflects more on the
ambitious valuations previously attached to Hammerson's portfolio rather
than any cooling of the market overall.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Monopolies body clears ice cream makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's leading ice cream manufacturers were yesterday cleared of
anti-competitive distribution practices by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The commission said the practice of supplying freezers free to shops on
condition they were not used to stock ice cream from other suppliers did not
operate against the public interest.
Nor was it convinced that consumer choice 'would be significantly improved
were exclusivity to be ended'.
A nine-month inquiry into the supply of 'impulse ice creams' - bought for
immediate consumption - concluded there was no evidence of excessive prices
or excessive profits being made as a result of freezer exclusivity.
The decision could bring the UK competition authorities into conflict with
Brussels where the European Commission is also examining the issue. It
indicated recently that it regards freezer exclusivity as a serious barrier
to market entry.
The MMC report was welcomed by Birds Eye Walls, the UK ice cream subsidiary
of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. The company has over
half the total UK impulse market valued at Pounds 275m in 1992. It said the
report was a 'clear vindication' of its policy of pursuing freezer
exclusivity.
The report's conclusions were condemned by Mars, the US food products group,
which wants the practice outlawed. Mars, which has achieved 16 per cent of
the UK impulse market since entering the ice cream business in 1989, said
the report 'protects Wall's existing and profitable exclusive distribution
arrangements'.
The MMC was also criticised by the Consumers' Association for a
'muddle-headed and misguided report'.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Smiling as long as he can: After his election fillip, Silvio
Berlusconi now faces a difficult job forming a government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As befits a man who brought popular entertainment to Italian television,
Silvio Berlusconi has a well-rehearsed smile.
Throughout a bitter, and at times venomous, election campaign, Mr Berlusconi
wore this smile like a badge of self-confidence. But early yesterday morning
as he stepped onto the podium of his Forza Italia headquarters to
acknowledge the extraordinary victory of his Freedom Alliance, he was tense
and grim-faced.
It was as though the 57-year-old media magnate sensed the real metamorphosis
from businessman to politician. Forza Italia had won the largest number of
votes and become the largest single party in parliament after less than four
month's existence - a feat without parallel in the recent history of
European democracy.
'It's probably quite a shock to realise that winning the elections is the
easy part. Trying to put together a government is going to be much tougher,'
observed one of his aides.
Having masterminded the three-party Freedom Alliance, which has won an
absolute majority in Italy's lower parliamentary chamber, Mr Berlusconi will
be the first to be asked by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to form a
government. But in his ambition to become prime minister, Mr Berlusconi has
gathered some odd bedfellows who may find it impossible to cohabit in
government.
Thus there is a curious paradox in the election result. The composition of
the winning coalition - Forza Italia, the populist Northern League of Mr
Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco
Fini - may not be that of the next government. The Freedom Alliance has no
common programme of government, even if its constituents represent a clear
swing towards the right of the political spectrum after the many years of
centre and centre-left governments.
The biggest problem is the difference between the personalities and thinking
of Mr Bossi and Mr Fini. Mr Bossi is a federalist and a free-marketeer who
in the last decade has made a political career by founding a grassroots
movement in northern Italy to supplant the abuse of power by the traditional
ruling parties. Mr Fini, who describes himself as a 'post-fascist', is heir
to the centralised and corporatist traditions of the Mussolini state.
The election pact between the three parties was a marriage of convenience,
and in no constituency did all three support each others' candidates. Mr
Berlusconi forged a formal pact with Mr Bossi to pool resources in the
north. Separately, Mr Berlusconi organised a deal with Mr Fini to join
forces in the centre and south of the country. The League and the
MSI/National Alliance were linked through the person of Mr Berlusconi and by
their dependence upon Fininvest's media empire to back their campaigns.
Repeatedly during the campaign Mr Bossi bad-mouthed Mr Fini and rejected the
idea of governing with him. Mr Bossi said again yesterday: 'There's a
reactionary right around; and I would never be party to a government with a
reactionary right.'
Part of this is bluff to maximise his bargaining position, which has been
eroded by the loss of votes to Forza Italia in the north. But joining the
MSI in government would undermine his credibility among supporters, and
threaten the League with absorption by Forza Italia. Alternatively, the
League could split, with some deserting to the Berlusconi camp - there are
already reports of overtures to several leading League members.
In any event, Mr Berlusconi will be hard pressed to find another grouping in
parliament to form a coalition with the MSI. One way out of this impasse
would be a Forza Italia/League government which excluded the MSI but had its
explicit backing in parliament.
Another scenario would be for Mr Berlusconi and the League to seek allies
with the centrist Italian Pact, headed by Mr Mario Segni. This would have
the attraction of helping to provide an absolute majority in the Senate, or
upper chamber. The lack of such a majority is a serious handicap, since the
upper house can block legislation.
Mr Segni refused to make a pre-electoral alliance with Mr Berlusconi's Forza
Italia - a factor which forced Mr Berlusconi into the arms of the League and
the MSI. But Mr Segni himself paid dearly for spurning a deal with Mr
Berlusconi. He ended up being squeezed between the Freedom Alliance on the
right and the Progressive Alliance on the left.
Mr Segni may be more malleable after his disappointing performance in the
polls. But if the centre joins Mr Berlusconi in government, Mr Bossi will be
none too happy. He claims Mr Segni and his friends are no more than recycled
members of the discredited regimes of the Christian Democrats and Socialists
until 1992.
None of these possible outcomes augurs well for the formation of a stable
government capable of lasting the full five years of the next legislature.
Indeed, President Scalfaro may find Mr Berlusconi cannot form a viable
government and turn to an 'institutional' figure such as outgoing premier Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy.
The 'institutional' solution, however, could be foisted on the country only
in extremis. This is because the electorate has expressed through this
week's elections a clear verdict in favour of political renewal and against
the old political system.
In this respect, there is one common link between the parties of the Freedom
Alliance: either they are untainted by previous government experience or
they aspire to represent the majority of Italians who want the country to
turn a new page. In contrast, the Progressives, dominated by the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), was weakened by being
identified with the old political system.
This link is the only common ground on which Mr Berlusconi can build. He has
to demonstrate that victory can bring his partners closer, not push them
apart.
But even if an alliance can be forged, Mr Berlusconi has also to prove that
he is not simply an invention of his own television network. Television
launched him into an unbeatable lead. He and his advisers were smart enough
to see the vacuum left by the traditional centre parties and sense that his
audience, middle class Italy, was worried by a deep recession and wanted a
simple reassuring message. His television exposure, coupled with the
managerial talent of Fininvest, his debt-burdened media and stores group
which set up the countrywide support network for Forza Italia, did the rest.
He now has to move from the soft sell of campaign promises to the harsh
reality of operating with a new parliament and tackling the serious issues
raised by Italy's substantial budget deficit and the mounting state debt.
His pledge to cut taxes and relaunch the economy will be hard, if not
impossible, to square with the need to introduce a mini-budget in the
summer. A shortfall in revenues will have to be corrected if he is to hold
the public deficit below 10 per cent of GDP. Equally his pledge to shake-up
the public administration and liberalise the labour market risks a
confrontation with the unions.
Until now, Italy has been governed, for better or worse, on a consensual
basis with limited shifts in policy. If Mr Berlusconi forms a government by
looking solely to the League and the MSI, this would mark a new departure,
allowing the creation of a genuine opposition and a more confrontational
style of politics. The obstacles in his path are immense, but Mr
Berlusconi's style is to win and the election has shown that, despite his
political inexperience, his capacity to come out on top should not be
underestimated.

What now for Sir Christopher Bland, 55, former chairman of LWT? He hasn't
had to hang around waiting for job offers after Granada's takeover of his
ITV company. He's understood to have been approached for the London
Transport job. He also politely declined the chance to be a candidate to
take over from Sir George Russell as chairman of the Independent Television
Commission, when Russell retires at the end of this year.
It's believed that Bland, the former deputy chairman of the old IBA, is
holding out for a run at the chairmanship of the BBC, a post that Sir George
Russell, 58, is unlikely to turn down.
Standing in the way of the ambitions of both is the determined figure of
Marmaduke Hussey who has absolutely no intention of giving up the
chairmanship before the end of his term in November 1996. In the meantime,
Russell has a proper job as chairman of 3i which he will be bringing to the
stock market. Perhaps Bland should think again about the London Transport
job.

Johannesburg to cover the elections. Wisely, he ordered a flak jacket in

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An inventive idea for tarting up an office reception area comes from the CIA
group. CIA has nothing to do with poison-tipped umbrellas; it's one of the
UK's more flourishing media-buying outfits.
The company has fitted three computer game screens in the waiting room so
that it might look 'more like a media company and less like a hotel', says
chairman Chris Ingram.
So instead of kicking their heels or thumbing through dog-eared magazines,
visitors may now play 'Dragon's Lair' or 'Zombies Ate My Neighbour'. But
Chris - if you really wanted it to look more like a media office - where are
the stiletto-encrusted backs, the spite-filled memos, the vindictive award
ceremonies, the . . .?

FT  30 MAR 94 / Observer: Questionable probe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Gummer, Britain's environment minister, thinks that two-thirds of those
Londoners who filled in a questionnaire on their wishes for the capital's
future did not vote for a strategic authority along the lines of the old
Greater London Council.
That seems a trifle disingenuous - after all, they were never asked that
question. True, says the environment department. 'There was no direct
question . . . but people were asked for their suggestions,' an official
suggested.
In that case, it's surely astonishing that one-third said there was a need
for a resurrected GLC or its equivalent. Ask no questions and I'll tell you
no lies; mind you, truth's at a premium these days, it seems.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Observer: Major vs Marlow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Commons experienced a frisson of history when Tony Marlow
became the first Tory MP since Leo Amery - 54 years ago - to call in such
stark terms in the Commons for the resignation of his own leader and prime
minister.
Amery, a diminutive figure but much more of a political heavyweight than
Marlow, told Neville Chamberlain to go after the failure of the Norwegian
campaign in May 1940.
Amery quoted Cromwell's declaration to the long parliament: 'You have sat
here too long for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us
have done with you. In the name of God, go.' Chamberlain went two days
later, and Churchill took over. We spy no Churchills in the wings in 1994.

Are the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England,
who hold their monthly monetary meeting today, on first name terms?
And if they are, should the governor - Eddie George - refer to the
chancellor as Kenneth, or Ken? Clarke has only limited control over what
newspapers call him and doesn't appear to have issued edicts on the matter.
But precedents have already been set; lengthy investigation indicates that
in the past year the UK's non-tabloid newspapers have increasingly referred
to the beer-drinking chancellor as 'Ken'. Admittedly, it's only one 'Ken'
per 28 'Kenneths'; but that's a remarkable shift on the previous year's
tally of only one 'Ken' for every 52 'Kenneths'. John Major has taken to
calling him 'Ken', as has the Treasury's Stephen - not 'Steve', note -
Dorrell.
Where will all this vulgar chumminess end? Are we headed for the demotically
inclined Mick Heseltine, Dougie Hurd and Sir Norm Fowler?

FT  30 MAR 94 / Personal View: Faulty picture of multimedia world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN LEVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A remarkable conventional wisdom has emerged among business executives and
consultants in the television, computer and telephony industries. It is that
they are inexorably converging. While some blurring of boundaries is
undoubtedly happening, the importance of this trend compared with some other
changes under way has been exaggerated.
The computer and telecommunications industries have been eyeing each other
longingly for many years without ever consummating their relationship.
Now entertainment has entered the picture, with media conglomerates like
Time Warner of the US courting telephone companies. Cable operators are
nibbling at BT's local telephone monopoly. BT is toying with
movies-on-demand over telephone lines.
To add to the confusion, everyone is babbling about multimedia, a term even
more elastic than back to basics.
By 2000, according to the pundits, the distinctions between content and
carriage, medium and message, will be so blurred that television, telephone,
publishing and computer companies will all be subsumed in one vast
multimedia 'infotainment' industry, worth more than Dollars 1,000bn. This is
fanciful.
All of these industries are certainly going through tumultuous times.
Broadcast television has ceased to be a protected oligopoly. In the US, the
old networks' share of total viewing has already dropped by half. In the UK,
the BBC and ITV companies will inevitably lose market share to new cable and
satellite channels, as will traditional broadcasters in continental Europe.
Competition in telecoms has, to date, been introduced by regulatory fiat in
the US and UK, and largely confined to long-distance traffic. However, new
technologies like cellular telephony, satellite and cable, offering genuine
alternatives to the old copper wires, will push prices down.
The computer hardware industry has already become ferociously competitive.
The leadership of IBM and Apple has been seriously undermined, barriers to
new entrants have dropped, and prices and margins have tumbled.
The economics and structure of the broadcasting, telecoms and computer
industries are thus changing fundamentally, and generally to the
disadvantage of carriers and broadcasters. In a much more competitive
marketplace, created largely by technological change, the cost of delivery
of programming and information relative to content will fall dramatically.
Some profess to have identified more opportunities than threats. The
multimedia services of the future, according to the new conventional wisdom,
will be on-line: movies-on-demand, home-shopping and banking, video games,
distance learning, and a galaxy of interactive facilities.
There are two flaws in this vision. The first is that it exaggerates the
value of on-line delivery - many interactive services are already being
satisfactorily implemented on off-line media such as CD-Rom.
Second, it confuses the question of competition between different
distribution systems with that of possible markets for new services.
Technology can change the basis of production, but it cannot by itself
create new markets. That depends primarily on the appeal of the accompanying
programming or software to a particular set of customers.
The main advantage of the intelligent TV for the average couch potato is
initially likely to be that it will make choosing from a bewildering array
of programming much easier. It will not seriously reduce demand for passive
viewing, nor will it endow network or cable operators with skills in
programme making, interactive or otherwise.
That is why it is fanciful to think of this as a single new industry. The
players in the complex new set of overlapping markets will have distinct
roles, which will be determined more by their capabilities than by their
assets. Success will come from applying those capabilities imaginatively,
and from competing and collaborating intelligently, not from acquiring
companies in unfamiliar businesses.
The beneficiaries of the new media order will be the publishers of
programming and software, particularly those that can redefine their
businesses in the way that Reuters and Microsoft, for example, have done.
The biggest challenges will face those that have been accustomed to
regulated markets and outright monopoly. Telephone and cable companies, when
the regulators permit, will be challenging each other not so much for the
new multimedia markets as for each other's core businesses.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Leading Article: A chiaroscuro election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing in Italian politics is ever quite what it seems. On the face of it,
yesterday's election result represents a decisive break with the past of
muddled and corrupt coalition governments as well as a stunning victory for
the right-wing Freedom Alliance spearheaded by media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi. In reality, it is neither so novel nor so decisive.
Although Mr Berlusconi posed as a harbinger of Italy's renewal, his business
career - involving close links with politicians now on trial for corruption
 -reflected much that was wrong with the way the country was run in recent
decades. While the electorate has clearly signalled its disgust with the old
order by plumping for a man who has been in politics barely four months, it
also confirmed a fact common to other democracies: that voters choose
politicians who tell them what they want to hear.
Even the Freedom Alliance's absolute majority in the lower house may turn
out on closer inspection to be fuzzier than it looks. The three parties of
which it is composed make such implausible bedfellows that it is hard to see
them forming a stable or durable government. Moreover, the tensions among
them - between the corporatist MSI/National Alliance and the economically
liberal Forza Italia, or between the federalist Northern League and the
centralist, southern-based MSI - do more to underline the problems facing
Italy than to identify common ground for solving them.
When a government is eventually formed, those problems will be as acute as
ever, and the options for addressing them every bit as constrained as those
that have guided the technocratic coalitions of the past two years.
A new prime minister will find no escape from the financial reality of a
budget deficit only just under control and a public sector debt still
climbing. Any deviation from the arduous course of fiscal adjustment charted
by the outgoing Ciampi government will be instantly punished in the bond
markets, with rapid effects on domestic interest rates and growth. The first
test will come almost as soon as the new government takes office, when it
considers, as it must, how to deal with a worrying overshoot on the deficit
revealed last week.
If that government's leader is Mr Berlusconi, he will find his task made no
easier by his election trail slogans of lower taxes. This pledge is not
compatible with Italy's current fiscal predicament. Now that power is almost
within his grasp, he needs to swallow it and concentrate on the stark choice
his country faces. On one side is the long, hard climb towards fiscal
respectability and integration with Europe; on the other, a slide towards
Latin American-style financial collapse. If a Prime Minister Berlusconi
chooses the former, he will be well placed eventually to deliver the
economic transformation he has promised, since his victory comes just as the
European economy is turning. If not, his political career will prove an
ephemeral phenomenon.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Ice cream wars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems largely oblivious to the
realities of Britain's membership of the European Union, to judge by
yesterday's report on the use of exclusive freezer cabinets to sell ice
cream. The report skates over the fact that EU competition authorities are
currently investigating the identical issue in Ireland. Nowhere does it hint
that the MMC considered conferring with Brussels before reaching its own
conclusions.
This is no minor oversight. The separate inquiries into ice cream
distribution clearly create the potential for a jurisdictional clash between
EU and national competition laws, and between the regulatory authorities
charged with administering them. There is no certainty that Brussels'
eventual decision and that of the MMC will concur. If they do not,
regulatory uncertainty will be in prospect. If they do, it will be due to
coincidence. That is no way to run a competition policy.
The MMC's insistence that it must consider the issues 'solely in the
circumstances of the UK market and in the context of domestic legislation',
while technically correct, is myopic. The fact is that when EU and national
law conflict the former prevails. Even if conflict is avoided this time, it
is increasingly likely to arise in future restrictive practices cases.
As markets grow more competitive and product lives shorten in most
industries, manufacturers everywhere are seeking advantage by tightening
control over marketing and distribution. That increasingly requires
competition authorities to define the line between legitimate commercial
strategy and anti-competitive behaviour. Simultaneously, the single market
is prompting more companies to supply all of Europe from fewer plants. As
the resulting flow of products across borders grows, more competition cases
will fall within EU law, which takes precedence when trade between member
states is in question.
Brussels is seeking to lighten its workload by encouraging national courts
to judge more cases on the basis of EU law. That seems a sensible aim, in
line with the broad principle of subsidiarity. But jurisidictional confusion
will only increase unless the domestic laws applied by national competition
authorities are also aligned with those of the EU. The longer the British
government delays doing so, the less seriously will be taken its
protestations that it wants effective competition policies and its
complaints about interference from Brussels.
The role of the MMC also needs to be re-thought. It has already surrendered
to the EU much of its authority over mergers. Recent trends point to a
similar decline in its monopolies workload. The government could usefully
ask whether the MMC's current resources are justified, and whether it should
not be co-ordinating more closely with Brussels, where power over
competition policy increasingly lies.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Zulu factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's nightmare came a step closer on Monday. In the past, the
country's political leaders have stepped back from the brink, but with an
election barely a month away tensions are rising.
The country's Transitional Executive Council, effectively South Africa's
ruling coalition between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress, is understandably tempted to take drastic action
to ensure stability. One option is to declare a state of emergency in Natal,
send in the security forces and effectively depose the man they hold
responsible for the crisis: Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of
KwaZulu homeland and leader of the predominantly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party.
Chief Buthelezi has decided to play the ethnic card, and it is a dangerous
one. Zulus are by no means a monolithic voting bloc and it is probable that
the ANC commands the allegiance of the majority of the electorate in Natal.
But deeper passions are at play: a sense of nationhood, a wounded pride, a
violent and belligerent past. Chief Buthelezi can readily exploit these
characteristics, creating a situation in which political preference takes
second place to blood loyalties.
It is not illegitimate to base a political party on such an appeal. Ethnic
loyalties remain a fundamental factor in African politics. The danger of
such appeals come when they cannot be accommodated by the country's
constitution. Chief Buthelezi is admittedly an infuriating negotiating
partner and, judging by his administration of KwaZulu as a de facto
one-party state, is not a democrat by nature.
Yet his power to damage South Africa is out of proportion to the number of
votes he can command. He cannot be allowed to exercise a veto over South
Africa's search for a stable democracy. But the constitutional options which
might lead to his participation in elections have not been exhausted. All
parties have already agreed to submit the problem to international
mediation. Little has been done, however, to put this agreement into effect.
Until this is done, the TEC should stay its hand. There may come a time, if
Chief Buthelezi refuses to co-operate, when government needs to intervene in
the interests of ensuring an orderly election in Natal as well as elsewhere.
But premature action could lead to disaster.
Such advice runs counter to the prevailing mood in a country where politics
has become a bloodsport conducted with as much subtlety as bear-baiting.
There are those in the ANC anticipating a once-and-for-all victory over an
adversary they loathe, taunting Chief Buthelezi with the threats of tanks in
Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital. They should be restrained. Hasty use of force
before all negotiating possibilities have been exhausted could play into
Chief Buthelezi's hands and give him a cause around which to mobilise
resistance for decades to come.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Governance which displays apathy and
inertia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   Mr TREVOR HARVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One has to question whether the chairman of the Building Societies
Association does his members a service by arguing for the status quo in
relation to the corporate governance of building societies (Letters, March
22).
He is, of course, correct in pointing to the need for members' approval for
the adoption of new powers and the part played by members in the election of
directors. The message your readers are meant to draw is that the current
system of building society governance is alive and well.
One wonders, what proportion of members vote, either for resolutions or
directors? Since the current legislation was introduced in 1986, how many
societies' boards have been constrained from operating any new powers
through their resolutions being rejected? How many directors nominated by
existing boards have been initially appointed since 1986? How many directors
nominated by members have been elected in that time?
The answers to such questions would provide perspective and add some factual
basis for the accountability debate. What they will point to is a system of
corporate governance which exhibits apathy and inertia among the vast
majority of members, with boards almost without exception getting their way.
Effectively, it is a corporate governance vacuum. And where a vacuum exists,
something will fill it.
The Building Societies Commission has already had one go at trying to apply
Cadbury's plc-based recommendations to building societies and is now
reconsidering the issue. The Treasury is currently considering building
society legislation as part of its deregulation initiative. In this regard,
some societies have welcomed proposals which would lead to even lower levels
of member participation.
Most members who have ever attended the typical building society AGM
couldn't tell the difference between its orchestrated proceedings and those
of a Tory party conference. If that is what is to pass as evidence of
effective accountability and good corporate governance in practice, some
people are easily pleased.
Trying to perpetuate an unadulterated system based on largely 19th century
ideals of mutual self-help is a delusion. Societies are running the risk
that the vacuum might be filled with something they will not like and surely
would not have designed for themselves.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Russia policy is vital: EU entry alone can guarantee eastern
Europeans' independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to imagine how the 12 governments of the European Union could
have wasted so much political energy over four miserable votes in the
Council of Ministers. This is supposed to be a Union of like-minded European
countries with common interests. Don't they realise the issue they should be
worrying about is developing a coherent policy towards Russia and its former
satellites? Apparently not.
Russia is the really big issue facing western Europe, and it demands a
European strategy. But Europeans are doing what they have done for 50 years:
hoping the Americans will take care of it.
Unfortunately, US policy towards Russia and its neighbours veers erratically
from one simple-minded nostrum to another. Not long ago, US policy was
committed wholly to friendship with Russia, to the neglect of its former
satellites. The peace of the world would hang on the reform of Russia at
home and its stability abroad - so that was where the US should invest its
energies.
Since the Russian elections last December, the wishful thinking behind this
policy has become apparent. Russian nationalists are on the rampage; leading
economic reformers have been forced out of government; and Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the previously pro-western foreign minister, has started echoing
the new rhetoric of nationalism. In recent days there have been two rumours
of coups threatening the Yeltsin regime.
Now the balance of the argument in Washington has swung right round: the
idealists and the advocates of friendship with Russia are under sharp attack
from the realists and the advocates of containment. Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski,
a former US national security adviser, has derided the pro-Russian policy as
'romantic', and has called on Washington to support Ukraine's independence,
so as to prevent a resurgence of Russian imperialism. Under assault for his
Russia-first policy, President Clinton has started paying more attention to
Russia's neighbours, beginning with invitations to the leaders of Ukraine,
Georgia and Kazakhstan.
This US antithesis between friendship and containment is too one-dimensional
to be much help in framing policy. In fact, it may not much matter what
America's policy is, because the US cannot really have much influence on
events in the east. Containment is not a real option, because neither
Congress nor the White House would be prepared to pay for it. American cold
war geo-strategists may imagine they can again contain the Soviet threat,
but they are playing anachronistic power games.
It is absurd to ask whether Russia is a friend or an enemy; the Russians
themselves may not know what they are because they are at the epicentre of a
vortex, an earthquake, a field of force. But unless or until it breaks up
into a collection of tiny bits, Russia will be an enormous geopolitical mass
exerting enormous gravitational force on its surroundings. Any piffling
Western attempt to deny, merely by force of moral indignation, this Russian
sphere of influence is doomed pitifully to fail.
We do not like the way Moscow destabilised 'independent' Georgia and Belarus
back into the Russian orbit; but did we do anything about it? No. Will we do
anything to protect the independence of Ukraine? No. Or the Baltic states?
Be serious. It may prove impossible to challenge Russia inside the borders
of the former Soviet Union at an acceptable risk to our interests.
The only place we can hope to counteract the gravitational pull of Russia is
in eastern Europe; and the only way we can do it is to extend our own sphere
of influence. In practice, the Russians may not want to take back their
eastern European empire piecemeal. But if we want to prevent the danger, we
must extend our western empire into the east. The 'we' in this context is
western Europe, it is not America, and it is not Nato. The US has already
made clear it will not extend its security guarantee beyond the existing
borders of western Europe. So if we want to guarantee the independence of
the eastern Europeans, we can only do it by bringing them into the European
Union.
Ah, you will say, but we are already committed to the principle of admitting
them: the 12 said so at their Copenhagen summit last June. Any day now the
Poles and the Hungarians will deliver formal requests for membership. And
the German government has said it will be pressing hard to open up the Union
to the east Europeans, starting during its presidency of the Council in the
second half of this year.
But this extension eastwards cannot be politically neutral. The expansion of
the European Union may be less threatening to the Russians than the
expansion of Nato. But it is still a challenge to the Russian sphere of
influence through an expansion of the western sphere of influence; and it
will require the mustering of a European foreign policy towards Russia and
its neighbours, not as an episodic, optional, rhetorical extra, as in the
Maastricht treaty, but as an unavoidable, operational, federal necessity.
The voting argument has distracted attention from the more important fact,
that we are moving into a qualitatively new phase in the integration of
Europe. Enlargement to the east means that we shall have come to the end of
the step-by-step process launched by Jean Monnet. Instead, the member states
will have explicitly to commit themselves to the principle and the practice
of a truly European foreign policy; they will, for the first time, have to
define the final state of the European Union; and they will have to rethink
its constitutional arrangements from the ground up.

Sir, I can't help but reflect that some purveyors of new technology get a
little lost in their own cleverness. A recent advertisement for a mobile
phone suggests we should prepare to be amazed '. . . you can actually answer
the phone with your voice'.
While not particularly amazed, perhaps your readers, like myself, can be
comforted that our method of using the telephone, as established by Eddison
all those decades ago, can continue, despite the heady pace of the
telecommunications revolution.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Out of town, out of favour: UK guidelines on shopping
centres are causing confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has 19 car parks with space for 10,000 cars, shops covering the area of
20 football pitches, and an annual turnover of Pounds 300m. A high-tech
monorail whisks people between the glass-vaulted shopping centre and the
retail 'sheds' surrounding it.
Merry Hill in the West Midlands is typical of the large out-of-town shopping
centres that sprang up in the 1980s. It has devastated the retail trade of
nearby Dudley. A government-sponsored survey last year found Dudley town
centre had lost 70 per cent of its trade since Merry Hill was completed in
1989, and 11 other town centres had suffered at least limited impact.
Merry Hill is not an isolated example of such a development in the UK. Five
shopping centres of a similar size, together with 28m sq ft of superstores
and retail sheds, have been built since 1980, in a swing to edge-of-town and
out-of-town retailing that has changed the UK landscape. In that time,
out-of-town retailing's share of retail sales has risen from 5 per cent to
25 per cent.
This trend has shown little sign of abating. For the first time, out-of-town
shopping centre space proposed by developers - at 7m sq ft  - now exceeds
that proposed for town centres, according to chartered surveyors Hillier
Parker.
But much of that may not be built. In two sets of planning guidelines for
local authorities and a series of speeches, environment secretary Mr John
Gummer has signalled tougher restrictions on 'sheds on the by-passes'. He
says he wants to revive and rebuild the UK's decaying town centres.
That could have important implications for retailers, many of which have
strategies concentrating on out-of-town expansion, and the construction
industry, for which continuing retail development has been one of the few
lifelines during the recession.
Mr Gummer's philosophy is simple: 'I want to see us improve the quality of
our towns so that we can reduce pressures of urban sprawl and the
development of green-field sites,' he told the Town and Country Planning
Association in January. Out-of-town development 'echoes the drive-in
philosophy we see across the Atlantic, where people mourn the loss of Main
Street'.
Yet there remains widespread confusion among retailers, developers and local
authorities about the Department of the Environment's real aims. The British
Property Federation, a body representing landlords, says Mr Gummer's recent
statements run counter to the government's attempts to introduce greater
certainty into the planning process.
The reason for this confusion is the difference in tone between the
government's guidance notes, which are designed to direct local authorities
in making planning decisions, and Mr Gummer's speeches.
Retail planning guidelines - PPG6 - published last July were relatively
mild. They called for 'a suitable balance in providing for retail
development between town centre and out-of-centre retail facilities'.
Developments should be vetoed only if there was 'clear evidence to suggest
that the result would be to undermine the vitality and viability of (the)
town centre'.
The second set of guidelines, PPG13, published this month dealt mainly with
transport policy, and the need to reduce car journeys and encourage
alternative means of travel. Only two of the 132 paragraphs specifically
covered retailing, and they suggested the July note gave definitive
guidance.
Nevertheless, Mr Gummer has repeatedly emphasised his determination to bring
lasting changes to the UK's retailing and urban landscape, often going
beyond PPG6. He has promised a series of initiatives on improving town
centres, and told the Town and Country Planning Association that he had
asked the DoE to alert him personally to any developments threatening urban
centres. If the July guidance was not effective, he suggested, 'I will have
to consider whether a revision to that guidance is necessary'.
As if to demonstrate his resolve, Mr Gummer recently vetoed two out-of-town
projects - a shopping centre at Duxford, and an edge-of-town supermarket at
Ludlow, Shropshire - although several other developments have been approved
without problems. How strong his commitment is to curtailing out-of-town
development may become clearer through the outcome of forthcoming planning
appeals.
But retailers and developers believe they can deploy strong arguments to
persuade him to soften his position. They may get their chance through the
Commons environment select committee, which begins an inquiry next month
into shopping centres and retail development.
One argument likely to be presented is that the swing to out-of-town
shopping has not been a whim of shops and property companies, but a response
to customer demand - which will not evaporate. 'A policy that does not
recognise commercial realities is not sustainable,' says Mr John Bullough of
Grosvenor Estates, which spent five years on proposals for the Duxford
scheme rejected by Mr Gummer.
Ending out-of-town development will not in itself stop the deterioration of
town centres, say Mr Gummer's critics. 'We cannot turn the clock back,' says
Mr Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
'If retail parks on the edge of particular towns are denied permission, then
the customer will simply drive to an adjoining town and take away business
from the first under-supplied town.'
Retailers such as Boots and Marks and Spencer, moreover, argue that, in
addition to developing out-of-town sites, they have helped fund town centre
management schemes, in which the local authority appoints a manager to
promote the centre. In Oxford and Liverpool, for instance, Marks and Spencer
have seconded store managers to such posts, and is spending Pounds  1/2 m a
year on town-centre projects.
Revitalising town centres needs investment, but often it has taken the
development of a competing out-of-town retail centre to spur authorities
into taking action, says Mr Geoffrey Smith, managing director of planning
consultants Nathaniel Lichfield &amp; Partners.
Retailers may also argue that out-of-town retailing can be more
environmentally friendly than town-centre shopping. One trip a week - or
less - to an edge-of-town superstore may involve a customer driving fewer
miles than several trips to a local supermarket would.
Taking account of the force of these arguments, and after scrutinising the
government's guidelines, the consensus among planning experts is that the
impact of Mr Gummer's initiative may be less than some observers have
predicted.
They say the Department of Environment is likely to end further development
of large retail shopping centres such as Merry Hill, or Lakeside in Essex,
as they can be shown to have a damaging effect on nearby town centres. But
Bluewater Park, a proposed Pounds 300m scheme at Dartford, and Trafford
Park, a Pounds 200m development near Manchester, may squeeze through.
Bluewater is seeking a funding partner; Trafford Park's fight for planning
permission goes to the Court of Appeal on May 16.
Observers also suggest that getting permission may become more difficult for
smaller shopping centres and groups of stores in retail parks: extending
existing out-of-town developments is likely to be easier than building new
ones. Superstores and warehouses selling groceries and bulky goods, however,
are less likely to be affected, as good reasons can be given for siting
these next to car parks, out of town.
Another consequence could be that retailers and developers are pushed
towards reclaiming derelict land, where the potential benefits would make it
difficult for local authorities to refuse planning permission.
But even if the pace of out-of-town retail development slows for a few
years, planning experts believe the rise of the retail shed and the
green-field mall is not over for ever.
'My view is that planning policy revolves rather than evolves,' Mr Smith, of
Nathaniel Lichfield, told a Retail Week conference last week. 'The pendulum
is clearly swinging towards town centres, but it will swing back towards
out-of-town in five years.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: In-depth study would show a different
picture of Jersey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms IMOGEN NICHOLLS and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your survey on Jersey (March 22) was far from being an in-depth study
into the current state of the island.
Its principal weakness lies in its focus on the same old faces that have
dominated the scene for much of the past 30 years. Their version of reality
paints a glossy picture of financial probity, political stability and a
general state of well-being that contrasts with the rest of the world. In
this respect, the text mirrored the photographs, carefully contrived to
avoid reference to the unpleasant side-effects of uninhibited growth such as
over-population; pollution stemming from rising volumes of domestic waste
and an over-intensive agricultural system; ugly architecture which has
greatly diminished our heritage; price inflation; the complete absence of
consumer or labour protection; and the subversion of the democratic ideal.
As newly elected politicians, we are greatly concerned that the Bailiff, an
unelected Crown Officer, should use the FT survey to criticise the recent
measure to provide politicians with a very modest allowance to cover their
living costs. We have no doubt that it suited the Bailiff, and many like
him, to have in place a system which precluded the vast majority of
islanders from standing for office.
For decades the States of Jersey has been dominated by land owning and small
business interests. Old-boyism and incompetence have been rife. At the 1993
elections, the voters opted for a new breed of radical politicians committed
to an agenda of social reform and environmental protection. These voices
have, by and large, been ignored by an intentionally anti-democratic power
structure.
Confronted by an electorate that is hungry for change, the old guard is
fighting back by refusing to share out power through the committee system of
government, and by clogging up the law-drafting process with legislation
catering to the needs of international finance capital. The message is loud
and clear: we can do anything we like as long as we do not interfere with
the status quo. So much for democracy.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dual voting system has harmful
repercussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STUART BELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As demonstrated at last Friday's Lonrho annual meeting, even the most
tin-pot dictator would be hard-pressed to come up with a voting system as
undemocratic as that used by most UK companies. Using the present system,
the board can choose to accept the vote at the meeting (taken on the basis
of one vote per member) or to invoke the dead-weight of institutional
proxies to win the vote on the basis of one vote per share.
The dual voting system is a recipe for confusion and disillusion with the
corporate governance process. It both disenfranchises small shareholders who
know that institutional proxy votes can almost always outvote them on a
poll, and dissuades institutions from exercising their votes in an informed
manner independent of the board, since they know their proxy votes will
remain undisclosed and unused except in the rare instances when a poll is
called.
In our view, the system needs to be rationalised so that one vote per share
is the norm, as in the US. While this would favour institutions, the
counting and disclosure of proxy votes should encourage them to develop -
and publish - voting policies, as the Cadbury committee recommended. With a
clearer responsibility for voting, institutional investors would devote
greater efforts to scrutinising the board's proposals rather than acting as
a rubber-stamp as is too often the case at present.
If voting on a show of hands were abolished, small shareholders would lose
some influence, but in practice their voting rights are already minimal,
given the spectre of polls which can be called at the chairman's discretion.
They could anyway still attend AGMs and question directors.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Time to swat the fly on the wall - Christopher Dunkley
seeks a change of direction in TV documentaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time the phrase 'fly-on-the-wall documentary' was banished. You can
live for weeks with a fly on the wall and not notice it, but having a film
crew in the kitchen is like living with an elephant; you cannot ignore it.
Far from being inconspicuous, the camera crew, even with modern lightweight
equipment, becomes the focus of activity wherever it goes.
It is nearly 40 years since Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Tony
Richardson started the documentary movement known as 'free cinema', and more
than 20 years since Roger Graef, in making The Space Between Words for BBC2,
made cameraman Charles Stewart shoot countless empty magazines before
loading film, in order to make the presence of the crew in home, factory and
so on seem so familiar as to be forgotten.
Then came The Family, Paul Watson's 'elephant-on-the-floor' series about the
Wilkins of Reading and, more recently, Watson's reprise, this time in
Australia, with the astounding Noelene in Sylvania Waters.
The latest example is The Living Soap, a weekly BBC2 series which started
last October and documents the lives of six students sharing a house in
Manchester. There have been 20 episodes, but now the series is being
virtually abandoned. There are plans for just two future documentaries in a
more conventional style to round things off. The series was promoted as a
'fly-on-the-wall soap-umentary' and it was the topical and continuing nature
of the production which caused difficulties. Where most series are shot in
their entirety, edited and then screened, The Living Soap was shooting and
screening as life continued, and the outside world began to intrude.
Stones were thrown through the window of one of the black students. A story
about the sex life of one of the girls was sold to The Sun. Those living in
the house found themselves suddenly famous, unable to go to the pub or a
lecture without being pestered by their viewers. The strain began to tell
and, unsurprisingly, half the students walked out.
It is hard to avoid the feeling that the hybrid techniques being used to
film were hindering rather than helping. Sometimes the camera behaved as a
supposedly discreet onlooker, but at other times the students directly
addressed the camera crew. Even more riskily, one room had a robot camera
which the students could use to go behind one another's backs to explain or
complain.
But that is incidental. The important point is that although the
fly-on-the-wall technique is presented to us as a means of getting at the
truth about the way the subjects of a programme live, its true significance
is as a means of getting the programme makers into the lives of the
subjects.
If your object is the most honest and accurate portrayal of life, you would
almost certainly get closest to this by moving in for six months with those
concerned and then writing a drama. But imagine Paul Watson telling Noelene,
'I'd like to come and live with you for six months then write a play about
you'. It has none of the seductive power of 'Can I bring in a camera crew to
film everything you do?'
BBC1 recently screened Torvill and Dean: Facing the Music, a documentary
presumably intended to capitalise on Olympic gold and set the scene for the
World Championships. As we know, T &amp; D won bronze and decided to abandon
their revived 'amateur' career. Yet that scarcely weakened the appeal. Here
was a programme which never pretended to be anything but a contrived
artefact, which is as it should be since it was made by one of Britain's
best documentary producers Edward Mirzoeff.
The script was important, the music counted, the distance of the camera from
the subject was sometimes critical and, above all, the entire package was
edited with tremendous care. The juxtaposition of sequences was often
crucial.
Mirzoeff's own perceptions and sensibilities were clearly involved. The
cutting between partner and spouse, the way in which the now celebrated
training session was shot, with Dean's heavy handedness producing Torvill's
tears, was carefully thought out. In the sense that it was so calculatedly
crafted this was half way towards the condition of a drama: no one was
pretending here that the footage was untouched by human mind.
It is conceivable that further truths might have been brought out by going
the whole hog and creating an actual drama ('Art is a lie that tells us the
truth,' said Picasso), but then you would have lost the authenticity and
impact that come from the real people. It is difficult to foresee a time
when there will be a satisfactory substitute for this sort of classic
documentary.
That said, the improvement in picture and sound quality available from
camcorders - and their shrinking cost - has led to a new form of television
exemplified excellently by Video Nation. Produced by the BBC's 'access'
outfit, the Community Programme Unit, they have given cameras to 55 widely
assorted people in Britain who are recording aspects of their own lives. So
far we have seen a compilation called Money Money Money in which the
participants all covered that subject, and a sequence of much briefer clips
involving a variety of topics.
It might be thought that by cutting out the professional camera crew you
must get closer to the truth, and taking these contributions individually it
seems almost certain that you do, though people are capable of lying even to
themselves of course. But Money Money Money vividly illustrated the fact
that editing can be far more important than any individual contribution.
The general impression left by this programme was not of a country now
preponderantly middle class, with more people better off than ever before,
but of contrasting extremes, with the emphasis on the unemployed and the
poor. Nothing much wrong with that, but it does highlight an important
truth: that the intention of the programme maker is 10 times more
significant the technique.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Fumbles in the Thirties - Towards the Millennium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plunging on Towards the Millennium, the South Bank's bold survey of our
musical century, encapsulated decade by decade in annual series until the
year 2000, is now deep into the 1930s (Anxiety and Escapism).
In this kind of exercise, hindsight is everything: the spring season in
AD2000 will be guesswork, for somebody must identify the crucial works of
the 1990s at rather short notice. Even the music of the 1930s still resists
confident, God's-ear assessment.
When Simon Rattle and the CBSO played Stravinsky's melodrame Persephone
(1933) and Walton's Belshazzar's Feast (1931) on Friday, were they
presenting major works of the decade, or just Notable Misfires by Major
Composers? The performances made a strong case for the latter reading.
The composer of Persephone was never happy with it. He had loathed Andre
Gide's woozily elevated text - 'vers de caramel', he called it - and set it
with a cool disregard for natural accents and scansion. Having heard a
single run-through, Gide fled. Later, Stravinsky maintained that the
proportions of his score had been geared to precise stage requirements
(originally realised by the great Jacques Copeau), and were simply inapt for
concert performance. Stravinskians nevertheless detect a rare vein of vernal
innocence in this music, luminous enough to shine through its fusty format.
In this performance we hardly felt it.
Rattle's general conception rang true, with the heroine (Ida Rubinstein's
role) spoken by Claude Mathieu in faultless style. But the French diction of
his multiple chorus - the CBSO's own and the LSO's, with junior choristers
from Abbots Bromley, Tewkesbury and Lichfield Cathedral - was inarticulate
and bland, too vague to enliven the rhythms and too smooth to let in
much-needed fresh air.
As the priest-narrator Eumolpus, Nigel Robson was admirably musical and
sensitive, without making us forget that he was replacing another tenor
whose brighter, sweeter timbre might have been a decisive asset.
The net result was beta-blocker plain and pallid. It sounded the more so in
retrospect, perhaps, since Walton's nervy, flashily 'barbaric' cantata
followed hard on its heels. In fact, Belshazzar seemed long past its sell-by
date, though provincial choruses still aspire to meet its raucous demands.
It was no help that Rattle, who hates conventional bombast, took it so
swiftly and brittly. Professionally fervid bombast is what it needs; he
managed too little of that to conceal the holes between Walton's crafty
effects.
What we had instead was flatulent rhetoric without lyrical force, tiny
modernisms stuck on to safe harmonies, and emptily florid baritone solos
needing something more than Stephen Richardson's decently solid delivery.
Can't we just admit that this commission caught Walton on the wrong foot,
and did him no favour beyond transient success? So far as British music went
in the 1930s - not very far - any firm influence from Belshazzar would have
been reactionary, even downright pernicious.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Rich with contrasts - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time, I am in love.' Helen Mirren, playing Natalia Petrovna,
wife and mother caught between youth and middle age, is alone onstage. She
has fallen for Beliaev, her son's tutor, and she speaks these lines in a
daze of wondering gratitude, and through a mist of tears. In the next second
she turns brisk, her voice hardens, she adds 'He's got to go' - and the
whole theatre bursts into laughter.
With this split-second change of tone Mirren catches the self-contradictory
essence of Natalia Petrovna, the heroine of Turgenev's only play; and in
this extended scene alone, full of such sudden contrasts, she shows many
more facets of this one woman. Amid a comedy of conflicting desires, Natalia
is forever dramatising herself. This makes her both touching and absurd. And
yet, like a Marivaux heroine, she also manipulates the lives of people in
her power, more or less heartlessly. Mirren shows all this, and with
absolutely no grande dame airs or bids for our sympathy.
Wonderful to have Mirren in the West End again, and to watch her in a role
worthy of her calibre. (Her only serious miscalculation is a dragged-out
final exit, and a light dismissal of her long-trusted admirer Rakitin that
is even lighter than Turgenev can have intended.) The great risk she takes
is to emphasise Natalia's self-dramatising capriciousness even more than her
sincerity. We believe that she has fallen for young Beliaev; but not always.
When she says 'He's a real man,' we laugh; but we do not believe that she
means it so much as the dramatic scene she is acting in her own head. In her
big Act IV scene with him, she exposes her heart to him with beautiful
simplicity, tells him to go - and then says 'Well, why aren't you going?' so
sharply that we wonder how artless the previous speech really was. In short,
we never quite know this Natalia; and that is her fascination.
It is her fascination in particular for Rakitin, who is splendidly played by
John Hurt. His lined face, practising hard to play WH Auden, is too old for
the role (30 years of age, says Turgenev) but his spirit is Rakitin's to
perfection. He watches Natalia rush off in Act II, and exclaims 'What
vivacity]' so coolly that it sums up his impotent, sardonic character in a
trice. Finally in Act V he warns Beliaev of the perils of total love, of
'how much torrid hatred lies behind love . . . and what it means to belong
to a skirt'. Eighteen years ago in the same theatre, this speech was a
high-water mark of Derek Jacobi's art. Jacobi spoke it with scorching
bitterness; Hurt brings to it a vehemence that becomes so violent and
red-faced that - very strikingly - he has to stop. He is suddenly
embarrassed, and shrugs off his tirade as if it had no meaning.
For Turgenev, Rakitin was something of a self-portrait for Turgenev; and the
character's relationship with Natalia is something of a preparation for
Trigorin and Arkadina in Chekhov's The Seagull.
The director is Bill Bryden. He shows how Russian A Month in the Country is
in the way its wealth of detail brings a whole milieu to life: the
mother-in-law's painful feet, the companion who takes snuff, the nonsense
words coined by the rich, dull, old neighbour. It is Shpigelsky, the doctor,
who epitomises all this darling trivia, and who observes Natalia's household
cannily. John Standing brings this role an ideal quality of wry relaxation;
then suddenly at the end adds an astonishing dash of bitter Russian ennui.
Polly Adams, as his no longer young intended, performs with wit - and with
rather more charm than this frowsty spinster warrants.
Joseph Fiennes brings the youthful, bashful, handsome Beliaev utterly to
life; and as Vera - Natalia's ward, who also falls for him - Anna Livia Ryan
catches very keenly the heartbreak and hardness of adolescence, and its
rapid fluctuations between childishness and adulthood. As Natalia's husband
Gawn Grainger misfires on several counts - too sensitive a type to be so
blind to Natalia's real feelings, too urbane to be so thunderstruck. The
production does not consistently catch Turgenev's beating heart, but it is
fully alive to his endless ironies and touching surprises.
At the Albery Theatre, WC2.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: New York Met's Otello - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Met production of Otello will not seem so very new to anyone
familiar with Covent Garden's present staging. Once the company had decided
to abandon a projected version by John Schlesinger, on the grounds that
William Dudley's set would have been too complex for repertory exposure, it
went to the Royal Opera team of Elijah Moshinsky as director and Michael
Yeargan as set designer.
The result, while not quite a remake of the London production, has many of
the same features, including especially the feel of Venetian painting:
immense neoclassical columns that make the stage look like one of
Carpaccio's spacious vistas, and a Titianesque sumptuousness of colour and
texture in the costumes (by Peter J. Hall). When the Venetian ambassadors
arrive, they do so as a strong forward wave of crimson brocade and fur,
shamelessly spectacular.
Shamelessness and spectacle carry the weight of the production elsewhere
too. Mr Moshinsky's handling of the crowd scenes is extravagantly busy and
brilliantly managed: the slicing apart of the curtains at the beginning
reveals a proscenium at once filled with activity in an exhilarating
chiaroscuro, going up to a top level of soldiers and cannons.
Quite what kind of structure is being represented here is unclear, just as
the architectural purpose of the grand columns is never fully explicit. The
function of the sets is not to portray a city but to provide sufficient
space and splendour for action, or contrariwise for the effective stillness,
emptiness and isolation of the more intimate scenes. Otello and Desdemona
are often pinned against the base of one or other of the pillars; the
lighting examines them mercilessly. Only Iago has the freedom to wander and
lean.
The reason for this production was to salute Placido Domingo on the silver
anniversary of his first Met appearance, and his performance in the title
role is all the more fascinating for its edge of frustration. The ring of
brightness which we hear, for instance, at his first appearance does not
come easily to him now - it has to be striven for.
In his solo after the eavesdropping scene he gives up the striving, and the
voice becomes bleak, grim, heavily baritonal: the raw grain of the wood,
without the polish. At other points the sense of strain can be either
intense or exquisitely uncomfortable, but always it is just to the
expressive moment.
The command holds, magnificently. And if we begin to notice the cost, it is
not as vocal deficiency but as the cost exacted by the score on the wretched
victim it makes its chief character.
It also suits the piece that the Iago, Sergei Leiferkus, should be
effortlessly in control of his vocal equipment. His gentlemanly correctness
begins by seeming perhaps even too finely modulated: evil, one may feel,
ought to spit more, be more scarred. But this Iago is not evil, except in
being the supreme manager. What delights him is regulation, efficiency, the
ability to manipulate scenes and emotions. The 'Credo', in which Mr
Leiferkus does bare his tone and show us some vocal fangs, seems an act.
Carol Vaness's Desdemona is a less natural piece of casting. She is a
mettlesome stage personality, and here she gives the appearance of a
precarious restraint: left to herself she would surely be clouting Otello
back. Nor is it just a matter of physical behaviour, for there is an evident
carefulness too in her singing. She can produce beautiful sequences of
rounded, gleaming melody in the middle-high register, soft and yet carrying;
but the notes have to be held in place and warily balanced. It is a near
miracle that they almost always are so, but one cannot quite believe in the
purity, and without purity Desdemona has little going for her.
The other parts are paltry in this cruel opera, and they are adequately
done.
The conducting, on the other hand, is far more than adequate. Valery
Gergiev, normally associated with Russian repertory, proves he can be just
as passionate about Verdi, and there are moments, notably the close of the
third act, when the passion he encourages in the orchestra threatens to
drown out even a stage full of voices. And so the orchestra, in its display,
equals what we see on stage.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Extra space will be boon to Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Festival Theatre in Edinburgh will make a welcome impact on the
city's international arts festival this year, writes Martin Hoyle.
The new space will make it possible to present two blockbusters: the return
of the Mark Morris Dance Group in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, to
Handel's music, and the British debut of theatre director Luc Bondy. His
production of Peter Handke's The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other imports
skateboarders, rollerskaters, Tarzan and Moses from Berlin.
Mr Brian McMaster, director of the 1994 festival, said yesterday that the
new theatre will ensure that 'there are better facilities in Edinburgh than
at any other festival in the world.' This year's festival is budgeted at
Pounds 4.8m, Pounds 600,000 up on last year.
While the festival dance programme is 'one of the biggest ever' there is
evidence of more balance between rival art forms than in recent years.
Theatre also includes a new Robert Lepage project at Meadowbank Sports
Centre (last year's unexpectedly successful last-minute dance venue). The
Seven Streams of the River Ota launches an enterprise scheduled to take two
to three years, dealing with the impact on the world of the bombing of
Hiroshima. Murrayfield Ice Rink is pressed into service for Aeschylus'
Oresteia in a production from Moscow by Peter Stein.
Of the opera performances, the most exciting may be The Australian Opera's
version of Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream, produced by Baz Luhrmann, the
young director of the film Strictly Ballroom, and already rapturously
received on its home territory. But the Festival Theatre is baptised
appropriately by Scottish Opera on 15 August with Fidelio. Beethoven
provides one of the musical themes this year, together with Chabrier, whose
Etoile is accompanied by a new production from Opera North of Le Roi Malgre
Lui.
Beethoven's nine symphonies and five piano concertos will field such
performers as Andras Schiff, Richard Goode, Frans Bruggen, Alfred Brendel
and Bernard Haitink.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Sewage in the supermarket / A
look at Wessex Water's plans to market freeze-dried human waste as soil
fertiliser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlikely though it may seem, a combination of European Union regulations and
green consumerism could result in freeze-dried sewage sludge for sale in
supermarkets.
This product idea, based on converting human waste into soil fertiliser, is
a result of the response of Wessex Water, one of Britain's privatised water
companies, to the EU's 1991 urban waste water directive banning dumping of
sewage sludge at sea by the end of 1998.
A third of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in Britain was dumped at
sea in 1991; last year, 22 per cent was disposed of in this way.
The directive also demands an increased number of sewage treatment works to
cover coastal towns by 2006. The amount of sludge produced by the treatment
process is expected to double as a result.
The water industry has been forced to develop a number of processes - some
more traditional than others - to deal with the sludge in a way which is
environmentally acceptable and cost-effective. Clive Coombes, a process
scientist with WS Atkins, the UK engineering consultants, wrote in Water
Bulletin, a trade journal, last year: 'Sludge treatment to produce materials
that can be marketed at a profit is something of a Holy Grail for the water
industry.'
Richard Lacey, Wessex Water's divisional manager for waste water, says:
'This is a problem for the whole of the UK water industry. Millions of
pounds are being spent doing something about it.'
Almost half of the UK's sewage sludge is now used to fertilise agricultural
land. Liquid sludge is rich in phosphates and nitrogen. But it has a number
of inherent disadvantages; chief among these are smell, a content that
includes heavy metals and the ability to pollute water courses. It is also,
in its bulky wet form, expensive to transport.
Wessex Water ended 25 years of dumping Bristol's sludge into the sea when it
built a Pounds 7.5m biodrier 18 months ago. The Swiss-built equipment, four
times larger than any other in Europe and the only one on mainland Britain,
dries, pasteurises and sieves the fermenting sludge into odourless,
even-sized granules of one-twentieth the volume.
The drying gases used in the process are recycled, as is 70 per cent of the
heat used. Methane gas is produced by heating the fermenting sludge. The
surplus energy created from this is sold to the national grid under the
non-fossil fuel obligation, earning Wessex Water an estimated Pounds 1m a
year.
The biodrier now produces between 30 and 40 tonnes of granules a day from 45
per cent of all Wessex Water's liquid sludge. The process means the end
product is easy to transport. The company has reduced its lorry loads of
sludge per year from 150,000 pre-biodrier to 100,000.
Most of Biogran, the name of the granules, is sold for use on agricultural
land, but purchasers also include the Forestry Commission, British Coal (for
use on land reclamation sites) and golf courses. In one of Wessex Water's
promotional pictures, a group of golfers happily putt away while sludge is
spread on the course.
At a cost of approximately Pounds 100 per tonne of Biogran, Wessex Water
intends to make a good return on its initial investment. To help it do so,
the company aims to branch out into the horticultural and domestic markets.
It is holding talks with the Department of the Environment and the European
Commission to redesignate the product as suitable for these markets.
Biogran's use is currently controlled, along with other sludge products, by
the UK department's sewage to agricultural land regulations.
According to Lacey, the biodrier process changes the nature of the sludge
'beyond all recognition'. Samples are currently being tested in Brussels,
and Lacey says he hopes for a decision on the redesignation by the summer.
The company even plans to apply for an ecolabel, a badge of environmental
approval for supermarket-type goods awarded by the UK ecolabelling board and
replicated throughout the EU.
'We feel that we've entered the easier markets, so to speak, and have been
successful. Now we want a chance to enter the harder horticultural and
domestic markets,' says Lacey.
So far, Wessex Water has built only one other biodrier for a water authority
in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands. Other water companies have developed
different methods to meet the EU directive.
Environment department estimates suggest that incineration will increase by
the largest percentage after the sea option is no longer available. Thames
Water awarded contracts valued at Pounds 125m last month for two
incinerators to deal with the 4m tonnes of sludge being disposed of in the
North Sea. The company said that deployment of the sludge to agricultural
land was limited because of the lack of available land within the Thames
region.
At Anglian Water, trials involving composting the sludge with other
biodegradable materials such as vegetable or 'green' waste are taking place.
Peter Matthews, director of water services at Anglian, is an adviser to the
Japanese sewage works association. He says that while technology there -
able to convert sludge into material suitable for jewellery - is impressive,
it is suitable only for large conurbations such as Tokyo. The Japanese, he
says, are envious of the British capacity for sludge recycling on to the
land. 'In this country, we have very good opportunities for doing other
land-based things with sludge.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: An Indian tale of two extremes
 -Worldwide Waste / Big businesses are improving pollution control but small
concerns remain far behind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The effluent from the Shriram chemical works on the outskirts of Delhi is so
clean that samples are routinely passed through a fish tank. In seven years
the plant has not killed a single goldfish and officials boast the waste is
so pure they could drink it.
A few miles from Shriram stand the smoky workshops of about 20 dyers, full
of steaming vats of colours and bleaches. The untreated wastes are poured
straight into a ditch. Sultan Ahmed, who inherited his workshop from his
father, says he never checks his waste. Nor have his neighbours ever
complained.
The Shriram works and Ahmed's workshop are the two extremes of the
management of industrial waste in India. Shriram Foods and Fertiliser
Industries, controlled by a Delhi-based diversified group, is a model plant
producing vegetable oils, caustic soda and chlorine. It was turned into a
showpiece for the rest of Indian industry after a sulphuric acid leak in
1985 in which 500 people were injured. Today, it even has its own nature
reserve. Ahmed, meanwhile, is just one of millions of self-employed
craftsmen in India who have not heard of pollution control, know nothing of
the law on waste and have never seen an inspector.
Nobody knows how much industrial waste is poured into India's rivers. Data
at the government's Pollution Control Board (PCB) is fragmentary and often
out-of-date. The board's work mainly covers the country's large and
medium-sized factories - and barely touches the small workshops which
account for about one-third of India's manufacturing output. Moreover, even
large plants evade the law - some publicly-owned enterprises secure
protection from their ministries; some private companies pay bribes.
A common trick is to install pollution control equipment, but leave it
switched off because of power shortages, breakdowns or deliberate evasions
of the law. As Kapil Narula, a researcher at the Tata Energy Research
Institute, a private think-tank, says: 'With an average of only one
inspector for 50 factories, it is easy for a company to get away with
breaking the rules by paying money.'
Public awareness of the danger posed by some industrial wastes and materials
is low. In some parts of India, powdered DDT is still used instead of lime
to mark white lines on roads - because the deadly pesticide, banned in many
countries, is cheaper. D K Biswas, the PCB chairman, says: 'We have to
create greater awareness among workers and in the community.'
However, Indian pollution experts believe that standards of waste disposal -
as of airborne emissions - are gradually getting higher, particularly in the
large factories. In 1991, the PCB found that of 1,551 large plants with
potential pollution problems, only 112 had installed adequate control
equipment. By the end of last year, 1,119 of these factories had made the
grade and 77 had closed.
Newly-built plants are required to have international-standard pollution
control equipment. Foreign companies which might think of locating 'dirty'
industries in India would be wrong to believe they could save money on waste
and emission control systems. Even foreign companies obtaining goods from
Indian plants are obliged to take care. Indian environmental pressure groups
are quick to establish links between wrong-doings in India and a foreign
hand, however remote.
This awareness dates back to 1984 and the catastrophic gas leak in Bhopal,
central India. More than 3,000 people were killed and more than 50,000
seriously injured when deadly methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a pesticide
plant run by the Indian affiliate of Union Carbide, the US industrial group.
The accident forced the government to pass an Environmental Protection Act
in 1986 and make serious attempts at curbing pollution.
Large companies in pollution-prone activities - such as pesticides, textiles
and papermaking - have made progress in setting standards and installing
modern equipment. According to Biswas, the biggest remaining problems among
large companies are with distilleries, because of the organic waste flushed
into rivers, and with the smokestacks of fossil-fuel burning power stations.
Biswas admits that smaller companies are far behind in pollution control.
'Many small companies have no idea what to do,' he says. 'Their options are
to install equipment or to close. But very few have closed.'
In a celebrated case, the Supreme Court last year ended years of litigation
when it upheld the board's decision to force the closure of small metal
workshops surrounding the Taj Mahal to save the monument from airborne dirt.
But Biswas says that about 60 of the 212 workshops are still operating.
However, the widespread closure of small workshops in India is politically
almost impossible because it would make millions of people destitute. So,
the government is encouraging shared treatment plants in which clusters of
workshops can invest jointly in common equipment. But even these will prove
too expensive for many workshops.
Next week, Sweden.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Management: Prevention is key in tackling RSI / A look at a
TUC report on strategies for employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BUCKLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey last year by Britain's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) revealed
that there are almost 1m cases of musculoskeletal disorder in the UK, more
than 60 per cent of which were thought to have been caused by work.
Treatment is difficult once the condition becomes established, so prevention
is vital. The Trades Union Congress, the trade union movement's central
body, acknowledged this by commissioning the University of Surrey to prepare
a publication* on the subject, which will be launched in London today.
The publication says strategies should be aimed at those employees who are
experiencing minor aches and pains or muscle discomfort and at those who are
still trouble free.
To prevent the spread of Work Related Upper Limb Disorders, or Repetitive
Strain Injury (RSI) as it is popularly known, employers should be following
recent European directives and implementing UK regulations. Broadly speaking
there is a requirement to carry out sufficient workplace assessments; act on
the findings to reduce risks; involve employees throughout the process;
follow up any changes made.
The TUC publication identifies the three main areas in which employers can
act: through a consideration of the design of each job, assessment of the
needs of the worker and reviewing of policies for dealing with disorders.
The first implies a need to provide suitable equipment that fits the
multifarious shapes and size of a typical workforce. Without such an
objective some workers will find themselves working for long periods in
awkward postures. Not only might this increase the risk of a problem
developing, it is almost invariably less efficient with regard to work
output and quality. One suggestion is to consult the end users of equipment
before selecting new tools, furniture or technology, and purchase them after
trials with workers. Good workplace design allows the worker's joints to be
free from strain.
It is crucial that work is organised so that individuals are not at risk
from factors such as too many tight deadlines or work that is too physically
repetitive. To reduce this stress a culture of open communication between
managers, supervisors and staff is important.
Any individuals working on tasks judged to pose some risk should be rotated
to reduce the exposure time. Tasks that involve forceful or awkward
postures, high concentration and/or which are highly repetitive should have
inbuilt rest breaks to allow the worker to recover - regular breaks often
increase productivity and quality of work.
Stress may contribute to the problem and can be caused by factors including
workload, deadlines, control over work, and need to adapt to new technology.
When workers suffer from stress, this can show in physical symptoms, such as
tense postures. Low job satisfaction may also be the result of a job that
has not been designed to suit a worker's abilities. Consultation with
experts may be required to improve the content of such jobs.
If workers are required to work to a set rate, then this should be based on
realistic consideration of the job demands and individual worker
capabilities and not solely on the capacity of the machines. Bonus incentive
schemes, machine pacing or monitoring devices should not be used to
encourage workers to push themselves beyond their capacities. Good design
takes account of the fact that each individual has a different capacity.
The physical work environment can be a source of stress to workers.
Standards and guidelines are set out in recent HSE regulations, particularly
for display screen equipment users. Employees bear some responsibility for
their own health and safety but it is up to the employer to ensure that they
are not at risk from their work tasks or workplace environment.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Management: Steps to overseas experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most multinational companies want to give more of their managers
international experience. But they are finding it harder, more expensive -
and too slow - to do so by the conventional route: sending people to work
for several years as expatriates in distant subsidiaries.
Companies can resolve the problem by becoming more catholic in the way they
'internationalise' their executives, according to two business academics,
Brooklyn Derr and Gary Oddou. One method they suggest is to increase the
attractions of service abroad by moving more foreigners for limited periods
to the prime seat of corporate power.
Another method, which also speeds up the process, is to give middle or
senior managers experience of a region by sending them on three- to
six-month trips to several locations within it, especially any which have
been designated as business unit or divisional head offices.
A third more obvious approach, which is evidently growing, is to make
membership of international task forces a part of managerial training and
development. Philips, the electronics group, has done this for 20 years, say
the academics in an article in the latest issue of European Management
Journal*.
In spite of their awareness of the 'internationalisation' problem, many
multinationals - more than half according to one survey - have no strategy
for internationalising their managers.
Derr and Oddou in their own study of 105 European multinationals
found that almost three-quarters believed importing more foreign nationals
to corporate HQ was the key to their future internationalisation, while a
quarter said the 'import rate' would remain constant.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Management: Just in time now just too much - Japan's
plastics suppliers are leading a revolt against the much praised management
tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just in time, the Japanese management tool so widely admired and imitated
around the world, appears to be failing in its country of origin. Components
suppliers, straining under the worst recession since the second world war,
can no longer afford to deliver small regular batches to customers.
Just in time, it seems, has become just too much. Complaints from suppliers
about just in time have been voiced before in Japan and the US. But for the
first time some Japanese groups are beginning to take action to break down
the system.
The sector where the suppliers' revolt has taken greatest hold is the
plastics industry. Hiromasa Yonekura, director of basic chemicals at
Sumitomo Chemical, one of Japan's largest plastics manufacturers, explains:
'Japanese customers became almost tyrannical in their demands. We just had
to move away from just in time. It was just too expensive.'
The theory of just in time, developed during the 1960s by the now legendary
Taiichi Ohnowas, was that suppliers would make regular deliveries of small
batches so that the required parts were available at the required time in
the required amounts. This could cut inventories, reduce the need for
storage areas and eliminate double or triple handling. At its best,
inventory levels could fall by as much as 80 per cent in four months,
according to Kiyoshi Suzaki, author of a best-selling work* on techniques
for continuous improvement.
An additional benefit of this apparently rational system was that it shifted
the cost of work in progress from the manufacturer to the supplier, allowing
manufacturers to reduce the amount of cash tied up in inventory and so
improve their cash-flow. Conversely, suppliers had to build up stocks to
ensure they could provide the flexible deliveries required by customers.
During the 1980s, suppliers in the plastics industry tolerated the system
because it strengthened the relationship between them and the customer. Once
customers became used to a steady, dependable flow of materials from one
company they were unlikely to go elsewhere for their components. The costs
of additional freight and stock required for frequent small deliveries was
bearable because during much of the last decade the Japanese plastics
business was highly profitable. Demand outstripped supply, forcing up prices
and profits.
Those heady days have passed. Demand for ethylene, the basic building block
of plastics, has dropped 8 per cent over the past 12 months, while prices
have fallen every year for the past four years. Styrene monomer, used to
make polystyrene, has plunged from Y120 (76p) a kilo 2 1/2 years ago to only
Y60. Although raw material costs have fallen, most plastics manufacturers
are losing money. The 12 largest ethylene manufacturers are expected to
report combined losses during the financial year to March of Y51.6bn.
Given the falling demand in plastics over the past three years, the cost of
small, frequent deliveries has become insupportable. However, up until now
suppliers have been unable to end the practice.
The market clearly became a buyers' one, with supply exceeding demand. Any
attempt by one plastics maker to end the just in time deliveries often led
to loss of business.
The response of the plastics suppliers to this situation was typically
Japanese. Orchestrated by the petrochemicals industry association, they
recently decided to end just in time deliveries - all members were to stop
the practice simultaneously. The first product area to be targeted was
acrylics.
'Acrylic sheet was infamous for small deliveries, even within the plastics
industry,' says Yonekura. 'We were sometimes having to make deliveries three
times a day. The costs were exorbitant. Not only did you have to cover the
cost of freight, but you had to carry larger inventory too.' A further
problem was ensuring the materials arrived on time, given the traffic
congestion in Japan's big cities.
Manufacturers using acrylics were told deliveries would be limited to once a
day. Additional deliveries were available, but only if paid for by the
customer. 'If we're compensated for the additional freight costs, we're
prepared to do it. We're also charging extra for small deliveries, as well
as supplies on Saturday and Sundays,' explains Yonekura.
The acrylics buyers are also being encouraged to take larger quantities at
each delivery. 'For specialised materials we now require a minimum
quantity,' says Yonekura. The reaction of the acrylics buyers has not been
enthusiastic, but they have accepted it, he adds.
'I'm sure the new system will be extended to other plastics products,' says
Yonekura. 'The petrochemicals industry association is working out some sort
of agreement at the moment.'
Meanwhile, the plastics industry is being forced by the recession to
compromise another principle embedded during the 1980s - supplying products
that exactly meet customers' specifications.
Yonekura explains: 'It was ludicrous. We used to offer 400 different grades
of low density polyethylene and 400 different kinds of polypropylene. It's
all very well matching their customers' specifications, but because we were
producing such small batches, it raised our costs horribly. We've cut the
number of grades to 300 each and we're looking to reduce even for more.'
Similarly Mitsubishi Petrochemical used to make 600 grades of polypropylene
and polyethylene, but plans to reduce the number by 30 per cent.
Whether other sectors follow the example of the plastics industry remains
uncertain.
The petrochemicals companies involved are part of extremely powerful
organisations - known as keiretsu. These include industrial groups such as
Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Kawasaki which have the clout to impose
fundamental changes in logistical practices.
More traditional suppliers, often small family-owned businesses delivering
to large automotive or electronics groups, are less able to impose such
changes.

FT  30 MAR 94 / People: Sir Tom Cowie joins rival EMH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Tom Cowie, 71, who stepped down at the end of 1993 after 45 years as
chairman of the company he founded, seems intent on getting back into the
motor trade business. He's been recruited as a non-executive director of
European Motor Holdings where Roger Smith, 54, a past president of the
Retail Motor Industry Federation, has just been made chairman.
Sir Tom has never been one to collect non-executive directorships and he
says that he's limiting himself to EMH, where the chief executive is Richard
Palmer, 47. Palmer made his mark in the City by selling Western Motor
Holdings to Tozer Kemsley at a substantial profit in 1990 and he hopes EMH
will be equally successful.
In terms of market capitalisation, T. Cowie is eight times the size of EMH
but Sir Tom says that the board is 'young and ambitious and so am I'. Sir
Tom, who owns just under 5 per cent of Cowie and remains life president,
intends to buy a stake in EMH. He says that he's 'one of those strange
people who believe in putting their money where their mouth is'.
Roger Smith, who has taken over from Jeff Bizley, goes back a long way with
Sir Tom. He is a former chairman of Trimoco, which was taken over by
Hartwell, and an old grouse-shooting chum. Even so Sir Tom's decision to
join the EMH board has caused some puzzlement at his old firm. Sir Tom, for
his part, will not comment on rumours that he was unhappy with the way he
was gently edged out of power. All he will say is that 'it's nice to join a
happy camp'.
In the City, news of Sir Tom's new job has had a mixed reception. One
analyst says that Sir Tom built a large and very successful business but
towards the end he was 'spending more and more time on the grouse moors'.
And, he continues, it is 'an absolute travesty' to suggest that Sir Tom
posed any threat to his old firm.

London Clubs International, the casino group, has stepped up its
preparations for a flotation later this year by announcing the appointment
of Robert Wood as a non-executive director.
The appointment of Wood, deputy chairman of John Laing, the construction
company, brings the number of London Clubs' non-executives to five out of a
board of nine.
In 1992, the group secured new licences for its London casinos, putting
behind it the troubles which arose from a raid on its premises the previous
year.
Since then, the company has acquired a new non-executive chairman in Sir
Gordon Booth, a former senior diplomat and ex-director of Hanson. Alan
Goodenough, a veteran leisure operator, joined as chief executive last year.
Sir Gordon says the group particularly wants to tap Wood's property
expertise in the run-up to its listing.

Sir Wilfred Newton, who will step down as chairman of London Transport when
a successor is eventually found, has been appointed non-executive chairman
of Raglan Property Trust.
The appointment follows a change of senior management at Raglan a year ago,
when Keith Holman and Alan Fosler bought into the company.
Raglan, which is emerging from four years of losses, has a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 42m. Its strategy is to build up its rental
portfolio and trading activities and to develop a shopping mall in Banbury.
Sir Wilfred was invited to join Raglan's board as a result of connections
made in Hong Kong. Sir Wilfred, a former chairman of Hong Kong's Mass
Transport Railway and a non-executive director of HSBC, met Fosler and
Holmes when they were working in Hong Kong for the Mass Transport Railway
and HSBC.
Sir Wilfred, who is also a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings, Midland
Bank and Sketchley, over from the Hon Charles Cecil, who has resigned from
the board.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Moveable feast for hungry dealers - Renewed
activity in the poaching of staff is leading to new ideas for linking
loyalty to reward and ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong autumn bull runs in stocks and bonds have revived a recruiting
instinct hitherto languishing in hibernation for much of the recession.
Poaching has returned to the dealing rooms and the most successful lure, as
always, is money.
The poaching of individuals remained sporadic in the recession and the
defection of teams was beginning to look quite historical, one of those
quirks that characterised the Lawson boom. Not so. Poaching in its rawest,
most brutal form, is back.
Just how potentially destructive the practice can be was demonstrated in the
case of the so-called 'Lopez warriors' who followed Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, the head of global purchasing at General Motors, to Volkswagen.
Unusually in such cases, GM and Opel, its German subsidiary, decided to
fight the move, introducing allegations of industrial espionage against
Lopez for good measure.
While criminal investigations in Germany and the US relating to suspected
industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud are still in progress, a
Frankfurt civil court last month rejected claims that VW broke competition
rules.
Nowhere, however, has poaching been more pronounced recently than in the
securities houses and Smith New Court yesterday decided to tackle the
problem squarely by creating financial shackles for many employees and
transforming an element of the bonus into shares. The shares will be payable
only if the employees are still with the company in three years time.
Smith New Court has yet to announce its profits for last year but this kind
of reward cannot be paid out of fresh air. It is an expensive proposition
because the company is going out to the market to buy shares. It is seeking
approval from shareholders to hold up to 15 per cent of its equity in trust
for bonuses. The shares will be treated as cash for tax purposes. This means
that if, say, 100 shares were awarded, the employee would get 60, since tax
at 40 per cent would be paid by the company on behalf of the individual.
The move demonstrates how sensitive investment banks are becoming to their
employees walking out of the door.
What has tended to happen when a company loses a complete team of
professionals is that the poached turns poacher, often paying higher
salaries to re-recruit.
In the hot-house atmosphere of the dealing room there is often little scope
for loyalty, hence the payment of high salaries and the treatment of people
like commodities to be traded at the market price. The only difference is
that companies do the buying and the people sell themselves.
Few have been more active than NatWest Markets, which has been recruiting
heavily from competitors as it extends the operation it established 18
months ago on the bones of County NatWest.
Goldman Sachs has also been among the recent predators, luring the oils team
from SG Warburg and taking two property analysts from NatWest Securities.
The latter made its own move on Smith New Court's German analyst team and
NatWest Markets recruited the sterling distribution team of six from Hoare
Govett.
Trends influencing the activity are both seasonal and cyclical. Those in
financial market jobs tend to move at the beginning of the year after
bonuses have been paid. People become too costly at other times when
prospective employers have to compensate them for their lost bonus.
This seasonal trend has been more pronounced this year, partly because the
strong markets towards and at the beginning of the year led to renewed
confidence among both employees and employers. The other reason is that,
even though the markets have undergone a sizeable correction, the big
dealing rooms are positioning themselves for increased activity to come.
Another influence is the emerging markets of South East Asia and the Pacific
Rim. Expanding dealing rooms are drawing specialist operators from the more
established European and US teams.
Changes in financial market jobs are also being influenced by the extent to
which technology is advancing. Deryck Maughan, Salomon Brothers' chairman,
revealed recently that out of Dollars 2bn dollars the company marked up in
costs last year, some Dollars 450m was spent on technology.
Technological innovation has led to a market in backroom dealership staff as
equally hectic although much less visible than that in the front offices. It
has also led to the appearance of people termed mid-office staff, often
technicians whose skill is to ensure the system works as efficiently and
speedily as possible.
An official at one of the biggest firms said: 'If volumes are exploding you
can have any number of sales staff holding the phones, but if you can't
process the deals in time eventually one of them has to say no to a client.'
Joe Clark at Day Associates, a consulting company that provides salary
information for the city and investment banking said that new systems for
confirmation checking in banks and constant changes in information
technology were creating recruitment opportunities at a time that many
traditional banking administration jobs were disappearing.
The question that recruiters must address, particularly when poaching is an
issue, is whether it is time to bring back the restrictive covenants
preventing former managers recruiting their old teams or from taking
customers.
Mark Watson, a partner at Fox Williams, solicitors, which specialises in
employment law, says: 'You can see poaching going on in nearly every part of
the economy.'
Courts, he says, are approaching such constraints as restrictive covenants,
which companies have used to protect their interests in the past, with
little enthusiasm.
If restrictions are imposed, he says, they must be applied selectively and
sparingly. If courts are going to accept the argument that you are
protecting a legitimate business interest, it is necessary to show that only
a limited number of employees had access to what you may argue is
confidential information.
The most effective covenants, he argues, are those on the non-solicitation
of customers. The effectiveness of covenants on employees is more
questionable. 'The time is coming when employers may have to enforce
covenants more rigidly,' says Watson. Legal shackles, however, as Smith New
Court has shown, are not necessarily the favoured answer.
The Smith New Court scheme is something of a departure from the deferred
compensation deals that have become a growing feature of remuneration
packages at such firms.
Salomon Brothers tries to keep its best people by paying a percentage of
bonus in shares, not options, so that they have a direct incentive to
maintain the performance of the company. The shares are held in trust for
five years when they cannot be traded, but they belong to the employee and
are redeemable at the end of that period whether the employee has left the
company or not.
The idea behind the scheme is to encourage the feeling of partnership and
ownership that existed before Salomon became a public company. Share
allocation ranges from 2.5 per cent of bonus at the lower end to more than
50 per cent for higher earners. The scheme's strength can be gauged by the
fact that 19 per cent of the company's equity is now held by employees.
At Goldman Sachs, where the partnership structure is maintained, the 161
partners must plough back their share of profits into the company where the
capital is retained. When they retire or leave the company they receive a
proportion of their capital and the balance over a five year minimum period.
Partners were reputed to have received individual profit share-outs of
Dollars 5m each at the end of last year.
The generous bonuses paid to other staff were not sufficient to maintain the
loyalty of all. But one leaver, Michael Sherwood, the syndicate manager,
returned to the fold soon after leaving to work for a private Swiss bank.
Whether such retrospective loyalty will be rewarded with a partnership
remains to be seen.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Clarke faces the cutting question: Conflicting views over an
interest rate cut that the chancellor must weigh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England
hold their monthly monetary meeting today, it is assumed that Mr Kenneth
Clarke will be much more keen on an interest rate cut than Mr Eddie George
is.
Many believed that February's  1/4 percentage-point rate cut to 5.25 per
cent was a compromise between Mr Clarke (who wanted a  1/2 -point reduction)
and Mr George (who wanted no cut).
The first, and most compelling, reason for Mr Clarke to cut rates is the
forthcoming tax increases, such as the additional 1 per cent on National
Insurance contributions, and the restriction of the married couple's
allowance.
Economists differ about the likely impact of these increases on the
recovery, but there are signs that consumers are already cutting their
expenditure. Annual growth in retail sales fell to 2.5 per cent in February,
the slowest year-on-year rate since May. Consumer confidence slumped to a
four-year low in March, according to a Gallup poll.
The chancellor may feel that a cut in rates is needed to provide a clear
benefit to consumers and offset the psychological effect of the tax
increases.
Halifax building society has announced that a further  1/4 percentage-point
cut in base rates would prompt a mortgage rate reduction.
Mr Clarke must also be considering the Conservative party's prospects in
May's local, and June's European, elections. Under the new monetary
arrangements, with the Bank setting the timing of rate cuts, interest rate
adjustments are not supposed to be 'political'. Nevertheless, the markets
are cynical enough to look for political motives.
Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, says: 'For Clarke, the
closer we get to May and June, the more he can be accused of making a
political cut.' That might provoke the chancellor to push for an early cut.
If the governor, as expected, urges caution, he will have some plausible
reasons. February's cut was badly received by the markets, due to an
accompanying report which warned of the risk of rising inflation. The Bank's
anti-inflationary credibility was damaged, and Mr George is unlikely to want
it to suffer further.
Since February, bond markets have become much more pessimistic about
prospects for interest rates and inflation. World bond markets have tumbled
and the gilt market has particularly suffered.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist of Yamaichi International (Europe), points
out that the Treasury has made much of the inflationary expectations in the
gilt market. These have deteriorated sharply and now imply an inflation
forecast of 4.5 per cent. 'If the Treasury really thinks the market is worth
listening to, it's hard to justify a cut,' he adds.
Furthermore, futures prices indicate that traders expect base rates to rise
to 6 per cent by the end of 1994. And the pound has dipped sharply against
the D-Mark, falling at one point below DM2.50. A badly received rate cut
might provoke a sterling crisis.
Some good news on inflation is needed to change market sentiment, but
February's numbers, while not disastrous, were worse than expectations and
followed a worrying increase in the annual rate of growth in average
earnings.
However, Mr Barty of Morgan Grenfell says: 'Probably the Treasury and the
Bank don't share the market's worry about inflationary pressures. Taking the
January and February inflation numbers together, they were better than
expected.'
The government's target range for underlying inflation (excluding mortgage
interest payments) is 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and it is aiming for the
lower half of the range by the end of this parliament. The annual rate in
February was 2.8 per cent, still in the range's upper half, and a cut in
rates might cast further doubt on the anti-inflation resolve.
In the face of these arguments, analysts think the duo will compromise; the
Bank will sanction a cut, but only if it gets good inflation news.
March's inflation figures are the key, says Mr Don Smith, UK economist at
Midland Global Markets. He expects the Bank's measure of core inflation to
fall to 2 per cent. 'If it does, the authorities can cut. But if those
inflation figures are bad, you can kiss a rate cut goodbye until the
summer.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Ice-cream clash with EU looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading UK ice-cream manufacturers were yesterday cleared of
anti-competitive distribution practices by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. The decision, however, is set to spark a clash with Europe over
competition policy.
A nine-month inquiry found that 'freezer exclusivity' - providing free
freezer cabinets to shops on condition they are not used to stock ice-cream
from other suppliers - did not operate against the public interest.
The commission found no evidence of excessive prices or profits being made
in the sale of ice-cream for immediate consumption - so-called 'impulse
ice-cream'. It said recent market trends suggested competition had been
effective irrespective of any exclusivity.
But its conclusion that the tied offer of freezers to retailers was not a
barrier to market entry could bring the UK into conflict with Brussels.
The European Commission is also investigating the issue of freezer
exclusivity after a complaint from Mars, the US confectionery group, which
entered the impulse ice-cream business in 1989.
Brussels has yet to rule on the issue but an indication of its thinking came
recently when it vetted the takeover by Unilever, the UK-Dutch consumer
goods group, of Ortiz-Miko, France's third-biggest ice-cream producer. The
European Commission said freezer exclusivity was a serious barrier to market
entry.
Disagreement between London and Brussels over the issue could force the UK
authorities to back down, thereby throwing into doubt the practicality of
Brussels's attempts to encourage greater subsidiarity - the principle where
powers are devolved to the lowest practical level  - in competition policy.
The MMC report was welcomed by Unilever, whose subsidiary Birds Eye Walls
has two-thirds of the market for impulse purchases of wrapped ice-creams,
and more than half of the total UK impulse market, valued at Pounds 275m in
1992.
The company said it was 'a clear vindication of its practice of providing
free brand-linked freezer cabinets to its retail customers'. It has supplied
60,000 freezers to 42,000 shops in the UK.
Mr Simon Bullimore, managing director of Mars Confectionery, said the report
protected Wall's existing and profitable exclusive distribution
arrangements.
'Freezer exclusivity is clearly an anti-competitive practice which still
adversely affects competitors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers alike,'
he added.
The Consumers' Association was also critical. 'The MMC has once again failed
consumers with a muddle-headed and misguided report which puts the interests
of industry firmly in first place.'
The MMC found a simple monopoly existed in favour of Birds Eye Walls and a
complex monopoly in favour of BEW, Nestle, which bought Lyons Maid at the
end of 1992, and Mars. Together they accounted for 88 per cent of sales of
wrapped ice-creams for immediate consumption in 1992.
BEW and Nestle operate and enforce exclusivity where possible. Mars supplies
cabinets to retailers but only requires that a full range of its ice-creams
be stocked. The monopolies commission concluded this had the same effect as
exclusivity.
BEW and Nestle argued that freezer exclusivity had extended the market and
consumer choice to many small outlets which would not otherwise have stocked
ice-cream.
Mars had asked the MMC to ban exclusivity as anti-competitive. Since
entering the market in 1989 it has achieved a market share of 16 per cent
for wrapped ice-creams.
The MMC's conclusions were that exclusivity posed less of a problem than
when it last looked at the the market in 1979. Retailers could add a second
freezer, and this had happened in as much as 80 per cent of outlets. They
could terminate exclusive agreements at short notice and could purchase
their own freezer and buy ice-cream at lower prices.
It concluded: 'We are not convinced that consumer choice would be
significantly improved were exclusivity ended.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Tighter curbs on electricity prices urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity consumer representatives yesterday dismissed recent price cuts
in the industry as insufficient and pressed Professor Stephen Littlechild,
the regulator, to tighten price controls on power distribution companies.
The chairmen of the 12 electricity consumers' committees in England and
Wales said that while profits and dividends had increased since
privatisation, 'the ordinary non-investing customer has enjoyed little
financial benefit'.
They said there was no evidence that recent announcements of 'small' price
reductions and price standstills were prompted 'other than by a need for the
companies to remain within the current price formula'.
Of the 12 regional companies the highest cut was 6 per cent - by Norweb.
Five companies implemented freezes.
The committee chairmen said price reductions of at least 5 per cent would
have been appropriate.
They said they would lobby Prof Littlechild to take advantage of the
distribution price-control review, now under way, to tighten the price
formula.
Separately, Prof Littlechild yesterday announced standards that require the
12 regional electricity companies and two in Scotland to carry out Pounds
100m of expenditure on energy-efficiency measures in the next four years.
Under a review of prices of the companies' supply businesses conducted last
year, the regulator provided each company with an allowance of Pounds 1 per
customer per year for expenditure on energy-efficiency projects. These
include subsidising the fitting of insulation in customers' homes and
reducing the prices of energy-efficient appliances.
The key requirement of the standards is to ensure that the money raised by
the companies is spent on 'worthwhile projects which will benefit the
customer'.
The savings will be calculated in accordance with a formula proposed by the
Energy Savings Trust.
Companies will be encouraged to target special-needs customers, such as the
elderly, disabled and low-income families.
Prof Littlechild said the companies would produce annual reports which would
'allow for an informed public debate about the value to customers of the
energy-efficiency measures'.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Watchdog calls for steps to restrict water demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More household water meters should be installed to curb rising demand for
water, the National Rivers Authority, said yesterday.
In a strategy document published yesterday the authority, which is the
water-quality watchdog for England and Wales, predicts that water
consumption will grow steadily in almost every region by the year 2021, in
some cases by as much as 43 per cent from 1991.
According to the highest of its three sets of predictions, the biggest
increases are expected in the south-west region, with 43 per cent, East
Anglia with 37 per cent, and Severn Trent with 28 per cent. The lowest is
the north-west region with 15 per cent.
It calls for water companies to be obliged legally to promote efficient
water use. It wants them to cut leakage of water - estimated at about a
quarter - to 'economic' levels, to help remove the need for expensive new
reservoirs.
The water companies said yesterday: 'Most water companies will be able to
meet future demands without major new resource developments. The exceptions
will be those where population continues to grow.'
Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth yesterday failed to mount a High Court
challenge to the government's policy for improving water standards.
A High Court judge dismissed a claim by the environmental pressure group for
a judicial review of its claims that the government had breached both UK and
European law by agreeing to undertakings from Thames Water and Anglia Water
to reduce pesticide levels.
It had asked the judge to overturn an October 1991 decision by Mr Michael
Heseltine, then environment secretary, not to take enforcement action
against the companies, even though their water quality breached a European
directive on pesticide levels.
Member countries should have complied with the 1982 directive by 1985.
However, the government has allowed UK companies more time for compliance -
until December 1998 in some cases.
Friends of the Earth had argued that the government had broken the law by
not taking more vigorous enforcement action.
However, Mr Justice Schiemann said there was no evidence the government had
acted illegally in any way.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Buy-out teams emerge in British Coal ahead of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several potential management buy-out teams are emerging within British Coal
as the corporation prepares to publish preliminary information next month
about the five areas on offer for privatisation.
None of the possible bids involves executive board members, although at
least one regional director, Mr Alan Houghton of the central north region
containing most of the Yorkshire pits, is believed to be interested in
leading a bid for the mines he manages.
According to Coal UK, the Financial Times newsletter, Mr Bob Siddall,
director of British Coal's opencast operations, is studying the possibility
of bidding for all deep-mine areas in England. Mr Jeff Ainley, manager of
the Hatfield pit near Doncaster, has also told British Coal of his interest
in leading a management buy-out of the pit.
Separate bids are thought to be under consideration by managers in Wales and
Scotland for the regions in which they operate.
British Coal would not comment yesterday on whether any managers had
notified the chairman of their interests.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told the Commons yesterday that the
corporation had given instructions to employees to ensure that no potential
purchasers were given preferential access to information before
privatisation.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Oftel plans renewed assault on BT's dominance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, plans a raft of fresh
measures aimed at encouraging competition for British Telecom.
Mr Cruickshank intends to make the UK's regulatory regime more accommodating
to companies planning new services, and to take a more active stance in
policing existing operators.
BT, which commands nearly 90 per cent of the UK telecoms market, is likely
to come under closer scrutiny by Oftel, the telecoms regulatory office
headed by Mr Cruickshank. But cable companies building combined television
and telephone networks in urban areas can also expect to have their
activities examined.
In a report on future policy, included in Oftel's 1993 annual report
published yesterday, Mr Cruickshank was sharply critical of the status quo.
'New entrants are not yet delivering the range of choice I am looking for,'
he said. 'We cannot relax merely because licences have been issued and
promises made . . . we still have a long, long way to go.'
He is impressed by the greater range of telecoms services in the US, and
Oftel will publish studies comparing the range and quality of services in
the UK with those of the US and France.
Areas highlighted for Oftel scrutiny in the next year include cable
companies' adherence to Oftel-agreed timetables for constructing networks.
The annual report shows a sharp fall in consumer complaints to Oftel, from
41,026 in 1992 to 23,413 last year.
Separately, BT and Mercury, its main competitor, have announced cuts of up
to 25 per cent in the price of international ISDN services, high-capacity
lines used by businesses for data transfer and video-conferencing.
The government signalled its concern yesterday at delays by US authorities
in allowing British operators to compete in the US.
Lord Strathclyde, a Department of Trade and Industry minister, told a
conference in London: 'In the US some interests seem to want to close off
their market to international competition rather than see International
Simple Resale (ISR) bring down tariffs.'
ISR would allow new competitors to use leased international lines to provide
a service connected to the public network in both the US and the UK. The US
is blocking ISR pending studies of the 'openness' of the UK market.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Gas users advised to check meters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gas customers have been urged to read their meters tomorrow to avoid being
overcharged when value added tax is introduced on April 1.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, said that British Gas would estimate
customers' average daily use before and after April 1 to calculate the VAT
to be applied to individual bills.
Cold weather around that date could cause consumers to use more gas than
later in the quarter, and thus be overcharged for VAT.
British Gas has agreed to re-bill customers for the quarter if its estimate
is higher than the actual meter readings.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Imro pledges to review standards and procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, has
committed itself to reviewing its standards, approach to monitoring and
discipline procedures within the coming year.
The proposals were set out yesterday in its regulatory plan for 1994-95.
Publication of the plan makes Imro the first self-regulating organisation to
meet this recommendation from the Large review of financial regulation.
The change in the approach to monitoring will see Imro move to a system
based on assessment of risk. 'High-risk' businesses and areas of greatest
investor risk within those will be the focus of the most intense regulatory
activity and the most frequent inspection visits.
Mr Philip Thorpe, Imro chief executive, said the plans would mean a 12 per
cent increase in costs in the year from spending in 1993-94, taking the
budget to Pounds 12.8m.
Most of the increase comes from a rise in the number of staff dealing with
monitoring and enforcement.
A further Pounds 2.75m will be paid in fees to the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
Among the other targets Imro has set itself for the coming year are the
introduction of individual registration and closer co-operation with staff
from SIB on collective investment schemes.
Such specific projects will run alongside the continuing core objective of
supervising its 1,150 members so as to provide effective investor
protection.
Imro also intends each quarter to publish statistical performance indicators
covering areas such as membership applications and disciplinary
investigations.
A plan will be produced annually with a review of progress and new targets
set for the year ahead.
Mr Thorpe said he saw one benefit of the exercise as giving people a better
idea of what regulators do.
This would improve both transparency and help to reduce the prospects of
unrealistic expectations.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Faster pension reform demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reforming valuation of lump sums transferred out of occupational pension
schemes and their presentation to potential investors should be carried out
more quickly than City regulators intend, the National Association of
Pension Funds said yesterday.
In advance of today's debate in the Commons on private pensions and
financial regulation, the association urged the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, to move more quickly than it has proposed
in improving this aspect of pension transfers.
The association said the report from SIB on improving standards in this area
of business - which was published last week - was an important step towards
ensuring that people were given proper advice.
But Mr Tom Ross, association vice-chairman, said the system of fixed-rate
projections 'which produce huge estimates that ignore inflation, should be
ditched for transfer value business. This should not be delayed until
September 1995 as SIB proposes'.
He added that it would be vital for the Personal Investment Authority - the
new regulator to protect the private investor - to set and monitor high
standards 'which are externally recognised for the selling of
personal-pension business and which will restore consumer confidence'.
In today's debate, however, some backbench MPs are expected to express
doubts about the PIA's ability to deliver high standards of investor
protection.
The proportion of people expecting to retire at or before the age of 62 has
dropped sharply, a survey by market research group Mintel says. It found
that 54 per cent expected to retire before 62 - in 1990 the figure was about
two-thirds.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Ministers accused on Ulster committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the government of engaging in 'gerrymandering at
its worst' by allotting representatives of Ulster's nationalist community
only one seat on the new 13-member Northern Ireland select committee. The
opposition, however, failed in its attempt to replace Tory nominees.
As MPs cleared the way for the new body to begin work soon after Easter, Mr
Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, charged ministers
with misrepresenting Labour's parliamentary strength by giving it only two
seats.
Mr McNamara said ministers were setting up the committee in return for
support from the Ulster Unionist party's nine MPs in a 'squalid' deal to
shore up an 'increasingly shaky' government.
The formation of the committee - widely seen as a symbol of the government's
commitment to the province's unionist majority - 'reduces still further' the
prospects of agreement on a devolved Ulster assembly with a broad Irish
dimension, he said.
MPs from both leading unionist parties spoke in support of the committee but
Mr Eddie McGrady, the MP for South Down who is set to be the mainly Roman
Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party's sole representative, said his
party had not been consulted on it.
MPs rejected a series of Labour motions seeking to replace Tory nominees for
the committee with its own representatives. The original motion setting out
the names of the committee members was then approved without a vote.
In Belfast, loyalist terrorists yesterday launched a gun and rocket attack
on Sinn Fein offices and said they would continue to target Sinn Fein and
the IRA whether or not they accepted the Downing Street declaration.
No one was injured in the attack, for which the outlawed Ulster Freedom
Fighters admitted responsibility.
Sinn Fein later called on Dublin to join it in pressing for a public inquiry
into allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and agents of
the British government to attack nationalists.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Gallup in switch on Top 40 chart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gallup, the polling organisation which is fighting for the right to compile
an alternative to the Top 40 pop chart, argued nearly four years ago that
having more than one chart would damage the music industry.
Now, having earlier this year lost the contract to compile the music charts
to Millward Brown, a rival research company, Gallup is seeking to obtain
continued access to record dealers' data.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said last week the way
the Top 40 was compiled was 'significantly anti-competitive' and that he was
referring it to the Restrictive Practices Court.
The contract is awarded by the Chart Information Network, which is owned by
the British Phonographic Industry and the trade publication Music Week.
The British Association of Record Dealers has agreed to supply sales
information only to the network and its contracted research organisation.
In May 1990, Gallup expressed concern over the possibility that separate
charts could be compiled by Music Week and the BPI.
In the 1990 letter to Music Week's publishers, Gallup said: 'This is a
recipe for total chaos and will have an adverse effect on the whole
industry. Gallup . . . abhor this total waste of the industry's energies.'
Mr John Pinder, Gallup's charts director, said yesterday that Gallup's
concern in 1990 arose from the possibility of a split between the record
companies and the music retailers, who were supporting the proposed Music
Week chart.
The co-operation of both sides of the industry was necessary to produce the
music charts. But Gallup felt the information should not only be available
to one research company, he said.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Obituary: Sir Roy Griffiths - NHS reformer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Roy Griffiths, the government's adviser on National Health Service
management reforms, and before that managing director of J. Sainsbury, the
retailer, has died at the age of 67.
The publication of the Griffiths report in 1983 heralded the most radical
reform of the health service since it was established in 1948 by Aneurin
Bevan, Labour minister of health. Without this report, the controversial
recent introduction of the internal health market would have been
impossible.
Sir Roy proposed introducing hospitals to standard general management
principles, with chief executives and directors of finance. Until then they
had been run on a consensus and committee-led model.
His proposal to create 1,000 general managers was accepted by the
government, and introduced gradually over the period to 1988, with far less
controversy than attended many other public-sector reforms of the time.
His second significant contribution to the health service concerned the
establishment of the 'care in the community' policy, which was started a
year ago after his report on the subject in 1987.
This included the recommendation that local authorities should be the lead
bodies for providing community care.
In spite of wide disagreements, the government accepted his view in the only
significant extension of local authorities' power and responsibilities since
the Conservatives came to office in 1979.
He remained a defender of the managerial culture he had introduced as
ministers attacked alleged NHS bureaucracy.
He was already a successful businessman when he started his work on the
health service, having been a director of Sainsbury's from 1968 to 1991.
While he was managing director, from 1979 to 1988, the supermarket chain
enjoyed strong growth and achieved its present position as the UK's largest
retailer.

Mr Michael Howard's proposal that murderers of police and prison officers
should stay in jail until they die was rejected by a specially convened
meeting of cabinet ministers and officials yesterday.
The home secretary had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, last
week seeking cabinet backing for an amendment to the criminal justice bill
now before parliament which would ensure a life sentence for that category
of murder would mean life.
Mr Major was understood to be concerned that the move could be
counter-productive in creating a violent category of prisoner who felt they
had nothing to lose.

Plans for a Pounds 50m extension of Tyne and Wear's Metro rapid transit

Tighe writes.
The proposals, which would extend Metro services 11.5 miles to Sunderland,
comprise a mixture of new track and stations along the south bank of the
River Wear, and the shared use of existing rail track and stations between
Pelaw, near Gateshead, and Sunderland. The target completion date is 1999.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Health pay put first in line for treatment: The new chief
executive of the NHS tells Alan Pike of his plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first challenges for Mr Alan Langlands, who becomes chief
executive of the National Health Service on Friday, will be to put a
strategy for introducing local pay bargaining in place by early autumn.
Last month's reports from the pay review bodies for medical staff called for
the devolution of pay determination to local level. The review bodies and
the government see this as an inevitable consequence of the 1991 NHS
reforms, but most hospitals and health authorities have been slow to take up
the challenge of dismantling the service's centralised pay structures.
Mr Langlands said in an interview with the Financial Times that this year
the NHS management would have to give the review bodies a 'convincing
explanation' of what changes could be achieved in 1995. 'Our initial
evidence to the review bodies in the autumn will have to reflect very
significant progress.'
Transitional arrangements were likely to be proposed, rather than trying to
change the existing structure in a single leap, he said. He was also
concerned that local managers taking on the new responsibilities should
understand that human resource management involved more than just pay.
Attention must be given to wider terms and conditions, communications,
training and staffing structures.
'It is not just a case of sending a brief signal saying: do it. It is about
getting managers to understand the importance of harnessing the workforce
for the good of the organisation. This has got to be a two-way street.
Employees have got to get something out of it as well.'
Mr Langlands is, like Sir Duncan Nichol - his predecessor to whom he was
deputy - a career NHS manager. He takes over as chief executive exactly
three years after the government's health reforms restructured the service
around an internal market. Although Mr Langlands acknowledged that the
quality of NHS managers continued to vary, he said the reforms had liberated
them from much of the service's old hierarchy and increased opportunities
for effective management at local level.
One of his early tasks will be to issue new codes on corporate governance,
prepared in the wake of examples of serious mismanagement and abuse of
procedures in Wessex and West Midlands regional health authorities.
Drafts of the codes had, said Mr Langlands, produced positive comments from
the Audit Commission, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and Mr Robert
Sheldon, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee.
The Labour party published a health policy consultation document last month
which, while pledging to abolish the market principles of the government's
reforms, retained organisational separation between the purchasing of
healthcare and its provision. Mr Langlands believed this is one of a number
of examples of growing political consensus on health policy, which he
welcomed. One area where there is no consensus, however, is the GP
fund-holding scheme, which Labour and the British Medical Association say
has led to some family doctors gaining fast-track hospital treatment for
their patients.
Mr Langlands said that while he recognised the concerns of some doctors,
most criticisms of fundholding had related to single, anecdotal cases. He
believes the overall fairness of the scheme can be demonstrated.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Changes called for on employers' liability insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance buyers at large UK companies are warning that changes will need to
be made to employers' liability insurance.
Most risk and insurance managers are concerned about the continuing
viability of the present system, according to Airmic, the risk managers'
association.
Under the present system all employers are legally obliged to buy cover to
pay claims from employees who are injured or who suffer illness through
work, the association found in a survey whose results were reported on the
first day of its annual conference.
'It does appear that we have created a dinosaur which, in the eyes of our
members is costly, outdated and counter-productive,' said Mr Geoff Saunders,
risk manager with RTZ and chairman of Airmic. Too often the present system
involved expensive legal confrontation, he said.
'We should scrap EL insurance in favour of a fairer no-fault,
structured-settlement approach, probably incorporating an arbitration
procedure,' added Mr Saunders.
Beneficiaries of no-fault compensation systems do not have to prove that
they are injured as a result of negligence.
The survey also found that member companies were concerned by the incidence
of industrial diseases, which now account for more than 50 per cent of all
liability claims.
Risk managers are also worried by the possibility of future restrictions
which insurers are expected to introduce for liability policies. Moves to
introduce a limit of indemnity have been triggered by developments in the
reinsurance market.
A separate survey found that member companies still regard a fire or
explosion as the most significant threat to their business.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Iraq arms move defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government decision to adopt a more liberal policy on arms sales to Iraq
without announcing it to parliament was a 'correct political decision',
former trade and defence minister Lord Trefgarne told the Scott inquiry
yesterday.
Lord Trefgarne was one of three ministers who, in early 1989, decided on a
form of words to be used in parliamentary answers that would not indicate
that the government had secretly relaxed military-related exports to Iraq.
The others were former trade minister Mr Alan Clark, and Mr William
Waldegrave, the then foreign minister who is now the minister for open
government.
Yesterday Lord Trefgarne stuck by what has emerged in the Scott inquiry as
the government position. 'It is true that Mr Waldegrave, Mr Clark and I
authorised officials to apply (the guidelines) more flexibly. But
guidelines, as the word implies, are not hard and fast laws anyway so that
was entirely proper,' he said in a prepared statement to the inquiry.
Lord Trefgarne, the last minister to appear before the inquiry, said it was
the duty of ministers not to lie or mislead members of parliament, but
said:'You don't have to tell them everything.'
Any announcement should be made 'in circumstances and terms that suit the
government of the day best'.
Lord Trefgarne was one of several ministers whose answers to parliamentary
questions in 1989 conveyed the impression that the guidelines restricting
arms exports to Iraq had remained unchanged since first announced in 1985.
Yesterday he conceded that ministers had agreed on a new form of wording
which allowed officials to approve the export to Iraq of machine tools and
other equipment with a potential military application. These included air
defence radars which were later used against US and European fighter
aircraft after the invasion of Kuwait.
He was pressed by Lord Justice Scott on whether adoption of a more flexible
policy did not amount to a change of policy which should have been announced
to parliament, given MPs' concerns about Iraq's chemical attacks on the
Kurds at the time.
Lord Trefgarne replied: 'I am concerned to ensure that you understand that
the policy was not changed. If there are words in the documents that lead
you to think otherwise, then you should disregard them.'
Lord Trefgarne had at first resisted appearing at the inquiry, expressing
doubts about the procedures being followed by the judge.
Yesterday he gave evidence flanked by his counsel, Sir Patrick Neill QC,
whose costs are being borne by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The hearing was adjourned until today after Lord Trefgarne, under legal
advice, refused to answer further questions without being given more time to
consider them.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Reuters raps information 'misers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters, the news and financial information group, has revealed a lurking
threat to British business - the information miser.
Research commissioned by it showed that more than two-thirds of British
directors believe their bosses and colleagues play 'information politics' by
hoarding rather than sharing vital knowledge.
Disinterested observers who might suppose Reuters has an axe to grind would
be correct: the reporting of this new scourge coincided with the launch
yesterday of two new Reuters on-line business information products.
The survey of more than 500 British executives says one in three claims to
have had vital business information withheld from them - half of those
blaming the 'political' ambition of peers and seniors.
Nearly 90 per cent believed a free flow of information was vital to their
businesses. Two-thirds also believed they spent more time than they should
just searching for the right information - an average of two hours per week.
Ms Marion King, managing director of Reuters Business Information, said:
'Organisations need to have information policies - a formal method of
communicating information upwards, downwards and around the organisation.'
Reuters is marketing two information services - Business Briefing, which
offers subscribers direct access to either current or archive information,
and Business Alert, which automatically provides updates within pre-set
criteria. Industry research estimates the European market for on-line
information was worth Pounds 2bn last year and is projected to reach Pounds
4.77bn by 1997 - a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Rolling-stock plan for London Tube approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday bowed to pressure from its own backbench MPs and
the business community by approving a competition to find a supplier of new
rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line.
London Underground has held talks in recent months with ABB Transportation,
the Derby-based company, over the supply of 100 new trains at an estimated
cost of Pounds 440m plus a 20-year maintenance contract valued at Pounds
300m.
Progress has been blocked by Treasury objections that the proposed deal did
not transfer enough of the risk out of the public sector and on to the
supplier. This was in spite of support for the deal from the private finance
panel established by the government to promote private-sector involvement in
infrastructure projects.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced an open competition to
find a supplier but stressed that final approval would still depend on a bid
meeting the Treasury's requirements. He believed there was a good prospect
of this happening.
ABB, which is part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri group, said it was
delighted by the government decision and planned to bid keenly for the
project. It had previously warned that failure to win the contract could
lead to the loss of 600 jobs at its Derby factory.
Although ABB faces competition from other rolling-stock manufacturers, it is
completing the delivery of similar trains for the Underground's Central Line
so would be spared the cost of establishing a production line from scratch.
London Underground will advertise the contract in the European Union's
official journal, as EU rules require. ABB said if it won the bidding it
could start delivering the trains early next year.
London First, the business organisation set up to promote the capital,
welcomed the move but said it hoped the Treasury did not regard this as an
isolated exception to its normal rules.
'We hope this marks a move towards a more flexible approach,' it said.
Rolling stock on the Northern Line is 30 years old, and while reliability
has improved in recent months it is known as 'the misery line' by London
commuters.
The Northern Line announcement formed part of a package of measures unveiled
yesterday to improve the quality of life in London. Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, announced proposals to make the capital tidier and to
make better use of the river Thames, for travel, transport and recreation.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Early retirement expectations fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of people expecting to retire at or before the age of 62 has
dropped sharply, a survey by market research group Mintel says.
The research, conducted before the announcement of the government's
intention to raise the retirement age for women, found that 54 per cent
expected to retire before 62 - the figure in 1990, when the research was
last carried out, was about two-thirds.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Pension transfer proposal criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reforming valuation of lump sums transferred out of occupational pension
schemes and presentation to potential investors should be carried out more
quickly than City regulators intend, the National Association of Pension
Funds said yesterday.
In advance of today's debate in the Commons on private pensions and
financial regulation, the association urged the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, to move more quickly than it has proposed
in improving this aspect of of pension transfers.
The association said that the report from SIB on improving standards in this
area of business - which was published last week - was an important step
towards ensuring that people were given proper advice.
But Mr Tom Ross, NAPF vice-chairman, said the system of fixed-rate
projections 'which produce huge estimates that ignore inflation, should be
ditched for transfer value business. This should not be delayed until
September 1995 as SIB proposes'.
He added that it would be vital for the Personal Investment Authority - the
new regulator to protect the private investor - to set and monitor high
standards 'which are externally recognised for the selling of personal
pension business and which will restore consumer confidence'.
In today's debate, however, some backbench MPs are expected to express
doubts about the PIA's ability to deliver high standards of investor
protection.
The new regulator received some support yesterday from Autif, the trade
association for the unit trust industry. It issued a statement saying that
it backed the PIA as 'the only way to improve the position of the public in
the short term'.
At the same time the association would like to see 'a leavening of
commercial expertise' among the PIA staff.
In the PIA's organisation plan, published yesterday, three senior members of
the existing regulators will be responsible for the legal, policy
development and member relations departments. A firm of headhunters is being
hired to find a fourth executive to deal with finance.

FT  30 MAR 94 / BBC Arabic news service is planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 200 broadcasting jobs will be created in London following
yesterday's announcement that the BBC has signed a 10-year agreement to
supply programmes for a new 24-hour Arabic-language television channel.
The satellite channel, aimed at the Middle East and north Africa, will be
launched from BBC Television Centre in west London in the next few months.
The service, from BBC World Service Television, is being financed by the
Mawarid investment and industrial group of Saudi Arabia.
The programme supply and distribution agreement - worth about Pounds 200m -
is with Orbit Communications Company, a Rome-based subsidiary of Mawarid.
The BBC will initially offer six hours a day of international and Middle
East news and then move to a 24-hour schedule before the end of the year.
The channel was the subject of threatened litigation between the BBC and Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Star TV in Hong Kong.
Star TV saw the new Arabic channel as a breach of its contract with the BBC
because the two satellite services overlapped geographically.
It is likely, however, that Star TV had wanted to terminate its contract
with the BBC for some time, and a compromise deal was agreed last week.
The BBC will next month vacate its slot on the northern beam of the Star
satellite system aimed at China in return for an extension on the south
beam.
This means that the BBC will be able to continue broadcasting to India until
1995.
BBC World Service Television has also recently signed a deal for a joint
venture in Japan.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Major told to resign by Euro-sceptic Tory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Backbench Conservative anger over Mr John Major's handling of the European
enlargement crisis exploded in the Commons yesterday as Mr Tony Marlow, a
long-standing Euro-sceptic, demanded the prime minister's resignation.
As glum Tory MPs digested the compromise, Mr Marlow told Mr Major: 'No
objective observer believes this so-called compromise has achieved anything
of real value to the UK. As of now, you have no authority, credibility or
identifiable policy in this vital area. Why don't you stand aside and make
way for somebody else?'
Mr Major snapped back: 'Anybody listening to what you have had to say . . .
would in no sense suggest that you were an objective observer of any matters
relating to the Community. It might be a useful novelty if from time to time
you were prepared to support the government you were elected to support.'
The exchanges reflected bitterness among Euro-sceptic MPs, many of whom
believe that the prime minister failed to deliver the strong defence of
Britain's interests that he promised last week.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said the agreement was 'sad and
humiliating', and warned that it would be opposed by some Conservative MPs
when it comes before the Commons later this year.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South West, said people would one
day tell the government: 'You must say no, and mean it.'
Some rightwingers endorsed Mr Marlow's outburst, claiming that many MPs
would like to see Mr Major replaced. But others said that was likely to
prove counter-productive.
Mr Terry Dicks, MP for Hayes and Harlington, said Mr Marlow 'has not got the
nous to realise that he did the Euro-sceptics' cause more harm than any 40
speeches by Mr Major'.
The enlargement compromise was welcomed by many Conservatives as the best
available deal. Mr Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the backbench 1922
Committee, said the government would have the support of the vast majority
of Conservative MPs.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the agreement was 'a humiliating
climbdown following an unnecessary conflict'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'The government has
made a fool of Britain in Europe; the cabinet has made a fool of the foreign
secretary, and the prime minister has made rather a fool of himself.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Peers back Sunday trading changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords last night agreed with the Commons that there should only
be partial de-regulation of Sunday trading for shops in England and Wales.
In a series of free votes peers rejected total de-regulation by a majority
of 257 (303-46), and an attempt to impose the restrictions advocated by the
Keep Sunday Special campaign by 55 votes (206-151).
In a final vote peers agreed without a division to keep the provision in the
Sunday trading bill already approved by the Commons which permits small
shops to set their own opening hours, but restricts supermarkets and other
large stores to six hours of trading.
While stressing that the party whips would not be in operation, Earl
Ferrers, home office minister, warned peers that there would be little
advantage in passing amendments which required the Commons to 'think again'.
Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, led a full bench of bishops
into the lobby in favour of the Keep Sunday Special option against total
deregulation.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Pounds 9.4m aid to halt Jaguar move abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to pay Pounds 9.4m in grant aid to Jaguar, the luxury car
subsidiary of Ford, to deter the US carmaker from moving the assembly of the
next generation Jaguar XJS sports car from the UK to Portugal.
The European Commission, which approved the aid yesterday, said that 883
jobs would be safeguarded at Jaguar by 1998 through the granting of regional
selective assistance. Jaguar will also receive up to Pounds 1.8m in
assistance in kind for training from the local authorities in Coventry and
Birmingham.
It is understood that Ford, which acquired Jaguar in late 1989, had closely
considered transferring the Pounds 187m sports car project to its plant at
Azambuja, close to Lisbon, where it assembles the Transit van.
The Portuguese authorities had bidded for the project with an attractive
rival aid package.
Jaguar is due to begin production of the car, code-named X100, in 1996. It
will replace the ageing XJS grand tourer coupe and convertible range, which
was launched in 1975.
The commission said that Jaguar planned to invest Pounds 187m in the X100
project during the four years from 1993 to 1997.
Jaguar intends to install a new low-cost, low-volume production facility in
its plant at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, where the body for the new range
will be welded and painted.
The project will mark a new stage in the integration of Jaguar into the Ford
production network. The body panels for the X100 will be stamped at Ford's
plant at Halewood, Merseyside, while a new range of V8 engines, code-named
AJ26, will be produced at Ford's engine plant at Bridgend in south Wales.
Jaguar is investing about Pounds 100m in the new engine range, which will be
launched first in the X100.
The commission said yesterday: 'Given that the new project requires the
replacement of the old body and car assembly line of the XJS, the company
has actively examined various alternative locations for this project.'
It is understood that Ford also looked initially at possible locations in
the US, but the aid package made Portugal the main rival to continuing
assembly in the UK.
The grant will be paid in instalments from this year until 1997 and there is
a provision for withholding or clawing back aid if there is
'under-achievement' in safeguarding employment.
The first stage in the renewal of Jaguar's range will be reached this
summer, when it begins production of the new generation XJ6, code-named
X300, in which it is investing about Pounds 150m.

The firm wants to allocate a proportion of its annual bonuses to staff in
the form of its own shares. These would be held in trust and only handed
over three years later to those still working for the firm.
The personnel manager of one competitor said yesterday: 'Smith New Court is
taking a calculated risk. This may make it more difficult for them recruit
staff. It may also up the bids and add to labour costs. The only winners
will be the recruitment consultants.'
A headhunting firm said the scheme reflected increasing concern about
poaching of top employees. 'We are finding that forms of deferred
compensation are proving popular,' it said. 'Increasingly people are getting
paid a good proportion of their bonus in terms of shares.'
In the secretive world of City securities houses few are willing to comment
publicly on remuneration which is often high and sometimes structured to
avoid tax payments.
However, a number of securities houses have introduced some element of
compensation designed to generate staff loyalty, including deferred cash
bonuses and share options. Most differentiate between current-year bonuses
and long-term share option plans designed to boost loyalty.
The Smith New Court proposals stand out because they: link the two elements;
use existing shares rather than new equity; involve a high proportion of
total equity - up to 15 per cent; and will be used with a relatively large
number of employees - perhaps 15 per cent of the total.
The concept is less surprising to US firms, which were largely de-regulated
in the early 1970s. Merrill Lynch pays some senior staff a proportion of
bonus in shares. Lehman Brothers is believed to offer staff compensation
deferred over three years.
Salomon Brothers, the securities arm of Salomon, has been paying some staff
a proportion of their bonuses in shares for about three years so that 19 per
cent of equity is now held by staff. Shares are held in trust for five years
during which time they cannot be traded. Thereafter they are redeemable
whether or not the employee has left the company.
Some firms, such as Goldman Sachs, have been able to retain staff loyalty
because bonuses are paid in the form of equity stakes that cannot be cashed
without considerable difficulty.
In the UK, some argue that high staff turnover and low loyalty began with
de-regulation of the City's financial institutions in 1986. Until then,
brokers were traditionally privately held partnerships whose staff held
shares. As the organisations obtained stock market quotations, this loyalty
through ownership was lost.
Ironically, the firms said still to be among the most profitable are those
which retained the more traditional ownership structure with their shares
held privately, including Cazenove, based in the UK, and Goldman Sachs.

FT  30 MAR 94 / CBI pulls out of talks on works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday withdrew from discussions on
the ground rules for establishing works councils in European multi-nationals
as Unice, the European employers' body, went further than the British
employers' group was prepared to accept.
The CBI's decision to withdraw, after pressure from members and other UK
employers' groups, will not prevent talks continuing - at least until
tomorrow - between Unice and the European Trades Union Congress.
But it raises questions about the viability of the social dialogue between
Unice and the ETUC, which the European Commission is keen to promote as an
alternative to producing detailed directives. CBI officials say the social
dialogue as now structured does not allow national employers' organisations
to consult their members properly.
On works councils, the CBI objected to the accepted Unice principle that
there should be minimum requirements if voluntary agreement at company level
is not possible, and also that information and consultation should be a
legally enforceable right.
The government's opt-out from some aspects of the social chapter means UK
employers will only be affected by works council legislation through their
continental European businesses.
The commission has agreed to pass a directive on works councils if Unice and
the ETUC fail to reach agreement. That means the ETUC has little incentive
to agree to anything less than what is laid out in the directive.
Ninety-one per cent of foreign-owned companies would not change their
attitude to the UK if the government reduced its commitment to the European
Union, a survey has found.
The size of the UK market is the main attraction for foreign investors,
according to a survey of 800 executives of foreign-owned companies,
conducted for the accountants and management consultants KPMG Peat Marwick.
Only 3 per cent of foreign companies cited cheap labour as an investment
reason.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Brussels denies social policy concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government was facing further trouble over European Union enlargement
last night after the European Commission rejected Britain's interpretation
of 'assurances' on social policy.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said assurances given by the commission
met Britain's concerns that the health and safety provisions of the Treaty
of Rome were being used to circumvent Britain's opt-out from the social
chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
But Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, said he had 'simply
clarified the programme of the commission for the present year'. Mr Padraig
Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said there had been no concession on
social policy.
It also emerged that the assurances will cease to be valid at the of the
year, when a new commission takes office. British officials said they
believed the undertakings would be accepted by the next commission.
Mr Major told the Commons that the assurances meant that the commission's
use of the health and safety provisions would be restricted to measures
'directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work'.
He said this meant there would be no repetition of the commission's attempt
to use the health and safety provisions to impose a directive on working
time, which Britain has challenged in the European Court.
The commission had also accepted that the UK would be excluded completely
from proposals under the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, he said. This
would mean the proposals to set up works councils would not be imposed on
the British operations of transnational companies.
Earlier Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, told the cabinet that the
assurances would also block the imposition in Britain of three directives
expected to be brought forward shortly by Mr Flynn.
The directives deal with discrimination in the workplace, employment
conditions for part-time workers and parental-leave rights under the health
and safety provisions.
Downing Street officials said Britain would welcome the only two other
directives - on factory inspection procedures and mine safety - expected to
be tabled under the health and safety provisions.
The British interpretation, however, was flatly rejected in Brussels.
Officials said Britain had asked for a written assurance from Mr Delors, but
received only a tart 'verbal reminder' that previously agreed procedures for
social policy were written down in the EU treaty and in regulations - and
remained so.
Publicly, the commission merely restated three arcane references in the
'reminder', provided on Monday to Sir John Kerr, Britain's ambassador to the
EU, by Mr Flynn and Mr Delors.
But the UK's request was described privately by a commission official as
'simply intolerable. We are not going to let them imply that there is a
trade-off in social policy,' he said.
'You can't negotiate concessions from the commission on social policy; there
are 11 other member states.'
The commission told the UK that all social measures proposed for 1994 under
the Maastricht treaty's clause 118A 'are directly concerned with health and
safety'.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Anxiety over economy led to change of tack: Hosokawa has had
to take a more pragmatic line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, who last month claimed
that US-Japan relations had turned into a 'mature relationship' following
his rejection of American demands on trade, yesterday's package represented
a a return to more pragmatic approach in dealings with the US.
Concerns that increased tensions will hurt the Japanese government and also
the sluggish economy have overcome initial euphoria among government
officials and the media which applauded a Japan that can say No to the US.
Foreign ministry officials are worried that increased tensions over trade
could harm the overall US-Japan relationship at a time when Japan's
importance as an ally to US seems to be declining with the end of the cold
war.
The economic consequences are also causing anxiety. The sharp rise in the
yen following the breakdown of the talks in February is squeezing exporters'
profits and threatening an economic recovery expected later this year.
Implementation of sanctions by the US would also deprive Japan's
export-dependent manufacturers of one of their largest markets.
And the increasing trade friction between the two countries is creating a
political risk for Mr Hosokawa, whose popularity is waning amid mounting
pressure from the opposition Liberal Democratic party to clarify his links
with Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company at the centre of several recent
scandals and which provided the prime minister with a Y100m (Pounds 636,900)
loan 10 years ago.
According to an opinion poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business
daily, Mr Hosokawa's approval rate this week fell to 47.6 per cent, dropping
below 50 per cent for the first time since his appointment last August. He
cannot afford to provide the LDP with extra ammunition by failing to resolve
the stalemate with the US over trade and jeopardising the relationship.
However, the package appears to have failed to persuade the US to reopen the
so-called framework talks on trade. Some US officials expressed
dissatisfaction at the lack of specific figures for an income tax cut and
for levels of government expenditure, which are scheduled to be announced in
June in time for the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations.
Although yesterday's package included no radical new ideas, US government
officials and businessmen did admit that the easing of regulations and
increased transparency indicate a move in the right direction.
The measures, in opening up the Japanese market to US manufacturers, will in
theory aid economic efficiency, which would be of key assistance to a mature
economy set for slow growth over the next decade.
Japanese government officials had hoped the package would allow them to
prove that they can set voluntary trade policies after last month's
bilateral framework talks failed to go beyond negotiations over binding
import quotas. However, for the US, the programme only to have confirmed old
beliefs that foreign pressure is the only way to get results out of Japan.
Analysts expect the US to maintain the pressure over trade. 'The yen will
remain volatile as it will be used as a policy tool aimed at Japan until the
US sees actual results,' said stockbroker Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.

<TEXT>
Japan yesterday unveiled a market-opening package intended to increase
imports and reduce its record current account surplus with the aim of
reducing tension with the US.
The announcement followed US threats to impose trade sanctions after Japan,
during talks in Washington last month, rejected US calls to accept numerical
targets for imports.
Japanese officials said they had conceded most demands made in previous
trade negotiations except for setting such targets. The programme aimed to
boost the domestic economy and open Japan's markets by deregulation and
enhancing competition. It laid particular stress on four sectors:
telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance and motor parts, which the
US made priorities during talks in recent months.
Japan is to review past government procurement of medical and
telecommunications equipment, and the motor industry's purchases of parts
from foreign groups. US calls for deregulation of the insurance industry,
including easier access to licences, freeing of rates and lifting of
restrictions on broking, were also accommodated.
Standards, certification and inspection procedures on imported products such
as consumer electronics, foods, cars, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics will be
streamlined, while the Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly watchdog,
will be strengthened with the addition of further staff.
'A lot of it was pretty much expected, but it looks like it has some
positive aspects,' said Mr Bill Farrell, director of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Tokyo.
The Japanese government wants to cut its current account surplus to 2.8 per
cent of gross domestic product in the year to March 1995 from 3.1 per cent
the preceding year. Details of the macroeconomic measures, which include the
extension of income tax cuts and an increase in public expenditure, will be
announced in June before Premier Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Bill
Clinton in Naples for the Group of Seven summit.
In spite of enthusiasm among Japanese bureaucrats over the package, Tokyo's
financial markets reflected disappointment among investors. The yen jumped
on fears, later confirmed, that the US would not be satisfied, closing up
Y0.94 to Y103.80 against the dollar; the Tokyo stock market fell 1.2 per
cent to 19,709.74.
Paul Abrahams adds: Honda and Mazda yesterday followed the example of their
three main competitors when they announced plans to increase use of locally
made components at their American factories. The companies also promised to
increase imports into Japan.
Separately, the ministry of international trade and industry said it was
ending its voluntary limit on car exports to the US. The ministry said the
limits were no longer relevant since Japanese exports had been under the
ceilings set by the agreement since 1987.
The cap was introduced in 1981 to protect the US motor industry. About 1.54m
vehicles will be built by Japanese manufacturers in the US in 1994, the
first year they will exceed exports to the US of cars produced in Japan.
The announcements come as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
said Japan's motor exports in February had fallen 23.5 per cent in unit
terms compared with the same month last year. The figure was down 2.6 per
cent on the preceding month.
The car makers' undertakings follow sustained pressure from Washington on
Japan to increase use of US vehicle components to reduce Japan's trade
surplus. Only 2 per cent of motor parts are imported. The Japanese
government insists it is unable to interfere in private business.
Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi have recently revealed similar programmes,
committing themselves to increasing US parts purchases by more than Dollars
5.3bn by the financial year ending March 1998.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Patten promises HK will tackle rising home prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government is to develop a comprehensive set of proposals to
deal with the issue of rising house prices, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's
governor, said yesterday.
The governor said rising property prices were the top issue facing Hong
Kong. 'It is an exceptional problem and I think it will demand exceptional
measures,' he said.
Home ownership is one of the main aspirations of people in Hong Kong. But
analysts say that due to a government policy which restricts the supply of
land for residential development, prices have been kept artificially high.
In 1993, residential property prices rose by an average 28 per cent compared
with the previous year. At the luxury end of the market, prices were up by
more than 50 per cent.
Mr Patten, who left for Europe last night, said he had instructed senior
civil servants to develop proposals for action by the early summer. There
were no simple solutions to the problem, he declared.
Property market analysts said the problem of high residential property
prices could be solved by an increase in the supply of land. Mr Peter
Churchouse, managing director of Morgan Stanley, said: 'The government is
absolutely appalling in its land policy. It runs a high land-price policy
which has meant land prices are twice what they should be.'
High residential property prices have caused a storm of protest in Hong
Kong. Elected politicians have warned of unrest among frustrated home buyers
who cannot afford the price of entry into the residential market. A 600 sq
ft flat costs around HKDollars 2m (Pounds 173,460).
Property developers have also been accused of rigging the property market by
holding back from release completed homes. Prof Edward Chen, a member of Mr
Patten's Executive Council, and chairman of the Consumer Council, has
alleged developers are holding back up to 50 per cent of flats completed
last year.
Even Beijing has joined the debate, with officials criticising mainland
companies for speculating in the colony's property market. Mainland Chinese
investors are estimated to have invested up to a quarter of funds expended
on property in Hong Kong last year.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further contradictory data about the state of the Japanese economy emerged
yesterday. Although an index used to measure the economic outlook for the
next six months was up, unemployment rose sharply and sales in large stores
fell.
The latest report from the Economic Planning Agency showed the diffusion
index of economic indicators had risen to 60 in January, moving solidly
above the 50 mark, the dividing line between growth and contraction. The
index can be unreliable, since it indicated an economic recovery during the
first four months of 1993 which did not occur.
Nevertheless, housing loans increased sharply during February, as home
buyers took advantage of low interest rates. The number of loan applications
for owner-occupied homes rose 65.9 per cent compared with last February, the
Housing Loan Corporation said.
The pick-up in housing loans fed through to a small increase in sales of
furniture and household electrical goods at large retailers. But overall
sales at such outlets dropped 2.8 per cent in February compared with the
same period last year, according to the international trade and industry
ministry. This was the 21st month retail sales fell, and throws some doubt
on the likelihood of a consumer-led recovery.
Any upturn in the economy has yet to feed through to the jobs market. The
government yesterday said the unemployment rate last month had risen 0.2
percentage points to 2.9 per cent compared with January. The rate was the
highest since June 1987, while unemployment among women rose steeply to
reach an all-time high of 3.2 per cent.
Economists said employment normally lagged behind an economic recovery, but
the sharp rise in unemployment was a disappointment after it had fallen in
January for the first time in 22 months.
The number of people without jobs reached 1.94m in February, an increase of
370,000 (23.6 per cent), compared with the same month last year. Much of the
fall was caused by a drop in manufacturing jobs, down 480,000 since last
year. A rise in the number employed in construction and services failed to
offset the decline.
The continuing weakness of the jobs market was confirmed by a fall in the
ratio of employment available to job seekers, which dropped 0.02 percentage
points to 0.65. The rate peaked in March 1991 at 1.45. The number of jobs
available fell 1.5 per cent; the number of applicants rose 2 per cent.

FT  30 MAR 94 / South Korean president seeks to cool row with North
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's President Kim Young-sam yesterday called for greater
diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis over North Korea's refusal to open
its nuclear sites to international inspection.
His call came as North Korea said it had been 'driven into a corner' by US
and international demands for full nuclear inspections, and reiterated it
would withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) if US
pressure continued.
Speaking after talks with China's Premier Li Peng, Mr Kim appeared to
support Beijing's call for patience in dealing with North Korea. 'Through
consultation and dialogue I believe we can solve this problem smoothly
without any difficulties,' he said.
Mr Kim has sent his foreign minister, Mr Han Sung-joo, to the US to press
for heightened diplomatic efforts. Mr Han would also visit Russia early next
month for consultations on the nuclear issue, he said.
China opposes US efforts at the UN to set a deadline for Pyongyang to comply
with international demands for access to its nuclear sites for International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.
Beijing has indicated it might accept a statement by the Security Council
president calling for North Korean co-operation, but only if it was couched
in general terms and did not foreshadow economic sanctions.
China's foreign ministry said on Monday that dialogue was 'the only
effective way' to settle the issue. China is apprehensive of action that
might place its unpredictable neighbour in a corner.
Mr Kim used his visit to Beijing to urge China to play a more active role in
seeking to wean North Korea from its self-imposed isolation. 'We have never
wanted the North to be isolated and will spare no effort to help Pyongyang
join the international community as a responsible member,' Mr Kim said at
Beijing university yesterday.
This approach mirrors one advocated by China. Chinese officials have said
repeatedly that the west and especially the US should make gestures towards
North Korea, such as steps towards diplomatic recognition.
Mr Han said in Beijing before leaving for Washington that although China
opposed sanctions against Pyongyang, it did not reject Seoul's view that
pressure on North Korea could be increased later if required.
Mr Han denied there was a wide gap between China's position and that of the
US and South Korea. 'There's only a difference in the intensity of
preference,' he said.
South Korean officials have warned that sanctions against Pyongyang without
China's co-operation would be ineffective. China supplies the bulk of North
Korea's oil. It also ships foodstuffs.
China has criticised US and South Korean plans to resume the Team Spirit
joint military exercises suspended last year in an effort to encourage North
Korea to be more co-operative. Beijing has also counselled against the
deployment of US Patriot missiles in South Korea.
These criticisms are regarded by western officials in Beijing as
'pro-forma'. China is thought to want to continue giving the appearance of
supporting North Korea on some issues in the hope that ultimately this may
bolster its leverage in Pyongyang.
Meanwhile in Bangkok, in a rare briefing by a North Korean official, Mr Li
Do Sop, Pyongyang's ambassador to Thailand, denied his government wanted to
build nuclear weapons, saying it had neither the capacity nor the money to
do so.
Explaining why North Korea has barred IAEA inspectors from fully examining
all its nuclear sites, Mr Li said this was a response to outside pressure.
'They forced us too much, they drove us into a corner so much that we
reacted,' he said, calling North Koreans the 'victims' of US hostility. 'The
US's pressure-bound machinations will result in driving us completely out of
the NPT.'
Mr Li avoided the bellicose language of some earlier North Korean statements
and described his country's military posture as completely defensive. Asked
why his country had developed long-range missiles, he replied: 'We have to
increase our defensive capacity to defend our sovereignty and our dignity.'
He insisted the nuclear issue should be resolved as part of a package deal
agreed by Washington and Pyongyang last month that included an IAEA
inspection, a proposal for the exchange of envoys between North and South
Korea, and the suspension of the US-South Korean 'Team Spirit' military
exercise. Each side now accuses the other of breaking the agreement; the US
and South Korea are planning to go ahead with Team Spirit.
'The US does not have real intentions to solve nuclear problems through
negotiations or talks,' Mr Li said. 'It is their intention to stifle our
republic, destroy our republic.' He ruled out a military first strike by
North Korea, but added: 'If they kill one of us, then one of them should
also be killed.'
On the threat of economic sanctions against North Korea, Mr Li said his
country was already under economic pressure from the US and Japan and was
accustomed to self-sufficiency.
'The people have no worries about their housing, clothes or their food, or
any worries about medical care,' he said. 'At this moment, our people are
saying they are happy.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Hebron security talks held in secret

<TEXT>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met secretly in Cairo last night, in a
continuing effort to finalise security arrangements for Palestinians in
Hebron, which the PLO has insisted are the precondition for returning to
full peace talks.
PLO officials said before the talks they did not expect to announce any
agreement before today. They refused to call the talks 'negotiations',
saying their delegates were simply 'receiving answers from the Israeli
government'.
The PLO and Israel agreed last week in principle to the deployment of
international observers and Palestinian police in Hebron but were at odds
over the number to be deployed and rules of deployment. Israel has said it
will permit only 60 international observers and a few dozen Palestinian
police; the PLO insisted on 150 observers and 400 police.
PLO negotiators kept their Israeli counterparts waiting for over an hour
before the talks started. They were awaiting clearance from Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO chairman based in Tunis, who had convened senior officials
to discuss whether to stall the talks in protest at the shooting of six
members of his own Fatah faction in Gaza on Tuesday.
The two sides are likely to proceed as quickly as possible on resolving the
Hebron issue before moving directly to a resumption of full talks on Israeli
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. These talks have been suspended since an
Israeli settler killed over 30 Palestinians in Hebron on February 25.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, seemed downhearted yesterday,
speaking of the 'many obstacles' to be overcome before talks could resume,
and ruling out any prospect of an early summit between Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
prime minister, and Mr Arafat.
The Israeli team, last night briefing Mr Rabin on the Tunis talks, ruled out
PLO calls for the removal of Jewish settlers from Hebron. Most Israeli
ministers favour evacuation of the settlers, but Mr Rabin has been adamant
that, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed by Israel and
the PLO in Washington last September, the issue of settlements remains off
the agenda for at least two years.

Prosecution and defence in the Singapore trial of five men charged with
breaking the republic's official secrets act by disclosing a government
economic growth estimate have finished presenting their cases. A verdict is
expected later this week or early next.
The five, two financial journalists and three economists, are accused of
colluding in the disclosure of the 4.6 per cent second-quarter growth figure
for 1992, which was published in the Singapore Business Times, the
republic's leading financial daily.
Among the accused are Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics
department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de
facto central bank, and Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times.
The prosecution has argued that Mr Shanmugaratnam disclosed the growth
estimate to two economists working with local securities houses who then
passed on the figure to the Business Times.
If found guilty the five accused face a maximum two years' jail or a
SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 860) fine, or both.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Aids drug price war in Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome has cut the price of its Aids treatment AZT by 30 per cent in
Portugal because of competition from a Portuguese company marketing a
cheaper version in a challenge to Wellcome's worldwide patents, according to
Portuguese officials.
Mr Jose Fleming Torrinha, director of the Sao Joao Hospital in Oporto, said
Wellcome had made the cut in a bid for a contract to supply the hospital
with 6,000 250mg capsules of Retrovir, Wellcome's version of AZT and its
second biggest selling drug.
He said a small Portuguese company, Farma APS Productos Farmaceuticos, had
lodged a rival bid to supply a Canadian-made version of AZT at 33 per cent
below Wellcome's previous price. The hospital has not yet decided between
the two proposals.
Wellcome said it was 'amazed that Portugal as a member of the European Union
is not prepared to respect our intellectual property rights in relation to
Retrovir'. It would take every action possible to protect those rights.
The company said it believed failure to respect intellectual property rights
would hinder development of innovative medicines.
Farma APS is marketing Apo-Zidovudine, a form of AZT manufactured by Apotex
of Canada, which is already selling the drug in some Canadian provinces,
Senegal, South Africa, Brazil and Venezuela. This is the company's first
venture into a European market.
The Portuguese government has authorised sale of Apo-Zidovudine on the
grounds that AZT is a drug in the public domain and that Wellcome's
pioneering application of Retrovir to treat Aids did not give it the right
to prohibit sale of other versions.
In addition, Portugal's patent law on drugs protects only manufacturing
processes, not the chemical substance. This could make it more difficult for
Wellcome to prove its patents have been infringed. Wellcome has been in a
series of patent disputes with companies, including Apotex, over the right
to sell AZT. So far, Wellcome has won a case in the US and has actions
outstanding in Canada and France.
A 30 per cent reduction in the price of AZT would save the Portuguese state
more than Es150m (Pounds 580,000) a year, based on total sales of about
Es500m in 1993. Retrovir sales worldwide were worth Pounds 248m in 1993.
Wellcome is proposing to sell Retrovir to the Oporto hospital at Es423.5 a
250mg capsule compared with Es605 previously. Farma APS proposes to sell
Apo-Zidovudine at Es405 a capsule. Portuguese hospitals bought 1m capsules
of Retrovir in 1993. In Portugal, AZT is sold only directly to hospitals,
not through pharmacies.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Mobile phone row in UAE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile phone dealers in the United Arab Emirates face losses running into
millions of dollars because of a precipitate decision by the country's state
telecommunications monopoly to ban new customers from its mobile phone
network.
Would-be subscribers in the UAE have been told to wait for the launch of a
new, more expensive digital cellular network later this year, although the
existing analogue network is believed to have spare capacity.
Etisalat, the UAE's state telecoms monopoly, announced the ban in a
newspaper advertisement early last month.
According to Middle East Mobile magazine, the announcement has left mobile
phone dealers with useless stock worth around Dollars 5.4m for the analogue
network.
Dealers are threatening to sue Etisalat for compensation.
Two digital networks, built to the pan-European GSM standard, are under
construction in the UEA, one by AT&amp;T, the US supplier, the other by a
consortium of Motorola of the US and Siemens of Germany. Both will be
operated by Etisalat.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US waves flag for workers' rights in WTO -
Negotiators encounter some bumps along the road to Marrakesh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Today's meeting of top trade negotiators was meant to tie up proceedings
before the Marrakesh meeting on April 12-15 when the Uruguay Round accords
on global trade liberalisation will be signed.
Since concluding the round last December, there have been three months of
checking and polishing. Negotiators were due formally to nod through the 28
Uruguay Round texts (550 pages), 81 country tariff schedules (15,000 pages),
95 services schedules (2,500 pages), three (short) accompanying ministerial
decisions and a political declaration.
It was, of course, too good to be true. Last week, the US set the stage for
ill tempers at Marrakesh by insisting that worker rights are put on the
agenda of the new World Trade Organisation, due to succeed Gatt next year.
Washington says it will not approve the ministerial declaration unless it
contains a reference to early consideration of the relationship of the
trading system and 'internationally recognised labour standards'.
This move, which flouts an understanding among negotiators not to raise new
issues before Marrakesh, has irritated even trading partners sympathetic to
the idea, such as the European Union. Developing countries, which are
opposed to any discussion of worker rights in Gatt or the WTO, are incensed.
This was almost certainly foreseen by Washington. However, the Clinton
administration is under pressure from US labour unions to take a muscular
stance against 'social dumping' - the loss of trade, investment and jobs to
low-wage countries.
Washington's interest in the issue is also long-standing. The US tried
unsuccessfully to put worker rights on the Uruguay Round agenda and later,
equally unsuccessfully, proposed a Gatt working party 'to explore the
possible relationship between internationally recognised labour standards
and trade'.
More recently, international pressure has grown from trade unions and
politicians for a Gatt 'social clause' to give teeth to the labour standards
set by the International Labour Organisation. Gatt rules already permit
countries to prohibit goods made with prison labour, but otherwise are
silent on the subject.
The ILO's director-general, Mr Michel Hansenne, notes that there is an
important distinction, often blurred, between the use of trade sanctions to
enforce universal or 'absolute' human rights - where the concern is or
should be humanitarian - and the use of sanctions against countries alleged
to be competing unfairly through low wages or working conditions.
Almost all those arguing for a Gatt social clause say they are not trying to
remove the comparative advantage of low cost nations. Sir Leon Brittan, EU
trade commissioner, says the focus should be on the ILO's core human rights
conventions relating to child exploitation, slavery and other forced labour,
and freedom to form trade unions.
Trade unions have pressed for a broader social clause covering minimum work
safety standards and non-discrimination in the workplace.
US officials, for their part, remain deliberately vague. 'We don't have a
defined agenda or set views,' said one Geneva-based US official this week.
'But we do have a legitimate interest in discussing the issue with trading
partners.'
Developing countries are suspicious that industrialised nations are using a
professed concern over human rights to cloak straightforwardly protectionist
aims.
Their doubts are shared by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director general. In
a robust speech this month he argued that drastic trade remedies against
so-called social dumping were the wrong approach.
'Such politicisation of trade policy-making turns it into the equivalent of
breaking off diplomatic relations or suspending aircraft landing rights,' he
said. Introducing it into the co-operative WTO framework 'would place the
system at immediate risk of collapse.'
Behind these words lies the fear that the fragile North-South unity over
trade forged in the Uruguay Round could be shattered, posing a threat to
other issues on the WTO agenda. Developing countries were won over to talks
on trade and the environment only after they were persuaded that they too
had much to gain from coherent multilateral rules based on keeping the
trading system open and non-discriminatory.
Mr Sutherland is keen on working towards a future agreement on foreign
investment rules, where he sees a common interest between rich and poor
nations, and for the organisation to become more involved in questions of
trade and development.
The obstacles to putting trade and worker rights on the WTO agenda look
formidable. Without an incentive to make discussing the subject worthwhile,
developing countries have every reason to keep saying no.

FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: EU declares end to row over bananas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday announced that its long-running dispute
with Latin American countries over banana imports to the European Union was
over.
It said the EU would increase its current 2m-tonne annual quota for Latin
American bananas to 2.1m tonnes this year and 2.2m tonnes next year.
In return, Costa Rica has joined Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela in
agreeing not to pursue its complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade about the EU's preferential banana trade with former colonies in
Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP).
Guatemala is pressing its complaint, which has been upheld by a Gatt panel,
but the Commission decided to go ahead with the deal anyway since Guatemala
accounts for only 1.5 per cent of the market.
The deal still has to be approved by member states, some of whom, led by
Germany, are unhappy with the Commission's handling of the dispute and want
EU banana trade to be more open.
Germany, which had special permission under the Treaty of Rome to allow free
access for Latin American bananas to its market, has taken a case to the
European Court against the new EU banana regime introduced last July.
It disputes member states' right to have approved the regime, which imposed
EU-wide import tariffs on Latin American bananas, by a qualified majority.
Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, warned agriculture ministers
meeting in Brussels yesterday that failure to back the deal with the Latin
Americans could endanger the Uruguay Round Gatt deal, due to be signed in
Marrakesh next month.
Under yesterday's deal, the Commission agreed to reduce the tariff charged
on Latin American bananas within the quota to Ecu 75 a tonne from Ecu 100.
This was a concession to Costa Rica, one of the biggest suppliers to the EU.
It is granting specific quotas to the four countries based on their past
share of the EU market - 23.4 per cent to Costa Rica, 21 per cent to
Colombia, 3 per cent to Nicaragua and 2 per cent to Venezuela.
The governments of those countries will also be able to grant export
licences, a move aimed at encouraging producer co-operatives to sell direct
to the EU for a better price, rather than through the multinationals.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Zedillo succeeds murdered Mexico presidential frontrunner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a former budget and education minister, has been chosen
to replace the murdered Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as the presidential
candidate of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Mr Zedillo managed Mr Colosio's campaign until the latter was assassinated
in the northern town of Tijuana last Wednesday. With Mexico's governing
party in power for the past 65 years, and well ahead of the opposition in
opinion polls, Mr Zedillo becomes strong favourite to win the presidential
election set for August 21 and succeed President Carlos Salinas.
Mr Zedillo, 42, is a US-trained economist who represents the technocratic,
pro-economic reform wing of the party. He is a protege of Mr Salinas, and is
expected to gain support from the allies of Mr Colosio in the party, and
foreign-trained bureaucrats in the government. His nomination sends a clear
signal of continuity with the economic policies of President Salinas.
However, he has never held elective office, and his views on social and
political issues are hardly known. He does not inspire much confidence among
party traditionalists, who consider him a sober and unimaginative
technocrat. Mr Zedillo was mentioned as a possible presidential contender
last year but was passed over because of his lack of political experience
and party support.
In a speech yesterday Mr Zedillo sought to unite the party around his
candidacy by projecting himself as the heir to Mr Colosio. He fully embraced
Mr Colosio's political programme, and signalled that he intends to
capitalise on the enormous sympathy felt for the slain candidate both in and
out of the party.
'The PRI does not begin a campaign, but continues one,' he said. 'We already
have a precise diagnosis of the national problems that were elaborated with
vision and lucidity by Luis Donaldo Colosio.'
Yesterday Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the PRI, formally announced
Mr Zedillo's candidacy, soon after taking himself out of contention. Mr
Ortiz Arana had been Mr Zedillo's main rival for the nomination.
In Mexican politics the president selects the PRI candidate after
consultations with party leaders in a process known as the dedazo - or the
pointing of the finger. President Salinas appears to have followed tradition
and chosen Mr Zedillo just as he chose Mr Colosio.
Mr Zedillo is from modest origins from the northern state of Baja
California. He briefly studied at the University of Bradford, England,
earned a PhD in economics from Yale University, then worked at Mexico's
central bank. In 1988 he became budget minister at the age of 36, and in
1992 was appointed education minister.
As education minister he oversaw important reforms that gave states greater
control over education policy. However, he was widely criticised for putting
out new school textbooks that revised the nationalist interpretation of
Mexican history.
Despite misgivings about Mr Zedillo's political talents, there had been no
obvious alternative to him. Other eligible rivals either lacked government
experience, or were not viewed as loyal followers of Mr Salinas. Candidates
in the government were taken out of contention by Mexico's constitution,
which prohibits ministers and governors from being nominated as presidential
candidate six months before the election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in consumer confidence this month to the highest level in
nearly four years yesterday indicated that the US economy is again surging
ahead after bad weather and other distortions temporarily slowed growth at
the start of the year.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its consumer
confidence index rose nearly 7 points to 86.7 in March, the highest reading
since July 1990, at the peak of the previous business cycle.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported early signs of a rebound in
housing after disruptions caused by severe winter storms and the Californian
earthquake. New homes sales rose 1.9 per cent last month and by 8 per cent
in the year to February. This followed an erratic 22.5 per cent decline in
January.
The confidence figures are the first clear sign that the economy may be back
on the steep upward growth trend established in the second half of last year
when real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5 per
cent.
Analysts are now keenly awaiting payroll employment figures for March, due
out this Friday, for confirmation of faster growth. The consensus view is
that about 250,000 new jobs were created this month, well above the average
for last year. But some analysts are looking for an increase of 300,000.
If economic data for March do confirm rapid economic growth, the US Federal
Reserve is likely to come under renewed pressure in financial markets to
raise interest rates again. Last week the Fed signalled a second
quarter-point increase in short-term rates to 3.5 per cent.
The consumer confidence index has risen 26 points in the past five months
and is now at a level which, over the years, has foreshadowed an
increasingly strong economy, according to Mr Fabian Linden of the Conference
Board.
A sub-index measuring consumers' expectations of economic conditions over
the next six months had risen particularly sharply - from 84.4 to 93.0.
The survey also revealed that most US consumers expect interest rates to
rise further: 70 per cent of respondents said rates would go up again
against against less than half six months ago.
The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households.
The rise in new home sales last month mainly reflected a sharp rebound on
the west coast following disruption caused by the Los Angeles earthquake in
January. Sales in the west rose 28 per cent after a 22 per cent decline in
January. Sales in the northeast, midwest and south fell again last month,
but by less in most regions than in January.
Most analysts expect a solid national increase in new home sales this month,
reflecting more clement weather and mortgage rates that are still low by
historical standards.

<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is expected to
resign today in order to run for the presidency later this year. His likely
successor is Mr Rubens Ricupero, a respected diplomat and former ambassador
in Washington.
Mr Cardoso has been strongly pressured by his party, the Brazilian Social
Democrats (PSDB), to run for the presidency, but he is leaving the finance
ministry at a critical moment. An anti-inflation plan he has negotiated
through Congress is not yet fully in force and may be undermined once he
leaves. According to Brazil's constitution, he must resign by April 2 to run
in the October polls.
Financial markets reacted calmly to the expected transition. Mr Ricupero was
not Mr Cardoso's first choice as his replacement, but the former ambassador
has said he supports Mr Cardoso's economic measures. He is also friendly
with several of the leading economists in Mr Cardoso's team.
Mr Ricupero is well versed in economic affairs from his stint in Washington,
where he was involved in Brazil's negotiations with the international
financial community, and in trade matters. He was replaced as ambassador
last year by President Itamar Franco who was annoyed at international
reaction to a massacre of street children in Rio de Janeiro. Since then Mr
Ricupero has worked as minister of the environment with responsibility for
the Amazon.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Clinton climbs back in poll ratings
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's exposition of the Whitewater affair at last
Thursday's press conference has produced an immediate rise in public
support, according to two polls released yesterday.
The same surveys also showed a public increasingly believing that the media
is paying too much attention to the first family's financial dealings in
Arkansas when he was governor and to the allegations that senior
administration officials have sought to frustrate investigations into them.
The recent poll trend has seen Mr Clinton's approval rating slipping into
the mid-40s. However, the Washington Post-ABC survey, conducted last
weekend, had it back up to 57 per cent, a 10-point rise compared to last
week. The CNN-Gallup-USA Today poll recorded a more modest two-point rise to
52 per cent.
The first poll found 54 per cent approving of the way the president was
handling Whitewater, up from 32 per cent just three weeks before. Some 60
per cent thought he was 'mainly telling the truth' while 55 per cent thought
he had done nothing illegal and 51 per cent thought the same of Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
The second poll, with slightly different questions, still detected a high
level of public concern. Only 36 per cent answered he had done 'nothing
wrong,' but this was up five points in three weeks.
The Post-ABC poll found 71 per cent believing the media was paying too much
attention to Whitewater, while the second survey put that level at 55 per
cent. It also found 54 per cent persuaded that the Republicans were
'overreacting' to Whitewater.
Some news organisations have found themselves in controversy over specific
aspects of their coverage of the affair. Newsweek magazine seemed yesterday
close to an apology to Professor Marvin Chirelstein of Columbia University
for possibly misrepresenting his views on the Clintons' tax returns,
released last week. He said he was 'simply outraged and humiliated' by a
'biased' article in which he is quoted as saying Mrs Clinton must have
benefited from a 'sweetheart deal' in her commodities trading in the late
1970s.
Mr Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater counsel, said he was 'very upset
and disturbed' by a cover story in Time magazine, which quoted sources on
his team in its article on the role of Mr George Stephanopoulos, senior
presidential aide, in the Whitewater affair. Such contacts, he said, had not
taken place, but Time said it did not make up any quotes. The magazine was
also criticised for its cover picture on the grounds it was taken in
November, before Whitewater was a major story.
Mr Stephanopoulos has admitted his anger on discovering that federal
regulators had hired Mr Jay Stephens, a Republican former US attorney
frequently critical of Mr Clinton, to investigate the failed Arkansas
savings and loan institution implicated in Whitewater. But his reaction has
been defended by many in Washington. Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House,
sarcastically suggested those who found anything wrong with it had invented
a new standard of public behaviour - 'the appearance of the appearance of
impropriety.'

Argentina's President Carlos Menem has sacked the president of the national
securities commission (CNV), claiming he had breached the confidentiality of
his post.
Mr Martin Redrado had vowed he would not resign, insisting he was legally
entitled to tenure until 1996 to insulate him from political interference.
Mr Redrado's dismissal was precipitated by his criticism of proposals by
Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston of the US to handle the sale of Dollars
720m-worth (Pounds 493m) of stock in the privatised oil company YPF held by
Argentine pensioners. He had attacked the commission rates for the sale.

<TEXT>
Inflation in Switzerland fell to an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in March,
its lowest level since June 1987. Many economists believe the rate will sink
below 1 per cent in the next couple of months, down from an annualised peak
of 6.6 per cent in June 1991. An excessively loose monetary policy in the
late 1980s forced the central bank to push up short-term interest rates to
over 9 per cent by early 1992, provoking indexed rent and public service
price rises. The indexing is now working in reverse. The consumer price
index was unchanged in March from February. The Federal Statistics Office
said domestically produced goods were 0.1 per cent dearer and imported goods
0.2 per cent cheaper.
Denmark's current account surplus rose to DKr34.7bn (Pounds 3.63bn) in 1993
from DKr28.8bn in 1992.
New orders in Germany's engineering and plant construction sector were
unchanged in February compared with a year earlier, with a 6 per cent
decline in domestic orders offset by a 6 per cent increase in foreign
orders.
French industrialists surveyed by the national statistics office, Insee,
during March said activity had picked up sharply in recent months and they
were 'resolutely optimistic' on the outlook for production.

Public confidence in the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, crashed
by 12 percentage points in March to stand at just 40 per cent, according to
an opinion poll published yesterday, his first anniversary in office. The
poll by the CSA institute for the Roman Catholic weekly newspaper, La Vie,
was the latest evidence of a sharp decline in public approval of the
conservative Gaullist prime minister following a wave of youth unrest. It
showed Mr Balladur's confidence rating had fallen below that of the
socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, who rose by 6 points to 45 per

opposition against President Milan Kucan of Slovenia, a former communist who

the two sides remain far apart in their political demands.

   By VIRGINIA MARSH

<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Romanian parliament yesterday approved a law introducing a tax on land
ownership, which the Propact farmers' union said would create social unrest.
Although most agricultural land is now worked by private farmers, only 15
per cent of the 5.1m private landowners have received full titles to
property returned under a 1991 act. This has prevented them from using their
land as collateral to raise capital for seeds and equipment. Opposition MPs,
who boycotted the vote on the law, said the tax was illegal and that they
intended to appeal to the constitutional court. They said tax could be
levied on production but not on estimates of production from a piece of
land, as provided in the law. The tax was a way of discriminating against
private individual landowners, they said. Agriculture companies, such as
state farms, will continue to pay tax on profits rather than the new tax.
Passage of the law clears the way for presentation of the much-delayed 1994
budget and for International Monetary Fund approval of a Dollars 700m loan
package.

The new Slovak government has blocked the privatisation of 13 projects

privatisation minister, Mr Milan Janicina, said yesterday.
Mr Vladimir Meciar's government, ousted in a no-confidence vote on March 11,
had approved 45 direct sales of state-owned companies. Many were approved
after Mr Meciar lost the vote and before the new administration took over,
government officials said.
On March 18, Mr Rudolf Filkus, the new finance minister, blocked the account
of the National Property Fund, effectively stopping any transfers of shares
held by the agency which administers the privatisation of state-held
enterprises. 'The projects in question are legally and technically
imperfect,' he said. However, some of the 13 companies would be awarded to
the original buyers approved by Mr Meciar's government 'when purified of
legal and technical imperfections', he said. Mr Janicina added that some
projects lacked authorisation by the anti-monopoly bureau and other legal
requirements. Others undervalued property.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Turkey shaken by Islamic party's wins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's Islamic-based Refah party (RP) yesterday delivered a decisive
challenge to the country's mainstream secular parties, with widespread gains
in the weekend's municipal elections, including dramatic wins in both
Istanbul, the biggest city, and Ankara, the
capital.
The RP, campaigning on a anti-corruption platform, had last night won 28 of
the country's 76 municipalities, with almost all the votes counted. The
party had taken 18 per cent of the national vote, twice the votes won in
local elections in 1989. Mr Necmettin Erbakan, the RP leader, claimed
yesterday the result meant that 66 per cent of Turkey's 60m population was
now ruled by RP local administration.
Westernised Turks have always maintained that RP's brand of radical Islamic
policies would never win broad appeal. The RP was helped in part by the
continuing split in Turkey's traditional conservative parties. However, the
result has clearly shaken the secularist establishment.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister - whose True Path party narrowly won
the national vote with 22 per cent - immediately called for a new alliance
of the right, signalling the growing alarm in Ankara at the Islamic vote.
According to one expert, the support for the RP, if repeated in a general
election, would give the party at least 100 seats in the 450-seat
parliament. The RP currently has 40 MPs in Ankara.
In an Istanbul office lined with books on American government, Mr Abdullah
Gul, a senior adviser to Mr Erbakan, projected the RP leader yesterday as
the model of reasonableness. 'We are something like the Christian Democrats
in Europe,' he says.
This week, for the first time, Turks will have a chance to test this claim.
As the map on the front page of the daily Hurriyet newspaper graphically
illustrated yesterday, the party controls a swathe of city halls all the way
from Istanbul to Erzerum on the old Soviet border.
For radical Moslems, Istanbul is a particularly intoxicating prize. The city
is an Islamic holyplace. It is ingrained with Christian history - almost a
byword for the western decadence and spiritual sterility which fanatics say
was unleashed when Kemal Ataturk created the secular Turkish republic in the
1920s.
Among Istanbul's residents yesterday RP's victory was just sinking in. Would
the mayor ban alcohol? Would the RP be able to close cinemas and clubs in
the interest of public morality? Would international funding for the city's
badly needed infrastructure projects dry up?
Mr Tayyip Erdogan, the victorious mayoral candidate, promised to build a
mosque in Taksim Square, the city's main shopping district. He said he would
close the city brothels, and create the world's biggest conference centre.
Nationally, the RP's vote was distorted somewhat by the withdrawal of the
radical Kurdish-based Democracy party, which allowed the RP a free run in
the Kurdish-speaking south-east. However, the party has made sweeping
advances in other areas. In Trabzon, for example, the RP is said to have won
over local women by promising to send home the so-called 'Natashas', the
Russian and Georgian prostitutes who have turned the ancient port city into
the Bangkok of the Black Sea.
Deliberately courting the moderate Islamic constituency, the party was often
fronted by attractive, unveiled women dentists and other professionals on an
anti-corruption platform. But while some RP leaders have been prominent in
Turkish politics since the 1960s, the party remains largely untested in
government. It is anti-Zionist, anti-Nato and opposes Turkey's efforts to
join the European Union.
In many ways, Mr Erbakan hardly fits the ogre that most secular Turks
conjure up when they think of Islamic extremists. But the RP's real
advantage is that it is the only grassroots party in the country. The other
parties are all centred on figureheads. Mr Erbakan has tasted power before.
In the late 1970s, he was deputy prime minister in a number of disastrous
national governments which eventually led to the military's intervention in
1980.
Everyone is waiting now to see how the RP grapples with the gargantuan
problems of running Istanbul. As the former social democrat administration
discovered after a series of corruption scandals, the city is a graveyard
for political reputations. Many secular Turks, who still believe that they
are Turkey's silent majority, are hoping the RP will also fail.

Kazakhstan announced on Monday, the two states will be establishing a joint
enterprise to conduct oil drilling in Kazakhstan's part of the Caspian Sea,
it emerged yesterday. The agreements also gave Russia full territorial
rights over Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, which was the ex-Soviet
Union's only launchpad for manned space flights, at a rent of Dollars 115m

Meanwhile, Russia dropped its demand that Kazakhstan grant ethnic Russians
dual citizenship. Steve LeVine, Moscow.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Krajina ceasefire talks progress: European News Digest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Croatian government officials and leaders of Krajina, the breakaway Serb
state, yesterday made headway in crucial talks on a ceasefire, which Serb
leaders said could avert another war in the region.
Negotiators held out the hope that the two sides might reach an agreement
late last night. Speaking by telephone from the Russian embassy in Zagreb,
the Croatian capital, where the two sides met for the second time in a week,
Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of Krajina, said: 'The chances are
50-50 that we reach an agreement. The atmosphere is very tense, but so much
is at stake.' However, the two sides remain far apart in their political
demands.
Serb leaders, backed by the Yugoslav army, are insisting on independence for
their breakaway state, carved out during a six-month war, while the Croatian
authorities are pressing the international community to bring Krajina, which
cuts Croatia in two, under Zagreb's control.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has reportedly suggested trading
parts of the Serb-held land in exchange for the phasing out of UN sanctions
on what remains of Yugoslavia. Laura Silber, Belgrade.

Ukrainian voters were confronted with a fresh obstacle to the election of a
new legislature yesterday, when the government announced a complicated
procedure for the run-off elections which must take place by April 10. The
procedural complication will make it more difficult for voters to elect a
viable legislature.
Unexpectedly high voter turnout in the Sunday elections threatened to thwart
Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk's hopes to introduce direct presidential
rule after what he forecast would be a turnout too low to legally elect a
new parliament.
By confusing the procedure for the run-off votes, which must take place in
90 per cent of the seats, Mr Kravchuk's government appears to be looking for
another way to prevent the emergence of an effective legislature.
Mr Ivan Yemets, the chief election officer, announced yesterday that the
crucial run-off ballots need not, as previously believed, be held
simultaneously on April 10, but may be held as early as April 2, depending
on the wishes of the regional administration. Holding the vote at different
times in different regions of the country could confuse voters.
Mr Kravchuk, who toyed with plans to introduce direct presidential rule on
the eve of the elections, has reason to fear last Sunday's vote.
Unexpectedly, 75 per cent of Ukrainians showed up at the polls and initial
results suggest they voted for a legislature more independent and
reform-minded than its communist-dominated predecessor. Voters also gave a
powerful mandate to two leading Ukrainian political figures, and possible
contenders for the presidency.
Mr Ivan Pliushch, the out-going speaker of parliament, and Mr Leonid Kuchma,
the former prime minister, both won seats with strong majorities and have
insisted that the presidential elections be held on schedule in June.
Mr Bohdan Krawchenko, the Canadian director of Ukraine's main school of
public administration, predicts the new parliament will be evenly divided
between centrists, national-democrats, and communists. He also believes
economic reforms will now be forced to the top of Ukraine's political
agenda. 'The power vacuum at the heart of Ukraine is gone,' he said. The
remaining power-struggle, regardless of how the conflict between the
president and parliament is resolved, is that between Ukraine's disparate
regions.
Crimea, which elected a separatist president in January, voted strongly for
closer ties with Moscow and voters in eastern Ukraine endorsed more economic
integration with Russia. However, the polls in these regions have no legal
weight and both Crimeans and eastern Ukrainians appeared content to wait
until a new parliament is convened before pressing their demands.

<TEXT>
Northern League leaders put a brave face yesterday on evidence that more
moderate supporters had deserted to their ally, Forza Italia, insisting they
would not abandon their federalist principles, writes John Simkins in Milan.
Although Mr Umberto Bossi's League approximately doubled its tally of
senators and lower house deputies from the 79 elected in 1992, its success
in the first-past-the-post seats owes much to Forza Italia support. Their
pact favoured the League in the division of seats, allowing it, as the more
established party, to nominate 70 per cent of candidates.
Respective support showed itself in the 25 per cent of lower house seats
reserved for proportional representation, where parties stood under their
individual banners. In these the League took 11 seats compared with Forza
Italia's 16 in northern seats.
Mr Massimo Scaglione, one of 12 League senators elected in Piedmont compared
with one for Forza Italia, said he was 'very satisfied' with his party's
performance.
He backed Mr Bossi in his campaign attacks on Forza Italia which, according
to the League leader, emerged out of the old political system that the
League was trying to dismantle.
'It is much better to speak as he does. Bread is bread and wine is wine and
this is the frank style of the League,' he said.
However, Mr Marco Formentini, the League mayor of Milan, accepted that the
'soft' face of Forza Italia had attracted League moderates. 'The League has
a rigorous programme which it is difficult to accept because it means
changing the state and switching from a central system to a federal one,' he
said. Forza Italia would accept change was necessary once it had to confront
the country's problems in government.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Voting system leaves small groups in cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's victorious right was yesterday claiming that its electoral success
was based on overwhelming nationwide support for the alliance of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the federalist Northern League and the far-right
National Alliance.
But the Progressive Alliance of seven left-wing parties said the result
showed Italy had split into three clear parts - the north, centre and south
 -with parts of the centre of the country, a traditional stronghold for
communist and socialist voters, seeing off the challenge of the right. In
Umbria, for example, Progressives were elected in all the
first-past-the-post seats, while in Tuscany, the left won 80 per cent of the
seats.
What was clear, however, was that Italy's complex new voting laws had
produced a parliament shorn of many of the smaller parties which used to win
seats under the old electoral system.
The reformed Socialist party, the Sicily-based clean government movement, La
Rete, the Greens and the centre-left Democratic Alliance all failed to
attract more than 4 per cent of the votes. As a result, they will not be
entitled to any of the 155 seats in the 630-seat lower house which were
'reserved' for smaller parties under the proportional system.
Some candidates should enter parliament under the first-past-the-post
system, however. All four parties were part of the Progressive Alliance,
which instead has had to rely on the stronger performance of its main
components, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and the hardline
candidates of Reconstructed Communism.
Mr Giuseppe Ayala, leader of the Democratic Alliance - which had attracted
the support of left-leaning figures from business and the arts - admitted
yesterday that the small parties had made a serious tactical error in
conducting separate campaigns for support under the proportional system.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, formerly Italy's environment commissioner in
Brussels and spokesman for the Greens, claimed that the small parties could
not compete with the televisual power of their larger opponents.
The most impressive victories for the parties of the right came in the
south, notably in Sicily. The leader of La Rete, Mr Leoluca Orlando, who
became mayor of Palermo as recently as November with 75 per cent of the
vote, had to watch while National Alliance and Forza Italia candidates,
including film director Franco Zeffirelli, captured all but a handful of the
Sicilian seats.
But Mr Giuseppe Chiarante, PDS leader in the Senate, warned that the new
voting system risked 'leading Italian democracy up a dangerous blind alley'
which would make it difficult for the right to govern the country.
The new rules also punished, as expected, the centre parties of the Pact for
Italy. Most notably, Mr Mario Segni, who left the Christian Democrats and
successfully pushed for a referendum on voting reform last year, has found
himself in the embarrassing situation of having to take up one of the
parliamentary seats allocated under the proportional system which he sought
to abolish after losing his first-past-the-post seat.
However, the defeat of the left was not a rout. The Progressive Alliance may
be able to make life difficult for the government in the Senate, where Forza
Italia, the National Alliance and the League fell short of achieving an
absolute majority.
As the postmortem began among the Progressives, it was clear that the left
would not simply allow itself to be pushed around in either house of
parliament.
Mr Chiarante admitted that, particularly in the north, the left had suffered
a heavy defeat. But he added: 'It's now essential to transform this
electoral pact (between the parties of the left) into a firm democratic
unity, using this grouping as the basis and the point of departure for a
more markedly dynamic and innovative political strategy, which will prevent
the right from presenting itself as the newest and most modern force.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The electoral impact of Forza Italia has tended to overshadow the dramatic
gains made by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini,
writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The MSI/National Alliance is the third largest party in the new parliament
and now accounts for almost 14 per cent of the vote. Linked in with Forza
Italia, it has become the biggest political grouping from Rome south.
For the previous two decades, the MSI had never risen above 6 per cent of
the vote. In less than 12 months Mr Fini has transformed the party from a
marginal political role to become a key player. The general election result
in good measure reflects Mr Fini's popularity as a vigorous young leader,
untainted by corruption scandals.
The MSI has traditionally done well at a local level in isolated areas of
the south, thanks to monarchist traditions, a strong connection with the
masonic movement and a visceral identification with the achievements of
Mussolini. But the party has become a big beneficiary of the collapse of the
two main governing parties, Christian Democrats and Socialists, which
dispensed patronage in the south.
By changing the party's name from the National Social Movement - modelled on
Mussolini's political movement - to the National Alliance, Mr Fini has
managed to modernise its image and confer a new respectability. The party
also managed to retain its own identity separate from that of Forza Italia,
standing separately in Trieste and parts of the Marche. In the south, MSI
was Mr Berlusconi's equal partner and sometimes the dominant one.
Mr Fini is an enthusiastic proponent of Mr Berlusconi as prime minister. To
enter government, he will also need to remove some of the more overtly
fascist elements that hover in the party wings.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Markets get heartburn after poll party: The Italian election
 -Berlusconi alliance succeeds in the campaign but must now find a way to
govern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Italian election appears to have delivered most of what a nervous
financial and business community had hoped for: a clear victory in the lower
chamber of parliament by a single alliance of the right. Some horse-trading
will be necessary for control of the upper house, but the fear of a
parliament in which no single grouping has a majority has gone.
However, investors are notoriously fickle when it comes to politics. On
Monday, the markets were inspired by secret and illegal exit polls showing
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, as a clear winner at the head of
his Forza Italia party and its allies, the populist Northern League and the
far-right National Alliance. Milan's main stock market index rose by 3.76
per cent; the lira strengthened.
Yesterday, although those predictions were broadly confirmed, the hangover
from Monday's election night party took its toll. The Milan index began to
lose ground as the markets digested the fact that the Berlusconi alliance,
so adept at campaigning, would now have to turn its hand to the trickier
task of governing.
'International investors will focus on what any government has to do, and
they will judge a government by how quickly it acts,' said Mr Vittorio
Pignatti-Morano, general manager of Lehman Brothers in Italy.
Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, yesterday echoed these
sentiments, urging a new government to act quickly and clearly to pursue the
process of economic improvement begun by the technocratic government of the
past two years. 'The vote has given a clear indication of a choice which
supports market forces and gives the state a fundamental role in direction
and control (of the economy) rather than management, freeing the economy
from the bonds which restrain it.'
The main reason for market concern is the potential for a row between Mr
Berlusconi and his partners. Even as results came in on Monday night, Mr
Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, made a point of knocking the
media magnate's aspirations to be prime minister and repeating reservations
about governing with the National Alliance.
In its first phase, the new government will have to act quickly to reshape
the public sector, implement fiscal reform and plug the gaps in the pensions
budget. Only then is the new coalition likely to pursue its promises of
stimulating economic recovery, including Forza Italia's ambitious promise to
create 1m jobs.
In the meantime, many entrepreneurs will be looking to the government to
break the old incestuous links between business and politics. Critics doubt
Mr Berlusconi is the man to champion a new relationship. Coincidentally, the
trial began yesterday of Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist party chief, and
12 others accused of corruption over alleged bribes by an insurance company
for a contract with state energy group Eni.
On privatisation, which the victorious parties want to speed up, the
government will have to take a final decision on how to sell 52 per cent of
Stet, the national telecoms utility, and who should advise on the sale, but
the timetable for this and other outstanding privatisations is already
pencilled into investors' diaries.
In any case, entrepreneurs who stood successfully for Forza Italia, the
Northern League and the National Alliance across the country should try to
hold the new government to its promises to favour small and medium-sized
enterprises as well as the industrial conglomerates traditionally close to
the government.
The new administration will not want to alienate this support. As Mr Alberto
Rolla of securities house Milla put it yesterday: 'The political struggle
was very dirty, especially in the last days (of the campaign), and his (Mr
Berlusconi's) problem now is presenting himself as someone who can make
peace with everyone.'

FT  30 MAR 94 / Deutsche Bahn fined Ecu11m: Brussels accuses German rail
monopoly of abusing its position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German state rail company, Deutsche Bahn, is to be fined Ecu11m (Pounds
8.3m) by the European Commission for using cut-price rail tariffs to
encourage freight traffic to use the German port of Hamburg.
The Commission said the fines, the largest levied on a rail group to date,
had been imposed because Deutsche Bahn had abused its monopoly position,
distorting the market by discouraging traffic away from Belgian and Dutch
ports.
Deutsche Bahn yesterday refused to indicate whether it would accept the
ruling, insisting that it had not yet received the details of the decision.
However, company officials indicated that the decision, taken at a meeting
of the Commission yesterday, had come as a suprise, and suggested that the
company might appeal against it.
'We were not expecting a fine this large. We were not expecting a fine at
all,' said Mr Ulrich Kurth, Deutsche Bahn's representative in Brussels.
Commission officials said the size of the fine reflected the fact that the
infringement had occurred over a 'considerable period', with the full
knowledge of the management.
The decision follows an 18-month investigation into the rail route, which
concluded that the price charged by Deutsche Bahn for container freight from
Rotterdam to Germany was often 44 per per cent higher than the price charged
on trains from Hamburg to Germany.
In some cases, the Commission added, the price differential was as much as
77 per cent, even though the fiercer competition on these western routes
should have made these prices lower.
As a result, it concluded, ports like Rotterdam and Antwerp had been
significantly disadvantaged compared to Hamburg, and freight had been
encouraged to travel by road rather than rail.
'These practices have appreciably restricted competition, firstly between
the railway companies and the combined-transport operators serving the
various routes, and, secondly, between the German ports and other ports in
the Community,' the Commission said.
According to officials the large fine reflects the increasingly tough line
the Commission is seeking to take against transport monopolies in the
European Union, particularly in the area of combined-transport operators.
The last fine in the rail sector occurred 18 months ago, when the
International Union of Railways, a worldwide association of railway
companies, was fined Ecu1m for restricting the sale of tickets.
But in the past two years the Commission has stepped up its warnings to
other operators, including British Rail and other potential cross-Channel
operators, against adopting any practices which could be construed as
anti-competitive.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Major faces fresh leadership crisis: Tory call in House for
PM to quit - EU voting deal angers government backbenchers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major faced a fresh crisis of confidence in his leadership last
night after a compromise deal with Britain's European Union partners over
voting rights came under fierce attack on the Conservative back benches.
The bitter end to the row which had threatened to hold up the entry of four
new countries to the Union raised further doubts over whether the prime
minister can survive expected heavy Tory defeats in this summer's mid-term
elections.
Mr Major strongly defended the new EU voting arrangements, which combine an
increase in the number of votes required to block legislation with provision
for delaying contentious directives. He insisted also that Britain had won
assurances that the European Commission would not seek to use health and
safety legislation to bypass the government's opt-out from the social
chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
That claim was disputed by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who
said he had 'simply clarified the programme of the Commission for the
present year.'
Amid deep gloom among government supporters, one maverick Tory MP, Mr Tony
Marlow, stunned the House of Commons by charging that the deal had stripped
Mr Major of his authority and demanding he resign.
Despite Mr Marlow's long-standing reputation as a rebel and an eccentric, it
was the first time in more than 50 years that a fellow Tory had called in
the Commons in such blunt terms for the prime minister of the day to stand
down.
As Mr Major set out the terms of the deal, hostile Eurosceptics were joined
by usually loyal centrist MPs in attacking them as a retreat from the
position staked out only last week.
With pro-Europeans also condemning Mr Major's handling of the row,
Westminster was swept with a new wave of speculation about a challenge to
his leadership later in the year.
The compromise, which provides Britain with limited voting safeguards when
Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway join the Union next year, won
overwhelming endorsement in the cabinet. If it had been rejected, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, would have considered resigning from the
cabinet.
But four rightwing cabinet ministers - Mr Michael Howard, Mr Michael
Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood - privately backed the
widespread view among Tory MPs that Mr Major should have held out for a
better deal.
The cabinet 'bastards' as they were once referred to by Mr Major after the
Tory civil war over the Maastricht treaty did not force a formal vote on the
issue. But with Mr Portillo particularly forceful in pressing the case for
rejection, they argued that the agreement did not give Britain adequate
legal protection. One suggested that Mr Major call a heads of government
meeting to press for a better deal.
Mr Hurd countered by telling his colleagues that Britain's EU partners would
not give further ground. Ministers said that in those circumstances the
cabinet split 18-4 in favour of the deal.
Facing derision from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown,
the Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Major gave an uncertain Commons performance
in defence of the deal.
Amid silence on the Tory back benches he stressed that Britain now had a
firm commitment from the rest of the Union for a 'root-and-branch' reform of
the voting system in the planned 1996 intergovernmental conference.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said later the assurances from Brussels
on social policy meant the UK would be excluded from the provisions of three
new directives - on workplace discrimination, part-time working and parental
leave for employees.
But Commission officials rebuffed any suggestion that Britain had received
guarantees that the new voting arrangements would not lead to social policy
proposals unpalatable to the UK.
'We are not going to let them imply that there is a trade-off in social
policy,' one Commission official said.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Berlusconi seeks coalition deal: Divisions on right may slow
formation of Italian government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday began attempting to
pull together a coalition to govern the country after the landslide general
election victory of the rightwing Freedom Alliance.
The formation of Italy's 53rd postwar government will be slowed by the
differences among the three partners in the alliance and by the complex
procedures for the new parliament.
A senior member of the outgoing government of prime minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi last night said a 'clear majority has emerged from the polls', and
'it is now up to that majority to form a new government'. But observers said
a new government was unlikely to be installed before the end of April.
The Freedom Alliance - composed of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement,
the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini - won 366 of the 630 seats in
the chamber of deputies.
The victory, conceded early yesterday by all Mr Berlusconi's rivals, marked
a clear break with Italy's postwar political system and offered the prospect
of a rightwing government pledged to radical free-market policies.
Last night, Mr Berlusconi, who entered politics less than four months ago,
said he was ready to sell his business empire to avoid any conflict of
interest if he became Italy's next prime minister.
'If someone wants to buy them (the businesses) I've got nothing against it,'
he said in a television interview after his sweeping victory over the
leftwing Progressive Alliance.
Newspapers headlined the sheer scale of his victory but also highlighted
divisions within the three parties and the veto announced by Mr Bossi on Mr
Berlusconi becoming the next premier because of his business empire.
The difficulty of finding common ground between the three parties which had
formed the Alliance for mutual convenience and without an agreed government
programme knocked the euphoria from Monday's financial markets. Shares on
the Milan bourse fell almost 2 per cent, wiping away half of Monday's gains.
Mr Berlusconi had a three-hour meeting yesterday with Mr Fini to establish
the broad lines of parliamentary alliances. He appeared keen to sound out
first the MSI/National Alliance. Mr Fini's position is reportedly easier to
square with Forza Italia even though the MSI does not endorse the
free-market economic policies of Mr Berlusconi.
Mr Berlusconi let it be known through his aides that he hoped the League
might soften its aggressive opposition to forming a government with the MSI.
The failure of the left to attract a bigger vote raises doubts about the
future of Mr Achille Occhetto, of the former communist party of the
Democratic Left (PDS). Although the PDS vote held up well at 21 per cent,
the Progressive electoral strategy was said to be too defensive.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Tension rises as US rebuffs Japan trade package offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trade tension between the US and Japan worsened last night as Washington
rebuffed a Japanese market-opening package, dismissing it as 'of little
substance'.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said that the package
unveiled earlier in the day by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime
minister, was a 'half-finished work' that did not meet US concerns.
Mr Hosokawa had hoped the package would go a long way to meeting US pressure
for steps to stimulate Japan's economy and open its markets wider to foreign
goods, reducing its trade surplus. Mr Kantor's rejection, backed by the
White House, will be a severe blow to Mr Hosokawa.
The package was carefully put together after the US laid the groundwork for
possible trade sanctions in the wake of Japan's refusal last month to
provide numerical targets for imports.
Japanese officials claimed yesterday that except for setting numerical
targets, their package conceded most demands made in previous negotiations
with the US. The package aims to boost the economy and open markets to
foreign goods through deregulation and enhanced competition, laying
particular stress on four sectors - telecommunications, medical equipment,
insurance and motor vehicle parts.
But Mr Kantor still insisted on 'qualitative and quantitative indicators' to
measure the progress of export penetration of Japan's markets. He indicated
he wanted specific agreements on key sectors, more movement in regulatory
reform and 'a significant new commitment toward macroeconomic stimulus'.
Mr Kantor said the package was not enough to lead to a resumption of the
US-Japanese trade talks that broke up without agreement during a summit in
Washington last month.
But he sought to soften the US rejection by referring to the measures as 'a
work in progress'. The US was not discouraged, he said, adding: 'Our door
remains open.'
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate international trade subcommittee,
could summon no more enthusiasm than Mr Kantor. 'This very modest package of
reforms that Japan unveiled yesterday only provides further evidence that
Japan only makes real concessions under concrete pressure,' he said.
Mr Kantor said the package showed progress in the area of government
procurement, but there was 'no movement' in the motor vehicle and insurance
sectors. 'We don't want cosmetic agreements,' he added.
Yesterday the dollar dropped sharply in New York to Y103.6 against Y104.62
previously on speculation that the US would push for a higher yen. In Tokyo
this morning it opened at Y103.2.

FT  30 MAR 94 / Norwich Union suspends pensions direct sales force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union, one of the UK's leading insurers, yesterday suspended 800
agents - including its entire life and pensions direct sales force - for a
month after the industry's regulator identified breakdowns in management
control.
The move means that from midnight last night no one in the company's direct
sales force will be able to give financial advice to a customer until he or
she has successfully completed a re-training programme.
Lautro, the life industry's self-regulatory organisation, prompted the
suspensions after it uncovered shortcomings in the way Norwich Union was
implementing higher training and competency standards which took effect in
April 1993. This is the first time a financial regulator has taken such a
drastic step against a large company.
Possible disciplinary action, including fines, against the company is a
separate matter for consideration by Lautro.
Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general manager, said he
did not believe any customers had been placed at a disadvantage, since the
company operated a quality control programme separate from the process of
selling, to ensure that appropriate products were sold. Some 600 of the
agents suspended are in Norwich Union's direct sales force, and the
remaining 200 work for companies which are the life insurer's appointed
representatives.
Norwich Union's sales force is paid entirely on commission but Mr Scott
insisted that the system of payment was 'largely irrelevant' to selling
practices.
The direct sales force accounts for about 10 per cent of Norwich Union's new
life and pensions business. Mr Scott said that the company's loss from the
month when they would not be selling would be 'relatively small'.
Mr Allan Bridgewater, group chief executive, emphasised that the suspension
did not affect Norwich Union's business through independent financial
advisers and Leeds Permanent Building Society.
Lautro's action comes after it warned it would take a tough line with
companies which failed to meet its standards.
Mr Scott said the weaknesses found by Lautro in October had already been
picked up in an internal review. Some 320 sales agents had already left
since the review began last summer, he said. Seventeen managers, including
the national sales manager for direct business, have also left.

FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Firm government bonds and hopes of a pre-summer fall in interest rates sent
regional electricity (rec) and water utilities bounding forward.
The recs were particularly strong, although analysts denied this had much to
do with prepayment of bills by consumers attempting to beat the VAT
deadline. 'They are looking cheap on a yield basis and doing some catching
up,' was the view from one market salesman.
Among the best performers, London forged ahead 29 to 600p, Norweb 30 to
661p, South West 28 to 651p and Yorkshire 27 to 624p.
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, was the top performer in the
Footsie as the shares bounced back from recent underperformance on a strong
set of figures, ending the session 31 stronger at 666p.
The group, increasingly perceived as a media conglomerate, produced a higher
than expected dividend and profits up 38 per cent to Pounds 208.6m. Adjusted
for exceptionals the headline figure was some Pounds 20m higher. Although
one analyst was encouraged to bring his estimate for 1994 profits down from
Pounds 270m, most edged upward. SG Warburg increased its full-year estimate
by Pounds 23m to Pounds 255m and Goldman Sachs by Pounds 7m to Pounds 247m.
Royal Doulton, which was demerged from Pearson last year, gained 19 at 253p
on well-received figures.
Reed International moved forward 4 to 835p as it was announced that Reed
Elsevier had bought OIP Group, a French exhibitions organiser.
Insurers, many of which went ex-dividend yesterday, were restrained by a
Sunday newspaper article claiming that they were resisting payment of valid
claims. Legal &amp; General lost 1 1/2 at 483p and Prudential 5 1/4 at 312p.
Continued speculation that Great Universal Stores is building up a war chest
was enlivened by rumours that the secretive stores group had sold its entire
gilts portfolio for Pounds 350m. If true, it would take the company's cash
pile to some Pounds 1.7bn - with the market split over whether it will be
used to buy back shares or for an acquisition. Strong suggestions of a
buy-back were heard last week. Another avenue could be for the company to
bolster its significant property arm prior to a flotation.
Next, which reports results today, was one name touted as a potential
target. The shares advanced 3 to 225p. GUS, which rose smartly last week,
slipped back 5 to 579p.
Further bad news over Zantac, Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug, saw the
company's shares decline 4 to 621p. A newspaper report said Astra, of
Sweden, would get approval in the UK today for a new product involving
Losec, Zantac's competitor.
Holliday Chemical slipped 9 to 201p after announcing a one-for-four rights
issue at 180p to raise Pounds 35.8m. The company is buying the European
industrial pigments business of Reckitt &amp; Colman for Pounds 52m. Reckitt
shares, which went ex-dividend, added 17 at 608p.
Speculative buying helped Merrydown, the cider company which recently issued
a profits warning and lost its finance director last week, recover some
ground. Rumours persist of interest from a large brewing group. The shares
moved up 6 to 139p.
Dairy group Robert Wiseman rallied from a 7p discount on its market debut to
close 3 ahead of its offer price at 103p.
A 15 per cent profits forecast formed the cornerstone of Westland's defence
document against the GKN bid and the shares responded favourably, closing 7
1/2 up at 325p. GKN eased 3 to 551p. Analysts said the Westland document
bolstered the belief in the market that GKN will have to increase its
290p-a-share offer.
Smith New Court was said to have been active in placing a large line of
shares in Trafalgar House. The stock was steady at 100p.
Conglomerate Hanson retreated 5 1/2 to 269 1/2 p, with dealers citing
Kleinwort Benson as a big seller.
British Aerospace softened a penny to 506p. After the market closed, the
company warned that its foreign ownership had risen to 29 per cent, just a
half-point below its allowable level.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: US carriers line up European
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers, are
poised to form partnerships with European airlines.
American is expected to announce next month a marketing and ticket
code-sharing deal with Lot Polish Airlines, while Delta is to announce a
similar deal with Austrian Airlines today.
Lot has been seeking a strategic partnership as part of its efforts to
modernise and expand its international services. Lot operates a modern fleet
of Boeing airliners.
The deal with American is not expected to involve an equity investment by
the US carrier, but would lift Lot's transatlantic services to Chicago and
New York by enabling the Polish carrier to tap into American's large
domestic network.
It is expected to help Lot compete against British Airways on transatlantic
routes.
The UK and Poland recently settled a four-month dispute over air services.
The row, which led to the interruption of direct services between London and
Warsaw, followed BA's decision to increase its flight frequencies to Warsaw.
Lot argued that BA was seeking to syphon transatlantic traffic from Lot
through BA connecting services from London Heathrow to the US.
For American, the Lot deal would give it a partner in the growing east
European market and strengthen its marketing clout when both two big US
rivals, United and Delta, are establishing partnerships with European
carriers.
United is forming a code-sharing partnership with Lufthansa of Germany,
which regards eastern Europe as an extension of its domestic market
following reunification. Delta has a cross-equity link with Swissair and is
about to form a marketing alliance with Austrian.
Delta's deal with Austrian is not expected to involve an equity investment
by the US carrier.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels challenges Bonn over telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has increased pressure on Bonn to stop dealing
bilaterally with the US on the opening of the German telecommunications
market, by formally challenging Germany's legal compliance with the EU's
directive on public procurement.
The challenge is spelled out in a letter sent last week to Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, the German economics minister, by Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Raniero
Vanni d'Archirafi, the trade and internal market commissioners.
The letter questions whether the four-year-old directive has been fully
enacted in German law and asks Mr Rexrodt for swift clarification. Brussels
officials said that if they received no satisfactory reply by early next
month, they would consider starting legal action against Germany for failure
to meet EU obligations.
Economics ministry officials in Bonn said they hoped to settle amicably
their differences with the commission. These were sparked when the US
dropped trade sanctions against Germany last month, after Bonn indicated it
would not apply Article 29 of the EU public procurement directive.
This gives European bidders for public contracts a 3 per cent price
preference and allows tenders with less than 50 per cent local content to be
ignored. The US and Germany say the directive is overridden by a 1954
'friendship agreement' between them. but Brussels suspects Washington of
using the issue to undermine EU cohesion.
The Commission's tougher stance coincides with growing signs that the fate
of separate US and EU negotiations on liberalising public procurement may
hinge on talks at next month's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh.
Though talks in Washington last week achieved some progress, stalemate
persists over EU demands that the US repeal Buy American laws in exchange
for opening European telecommunications and power equipment markets fully to
US bidders.
Nonetheless, there appears to be growing optimism in Brussels that the EU
has wrested the initiative in the negotiations - and some useful concessions
 -from the US, where trade officials sound increasingly defensive.
Among the concessions is an offer by Washington to raise from 24 to 36 the
number of states ready to open public procurement to international
competition.
'The EU has been waging this continued attack on the whole range of US
preference programmes,' a US trade negotiator said yesterday.
EU confidence has also been buoyed by US acceptance of a recent
jointly-commissioned study by consultants Touche Ross. It found, contrary to
earlier US claims, that the dollar value of the two sides' offers to
liberalise procurement markets is broadly in balance.
The bilateral talks are due to resume in Brussels next week.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Row over worker rights feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and developing countries were yesterday on a collision course over
Washington's demand for worker rights to go on the agenda for world trade
talks.
After again failing to win support for their cause at a meeting of top trade
negotiators in Geneva, US officials said they would continue to press the
issue when ministers from more than 120 nations meet next month in Marrakesh
to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. This, many countries fear, could
lead to a full-scale row at a meeting intended to underscore harmony and set
the tone for increased global economic co-operation.
The US wants wording in the draft ministerial declaration urging the new
World Trade Organisation, which will succeed Gatt next year, to give 'early
consideration' to the relationship between 'internationally recognised
labour standards' and the world trading system.
Barring a sudden change of heart before tomorrow, when negotiators meet
formally to approve the Marrakesh documents, there will be no agreed
declaration for endorsement by ministers. Washington is also blocking
approval of a draft decision setting up a WTO preparatory committee unless
the committee is empowered to discuss worker rights and other new issues.
Speaking yesterday on behalf of the informal group of developing countries,
Mr Luiz Felipe Lampreia, Brazil's Gatt ambassador, rejected the US move as
'not acceptable'. Labour standards were a matter for individual governments;
attempts to link them to trade could result in protectionist measures which
would jeopardise rather than enhance efforts to raise wages and social
conditions.
Even those sympathetic to the US cause have refused to back it over the
ministerial declaration, preferring a less confrontational approach.

India has allowed the US-based Sprint International and SPSS to set up local
ventures, a government statement said, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
It said Sprint would form a joint venture with the local RPG Group to
develop software and provide electronic mail services in India.
The RPG group, among the largest Indian industrial conglomerates, has its
main interests in tyres and power.
SPSS has been allowed to set up a 100 per cent subsidiary to manufacture and
market its entire range of software presentation and data analysis products.
The US company plans to make India an export base for supplies to all south
Asian countries. It will set up 10 regional support centres to provide
technical support.
The two projects were among the 27 cleared by India's empowered committee on
foreign investment.
The 27 projects, with investments of Rs1bn (Dollars 32m), have projected
export earnings of Rs8bn over the next five years.
Britain's Stena Offshore, a global sub-sea contractor and unit of Sweden's
privately-owned Stena AB, also won approval to set up a 100 per cent
subsidiary.

FT  29 MAR 94 / US heaps praise on Russian premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin deserved 'much praise', Mr Ron
Brown, the US commerce secretary, said yesterday in Moscow. His remarks
underlined the strong support now being shown by the west to a government
accepted as reformist, even after losing its best known reformers.
Mr Brown is in the Russian capital with a team of US chief executives for
talks with senior ministers, including Mr Chernomyrdin, on investment and
trade. Their aim is to maintain the momentum of support for Russia, which
was greatly accelerated last week with the conditional offer of a Dollars
1.5bn loan from the International Monetary Fund.
The commerce secretary said yesterday 'the steps he (Mr Chernomyrdin) has
taken have given us great confidence on the future - steps to hold down
inflation, steps that represent fiscal prudence'.
On the IMF loan deal - reached last week in talks in Moscow between Mr
Chernomyrdin and Mr Michel Camdessus, the Fund's managing director - he said
it was 'terribly important, not only in practical terms. It also sends an
important signal, it creates momentum'.
Mr Brown's remarks came after a strong attack on the extension of the loan
by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier for finance, who said at the
weekend that the government's policies would change 'in the wrong direction'
once the loan was advanced.
While Mr Brown was complimentary about Russia's macroeconomic stance, he was
critical of the barriers met by foreign businessmen working in and with
Russia.
He said that rapidly varying taxes, recently imposed high tariff barriers
and delays in the Russian parliament approving legislation were all 'major
disincentives' to investment in the country.
'There must be some consistency (in taxation) - it's unrealistic to expect
that companies will come if tax changes constantly,' he said.
He stressed, however, that the message he wished to send was one of support.
The US government and private sector were anxious to be supportive during
Russia's transition to a market-driven economy.
'This is an economy which is moving in dramatic ways and we want to be as
helpful as we can. There will be fits and starts, there will be bumps along
the way. We want to be sure that these bumps do not cause disincentives that
will make American businessmen want to pull away.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Intel in Chinese partnership
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the world's leading producer of computer chips, plans to form a
technology partnership with China's largest electronics company. The aim is
to establish Intel's microprocessor technology as the standard for personal
computers in China.
In an agreement to be signed today, China Electronics Corporation (CEC) will
promote Intel microprocessors in China. In return, Intel will contract with
Huajing Electronics, a CEC subsidiary, to test and assemble Intel 386SX
microprocessors and microcontroller chips at its plant in China.
The US company will deliver the devices to China in the form of
pre-processed silicon wafers. Huajing Electronics will dice the wafers,
package and test them, and the microprocessor chips will be used in personal
computers and point-of-sale equipment.
The joint venture is a pre-emptive move to take advantage of the emerging
personal computer market in China, Intel said. The US chip maker regards
China as a market with huge potential. Currently, the majority of computers
used in China are based on Intel microprocessors: most, however, are
imported.
Last year China produced only about 450,000 personal computers, but Intel
expects production will grow at a rate of 60 to 80 per cent per year.
'The agreement demonstrates Intel's commitment to being a technology partner
in China's modernisation drive,' said Mr Craig Barrett, Intel chief
operating officer.
'Through this agreement we will transfer the training and technology needed
to enable Huajing to produce world class microelectronic products.'
'Co-operation with Intel will be beneficial to the development of China's
microelectronics industry and also to the development of China's computer
industry,' said Mr Yu Zhongyu, CEC president.
China Electronics is that country's largest electronics enterprise group,
with assets of Yn7.8bn (Dollars 896.6m). The group is composed of 28
domestic companies, eight foreign companies and 23 joint ventures.
In another move to promote its technology, Intel has donated 40 computers
based on its latest high-powered Pentium chips to the Qinghua and Beijing
universities.

<TEXT>
International trading group Inchcape, which has already had a rough ride on
the stock market this year, was the principal casualty in the Footsie,
retreating 37 to 515p as it announced disappointing figures.
Profits of Pounds 271.4m were up from the previous year's level, but at the
lower end of expectations after analysts removed one-off gains from property
and stripped out the Toyota franchise which the company lost last year.
Inchcape said it was also likely to come under continued pressure from a
strong Japanese yen and tough conditions across many of its global markets.
As they returned from the meeting with the company, analysts reduced
forecasts by as much as 20 per cent in some cases. The previous range of
Pounds 280m to Pounds 290m moved back to a floor of Pounds 250m and a
consensus of Pounds 260m to Pounds 270m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Opec decision hits oils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Opec to maintain its output quota until the end of the year
saw analysts furiously reworking earnings estimates and leading oil stocks
responding accordingly.
Mr Keith Morris, oil analyst with Schroder Securities, said there would be
short term weakness in the oil price but added: 'By the time we get to the
third quarter, demand will rise as buyers start to stock up for the winter.'
Pure exploration and production stocks, such as Enterprise Oil, which are
most heavily exposed to a weak oil price, were seen as most at hazard. Hoare
Govett has now factored in a Dollars 15 a barrel oil price, down from
Dollars 17 before the Opec decision, and argues that Enterprise is on a net
asset value of 250p a share. Enterprise shed 5 1/2 to 407p ex-dividend.
Among the oil majors, BP is considered the most overvalued. Nomura, which
has reduced its 1994 oil forecast by Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 14.50 a barrel,
points out the recent strong outperformance in the stock and advises clients
to sell. Hoare has cut its 1994 forecast of BP's profits by Pounds 200m to
Pounds 1bn and said earnings recovery will be set back by two years.
However, NatWest Securities still likes the stock. BP ticked back 7 to 366p.
Shell Transport, down 13 per cent since November, firmed a penny to 657p.
NatWest said Shell is starting to see the bottom of the cycle and
'moderated' its bearish stance on the stock.

FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading volume was no more than moderate in derivatives markets yesterday
but activity in stock index futures offered opportunities for arbitrage
activity, writes Terry Byland.
Traders identified two of the big US investment banks as present in London's
stock index futures trades yesterday, Salomon said to have been a seller and
Goldman Sachs a buyer.
US selling hit the June future on the Footsie as soon as trading started,
and a healthy premiumm of some 12 points to the cash market was quickly
trimmed to around 8 points; fair value, the premium allowing for financing
and dividends, stands at 3 points.
A premium of around 15 points was reopened later. Locals, or independent
traders, seized the chance to arbitrage between futures and cash. However,
the futures premium quickly shrank and the final reading of 3,132 on the
June contract was virtually in line with fair value. Volume, including
after-hours' business, totalled 12,434 lots.
Traded option activity was headed by British Steel, with 6,005 contracts
representing a call-spread in the October option; traders said it was a
neutral deal for the market. Total volume for options was 28,028 contracts,
compared with 42,093 on Friday.

FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains lost on renewed interest
rate worry - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing concern that the next turn in domestic interest rates may be upwards
undermined UK equities at the close of a highly erratic trading session
yesterday. An advance of around 21 points on the FT-SE 100 Index in early
dealing was wiped out when Wall Street opened easier and gains in British
government bonds were sharply trimmed. Worries over interest rates were
particularly acute ahead of tomorrow's routine meeting between the Governor
of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The closing reading of 3,129.5 on the FT-SE 100 showed a gain of only 0.5 on
the day. Lower oil prices, in the wake of the decision by Opec ministers to
maintain present production ceilings for the rest of the year, helped both
bonds and shares at first. 'A lower oil price is like a tax cut for
manufacturing companies, and it also encourages confidence that inflation
will stay low,' commented one strategist.
However, it was clear that investment confidence was restrained, with the
big securities houses unwilling to open up new positions in the market
during a trading week curtailed by the extended Easter weekend; important
data on US employment is due on Friday. Traders stressed that turnover had
been unimpressive, with the day's Seaq total at 516.8m shares, about 40 per
cent down from Friday's level. However, the Friday total was worth Pounds
2.2bn in retail worth, indicating one of the most active sessions of the
year.
Share prices opened lower as traders reacted to widespread comment in the
weekend press that any cut in UK base rates may now be difficult to achieve,
and that rates may soon have to rise to restrain the pressures of a
recovering economy. Tomorrow brings the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of floating
rate government securities.
But strong gains in government bonds, together with a sharp rise in the
premium on the Footsie stock index future for June, soon turned share prices
higher. Traders were not greatly impressed, and pointed out that Friday's
session had left many securities houses needing to buy stock and unwilling
to leave their trading books exposed over the Easter weekend.
The downturn, when it came, bore out suggestions that genuine underlying
demand for shares was light, and also that UK equities are still dominated
by the gilt-edged market and its continued uncertainty over the outlook for
domestic interest rates. Volume increased but selling pressure was not
heavy.
Several large US houses were clearly active in stock index futures, and
share prices were often influenced by their operations to untie positions in
underlying stocks. The final picture was fairly mixed, with company results
and special situations providing the features of what was clearly a nervous
market.
Among the blue chips, oil shares moved nervously as investors assessed the
outcome of the Opec meeting in Geneva. The new issue market looked more
healthy following news that the House of Fraser share issue, to commence
trading at the beginning of next month, had been subscribed 2.2 times.
Activity across the range of the market enabled the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to
hold on to much of an early gain, closing 10.5 higher at 3,785.7. But, with
Wall Street down 20 Dow points when London closed, traders sounded cautious
on the prospects for this morning's opening of trading in UK shares.

Wall Street
US stocks suffered their third setback in a row yesterday in spite of a
firming trend in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 12.38 lower at 3,762.35, but the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off a mere 0.58 at 460.00,
having clawed its way back from a big loss in the morning. Even so,
declining issues overwhelmed rises by 1,552 to 647 after volume of 287m
shares.
In the secondary markets the damage was more severe. The American SE
composite dropped 6.22, or 1.3 per cent, to 462.21. Profit-taking in
technology stocks, which have outperformed other sectors in recent weeks,
sent the Nasdaq composite down 10.95, or 1.4 per cent, to 772.50.
Even though Dow industrials had suffered a cumulative loss of 95 points last
Thursday and Friday, profit-takers were thin on the ground at yesterday's
opening.
Stocks showed little reaction to Opec's failure at the weekend to agree cuts
in its current production ceiling. The cartel's inaction raised the
likelihood of further declines in the price of crude oil, and a subsequent
easing of inflationary pressures in the economy.
Equity investors were also unimpressed by a modest rally in bonds, which had
pulled stocks sharply lower at the close of last week. In early trading
yesterday, the yield bid on the benchmark 30-year government issue again
slipped below 7.00 per cent, a level breached on Friday for the first time
in 10 months.
Yesterday the blue chips were stubbornly anchored in negative ground. The
Dow industrials were down as much as 35 points at one stage, but managed to
retrace some of their losses before the session's conclusion.
Cyclical issues again dragged the Dow lower. Caterpillar was off Dollars 2
3/8 at Dollars 114 and Allied Signal down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 37.
Energy stocks were generally weaker, reflecting the prospect of a further
slide in crude prices. Arco retreated Dollars 3 to Dollars 98, Mobil Dollars
1 to Dollars 77 1/2 and Texaco Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 .
Both large and small-capitalisation technology issues were hammered. On the
NYSE, Micron Technology fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 82 5/8 and Computer
Associates International Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq, America On-Line plunged Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 81 1/2 on
reports that Mr Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft who holds about 18 per
cent of AOL's stock, was considering the sale of his stake.
Canada
Toronto oils took a different line from their European counterparts on
Opec's failure to agree immediate oil production cuts, and the sector index
ended 162.79, or 3.4 per cent, down at 4,593.66 as the TSE 300 composite
lost 40.32, or 0.9 per cent, at 4,487.97.
Golds eased about 1 per cent in sympathy with oils.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo retreated from the day's highs to end only 0.7 per
cent up after market participants turned bearish on news that Brazil's
Supreme Court backed a legislative workers' motion against President Itamar
Franco's injunction blocking an 11 per cent salary increase 12 days ago.
The Bovespa index ended at 14,693, up 102 points. Turnover was Cr218.8bn
(Dollars 248.7m).

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Big swings in Mexico and New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big global bourses fell last week, with equity traders living on their
nerves, depressed by the continuing rise in US long bond rates and buffeted
by intraday volatility.
This time, Japanese equities were unable to avoid the general concern over
world events; in fact, they were depressed additionally by rising tensions
in the Korean peninsula and fell in line with the European and US blocs, as
did the FT-Actuaries World Index with a drop of 2 per cent in local currency
terms.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the week was a rise of more than 6 per cent
in Mexico, in spite of the assassination on Wednesday of the governing
party's presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio - and following
initial falls of 10 per cent last Thursday in Mexican stocks in Europe.
Mexico City, closed on Thursday as a mark of respect, fell to begin with on
Friday but recovered to end with the IPC index down only 0.9 per cent on the
day.
Ms Justine Roberts of SG Warburg Securities says that this was an
understandable response, and offers three good reasons why:
first, a number of houses advising on international asset allocation saw a
potential setback in Mexican equities as a buying opportunity;
secondly, last Thursday Mexico completed negotiations to join the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, its acceptance
having been seen as a sign of faith in Mexico;
and thirdly, the left wing opposition is unlikely to gain from the loss of
the ruling party's main candidate. 'The odds remain heavily in favour of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),' says a Warburg note, 'and the
chances of economically imprudent left wingers gaining office remain as
remote as ever.'
The biggest fall of the week came in New Zealand, down 7.3 per cent, partly
due to the weight of Telecom in the World Index component. Ms Pauline
McAtamney at Ord Minnett says Telecom, with its high payout ratio, is viewed
as a dividend stock and highly interest rate sensitive.
Generally, she adds, the drop in global bond markets has hit New Zealand
stocks since the beginning of February; and, more recently, New Zealand
forestry shares have been following the North American counterparts down.

against next month's elections, depressed both activity and share prices,
although markets ended off the day's lows. The overall index lost 139, or
2.7 per cent, at 5,031, golds 92 at 2,123 and industrials 131 at 5,737.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei resumes upward
course in technical trading
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices closed higher on technical trading but volume was thin;
investors were cautious on the first trading day for delivery in the new
business year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average gained 105.31 at 19,941.79 after a low of 19,725.55
and high of 20,062.91. Selling subsided as most companies and financial
institutions had finished their stock selling to spruce up their financial
books ahead of March 31, the fiscal year-end.
A fall in futures contracts, following the decline on the Chicago futures
market on Friday, pulled stocks down briefly during the morning. Shares rose
on investment trust fund demand, and foreign investors were also seen buying
stocks in small lots. Volume was 250m shares, against 353m.
Uncertainty over movements in overseas financial markets also kept many
investors inactive, while investor sentiment was also depressed as 1,038
shares went ex-dividend.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.49 to 1,612.84 and the
Nikkei 300 put on 0.68 at 295.86. Advances led declines by 521 to 495, with
129 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.37 firmer at
1,330.34.
Reports of increased investment in cable television boosted multimedia
linked stocks. Itochu, the trading house which, according to reports, is
investing Y40bn in its cable television business, climbed Y31 to Y673, while
Toshiba gained Y16 at Y799.
Other telecom linked shares were stronger. NEC, a leading maker of
communications equipment, was the most heavily traded issue, adding Y50 at
Y1,150, and Fujitsu rose Y30 to Y1,060.
Mining and non-ferrous metal companies were higher on a rise in commodity
prices. Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y11 to Y931 and Showa Aluminum Y40 to
Y510.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 59.27 to 22,129.51 in volume of 20.9m shares.
Roundup
The region was affected by a series of individual factors.
HONG KONG swung to modest losses at the close as sharp early gains on a
rebound in Jardine Matheson were wiped out. The Hang Seng index shed 37.18
to 9,197.03, off a day's high of 9,362.80. Turnover shrank to HKDollars
4.7bn from Friday's HKDollars 5.9bn.
Jardine Matheson rallied HKDollars 6 to HKDollars 53.50 after falling
sharply in recent days following the announcement of its plans to pull out
of the bourse. Some switching was seen into Jardine by European funds, out
of Swire Pacific, which receded HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 54.50.
SINGAPORE continued to see US selling and the Straits Times Industrial index
slipped 23.49, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,059.93. Volume amounted to 119.4m
shares.
Inchcape appreciated 31 cents to SDollars 5.15 after reporting healthy
results for 1993.
SEOUL ended higher in a technical rebound which took
the composite index up by 10.56 to 883.24.
Brokers said that institutional support of some banks boosted the sector
ahead of rights issues in the next month: the banking sub-index rose 23.86
to 619.70.
MANILA remained firm on bargain hunting. The composite index put on 54.61 at
2,685.68. Combined volume climbed to 1.8bn shares valued at 1.25bn pesos.
Top traded issues were the 'A' and 'B' shares of Manila Electric which rose
respectively by some 2 per cent and 3 per cent to 372.50 pesos and 470
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its falls on continued selling pressure, the composite
index closing 18.67, or 1.9 per cent, down at 951.43 after touching a low of
942.35 in morning trade.
Investors remained nervous ahead of the release of Bank Negara's annual
report tomorrow. Turnover shrank to 141m shares from Friday's 194m.
AUSTRALIA dropped to a new low for 1994, dragged down by weakness in the
bond market and futures exchange. The All Ordinaries index fell 42.7 to
2,108.9. Turnover came to ADollars 795.6m. Industrials were among the main
fallers, the All Industrials index weakening 68.5 to 3,192.2.
BHP tumbled 26 cents to ADollars 17.08 after Foster's Brewing sold its stake
in Beswick Pty, BHP's biggest shareholder.
NEW ZEALAND dropped to its lowest point since last December, but brokers
said that part of the fall was caused by key stocks going ex-dividend. The
NZSE-40 capital index finished 30.96, or 1.4 per cent, lower at 2,119.06.
BOMBAY ended modestly higher after a restricted 90-minute trading session.
The BSE 30-share index moved forward 17.23 to 3,695.39.
Activity was depressed by regulations specifying that margins on purchases
should be paid the same day.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India has also banned the carry forward
system.
KARACHI reflected nervousness following violence in the city on Sunday in
which three people were killed.
The KSE 100-share index dropped 61.14, or 2.3 per cent, to 2,561.43.
BANGKOK declined on worries about political uncertainty and news of an
increase in lending rates by some commercial banks. The SET index
surrendered 33.73, or 2.64 per cent, at 1,246.34 in thin turnover of
Bt4.3bn.
The construction materials, property and communications sectors were hit by
profit-taking.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rumours of right wing win lift
Milan by 3.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses rallied, but some brokers were wary about the quality of yesterday's
gains, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN, with voting continuing in the general election, was boosted by
unfounded rumours that the right-wing coalition had won sufficient votes to
form a clear majority.
Domestic buyers were extremely active, swelling turnover to near record
levels, as the BCI index settled up 23.79 or 3.5 per cent at 693.52.
Preliminary estimates suggested that screen trading reached a record, at
L1,400bn. Screen trading currently accounts for 80 per cent of business.
With exit polls not officially available until the close of voting late last
night, the market's positive mood was driven by speculation, brokers said. A
win for the right wing groupings would certainly provide a short term boost
to equities, they added, given that such a result had not generally been
forecast.
Aside from election fever the only other story of interest yesterday was
confirmation that Stet and Siemens of Germany had signed an accord to form a
telecommunications partnership. Stet closed up L333 at L5,470 and Sip L300
at L4,638.
FRANKFURT rose on domestic news, extended its gains during part of the
afternoon and subsided towards the end, in line with an early wobble on Wall
Street. The Dax index was 31.36 higher at 2,161.42 on the session, and hit
2,176.06 in the post bourse before closing the afternoon at 2,167.72.
Turnover inched up from DM7.6bn to DM7.7bn after Friday's DM3bn fall. Mr
John Blackley of James Capel said that share prices were spurred by
inflation figures, first from Bavaria and then for western Germany as a
whole.
'The bund future was trading 30 basis points lower, and very weak,' he said,
'then Bavaria came in with a 2.8 per cent year-on-year inflation rate, the
bund future moved to 10 points up, a gain of 40 points in two minutes, and
the Dax followed it higher.'
The index gains were driven by carmakers, with BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen
all up more than 2 per cent on the session. Siemens tried to keep up, rising
DM11.50 to DM708.5 on its deal with Stet but it lost ground to close at
DM706.50 in the London afternoon.
AMSTERDAM recovered all of Friday's losses and then gained more ground as a
number of companies came out with good news, and internationals performed
well.
The AEX index improved 4.10 or 1 per cent to 410.93.
The chemicals stocks did well with Akzo pulling back some of last week's
losses, the shares adding Fl 3.90 to Fl 218.50 and DSM improving a further
Fl 1.20 to Fl 130.20.
The Opec agreement gave Royal Dutch a rise of Fl 1.30 to Fl 191.80, while
Reed Elsevier advanced Fl 3.10 to Fl 169.50 on news that it had acquired a
French group specialising in exhibition organisation. KLM, up Fl 2.60 at Fl
46.70, was helped by expectations that its share issue had been heavily
subscribed.
PARIS found little to support a significant upward move and the CAC-40 index
finished 7.87 higher at 2,144.49.
LVMH put on FFr14 to FFr858. The group was recently upgraded by James Capel,
which expected earnings growth of around 25 per cent per annum in 1994 and
1995, based on higher turnover, better operating margins in the champagne
division and a drop in interest payments.
ZURICH went bargain hunting and the SMI index closed 30.6 higher at 2,862.4.
It was led higher by financials; there was hope that Swiss March inflation
data could lift the market today, and in the meantime UBS bearers topped the
active list as they rose SFr28 to SFr1,228.
Chemicals rose ahead of Ciba-Geigy's annual news conference in London today,
Ciba by SFr13 to SFr915, Sandoz by SFr40 to SFr4,050 and Roche by SFr85 to
SFr7,090.
MADRID saw some mild profit-taking by domestic funds looking for end-quarter
capital gains as the general index slipped 2.07 to 327.32 in low turnover of
Pta21.67bn. Banesto dropped Pta63, or 7.8 per cent to Pta750 after
Saturday's shareholder approval for the Bank of Spain-sponsored rescue plan
for the company.
WARSAW fell nearly 5 per cent and brokers expect the downward trend to
continue. The WIG index lost 873.4 to 17,646.3 with volume rising 18 per
cent to 1.6m shares.
ISTANBUL was encouraged by the better than expected result for the coalition
of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in local elections at the weekend. The
composite index added 5 per cent, gaining 678.07 to 14,214.19. The market is
now waiting for the government to announce details of an austerity package.
TEL AVIV's Mishtanim index rose 12.89, or 6.45 per cent to 212.68 in trading
shortened by the Passover holiday, on reports of progress in peace talks
with the PLO.
The market peaked at almost 260 early in February but it was described then
as overvalued, and subsequently upset by an investigation into alleged stock
manipulations.
ATHENS fell nearly 2 per cent as selling which began last week gathered
pace. The general index closed at 1,040.54. in turnover estimated at Dkr5bn.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark yesterday gave up some of the gains it made at the end of last
week, finishing weaker against the dollar, sterling and European currencies,
writes Philip Gawith.
Amid fairly quiet trading ahead of the Easter weekend, the D-Mark's retreat
was more a case of reversing a trend that had gone too far last week, than a
reaction to any fresh data.
The D-Mark was led lower in Europe by the resurgent Italian lira ahead of
the announcement today of the election result. Dealers said there was an
element of short-covering by some investors in anticipation of a
post-election rally.
Following last week's bout of strength, the D-Mark fell victim to
profit-taking before Easter. Volumes, however, were light with dealers
reluctant to take positions ahead of the weekend.
The German currency gained little support from comments by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, that he was still worried about the
high rate of German money supply growth. On the other hand, a small drop in
inflation encouraged those hoping for a quicker fall in interest rates.
The statistics office said West German CPI rose 0.2 per cent from February
and 3.2 per cent year-on-year, weaker than the previous month's 0.3 per cent
and 3.4 per cent.
Economists said the figures confirmed the favourable trend of German
inflation and predicted the headline number could fall below 3 per cent in
the coming months. NatWest Markets in their latest forecast put German CPI
at 3.1 per cent in the second quarter and 2.8 per cent in the third quarter.
The futures market was cheered by the inflation figures, with the June
three-month Euromark contract three basis points firmer at 94.57. The market
is thus discounting three-month money at 5.43 per cent in June, compared to
the current level of about 5.75 per cent. The December contract was four
points higher at 94.91.
The overall tone of the futures, however, remains pessimistic. The market
expects interest rates to bottom in March next year, with three-month money
at 5 per cent compared to 5.75 per cent now. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond
strategist at BZW, believes rates will be at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent by that
time.
The outlook for a further fall in the repo rate this week, from 5.80 per
cent, remains promising. Call money is currently about 5.70 per cent. Ms
Reed predicts a 5 to 7 basis-point fall in the rate.
The D-Mark finished against the dollar in London at DM1.6728, down from
DM1.668 on Friday. It was also weaker against most currencies in Europe. In
terms of the Spanish peseta, it closed at Pta82.15 from Pta82.27. In New
York the dollar ended at DM1.6721.
Elsewhere in Europe, the lira enjoyed a strong recovery to close in London
at L978.4 per D-Mark from L988.8. Analysts said this rally probably
reflected short lira positions being squeezed out of the market - that is,
people who had sold lira without owning it being forced to buy it back.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said the
market appeared to have revised its view of a desirable Italian election
result. Initially the consensus was that the market would prefer a
centre-left government, preferably with Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime
minister and former central bank governor, at the helm. Now a greater
premium is being placed on a stable government that can implement a credible
deficit reduction plan. There is, however, a view in some quarters that a
stable government of the centre-right is not possible.
The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.00 per cent at
a securities repurchase tender held to put funds into the money market. The
franc was slightly stronger at FFr3.422 from FFr3.426 against the D-Mark.
Sterling had a quiet day, ending firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.5035 from
DM2.4978. Analysts said this reflected D-Mark weakness rather than any
renewed appetite for pounds.
It was marginally lower compared with the stronger dollar, ending at Dollars
1.4966 from Dollars 1.4975. The UK currency has failed repeatedly in recent
months to break decisively above Dollars 1.50.
Apart from being held back by continuing to trade with the dollar, analysts
said the pound remained vulnerable on the political front. The government
appears in something of a lose-lose situation in the current debate over EU
voting rules: a compromise will anger Tory Euro-sceptics, while a hardline
attitude will leave Britain as the odd man out in Europe.
The message from sterling futures is that the market is increasingly
pessimistic about the outlook for lower interest rates in the UK. The June
short sterling contract fell a further 6 basis points to 94.60, while the
December future was 9 points off at 94.09.
Money market rates were broadly unchanged, with three-month money offered at
5 3/8 per cent. In the discount market, the Bank of England provided late
assistance of Pounds 265m. Earlier in the day it put Pounds 522m into the
market after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 850m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices drop after OPEC
holds output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices fell sharply yesterday as markets responded to the decision by
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut output at a
time of year when world demand is usually low.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for May delivery was Dollars 13.20 a
barrel in late London trading yesterday, 70 cents below Friday's close. It
has lost almost Dollars 5 over the past year.
Traders said there was scope for prices to test the five-year low of Dollars
12.90 reached earlier this year. 'If it holds at that level then it could
bounce back,' said Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at the London office of Lehman
Brothers, a US investment bank. 'But, if it breaks through that barrier, it
could go as low as Dollars 12.50,' he added.
Opec members, who met in Geneva at the weekend, said they expected the
markets' initial reaction to be negative. But they justified their decision
to hold the present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day until the end
of the year, citing forecasts of higher demand by then.
Iran, which had favoured a cut to boost prices, yesterday renewed its
criticism of Saudi Arabia, Opec's dominant producer, which refused to take
part in any scheme which would reduce its 8m b/d quota.
Mr Gholemreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, told a Teheran news
conference: 'Saudi Arabia's decision to oppose any decrease in Opec's
production ceiling has only served to keep down the price of oil.'
Analysts said prices were likely to be volatile next month. Mr Joseph
Stanislaw, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris,
believes prices will eventually recover if Opec states adhere to the quota.
However, he predicted that traders would continue to test Opec's nerves over
the next few weeks, and that it might take as long as three months for
'bearish market psychology' to be reversed.
The prices will also be influenced by refiners, who must decide in the next
few months whether they can put off rebuilding stocks depleted by recent
cold weather in the hope of lower prices in future.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy braced for fresh row over
its EU milk quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy was braced last night for a new row over its European Union milk
quota, which it is threatening to widen to other areas in another example of
hostage-taking in EU decision-making.
Unless it gets satisfaction, Italy says, it may hold up ratification of the
increase in the EU's revenue base agreed at the December 1992 Edinburgh
summit, necessary for increased flows of regional aid from next year.
The threat is analogous to the current row over the UK's holding up of
enlargement to include Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway as new members,
unless the rules on majority voting are changed.
Italy is upset because the European Commission feels it has not done enough
to comply with an agreement whereby it would cut its excess milk production
from 11.5m tonnes down to its permitted quota of 9m tonnes, in exchange for
which it would get an increase in quota of 0.9m tonnes.
Brussels says Italy is 350,000 tonnes short of the roughly two thirds cut it
had to make in illicit milk output.
Commission officials warn that milk producers such as the UK, Netherlands,
Germany and Denmark - unhappy at the original concession to Rome - could
block any attempt at flexibility.
Italy was expected to argue that the original 11.5m tonnes figure was an
over-estimate, and to produce some new figures.
But Italy, as well as Spain and Greece, was also expected to oppose a
Commission proposal to delay payment of olive oil subsidies until
mid-October.
The Commission fears it could get into trouble on its Ecu36bn (Pounds
28.3bn) farm budget next year because of the compensation costs in the
reform of the common agricultural policy and compensation to farmers for
currency swings during the 1992-93 monetary crises - unless the olive oil
pay
have complied with EU agreements to bring their own excess milk output into
line with their quotas, the Mediterranean trio could form a mutually
reinforcing bloc because of the olive oil proposals.
In the current dispute over voting weights after enlargement, Spain had
sided with the UK in wanting to keep the number of votes needed to block
decisions at 23 out of 76, instead of 27 out of 90 votes.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US company to develop Argentine
lithium project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FMC Corporation of the US is to proceed with the development of major
lithium deposits in north-western Argentina.
It has signed a 40-year contract with the government in 1991 to explore and
develop a lithium production facility at the Salar del Hombre Muerto dry
lake bed in the province of Catamarca, 800 miles from Buenos Aires.
FMC says production will begin in less than three years and require
investment of over Dollars 45m. It has not disclosed the deposit's reserves,
but says they are sufficient for 70 years' production.
FMC's decision follows last month's announcement by IMZ of Canada and MIM of
Australia to go ahead with a Dollars 600m gold and copper project, also in
Catamarca. More large mining projects are in the pipeline, following last
year's enactment of pro-business mining legislation.
Government officials claim that once the project is fully operational,
Argentina will rank among the world's principal producers of lithium, with
annual exports worth some Dollars 20m.
The agreement ends 30 months of wrangling over the future of the Salar del
Hombre Muerto deposit, held up by negotiations with the Catamarca provincial
government over royalties and political intrigue. By law, royalties are set
by local governments.

Market report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COCOA futures plunged at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday afternoon,
depressed by heavy liquidation in the US.
As the long-anticipated technical 'correction' in the US took its toll the
LCE May delivery price fell Pounds 29 to Pounds 904 a tonne, just Pounds 1
off the day's low.
Although dealers said there was no fresh fundamental reason behind the fall
many expected the Pounds 900 level to be broken. 'There's no support at
all,' said one. 'I don't think we'll see the industry buying until Pounds
880.'
COFFEE prices were weaker in very subdued volume.
Base metal trading was routine at the London Metal Exchange as prices
settled into narrow ranges.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commission to back Britain on
'mad cow disease'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban
on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legal
action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officials
said yesterday.
Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover for
action against the UK.
Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK
after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. The commission
has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that
there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which
Britain and the commission say are working.
In 1990, certain bovine offals, like brain and spleen, were banned for human
consumption. Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of live
cattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows.
In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming
from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
British officials say that the EU single market will be disrupted unless all
member states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat of
unilateral action risks a collapse in beef consumption similar to the fall
that followed the 1990 BSE scare.
'We feel we have a sound case and other member states and the Commission
agree with us,' a senior British agriculture official said.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Spring
takes a rain check - British Summer Time is here again, but wintery weather
is still holding back the country's crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first official day of spring was just over a week ago and British Summer
Time began with the advancing of clocks last weekend. But unfortunately no
one seems to have informed the clerk of the weather.
Both air and soil temperatures remain below normal and growth of crops sown
last autumn, together with spring work on the land, is about three weeks
late over most of the UK. Continuing unsettled weather with heavy rain
falling every few days on to soil still saturated a few inches below the
surface from one of the wettest winters on record has also delayed spring
activity on the land.
No one has yet begun to panic because early springs seldom live up to their
apparent promise in the shape of exceptional yields. There is ample time for
those crops already established as well as those yet to be planted to make
up for lost time and produce respectable tonnages assuming we get reasonable
warm weather from now on.
But there is concern over the enormous number of patches on fields. Autumn
sown cereals in particular are showing significant damage from winter
flooding, from which they will not now recover. Tens of thousands of acres
of redrilling - that is planting more seeds into those areas killed off by
excessive moisture - have already been done at considerable expense. But
although it is a good farmer's instinctive reaction to 'patch' such fields
the operation is unlikely to produce economic yields.
Added together these patches all over the country amount to a significant
area of land that will produce severely reduced or nil yields this year.
Together with 15 per cent rotational set-aside, now in its second year as a
virtually compulsory EU measure to cut production, this now means it is
improbable that the 1994 UK cereal harvest will amount to even to last
year's weather-depleted 19m tonnes. It is significant to note that in peak
harvest years during the mid 1980s the UK produced up to 25m tonnes.
Whatever the rest of the European Union is doing Britain would appear to be
doing its share to cut surpluses.
Meanwhile there are long term concerns about the damage done to soil
structure by excessive rain during the last six to eight months. In the
arable east, where I farm, for instance, rainfall during that period was up
more than 50 per cent on average and the water table is now higher than at
any time since 1953. And that only a few months after the official end to a
drought that lasted more than three years.
The effect all this recent rain has had on soils, especially those which
last winter were growing root crops like sugar beet and potatoes and on
which heavy equipment had to be used to harvest the crops, has been very
serious indeed. A foot or two under the surface of many such soils it is
possible to find 'pans' - that is layers of impervious soil caused by the
combination of wheelings and water - through which moisture will not drain,
thereby perpetuating the problem. The only remedy is to subsoil. That
involves pulling large steel tines or shares through the soil 12 inches to
20 inches deep or just below the level of the pan in order to break it up
and allow free drainage once more. It is slow, expensive work and can only
be done effectively when the soil has dried out. And even that treatment may
not be enough in worst cases.
Where the problem persists it will be necessary to lay new drains across the
land. This is an expensive operation and one that farmers can well do
without as EU guaranteed prices begin to decline. I predict we shall be
dealing with the unwelcome legacy of the 1993-94 winter for several years to
come.
Meanwhile most plantings of both potatoes and sugar-beet for harvesting this
year are being delayed by the wet weather. With sugar-beet there is, as yet,
no cause for undue concern. The crucial date by which the entire crop should
be planted is mid-April, after which potential yield can be reduced. Indeed,
I will not be at all surprised if, once again, we find ourselves planting
sugar-beet through the Easter holiday. But even that is preferable to being
stuck in a traffic jam on the way to the coast.
Time is begining to run out, however, for second early potatoes. Few have
been planted so far and the deadline for achieving optimum yields is fast
approaching. In order to create the ridges in which to plant to the seed
tubers it is necessary for the soil to be almost dry. That has occurred only
occasionally this spring and potato growers still have much of their work to
do.
There are, however, fewer of them this year than last. The still uncertain
future of the Potato Marketing Board, combined with a couple of seasons of
serious losses, has persuaded many growers to cut back or get out of
production. Taken together these factors could lead to a significant
reduction in production this year. That certainly seems to be the opinion of
Potato Futures Traders who have bid up the March 1995 price to levels not
seen for a few seasons.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact deal likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee producers and consumers are expected tomorrow to agree to set up a
new five-year international coffee pact to take over from the much-extended
existing accord on October 1.
The council of the International Coffee Organisation is due to finalise the
agreement after exporting and importing nations reached a compromise late on
Friday on the question of so-called economic measures designed to balance
supply and demand.
The consumers, who are reluctant to revive interventionist measures such as
export quotas, accepted the producers' desire to have an 'open door' to
discussion of such measures in the future. Economic measures were dropped
from the current agreement in 1989.
The terms of the new pact state that the council may consider negotiating a
completely fresh international coffee agreement that includes measures to
balance the market. This means that producing countries will be free to
raise the matter at future council meetings.
Consumers are unlikely to show interest in resurrecting controls unless
coffee prices rise substantially, said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI,
the London trade house. 'If coffee prices doubled, they might decide it's
something that would be worthwhile,' he said.
Producing countries have, however, helped boost prices since last October
through their export retention scheme.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (6): Fortunes at a watershed - Credit
Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was with some trepidation that Credit Lyonnais, the great bank of Lyon,
decided to move its headquarters to Paris in 1878. The bank's officials were
so nervous about the move that they bought a building on Boulevard des
Italiens which - if the worst came to the worst - could easily be converted
into a department store.
Credit Lyonnais is still in the same building. Despite the move to Paris, it
remains a force back in its own home town. Le Lyonnais not only dominates
banking and property in the Rhone region but is also an overweening physical
presence in Lyon itself: its tall tower looms over the city's skyline.
The great bank of Lyon has reached a watershed in its fortunes that could
prove as decisive as the move to Paris over 100 years ago. It has just
emerged from a period of frenetic expansion under Jean Yves Haberer's
chairmanship (1988 to 1993), which added to its domestic interests and
extended its retail banking network across Europe, but also burdened the
group with huge provisions on sour corporate loans and dud investments.
Credit Lyonnais fell into the red for the third time in its history in 1992,
with a net deficit of FFr1.05bn - and made an even heavier loss last year.
Its performance in 1993 was so poor that its capital ratio fell below the
minimum legal level of 8 per cent, prompting Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who
replaced Mr Haberer as chairman last autumn, to call on the French
government to rescue the bank with a recapitalisation package.
The government had no choice but to agree. After all, it could scarcely
afford to countenance a Gallic version of the Banesto collapse which is
still sending shock waves through the Spanish banking scene. Another
consideration was the knowledge that it would never be able to privatise
Credit Lyonnais if the balance sheet remained in such a fragile state.
Details of the recapitalisation package have just been released. The
government plans to give Credit Lyonnais a cash injection of FFr3.5bn;
FFr1.4bn will come from other shareholders, and there will be a float-off
transfer of FFr40bn of loans to a new company, with FFr18.4bn of the total
loans to be guaranteed by the state.
Analysts are confident that these measures should be sufficient to stabilise
Credit Lyonnais in the short term. It is now up to Mr Peyrelevade to take
further steps to secure its long term position and to prepare the bank for
its eventual privatisation.
One option is to raise capital through asset sales. Mr Peyrelevade began,
earlier this year, by selling a 30 per cent stake in the Union des Assureurs
Federales insurance group for FFr1bn. Last month he announced plans to sell
off another FFr20bn of assets over the next two years, which will involve
disposing of a large chunk of its FFr55bn investment portfolio. This
includes sizeable stakes in a number of private sector companies, such as
the Bouygues construction company and Navigation Mixte industrial group, as
well as holdings in other state-controlled concerns.
There is also significant scope for improving Credit Lyonnais's financial
performance through internal measures. Credit Lyonnais, like other French
banks, has relatively high staffing costs in comparison with its European
competitors - thanks to France's traditionally high labour costs and the
legacy of the state's influence over the banking business. Despite recent
reforms, French labour law is still too strict to permit dramatic cuts in
employment. Moreover, Credit Lyonnais's own staff have demonstrated, through
their participation in recent industry-wide strikes, that they would resist
such initiatives. Yet analysts are convinced that it should be able to
achieve some improvement.
Credit Lyonnais also seems set to benefit from an upturn in the banking
market. France's banks, like every other area of the economy, have been
badly affected by the recession. One problem has been the rise in provisions
as a result of the steep increase in business failures and sharp fall in
property values. But the banks have also been hit by weak demand for credit;
static for the past two years, for the first time since the early 1940s.
These recessionary pressures are now easing. The slow but steady reductions
in French interest rates should soon start to stimulate demand for credit
from consumers and the corporate sector. Residential property is already
showing signs of recovery and the commercial sector has stabilised, thereby
alleviating the pressure on provisioning, although the rate of business
failures is still alarmingly high.
Mr Peyrelevade's hopes for recovery should be buoyed up by the favourable
changes in the banking market, providing Credit Lyonnais can avoid a
repetition of the big corporate hits which haunted Mr Haberer's final years.
The write-offs on its loans to corporate horror stories such as the late
Robert Maxwell's media empire and Olympia &amp; York, the collapsed Canadian
property group, have cast a dark cloud over Credit Lyonnais in the early
1990s.
The big corporate hits have eased over the past year or so, although Credit
Lyonnais is exposed to EuroDisney, the troubled leisure group, and is now
engulfed in a new blaze of adverse publicity over its involvement with
Sasea, the failed Swiss holding company. Sasea went bust two years ago, but
since the start of this year Credit Lyonnais has found itself dragged into
the court case over its receivership because of the Swiss judge's attempts
to indict Mr Haberer and Mr Francois Gille, who is still an employee. Credit
Lyonnais has already written off all but FFr500m of its FFr4.7bn exposure to
Sasea. and it seems highly unlikely that Mr Haberer and Mr Gille will ever
be indicted.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (9): State of the art showcase is the
city's new landmark - Opera de Lyon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A set of billboards appeared in France's big cities last summer to trumpet
the opening of 'Un Nouvel Opera' - a new opera house, in Lyon.
The description had a double meaning. Lyon did indeed gain a brand new opera
house last May with the opening of a FFr490m theatre on place de la Comedie
opposite the Hotel de Ville. But the slogan was also a pun on the name of
Jean Nouvel, its architect.
Nouvel is one of the new breed of modernists who emerged in French
architecture during the 1980s. He made his name through a series of
ambitious projects culminating in the futuristic Arab Cultural Centre which
opened in 1989 beside the river Seine in Paris, but the Opera de Lyon is his
largest and most complex project to date.
The old Lyon opera house was built on the same site in 1831; by the
mid-1980s it had fallen into disrepair. In 1986 the city council decided to
replace the building with a state-of-the-art complex as a showpiece for the
city.
'It is absolutely essential that a city like Lyon should have a cultural
life in keeping with its economic stature,' says Jacques Moulinier, deputy
mayor. 'One of our main projects over the past decade has been to establish
Lyon on the European arts scene and to raise the standard of the
architecture in the city centre. That is why it was important to commission
a landmark building from an architect of Jean Nouvel's calibre.'
What Nouvel has done is to retain the 19th century neo-classical facade of
the old opera house and its opulent foyer but to rebuild everything else:
from the huge crystalline vault he has put on top of the old facade, to the
huge 1,280 seat Salle Italienne, to the airy dance studios tucked under the
vaulted roof.
The result is a compelling combination of the old and the new. The opera
house has always been a focal point of the city centre skyline but now has
the added attraction of being twice as high, thanks to the addition of
Nouvel's glazed top floors peeping out over the top of the old sandstone
facade. The public areas are all in black, with piercing flashlights on
gleaming granite floors. (Walking through the main entrance feels like a
sci-fi version of Jonah's journey inside the whale.)
Opera goers are whisked up to the Salle Italienne on escalators and can peep
down the 22 metre drop to the ground floor from the metal walkways that
connect to the Salle. They then pass through red satin padded ante-chambers
before entering the auditorium - all in black with a golden roof, golden
doors and tiny fibre optic lights which cast a golden glow on the face of
each spectator, so that they too form part of the spectacle.
During intervals you can pop out to the foyer, which has been lovingly
restored to its original splendour with gilded walls, splendid chandeliers,
a frescoed ceiling and a picture window looking out to the towers and
turrets of the ancient Hotel de Ville.
In its first year the Opera de Lyon has been plagued by technical hiccoughs.
But its problems have been nothing to those of the accident-prone Opera
Bastille in Paris - and so far, every performance has had a full house.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (8): Europe's answer to CNN - Euronews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lyon has long been regarded as an important media centre thanks to the
success of Le Progres, the local newspaper which is one of France's three
best-selling dailies. But the city is playing its part in the multi-media
revolution as the home of Euronews, the pan-European current affairs
channel, Europe's answer to Cable Network News (CNN, the round-the-clock US
news service).
It was conceived by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)in 1986 and came on
air on January 1 last year from headquarters in Ecully, on the outskirts of
Lyon. The concept behind Euronews is to combine the live news and archive
footage compiled by the EBU's members - which include France 2 and France 3,
Italy's RAI, RTVE of Spain and the BBC - into a current affairs channel that
covers world events with a European slant.
The channel broadcasts simultaneously in five different languages - English,
French, German, Italian and Spanish - all accompanied by the same visual
material. The programming schedule, which runs for 20 hours every day, is
dominated by regular news bulletins but includes regular magazine slots on
fashion, travel and cinema.
The footage from the EBU members is relayed to the Euronews headquarters at
Ecully where it is remixed and edited by the 120-strong staff. The final
transmissions are then sent via cable, satellite and terrestial television
services to more than 40m homes all over Europe and the Mediterranean basin.
Euronews' objective is to present events of European interest in an
objective, apolitical style. It accentuates its self-effacing approach by
using behind-the-scenes commentaries and graphics, rather than presenters,
to accompany and explain its footage.
It was set up as a joint venture owned by the EBU members supplying its
footage. The share structure has been expanded to include the North African
stations, Tunisia's ERTT and Algeria's ENTV. Earlier this month Euronews
announced another restructuring plan: France Television, the
state-controlled company which owns France 2 and France 3, will raise its
stake and nurture closer operational links with Euronews.
The station operated last year on a budget of Ecu50m. Just over half comes
from its shareholders, with 20 per cent donated by public bodies (including
the EU). The remaining 25 per cent is self-generated from the sale of
advertising airtime and sponsorship rights.
The future plan is to use the proceeds of the recent restructuring to open
new editorial offices in Europe and to increase the number of languages in
which Euronews broadcasts so that it can function more effectively as a
truly international news and current affairs service.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (7): Glittering 'grand projet' - Musee
de Grenoble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official speeches are generally greeted with polite applause, but Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, was treated to a really rousing
response to the address he delivered to mark the opening earlier this year
of the glittering new Musee de Grenoble.
As the local officials had hoped, Mr Balladur had used the occasion to
promise that the government, which had paid roughly half the FFr210m cost of
building the new museum, would make a similar contribution to Grenoble's
next artistic project, the FFr200m renovation programme for the Maison de la
Culture, the city's arts centre which was built in 1968.
There is a political logic to Mr Balladur's decision. The new Musee de
Grenoble was conceived in the early 1980s, when both the city council and
the French government were under socialist control, as part of the Grands
Projets, the modern architectural programme initiated by President Francois
Mitterrand to mark the bicentennial of the French Revolution and - or so say
his critics - his own regime.
The new museum has all the hallmarks of the Grands Projets. It is a
spectacular piece of contemporary architecture in a stunning setting beside
the River Isere. The white cubist building is uncompromisingly modern but
makes the most of its location; its white walls lead up to glazed roofs
which offer glimpses of the snow-capped mountains all around the city.
It houses one of the best art collections in France. This dates back to 1796
when the Musee de Grenoble was first created to house the paintings and
sculpture seized from local aristocrats in the 1789 French Revolution. The
city has added to the collection ever since, both by acquisition and by
donations from the state.
The new museum shows off the collection to perfection, beginning with 23
rooms devoted to pre-1900 art, from 13th century Italian Renaissance pieces
to post-Impressionist paintings by Paul Gauguin. Another 40 rooms display
one of Europe's most comprehensive collections of 20th century art.
The new building will allow Serge Lemoine, its chief curator, to stage more
temporary exhibitions - and enable the Musee de Grenoble to make the most of
proposals to distribute part of the national modern art collection, now
housed at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, to other museums. This was one
of the last Grands Projets to be built. The Mitterrand era is now nearing
its end and the centre-right Balladur government has adopted a different
approach to the arts from the socialists, with a new policy focusing on
conservation.
Jacques Toubon, the new arts minister, has launched an ambitious programme
of renovating France's old buildings - more in keeping with the conservative
rhetoric of his cabinet colleagues than the socialists' zest for innovation.
He has already announced plans to restore a number of buildings in Paris,
including the Georges Pompidou arts centre and Garnier opera house.
Renovation of the Maison de la Culture in Grenoble is an ideal addition,
particularly as it was the showpiece of the policy pursued by a past
centre-right French government: the arts centre programme initiated in the
late 1960s by Andre Malraux, the writer who became arts minister under
General de Gaulle.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (10): Demand and prices recover -
Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one in the Lyon property market would try to pretend that life has been
easy over the past two years: but they do at least have the consolation
that, having gone into recession later than their Parisian counterparts,
they are recovering slightly earlier.
Lyon property prices have suffered from the same problems that have
afflicted those in the French capital. Demand for residential property has
been depressed by the combination of high interest rates and the
psychological blow of rising unemployment. The commercial sector has been
hit even harder for the same reasons, and intense pressure on corporate
profits has prompted even the most resilient companies to think twice before
investing in new property.
These problems were aggravated by the inflated state of the market at the
start of the 1990s. The value of both commercial and residential property in
Lyon enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth in the late 1980s and early
1990s. Prices rose at an annual rate of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent
in each of the four years until 1992, even though the Paris market had
started to falter by late 1990.
But the recession struck in 1992. A recent report by Jones Lang Wootton
estimates that although office rents in the Presqu'ile area of the city
centre - around the Opera de Lyon and the hotel de ville - have remained
stable at an annual average of FFr1,200 a square metre since 1992,
comparable rentals for the newer office blocks around the Part-Dieu railway
station have fallen from FFr950 to about FFr850.
However, the market is now starting to show signs of recovery. The Lyonnais
were quicker than the Parisians to adapt to the realities of recession. New
developments ground to a halt as soon as the market contracted.
As a result the Lyon market has slowly been able to fill most of the surplus
office space in the city, thereby alleviating the pressure on prices. The
Jones Lang Wootton report noted that 'since the beginning of October demand
for office space has picked up considerably, particularly from larger
companies due to internal reorganisation.'
Local officials hope that the situation will continue its slow but steady
improvement for the rest of this year, so that the market will be in better
shape in 1995 when the first phases of the Cite Internationale commercial
complex and the Part-Dieu development scheme are scheduled to be ready
The Part-Dieu development is a series of office buildings clustered around
the railway station in central Lyon. It was conceived a few years ago when
demand for Part-Dieu property was buoyant, thanks to the impact on the
city's business scene of the introduction of the Lyon-to-Paris high speed
TGV (trains de grande vitesse) route at the new Part-Dieu station.
But the most ambitious new project for Lyon in the mid-1990s will be Cite
Internationale, which has been designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian
architect who liaised with Sir Richard Rogers on the Pompidou Centre in
Paris. Cite Internationale will occupy a waterfront site in the Parc de la
Tete d'Or. It will include a conference centre, an hotel, a contemporary art
museum - and an office complex.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (3): EU flag flies highest - Lyon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are three flags fluttering on the flagpole at the arched entrance to
the Hotel de Ville in Lyon: the tricolour is one, the city flag is another,
but the flag that flies the highest, is the blue and yellow banner of the
European Union.
The Lyonnais, predictably, are fiercely proud of Lyon's position as France's
second city after Paris. They are also acutely aware of the importance of
its location: so close to the French borders with Switzerland, Italy and,
even, Germany. The Lyonnais are now counting on the city's excellent
logistics to repair the damage of the present recession and to secure its
future.
'Historically Lyon has owed its success to its role as a crossroads not only
between Paris and Marseille, but between France and its neighbours over the
Alps,' says Jacques Moulinier, deputy mayor and head of economic
development. 'Europe now needs crossroads cities more than ever and Lyon is
perfectly placed to play that role.'
Lyon, which has sprung up around the meeting point of the Rhone and Saone
rivers, traces its trading post role back to the Bronze Age. It became the
religious capital of the Gauls before being converted to Christianity and in
the Renaissance era was, thanks to the skill of its silk weavers and
bankers, one of Europe's busiest commercial centres.
Yet Lyon has a second, rather more romantic side to its heritage: the legacy
of centuries of political and intellectual dissent. In medieval times it was
the heartland of Waldensian heresy - a renegade sect that rebelled against
the established church - and became a centre for the resistance during the
second world war.
More recently Michel Noir, its conservative mayor, has perpetuated the
dissident tradition by breaking away from the RPR, the Gaullist party led by
Jacques Chirac, the powerful mayor of Paris.
Michel Noir is still at loggerheads with the RPR and also faces the threat
of imprisonment if he is found guilty of involvement in l'affaire Botton, a
fraud case for which Pierre Botton, his son-in-law, has already been
convicted. 'If he loses the case he'll lose everything,' says one Lyon
businessman. 'But if he wins, Michel Noir will be mayor of Lyon for life.'
While the mayor fights for his political future, Lyon itself is trying to
get to grips with its economic problems. The local economy has traditionally
been more robust than that of France as a whole and, indeed, than the rest
of the Rhone-Alpes region.
The recession started later in Lyon than in other French cities, notably
Paris, Lille and Marseille, but it has since struck particularly sharply.
Until two years ago the level of unemployment in the Rhone area around Lyon
stood at 8.5 per cent, well below both the national average of 9.8 per cent
and 8.7 per cent for the rest of the Rhone-Alpes region. It now stands at
11.7 per cent, only a fraction below the national figure of 11.7 per cent
and above the Rhone-Alpes average of 11.4 per cent.
The situation is even worse in les zups, deprived suburbs on the fringes of
Lyon such as Vaulx-en-Velin and the Les Minguettes area of Velisseux. The
level of unemployment in these areas hovers at about 25 per cent and is even
higher - more than 30 per cent - among school leavers.
There are signs that the worst of the recession is over and that the
economic situation is stabilising. 'It's more a matter of sentiment than of
firm figures,' says Guy Barriolade, chief adviser to the president of
Communaute Urbaine de Lyon, the district council. 'But local companies do
seem more confident and the trading climate is more positive.'
Lyon's response to its recent economic problems has been to stick to its
long term strategy of trying to upgrade its international image so that it
can attract the large investment programmes it needs to generate new jobs
and to stabilise its economy.
The main aim of this strategy is to overcome the shortcomings of its 'second
city' status by enhancing its role as a decision-making centre.
The city has already benefited from the long term policy initiated by the
old socialist government of decentralising the French public sector by
moving a number of organisations from Paris into the provinces.
It has also succeeded in attracting a number of international institutions,
notably Interpol, the espionage network, and more recently, the Aspen
Institute, which is setting up its French headquarters in the city.
But Lyon lost an important battle last year when it was beaten by Frankfurt
in the race to house the European Monetary Institute. Some locals still
blame the French government for its defeat arguing that Edouard Balladur,
the RPR prime minister, baulked at supporting the Lyonnais bid because of
Michel Noir's break with his party.
Undeterred, Lyon is pressing ahead with its image improvement strategy.
It started in the 1980s by revitalising its university: investing in new
facilities and bringing many of the 75,000 students back from the suburbs
into the city centre. It has also embarked upon an ambitious arts programme.
Its state-of-the-art opera house, designed by Jean Nouvel, opened last
summer, and a contemporary art museum at the Cite Internationale complex
designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect, is scheduled to open next
year.
These new buildings are not only intended to enhance the city's cultural
facilities but also to focus attention on the picturesque aspects of Lyon -
the quays along its two rivers, the lovely old buildings of the old town and
its wealth of museums - rather than its commercial status.
The city is also improving its infrastructure by continuing the road
construction programme begun in the 1980s. This programme will be costly
because of the difficulty of tunnelling through the hills that loom up
behind the old town. But building work has begun on a peripherique ring road
to encircle the city centre and on a new motorway by-pass for the Paris to
Marseille route.
The biggest and most expensive project of all is the ambitious plan to
extend the TGV network across the Italian border to Turin. 'It's the
catalyst we need to really establish Lyon as an international business
centre,' says Mr Moulinier.
He adds: 'We've done all the preparatory work. Now it's up to the
politicians.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (5): Poor relation of the region -
Saint Etienne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To most French cities the economic recession that has hit France over the
past few years came as a nasty shock after years of prosperity, but for
Saint-Etienne it has simply marked yet another milestone in its long term
decline.
'Most people talk about the economic crisis as though it has only lasted for
the past year or two,' says Bruno Roux, head of economic development. 'For
us it has gone on for much longer. Saint-Etienne has gone through every
imaginable crisis over the past 30 years.'
The litany of closures and cutbacks that has hit Saint-Etienne in the
post-war period is undeniably brutal. It is a relatively young city by
French standards: tracing its roots to the 19th century when coal mines and
textile mills sprang up in the area. These mines and mills were later joined
by steel plants engineering factories and by the 1930s Saint-Etienne was a
thriving manufacturing centre.
But the city has since declined dramatically as its traditional industries
have disappeared. Saint-Etienne lost almost 30,000 jobs with the closure of
the coal mines, 10,000 with the demise of its textile mills and 25,000
through the demise of the steel plants. It has also lost a string of smaller
sectors, including its bicycle factories and gun makers.
'The only consolation is that our traditional industries died at different
times,' says Mr Roux. 'This did at least give us the chance to try to heal
the wounds left by one set of closures before the next catastrophe.'
Saint-Etienne probably reached its nadir in the early 1980s when the local
level of unemployment was roughly double the national average at 12 per
cent. The local authorities redoubled their efforts to attract new
investment to the area and to try to strengthen and restructure the
surviving companies.
This initiative was undoubtedly made more difficult by Saint-Etienne's image
problem. The city, with its nouveau riche 19th century roots and traditional
dependence on 'dirty' industries such as coal mining, had long been regarded
as a poor relation of prosperous Lyon less than 60km away, not least by the
Lyonnais themselves. Its post-war troubles undoubtedly reinforced this
problem.
'One of our main difficulties is that Saint-Etienne is seen as an old mining
town,' says Coralie Grimand, deputy director of the Loire Industrial
Development Agency. 'It isn't true. The mines closed down years ago. But
images stick and are difficult to erase.'
The Stephanois, as the citizens of Saint-Etienne are called, have attempted
to build on their traditional skills to create new industries. They have
tred to build on the links between the old textile and steel mills with the
medical products industry by targeting bio-medical companies. Similarly they
have identified meat as a local speciality in the food sector on the back of
Saint-Etienne's modern abattoir and its cattle market.
One of the city's chief tactics for attracting new investment has been to
offer incentives in the form of property. Saint-Etienne has been active in
redeveloping old properties for industrial use and selling or letting them
at low rates. It has thus had some success at attracting new investment. The
best period was between 1986 and 1987, which meant that the new arrivals and
start-ups had the benefit of the buoyant years of the late 1980s.
There has also been a concerted effort to try to strengthen the existing
industrial base. 'Saint-Etienne is dominated by small companies, many of
which are used to operating as sub-contractors,' says Ms Grimand.
Saint-Etienne has also attempted to address its image problem by raising its
profile in the arts. A Museum of Modern Art opened in 1987 with a collection
that ranges from Monet and Rodin, to contemporary figures such as the German
artists, Georg Baselitz and Gerhard Richter. Saint-Etienne has also
developed its theatrical tradition by inviting European drama groups to the
city.
The 1980s initiatives have helped to broaden the local economy. The mix of
businesses is now more varied. The biggest local employer is not a
manufacturer but Casino, the supermarket group which was founded in
Saint-Etienne and is still headquartered there employing more than 3,500
people in the area.
Coralie Grimand says there are signs of a modest pick-up in new investment.
But the toll of job losses and business failures is still continuing and,
according to Bruno Roux, there is no sign of the Stephanois sharing the
increase in business confidence that is evident elsewhere in the
Rhone-Alpes.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (4): Veritable top model - Grenoble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Whenever France's local politicians ferret around for urban development role
models the city of Grenoble is almost always at the top - at the very least,
near the top - of the list.
Grenoble is home to many of the world's largest and most dynamic high tech
companies. With its strong artistic tradition and stunning setting amid
snow-capped mountains, it had for years enjoyed a stream of inward
investment and a level of unemployment well below the national average.
But all that has changed. 'We enjoyed an artificially high rate of growth
for many years,' says Guy Morens, deputy mayor and head of Grenoble-Isere
Developpement, the local economic development agency. 'Even when our
traditional industries were affected by the economic recession, we continued
to find growth in the electronics sector. But that sector is now in crisis
and Grenoble has suffered like everywhere else.'
The cutbacks at local electronics companies - such as parts of the Thomson
group's activities and Bull, the troubled computer concern - have had an
immediate effect on the Grenoble economy. The rate of job losses in the city
rose more rapidly than for the rest of France last year and now stands at
over 11 per cent, roughly in line with the national average. Grenoble, once
the envy of every investment-hungry French town, is now desperately trying
to find ways of replacing its lost jobs.
Mr Morens and his colleagues have responded with a switch in economic
development strategy. Grenoble, the city that led the rest of Europe in its
quest for high tech investment, is now turning its attention to more
traditional areas such as old-fashioned manufacturing businesses which tend
to be more labour intensive and thus more effective at reducing
unemployment.
The catalyst for the city's growth was the work of the scientists at its
ancient university, notably that of Louis Neel, the Nobel prize winning
physicist who arrived there during the second world war. The government
decided to base the CNRS, national scientific research centre, at Grenoble
in the late 1940s. Bull, Thomson and the other famous names in French
electronics have long had operations in the region. The first significant
tranche of international investment arrived 21 years ago when Hewlett
Packard, the US company, began an investment programme that culminated three
years ago in the decision to relocate its micro-computer headquarters from
California to Grenoble.
The flood of high-tech investment into the city and the surrounding area,
dwarfed more traditional businesses such as the local foundries, paper mills
engineering factories and even chemical plants such as the huge
Rhone-Poulenc complex at nearby Le Pont-de-Claix. Alain Carignon, the mayor,
and his colleagues have for some time been concerned about the subsequent
imbalance in local employment.
'We have been very successful at creating new professional jobs in the city
and that's wonderful,' says Mr Morens. 'But we do have a problem in that
there are too few unskilled jobs.'
This problem has been aggravated by the recent contraction in the
once-thriving electronics sector. The number of people out of work in
Grenoble rose by 43 per cent from 1990 to 1993, according to Jacques Champ,
head of research at GID, far faster than the 30 per cent increase for the
whole of France over the same period.
The emphasis of investment is now on housing. There has been a similar shift
in its cultural and leisure policy. The main project of the early 1990s, the
construction of a FFr210m museum to house Grenoble's huge art collection,
was completed earlier this year. The next important scheme will be the
FFr200m renovation of the Maison de la Culture, legacy of Andre Malraux's
reign as France's culture minister, opened in 1968 and now in a sorry state
of disrepair.
'One reason why Grenoble has been so attractive to new investors is because
it's such a pleasant place to live,' says Mr Morens.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (2): The radical charm of the
bourgeoisie - Local politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance the affluent Rhone-Alpes region, with its bustling
commercial centres and its conservative-controlled hotels de ville (town
halls) looks like a bastion of right-wing traditionalism.
But beneath its bourgeois facade the Rhone-Alpes has a long history of
radicalism. The citizens of Grenoble have long boasted that the Revolution
began there in 1788, a year before the rest of France. The city of Lyon was
the heartland of social catholicism in the 19th century. More recently the
region has seen some dramatic squabbles on the French right.
By far the most controversial of the Rhone-Alpes's latter-day radicals is
Michel Noir, the 49-year-old mayor of Lyon, who has not only broken away
from the Gaullist RPR to form his own political party but is now threatened
by imprisonment over his alleged involvement in a fraud case.
Only a few years ago Mr Noir appeared to be rising effortlessly through the
RPR ranks. He served as a junior finance minister during the last
centre-right coalition government, from 1986 to 1988, and was even tipped as
a future successor to Jacques Chirac, the powerful mayor of Paris, as the
party's leader.
But Mr Noir resigned from the RPR in late 1990, in protest at the bickering
among the party leadership. He founded his own breakaway movement in the
hope that other disillusioned French conservatives would follow. (In the
event he was joined by only two colleagues and his new party has never taken
off.)
He has continued to clash with the RPR leadership - sometimes to Lyon's
detriment. Most locals, for instance, are convinced that one reason for the
city's failure to become the location for the European Monetary Institute
was the lack of support from the French government. Yet Mr Noir has held on
to the support of the Lyonnais voters.
He now faces his toughest challenge so far. Pierre Botton, his son-in-law
and former campaign manager, has already served five months in prison for
fraud. Mr Botton has accused the Lyon mayor of misappropriating public
funds. He has denied the charge but the case against him has yet to be
concluded. If Mr Noir is found guilty he will almost certainly face the same
fate as his estranged son-in-law: imprisonment. But a 'not guilty' verdict
would confirm him as the Rhone's champion against the Parisian power-mongers
 -and he could, in the words of one local politician, 'be mayor of Lyon for
life.'
His near neighbour, Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, has also clashed with
the RPR leadership, although not quite so spectacularly as Mr Noir. Mr
Carignon, 45, was suspended from the party a few years ago for urging voters
in a local by-election to support the Socialists rather than the extreme
right-wing National Front.
But Mr Carignon, unlike Mr Noir, has remained within the RPR ranks. He has
also managed to repair relations with its leadership. He failed in his bid
to become arts minister after the conservatives' success in last spring's
legislative elections but was given the communications portfolio.
Since then Mr Carignon has had to grapple with the task of pushing his
broadcasting reforms through parliament. (He has also come under fire in the
recent row over the future of Canal-Plus, the popular pay-TV channel, and
the sudden resignation of its founder, Mr Andre Rousselet, as chairman.)
His cabinet colleague, Michel Barnier, can count himself lucky to have been
able to adopt a lower profile in his potentially contentious post as
environment minister. Mr Barnier, 43, who has held the Albertville seat for
the RPR since 1978, came into the limelight two years ago when he chaired
the organising committee for the Albertville Winter Olympics.
The environment ministry is his first big role in national politics - and
might have been something of a mixed blessing, given the power of France's
green parties. But the environmentalists have seemed more interested in
squabbling among themselves rather than in attacking Mr Barnier, who has had
a relatively smooth ride in his first year as a minister.
Charles Millon, mayor of Belley and chairman of the Rhone-Alpes regional
council, chose to opt out of the cut and thrust: he has refused no fewer
than three times to accept the agriculture portfolio on the grounds that it
could conflict with his commitment to European unity. Few people would doubt
that he made the right decision after the rows over France's role in the
Gatt negotiations. But Mr Millon, 48, has found himself in the party
political firing line as the parliamentary leader of the UDF, the main
opponents of Edouard Balladur's RPR faction within the ruling centre-right
coalition.
So far Mr Millon has avoided too many public rifts with the prime minister.
But he has never been known to shrink from conflict in the past and rarely
loses an opportunity to remind Mr Balladur that he and his fellow UDF
adherents will not be content to play a passive role in the coalition.
Of all the local political heavyweights, only Raymond Barre, the former
economics professor who was prime minister of France in the late 1970s, has
managed to remain entirely aloof from the fray in local and national
politics. Now 70, Mr Barre is perfectly cast in the role of the grand old
man of Rhone-Alpes politics and is an enthusiastic advocate for the region.
He may have lost last year's battle to lure the European Monetary Institute
to Lyon, but he recently scored a more modest success by helping to persuade
the Aspen Institute to base its French headquarters in the city.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (1): Region revitalised for prosperity
 -France's largest economic region outside Paris, an historic centre of
French conservatism, is hauling itself out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When the glossy new Opera de Lyon opened its doors on the Place de la
Comedie last summer, the city gained a state-of-the-art opera house, an
architectural showpiece which has transformed its skyline.
The new Opera is an uncompromisingly contemporary building designed by Jean
Nouvel, one of France's most innovative architects. His modernist vision is
only the first of a series of ambitious architectural schemes for Lyon over
the next few years. Restoration of the Beaux Arts museum is nearly complete.
The first phase of the Cite Internationale commercial and cultural complex,
designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect, opens next spring. These
buildings are intended not only to revitalise Lyon, but to enhance its
status as the capital of the Rhone-Alpes region.
'Rhone-Alpes is already established as one of Europe's strongest economic
regions,' says Thierry Bernard, head of ERAI, the local business development
organisation. 'But if we are to prosper in the future we must improve our
resources and that includes ensuring that Lyon is recognised as a city of
international calibre.'
Rhone-Alpes today is a vast and varied region stretching from the Rhone and
Beaujolais vineyards in the north to the snow-capped Savoie mountains on the
Swiss and Italian borders in the east, to the rural beauty of the Ardeche in
the south. Physically it is the same size as the Netherlands, Belgium and
Switzerland toether. Its population of 5.2m people is roughly equivalent to
those of Denmark and Finland.
Economically Rhone-Alpes is the second largest region in France, after the
Ile-de-France area around Paris. Its gross domestic product is FFr574m. It
owes its economic strength to the long tradition of scientific innovation in
its universities and to the manufacturing prowess of its cities: Lyon with
its broad industrial base; the old mining and textile town of Saint-Etienne;
and the pioneering high-tech centres around Grenoble.
The solidity of its old industries, coupled with the dynamism of its new
high-tech enterprises, has historically sheltered Rhone-Alpes (apart from
Saint-Etienne) when the rest of France has been bruised by recession. Its
location - so close to Germany, on the border with Switzerland and Italy -
has helped local businesses to build up buoyant export trade to counter any
downturn in domestic demand.
When the present French recession began three years ago it seemed as though
the Rhone-Alpes region would again emerge unscathed. But the franc's
strength since the currency crisis of autumn 1992 has had a devastating
effect on the region's exports - particularly on sales to Italy, its main
foreign market. Since then, the region has been blighted by job losses,
business failures and plunging property prices. The recession may have been
shorter there than in other areas, but it has undoubtedly been sharper, as
illustrated by the alarmingly steep increase in unemployment.
Traditionally, the level of unemployment in Rhone-Alpes has been lower than
in the rest of France. However, the speed and scale of cutbacks over the
past two years has brought the region almost into line with the national
average. At the end of 1991 unemployment in the region stood at 8.7 per
cent, against a national average of 9.8 per cent. The unemployment figure
has since risen by 20 per cent in the whole of France - but it has increased
by 27 per cent in Rhone-Alpes. As a result, 11.4 per cent of the local
workforce is now unemployed: uncomfortably close to the national average of
11.8 per cent.
The worst affected areas have been those which were once most prosperous.
Grenoble has been badly affected by the crisis in international electronics
which has forced many local companies, notably Thomson and Bull, to
rationalise, thereby imposing intense pressure on their sub-contractors and
suppliers. Similarly, Lyon has been hit by the difficulties of its
chemicals, textile and construction companies.
By contrast, Saint-Etienne is still licking its wounds after the long term
erosion of its industrial base caused by the closure of its old coal mines
and textile mills. It has at least the consolation that unemployment has
recently risen more slowly there than in the rest of France. However, the
local unemployment level is still above the national average, at about 13
per cent.
There are now signs that the tide is turning and that Rhone-Alpes, having
gone into recession later than other regions, may be emerging earlier. 'It's
too soon to talk in terms of recovery, but the situation does seem to have
stabilised,' says Guy Morens, deputy mayor of Grenoble. Jacques Moulinier,
his opposite number at Lyon, shares his cautious confidence.
'The Rhone-Alpes economy reached its nadir last October and is now in a
stable state,' says Thierry Bernard of ERAI. 'The number of job losses is
falling and business start-ups are accelerating. Companies have managed to
reduce their stock levels and orders are starting to increase again.'
Two years of severe recession argue against a rapid recovery. The consensus
among local economists is that the situation will remain reasonably stable
through spring and summer, with an upturn forecast for early autumn.
In the meantime, local officials are sticking to their long term strategy of
trying to make the most of the region's cosmopolitan location by attracting
international investment. The rejection last year of Lyon's bid for the
European Monetary Institute (precursor of the European Central Bank) was a
serious blow. It would have been an invaluable catalyst for investment.
Yet the regional authorities and city councils are pressing ahead with plans
to improve local infrastructure. One aspect of this strategy is investment
in prestige arts projects such as the FFr490m Opera de Lyon and the
sumptuous new FFr210m Musee de Grenoble. Another is the continuing effort to
improve road and rail links. Creation of the TGV (trains a grande vitesse)
network was an important reason for the region's buoyancy in the 1980s. It
is still growing. In June, Satolas, the main Lyon airport, will become the
first French airport with a TGV link.
But the most ambitious project of all is the plan to link Lyon to Turin by
TGV. This would reduce the travelling time between the cities to just over
an hour, but the scheme - which would involve tunnelling 56km through the
Alps - would be extremely complex and expensive.
The traumas of the Channel Tunnel project have deterred prospective private
sector investors. The Lyonnais and their Italian partners will soon start
lobbying for public sector support. They are beginning to realise that
funding will be hard to find in the current economic climate.
But they are also acutely aware that a trans-Alpine high speed rail link
could enable Lyon and the rest of the Rhone-Alpes to fulfil their true
potential as one of the European commercial centres in the next century.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts rebound as crude oil
prices fall
</HEADLINE>

UK government bonds rebounded by around 1 1/2 points at the long end
yesterday morning as a fall in crude oil prices following Opec's decision
not to cut output helped to quell fears of rising inflation in the UK,
analysts said.
They added that last week's steep decline in gilt prices sparked some light
buying of cash gilts across the yield curve early in the day.
The rise in gilts helped to cut the semi-annual yield differential between
10-year gilts and 10-year German government bonds to around 143 basis points
from 153 basis points on Friday.
However, gilts had surrendered some of their gains by the afternoon as
investors who had been seeking to lighten their holdings used yesterday's
short-lived rally to do just that.
Mr Simon Briscoe, gilts analyst at S. G. Warburg, said the early rebound in
prices did not come as a surprise but that it was not enough to restore
investor confidence. 'The market remains riddled with nervousness and
uncertainty,' he said.
However, Mr Briscoe said the shortage of ultra-long dated gilts helped them
to outperform other maturities, with the yield on the 8 3/4 per cent gilt
due 2017 dropping by 15 basis points.
By contrast, yields at the short end only fell by six basis points, traders
said.
The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe touched a high of 107 1/2
in good volume before dropping back to 106 15/32 in the late afternoon, for
a gain of  3/4 points on the day.
Italian government bonds surged by nearly three points yesterday on rumours
that the right-wing alliance headed by the media magnate, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, would win enough votes in the general election to be able to
form a government. The strength of the lira helped to fuel the rally,
traders said.
They said the rumours were based on leaked private exit polls taken during
Sunday's voting. However, they added that the outcome of the election, which
was still going on yesterday, was far from certain.
One trader warned that caution could soon return to the market, especially
when investors took a closer look at the 'tax cuts for growth' policies of
the right-wing alliance.
The June contract of the 10-year Italian government bond future on Liffe
rocketed to 112.67 before trading at 111.60 in the late afternoon, up 1.71
points on the day.
German government bonds drew strength from the release of German inflation
data for the month to mid-March, which were in line with expectations, and
from market hopes that the Bundesbank would announce a further easing of
between five and eight basis points in its repo rate this week.
The June contract of the bund future on Liffe stood 0.53 points higher in
late trading at 96.32.
Denmark's decision to introduce a 30-year government bond has unsettled
Copenhagen's mortgage bond market, traders said. The 30-year government bond
will be launched on April 6 with a 6 per cent coupon and will extend the
yield curve from the current limit of 10 years.
Last year, Denmark's mortgage credit institutions introduced a 30-year
series with a 6 per cent coupon. The mortgage bonds proved attractive and
outstanding volume rose to about DKr160bn. However, traders said
non-residents appeared to have been selling the 30-year mortgage bonds with
a view to re-investing in the 30-year government bond.
In general, Danish bonds prices recovered in line with other European bond
markets, with the price of 2026 mortgage bonds moving up from Friday's 84.30
to 85.55 and the 8 per cent government bond due 2003 rising from 106.95 to
107.80.
US Treasury bonds were firmer yesterday as flagging commodity prices brought
a measure of cheer to the market after a week of sustained weakness.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher
at 90 31/32 .
The yield eased to 6.968 per cent, after ending Friday's session above 7.00
per cent for the first time in 10 months. At the short end, the two-year
note inched  1/32 ahead to 100, yielding 5.108 per cent.
The weekend brought a welcome break in a steady stream of bad news for the
US Treasury market.
At its Geneva meeting, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
raised the prospect of lower oil prices when its members decided to extend
the current production ceiling, rather than reduce output.
The positive scenario for inflation-sensitive fixed-rate investments was
given immediate support yesterday.
In trading on the New York Merchantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery
closed over a dollar lower at Dollars 14.08 a barrel. Prices for gold and
non-oil commodities were also showing big declines.
However, after last week's protracted weakness, the modest rebound in bonds
was hardly encouraging.
Traders appeared to be looking ahead to a batch of crucial economic figures
to be released later in the week. In particular, the market was awaiting
March employment data due out on Friday.
The report will provide hard evidence of the extent to which the economy has
slowed in the first quarter, after an unsettling growth spurt in the final
three months of 1993.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Spanish investors put their
money on mutual funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The total volume of mutual funds under management in Spain grew from
Pta6,627bn to Pta10,709bn during 1993, a rate of expansion which equals the
accumulated growth of the two preceding years.
According to the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores, the stock market
regulator, the number of registered mutual funds rose from 732 to 822 at the
end of last year and the number of participants rose from 900,400 to 1.4m.
The figures bare out the conventional wisdom that people save in times of
recession (Spain registered negative growth last year and gross domestic
product shrank by 1.1 per cent), and save where they will earn most.
In essence, the enthusiasm for mutual funds has been fuelled by three
forces: reduced interest rates, tax incentives and the sheer strength of the
banks' sales drive.
The CNMV believes that investors and those who managed their savings were
showing three clear tendencies:
A switch from short to long-term fixed-income investment. Investment in
long-term public debt increased from 20.8 per cent of the total volume of
the funds at the beginning of last year to 32.8 per cent by December 1993.
A change from fixed-income investment to equities. Spanish funds are
strongly pitched towards government debt but during 1993 the percentage of
total funds estimated to be invested in equities rose from little more than
3 per cent to more than 5 per cent.
A switch from domestic to foreign markets. The weighting of foreign equities
and fixed-income investment among funds increased from 2.2 per cent in 1992
to 5.7 per cent.
This year - in January and February - the rush by investors into mutual
funds accelerated further and the trend into equities was even more
pronounced. By the end of February, the volume of mutual funds had risen to
Pta11,900bn.
One key aspect of the increase in mutual fund investment is the volume
growth (51 per cent) of funds putting all or up to 75 per cent of their
portfolios into equities. As at January 31, equity and equity mixed funds
represented 14.7 per cent of domestic mutual funds under management.
The upsurge in equity-weighted funds represents a huge injection of money
into the Madrid bourse, a market lacking liquidity and domestic
institutional investors.
Ahorro Corporacion Financiera calculates that the combination of equity and
equity mixed funds, together with so-called 'fixed-income mixed' funds,
which allow for a maximum 25 per cent investment in equities, totalled
Pta193bn in January. This compares with average daily trading volume of
Pta42.4bn in equities on the Madrid bourse in January.
According to the CNMV, by the end of this year between 8 per cent and 10 per
cent of total fund volume will be invested in equities. Ahorro Corporacion
Financiera estimates suggest the figure will be closer to 7 per cent.
Either way, the breakdown of the funding volume assures the domestic markets
of a clear, and growing, domestic support base.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Indonesian noodle maker launches rare
exchangeable issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual exchangeable bond offering by Indofood, Indonesia's largest food
company, dominated interest in an otherwise subdued market yesterday.
Dealers described the Dollars 500m offering as 'a difficult transaction',
due to its size and complicated structure.
'The most common comment I heard was good company, but bad pricing and bad
timing,' said one underwriter. 'It's a very unforgiving market at the
moment.' After powering ahead last year, Asia's emerging markets have run
into trouble this year.
The Dollars 500m offering, arranged by UBS, is part of an initial public
offering for the company, which dominates the Indonesian instant noodle
market. Dealers said it is very rare for an exchangeable bond structure to
be used as part of an IPO.
The deal is being brought to the market ahead of a domestic IPO of 20m
shares, due to be launched in April. However, the domestic offering is very
small compared with the 154m shares underlying the international bond
offering.
The interest payments on the exchangeable bonds also have a complicated
structure, with a step-up coupon of 3.5 per cent in the first year, 5 per
cent in the second year and 6 per cent in the third year.
The pricing for the domestic offering is to be set at 15 times earnings  -
the maximum allowed in the domestic market - compared with 23 times
projected 1994 earnings for the bond offering. According to other syndicate
members, the original pricing was between 25 and 29 times earnings, but had
to be lowered.
The final pricing of the international bonds was described as 'not
unreasonable but not cheap', said one underwriter, given the fact that the
gloss has gone off the emerging markets this year. However, the company 'has
a very good story to tell'.
Elsewhere, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone launched a SFr200m deal via Credit
Suisse, and Rabobank Nederland launched a Fl 150m five-year deal via
Rabobank.
Salomon Brothers has signed a Dollars 1bn revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of 16 banks in Europe and North America to provide back-up
financing for its principal operating subsidiaries, Reuter reports from New
York.
The borrower for the secured, committed facility is Salomon Brothers

The main foreign shareholders in the United Bank for Africa (UBA), one of
Nigeria's three biggest commercial banks, have said they aim to pull out of
the bank, Reuter reports from Lagos.
Mr Luke Okafor, UBA's managing director, said Banque Nationale de Paris
Internationale and BNP's UK unit Banque Nationale de Paris which own 30.7
per cent of UBA, have indicated they intended to disinvest but not when. 'It
would not have a negative impact on UBA.'
UBA is 60 per cent owned by Nigerians, with the remaining 9.3 per cent
shares divided between Bankers International of the US and Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro and Monte dei Pashi di Siena, both of Italy.

Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based credit rating agency, said yesterday that it
was considering an upgrade of the senior debt rating of TNT, the Australian
transportation group.
S&amp;P, which currently has the debt rated single-B, said its review follows a
USDollars 150m offering of senior unsecured notes by TNT.
This is the third significant fundraising initiative by the company in the
past six months. The others were a ADollars 318m issue of convertible
preference shares and the ADollars 121m underwritten offering of shares in
Holyman, essentially comprising its shipping division interests.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Brisbane-based metals group, is negotiating to buy a
one-third interest in the Cannington silver-lead mining project which Broken
Hill Proprietary (BHP), the large natural resources group, is exploring in
north-west Queensland.
Melbourne-based BHP discovered the ore-body back in 1990, and is part way
through a feasibility study. It said yesterday that it had been talking for
some time to MIM, which has smelting capacity at Mount Isa, about 200km
north-west of Cannington.
The agreement between the two companies would allow MIM to acquire a 33.3
per cent interest in Cannington, including exploration in a surrounding area
of 50 square kilometres. It would also stipulate that MIM smelt two-thirds
of the total Cannington production of silver-lead concentrate at its
'Isasmelt' plant at Mount Isa. This would be made up of MIM's one-third
share of the total production, plus half of BHP's remaining share, which MIM
would purchase.
Cannington is currently estimated to contain an inferred resource of 47m
tonnes, grading 10.7 per cent lead, 4.6 per cent zinc and 470 grams per
tonne silver. The feasibility study is due to be completed by the end of the
current calender year, and any agreement would take place after that.
Development of a mine would then be due for completion in the 1997 financial
year, with sales commencing in 1988. The expected development cost of the
project has been put at ADollars 225m (USDollars 160m).

Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company, yesterday announced a
reorganisation plan aimed at improving corporate decision-making by reducing
management layers.
The company will cut the number of divisions and departments to 450 from
580, and reorganise its manufacturing and marketing groups into eight
separate internal 'companies' or sections.
The eight internal 'companies' are: consumer audio-visuals; components;
recording media and energy; broadcast products; business and industrial
systems; telecommunications; mobile electronics; and semiconductors.
The section heads will be given more power, overseeing design, manufacturing
and marketing.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the country's largest consumer electronics
maker, announced similar a plan last December. This includes a cut in
administrative personnel to 70 per cent of the previous number by shifting
surplus administrative employees to marketing positions.
Aside from restructuring plans centred on cost-cutting programmes announced
in the past year, Japan's large electronics makers, hit by the recession and
the strong yen, are struggling to revitalise their operations by changes in
organisation, cutting the number of sections and section heads.

<TEXT>
Foster's, the Australian brewing company which owns Courage in the UK,
announced yesterday that the sale of around 15m shares in Broken Hill
Proprietary, a result of the restructuring of the Beswick investment, had
gone ahead at slightly higher than anticipated prices.
As a result, the net cash proceeds to Foster's resulting from the
restructuring deal will be ADollars 251m (USDollars 180.5m) and the brewing
group will book a profit, in effect tax-free, of ADollars 208m.
Beswick, set up in 1988,owns almost one-fifth of BHP's equity and, in turn,
is owned primarily by BHP and Foster's.
Foster's has been keen to realise some of the increased value in the Beswick
investment, which has resulted from the rise in the value of BHP shares over
recent years. BHP, however, has been reluctant to change Beswick's ownership
structure.
The restructuring scheme was devised to satisfy two competing demands. It
provided for the issue to existing Beswick shareholders of new convertible
redeemable preference shares.
Beswick would then sell a small portion of its 322m BHP shares, and use the
proceeds to redeem the bulk of Foster's new preference shares.
The issue of the preference shares had already taken place, but yesterday's
manoeuvres complete the process.
BHP shares closed 26 cents lower at ADollars 17.08.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday
took a step closer to floating its disparate interests in ports when the
company said it would bring together all its port-related interests into one
company.
The company, to be called Hutchison International Port Holdings, will be
headed by Mr John Meredith, the current managing director of Hongkong
International Terminals (HIT). HIT is the principal operator of Hong Kong's
container port and is 77.5 per cent owned by Hutchison.
Over the past two years Hutchison has aggressively expanded its
port-management interests in mainland China. It is an equal partner with the
Shanghai Port Authority, where it operates three container terminals.
It also has port interest in Zhuhai, a special economic zone abutting Macao.
Last year it took the largest share in the development of a Y5bn (Dollars
574.7m) container port at Yantian, on the western fringe of Shenzhen.
Yantian is one of the five ports on China's coast which the government has
nominated for accelerated development.
There has been speculation that the company might want to realise some of
the value in its ports operations by seeking a separate stock exchange
listing.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Gold Fields debates a deep-level
problem - The group's Northam platinum mine needs new funds by June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northam Platinum, the R1.7bn (Dollars 494m) South African platinum mine, is
fast becoming an expensive and embarrassing mistake for parent Gold Fields
of South Africa, the mining house renowned for its deep-level mining
expertise.
Gold Fields raised R1.5bn in equity to finance development at Northam
between 1986 and 1993. The mine ran out of cash last June, secured R200m in
bridging finance, but continues to make operating losses of nearly R10m a
month and will need new funds by June this year if it is to survive.
Gold Fields would appear to have three options: sell Northam, raise more
money, or close the mine.
In mid-1993, Mr Alan Wright, Northam's chairman until last year, approached
Rustenburg Platinum, the world's leading platinum producer, to look at a
closer relationship between Northam and Rusplat's neighbouring Amandelbult
mine.
Rusplat's management investigated and walked away. The company was
unenthused about acquiring extra high-cost capacity, with platinum and
rhodium prices near historic lows due to overcapacity at South African mines
and slack demand for the metals from European and Japanese carmakers, which
need them for catalytic converters.
Northam is the world's deepest platinum mine, with shafts sunk to more than
2,000 metres. The temperature of the virgin rock underground can exceed
70`C, requiring extensive cooling, while the depth at which the ore is being
mined pushes up production costs compared with rival South African
producers, some of which are open-cast operations.
Gold Fields introduced water-powered rock drills at Northam, which have
proved mechanically efficient - with the bonus that the water they use for
power helps cool the underground working environment to about 20 degrees.
Management insisted in the past that the relatively high cost of extracting
platinum would be more than offset by the richness of the ore, originally
estimated to have an average in situ grade of 10.1 grammes a tonne.
Northam's production costs 'should be the lowest in the industry', Mr Wright
said in July 1992.
That estimate has proved the mine's Achilles' heel. The in situ grade at
neighbouring Amandelbult is only 7.5 grammes, and suspicion that Northam's
would be no better gained weight when Northam announced it would widen
underground stopes, inevitably leading to the extraction of more low-grade
ore. Northam achieved average grades of only 5.4 grammes in 1993.
Poor grades have been been aggravated by difficult mining conditions,
ranging from large volumes of underground water to faulting on the reef,
which left Northam a year behind its production target of 150,000 tonnes of
ore a month. Northam's poor performance dented incentive bonuses employees
were expecting in December. That led to an exodus of skilled and
semi-skilled workers and an influx of new staff, just as pressure to meet
production targets intensified.
Mr John Hopwood, Northam's new chairman, says better metal prices would help
but are not a solution to the mine's problems. 'I cannot put a percentage on
the chances of Northam's survival. Even if we get the tonnage up to 150,000,
the mine's future is critically dependent on achieving better grades.
Increased stope widths, more development work and other mining factors are
all diluting the in situ grades we thought we would achieve.'
'Northam has reached make or break,' says Mr Philip Marillier, mining
analyst at stockbrokers Edey Rogers. While management can be forgiven for
not predicting how low the platinum price would fall - the price averaged
Dollars 466 an ounce the year the mine was launched, rising to more than
Dollars 560 in the late 1980s, but yesterday stood at Dollars 412 - Gold
Fields underestimated the difficulty of mining a platinum-bearing reef
compared with the gold-bearing reefs it was used to, Mr Marillier says.
He agrees selling Northam is unlikely, but closure may be unthinkable too,
because of the investment Gold Fields has made. However, raising new funds
is far from simple.
New loan finance, assuming Northam's bankers were willing, would further
compromise the mine's chances of showing a profit by adding to its interest
burden. A fourth rights offer would take place in a bear-market for
platinum. Northam shares are trading at R6.50 compared with their most
recent high of R19.50.
Sceptics point out there is little public interest in the share, so Gold
Fields would have to take up most of the new scrip, perhaps requiring a
rights issue of its own to foot the bill. The success of that would depend
on the goodwill of the mining house's institutional shareholders, the
Rembrandt group and assurer Liberty Life, who might be tiring of throwing
good money after bad.
However, Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of Liberty Life, notes that the group,
which has assets of more than R83bn, acquired its stake in Gold Fields in
1989, after Minorco's abortive take-over bid for Consolidated Gold Fields.
Mr Gordon says: 'The reason we invest in Gold Fields is for gold mining, and
we are confident that the gold market will go from strength to strength in
the years ahead. 'We did not invest in Gold Fields because of Northam, and,
in any case, we get paid for underwriting.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recession holds Malbak to 5%
rise at halfway
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malbak, the South African industrial conglomerate recently unbundled from
mining house Gencor, has reported a sluggish 5 per cent increase in pre-tax
profit to R341m (Dollars 99m) in the half-year to February 28, against R325m
in the same period in 1992.
Sales grew by 8 per cent to R5.81bn from R5.39bn, but the lingering effects
of the country's recession dented profitability, with operating income
falling to R384m from R388m.
Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman, said: 'The past six months have been
characterised by sporadic bursts of consumer spending interspersed with
periods of stagnation.'
Mr Thomas said a general decline in consumer demand knocked sales volumes
and operating margins, aggravated by the group's large cash balances which
earned less revenue as interest rates declined in the period. Malbak's cash
in hand stood at R887m at the end of the period, compared with R675m a year
earlier.
Distributable profit rose to R179m from R170m after a reduction in net
interest charges and lower tax provisions. Results were most disappointing
from Foodcorp, the group's wide-ranging foods producer, and Holdains, the
group's packaging subsidiary, which contributed R34m and R27m to bottom line
earnings compared with R33m and R29m respectively a year ago.
Results were buoyed by the group's branded consumer products operations, led
by its furniture business Ellerines and electronic appliance subsidiary
Tedelex, which returned to profitability. They contributed earnings of R37m,
compared with R23m in 1992.
Mr Thomas said SA Druggists, the pharmaceutical products subsidiary, had an
'excellent' half-year.
International operations, led by London-quoted MY Holdings, had a
satisfactory period. The company acquired Insight Cartons, a UK folding
carton business, while Malbak would reduce its stake to 67 per cent from
85.7 per cent when the deal was completed and move the company from the
London Stock Exchange's unlisted securities market to the main board to
improve the marketability of the shares.

The share issue to sell the Danish government's 25 per cent stake in
Copenhagen airport was oversubscribed 3.3 times, the ministry of
communications said yesterday.
An indicative price of DKr285 to DKr315 was placed on the 2.25m shares on
offer when the issue opened.
The final offer price was fixed at DKr310 and the yield from the issue will
be DKr697m (Dollars 106m). The shares will be listed on the Copenhagen Stock
Exchange from April 11.
All international bids will be honoured in full, as will domestic bids for
less than 300 shares. Bids for more than 300 shares will receive 300 shares
plus two thirds of the rest.
Mr Henning Birch, chief executive of Topdanmark, the insurance group,
resigned at the weekend after criticism of the group's performance from
leading institutional shareholders and in the Danish media.
He was replaced by Mr Kaj G. Schou, who has been in charge of the group's
accident insurance company.
Shareholder criticism of Topdanmark has centred on Top's acquisition of a
regional bank, Aktivbanken, in 1989.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grumman, which this month became the subject of a Dollars 2bn takeover
battle between fellow defence groups Martin Marietta and Northrop, yesterday
tried to lay down procedures for an unusually rapid auction of the company,
calling on both sides to submit their best bids by 5pm this Thursday.
Grumman, which makes defence electronics and military aircraft, laid down
the bidding procedure in letters sent to both Martin Marietta and Northrop.
Grumman agreed on March 7 to a friendly Dollars 1.9bn, or Dollars 55 a
share, bid from Martin Marietta. However, Northrop, with which Grumman had
held several months of secret takeover discussions, then launched a hostile
Dollars 60 a share bid, worth Dollars 2.04bn.
In spite of Grumman's initial enthusiasm for a deal with Martin Marietta,
the board is required by law to obtain the best value for shareholders, and
yesterday's statement represented its first acknowledgement that the company
will be sold to the highest bidder.
US takeover battles can last for many months but Grumman yesterday sought to
impose a very short timetable, arguing that a prolonged process would
disrupt its business.
It said it wanted a single and final round of bidding, with each company
submitting its best offer by 5pm on March 31. Grumman would not disclose the
offers until it had accepted one of them, and the bidders would keep their
offers confidential and on the table until 9am on Monday April 4. It
reserved the right to change the rules.
Analysts noted that it might be hard for Grumman to stick to its timetable
if one or other bidder demanded more time to produce a higher bid, since a
raised offer would be in shareholders' best interests.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kodak chief launches shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Fisher, who took over last December as chairman of Eastman Kodak,
the photographic products company, yesterday announced one of his first
significant moves to shake up the business - the formation of a new unit to
spearhead its involvement in the emerging market for electronic imaging.
Mr Fisher, former chief executive of electronics group Motorola, took over
at Kodak when unrest over the company's lacklustre earnings led to the
resignation of the chairman, Mr Kaye Whitmore.
Most of Kodak's photographic earnings come from traditional film, which
utilises a chemical process, the sensitivity to light from silver halide
salts. However, Kodak has long feared that this business could ultimately be
superseded by the rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging.
Kodak is itself a significant force in electronic imaging - for example in
its invention (together with Philips of the Netherlands) of the photo CD
system. But critics said that under the previous management they were
uncertain as to how much clout the electronic side carried within the group,
as well as lines of command.
Kodak said yesterday it was forming a separate worldwide unit for digital
and applied imaging and was searching outside the company for someone to
head the operation.
It will initially comprise several existing Kodak businesses - applied
imaging, CD imaging, printer products and the company's equipment and
software platform centre.
Mr Jack Thomas, president of Kodak's imaging group, said 'our traditional
businesses will continue to furnish the majority of our earnings for a long
time. However, fuelled by digital technology, digital imaging is growing
faster than conventional photography'.

Intel, the world's leading producer of computer chips, plans to form a
technology partnership with China's largest electronics company. The aim is
to establish Intel's microprocessor technology as the standard for personal
computers in China.
In an agreement to be signed today, China Electronics Corporation (CEC) will
promote Intel microprocessors in China. In return, Intel will contract with
Huajing Electronics, a CEC subsidiary, to test and assemble Intel 386SX
microprocessors and microcontroller chips at its plant in China.
The US company will deliver the devices to China in the form of
pre-processed silicon wafers. Huajing Electronics will dice the wafers,
package and test them, and the microprocessor chips will be used in personal
computers and point-of-sale equipment.
The joint venture is a pre-emptive move to take advantage of the emerging
personal computer market in China, Intel said. The US chip maker regards
China as a market with huge potential. Currently, the majority of computers
used in China are based on Intel microprocessors: most, however, are
imported.
China Electronics is that country's largest electronics enterprise group,
with assets of Yn7.8bn (Dollars 896.6m).
In another move to promote its technology, Intel has donated 40 computers
based on its latest high-powered Pentium chips to the Qinghua and Beijing
universities.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ford adds Mystique to its
Dollars 6bn global ambitions - The company's attempt to repeat its European
success in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford Motor's Dollars 6bn programme to create a 'global car' - one that can
be sold successfully around the world - reaches an important test tomorrow
when a US version of the vehicle is officially unveiled at the New York
Automobile Show.
The global car, some six years in the making, was introduced first in
Europe, where it went on sale last year under the name Mondeo. It was a big
hit.
The Mondeo was named 1994 European car of the year by a panel of motoring
journalists and has been the best-selling vehicle in its class each month
since the launch.
The question now is whether Ford can repeat this success in the far more
crowded and competitive US car market, where the global car will be known as
the Ford Contour (the version being launched in New York) and the Mercury
Mystique, and will square up against strong selling mid-sized vehicles such
as the Nissan Altima and Pontiac Grand Am.
A lot may be riding on the answer. For if the Contour is successful, it may
encourage Ford to repeat its global vehicle experiment - shrugging off
criticism in the motor industry about the high cost and long time spent
developing the vehicle.
While the car is rather conservatively styled, many analysts think it will
sell well. Mr Christopher Cedergren, of the Auto Pacific consultancy, says
the Contour offers good 'drive-ability,' refined fitments and should be
attractively priced. 'I think it will do fine. Ford might even need to put
extra capacity in place.'
The company is planning to sell around 300,000 units a year in North
America, from plants in Kansas City, Missouri and Cuautitlan, Mexico, on top
of some 400,000 in Europe. In all, it aims to sell nearly 800,000 a year in
59 countries around the world.
Whatever the outcome, Ford is hailing the global car programme as an
important step in its transformation from a multi-national - one which is in
many markets around the world, but serves them independently - into a
globally integrated business, making the best use of its resources on a
worldwide basis.
Traditionally, the world's leading car manufacturers have made a vehicle for
one particular market - the US, Japan or Europe - and if the vehicle has
been successfully sold abroad, it has been later modified to cope with
differing tastes and government-imposed safety and emission standards. Many
companies have toyed with the idea of building a global car because in
theory it promises some big savings: manufacturers do not have to duplicate
design and engineering for different markets, while the larger volume brings
economies of scale.
None, however, has gone so far as Ford. Ford of Europe was primarily
responsible for the basic engineering of the car and integrating its
components and sub-systems. Its new V6 engine and automatic transmission
were engineered in the US, which also provided air conditioning expertise.
The design originated from four design centres - one in Italy, one in
Germany and two in the US.
This international co-operation imposed huge logistical problems, solved by
the establishment of a complex video-conferencing system and by the purchase
of a Cray super-computer, which allowed engineers on either side of the
Atlantic to work on drawings simultaneously.
Around 90 per cent of the parts of the vehicle that the driver does not see
 -such as the underbody, suspension and powertrain - are common to both the
European and US versions, although significant changes were made to the
visible parts to cope with differing European and American tastes.
Mr John Oldfield, the Briton who was project manager for the programme, says
'each car has more features to satisfy customers than if it had been
designed only for one market'.
Ford says another benefit of the project has been a big improvement in its
global sourcing of parts. The project has only 227 suppliers, compared with
over 700 for the Tempo and Topaz models which it replaces in the US, and
Ford signed long-term supply contracts early in the Mondeo/Contour
programme.
Mr Oldfield says the experience so far 'gives us a lot of confidence that
(the theoretical) cost reductions from global programmes are real'.
The start-up of production in Kansas City is also proceeding more smoothly
than previous launches, since Ford is drawing on the experience of 38
engineers, brought over from Europe, who were involved in the Mondeo
start-up there.
However, the six years spent developing the car is long by world standards.
Ford normally aims to get new vehicles on the street in 24 to 48 months.
The company says this was due to the steep learning curve on the Mondeo and
its next world car will be developed much more rapidly.
Motor industry critics also point out that this experience has come at a
very high price. The Dollars 6bn bill is roughly double what Ford spent in
the mid-1980s developing its Taurus car, arguably the most successful US car
of the past decade. Chrysler spent only Dollars 1.6bn developing its popular
new line of LH vehicles. They question whether Ford can make money on the
Mondeo/Contour.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman, insists that 'whatever else this programme
does for us, you can rest assured that it will earn us profits. Real, fully
accounted profits. Anything you hear to the contrary is probably just
wishful thinking on the part of our competition.'
Mr Trotman also points out that Ford is getting more for its money than the
three new models - for example, two new engines and transmissions which will
be used in other vehicles, new air conditioning expertise and an improved
global communications network.
'But our investment is in much more than hardware,' he adds. 'We've been
buying a new way of doing business for the long term.'
And he insists Ford will build another world car - with another mid-sized
vehicle the most likely candidate - although he declines to say when or
what.
Even so, he reckons it will take Ford another 10 years to 'complete all we
have to do' to become a truly global manufacturer. But he is no doubt hoping
that it will still put it many years ahead of its rivals.

The turnround at Air Canada continued in the first quarter of this year and
the loss would be much smaller than that of a year earlier, said Mr Jean
Jacques Bourgeault, chief operating officer.
'The second quarter should also be better and the third, our best, will be
profitable. For all 1994 we should at least break even at the bottom line
and return to profitability in 1995,' he said.
In 1993, Air Canada reported operating profit of CDollars 77m (USDollars
57.4m), but after restructuring provisions saw a final loss of CDollars
326m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Toyama Chemical warns on profits
after price cuts

<TEXT>
Toyama Chemical, a medium-sized Japanese pharmaceuticals group, has issued a
profit warning after the ministry of health and welfare imposed a 12 per
cent price cut on its medicines.
The announcement underlines the crisis gripping the Japanese pharmaceuticals
industry.
The company reduced its pre-tax profits forecast for the financial year
ending this month to Y2.8bn (Dollars 26m) from Y3.6bn and said it would make
only Y2.2bn next financial year.
A poor performance by its new medicines and a deterioration in antibiotic
sales were to blame for the undershoot this year, according to the company.
It said the profits fall next year would be because of the ministry's price
cuts and the absence of any new products.
The company generates 70 per cent its turnover from antibiotics, a class of
drugs which were particularly badly affected by the price cuts announced
earlier this month.
The fall in profits next year would be in spite of a cost-cutting plan which
includes reducing the 2,200 workforce by 300, said Toyama.
In April last year Toyama announced it would merge with Mitsui
Pharmaceutical, another Japanese drugs group. However, the deal fell through
after a Toyama subsidiary, Yuho Kasei, was declared bankrupt.

market leader Rodamco and slightly ahead of Wereldhave, which is ranked
second.
VIB, with market capitalisation of around Fl 1.6bn, is to offer five of its

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Oerlikon-Buhrle jumps 69%
despite sales drop

<TEXT>
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retailing group, has
reported a 69 per cent jump in net income to SFr63m (Dollars 43.4m),
continuing its recovery from six years of losses to 1991.
The recovery was achieved in spite of a 16 per cent drop in consolidated
sales and a 37 per cent slide in operating profit to Sfr147m. These declines
were mainly due to delays in deliveries of Contraves anti-aircraft missiles
and Pilatus trainer aircraft.
Oerlikon said it reduced its debt during the year by SFr258m to SFr1.18bn,
and net financing costs were halved to SFr64m.
The directors said the finances of the holding company had been restored so
it should be able to secure formal approval for dividend payments to be
resumed next year.
The last year for which the group paid dividends was 1985.
Forbo, the leading European floor and wall coverings maker, said
consolidated net income rose 20 per cent last year to SFr55.4m in spite of a
5 per cent slide in sales to SFr1.7bn.
Sales were down in all European countries except Germany, where they were
flat, and Belgium, where they were up 4 per cent.
Concentration on higher margin products, cost-cutting, stable raw material
prices and falling interest rates all contributed to the growth in profits.
Forbo said prospects for 1994 were 'promising' and it continued to seek
further geographic expansion of its core activities.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Porsche manoeuvres for space - A
look at the German carmaker's attempts to carry on the battle with the
Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Stuttgart lies a battered Porsche in a pool of red. It is not a car but
the company.
Porsche, whose products have been synonymous with the words sports car since
the first 356 model rolled out of its Zuffenhausen plant in the 1950s, has
been losing money heavily in the past three years. Its annual sales have
plunged from a peak of 50,000-plus in the late 1980s to just over 14,000
last year.
However, Dr Wendelin Wiedeking, the chief executive, insists not only that
the damage is mostly superficial but that, refuelled by the DM200m (Dollars
118m) rights issue launched earlier this month it will soon be once again
zooming along at the head of the world sports car pack.
'Porsche is not going to leave the world sports car market to the Japanese,'
he says.
Bald statistics suggest Porsche has not been having much choice in the
matter.
Last year it built just 12,500 cars compared with 50,000 in the mid-1980s.
It sold 14,300; so at least surplus stock was being mopped up. But it is a
measure of decline that in the US, the world's most important sports car
market, only 3,700 were sold compared with peaks of 30,000.
Its half-year results show that its car sales are at last turning up - the
increase was 19 per cent over the year-ago period. Even so, when the current
financial year ends in July, Porsche will have lost DM450m since 1991.
It took nearly a decade for the world at large - or at least that portion of
it with cheque books fat enough to warrant an interest - to conclude Porsche
was the sports car market's emperor without clothes.
Through most of the 1980s, as the whizz-kids of the financial markets in
their thousands swelled Porsche's more traditional - and historically much
smaller - customer base, it enjoyed cult status, based on the entirely solid
foundations of its proud competition record and high quality. Two-thirds of
all Porsches ever made are claimed still to be operational.
However, Porsche began to believe the hype. Even in the enthusiast motoring
press, it was getting away with making minor changes to its three-model
range, grandiosely proclaiming them to be new and receiving an uncritical,
adulatory response.
Development of the fundamentally new products which are any car maker's
long-term survival ticket languished, eventually the respected Car magazine
commented: 'For the first time in my life Porsche is no longer interesting.
Porsche is quite literally an also-ran. A maker of terribly old cars.'
However, Dr Wiedeking is adamant that Porsche will escape the fate towards
which previous management policies were leading it: a retreat ever further
upmarket into more expensive products and dwindling volumes until there was
nowhere left to run.
A new two-seater, the Boxster, is to be launched in 1996 selling for
DM70,000 to DM80,000 - the sports car market heartland where Japan is
enjoying most success.
The Boxster, predicts Dr Wiedeking, will achieve 16,000 sales a year. The
996, successor to the 30-year-old 911, will be launched a year later.
Together, he insists, they will make Porsche a viable producer of about
30,000 cars annually investing regularly in new products - the lack of which
has been at the core of Porsche's malaise.
Finances will be further underpinned by assembling cars for other
manufacturers, already being done with Mercedes and Audi. Some 2,000 will be
built this year and the practice is to become a fundamental profit centre,
with talks also currently going on with non-German car makers.
In this scenario, continued independence under the Porsche and Piech
families would be assured, Dr Wiedeking maintains.
Introducing the two new Porsche models will cost DM1.5bn. That Porsche is
rich enough to do so - helped by the impending DM200m rights issue - is
itself a pointer to past under-investment.
Dr Wiedeking has spent little more than a year in the job. But he has
replaced almost the entire board, stripped top management from six to four
layers, reorganised the global sales organisation and ejected or redeployed
about a third of the management structure.
'He has put a bomb under the whole organisation and even admits to having
changed senior managers' functions for no reason other than to make them
feel uncomfortable', observes Mr Nick Snee, analyst with SG Warburg.
Dr Wiedeking talks confidently of returning to break-even next year and of
decent profits by 1997.
However, according to Mr Uwe Loos, production director, 'we have to use the
crisis to change things, not just saw off heads'. Much of a 30 per cent
costs cut since 1991 has come from almost 2,000 job cuts. But Mr Loos is
counting on the rapid establishment of a continuous improvement mentality to
generate enduring competitive benefits.
Component costs have to be brought down by an average 30 per cent and
supplier numbers from 900 to about 300. That process is going ahead
ruthlessly. Porsche says it wants change through partnership. But of 190
suppliers who have already been reassessed, 144 have been shown the door.
According to Mr Loos, new suppliers have cut the cost of instrument panels
and front seats by 80 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Production time
for a 911 is almost 30 per cent lower than in mid-1991. The current 85
man-hours per car (50 among Japanese rivals) is to be cut to 60 by 1995.
Most visible change is on the Zuffenhausen factory floor, where advisers
Shin-Gijutsu, led by Toyota's former top engineer, Mr Yoshiki Iwata, have
had free rein to make improvements. Dr Wiedeking maintains that workers are
backing rationalisation unreservedly, after initial scepticism, and
producing 'amazing' results.
The new management's concern is to embed the philosophy of continuous
improvement firmly enough to ensure that it will survive - even if, as it
suspects, the workforce becomes less flexible when the worst of the crunch
is past.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Horsham pays CDollars 600m for
controlling stake in Trizec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Horsham, the investment group controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter
Munk, has cast a vote of confidence in the North American property market by
agreeing to invest CDollars 600m (USDollars 454m) in Trizec, the continent's
biggest publicly-traded real estate developer.
Horsham will acquire a stake of at least 43 per cent in Trizec, ousting
Toronto's Bronfman family as the controlling shareholder. The deal is
conditional on completion of a capital restructuring which Trizec began last
August, involving about CDollars 1.5bn of its CDollars 4.8bn debt.
The agreement marks another step in the rapid decline of the Bronfman
empire, which was once the colossus of Canadian business but has lost
control over the past 18 months of flagship assets in the forest-products,
brewing, financial-services and packaging sectors.
With a war chest of more than USDollars 1bn, Horsham has been looking for an
investment to complement its controlling interests in American Barrick, the
Toronto-based gold producer, and Clark Refining and Marketing, a US mid-west
oil distributor.
Horsham made a foray into the German property market three years ago by
buying a large commercial site on the outskirts of Berlin. However,
development has been slower than expected.
It said the investment in Trizec was based on a view of the company's
long-term prospects. Trizec's future would be enhanced by access to
Horsham's international contacts and its expertise in innovative financing
techniques.
Trizec has stakes in 85 properties, mostly office buildings and shopping
malls, covering 54m sq ft. More than three-quarters of its properties are in
the US.
Debenture holders and other creditors have so far rejected Trizec's
restructuring proposals, and have threatened to demand accelerated payment
of their securities.
The company this month obtained a court order which prevented senior
debenture holders from enforcing their rights pending the outcome of talks
with Horsham.
Horsham will advance an initial CDollars 500m, which will be used to retire
a large portion of Trizec's senior debentures. The remaining CDollars 100m
will comprise 50 per cent of a planned CDollars 200m rights offering, whose
proceeds will be used to strengthen Trizec's balance sheet.
Trizec will issue warrants exercisable for 20 per cent of the new shares
over four years. Horsham will take up 43 per cent of the warrants.
Trizec expects to draw up a new debt-restructuring proposal by the end of
April, with the aim of putting it in place by June 30.
Mr Kevin Benson, Trizec's chairman, said yesterday the deal would allow
Trizec to offer shares to some debenture holders, but to offer 'a
substantial portion of cash' to others who have been reluctant to accept
equity in exchange for their debt securities.
The company indicated it would ask the courts for a further period of
protection from debenture holders while it draws up an information circular
and arranges votes by various classes of creditors and shareholders.

Arbed, the Luxembourg steel manufacturer, is to sell its 50.05 per cent
stake in Ciments Luxembourgeois to the German company Dyckerhoff.
Arbed refused to reveal how much the German company, which currently owns
17.5 per cent of Ciments Luxembourgeois, had paid for the stake. But it said
that Dyckerhoff would now be seeking to pursue a policy of 'modernisation
and expansion' for the Luxembourg cement company.
Arbed yesterday unveiled a total consolidated loss of LFr5.7 bn (Dollars
158.3m) for 1993, compared to a loss of LFr2.9bn in 1992. The group loss,
excluding minorities, was LFr4.7bn, against LFr2.9bn the previous year.

FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann offers Vox shares to
Disney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bertelsmann, the German media group, is hopeful of selling Walt Disney a 49
per cent stake in Germany's Vox television channel, which will go into
liquidation on April 1 unless the holding can be sold.
'The main negotiations are being conducted solely with Disney,' said Mr
Manfred Harnischfeger, a spokesman for Bertelsmann, adding that a decision
has to be reached by Friday.
Vox went on air in January 1993 with more than 300 employees, but its mix of
films, current affairs and news made no inroads on viewing figures and for
months the future of the Cologne-based channel has hung in the balance.
A collapse of Vox would be a blow for Bertelsmann, one of the world's
largest media groups, which holds a 24.9 per cent stake in the venture. The
failure of Vox would also be the first set-back for Mr Mark Wossner,
Bertelsmann's chief executive and until now regarded as one of Germany's
most successful businessmen.
If the Disney deal goes ahead, the remaining 26.1 per cent would be held on
trust for future disposal. Under broadcasting laws, Bertelsmann is unable to
raise its stake in Vox because it already owns significant stakes in the
highly-successful RTL channel and in Premiere, Germany's first pay-TV
channel.
Vox shareholders are estimated to have lost about DM360m (Dollars 204.5m) in
1993 and stand to lose a total of DM630m if the channel goes into
liquidation.

Losses at GR (Holdings), the leisure and fitness, property and sheepskin
processing concern, rose from Pounds 124,753 to Pounds 216,882 over the half
year ended December 31.
The deficit took account of a provision against costs of joint interests
amounting to Pounds 121,782 (nil) and a loss on investments of Pounds 98,518
(nil).
Directors said the second half loss was likely to be slightly in excess of
the Pounds 333,000 recorded for the same period of the previous year.

interim dividend is held at 0.4p. Losses per share emerged at 2.3p (1.3p).

In line with the company's forecast at the interim stage, James Fisher, the
Cumbria-based shipping group, suffered a further deterioration in trading in
the second half and ended the year in the red.
The loss on ordinary activities before a tax credit was Pounds 5.63m,
against a profit of Pounds 1.49m last year. Turnover fell by 8 per cent to
Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 31.1m).
Sir David Hardy, chairman, said that the outcome had been worsened by the
need to add a number of provisions during the period.
After the tax credit, which amounted to Pounds 1.84m (Pounds 847,000
charge), losses per share came out at 15.76p (2.66p earnings). There is no
dividend this time (last year's pay-out totalled 1p).

A 'steady improvement' in trading conditions in its core business of

House of Fraser, the 56-store department store group, said yesterday the
public element of its flotation was 2.2 times subscribed, and larger
applications would be scaled down.
The group placed 172.2m ordinary shares, 75 per cent of the total, firm with
institutional investors.
It offered 57.4m shares to the public, and received applications for 126.87m
shares from more than 112,000 applicants.
Applications for 200 to 400 shares will be allotted in full, but
applications for more will receive only partial allocations. Those applying
for 3,000 to a million shares will get 25 per cent, and applicants for more
than a million will get 20 per cent.
Eligible employees, pensioners and directors applied for a total of 897,700
ordinary shares under a preferential offer. Their applications will be
satisfied in full.
The Fayed brothers, owners of House of Fraser, are selling all the shares in
the group, valuing it at Pounds 413.3m, but are keeping its former flagship
Harrods.
In the 'grey market' made by IG Index, the London financial bookmaker, the
shares were quoted at 190 1/2 p yesterday, against the offer price of 180p,
after dropping to 185 1/2 p on Friday.

Continental

<TEXT>
A 3-for-7 rights issue to raise IPounds 29.2m (Pounds 28.1m) has been
announced by the Irish Continental Group, which operates ferry and shipping
services from Ireland to the UK and the continent.
The issue price of 400p on the 7.57m new shares represents a 13 per cent
discount on yesterday's average trading price of 460p. The issue is being
underwritten by AIB Capital Markets.
Proceeds will be used to finance the building of a new ferry to operate on
the Dublin-Holyhead route, which will replace a chartered vessel with one
with more than twice the capacity.
The company said that capacity constraints on the route had created
opportunities for expansion to 'capture a significant portion of the freight
transport originating in the Republic of Ireland currently being routed
through Northern Ireland ports'.
The annual financing costs of the new ferry would be no greater than the
chartering costs of the existing chartered ferry, the company said.
The Irish Sea routes have become increasingly competitive. The port of
Larne, north of Belfast, with its short sea crossing to Britain and frequent
sailings schedule, has posed a challenge to operators out of ports in the
Republic. Larne handles an estimated 20 per cent of all roll-on roll-off
vehicle traffic for the Republic crossing the Irish Sea.
Stena Sealink, is one of ICG's main competitors, and is planning its own
expansion on the Dublin-Holyhead route this summer, upgrading its catamaran
ferry service in June to be followed by the introduction on the route of the
world's largest high-speed ferry in spring 1995.
The new ICG ferry, and Stena Sealink's new high-speed vessel, will have
capacity to carry 100 and 50 trucks respectively. However, government plans
to alleviate traffic congestion in Dublin are unlikely to materialise until
towards the end of the decade.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Argent to float with more than Pounds 150m
value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Argent Group, a private property concern which has pursued an aggressive
expansion programme over the last three years, is to float this summer with
a market value of more than Pounds 150m.
Shares will be offered to the public as well as placed with institutions.
The group intends to use the proceeds to 'take advantage of development
opportunities beyond our current scope'. Argent said development would only
be undertaken if the building was pre-let or sold.
Argent is the private vehicle of brothers Michael and Peter Freeman.
Between 1991 and 1993 the group bought 15 of its 16 properties with the help
of its joint venture partner, Warburg Pincus, the US venture capital
concern.
The group's properties have recently been valued at Pounds 195m and pro
forma net assets are estimated at Pounds 115m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik raises more to exploit gold mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bakyrchik Gold, which raised Pounds 9m in London last August to exploit a
gold mine in Kazakhstan, once part of the Soviet Union, has raised a further
Pounds 2.25m net to expand the first stage of the project.
Some 750,000 new shares, representing about 5 per cent of the increased
capital, have been conditionally placed with institutional investors by
William de Broe at 300p each.
Last August Bakyrchik shares were placed at 120p, since when they have been
as high as 405p.
Mr Kevin Foo, chief executive, said the new cash would be used for a bigger
treatment plant so that annual gold output in the first stage of the project
would be 46,000 troy ounces compared with the 35,000 to 40,000 first
envisaged.
The feasibility study for a second stage, to take output to 230,000 ounces a
year, was due to be completed in May and, subject to this being satisfactory
and a successful start-up of the stage one plant, Bakyrchik would raise
another Pounds 75m later in 1994. Most of this would be via new equity.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rutland 65% ahead at Pounds 10.9m - Sale of
a stake in its soft drinks business helped fuel the advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of part of its soft drinks business helped Rutland Trust, the
financial and business services group, to boost pre-tax profits by 65 per
cent for the year to end-December.
They rose from Pounds 6.67m to Pounds 10.9m on turnover of Pounds 100m
(Pounds 94m). The latest turnover figure includes Pounds 5.1m from
acquisitions.
Early this year Rutland sold part of Ben Shaw's, the Yorkshire soft drinks
manufacturer, 84 per cent of which it acquired last August for Pounds 5.7m.
The buyer was Cott Corporation of Canada, the rapidly expanding North
American soft drinks company, which paid Pounds 6m for 51 per cent of the
Pontefract canning line. The latest pre-tax figure includes Pounds 3.3m
profit on the sale.
Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said the group would realise a further
Pounds 3m of profits in the current year from a second payment from Cott,
which has the option to raise its stake in the canning line to 82.5 per
cent.
Rutland will retain the remaining 17.5 per cent, and will continue to own
and develop the Huddersfield division of Ben Shaw's, which concentrates on
the local returnable soft drinks market and spring water production.
Operating profits from the corporate finance and investment division, which
did the Ben Shaw's deal, rose from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2m. This mainly
reflected a Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 904,000) contribution from the group's 42
per cent stake in Capital Industries, the laminated paper maker.
The asset financing division, which is involved in vehicle contract hire,
doubled operating profits from Pounds 858,000 to Pounds 1.72m on the back of
improved second-hand car values.
Profits from professional services, including Ellis &amp; Buckle, the loss
adjuster, eased from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 3.92m.
At the year end the group had Pounds 14.6m cash. Mr Langdon said Rutland
would continue to look for suitable acquisi-tions.
Earnings per share rose from 1.68p to 3.17p, or 1.97p excluding the
exceptional item. A final dividend of 0.6p (0.53p) is proposed, making the
total for the year 0.87p (0.8p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baronsmead, the venture capital group, is launching a venture capital
investment trust based on an existing Pounds 12.75m portfolio of cash and
unquoted investments held by Baronsmead Development Capital Partners.
The fund was started in 1988 as MIM Development Capital Partners. Baronsmead
acquired control of the managers, Invesco Ventures, in May 1993. The new
trust, Baronsmead Investment Trust, will continue to invest mainly in
established UK unquoted companies involved in management buy-outs or
buy-ins.
The trust will have an initial life of 10 years. The assets are to be
transferred from the partnership to the new trust in exchange for 12.75m
ordinary shares at 100p, and 1.91m warrants, exercisable at 100p between
1997 and 2001. Dealings in both are expected to start on March 31.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan back in black with
Pounds 7.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Metropolitan, Scotland's largest property company, yesterday
announced a return to profitability.
It announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.16m for the six months to February
15, compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.18m for the comparable period.
Mr Scott Cairns, managing director, was 'cautiously optimistic.'
Although property values are increasing, demand from tenants is still weak,
he said. 'The letting markets are very tough,' he added.
The turnround in profitability resulted from a Pounds 5.05m gain on the sale
of investment property, together with a reduction in net interest costs from
Pounds 8.84m to Pounds 5.22m.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 9.51m to Pounds 7.33m, mainly as a result
of loss of revenue from buildings that were sold.
The company's borrowings have fallen from Pounds 144.9m last August to
Pounds 67.9m on February 15.
During the period, the company raised Pounds 26.8m through a rights issue
and sold six investment properties for Pounds 55.3m, showing a 10 per cent
surplus over book value.
In the second half of the year the company plans to sell buildings worth
between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m, mainly in the south of England, as it
implements its strategy of increasing its emphasis on Scottish prop-erty.
It has spent Pounds 8.9m on acquisitions of industrial and retail property
since the half-year end and has about Pounds 50m of unused facilities for
further acquisitions as opportunities arise.
Earnings per share were 6.19p, compared with losses of 1.32p.
The interim dividend is lifted from 0.4p to 0.5p.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Headlam surges to Pounds 3.7m on the back
of acquisition profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Headlam, the acquisitive fabrics and flooring distribution group, yesterday
reported a sharp increase in annual profits following first-time
contributions by new subsidiaries.
For the year to end-December pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds
1.1m) on turnover up from Pounds 58.8m to Pounds 107m.
The group, which has acquired 13 companies in the past two years, said
full-year profits from 1992 acquisitions and partial contributions from
subsidiaries purchased last year boosted operating profits to Pounds 4.52m
(Pounds 1.72m).
Mr Ian Kirkham, chief executive, said the fabrics division had enjoyed the
sharpest growth with profits increasing from Pounds 705,000 to Pounds 2.4m.
The flooring division - enlarged by acquisitions in Scotland and the
Midlands during the year - contributed Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.4m) to group
operating profits.
'It has captured 15 per cent of the national distribution market despite a
fairly flat UK market place,' said Mr Kirkham.
Improved performances by both divisions were offset by a Pounds 242,000 loss
at R Coggins, the footwear business, which was sold off last year.
While concentrating on its core businesses, the group is also understood to
be considering an expansion into furnishing fabrics - a sector where it has
identified several possible acquisitions. Such purchases would be financed
from borrowings or net cash of Pounds 3.6m left over from the group's Pounds
5.1m rights issue last year.
Earnings increased to 8p (3.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 2.35p makes
a 3.2p (2.6p) total.

Operating profits advanced from Pounds 3.28m to Pounds 4.43m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth in investment trusts helps EFM
double to Pounds 9.78m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record year for the fund management industry is reflected in good results
from Edinburgh Fund Managers, which more than doubled pre-tax profits from
Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 9.78m for the year ending January 31 1994.
A final dividend of 16p was proposed, bringing the total to 22p, an increase
of 63 per cent on last year's 13.5p.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 37.2p against 16.7p, restated from
18.1p to comply with FRS 3.
Turnover grew by 67 per cent, from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 18.5m, while funds
under management expanded from Pounds 2.39bn to Pounds 4.01bn.
The increased turnover included new fee income from the acquisition of
Target Trust Managers from the TSB, and the takeover by EFM Dragon of the
Drayton Asia investment trust.
A total of Pounds 590m of net new funds were received during the year,
including Pounds 48m from the launch of the EFM Small Companies Trust in
August.
Investment trusts continue to make the largest proportion of EFM's funds
under management, at Pounds 1.74m (43 per cent) against Pounds 1.05m (44 per
cent). Discretionary funds accounted for 31 per cent, unit trusts 16 per
cent, and private client funds 10 per cent.
'Investment trusts are traditionally a Scottish product and it is very
pleasing to see their continued return to favour, particularly among private
investors,' said Mr Ross. The group has launched two new investment trusts,
focusing on east Asia and Latin America, since the start of this year.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape ahead in 'tough year' - Motor
retailing improves on the back of a recovery in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape, the diversified group,
described 1993 as an 'exceptionally tough year' although normalised profits
were still ahead on 1992.
While group turnover rose by 16.7 per cent to Pounds 5.88bn, a fall in
margins left operating profits only 7.1 per cent higher at Pounds 279.6m,
including associates.
The pre-tax profit figure, on Inchcape's normalised basis, excluding
exceptional gains of Pounds 8.1m (loss Pounds 2.1m), but including property
profits of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 3.2m), rose 4.4 per cent from Pounds 252.2m
to Pounds 263.3m.
However, the small change in the group figure hid large swings between
divisions. For the first time, the group split out the operating profits
from motor retailing, which showed a jump from Pounds 43.6m to Pounds 71.4m,
on sales 10.2 per cent higher at Pounds 2.11bn.
This largely reflected the recovery in the UK retail market, although car
sales are still well below their late 1980s peak.
Importing and distribution, the other part of the motors business, suffered
from the strong yen, which squeezed margins and caused volumes to fall, and
declining markets in continental Europe. Operating profits fell 12.7 per
cent to Pounds 106.1m, including associates, in spite of a 31 per cent rise
in sales to Pounds 2.59bn.
Inchcape largely distributes cars from east Asia, notably from Toyota.
Although market shares were increased this was at the expense of margins, as
additional advertising and promotion costs were borne.
Results from the marketing division, which manages brands such as Colgate in
the Middle East and Heineken in Hong Kong, were disappointing, Mr Mackay
said. Profits, including associates, fell by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 58.2m
although sales were 20.5 per cent up at Pounds 1.29bn. Inchcape was hit by
the recession in Japan, which limited consumer spending, and austerity
measures in China.
The services division, which includes insurance, testing, shipping and
buying, increased profits by 27.4 per cent to Pounds 53.9m, with three of
the four sharply higher. Buying made a Pounds 1.2m loss (Pounds 3.4m profit)
as retail demand remained weak.
Interest charges rose Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 27.2m. Mr Rod O'Donoghue,
finance director, said the underlying increase was about Pounds 4m, although
gearing fell from 31 to 23 per cent. Net debt fell Pounds 24m to Pounds
205m, with the cash inflow before financing at Pounds 21.1m. This was after
capital expenditure of Pounds 33.9m and acquisitions of Pounds 103.4m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Blagden tumbles Pounds 10.6m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blagden Industries, the steel drum maker which has been badly hit by
recession in continental Europe, is planning a Pounds 20m rights issue and
is passing its final dividend after dropping to a Pounds 10.61m loss in 1993
. The shares fell 26p to 127p on the news.
The pre-tax loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 7.63m, was after
Pounds 13.3m of exceptional items and interest of Pounds 3.23m (Pounds
3.27m).
Mr Lance Levine, finance director, blamed the group's problems largely on
the situation in the German drum market which he said was 'becoming
lunatic'.
'No-one in our business in Germany is making money. The industry is being
run by people who have never known bad times.' He added that the problems
were exacerbated by public sector support for some of Blagden's struggling
competitors which in Britain would be insolvent. 'It is not a level playing
field,' he declared.
Blagden, 80 per cent of whose drum sales are on the Continent, is relatively
small in Germany. But German exports have flooded into its main markets in
France and Belgium.
Drum sales outside the UK fell to Pounds 118m (Pounds 123m) despite a boost
from the lower pound, and profits to Pounds 4.08m (Pounds 7.23m).
Group operating profits dropped from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 5.88m on sales
of Pounds 225.5m (Pounds 229.8m).
The provisions pushed gearing to an 'undesirably high' 82 per cent and the
group is planning a rights issue to raise at least Pounds 20m before the end
of May.
Mr Levine said negotiations with its lead banker, National Westminster, were
progressing well and that the delay was because of the recent arrival of new
chief executive Mr Richard Searle. 'He needs some more time to decide just
where we should be going.'
Mr Searle joined the group earlier this month, replacing Mr Cameron Smith
who left 'after amicable discussions'.
The exceptional items included a Pounds 3.8m provision for loss on disposal
of its French and Belgian packaging operations, Pounds 831,000 for the
closure of the Paisley drum operation, Pounds 2.33m for redundancies, in the
UK, Spain and France and a further Pounds 6.85m for unspecified site
rationalisation costs.
No final dividend leaves a 1.5p interim for 1993, against the previous
year's 9.5p total.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Proteus calls on shareholders for Pounds
10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proteus International, the biotechnology company, is making another call on
shareholders with a 1-for-7 rights issue to raise about Pounds 10.4m after
expenses.
Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said the cash would be used to pay for
research and development over the next two years by which time the company's
revenue stream might have risen enough to cover expenses.
The cash-raising operation comes less than two months after UBS resigned as
joint broker to the company following disagreements over the speed with
which its products could reach the market.
The new ordinary shares are expected to be issued at 284p and dealings in
the nil paid shares are expected to start today, with the latest time for
payment April 20. The shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 290p.
The rights issue will dilute the holding of Imseco, a private company, from
49.5 per cent to 43 per cent. Imseco is controlled by Mr Gilmore and Mr John
Poole, Proteus' managing director.
The issue is being underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities, broker to
the Cheshire-based company.
Proteus raised about Pounds 12m via a cash call in May 1992, two years after
it was floated on the USM at 87p a share.
For the six months to September 30 pre-tax losses at Proteus doubled to
Pounds 2.73m. The company specialises in using powerful computers to design
drugs.
COMMENT
The good news is that Proteus has a long pipeline of products in
development, the first of which should generate some revenue this year. The
rights issue is no sign of weakness: such companies need regular infusions
of capital to keep going until drugs are marketed. The bad news is that
there are serious question marks over whether the rights issue is worth
taking up. Proteus still has not found a big name stockbroker to represent
it after the resignation last month of UBS. Nor has it managed to sign
collaborative agreements with big research-driven drugs companies which have
the expertise and cash to buy into the best of the biotech sector. The
rights issue is, at best, speculative.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Forth Ports suffers 11.8% decline to Pounds
9.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forth Ports, the Scottish ports operator which was privatised just before
the 1992 General Election, saw an 11.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 9.6m in the year to December 31 1993.
Turnover rose from Pounds 32.4m to Pounds 33.1m and operating profit
increased by 2 per cent to 10.2m.
However, the pre-tax figure did not enjoy the Pounds 1.2m boost it received
in 1992 from a gain on early repayment of government loans.
The company warned when it presented its interim results last September that
the second half would suffer from a reduction in business from British
Steel's pipe coating business at Leith. But in the event other port business
held up well, said Mr William Thomson, chairman, and the company gained from
the unexpected import of large numbers of Ford Mondeo cars.
Mr Thomson said there had been an encouraging start to 1994, and Forth Ports
was benefiting from a new long-term agreement with BP on piped cargo from
the Hound Point terminal, as well as a new 15-year towage contract with
Shell for the Braefoot terminal. There was increased container traffic at
Grangemouth.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 1.7m at the year end, and
gearing dropped from 18 per cent to 4 per cent.
During 1993 Forth Ports' joint venture company, Victoria Quay, reached
agreement with the Environment Department's Property Holdings to develop a
350,000 sq ft office block for the Scottish Office in Leith.
The building has been sold forward for Pounds 47.5m and Forth Ports expects
to take the profit from the sale in 1994 and 1995.
The company says related property developments are already going ahead as a
consequence of the Victoria Quay deal, and expects a 'significant
contribution' from Victoria Quay in 1994.
Earnings per share were 21.4p (23.8p), or a rise of 22 per cent on 1992's
figure of 17.5p, reached after adjusting for the full year's pro forma
interest charge and excluding the gain on early repayment of government
loans.
The shares, which were floated at 110p and reached a high for 1993/94 of
508p, fell 16p yesterday to 489p. A final dividend of 5p is proposed, making
7.25p (6.25p) for the year.
Analysts yesterday forecast pre-tax profits for 1994 of between Pounds
12.25m and Pounds 12.5m.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Land buys Pounds 128m portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land yesterday announced a Pounds 128m acquisition of a property
portfolio from Royal Insurance, a composite insurer.
The properties will be transferred to the BL Quantum Property Fund, the
joint venture that British Land set up with Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund
last summer. It will bring the total investment of the fund up to about
Pounds 400m.
The portfolio, known as Sterling Estates, consists of 167 properties,
predominately in the retail sector, spread throughout the UK. The rental
income from the portfolio, which amounts to 1.8m sq ft, is about Pounds
10.8m a year.
British Land said it believed it could extract additional value from the
portfolio, which was better suited to the management-intensive style of a
property company than an investment institution.
'The portfolio will be beneficial because of its strong freehold and retail
content, its Scottish weight and its diversity of management opportunity,
including the possibility of trading,' it said.
Royal Insurance said the portfolio, which it had owned since the 1970s, was
put up for sale last October because the illiquidity of commercial property
made it inappropriate for a general insurance fund. The money will be
reinvested in equities. The company's remaining Pounds 140m of commercial
property is held for its own occupation.
The Sterling Estates portfolio is 92 per cent freehold. Over 60 per cent of
the properties are in the retail sector; it also includes offices,
industrial property and warehousing. More than half of the properties are in
the south of England, 10 per cent are in Scotland with the remainder in the
Midlands, the north and Wales.
The payment will be Pounds 120m in cash and 2m shares in British Land. The
company has the option either to procure delivery of the shares to the
vendor or to allot new shares. Completion of the deal is expected to take
place on April 25.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Roxboro beats flotation forecast with rise
to Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roxboro, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic and
electrical products, yesterday reported 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.4m,
comfortably ahead of the Pounds 5.7m forecast when the group came to market
in November.
The pre-tax figure represented a 66 per cent increase over the Pounds 3.9m
recorded in 1992. Turnover from continuing operations increased by 28 per
cent to Pounds 41.9m with exchange rate movements contributing Pounds 3m.
Export sales, mostly to original equipment manufacturers, grew by over 60
per cent and now account for 25 per cent of total sales.
After plant closure costs of Pounds 500,000, offset by a Pounds 450,000
release from other provisions, operating profits worked through at Pounds
6.63m (Pounds 3.64m), including Pounds 445,000 (Pounds 65,000) from
discontinued operations.
BLP Components, the electromagnetic product business, boosted operating
profits from Pounds 273,000 to Pounds 1.27m, on sales Pounds 2m ahead at
Pounds 16.7m. The growth in the main came from export markets where sales
increased by 47 per cent to Pounds 6.3m.
Dialight, the US-based electro-optical business, raised operating profits
from Dollars 6.8m to Dollars 9.8m (Pounds 6.7m) on sales which grew by 19
per cent led by continued growth in the Local Area Network market.
The group ended the year with a Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.8m) order book which
Mr Harry Tee, chief executive, said had increased further to Pounds 10.8m at
the end of February.
As a result of the flotation the balance sheet was considerably strengthened
and the group ened the year with net cash balances of Pounds 4.7m after
capital expenditure last year of Pounds 1.9m.
Earnings per share amounted to 14.3p (13.2p). As forecast, there is no
divi-dend.
The shares, which were issued at 230p, closed 15p higher at 248p.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon crisis service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, is to link up with three other
international organisations to form Global Liability Management, a company
which will sell risk control and crisis management services to multinational
businesses.
Other participants in Global Liability Management include Rowland Worldwide,
a communications company which is a subsidiary of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Company; Acer Consultants, a UK company specialising in industrial and
infrastructural engineering and environmental policy analysis; and Popham,
Haik, Schnobrich and Kaufman, a leading firm of US lawyers on environmental
and product liability litigation.
Mr Rodney Meere, chairman of Willis Corroon Hinton risk management
subsidiary, and a GLM board member, said the new company would provide a
'single source of liability advice and management' on a worldwide basis.
The development reflected the 'trend to bring under one management such
functions as insurance, corporate security, public relations, law and
environmental engineering,' said Mr G Marc Whitehead, chairman of GLM and of
Popham, Haik. GLM's board includes three representatives from each member
company. It will be incorporated in Belgium and have offices in London, Hong
Kong and New York.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Italian acquisition helps Sherwood advance
to Pounds 18.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from the Italian bra maker acquired last April helped
Sherwood Group, the Nottingham-based lace, lingerie and socks maker, to lift
1993 profits by 9 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 18.5m - just above the
figure given 10 days ago in a profits warning. The shares, which fell 19p to
151p after the warning, closed yesterday at 132p, up 2p.
Lepel, the Italian acquisition, contributed Pounds 3.4m to profits and
Pounds 10.4m to total turnover of Pounds 153m (Pounds 144m). Margins at
Lepel were 32.9 per cent. Mr David Parker, executive chairman, said the
Italian company had lived up to Sherwood's high expectations.
Garment sales, including sales from Lepel, totalled Pounds 74.2m, up from
Pounds 66.1m. Operating margins were 16.1 per cent, against 13.2 per cent.
However, the increased profitability in lingerie was offset by a decrease in
socks, which were hit by imports to the UK.
Turnover in lace increased from Pounds 78.4m to Pounds 80m, or 52 per cent
of total sales. Of this, half was sold in continental Europe. Operating
profits of the group's European lace makers fell from Pounds 4.68m to Pounds
1.58m on unchanged turnover of Pounds 49.5m, reflecting the devaluation late
in 1992 of sterling, the lira and the peseta.
The group is restructuring its Dentex lace operations in Germany and the
Netherlands, streamlining the sales mechanisms and cutting the number of
sites. In addition, the group management is being restructured, with a lace
operational board and garments operational board reporting to the main
board.
Mr Parker is quitting his dual role as chairman and managing director to
become executive chairman. Mr Jim Telfer, who has been in charge of Birkin,
the UK lace maker, has been appointed group managing director. Mr Ben
Martin, recently retired as a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has been
appointed as second non-executive director.
Earnings per share edged ahead to 10.7p (10.6p) and the board is proposing a
final dividend of 1.9p (1.7p) taking the total for the year to 2.9p (2.6p).
COMMENT
If profits for the current year come in at about Pounds 21m, the shares look
cheap with a prospective multiple of 11. The balance sheet is strong, with
interest cover just over eight times. But the group blew a small hole in its
credibility by issuing a warning so soon before the results. It now has to
show that the impressive margins at Lepel are sustainable; that the new
management structures for the group and Dentex are working; and that it can
fight back in the sock market. If recovery comes, the shares could be seen
as a bargain. But there remains the risk of something else going wrong and
not being picked up until late.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged MY 24% higher at Pounds 1.13m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY Holdings, the enlarged specialist packaging group, returned pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.13m for the half year ended February 26, an improvement
of 24 per cent over last time's Pounds 911,000.
Turnover rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 19.1m with recent acquisitions,
Kohler Packaging and Doncaster Packaging, contributing Pounds 818,000 to
turnover and Pounds 89,000 to operating profits.
Last month, MY expanded further via the Pounds 21.3m purchase of Insight
Cartons, a provider of printed folding cartons primarily for the food
industry. Consideration was funded by a placing and open offer which raised
Pounds 23m.
MY's majority shareholder, Malbak, took up only part of its rights under the
open offer. That reduced its shareholding in the group from 85.7 per cent to
65 per cent and allowed MY to return to the main market.
Mr John Grainger, chairman, said the half year results were scored against a
backdrop of 'muted demand and fierce competition'.
He added that the board remained 'concerned' in the short term over the
weakness of the UK economy.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.77p (1.48p) and, as forecast, the interim
dividend is being doubled to 0.5p.
The board expects to maintain the final payment at last year's level of 1p.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Automated Security falls to Pounds 11.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automated Security (Holdings), the international electronic security systems
company, turned in sharply lower full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.8m
for the year to November 30, mainly reflecting the absence of a Pounds 30.3m
profit on the sale of discontinued business the previous year.
The group caused a furore last autumn when it went ahead with an enhanced
scrip dividend in lieu of its 3.05p interim despite a sharp fall in its
share price triggered by an earlier profits warning. It is now proposing an
ordinary scrip issue in lieu of the final dividend.
Under the terms of the scheme, shareholders are being offered one share for
every 48 held in lieu of a 2.25p final. The shares closed up 1p at 109p.
The pre-tax result compares with restated pre-tax profits of Pounds 45.1m
which included the profit on the sale of the group's European security and
specialist CCTV business. Earnings per share fell to 2.4p (25.8p.)
Ash said pre-tax profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds
18.1m (Pounds 9.6m.) Turnover from continuing operations increased by 20 per
cent to Pounds 153.5m (Pounds 127.3m), including Pounds 10.1m from
acquisitions.
Total group turnover slipped to Pounds 160.8m (Pounds 173.2m), including
Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 45.9m) from discontinued operations.
The group said it experienced 'difficult trading conditions in the UK during
the first nine months,' but noted that market recovery was reflected in a 23
per cent increase in fourth quarter operating profits to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds
5.7m) on revenues which grew by 14 per cent to Pounds 44.1m (Pounds 38.7m.)
Overall full-year operating profits fell by almost 28 per cent to Pounds
19.4m (Pounds 26.9m) including Pounds 706,000 attributed to acquisitions but
after a Pounds 4.97m loss (Pounds 5.35m profit) from discontinued
operations.
The UK operations lifted their contribution to operating profits by 7.5 per
cent to Pounds 21m on revenues up 12.3 per cent to Pounds 110m spurred by
the success of the group's new verification products and the acquisition of
Telecom Security.
During the year the group completed its restructuring with the consolidation
of its two main operating companies in the UK. This led to restructuring and
reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.38m, down from Pounds 3.73m in 1992.
In the US operating profits increased by 34.6 per cent to Pounds 7.6m on
revenues which grew by 48.3 per cent to Pounds 43.5m, helped by a strong
performance by Sonitrol.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higher cigarette taxes peg T&amp;S rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased taxes on cigarettes held back the advance at T&amp;S Stores, the
newsagent and convenience store retailer, which yesterday announced a
marginal increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.53m to Pounds 12.56m for
the year to January 1.
The increase was achieved on a 2 per cent advance in sales to Pounds 352m.
Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, was bullish about the current year, saying
like-for-like sales were running 7 per cent ahead of last year.
Further improvement would come from the Pounds 5.95m cash acquisition
announced yesterday of 27 convenience stores trading under the Macs name.
This is T&amp;S's second acquisition this year, after the Pounds 6.7m cash
purchase of 74 Gibbs newsagents shops.
The two purchases are expected to contribute sales of more than Pounds 40m
in the current year.
Supercigs, the discount tobacco and confectionery chain, suffered an 11 per
cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 2.54m, on sales 3 per cent lower
at Pounds 170.6m.
Mr Threlfall said a shift in focus towards discounting a wider range of
products at the Supercigs chain, including magazines and cards, had helped
to offset the effects of an overall decline in the cigarette market.
Dillons newsagents reported a 4 per cent advance at the operating level to
Pounds 5.8m, on sales 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 102.8m. Mr Threlfall said
the increase was due to tight cost controls, with the average branch profit
up by 9 per cent to Pounds 21,740.
Dillons convenience stores increased operating profits by 8 per cent to
Pounds 4.39m on sales 16 per cent ahead at Pounds 78.7m. Like-for-like sales
were 5 per cent ahead, in spite of increased Sunday opening from
supermarkets.
Mr Threlfall said T&amp;S intended to open 30 new stores across the businesses
this year.
The final dividend was increased by 3 per cent to 3.6p, for a total pay-out
of 6.1p (5.9p). Earnings per share fell from 15.17p to 13.44p.
COMMENT
These were disappointing results, but the market was half expecting to be
disappointed. The best news was the latest acquisition which, added to that
in January, gives hope that T&amp;S may end two years of stagnation in 1994.
Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.8m this year. After the 9p
rise to 194p in the shares, the forward multiple of 13 times may not look
too demanding.

RJB Mining said it would consider making bids for each of the five regions

10 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.2m.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said his company would look at all the
regions, although it was impossible to say whether it would bid for all of
them until it saw what was being offered and the terms attached to the
packages.
The government is expected to outline the packages within the next few
months. RJB is one of the frontrunners among UK companies and analysts
believe it is likely to bid for a majority and possibly all five of the
regions.
RJB is already leasing two former British Coal mines, Clipstone, in
Nottinghamshire, and Rossington in Yorkshire, and may secure terms for
another one or two.
Mr Budge said the company would also consider bids for three other pits
closed by British Coal, which are to be offered for sale to the private
sector alongside the five main packages.
In the year to December 31, RJB increased sales to Pounds 74.76m (Pounds
73.85m). It is recommending a final dividend of 7p to take the total for the
year to 12p, covered 1.9 times by earnings per share of 22.7p.
Mr Budge said the company was in a strong position to grow regardless of
whether it was successful in its bids for British Coal regions.
The two mines already leased from British Coal were premium pits and the
rest of the business, which is mostly opencast mining, was going in line
with, or better than, the company predicted when it was floated on the
market last year.
COMMENT
These are heady days for private sector coal mining as it prepares to take
over an industry which it believes has enormous potential for making money
as soon as the state loosens its grip on it at privatisation. In common with
companies like Coal Investments and NSM, RJB has enjoyed a significant
re-evaluation of its shares in recent months. After yesterday's 8p rise to
378p, RJB's shares are trading on a prospective p/e ratio of 17, assuming it
makes Pounds 14.5m this year. Such a rating may seem high, especially for a
company whose gearing would need to rise to about 60 per cent from its
current 30 per cent to fund a third leased mine. However, the gearing will
fall again next year as the company feels the full benefits of recent
acquisitions and leasing deals. The real question for the company is how far
it should go in buying the rest of British Coal in a falling and uncertain
market. Its growth strategy is not without risks and RJB holds out the
promise of much more than it has so far achieved. Nonetheless, it has yet to
put a foot wrong since its flotation and it is as well equipped as any UK
company to make a go of the industry's privatisation.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GKN steps up its pursuit of Westland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday stepped up its
pursuit of Westland after the helicopter manufacturer admitted its operating
profits would decline this year.
The Yeovil-based company, which is fighting GKN's Pounds 497m bid, said
profits from its underlying business would fall from Pounds 35.5m last year
to Pounds 35m.
Pre-tax profits, however, are expected to increase by 64 per cent to Pounds
50m following a Pounds 15m gain arising out of an initial compensation
payment from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, which is at the
centre of a Pounds 385m damages claim filed by Westland.
A further Pounds 3.4m profit on a property disposal is expected to be offset
by interest payments.
Although Westland promised shareholders a 6 per cent dividend increase to
4.75p and a 5p special interim dividend next year to reflect the AOI
payment, GKN said the profits forecast was disappointing.
Sir David Lees, who has offered Westland shareholders 290p per ordinary
share, said: 'I thought there would be something more. Westland has been
predicting only good news, but operating profits are forecast to fall.'
Nevertheless, shares in the helicopter group, in which GKN already has a 45
per cent stake, rose 7 1/2 p yesterday to close at 325p.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, said GKN's offer undervalued the company
and its prospects for future orders, especially for its flagship EH101
helicopter.
He also highlighted potential demand for the Apache helicopter, developed in
partnership with McDonnell Douglas, which the group hopes the British Army
will order next year.
Citing estimates of steadily increasing orders, Mr Jones said: 'An order for
Apache would transform these growth prospects, providing the profit
potential on an estimated Pounds 2bn of sales.'
GKN again accused him of inflating order prospects and pointed out that
similar hopes for the Black Hawk helicopter had failed to materialise.
Sir David said he would be seeking a meeting with Mr Jones later this week
at which he would underline his determination to take control of the group
and merge it into GKN's existing defence business.
The engineering group has until the end of the week to make a revised offer,
but Mr Jones - who predicted Sir David would come up with a 'parsimonious'
offer - hinted that some senior Westland managers would step down if GKN won
control.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rising Asian demand lifts Scholl to Pounds
16.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a downturn in some of its core European markets, Scholl, the
healthcare products group, increased pre-tax profits by 3.8 per cent in
1993.
Rising demand in Asia and growth in its licensing and distribution business
underpinned an advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 16.1m) in
the year to December 31.
Together with contributions from new acquisitions, increased sales in
south-east Asia helped to offset flat or falling European turnover,
especially in Italy where sales declined by Pounds 4m to Pounds 20.5m.
Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said new subsidiaries - dominated by Elf
Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical group acquired for Pounds 16.8m in June
last year - pushed group turnover ahead by 13.6 per cent to Pounds 171.9m.
They also offset a decline in profits on continuing operations with an
Pounds 869,000 contribution - lifting total operating profits to Pounds 16m
(Pounds 15.2m).
Mr Franchino blamed the flat performance of its underlying business on the
loss of its Coppertone licence in Italy, tighter operating margins on its
retail business and increased marketing costs.
The group was however, well placed to expand its core healthcare business.
Earnings per share rose to 12.7p (12.1p) and the final dividend is increased
to 3.8p (3.7p), making 6.4p (6.3p) for the year.
COMMENT
Scholl has seen fatigue set into its traditional markets, none more so than
in the UK where sales of its famous shoes have declined sharply. But it has
acted fast to counter the problems by bringing new management into the
retail business, while also distributing and licensing new products at home
and overseas. That has paid off dramatically in Asia, which the group
expects to be the group's largest profit centre by 1995. Further gains in
the region have persuaded analysts to upgrade profit forecasts this year to
Pounds 18.1m on a forward multiple of 13. With European markets unlikely to
decline further and growth seemingly assured elsewhere, that makes the
shares an attractive option.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 73% rise at Bemrose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bemrose Corporation, the Derby-based security and promotional printer which
is now the largest supplier to the US advertising specialty market following
a series of acquisitions, yesterday reported sharply higher 1993 pre-tax
profits.
Pre-tax profits rose by 73 per cent from Pounds 6.26m to Pounds 10.8m and
included a Pounds 579,000 profit on the sale of a subsidiary. Turnover grew
to Pounds 89m (Pounds 49.3m) including Pounds 40m from acquisitions.
Earnings per share, including the profit on disposal, grew to 30.47p
(22.18p). An unchanged final dividend of 7.45p makes a total of 11.75p
(same) on increased capital. The shares closed 1p higher at 453p.
Operating profits jumped to Pounds 11.87m (Pounds 5.48m) with all of the
increase coming from acquisitions. Mr Rodger Booth, chief executive, said
that in the UK, earnings and operating profits were maintained despite
margins coming under pressure.
The continued downturn in UK bank cheque printing was offset by gains in
other security products. Sales of promotional products were a little higher,
but margins tightened. Nevertheless, all the group's businesses in the
promotional sector performed close to 1992 levels, including Barnard and
Jackson, the diary manufacturer acquired in April.
In the US - the focus for the group's recent expansion which has been funded
through two rights issues - operating profits increased, with additional
gains generated by the strengthening dollar.
The US businesses, including Bemrose Yattendon, previously a 50:50 joint
venture company, contributed Pounds 4.65m to operating profits.
COMMENT
1993 was a transition year for Bemrose which has successfully built a new US
leg to its operations. With margins under pressure in the UK and the
traditional cheque printing business in decline, the US businesses should
help maintain profit and earnings growth this year. Profits of around Pounds
11.8m are likely this year, producing earnings of about 28.4p. The shares
are trading on a prospective p/e of 16 and the price looks about right.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Royal Doulton pleases City with upbeat
sales outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Doulton shares rose 19p yesterday to 253p as the fine china
manufacturer made its first profits announcement as an independently quoted
company and revealed that sales were running at their highest levels for
four years.
This leaves the shares some 31 per cent higher than the initial quote price
of 193p following the demerger in December from media conglomerate Pearson,
which owns the Financial Times.
Mr Stuart Lyons, chief executive, said the order book for the current year
was 'satisfactory' after better than expected trading in December. The UK
was showing particularly good growth, with an encouraging increase in the
premium brands.
A series of one-off costs as a result of the demerger forced Royal Doulton's
1993 pre-tax profits down from Pounds 3.89m to Pounds 3.04m for the year to
December 31. The costs included a Pounds 1.9m loss on the sale of a stake in
the Canadian newspaper group, The Financial Post, and a Pearson management
charge of Pounds 2.35m. Further demerger costs came to Pounds 851,000.
Pearson was also paid a special net dividend of Pounds 18.2m, which left
Royal Doulton with a Pounds 5.7m advance corporation charge to be offset
against tax on future UK profits.
Mr Mark Burrell, non-executive chairman, said the underlying performance had
been good. Cost cutting and tight control of working capital had helped
operating profits to increase from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 11.6m on sales
10.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 222m.
The sales increase had benefited from currency gains. At constant exchange
rates, however, sales were still more than 5 per cent ahead.
The company incurred losses in the Canadian retail business, continental
Europe and a Japanese joint venture. However, steps had been taken to repair
the losses and Royal Doulton was confident the Japanese division would
return to profitability as the economy recovered. The group is to buy the
outstanding joint venture stake in August for up to Pounds 5m.
Royal Doulton announced a stronger than expected balance sheet, with net
debt of Pounds 18.1m, including the ACT charge. This reflected strong cash
generation and a Pounds 9m reduction in stocks to Pounds 79.2m. Gearing was
17 per cent against a pro forma 69 per cent.
A single dividend of 3p is proposed. Losses emerged at 5p (earnings 14.2p),
reflecting the demerger and non-recurring costs. After adjustment, earnings
advanced from 9.2p to 10.6p.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pearson to set up multimedia arm -
Ex-Virgin Games chief expected to join group to create new division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media and publishing group, is setting up a multimedia division
to co-ordinate its activities in the new business area where print and
visual images increasingly converge.
The company, it is believed, has hired Mr Nick Alexander - who used to run
Virgin Games - to create the new division.
Mr Alexander, who at present runs Sega Europe, the European arm of the
international interactive games group, has either already resigned from Sega
or is about to do so, to join Pearson. Pearson declined to comment.
The move is a symptom of the increasing interest in the visual media at
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, following the decision to concentrate
on information, education and entertainment.
The growing interest in multimedia would involve Pearson's existing
operations in educational publishing but the new division, it is believed,
would be a focus for acquisitions in the area.
At the same time both of Pearson's two main television interests, the 17.5
per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting and the 100 per cent ownership of
Thames Television, both appear to be holding out prospects of substantial
growth.
In the 1993 results, which came in yesterday at Pounds 209m at the pre-tax
level, returns from both are modest.
Thames, which cost a total of Pounds 100.7m in June 1993, contributed Pounds
6.5m in operating profits and BSkyB put in Pounds 6.9m - the first time that
income from the satellite television venture has come through.
In both cases, however, that seems to be only the beginning of the story.
Thames may soon be valued at considerably more than its Pounds 100m purchase
price.
Apart from continuing orders from the ITV network for its programmes, such
as The Bill, Pearson's 10 per cent stake through Thames in the Astra
television satellite system may be about to be revalued.
The Deutsche Bundespost is negotiating for a stake in the satellite systems,
and valuations are believed to be about Pounds 50m for a 10 per cent
holding.
A contribution in the region of Pounds 35m is expected from BSkyB in this
current year. A total of 3.3m homes are subscribing to at least one BSkyB
service, and there is a total of 7m channel subscriptions, showing that a
large proportion of BSkyB viewers are paying for several of the channel
packages on offer.
Lord Blakenham, Pearson chairman, said: 'In June we took the decision to
concentrate our resources on our media and entertainment businesses, and by
December Camco and Royal Doulton had become independent public companies.'
He continued: 'As a media company we have great opportunities for deploying
our brands and copyrights in a variety of expanding and overlapping media
markets.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson expands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Nelson AGB, the largest market research group in the UK, is boosting
the 1993 dividend by 50 per cent from 0.3p to 0.45p after lifting pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.17m for the year, writes David Blackwell.
This compares with a previous Pounds 994,000, restated for FRS 3. At the
operating level profits were up at Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 4.15m).
Turnover improved by 18 per cent from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds 55.7m. UK
turnover improved to Pounds 53m, representing 20 per cent of the total UK
market, which grew by 8 per cent in the year.
Earnings per share rose from 0.38p to 1.26p while directors are proposing a
final dividend of 0.32p compared with 0.2p.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said that continuous contract business
represented about 50 per cent of group turnover. The other half was made up
of ad hoc business, which had grown by 11 per cent in the year.
The consumer sector, which makes up most of the group's business with
turnover of Pounds 30.2m, had a mixed year as clients cut their budgets.
However, retailers had started to spend more on research, and this in turn
had attracted business from City analysts.
Orders for ad hoc research in the healthcare sector, with a total turnover
of Pounds 8.7m, were up by 35 per cent as domestic pressures forced UK and
US pharmaceutical companies to address wider markets.
The business services sector also improved, but the media and television
research markets suffered from the concentration of ownership.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave SBJ Pounds 0.5m in the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, yesterday reported a swing from
profits of Pounds 13.27m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 521,000 for 1993.
A reduced final dividend of 6p cuts the total from 13.25p to 9p.
The deficit was fully in line with expectations following the announcement
of exceptional costs at the interim stage last September. Dealers responded
positively to an underlying trading profit of Pounds 6.92m and marked the
shares up 10p to 129p.
A poor performance by the group's direct energy and marine reinsurance
operations was the main factor in a decline in brokerage income to Pounds
45.3m (Pounds 47.3m). Although hull, cargo and protection and indemnity
business performed well energy brokers struggled with tight capacity in
London and tough competition in the US.
Income from marine insurance and reinsurance as a whole fell to Pounds 11.1m
(Pounds 14.7m). By contrast, brokerage income from London market non-marine
increased to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 14.6m), while retail business rose to
Pounds 19.95m (Pounds 16.7m).
Income was also hit by an exchange rate loss of Pounds 2.24m.
Investment and other income fell to Pounds 6.02m (Pounds 7.83m). The share
of profits of associates amounted to Pounds 19,000 (Pounds 911,000).
Administrative expenses increased to Pounds 44.4m (Pounds 43.9m) and charges
for reorganisation and closure amounted to Pounds 4.4m.
COMMENT
The bad news which has led the shares to underperform in the last 12 months
appears to be over. There was no further deterioration in the second half
and tough management action last year should now begin to yield fruit.
Planned cuts in expenses should produce savings of some Pounds 3m this year
and the group should also benefit significantly from the strength of the
dollar. New pay incentives have been introduced for senior staff, but
trading conditions remain difficult and earnings prospects uncertain. Even
so, on balance and barring any further mishaps, 1994 profits of at least
Pounds 8m should be within reach, putting the share on an attractive
multiple going forward of under 12. A prospective yield of 8.7 provides
support.

FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Latin performance boosts Nelson Hurst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance in south-east Asia and Latin America helped Nelson
Hurst, the insurance broker listed late last year, lift 1993 pre-tax profits
from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 5.31m.
Earnings per share rose from 3.4p to 16.6p.
Mr David Woodward, chairman, said the results exceeded forecasts contained
in the listing particulars. Brokerage revenues increased by 17 per cent to
Pounds 36.7m, with revenues from the Middle East and south-east Asia up by
43 per cent to Pounds 5.9m. Brokerage from its Latin American network also
increased, by nearly 40 per cent.
The increase also reflected the appreciation of the US dollar, a currency in
which Nelson Hurst obtains 40 per cent of its revenues. Dollar income was
booked at an average exchange rate of Dollars 1.50 compared with an average
of Dollars 1.75 in 1992. On an underlying basis, revenues were up by 11 per
cent.
Other operating income rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 3.1m, despite a 19 per
cent drop in investment income because of lower dollar and sterling interest
rates. The increase reflected a foreign exchange gain of Pounds 300,000
(Pounds 1m loss).
Expenses were 6 per cent higher at Pounds 32.7m. The expense ratio fell by
10 points to 88 per cent. The company's first dividend as a public company
will be this year's interim, payable in October.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Pearson up 38% following focus on media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the publishing and information group, yesterday marked its
transformation from conglomerate to media group with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 208.6m for 1993, a rise of 38 per cent.
Although the comparison is with a poor 1992, when profits fell 16 per cent
to Pounds 151m, all the main Pearson businesses showed increases in
operating profits.
The figures also included a Pounds 20m write-down on the headquarters of the
Financial Times, bought for Pounds 74m at the height of the property boom.
Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, warned yesterday that although 1994 had
started strongly, it was 'a year of transition'. The group would not have
the benefit of the profits from the demerged Royal Doulton china group and
would have more modest dividends from Camco, the oil services company, after
the sale of a majority stake.
He emphasised that, while continuing to build on the written word, the
company would continue to put more money into screen-based businesses.
The pre-tax profits of Pounds 208.6m were earned on sales up 12 per cent,
from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.28bn. Earnings per share emerged at 27p
(19.3p) on an FRS3 basis, or 27.9p (17.3p) excluding exceptionals. The
recommended final dividend of 7.625p raises the total by 1p to 13p.
Pearson wrote back a Pounds 71.4m provision made in 1990 for its investment
in British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), the satellite television venture that
has now moved into operating profit. This was largely offset by a loss of
Pounds 66.2m on the sale of a 55 per cent stake in Camco.
Books performed well with a rise in operating profit from Pounds 80.4m to
Pounds 102m and newspapers rose from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 48m. The FT
Group, including Les Echos in France, increased pre-tax profits by 12.1 per
cent to Pounds 42.3m with the FT newspaper showing underlying growth of 14
per cent, although there was a small decline in operating profit to Pounds
12.2m because of Pounds 2.3m in redundancy payments.
Visitor attractions, such as theme parks, increased operating profit from
Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 15.8m and investment banking was up from Pounds 23.7m
to Pounds 36.4m.
The City reacted well to the results and the shares finished 31p up at 666p.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers Goldman Sachs, is
forecasting pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 247m, including Pounds 10m
from the 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB.

FT  29 MAR 94 / US funds bite the silver bullet: The speculative forces
driving up the metal's price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The silver market has long been a favourite playground for speculators. Now
the same big speculative US commodity funds that drove up the gold price
this time last year have joined in the fun.
The funds' objective, say some traders, is to push silver's spot price from
this year's low of Dollars 4.90 a troy ounce to Dollars 8. Their first
target is Dollars 6 an ounce, which they might achieve this week. 'If the
funds want to take the price to Dollars 6, Dollars 7 or Dollars 8, they can
take it there. They have the money,' says Mr George Milling-Stanley, an
analyst at Lehman Brothers.
US hedge funds are rumoured to have spent Dollars 1bn (Pounds 668m) to buy
physical silver which they have moved from the New York Commodity Exchange
(Comex) to vaults in Delaware to give the impression that Comex stocks are
falling because of heavy demand. Since October Comex silver stocks have
dropped by about 30m ounces, or about 11 per cent. Dealers suggest the funds
are willing to spend another Dollars 1bn. At present prices, Dollars 1bn
would buy about three quarters of the Comex stockpile.
For some traders this brings back memories of when speculators had tonnes of
the metal moved out of Comex stocks into trucks that simply drove up and
down New York streets until stocktaking was completed. Then the silver went
straight back to Comex.
The silver market was also the scene of the most audacious, and ultimately
disastrous, gamble by the Hunt family of Texas. In 1979 Mr Bunker Hunt,
whose family had built an oil fortune, and some Arab partners attempted to
corner the silver market by amassing nearly 200m ounces, about half the
world's deliverable silver - then worth Dollars 6.6bn. In less than a year,
silver rose from Dollars 6 an ounce to just over Dollars 50. But in early
1980 the price began to slide, the Hunts could not meet their margin calls
and had to be bailed out by their bankers. Their initial losses totalled
Dollars 1bn and eventually the catastrophe helped drive the Hunt businesses
into bankruptcy. The massive stocks of silver flushed out by the high prices
have loomed ominously over the market ever since.
'Bunker Hunt and others caused mayhem in the silver market that lasted for
years,' says Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. 'Silver
bullets have a history of backfiring and the consequences are often bloody.'
It has been said that the US funds were attracted to the silver market by
its volatility - it is possible to double the price in a year, something
that cannot be achieved with gold. 'But silver has also been known to halve
in price in a year,' says Mr Smith.
Mr Milling-Stanley points out that, whereas the funds' attack on the gold
price came when there was record demand for the physical metal, this is not
the case with silver. 'I talk to consumers every day and they are not buying
more silver.'
Most silver is used for photographic or X-ray film and demand has held up
reasonably well during the recession, helped by cheap disposable cameras
that need more silver in the film. Industrial demand for silver remained
stable at about 13,000 tonnes last year, according to the CRU International
research organisation.
Nevertheless, CRU estimates that demand outpaced supply by 1,771 tonnes last
year, helped by an upsurge in imports to India. Following some easing of
import restrictions, India imported 2,800 tonnes of silver in 1993 compared
with 800 tonnes the previous year.
Mr Tony Warwick-Ching of CRU suggests the long-term outlook for silver has
improved. But he estimates there is still 10,000-15,000 tonnes of silver in
stocks worldwide, enough to satisfy demand for at least a year.
He pours cold water on the US funds' hopes that Indian demand will remain at
record levels even if prices rise. Demand from India dropped dramatically
when the silver price reached Dollars 5 an ounce recently. 'And India could
start selling again. India exported a great deal of silver when the price
boomed in the late 1970s.'
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group,
agrees. 'India has a long history of dishoarding precious metals,
particularly silver, when overseas prices are attractive.'
Mr Arnold is advising clients to 'stand aside for the time being and watch
and see just how high silver prices can be pushed by the funds and other
investors and speculators. The higher prices go, the more certain we can be
that there will be a massive supply response and prices will fall back.'
Dealers suggest that the US funds are using their financial muscle to drive
up the silver price, hoping this will attract the attention of ill-informed
private investors. Once there are enough of these on the bandwagon, the
funds can exit with their profits. One dealer says: 'The big fish are making
a lot of noise to attract in the tiddlers so that the big fish can then swim
off with their spoils.'
And after that? Mr Milling-Stanley says that when the funds take their
profits, he would not be surprised to see silver's price drop below Dollars
5 an ounce again.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Inchcape profits hit by yen strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape shares fell 37p to 515p yesterday after it reported 1993 profits
adversely affected by the yen's strength and weak demand in many markets.
Investors also took fright at remarks by Sir David Plastow, chairman,
suggesting 1994 would be another difficult year. Analysts reduced profit
forecasts.
Sir David said the weakness of economies in continental Europe and Japan, as
well as austerity measures in China, affected demand. Inchcape acts as a
distributor and retailer of cars, consumer goods and business products.
He said that on average the yen had risen 26 per cent during 1993 against
currencies that mattered to Inchcape.
Of 1994, Sir David said, 'most of the factors that made 1993 such a
challenging year still remain'. He said Inchcape did not expect a marked
recovery in the business climate, nor any significant improvement in the
currency position.
Mr Rod O'Donoghue, finance director, said the unexpected strength of the yen
cost the group Pounds 13m, as the beneficial translation effect was more
than offset by the impact on Inchcape's sales of Japanese cars.
Inchcape said that although Toyota, the main brand it sells, had increased
market share around the world, volumes had fallen in many areas. Operating
profits from motors rose 7 per cent to Pounds 177.5m thanks to retailing
strength.
Profits from marketing dropped 7 per cent to Pounds 58.2m. The group won
more agencies than it lost, but the ending of the Rolex and Nike franchises
had affected profits. Profits from services, such as insurance, shipping,
testing and buying, rose 27 per cent to Pounds 53.9m.
The group has yet to decide whether to exercise its option to buy Gestetner
convertibles which expires on July 1. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive,
said the cost of taking up the option would be Pounds 41m, which would pay
for itself from the interest on the convertibles. With a 14.6 per cent stake
already, Inchcape could end up with 23.6 per cent.
Profits before tax rose 8.5 per cent on an FRS3 basis to Pounds 271.4m, but
were 4.4 per cent higher on a 'normalised' profit of Pounds 263.3m,
excluding exceptional items but including property profits which rose from
Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 10.9m.
Earnings per share on an FRS3 basis rose 9.4 per cent to 33.9p while
normalised earnings were up 1.6 per cent to 32.1p. A final dividend of 9p
(8.35p) makes a total of 14.8p, up 7.6 per cent.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Volvo to ask shareholders to alter terms of bid for BCP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, yesterday faced more fallout from the
collapse of its merger with France's Renault. It was in the awkward position
of having to put to its shareholders terms for the full takeover of a
subsidiary company which it believes are too generous.
The dilemma concerns the consumer products group BCP, which Volvo last year
agreed to take over in a deal with the government on the break-up of
Procordia - jointly controlled by Volvo and the state. Procordia was split
into BCP and Pharmacia, a pharmaceuticals company still controlled by the
government.
Taking over BCP, a strongly profitable company, and holding a residual 25
per cent shareholding in Pharmacia were two key elements in a plan by former
Volvo chairman Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar to build a diversified Volvo following
the merger of its car and truck operations with Renault.
The new Volvo board is committed to the BCP and Pharmacia investments,
despite the collapse of the Renault deal. But it wants to change the terms
of its bid for the 26 per cent of BCP that it does not already hold because
a surge in Volvo's share price of more than SKr200 since the Renault merger
was scrapped has left it open to paying almost 50 per cent more than it
intended when it made the bid last October.
In the first of three alternatives, Volvo offered one new Volvo share for
six BCP shares, valuing BCP shares at SKr71 each. The same offer now values
BCP shares at SKr104 each, which one Volvo executive described as
'definitely too generous'. The original cash alternative was set as low as
SKr47 per BCP share.
These terms were never voted on by Volvo shareholders because they were to
have been put to the same emergency meeting planned to vote on the Renault
merger. That meeting never took place. But the Swedish Securities Council
has ruled that Volvo must present the original terms to its shareholders at
next month's annual meeting.
The new Volvo board will, therefore, be putting a proposal formulated by the
old board to their shareholders - and hoping it will be rejected so a new
bid for BCP can be formulated.
Volvo also announced a five-for-one share split yesterday.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Holliday pays Pounds 52m for Reckitt's Blue division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Holliday Chemical, the industrial dyes company which went public last year,
is buying one of Britain's oldest chemicals businesses from Reckitt &amp;
Colman, the consumer products group.
Holliday is paying Pounds 52m for Reckitt Colours International which has
been making synthetic ultramarine for use in clothes laundering since 1883.
Based in Hull, where Isaac Reckitt first started making washing blue in the
1850s, RCI now supplies mainly industrial markets, particularly for use in
colouring plastics.
Reckitt &amp; Colman said the disposal was in line with its strategy of
concentrating on consumer goods. Most of RCI's 'laundry grade' product goes
to a separate Reckitt division which will continue to sell laundry blue
under the Reckitt's Blue and Robin Blue brands.
The latter is a leading brand in India. Demand has dried up in the developed
world because of the introduction of other whiteners in washing powders.
Holliday is funding the acquisition largely by a one-for-four rights issue
at 180p, raising a net Pounds 36m. Mr Michael Peagram, chairman, said he
first approached Reckitt about the business four years ago and a deal was
nearly agreed last November. But Holliday was forced to pull out after its
shares slumped following a profit warning.
The shares have since recovered allowing the deal to proceed. 'I would have
been very peeved if we had missed it,' said Mr Peagram.
The original plan for a rights issue of convertible preference shares was
scrapped last week as market yields rose. But Mr Peagram stressed that the
deal would still enhance Holliday's earnings per share.
RCI made a Pounds 6.2m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 29.4m last year and
Holliday is paying only 12.5 times historic earnings. Its shares fell 9p to
201p.
After the write-off of goodwill Holliday's pro forma gearing will rise to 65
per cent but Mr Peagram said it could still afford to make another Pounds
20m acquisition without issuing more shares. He ruled out a further rights
issue before the end of this year.

FT  29 MAR 94 / OFT attacks copier industry over selling 'malpractices'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unscrupulous selling practices in the UK photocopier industry were condemned
yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading after a 17-month investigation.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the investigation
had 'revealed an extraordinary variety of malpractices and excesses'. But he
has decided against immediate legislation to clean up the industry, calling
instead for greater transparency in photocopier contracts.
Business was partly to blame for allowing malpractices to flourish by
failing to shop around or recognise the importance of photocopier contracts,
he said.
The industry had made progress through trade associations towards reducing
unacceptable selling practices and deserved the opportunity to show
self-regulation could work. He warned that if progress was not maintained he
would use his powers to revoke consumer credit licences and could refer the
supply of photocopiers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The decision to give self-regulation a chance was welcomed by the Finance &amp;
Leasing Association and the Photocopier Suppliers Association, both of which
have produced guidelines. The Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts
criticised the OFT report for its 'lack of sanctions in dealing with clearly
identified problems'.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said he would table a
Commons motion calling for legislation to compensate the thousands who had
been duped by unscrupulous photocopier and leasing companies.
The most common problems identified by the OFT were: contract periods much
longer than the lives of equipment; obscure and steep escalations of service
charges; and costly settlement terms - not disclosed in advance - when a
business wanted to end a contract early.
Sir Bryan said lease and service-inclusive, cost-per-copy, contracts with an
obligation to pay for a minimum volume of usage, had caused particular
problems. Some customers found themselves facing unavoidable escalating
service charges.
The director-general said he would carry out a further review early next
year. In the meantime he wanted to see a number of improvements in
practices.
Settlements should reflect only losses suffered by the leasing company or
dealer from early termination of the contract. Trade associations should
also discourage lease and service-inclusive cost-per-copy contracts.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Move on flight control sell-off: Break-up of UK aviation
authority set to be pushed forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to press forward later this week with its
proposal to privatise the Civil Aviation Authority's air traffic control
services.
Under the plan, the CAA would retain its role as a regulatory agency but all
air traffic control services would form part of a new private body.
The move would enable the CAA to tap financial markets to help fund a Pounds
400m modernisation programme, but is expected to spark concerns over safety.
Critics also question the privatisation of a service aimed at giving
airlines and passengers best value and lowest costs since the new body would
be under pressure to improve margins.
The government announced its intention to privatise the CAA's National Air
Traffic Services in the November budget, when it said it would set up a
working party to draw up proposals.
These have now been completed and the government is expected to announce on
Thursday its decision to launch the necessary consultation process ahead of
privatisation.
The CAA has already split its air traffic control operations from its
regulatory activities and these have been run with increasing managerial
efficiency. This has been reflected in an improvement in air traffic flows
to and from the UK. Average delays on outbound flights fell by 39 per cent
from 1992 to 1993 and delays on inbound flights fell by 23 per cent during
the same period.
Investments in air traffic control infrastructure are expected to total
about Pounds 400m between now and the end of the century and the government
is keen to encourage private funding for these projects.
The CAA has already started developing an air traffic service centre in
Hampshire and another centre is now scheduled to be built near Glasgow to
replace the older facilities at Prestwick.
Until now, the government has set the CAA a target of 8 per cent return on
capital. In the year to March 1993, the CAA made a profit of Pounds 11m on
turnover of Pounds 569m. Air traffic control accounts for about two-thirds
of the CAA's total payroll of 7,300.
The CAA shares air traffic control facilities with the Ministry of Defence,
which is responsible for military air space and some commercial flights,
including Concorde supersonic flights.
Another potential problem with privatisation is the fact that UK air traffic
control charges are collected by the European Eurocontrol agency and paid
back to the CAA. Modifications would probably have to be made if the UK
decided to set up a private air traffic control agency.

FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Oil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways of looking at yesterday's fall in the oil price. One is
that the 5 per cent drop in Brent crude was a clear thumbs down for the Opec
meeting in Geneva. The other is that, now that the chance of effective
production cuts has passed, the price is simply returning to levels before
that meeting. Indeed the oil price could meet some resistance to attempts to
push it much below Dollars 13. At that level, oil would become increasingly
competitive with coal.
The equity market erred yesterday on the side of pessimism. Shell, which
thanks to its downstream strength is less affected by movements in the crude
price, rose slightly. BP slipped 2 per cent, Enterprise 3. Lasmo, the most
vulnerable of the production companies, has now slipped some 10 per cent
since early February. Yet share valuations depend more heavily on where the
oil price settles rather than on the extent of any short-run dip as a
surplus builds up in the second quarter.
The share movements are more understandable in that the arguments for the
promised recovery in the oil price later in the year look flimsy. Though
this would reflect the usual seasonal pattern, it is hard to see Opec
becoming more disciplined in the face of hardening demand. The threat of
resumed Iraqi supply also hangs over the market. Perhaps, though, only a
change as large as that would make the cartel willing to confront the quota
issue.

FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: British Land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Ritblat is making steady progress through the Pounds 1bn honey-pot
that is the British Land-Quantum property fund. With around 40 per cent of
the fund invested following yesterday's Pounds 128m acquisition from Royal
Insurance, there is no immediate pressure to come up with the next deal. The
snag is that so many institutional investors have rediscovered a taste for
property since Quantum arrived on the scene last summer. Royal is a rare
seller, having decided that its capital would be better invested in more
liquid assets.
While most life insurance and pension funds are net buyers, though, there
are precious few bargains to be had. The price paid yesterday for the old
Sterling Estates portfolio is hardly cheap. A yield of around 8.2 per cent
demands a lot from the rag-bag of retail, office and industrial space. Even
allowing for some modest increase in rents, British Land will have to bring
all its management and trading skills to bear.
It is a measure of the stock market's faith that British Land has avoided
the worst of the correction suffered by others in the sector this year.
While Land Securities has underperformed by 12 per cent since the turn of
the year, for example, British Land has merely tracked the falling equity
market. Still, British Land is being coy about where the 2m shares which
comprise part of yesterday's purchase price will come from. If Quantum is
reducing its stake, other shareholders would have reason to take notice.

FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bid for Westland has always felt a bit rum. Given that the companies
know each other well, have apparently got on well in the past, and agree
that the dispute is over price, this is an issue which should be settled
around a negotiating table. That it hasn't been perhaps reflects the large
gap between what GKN is happy to pay and what Westland thinks it is worth.
Still, having pursued an aggressive route, it is now decision day for Sir
David Lees, GKN's chairman. Practical considerations mean that he must
launch any revised bid by Thursday morning. If Sir David pays up enough he
might be able to buy enough shares in the market and have control by
lunchtime. If he shoots low, he risks getting no acceptances at all. He then
has to wait until 1995, when his stake will have been diluted down to 40 per
cent and more Westland orders may have materialised.
How much GKN is prepared to improve its offer depends on its assessment of
profits in 1996-97, rather than Westland's 1994 forecast. GKN may be mean
given how hard it has been to sweat profits from its engineering business in
recent years. GKN's corporate financiers are doubtless devising ways of
fiddling with any settlement of Westland's long-running legal dispute to
sweeten its bid. After all the rhetoric, however, it would be surprising if
GKN offered much more than 320p against the 290p opener. Shareholders may
put the potential for orders and profits higher. GKN's large stake makes the
issue finely balanced. But without a bigger improvement, the chances are
that everyone will be back to do it all again next year.

FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Inching forwards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market cuffed Inchcape round the ear like an errant schoolchild
yesterday after the trading company handed in some disappointing sums. The 7
per cent fall in Inchcape's shares is yet another illustration of the
market's petulance: Coats Viyella, Bowater, and Wellcome have all suffered
the same fate after making similarly lukewarm trading comments. Inchcape's
chief bugbear is the continuing strength of the yen, which makes life
awkward given the heavy reliance on Japanese goods. But the savage downturn
in the European car market has also inflicted pain. Inchcape has done well
to soften the blow by lifting Toyota car volumes 24 per cent in the UK. Even
that success, though, was bought at the expense of higher advertising and
promotion costs.
It could be argued that both these factors were exceptional and may unwind
by the end of the year. But violent currency swings and regional recessions
must count as an occupational hazard for an international distribution
group. It is a tribute to Inchcape's management skills that a consistent
string of good results has masked the unforgiving nature of its basic
business.
With operating margins of about 4 per cent, Inchcape remains highly
vulnerable to disappointment. The inherent volatility suggests Inchcape
should trade at a discount to the market rather than the premium it has
recently enjoyed. Inchcape's steady growth in China undoubtedly gives the
company added long-term investment appeal. But recent austerity measures in
mainland China, which have depressed car imports, argue for caution on that
front, too.

FT  29 MAR 94 / A Europe that deserves support: Leon Brittan outlines a
strategy for rebuilding confidence in the EU - and its competitiveness -
after recent crises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEON BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strange paradox lies at the heart of the European Union, a paradox that
mirrors the ambivalence so many Europeans currently feel towards the rest of
the continent. In times of crisis the Union is seen to have let its peoples
down, notably by failing to act to stop the killing in Bosnia; at other
times it is cast as a secretive, self-inflating bureaucracy bent on
over-regulating the lives of its citizens just to keep its staff in
business. It is at once too powerful and yet not powerful enough, a beast
showing the strength of a bear and the timidity of a door-mouse, and both on
the wrong occasions.
For many, Europe has temporarily lost its bearings. Recent history helps
explain why: the painful reunification of Europe has collided with the
deepest recession since the 1930s, leaving the shining emblems of a bold and
prosperous Europe in the 1980s looking tarnished alongside the unemployment
of the 1990s. As the Danes rejected Maastricht and the money-changers
gambled on France doing the same, it seemed the dominoes of Europe's
delicate consensus in favour of integration were falling one by one.
Europe must rebuild the confidence shaken from it by recent history to face
the tough decisions that history has now thrust upon it. The countries of
central and eastern Europe, fearful of backsliding in Russia, are knocking
ever louder at the Union's door; the vexed question of monetary union is now
resurfacing; Bosnia has exposed the need for a shared foreign and security
policy but also the immense obstacles to achieving it; the interdependence
of the world economy is calling on Europe to restore its industrial
competitiveness, and seemingly unstoppable growth in Asia is telling it to
do so fast.
If the Union is to confront these issues with unity and resolve, it needs to
carry the people with it. This, above all, means putting the principle of
subsidiarity - enshrined in law for the first time in the Maastricht treaty
 -to work.
Subsidiarity, properly practised, should defy the pro- and anti-federalists
alike, for it means striking a balance between intervention and abstention,
allowing decision-making to settle at the most appropriate level. It is not
a static principle but one which should allow for the ebb and flow of
responsibility between regional, national and European authorities,
according to the need for Europeans to act alone or together at any moment.
If it is to stall excessive centralisation, the burden of proof must fall on
those arguing for decisions to be taken by the Union itself, and the least
restrictive instrument should be used. All legislation should be screened
accordingly, and no powers should be set in stone - indeed, there may be
cases where national governments have acquired the expertise to perform the
task hitherto allotted to the Union just as adequately, and the reins could
then be handed back to them. Knowing when to stop will, therefore, be
instrumental in restoring the Union's credibility.
But equally, the true application of the principle of subsidiarity means
that, where acting together at European Union level enables something more
desirable to be achieved more effectively, the Union should not hesitate to
take the necessary action. Europe's collective achievements - the creation
of a unified market and effective single policies on competition and trade,
for example - should have proved to its detractors by now that team work at
European level can enable each country to score more highly for itself than
it could have done alone, however tiresome its team-mates may seem at times.
Yet widespread distrust persists. The Union's duty, therefore, is not simply
to accrue power when times are good and wash its hands of those
responsibilities when times are bad: it is to assist governments in the
search for the best level at which to take each decision, and draw ordinary
people into that process.
To do that, the democratic element in the European Union must be reinforced.
With 12 national parliaments and one European Parliament all empowered to
scrutinise European laws, Europe has considerable means of democratic
expression, but much of that potential is wasted. National parliaments
seldom analyse European laws with the degree of scrutiny those laws deserve.
They appear to exert little influence over their ministers when the latter
meet at Union level to adopt new laws. Often national and European MPs are
locked in opposition, one suspecting the other of tugging policy too far
towards, or away from, the centre of Europe.
This need not be. For, if harnessed jointly to the decision-making wheel,
they would complement each other. Through a Committee of Parliaments,
national MPs could be assigned specific powers alongside their counterparts
in the Strasbourg assembly, so reassuring voters that power over their lives
is not ebbing abroad to bodies they did not elect.
The Committee of Parliaments could ensure power was exercised at the right
level and on the right legal grounds: it could watch over subsidiarity, with
the power to ask the European Court of Justice to adjudicate if necessary;
ensure laws have the correct legal base (a common battleground among
governments fearing the Union may be growing by stealth); and check when
governments consider extending the Union's authority.
Only if it realises its democratic potential can the Union face the greatest
challenge: the drive to maintain efficiency as it takes in more countries.
The Union's decision-making machinery, which has hardly changed since the
Community began, is already creaking under the weight of 12 countries. It
will creak more loudly with 16, and grind to a halt if Europe enlarges
thereafter. But to lock out central and eastern European countries on these
grounds is inexcusable.
Instead the inter-governmental conference that is to be held in 1996 should
centre on the simple, but intractable question: how should we change the way
the European Union is run to enable us to admit a substantial number of new
countries without the Union grinding to a halt? This involves looking at how
the Union's institutions work: the Commission and the parliament, as well as
the Council of Ministers - and a fresh look at the voting questions which
have caused such agonised debate. But we would also have to widen our
analysis if the countries of eastern and central Europe were to be absorbed
into the Union in due course.
The collapse of communism is forcing a more sharply focused consideration of
Union policy towards its eastern neighbours. The question is no longer one
merely of foreign policy - it is central to the future of the Union itself.
The loss of Soviet markets made east Europeans look west for business, but
the threat of Russian nationalism is sharpening their demand for membership
of the European fold, in economic, political and security terms.
War in Europe, too, is forcing Nato to confront the need for its European
members to develop a more autonomous security policy within the alliance, as
Soviet might gives way to smaller, less easily identifiable security threats
closer home. The old dichotomy between reinforcing the European pillar of
Nato and maintaining the transatlantic link is withering away as the US
encourages Europe's autonomy within the Western European Union and France
begins to shed its staunchly independent view of defence. Developing a true
European pole within Nato, but one also capable of acting outside it under
the WEU, is now realistic and should be encouraged.
The European Union should also gradually lift its remaining barriers to
trade from the east, while urging eastern Europe to adopt competition and
other market rules similar to its own. Yesterday those countries needed aid
and advice on how to build a market economy; today they also need investment
and the infrastructure and economic stability to attract it as painful
reforms take root. The west's role must also be made more visible, to help
prevent people turning their back on those reforms. Ultimately it is
economic prosperity that will weld the continent together, leading to a
joint political future in one Union, each country in its own time.
Prosperity is also the most effective agent of integration in western Europe
 -a lesson apparent from the lack of support for European integration as the
recession and unemployment bite. The Union will sink or swim on its ability
to restore the competitiveness of its economy. Through its role as 'steward'
of Europe, the Union must establish order among a series of often competing
priorities - for example, the protection of Europe's rural communities while
encouraging agriculture to compete without excessive subsidies; or the
creation of a social safety net which does not stifle industry; or the need
to close the wealth gap by bringing poor countries up to richer ones, and
not vice versa. Any attempt to muddle through - merely to 'manage' these
issues rather than to introduce real reform where necessary - will not work.
The reason is that one priority thwarts all others: the need to compete on
world markets.
Only a detailed and dispassionate analysis of Europe's economic woes can
find a common cure. This process has begun with the Commission's white paper
on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. It is clear the Union must pursue
existing policies with renewed vigour, for example by completing the single
market; loosening the grip that monopolies still hold over Europe's
transport, energy and communications networks, while channelling private
capital more smoothly into those networks; and ensuring that we and our
competitors abide by the stringent new trade rules agreed in the Uruguay
Round. We also need improved research to turn good ideas into market-beating
exports; to encourage the growth of small companies and entrepreneurship; to
reduce state subsidies to ailing enterprises; and to ensure more efficient
spending of the Union budget, not just by quashing fraud but also by
shifting staff more quickly to confront new challenges.
Of the cures, two of the most potent are also among the most controversial.
First Europe has to improve the versatility of its workforce. This does not
mean neglecting health and safety, or hiring and firing for short-term gain;
rather, it means removing rigidities which discourage employers from
creating jobs, and correcting the mismatch between the skills people learn
and those they require for the posts available. The Union itself can remove
barriers to workers seeking jobs abroad; provide 'marriage guidance' for
industries looking for the most suitable training schemes in Europe; and
help distil conflicting national views on social policy into common
principles upon which European industry can rely, not through coercion but
through debate. This will help governments shift their focus away from
merely protecting old industries towards propagating new ones.
Secondly, the European currency crisis has not destroyed the Continental
consensus in favour of a single currency, although it has shifted the debate
over how to achieve it and by when. Far from exploiting their monetary
freedom after the crisis, most EU countries have followed fiscal and
monetary policies consistent with the approach laid down in Maastricht. In
fact they have not used the greater freedom given to them by the wider band
in the revised ERM. It might be, however, that the best way of achieving Emu
would be to seek agreement on a trans-Union non-inflationary monetary
target, and for each country to be able to lower interest rates, provided
this would not risk breaching that target. This might mean more rapid
emergence from recession and a pattern of exchange rates based on economic
fundamentals which could, in due course, provide the basis for a single
currency. That goal seems to me to be as valid and as attainable as ever,
even if by slightly different means.
It is ironic that people are most tempted to spurn the European Union when
their countries' need for it is greatest. Grafting a split continent back
together is no mean feat, particularly when it forces radical change to the
structure of the European house and brings fresh competition to an economy
grappling with recession. The overarching aim must be to achieve that unity
while assuring Europe's place in an ever more competitive world. It can only
be done by a Union that is democratic, transparent and restrained enough in
its actions to be confident and deserving of the public support it needs.
This article is based on Europe: The Europe we need, a book by Sir Leon
Brittan, EU Trade Commissioner, which will be published by Hamish Hamilton
on Thursday.

<TEXT>
Nice to see religious neutrality creeping in to some parts of Moslem Turkey.
Sunday's municipal elections for city mayors saw the local election
committee of the small Istanbul district of Kuzguncuk set up polling
stations in the village's Greek Orthodox Church; its Armenian church; and in
one of two synagogues.
Of course, cynics might interpret it as just a way of stifling the Islamic
radical vote.

Inspired by the Weekend FT's article on 'cyberspace', the free-floating
electronic community created by computer users all round the world, one
colleague has made a nasty discovery.
Electronic communication is even more cliche-ridden than the old-fashioned
kind.
Cyber-correspondents rejoice in turning their most frequently used cliches
into acronyms. Messages are spattered with jargon like GMTA ('Great minds
think alike'), IMHO ('in my humble opinion'), which must have them ROTFL
('rolling on the floor laughing'). There is even an electronic counterpart
to the letter writer's SWALK ('sealed with a loving kiss') - NIFOC ('naked
in front of computer').

Cleansing Italy's Augean stables of corruption has not best pleased
hoteliers across the border at Switzerland's chic Alpine resort of St
Moritz. They have seen Italian tourist figures drop by more than 20 per cent
during the winter season. One local tourism official reckons to know why:
'Some of our best customers are in jail.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edzard Reuter's new job as chairman of the supervisory board of Airbus
Industrie is good news for the other Airbus partners - British Aerospace,
France's Aerospatiale and Spain's Casa.
One of Europe's best known and most politically astute industrial managers
is arriving at the helm at a time when the European consortium is facing
increasing pressure from its big US rival, Boeing.
It should also dispel rumours, once and for all, that Daimler was becoming
increasingly disenchanted with its costly diversification into aerospace.
Only last month Daimler said that the 66-year-old Reuter, who has been with
the group for 30 years, would remain chairman of its management board until
the end of next year and he has been tipped to replace Deutsche Bank's
Hilmar Kopper as chairman of Daimler's supervisory board.
He's a much more effective business figure than his two predecessors, Hans
Friderichs, 62, a former federal economics minister, and Franz-Josef
Strauss, the first supervisory board chairman who died in office.
Meanwhile, the battle for Reuter's own succession at Daimler is now on. The
favourites are Helmut Werner, boss of the Mercedes car company, and his
younger colleague, Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler's
aerospace arm. Observer's bet is on Schrempp getting the job.

Good news for Rotherham's Liberal Democrats, now gearing up for a
by-election; they are guaranteed acres of media coverage. The bad news is -
they may not appreciate all the fuss.
Their choice of candidate is David Wildgoose. We haven't seen his manifesto
yet but any references to 'chase', 'ducking issues', 'flat-footed opponents'
and the like should be winged immediately and sent for roasting at No 1
Southwark Bridge.

No wonder the Tories are divided over Europe; some of them don't even know
where it begins. At least that's the conclusion that might be drawn from a
gaffe by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, MP for Edinburgh West and junior
minister in the Scottish Office.
He recently entertained a delegation of MPs from the far north. They were
eagerly lobbying for separate tourist boards for the Hebrides, and for
Orkney and Shetland. He listened pensively and, following an awkward pause,
asked: 'Um, where would that leave the Faroes?'
In Denmark, surely?

FT  29 MAR 94 / Observer: A paradoxical business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If you've written one book selling 8m copies, isn't it a trifle hubristic
aiming for the jackpot again? Not for John Naisbitt, 65, now circling the
globe on behalf of his latest offering, called Global Paradox.
At 39, Naisbitt left IBM to go into consultancy. He then made his name in
the 1980s with Megatrends, now featuring on MBA reading lists everywhere.
Global Paradox threatens to be even bigger, thanks to its teasing sub-title:
'the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smallest players'. In
London, where economic angst has become almost second nature, Naisbitt
pooh-poohed the suggestion that Britain has slumped to south European status
but without the benefit of regular sunshine; though he does rather fancy
Latin America's emerging markets.
'There's a renaissance in UK entrepreneurial activity, which isn't happening
in continental Europe,' he says. Quick - there goes another paradox] UK plc
mounting a revival as a post-industrial emerging market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd exhibited all the skills of a conjuror in the account he
gave yesterday to the House of Commons of the Ioannina compromise, on which
he and his cabinet colleagues have to take a decision this morning.
The first time he went through it, it sounded for all the world as though
Britain had won. In cases where states holding 23 votes or more were against
a proposal, the Commission and the presidency would make every effort to
seek a consensus, and there would be no time limit. Only when he went over
it the second time did it slip out that in the last resort, when all such
efforts had been exhausted, the proposal would be adopted unless 27 or more
votes were cast against it.
Mr Hurd moved on with such alacrity, holding the House bemused with his
effortless mastery of so much complex detail, that few MPs seemed actually
to hear the dreaded figure 27 pass his lips. And none of those that caught
the Speaker's eye was quick-witted enough to pin him down on the crucial
point, which is how it will be decided that the search for consensus is
exhausted and that the last resort has arrived.
According to senior EU officials, quoted in yesterday's Financial Times, the
answer to this question is contained in the words 'always respecting the
Rules of Procedure of the Council'. This means that the procedural decision
will be taken by a simple majority, on a vote which can be called by any one
member state. In other words, Britain will not be able to block legislation
unless it can muster 27 negative votes - precisely what ministers have
claimed it is essential to avoid.
Mr Hurd said he had secured two important concessions. One is that the above
arrangement will be 'legally binding'. The other is that it will last only
until the end of the 1996 intergovernmental conference (IGC), which will now
deal with the issue of the blocking minority as well as with the relative
voting weight of different member states. This is actually not a concession
at all, since whatever happens in 1996 there will not be agreement to reduce
the blocking minority.
That Mr Hurd took such trouble to camouflage the deal on offer makes it
clear that he is desperately hoping the cabinet will accept it. His refusal
to 'recommend' it in so many words merely preserves his options if the
cabinet rejects his advice. He is not a resigner by nature, but he surely
must make it clear to his colleagues that if they reject this offer they
will put him in an impossible position.
Spain has already accepted it, so Britain would find itself isolated. There
is no chance of wringing further concessions from the other member states.
And the issue has already been blown up far beyond its real importance.
As Mr Hurd reminded the House yesterday, Britain's 'veto' is not at stake.
It is only the voting procedure for certain specific categories of
legislation. The number of proposals in these categories during 1995 and
1996 which Britain will wish to oppose, and against which it can muster more
than 22 but fewer than 27 votes, can hardly be very great, and might even be
smaller than the number it will wish to see adopted but which could be
blocked by the same number of votes from other states. And while Britain has
good reasons to wish to restrict the competences of the EU, it should not
wish to make decisions more difficult in areas where EU competence has been
accepted by all member states.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Selling copiers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caveat emptor is a basic principle which all buyers should observe when
entering the market. But a business that expects to take advantage of its
customers' failure to observe the principle is adopting a risky strategy.
Buyers hit by underhand selling techniques are unlikely to engage in further
transactions with companies that have ripped them off.
Yet shady selling practices appear to have become commonplace in the supply
of photocopiers in the UK. According to a report published yesterday by the
Office of Fair Trading, some photocopier dealers and leasing companies are
guilty of 'misrepresentation, obfuscation and deceit'. They use leasing
arrangements to overcharge for the equipment, impose steep annual increases
in service charges and tie their customers up in contracts that last far
longer than the equipment they supply. Their customers discover they have
been conned only after signing lease contracts with penal termination
clauses.
Some of the businesses caught by these methods have been large companies
that ought to know better. They can afford the legal expertise to scrutinise
the small print in contracts and demand clarification on lease terms. But
most are small businesses, including professionals such as doctors,
surveyors and financial advisers. And 15 per cent of an OFT sample of
complaints on the subject were colleges or schools, housing associations,
churches, clubs or other social groups. They are unlikely to have acquired
the business acumen to spot a bad deal.
The problem lies in the opaque nature of leasing contracts which often omit
the cost of the equipment, the implied interest rate and the charges on
early termination. Many buyers lack the experience to demand such
information or to understand the overall cost of the lease. They are also
subjected to cold-calling and high-pressure sales techniques.
The problem is compounded by the unfamiliarity of the product. Car leasing
is largely free of unscrupulous practices because most buyers have a grasp
of the economics of the car ownership. They do not sign leases that last
longer than the cars. They can weigh the monthly payments against well-known
prices and likely service costs. Customers are less businesslike in
acquiring office products, predictably so in the case of small businesses
and public bodies.
Much of this could be dealt with by self-regulation. There is a limited
number of large companies making photocopiers and providing the lease
finance. Some are household names with reputations at risk from the
unscrupulous methods of those who sell their products. They all have an
interest in cleaning up their industry and avoiding practices that destroy
relationships with their customers.
Central to improving the industry's reputation is greater transparency in
the nature of the transaction. It is hard to see why businesses leasing
photocopiers should be denied the sort of basic financial information
required for credit sales of domestic consumer goods by the Consumer Credit
Act 1974. And contracts must embody the OFT's recommendations for clear
explanation of costs and penalties. If the companies involved cannot provide
this without compulsion, legislation may be inevitable.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Leading Article: En retraite
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To be forced to retreat on one front may be regarded as a misfortune; to
retreat on several fronts in succession looks like carelessness. By
abandoning his controversial youth wage law in the face of student protests,
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has not merely reinforced the
impression that he is a soft touch for domestic interest groups. He has also
augmented a sense of drift in economic and social policy that threatens to
make the task of governing France immeasurably more difficult in the months
to come.
This is a climbdown every bit as damaging as Mr Balladur's decision last
autumn to scrap a much-needed restructuring of Air France after worker
protests. It also stands in odd contrast to the firm support he has given to
the hard franc policy of the newly independent Bank of France.
The plan to pay young workers in training 80 per cent of the minimum wage
may have seemed more like tinkering than a full-blown attack on youth
unemployment. But it was an important symbol of the government's desire for
supply side reforms. Jettisoning it demonstrates just how far France is from
getting to grips with the structural rigidities - such as the inflated
minimum wage itself - that underlie its sluggish economic performance.
In mitigation it may be argued that, one year after his appointment, Mr
Balladur is not master in his own house. His youth wage plan did not enjoy
unanimous support in the governing coalition. Had he persisted, he might
have put the stability of his government - and his own presidential
ambitions - in serious jeopardy.
It is not clear, however, that withdrawing the measure will smooth his path.
On the contrary, by failing honestly to explain his intentions in
introducing the measure and then shifting tack, he has undermined his most
prized asset: an image of quiet competence. France needs greater clarity and
firmness of purpose from its prime minister if it is to emerge strengthened
from the current recession.

FT  29 MAR 94 / 2001: a Tory odyssey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every government needs a sense of direction. A cabinet without focus can
lose its way, as the then Mr Harold Wilson discovered after 1966 and 1974.
Parties have always been happier when united around an agreed overall
objective. Building a 'socialist' society seemed at the time to justify the
post-1945 Labour government. Its Conservative successor chanted 'bonfire of
controls' as wartime rationing was swept aside. In the 1980s the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher plausibly described what she was up to as rolling back the
frontiers of the state.
A suitable purpose for a British administration in the 1990s would be to
produce a properly educated next generation, equipped to compete in global
markets. To say this, and to know the unhappy fate of Mr Kenneth Baker's
well-intentioned plans to reform publicly financed teaching, is to weep. It
is not a thought to dwell upon. An alternative national aim could be to
place the United Kingdom at the heart of Europe, the corollary being that
the effectiveness of many British institutions would be enhanced by learning
from their French, German or other counterparts. Such an open-minded
approach is not possible, given the prevailing mood in the Conservative
party. Unbelievably, it is still arguing about how many votes are needed to
stop continental Europeans from acting contrary to what Tories deem to be
British interests. With a sigh, we must scratch heart-of-Europe from our
banner.
All is not lost. If no mission statement is available, the next best glue
for a polity is a project, preferably one in which many can be involved, and
all can feel pride. The Citizen's Charter was intended to be such an
enterprise, but it has not set the nation's heart a-flutter. Never fear. Two
other possibilities - the millennium celebrations and the liberalisation of
the media and communications businesses - could be exploited. They are not
necessarily unrelated. Either or both could rekindle optimism in a society
whose spirit has been cast down by the double weight of an unfortunate
government and an uninspiring opposition.
The first of these undertakings is in the hands of Mr Peter Brooke, the
secretary for the national heritage; the second depends to a degree on his
department's input. This is curious. Mr Brooke is a high Tory, the son of a
much-maligned former home secretary. Once chairman of the Conservatives, he
camouflages his intelligence by affecting the manner of an old buffer.
Reconciled to the backbenches, he was recalled to the cabinet in 1992 after
the enforced departure from the government of Mr David Mellor. Many of us
expressed doubt about Mr Brooke's elevation then. Yet by a strange quirk of
politics this 19th century figure has become the impresario of two potential
star turns of the second half of the 90s - the national lottery and one of
its beneficiaries, the millennium fund. He is also one of four ministers who
plan to deregulate the production and dissemination of information and
entertainment. The other three are the prime minister, the trade secretary
and the chancellor.
If all goes well, the winner of the lottery contract will be announced in
time for the dice to be rolling by the autumn. That would produce income for
Mr Brooke's millennium committee. He expects it to rake in about Pounds 500m
between 1995 and 2000, but acknowledges that the sum could be twice that. He
tells himself that the Treasury will keep its promise not to grab the cash
and run. The committee is already receiving outline bids, although it has
not yet clarified its own thinking. It will probably finance monuments,
millennium events, and bursaries. What remains open is the unifying theme
behind these activities.
The 1851 Great Exhibition, for which Prince Albert took the role now
occupied by Mr Brooke, demonstrated the industrial might of the British
empire. A century later its successor expressed postwar optimism, in
shuttered concrete. It is not clear what inevitably more muted sound the
2000-01 trumpets will emit, but Mr Brooke's contribution, which will surely
be curtailed before long, may be to make it at least harmonious. His eye is
on a respectful representation of British architecture. There are other
possibilities, such as contributing to world culture. I am sure that the
heritage secretary would entertain the suggestion that his fund should
finance the restoration of the bombed library in Sarajevo. The first cheque
could go out before Christmas. Such a gesture would be European without
being divisive.
Not so the 'information superhighway'. Neither wholly British nor entirely
European, this next-century industry will be planet-wide, dominated by large
players. Mind you, it is not as new as Vice-President Albert Gore makes it
sound. More than 10 years ago Mr Baker - he of the 1988 education act - was
junior minister for information technology. He walked with a gleam in his
eyes, talking about linking every house with fibre-optic cables. He sounded
mad. Perhaps he was. It has yet to be demonstrated that the market for new
and recycled films, videos, digitalised information, and multi-media
spectaculars is as large as the dreams of Mr Gore and his like.
Mr Brooke and his fellow-ministers have first to settle little British
difficulties. Next up is the question of to what extent newspapers can own
TV stations, and vice-versa. This is a matter in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has an interest. I suspect the government's broadcasting
bill, when it comes, will liberalise, but not so much that its 17-seat
majority in the House of Commons is destabilised. Mr Brooke had the
parliamentary balance in mind when he cautiously permitted TV companies to
acquire one another.
This Tory pragmatism should not be laughed away. It has its beneficial side.
For example, Mr Brooke's instinct is to preserve British origination of TV
news about Britain. That is not perfect obeisance to the market. The issue
must be resolved: Mr Michael Heseltine muses expansively about a liberated
BBC working hand in glove with a British Telecom freed from prior restraints
on its activities. Come the millennium, they could roam the information
superhighway together, as British Airways does the skies. In skilful hands,
Mr Heseltine's perhaps, this kind of talk could be as intoxicating as 'the
white heat of the technological revolution' sounded 30 years ago.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: PIA looks at symptoms not causes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER TANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The criticisms of the Personal Investment Authority are now familiar
and well rehearsed. The new regime hardly adds up to the 'step change'
called for by Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board. This is because the PIA's scope is limited to regulation of 'conduct
of business' rules, that is sales and marketing practices. Its scope does
not cover 'prudential' regulation, which, in the case of insurance
companies, remains with the Department of Trade and Industry.
The distinction between the supervision of a company's financial strength
and its urge to book new business is arbitrary and unhealthy. From the days
when I used to go along to 'prudential supervisions' at the Bank of England,
I can testify to the Bank's understanding of the risks inherent in such
distinction.
The UK insurance industry is characterised by over-capacity and by cost
structures which are too high. All too often, the senior management response
is to keep the sales machine running ever faster. I suggest that where there
is suggestion of mis-selling and a decline in public confidence, attention
should be aimed at the management approach to structural weaknesses in the
industry, rather than management of the sales force.
By failing to bring together prudential supervision and conduct of business
regulation, the PIA is set up to deal with the symptoms rather than with
their causes. Any move to combine the two would necessitate statutory
regulation.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Cracks in the oil fields: Opec's split over proposals to cut
quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fault-line running down the Gulf emerged at the weekend meeting in Geneva
of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The divide, which has
been created by weak oil prices since the autumn, was exposed when Saudi
Arabia refused to go along with a suggestion by Iran and some other members
that Opec should cut production to stimulate prices.
The split will only encourage questions that have been asked increasingly in
recent years about Opec's effectiveness in setting world oil prices. In late
London trading yesterday, benchmark Brent crude was selling at Dollars
13.12, down 70 cents on Friday's close.
Saudi Arabia, on one side of the divide, is owner of the world's largest oil
reserves and Opec's dominant producer, accounting for a third of total
output of 24.52m barrels a day. Weak oil prices have given the country cash
flow problems and caused it to question how long it can maintain the
comprehensive cradle-to-grave welfare system which cossets 12.3m Saudis.
But with Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn in liquid reserves, an estimated Dollars
100bn in deposits held overseas by individual Saudis, and a triple-A credit
rating, there is little doubt that Saudi Arabia can ride out even an
extended period of low oil prices. Saudis may have to tighten their belts a
little, the government may have to delay some spending, but there is no real
hardship.
Riyadh believes the longer-term costs would have been greater, had it agreed
to a production cut: Iran, along with Nigeria and some smaller producers,
might simply have taken advantage of any subsequent price rise and cheated
on their quotas.
Saudi Arabia's wealthy colleagues in the Gulf Co-operation Council -
including big producers such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - share
its cash flow problems. On Saturday, they toed the Saudi line, some more
reluctantly than others.
The view from the other side of the divide could not be more different.
Iran, Saudi Arabia's political adversary in the region, exemplifies the
plight of the poor, heavily populated Opec states which have less oil. It is
heavily indebted with virtually no access to long-term international credit.
Every Dollars 1 fall in the oil price costs Iran about Dollars 1bn in oil
revenues a year. In the six months to the beginning of March, during which
Opec maintained its present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day,
Tehran saw oil revenues fall by Dollars 3.5bn. Its revenue estimates for the
year beginning March 21 have been slashed from Dollars 14bn to just over
Dollars 10bn.
Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, conceded that the decision to
roll over the 24.52m ceiling to the end of the year will result in further
oil price weakness, at least in the short term. In common with other Opec
ministers, he expressed optimism that prices would strengthen in the second
half of the year. Opec observers say he needs to be optimistic, given fears
by diplomats in Tehran that a dip in annual oil revenues to the Dollars
8bn-Dollars 9bn range could force Tehran to cut back on essential imports,
including food, at the risk of political unrest.
Iran's predicament is compounded by persistent reports that technical
problems in its oil fields are making it hard for it to meet its production
quota of 3.6m barrels a day. Bargaining power in the cartel flows from oil
production capacity. Any admission that quotas are going unfulfilled will be
met by a chorus of demands that any unused portions be doled out to other,
more deserving cases.
Mr Aghazadeh went to considerable lengths to persuade fellow delegates that
Iran's sustainable capacity was 4.2m barrels a day. His sensitivity was such
that he invited the press to attend well-flow tests later this year to prove
the point.
Among the other members, Nigeria proposed cutting production by as much as 6
per cent. Like Iran, Nigeria has economic difficulties. It also has to worry
about capacity: western oil companies foresee a decline in Nigeria's output
of oil as early as next year, unless the government increases investment in
production and exploration this year.
Opec observers do not expect the strains which emerged at the weekend to
break the cartel. After all, they say, it survived the Iran-Iraq and Gulf
wars. An Iraqi representative still attends meetings, even though its oil
exports are barred by UN sanctions.
Moreover, many of the Opec meeting participants saw low oil prices as
transitory. On Saturday officials from Gulf states described how, within
nine months, oil prices might move from five-year lows and record steady
rises. But the officials accepted that because output has not been cut at a
time of year when world oil demand is usually at its lowest point, Opec is
in for a rocky few months.
They also cited the prospect of stronger, though perhaps still weak,
economic recovery in Japan and western Europe as an additional factor
pointing to higher prices. The Iranians, however, do not share such a rosy
view, and will continue to clamour for a cut.
But the officials conceded that only increased cash flows brought about by
higher prices could paper over the chasm between Opec haves and have-nots.
There is a danger that the disgruntled Iranians or Nigerians may exacerbate
that division by cheating on their quotas - trying to increase revenues
without an oil price rise. Mr Aghazadeh said he 'was not satisfied with
Saudi explanations of why Saudi Arabia couldn't cut' output.
Mr Don Etiebet, Nigeria's oil minister, would only say his country would 'do
its best' to adhere to its quota. And even though Iran may indeed be having
difficulty in meeting the quota, Saudi Arabia knows that oil field operators
can achieve big short-term increases in output if they are willing to lose
some of the long-term reserves of a field.
Even if the Saudi vision is fulfilled and higher prices materialise by
year-end, Opec is likely to experience further after-shocks from this
weekend's events.
They highlighted the fact that Opec's main weapon since quotas were
introduced in the early 1980s - supply management - is proving ineffective
in a world where technology and the end of the cold war are opening up new
sources of oil supply at ever lower costs.
Opec's divisions also show that Saudi Arabia's oil policy, thought to be set
by King Fahd himself, looks at more than just short-term prices. He also
appears anxious to ensure oil's longer-term future as a commodity. With
reserves which will last for 100 years or more, Saudi Arabia still sees
itself as the guardian of oil's pre-eminent place in the world's energy mix.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: More loans no help to Russian economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have read with interest your coverage of International Monetary Fund
negotiations with Russia. The Russian economy clearly has not adjusted to
market principles, and another Dollars 1.5bn loan is as useful as pouring
petrol into a broken engine.
A justification would be the avoidance of mass unemployment. But the country
would be better off having some unemployment. The unemployment rate is only
1.5 per cent, but that disguises the fact that millions of Russians work for
a subsistence wage producing goods which go into stockpiles because no one
has the money to buy them. The state would be better off giving a higher
payout for those workers to stay at home.
Let us help the Russians in the transition to a market economy. More loans,
however, protract rather than quicken this process.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RALPH SABRY-GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your surveys of the engineering industry (Ingenuity, September 14 1993
and March 25 1994), have missed a fundamental ingredient in the creation of
wealth. In addition to a financial infrastructure conducive to long-term
investment in appropriate plant, the corresponding investment in people is
essential.
While training and skill-upgrading are the current fashion, they need a
professional foundation to be of real benefit. In recent years, the
professional bodies have demanded higher academic attainment, relevant
postgraduate training and responsible experience before admitting candidates
to corporate membership to raise the overall competence of the registered
engineering community; especially pertinent with the accelerating pace of
technological advance.
Given the pressure of returns on investment and the capital intensity of new
technology, a level of technological expertise corresponding to the
financial supplied by chartered accountants and legal by qualified lawyers
should be a prerequisite. The closer to the point of investment decisions
registered engineers can be found, the better informed technologically such
decisions are likely to be, as our more successful industrial competitors
have shown over several generations.
Coverage of this point and its effect upon our relative industrial
performance would add value to your reviews.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Part-time jobs have profound
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN FRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We were interested in your report, 'Job creation rate disappoints
government' (March 24). In it, the Employment Department states that:
part-time jobs are not all low paid; to dismiss the growth in part-time
employment is an insult to an important part of the workforce; and a robust
approach is needed to counter the bad employment picture that some critics
might portray.
We form a group that is concerned about the growth in part-time employment.
While we are not opposed to part-time work and do not assume that any
part-time post can be changed into a full-time job, we are concerned by the
well documented fact that part-time jobs are low paid when contrasted with
full-time employment.
We are also concerned about the increasingly limited earnings opportunities
for households without a current wage earner and the public expenditure
implications of the move to part-time working.
During a recent study into pay in former wages council industries, we came
across a set of 91 retail vacancies with one employer. All the jobs were
part-time and the average working week was 11.36 hours. Average weekly
income was Pounds 39.05, with only four jobs paying above the national
insurance threshold. We calculated that the total tax and national insurance
paid on the 91 part-time jobs, by employer and employee, would be Pounds
1,470 a year. If the jobs were full-time the 28 equivalent posts would yield
Pounds 41,918.
This highlights the fiscal implications of the increase in part-time
working. Between March and September 1993, there was a fall of 113,000 in
full-time jobs and a rise of 210,000 in part-time jobs in the UK. This
represented an increase of 97,000 jobs, but a decrease, on our calculations,
of about 27,000 full-time equivalent posts. If this trend continues, by the
year 2003 nearly three out of 10 men and 45 per cent of all employees will
be working part-time. This has profound implications.
We do not devalue part-time work. We do not believe part-time workers should
be treated less favourably in law than full-time staff; neither did we argue
in favour of wages council abolition on the grounds that a high proportion
of the workers covered were second earners, mainly working part-time. We
would, however, like to see a more mature debate about employment issues.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Moling' code needed to protect trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON WALSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a shame Raymond Snoddy did not dwell on the environmental
benefits which the mole method of cable and pipe laying would bring ('Mr
Mole wants to bury TV diggers', March 19/20). My colleagues and I have
become increasingly concerned with the large number of trenching operations
in recent years, which can cause untold damage to the root plates of nearby
trees. Unfortunately, the trees usually survive a few years before they
succumb, by which time they are often condemned as dangerous and felled
completely.
This is a situation which has serious implications for urban street trees,
which in themselves have a vital function in greening our towns and cities.
There is an economic consequence, too, for the local council has to pick up
the costs of dealing with the damaged trees and for their replacement. In
the rural environment, with new water and gas mains squeezed between roads
and hedgerow, mature country trees are also under threat.
The mole appears to go some way to addressing this problem, as one presumes
it passes safely beneath the root plate, thereby minimising damage to the
tree. One is encouraged by the recent, timely launch of a campaign to raise
awareness of the damage trenching does to trees, but we may need more than
this. Many 'trenchers' have statutory powers which can bypass local
authority tree protection control, and I feel that a robust code of practice
must be agreed, but that if this fails, then statutory measures are required
to protect the hidden and particularly vulnerable parts of the trees we so
often take for granted.

<TEXT>
Today's semi-final in the Young Musician Of The Year competition is for
string players (6.55 BBC2).
You could switch to Channel 4 at 9.00 and stay for four and a half hours.
Without Walls begins with a report on Britain's cultural heritage as seen by
Europeans who live here 'but whose affection for England and the English
doesn't stop them from taking a clear-eyed look at our strengths and
weaknesses'. Given our supposed inadequacies in cuisine, dress sense, and
sex, it will be interesting to see what strengths we are allowed. The second
half (9.30) sustains the European theme: Isambard Kingdom Brunel returns
from the dead to inspect the Channel Tunnel.
That is followed by Betty Blue, a 1986 French movie about love and
obsession, noted for its sexual explicitness. This version is the director's
cut which means three hours instead of two. The longer version is said to be
slower and less amusing (10.00).
In Omnibus the admirable Patricia Routledge plays Sister Hildegard, a 12th
century nun, scientist, painter, and composer (10.25 BBC1).

FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: A languorous look back at Venus and the myth - William
Packer explores an exhibition of sculpture at the Liverpool Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each generation redefines its ideal of Woman in terms of its current
pre-occupations and aesthetic. Ever since Paris first sat in judgement on
the Three Graces, the story has been the same. Juno may have tried to bribe
him with the offer of supreme power and Minerva with military glory, but
Venus was always going to win. Sex and beauty always do.
The Tate Gallery in Liverpool, continuing its excellent programme of small
exhibitions that inform the richness of the gallery's own collections, is
looking at those sculptors of the avant-garde who were working in Paris in
the 50 years or so after 1890. The theme is the idealised, or at least
formalised, female nude - which, in its inevitable symbolic aspect, is to
the artist always Venus.
Any such catch-all approach is fair enough, and this particular title of
Venus Re-defined need not be taken too literally. Even so, the territorial
limitation to Paris is to be regretted.
How good it would have been, for example, to have had an early reclining
figure by Henry Moore to set beside the Matisse and Laurens horizontales;
and alongside Zadkine's totemic Venus, some ruder German Expressionist
figure by Kirchner or Heckel. The point, perhaps, as is so often with these
small and pilot exercises, is for a larger, more ambitious project then to
propose itself.
As to the present exhibition, for all the talk of Venus - given in the
actual titles of the works by Renoir and Zadkine - and of Rodin's Cybele and
Maillol's Three Nymphs, there is no question here of classical pastiche or
pre-occupation. Whatever classical reference there is appears incidental
rather than central, a matter of passing interest and general sympathy, no
more than the simple monumentality of a sculptural presence, the shift of
weight, the swing of a hip in a standing pose, or the languorous turn of the
figure at rest.
More to the point is the fact that all these artists, from Rodin in the
1890s to Laurens in the 1940s, engaged directly as they were with the
principles and practices of modernism and the avant-garde, should have seen
the female life model, set up in conventional, even archetypal, fashion as
the normal and appropriate vehicle for the development of their ideas. How
remote this seems from our own experience, when working from the figure is
considered an anachronistic irrelevance, if not actively condemned as
exploitation.
Matisse's four monumental relief studies, which dominate the show, were made
for his own purposes and not shown in public until after his death in 1954.
The earliest dates from around 1910, the last from 1930, and each takes the
same image of the standing woman seen from behind. So we follow him in his
radical simplification of the image, abstracted almost to the point of
abstraction. But was it ever, in his mind, a Venus re-defined? Autumn by
Laurens, a large reclining figure of 1948, is an actively voluptuous and
surreal composition of abstracted fruit-like forms, writhing and thrusting.
Venus? Perhaps she is. And Maillol's Three Nymphs, a monumental reworking of
the familiar group? Indeed.
Other displays at the Liverpool Tate currently include In Light of the
Other, the touring exhibition of work by Californian video artist Gary Hill.
It was reviewed by my colleague Lynn McRitchie when it was at Oxford last
autumn. The most notable element in the show is the set of inter-active
images of silent figures who seem to notice the viewer as he stops before
them, walk up to him as though to inspect him in the gloom, and turn away as
he himself moves on.
And continuing at the Tate is New Realities 1945-1968, a major international
survey of the painting, and a little of the sculpture, of its period. Drawn
from the Tate's own collections, it is about to enter the third and last of
its annual revisionary phases since it was first hung in 1992.
The survey falls into three self-explanatory parts: turning to the figure;
pursuing abstraction; and towards a new aesthetic, and is particularly
stimulating for the half-forgotten artists it brings back into the light
alongside the more predictable and familiar names - Pignon, Buffet, Gruber,
Coker, Armitage, Self, Solages, Henderson and others - and for the
international and inter-disciplinary comparisons it draws.
Venus Re-defined - sculpture by Rodin, Matisse and contemporaries; Tate
Gallery, Albert Dock, Liverpool, until June 1995; sponsored by David M
Robinson Jewellery. Gary Hill - In Light of the Other - until May 2;

FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Dmitry Hvorostovsky - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A thoughtful gesture towards an English audience opened this recital. There
cannot be many Russian singers who have taken Purcell in their repertoire.
Although Music for a while was not meant to go at a funereal pace, at least
Dmitry Hvorostovsky could use it as an opportunity to show off his
unrivalled breath control.
This young baritone arrived with such a big bang on the international music
scene that he raised exaggerated expectations in many quarters. In recent
years Hvorostovsky has had to proceed carefully. His appearances in opera
have not always gone down well, often because audiences who know his singing
from recordings have been surprised that his lyrical baritone is not more
forceful when they hear it live.
It was a sensible move to put more emphasis on recitals. (Last year's
Russian programme on the South Bank was a noted success.) His Wigmore Hall
recital on Sunday showed that he has started to venture into other
repertory. And it is not just Purcell that he has included, but also Ravel,
in whose Don Quichotte a Dulcinee he was more or less intelligible - a too
youthful Don Quixote perhaps, but Hvorostovsky always has panache. A group
of three rarely-heard Shostakovich songs gave us sombre Russian gravity in
between.
There was a greater rarity to come, however. Audiences in the West have
heard little of those Soviet composers who dutifully toed the party line
(Shostakovich, who seethed with resentment against the regime and wrote the
best music, has monopolised Western attention). Georgy Sviridov has been
neglected but his song cycle, Russia cast adrift, suggests that he might
deserve better. Its musical style is conventional, but Sviridov has a knack
of hitting upon striking and memorable ideas.
The work is a sort of Russian autumn journey, not rivalling Schubert in its
scope, but invoking similar pictures of villages in the frost, circling
flocks of geese, maple trees and willows.
Hvorostovsky sang the piece with such passion and imagination that he may
have made it sound better than it really is. If only his accompanist,
Mikhail Arkadiev, did not hammer away so.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Dee Dee Bridgewater - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such has been the brilliant effect on jazz singing of the three divas - Ella
Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday - that all other voices have
been pushed into the penumbra of popular consciousness.
Of course there are other stars in the galaxy: Dinah Washington delivered
much and promised more; Anita O'Day, Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter have all
done it their way; and Nina Simone has been nobody and everybody's fool. But
none has lit popular music culture like the constellation of
Vaughan-Fitzgerald-Holiday.
By and large, the repertoire of these three female vocalists alone has
served us up to the present time. The ranks have not been replenished and
the art of 'jazz' singing has been frozen in the 1950s style. There are
newcomers, notably Cassandra Wilson and Rachelle Ferrall, who have been
peeping round the corner for a while - both individual stylists, trying a
new way.
Then there is Dee Dee Bridgewater, who finished her long-awaited tour of the
UK at the Manchester Royal Exchange on Sunday. A glamorous and animated
figure, Bridgewater portrays herself as a keeper of the tradition. Indeed, a
new contract with Verve and a new long-player (called, you guessed it,
Keeping Tradition) provide vigorous readings in front of a trio of evergreen
tunes such as Fascinating Rhythm and What is This Thing Called Love?
She has arrived at this point after a varied and glittering apprenticeship.
In the 1970s she sang with the Thad Jones - Mel Lewis Orchestra and later
succeeded Abbey Lincoln in the Max Roach quintet. She went on to record
fusion and pop music and in the mid-1970s took to the stage, winning hearts
and prizes in The Wiz, Sophisticated Ladies and, famously, as Billie Holiday
in the show Lady Day. Now she is settled in Paris, fronting a regular and
snappy trio and, as she said in her preamble, keeping a vocal tradition
alive.
She's well equipped for the job. In bassist Hein van de Geyn she has a
meticulously tidy arranger, and with the addition of Thierry Eliez (piano)
and Dede Ceccarelli (drums), a trio that sparks around her. She is beautiful
and her contact with the audience is sassy and seductive. The voice, if a
little mannered in phrasing, has delicious flexibility and ranges from
gravelly scat to coquettish balladry without effort.
The insidious problem for this listener is a nagging comparison with her
mentors. Bridgewater doesn't have the ever-pressing swing of Fitzgerald, the
emotional contact of Holiday, nor the deep-suffering blues of Washington.
She is musical and she reads the lyrics of standards such as I Fall in Love
Too Easily with clarity and some conviction.
But where is Dee Dee? It might be a commercially heretical suggestion, but
why not dispense with tradition and apply that fine voice to more personal
material?

FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Tom Stoppard's Travesties - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relentless punning, literary allusiveness and political disquisitions of
Tom Stoppard's Travesties, written 20 years ago, is still perhaps a bit much
for West End audiences.
The loudest laughs for Adrian Noble's Royal Shakespeare Company production,
which arrived from the Barbican at the Savoy Theatre last week, were
certainly reserved for the clowning, the gimmickry and song and dance
routines. A speech that quotes or deliberately misquotes TS Eliot,
Wordsworth and Churchill in the space of a few sentences is doubtless
unlikely to get belly laughs; but the theatrical appeal of he who quotes -
British consular official Henry Carr, confusedly reminiscing about Joyce,
Lenin and Tristan Tzara in the Zurich of the Great War - is large enough to
carry away any audience.
As played by Antony Sher with a perfect feeling for the character's
magnificent vague magniloquence, his old man's disinclination to tie up a
sentence or stick to a fact, his sheer joy at swimming in cliche, Carr is an
irresistibly naughty old blunderer, grinning with vivid schadenfreude as he
holds on to one fact, at least: that Joyce is dead while he himself isn't.
And he's not just an old blunderer, but a young one too; for he must slip
continually between his dusty anecdotage and his dapper heyday, a feat Sher
performs with easy brilliance.
In his younger incarnation Carr, along with most of the other characters, is
presented in terms of his role in an actual production by Joyce's English
Players of The Importance of Being Earnest. This rendering of Joyce through
the framework of Wilde is a marvellous basic image for the play, which not
only offers actors acting real-life people acting (Carr, too, is based on
fact), but with its stopping and starting and repeated versions of the same
scene nicely dramatises the very act of remembering.
To angle the historical drama through insignificant Carr's eye is Stoppard's
most poignant and Joycean invention. Great art may perfectly well be a
'celebration of nonentities', or of tyrants, Joyce informs the Dada-ist poet
Tzara (the spiffy David Westhead). A pity that, as Alastair Macaulay found,
reviewing the production's Barbican opening on this page last September,
Lloyd Hutchinson isn't commanding enough as Joyce. He looks right, but lacks
the true top o' the morning brio.
The tyrant Lenin fits more problematically into Stoppard's scheme, but even
he - in this recension of the published text - has the Wildeanism of: 'To
lose one revolution is a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness.'
Geoffrey Freshwater - a fine portrayal of uncanny physical likeness - cracks
that one from a high orator's platform cleverly cut into the backdrop by
designer Richard Hudson.
Amanda Harris, Rebecca Saire and Trevor Martin as Wildean women-folk and
manservant give immaculate support. Adrian Noble's staging - which fits its
new home pretty snugly - is intelligent, vigorous and sometimes touching.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Ionesco, master of tragic farces - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial playwright Eugene Ionesco, master of the Theatre of the
Absurd, died yesterday in Paris at the age of 81.
His work was characterised by a blend of black humour and farce which he
used to caricature the conventions of middle class family life and explore a
wider philosophical anguish at the intrinsic loneliness of man.
His most celebrated play, The Bald Soprano, in which two couples exchange
banalities, was inspired by his experience of learning English - many of the
phrases, such as 'the ceiling is up, the floor is down', were taken directly
from his grammar books. The play opened to catcalls in 1950 but has since
been performed more than 25,000 times.
Born in Slatina, Romania, on November 26, 1912, the son of a Romanian lawyer
and a French mother, Ionesco spent his early years in Paris. French became
his first language before he returned to complete his studies in Bucharest.
He wrote poems, dabbled in literary criticism and became a high school
teacher in France before writing his first play, The Bald Soprano, in 1948.
At the premiere of his next play, The Lesson, in which a professor spends an
hour verbally assaulting a pupil, the leading actor had to flee the theatre
through a back door while an outraged audience clamoured to demand its money
back.
The bizarre slapstick of his work has left its legacy in contemporary comedy
as well as drama. But behind the studied absurdity, there was a serious
intent. Ionesco was a longtime foe of political tyranny, particularly of the
regime of Nicolae Ceaucescu, and his work conveyed what he viewed as man's
struggle to survive in a society that formed barriers between human beings.
The Chairs (1951) was a bleaker statement about man's inability to share
experience. Two elderly people living in a lonely tower on an island wait
for their guests to arrive to hear the message that the old man wants to
leave for posterity. Since he cannot express it himself, he has hired an
orator. Empty chairs accumulate on stage, crowding out the couple who
finally jump to their death. Ionesco described his plays as 'comic dramas'
or 'tragic farces' because he viewed both elements as inextricably linked.
In The New Tenant, (1954) furniture mushrooms to the point where the whole
flat, street and city and even the Seine river are clogged with furniture.
Other successful works included Victims of Duty (1954) and The Killer
(1957).
His international stature was confirmed with Rhinoceros (1959), a play in
which everyone but the play's two main protagonists turns into aggressive
pachyderms. The work, which made its Paris premiere with Jean-Louis Barrault
directing and acting, was seen as the playwright's response to the rise of
Fascism in pre-war Romania.
'When people no longer share your opinions, when you can no longer make
yourself understood by them, you have the impression of being confronted
with monsters - rhinos, for example,' Ionesco told Le Monde. 'They have that
mixture of candour and ferocity. They would kill you with the best of
consciences.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Firms decide against merging
operations - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Against the expectation of the legal services market, the Norton Rose/M5
group of English law firms has decided not to merge its operations into a
single national partnership.
A review of the group's activities has concluded that there is at present no
business case for merging all seven firms into a national practice and the
present structure remains the one best suited to help group members deliver
the service their clients require. The group will therefore continue to
collaborate on professional development and support, including training,
recruitment and exchange of information and know-how and also in business
development, particularly by marketing the firms as a group overseas.
Mr Jonathan Barclay, a partner of Norwich solicitors Mills &amp; Reeve and
chairman of the group's board, said nine months ago he would not have
guessed this would have been the outcome of the review. But the more they
looked into the actual needs of clients, the clearer it became that there
was no significant advantage in merger.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Fight for right to clear names - The
Fayed brothers' case against the UK government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alone among Council of Europe countries, the UK denies its citizens an
effective remedy, if the state brands them as dishonest and criminal without
the right to a fair trial.
So say the Fayed brothers, owners of the House of Fraser stores group which
includes Harrods in London. Publicly condemned by the Department of Trade
and Industry inspectors' report into their 1985 takeover of the House of
Fraser for dishonestly misleading the authorities - a charge they have
always disputed - Messrs Mohamed, Ali and Salah Fayed claim they have been
denied the right to clear their names.
They have taken their fight to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg. Their case is that the denial of effective access to a domestic
court to defend their right to honour and reputation and the denial of
effective domestic remedies to challenge the DTI inspectors' findings amount
to a breach of articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Last week's oral hearing followed the rejection last summer of the Fayeds'
case by the European Commission of Human Rights. The court's judgment is not
expected until the autumn.
Victory for the Fayeds might not only force the UK government to change the
procedures of company investigations and tribunals of inquiry, such as Lord
Justice Scott's current arms to Iraq inquiry. It could, in the words of Lord
Lester QC, the Fayeds' counsel, 'secure stronger national judicial
protection of individuals in the UK whose basic human rights and freedoms
are decisively affected by administrative actions'.
On the other hand, defeat, as Lord Lester told the Strasbourg judges, 'would
inevitably mean that in the UK, public authorities - including
government-appointed investigators and government itself - would be able
publicly to defame an individual with impunity; the victim would be
prevented from seeking any redress in national courts; and the convention
would be unable to protect him from a violation of his human rights'.
Mr Michael Cole, House of Fraser's director of public affairs, said that, by
taking their case to Strasbourg, the Fayeds were not seeking to hinder
public debate or hamper investigations into financial malpractice. Neither
were they asking the court to clear their names. They were simply seeking to
ensure that individuals accused of serious misconduct enjoyed due process of
law and that there were adequate safeguards in English law against the
misuse of public powers.
The case they advance is a powerful one. Lord Lester told the judges there
was no doubt the central conclusion of the DTI inspectors' report was that
the Fayeds were guilty of dishonest misrepresentation. In the eyes of the
world the report, published by the government, had the force of a judgment
delivered after a lengthy trial at which the Fayeds had been convicted. But
there had been no trial and criminal charges had never been brought. The
government had even decided not to seek to have the Fayeds disqualified as
company directors.
The Fayeds' civil right to a good reputation had been drastically and
decisively interfered with by the process, Lord Lester said. The procedures
governing DTI company investigations afforded no safeguards for the rights
of those under investigation.
Hearings are held in private. Inspectors are free to decide how they conduct
their inquiries. They do not have to inform those under investigation of the
identity of witnesses against them. Those under investigation have no right
to confront or cross-examine witnesses and no right to see the evidence
against them. Inspectors can rely on evidence that would be inadmissible in
a court. And the secretary of state has a broad discretion to publish a
report.
Lord Lester said this 'unfair' system of company investigations had been
heavily criticised in recent years - most recently in a debate in the House
of Lords in February. It carried a disproportionate risk of unnecessary harm
to individuals. Measures were needed to minimise that harm, either by
introducing greater procedural safeguards such as the right to cross-examine
witnesses, or by providing real and effective access to the courts to
challenge the inspectors' findings.
Lord Lester said the Fayeds had no effective remedy of any kind against
publication of a condemnatory report and the damage it caused. A libel
action against the secretary of state or the inspectors would have been
struck out on the grounds that what they had published was privileged. An
action based on a separate libel against the Observer newspaper, for
articles written about the Fayeds in connection with the House of Fraser
takeover, was not an effective remedy against publication by the government.
And English judicial review was too restrictive to provide any redress.
The government's response, put by Mr Michael Baker QC, was equally robust.
It said that company investigations were not designed to determine whether
individuals were entitled to the reputations they enjoyed. Company
investigations were not trials; their purpose was to ascertain the facts
about a company's affairs and report them to the secretary of state.
Any damage to the Fayeds' reputations was an incidental consequence. They
themselves were largely responsible for any harm caused, both by the manner
in which they conducted themselves and in the substance of their evidence to
the inspectors.
Mr Baker said that, in essence, the Fayeds were arguing for a full right of
appeal against inspectors' reports, although they could have used judicial
review to challenge any perverse or arbitrary decision of the inspectors or
the secretary of state.
If they felt the inspectors had been biased, or had misled them or their
advisers, or had reached conclusions unsupported by the facts - all
allegations that the Fayeds had made on the day after publication of the
report - they could have sought a judicial review. But they did not. They
also failed to seek a judicial review of the secretary of state's decision
to publish the report. By not doing this and by failing to pursue the
Observer, they had not exhausted their domestic remedies, as required by the
convention.
In spite of the rejection last year of the Fayeds' case by the European
Commission of Human Rights, Lord Lester remains optimistic. The commission
was often overturned by the full court, he said yesterday.
The court's reception of his submission of evidence showing that the UK
alone among Council of Europe countries fails to provide an effective remedy
to those under investigation for alleged financial or commercial malpractice
gave him most confidence.
In Germany, for example, publication of such a report would be illegal if
the authorities had not also indicted the individuals concerned. In Sweden,
Switzerland and the Netherlands, no administrative body has the power to
publish a report imputing serious criminal misconduct to named individuals.
Even in the US, where freedom of speech is jealously guarded, an inspectors'
report could not have been published by the government if the individuals
concerned had not had the right to know the evidence on which the findings
were based or to confront and cross-examine witnesses.
The UK government appeared to have no answer to this evidence. Mr Baker
argued that what happened in other countries was of little value to a case
involving the UK. But, said Lord Lester, the court did not seem impressed
with that line of reasoning. If he is right, the House of Fraser saga may
yet be the unlikely vehicle for an improvement in human rights in the UK.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Schindler's lottery can be banned -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National legislation prohibiting the operation of lotteries within a member
state's own territory is lawful under EC law, even though such action
constitutes a barrier to the freedom to provide services, the European Court
of Justice ruled last week.
The case concerned the sale of German lottery tickets in the UK. The
Schindler brothers were agents for the lottery and sent 20,000 order forms
to individuals in the UK. The documents were confiscated by Customs under UK
laws that ban lotteries in the UK and prohibit the importation of any
publicity material about the running of lotteries.
In the High Court, the Schindlers claimed the UK law was incompatible with
the Rome treaty rules on free movement of goods and freedom to provide
services. The court referred the matter to the ECJ. Eight other member
states also intervened in the proceedings.
The ECJ first had to decide how lottery activities should be treated as a
matter of EC law. The Belgian, German, Irish, Luxembourg and Portuguese
governments argued that such activities were outside the scope of the
treaty, as they did not constitute economic activities.
The Spanish, French and UK governments, together with the European
Commission, argued that such activities were services rather than goods and
should be dealt with under the services rules. The Schindlers submitted the
activities were covered by the EC provisions on free movement of goods.
The Court ruled the activities were economic activities and fell within the
scope of the treaty. It also found that, although physical objects were
distributed, they were merely part and parcel of the organisation and
functioning of a lottery which could not be regarded as goods.
Such activities should be treated as services. The services concerned were
those supplied by the lottery organiser in causing individuals who had
bought tickets to participate in a game of chance and offering them the hope
of winning.
Despite the entertaining nature of lotteries, they were clearly
profit-making organisations. Even where certain member states' laws only
allowed the profits of lotteries to be used for purposes in the public
interest, such as support of the arts, this did not rob the activities of
their economic nature.
The Court then had to decide whether the UK rules were a barrier to the
freedom to provide services. Only the Belgian and Luxembourg governments
argued that the provisions did not constitute such a barrier, on the ground
they were applicable to both the providers of the services in the UK as well
as in other European Union countries.
The court reiterated its earlier position on the issue. National measures
which were indistinctly applicable were capable of falling within the scope
of the EC services rules, if the measures were such as to prohibit or
otherwise impede the activities of a provider of services established in
another member state where that person lawfully provided similar services.
As that was the position in the present case, the Court ruled that the
national provisions did constitute a barrier to the freedom to provide
services.
The final issue to be decided by the Court in the light of earlier findings
was whether such a restriction, which was found not to be discriminatory,
could be justified on public policy grounds.
All the member states agreed and argued that such restrictions were
compatible with the EC services rules on the grounds that they were
justified as being in the public interest. The Commission submitted that the
restrictions were unlawful because they were disproportionate.
The Court found that the aims of the UK measures were to protect the users
of the service as well as consumers generally and the social order. The
Court had already held in previous cases that such aims justified
restrictions on the freedom to provide services. Member states were thus
entitled to take measures such as those at issue, so long as they were not
discriminatory.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Sadler (above), 63, former deputy chairman of the John Lewis
Partnership, is to be the next chairman of the Pearl Group, the UK life
insurer which was bought by Australian insurance giant AMP in late 1989 for
Pounds 1.2bn.
He takes over in May when the present chairman Eric Lyall retires on his
70th birthday. Sadler, who began his career as a civil servant, is already
chairman of the UK board of AMP and London Life, another member of the AMP
Group. Pearl, which ranks among the top ten UK life companies, has over
Pounds 10bn of assets under management and 10,000 staff.
Sadler is a member of the board of IMRO, a trustee of the BT Pension Scheme,
and was a member of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from 1973 to 1985.
He also looked at the issue of cross-media promotion for the DTI, but his
recommendation that there should be a code of practice to cover how media
companies promote their other business interests has yet to be implemented.

Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allen Sykes, a former finance director of insurance brokers Willis Corroon,
has been appointed chairman of Economic Insurance, which was the subject of
a Pounds 11.5m management buy-out at the end of last year.
Sykes, 62, is probably best known as the joint author with AJ Merrett of one
of the standard works on project finance, The finance and analysis of
capital projects which was first published in 1963. He joined Unilever as a
management trainee in 1955, and has worked for RTZ, Willis Faber and
Consolidated Gold Fields, where he was a managing director at the time of
its 1989 takeover by Hanson.
The management of Economic Insurance bought the company from Hafnia, the
Danish insurer, with the backing of Candover Investments and Causeway
Capital. It specialises in providing 'own label' insurance products for a
number of insurance brokers as well as marketing policies under its own
name. Sykes replaces John Sclater, 53, chairman of Hill Samuel and Foreign
and Colonial Investment Trust, who had been chairman since 1992.
Economic's new management team has sharply reduced the number of products
offered and has transformed the company's financial fortunes. Having
reported a net loss of Pounds 5.2m on gross premiums of Pounds 39.5m in
1992, it made a net profit of Pounds 4m on premiums of Pounds 41.7m in the
year to end-December 1993.
The company, which hopes to get a stockmarket quote within the next two to
three years, expects to add another non-executive director to its board.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Technology: German sites for Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies are continuing to locate more new research, design and
development (RD&amp;D) centres in Germany than in any other European country, in
spite of its current economic problems. Spain became the second favourite
site for new facilities last year, with the UK dropping to third equal with
the Netherlands.
Britain still has the largest number of established Japanese RD&amp;D centres -
83 out of the European total of 264 - but Germany, with 53, is slowly
narrowing the gap: until 1992 Britain had almost twice as many. France, with
34, remains in third place, but Spain, now with 26, is catching up rapidly.
These trends emerge from the latest annual survey of Japanese manufacturing
companies' European operations, recently published by the Japanese External
Trade Organisation (Jetro). It shows that there was a further slowdown in
the rate of new RD&amp;D centres across Europe last year. After a doubling in
1990, and rises of 48 per cent in 1991, and 20 per cent in 1992, only 24
facilities were opened last year, a rise of 10 per cent.
The Jetro survey is not definitive: only about 61 per cent of the 728
Japanese manufacturers in Europe replied to it. But it does suggest the
beginnings of a new trend: a small decline last year in the number of RD&amp;D
units not linked to a Japanese company's European manufacturing operations.
For the first time the number of such stand-alone units fell from 67 to 65.
Several European governments have been pressing Japanese companies to
establish integrated RD&amp;D facilities, rather than stand-alone units which
feed all their work to operations in Japan.
On the other hand - surprisingly in view of the strong yen - the proportion
of companies with a 50 per cent plus ratio of local parts and materials
content in their European manufacturer eased slightly in 1993, from 76 per
cent to just under 74 per cent.

Australian Peter Thomas, 61, an executive director of Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, has finally decided to retire back to
Australia and says that he will not be making any comebacks.
Thomas, P&amp;O's head of corporate affairs, is one of the few senior P&amp;O
executives who joined Britain's biggest shipping company long before it was
transformed by Lord Sterling's arrival in 1982. A former editor of the
Birmingham Sketch, Thomas first joined P&amp;O in 1960, went back to Australia
in 1967 with Overseas Containers Australia, before returning to P&amp;O. He then
spent several years with Smiths Industries before returning to P&amp;O for a
third time in 1980. After seven years on the P&amp;O board, he retires in April
but will retain his links with the group by joining P&amp;O Australia in Sydney.

At the end of this month Peter Batchelor, one of the best-known figures on
the UK car market scene, will be ending a 40-year career with General Motors
at the age of 56. When he first joined GM as an apprentice at its AC Delco
parts division at Dunstable, Vauxhall was producing pseudo-American cars
like the Velox.
He joined Vauxhall itself in 1982 and few see it as coincidence that since
then Vauxhall's UK market share has doubled, to the point where it is
treading hard on the heels of market leader Ford.
His current post of vice-chairman, commercial operations at Vauxhall will
depart with him. It was created last year specifically in order to help
Batchelor oversee an orderly transition to a new regime which will be in
place from April.
Under this, Ian Coomber, who stepped into Batchelor's shoes last year as
sales and marketing director, and Jim Raymond, after-sales director, will
report directly to Vauxhall's chairman and managing director, Charles
Golden.
Although he has just become eligible to play in the British Seniors (golf)
Championships, he will make time to remain as motor industry representative
on the government's National Board of Crime Prevention.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Technology: File for patents far and wide - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent agreement in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt (general agreement on
tariffs and trade) negotiations will have an obvious, positive impact on
trade in goods and services. Less clear is the profound effect it will have
on intellectual property rights (IPR) and corporate patenting strategies.
IPR is likely to change considerably over the next 10 years. Companies that
depend on IPR for their business should be filing now for patents in
countries that they want to start selling to in the next decade. Otherwise,
their future products will have no patent protection in these large emerging
markets.
IPR will now come under the umbrella of the Gatt (and its successor),
pressuring the developing world into creating IPR protection comparable to
that today in the countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). For many products, patent protection is
essential to creating or capturing future value, irrespective of whether the
product is imported, manufactured locally under licence, or manufactured by
a local subsidiary.
Goods and services now produced under licence, mainly in the OECD countries,
are estimated at more than Dollars 500bn (Pounds 342.40bn) a year. The total
value of goods and services covered by IPR protection is many times larger
and these amounts could easily double in real terms over the next 10 years
as the developing countries, particularly in Asia, join the market in IPR.
Under the Uruguay Round accord there will be a comprehensive and binding
agreement on IPR. This includes:
Broad cover for all forms of intellectual property in line with currently
accepted international standards, including the Paris Convention (patents)
and Berne Convention (copyright);
Twenty-year minimum patent life from filing date for products and processes;
Comprehensive enforcement procedures and dispute settlement mechanisms
within Gatt;
Protection for commercial and trade secrets when required by governments for
use in patent applications or for regulatory approvals.
OECD countries will have a one-year transition and mid-level developing
countries a further four years.
The least developed countries can have up to 11 years in transition but
patent applications can be made immediately for pharmaceutical and
agricultural chemical products, with patents granted at the end of the
transition period. Under the pressures of the trade sanctions that the Gatt
can deploy, enforceable patent systems are likely to emerge in a number of
less developed countries over the next 10 years.
We are seeing today a rapid shift in economic growth from the developed
world to the developing world. One view of future growth prospects suggests
that world GDP may increase from Dollars 24,000bn in 1990 to Dollars
51,000bn in 2010.
A patent filing programme covering the main OECD countries, with a lifetime
cost of about Dollars 270,000 (for a single, moderately complex technology)
will today cover around 54 per cent of world GDP. By 2010, that same
programme would be covering only 38 per cent of world GDP. Yet, by 2010,
there are likely to be enforceable IPR laws in the bulk of the remaining 62
per cent.
Responding to the imminent changes in the global IPR system may seem a
postponable decision, but country analyses of future GDP suggest that patent
filing programmes should include more Far Eastern and Latin American
countries. Relatively small changes in patent-filing programmes, at quite
low cost, could effect the success of technology-based companies in 10
years' time.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Technology: Thrills on the modern stage - A look at
developments in special effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theatre has come a long way since someone flicked a light switch on and off
to create the impression of lightning. Audiences these days want to be
thrilled by special effects, and at times these can become the star of the
show.
Everyone who saw the Phantom of the Opera remembers the falling chandelier,
and those who saw Miss Saigon remember the helicopter.
On the modern stage, characters appear from nowhere, and vanish suddenly.
Boats sail on-stage, war scenes are lit by sparks and flames, and fog
envelopes the scenery.
'We have to compete with other forms of entertainment like films, television
and amusement parks,' says Steven Terry, executive vice-president of the New
York special effects group Production Arts Lighting. 'You can do almost
anything on film these days, and audiences are demanding more and more
excitement. Since theatre tickets often cost Dollars 60 (Pounds 40) a head,
you have to provide something special if you want to stay in the game.'
Computerisation of lighting and scenery has provided much of the impetus for
greater use of special effects. Dozens of stage hands were once needed to
shift scenery and operate lights. With the help of a computer, one person
can easily control up to 1,000 fixed lights - not uncommon in big
productions - plus a series of moving lights.
The same computer can also control complex scenery movements: a trap door
opens here, a car swings on to the stage there. It usually does this by
sending signals to robot-like machines which shift the stage pieces around,
or automatically activate switches.
'The new sophistication comes largely from the extent to which special
effects are used,' says John Paull, technical production manager for the
Phantom of the Opera in New York. Complex scenery shifts such as the
intricate use of screens in Miss Saigon, Paull explains, would be impossible
without computer automation.
'With humans operating scenery movements, the pieces are more likely to
crash into each other or happen at the wrong time. Now we use a closed-loop
system with constant feedback through the computer. Everything is
pre-programmed so that errors are very rare. The computer knows where
everything is.'
The new dependence on computers is also driven by the high cost of labour in
the heavily unionised theatre industry. 'The old rule was one man, one set
of lights,' says Terry. 'Now, one man can operate thousands of switches, and
that makes it all a lot cheaper.'
Other advances are contributing to the special effects craze. Stage managers
have been making much use, for instance, of a new way of producing
theatrical fog. Glycol-based fog, produced by vaporising and cooling mineral
oil, has largely replaced dry ice, which is just as effective but more
expensive.
New machines chill a mineral oil and water mixture, and the cold temperature
causes the resulting smoke to lie low on the stage. The new machines have
become so popular, it is the rare Broadway production that does not have at
least one fog scene.
Some actors have complained about the effects of glycol fog on their health.
'We are very concerned about complaints about everything from respiratory
problems to headaches because of the new fog,' says Helaine Feldman, of the
Actors' Equity Association, the actors' union of New York. It is conducting
a survey of the health effects of glycol and may press managers to cut down
on its use.
Laser lights have so far mostly been confined to rock shows, but some
designers see lasers as a way of producing fresh-looking lighting effects,
and believe their use may increase. 'Lasers used as an alternative type of
light source can enhance certain effects,' says Gregory Meeh, president of
US special effects company Jauchem &amp; Meeh.
Scenery movements have also been aided by greater use of infra-red remote
controls. 'We used to use radio frequencies, but those can go through
walls,' explains Paull, who used infra-red to control a boat in Phantom of
the Opera. 'We had some problems with interference. It kind of takes away
from the production if the scenery starts heading into the audience.'
Pyrotechnics - the explosion of fire crackers and fireworks or the use of
flames on the stage - produce a dramatic effect, but still depend mainly on
traditional methods. One innovation, though, is a mushroom spore called
lacapodium, which when aerated and combined with an electric spark,
resembles a flame.
For many designers, the technology of the future is projection. 'I think
we'll see more integration of film with live characters,' predicts Jeremiah
Harris, production supervisor and president of Harris Production services.
Film projectors are now capable of packing in large numbers of frames per
second. Many are able to handle 72 frames per second, a speed which can
accommodate a very bright light source behind the image. With a stronger
image, designers can use projection to create life-like scenic backdrops.
'You can get much bigger visual images this way,' says Harris. A wooded
scene, for instance, could be played against a backdrop film of a forest,
with flying birds and swinging branches.
Some people in the industry worry that the spectacle detracts from the
traditional enjoyment of the actors' craft. In the worst case, they argue,
special effects may serve as a substitute for good writing and acting.
However, Paull says that special effects cannot turn weak drama into
success. 'The best combination is strong theatre with strong special
effects. You need to have something more than scenery movements and lights
to draw people in night after night.'

director of Ryman, the stationery chain of the Pentos group.
Last week Paul Hogarth was switched from his post as operations director at
Ryman to take up the same post with Dillons, the bookstore chain of the
group, and Frank Brazier - formerly chief executive at Dillons - abruptly
departed the troubled group.
Belfield's move from consultancy to hands-on management does not come

FT  29 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Hands on, hands off -
Richard Gourlay debates the merits for companies of a specialist approach to
venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For UK managers blessed with a head office that decides to sell them the
subsidiary they work for, choosing a venture capital company is one of the
most important decisions to take.
Pricing is obviously a consideration, in terms of the cost of finance and
the amount of equity the management must give up to raise the necessary
capital.
Differentiating further between venture capital companies can be difficult.
Many talk of the way they develop 'personal chemistry' with entrepreneurs.
And they all stress how important it is to develop common investment goals -
such as agreeing on how long investors might expect to wait before seeking
an exit route.
In an effort to stand out from the crowd, some UK venture capital suppliers,
notably Apax Partners, have long tried to present themselves as specialists
in particular industry sectors. Rather than being financial experts who know
about structuring deals and who subsequently get to know the industry in
which they invest, these 'specialists' reverse the approach.
Apax, Advent, Trinity and Baronsmead all hire individuals whose industry
expertise is used to tempt investee companies as much, if not more, than
their ability to structure deals.
But do the companies choosing these specialists get what they expect? And do
budding management teams appreciate that the non-executive directors who are
invariably appointed represent the interests of the venture capitalist?
Four years ago Linda Wilkinson, was looking for a venture capital company to
finance the buy-out of Midland Network Services, a telecommunications
network company now called Imminus where she is chairman and managing
director, from the Midland Bank Group.
There was much international interest initially in the company, based in
Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, which had carved out a niche providing travel
agents with direct data links to tour operators. But the potential buyers
dropped away when they realised the incumbent management was putting
together its own bid. Any outside buyer would have been dependent on the
thwarted management to move the company's clients from its Midland's network
to a new network.
With profits of more than Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 8m, there was no
shortage of potential backers. Imminus chose Apax. 'They have a specific
interest and knowledge in this sector,' says Wilkinson. 'If we were going to
bring others in we wanted investors who were going to make a valid
contribution and not just give us the money.'
Apax offered industry expertise through John McMonigall, a former managing
director of operations at British Telecommunications's communication systems
division. He joined the Imminus board as non-executive director. Wilkinson
says the association with Apax and McMonigall gave Imminus stature in its
market.
But she says the company is yet to receive the full degree of
industry-specific input promised at the outset. Wilkinson and her management
team are ready to consider strategic moves for the company, but are not
clear how Apax's general industry knowledge can be translated into specific
help. She recognises, however, that it is still early days. 'As yet we have
not had the opportunity to test if we will actually get that.'
Wilkinson says Imminus may require additional specialist help from
independent consultants. This, she says, would inevitably lead to a more
distant relationship with Apax. 'We all specifically agreed we needed to
focus and had a busy agenda to complete,' she says. 'The acid test will
really be over the next two to three months whether or not they (Apax) make
an input that is of value.'
McMonigall agrees that now Imminus has transferred clients to its own
network, Apax must offer specific strategic input. 'In a sense, apart from
monthly board meetings, I have done little else,' he says. 'In April we will
do away-days off-site and work at answering the strategic questions.' This
is typical of his relationship with the other Apax investments, he says. The
time devoted to each investment varies greatly between companies and depends
on what stage they are at.
Some venture-backed companies, however, believe the benefits of
specialisation are exaggerated. Many argue that specialist knowledge is
quickly out of date once the 'specialist' has left his or her industry.
Others say the last thing managers want after escaping the clutches of a
large group is further interference from a shareholder who is
second-guessing the management team.
Many would agree, though, that the specialist knowledge is of great benefit
in the early stages, helping the venture capitalist avoid deals which
involve undue risk from the management, the product or its market.
Stuart Evans, managing director of Cotag International, a maker of
electronic security systems, chose not to seek specialist backers. The
Cambridge-based company has been backed by ECI Ventures with three tranches
of capital since 1984.
'For most companies it is not generally the case that you want specific
industry experience,' he says. 'The experience you want, which is scarce, is
people and personnel skills. For little companies the risk typically comes
from restructuring. It is helpful if a (non-executive) is someone you can go
to with senior personnel issues.'
Evans says that the venture capital supplier which is prepared to provide
second tranches of capital is more important than one offering industry
expertise.
Other venture capital suppliers agree. Paul Brooks, managing director of
Prudential Venture Managers, says: 'In my experience people want a venture
capitalist who understands the industry but who has not necessarily worked
in the industry - they want a balance between knowledge and interference.
Companies have to have a clear view about the construction of their board -
if you want expertise then buy it in the market place.'
This view is shared by Jonathan Baker, director of ECI Ventures. 'We would
not pretend to add value by second-guessing management on industry trends
but by changing management methods and controls and giving strategic input,'
he says.
Specialist industry expertise may help the venture capitalist avoid poor
investments and make a more informed evaluation of new deals but the company
seeking finance should remember that a venture capitalist's main focus is to
find and win good deals and avoid bad ones, a quest which will not always
allow it the time to nurture existing investments.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Big savings in the
details - Cost cutters are seeking to trim in the least obvious areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have cut staffing levels by so much that further surgery would impair
the company's ability to function. Yet more fat must be trimmed if margin
improvement and growth is to be maintained while sales are static.
Alternatively, you are planning the sale of a company at a price, for
instance, of 10 times earnings. Every Pounds 50,000 cost-saving would lead
to a Pounds 500,000 increase in the price the company would fetch.
As the areas in which savings can be made become less obvious, so companies
are increasingly turning to specialist cost cutters. Not only does this
allow the managers to focus on those core areas of business development
where they can add most value, but consultants can also frequently do a
better job of finding savings for the very reason that it is what they do
all the time.
Turning to specialists is not new. UK consultants, such as National Utility
Services, help companies find ways to control the cost of items like
electricity, gas and water bills. And groups like Proudfoot design and
implement cost-cutting programmes, often aimed at finding productivity
increases which involve a cut in the workforce.
But businesses can now get help in cutting costs, particularly overheads, in
parts of their businesses where savings may previously have been seen as too
small to bother with.
Importing an idea that has taken off in the US, one London-based company,
Expense Reduction Analysts, offers to scrutinise the least obvious areas
within a business to find savings which nevertheless drop straight to the
bottom line.
The office stationery supplies, courier services and printing bills are
prime targets. 'The amounts we are looking at are not significant in terms
of the sales of any company.
'What we do is look to see what a company of that size should be paying for
its services,' says Frederick Marfleet, the executive director of ERA.
Stephen Dunsdon-Mash, chairman of ERA, says he has saved one company with
sales of Pounds 300m more than Pounds 1m by reducing the amount of material
delivered by unnecessary overnight delivery services. Many companies with
sales of more than Pounds 100m will still be buying their stationery from
catalogues, a notoriously expensive source of supply.
Per Troen, a partner in a small international law firm, Abbott, King and
Troen, said some of the areas ERA identified did not yield savings. But
other recommendations saved the firm 10-15 per cent on its annual
stationery, postage and courier bills.
When senior managers bring in outside consultants to look at costs they can
create serious tensions. For this reason, Dunsdon-Mash makes his first
approach to the board level of companies, over the heads of those implicitly
criticised if savings are found - the purchasing managers.
The ERA service is provided purely on a contingency basis. ERA's low
overheads allow it to charge only if it realises savings for its clients, as
is the case for companies offering the service in the US. 'For us to be able
to find Pounds 10,000 in savings is zero risk to the company,' says
Dunsdon-Mash.
If it does identify savings, its fees are steep - 50 per cent of the savings
in the first year. ERA returns to the company three months after making
recommendations to re-audit its position. Clients then have a contractual
obligation to share any savings in the first year.
For companies seeking immediate reductions in costs the idea has obvious
attractions. But it can also accelerate the trend towards companies shedding
what BET calls the 'chore businesses' and focusing on the core areas where
they have a distinctive competence.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banks' reference system
to change - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses seeking bank credit references on potential or existing clients
must prepare to change their ways.
For decades banks have played their part in the provision of 'one bank and
two trade references' which have been the sum total of many companies'
credit management systems.
But from yesterday, the clearing banks require suppliers to approach their
customers' banks for a reference. Until now suppliers have approached their
own banks who in turn went to the customers' banks for the reference.
The change has a number of implications. Banks supply some customers with
the reference service free of charge but the new references will cost the
supplier at least Pounds 8.
More importantly, it could damage relations with potential customers. Before
giving a reference the customer's bank will need its client's permission
which in turn means the supplier will need to seek permission for that
reference. Some suppliers may find this awkward in the middle of a sales
pitch.
Companies may decide a more comprehensive service is available from the
specialised credit information suppliers for very little extra cost.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Gatwick Express makes surprise early profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gatwick Express, the first British Rail service set for privatisation,
carried more passengers than planned and made an unexpected profit in its
first few months as an independent business.
Mr Robert Mason, managing director, said the company, which runs non-stop
trains between Gatwick Airport and London Victoria, had expected to break
even, but better-than-expected passenger numbers boosted ticket revenues by
Pounds 2m.
Ticket revenues rose to Pounds 27m in the past 12 months with Gatwick
Express operating as an independent 'shadow franchise' in the last six. The
company had budgeted for ticket revenues of Pounds 25m.
The management team plans to renew its entire train fleet at a cost of about
Pounds 45m if it is successful in staging a buy-out.
Gatwick Express's present locomotives are 28 years old and its coaches are
19 years old. It operates seven trains providing 134 daily services, but
plans to buy eight sets of locomotives and coaches to allow for maintenance.
Mr Mason said the company was 'very happy' with its Pounds 8m contract with
Railtrack, the state-owned company set up to run BR's track and signalling
after privatisation. This guarantees access to the track between Gatwick and
London and to two reserved platforms at Gatwick. Managers in other British
Rail divisions have complained that Railtrack's track charges are too high.
Gatwick Express's one concern is that Railtrack should not allow Victoria
station to be turned into a shopping mall, so marginalising train
operations.
Gatwick Express has acquired the lease to run Gatwick Airport station. As
station operator it must treat all train companies using the station
equally. This means it will reduce promotional advertising for its services
at Gatwick and create a single ticket office for its own services and those
of its two rivals, Network SouthEast and Thameslink.
Gatwick Express plans improvements to its services to attract more
passengers, including a coach service from Victoria for travellers staying
in London hotels and an improved setting-down area for travellers arriving
by car.
It has also been marketing its service to the airlines serving Gatwick and
to tour operators. It wants airlines to sell train tickets on aircraft and
tour operators to include a train ticket in package holidays.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Listening in to a divided community: The BBC in Ulster faces
the task of maintaining fairness and balance where bad judgment can have
serious consequences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A phone-in argument over coloured icing on an anniversary cake might not
appear to be the stuff of serious radio broadcasting. But in Northern
Ireland the BBC knows only too well that trivia can be deadly serious.
With a few minutes left of his popular Talk Back programme, presenter Mr
David Dunseith is up to his headphones in controversy. A televised report of
a party thrown for Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic
and Labour party, has shown the cake apparently iced in the Irish Republic's
colours.
A member of the province's grievously divided community is not amused and
sounds off on air. Before long, Mr Mark Durkan, chairman of the SDLP, is on
the line to stress that any likeness is unintentional: the SDLP has never
used or abused any nation's national flag.
In this part of the United Kingdom sensitivities are as acute as political
opinions are diverse. Extremes tend to dominate and it often appears that
only those who shout loudest get heard.
In the middle stands BBC Northern Ireland, recent winner of a Royal
Television Society award for serving the province and charged under charter
with providing a daily menu of public service broadcasting. One of its prime
tasks is to maintain fairness and balance in a society where bad judgment
can have potentially grave consequences.
'There is an obvious difficulty in being called the British Broadcasting
Corporation in a place like this,' said Mr Robin Walsh, the affable but
tough Londonderry-born controller of BBC Northern Ireland. 'One side of the
community thinks you should be waving a particular flag. The other suspects
you are part of the establishment and not to be trusted.'
Mr Walsh's assessment is easily confirmed. At the recent annual conference
of Sinn Fein, the BBC was vilified for peddling 'loyalist propaganda'. On
the other hand, Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionists,
claims many ordinary working-class Protestants believe even the surnames of
some local BBC broadcasters lend weight to suspicions of pro-Catholic bias.
He also thinks, along with BBC Ulster newsroom 'old boy' Mr Martyn Lewis,
that there is 'too much bad news'. A senior RUC man puts it differently: 'I
sometimes wonder if there is just too much news broadcasting here
altogether. Constant regurgitation is not helpful.'
Mr Walsh stresses the corporation's commitment to cover all aspects of life
in the province, but believes the thirst for news in Ulster is unquenchable.
He accepts, however, that there is a tendency to inflate or overstate its
impact and that hyperbole can get the better of any journalist.
But he rejects the old notion 'that if everybody moans you must be getting
it about right. I think that is trite. If you scratch the surface of the
rhetoric I think you find most people believe we are trying to be fair in a
tough situation.'
Mr Durkan of the SDLP accepts the point, recognising that 'in the cut and
thrust of daily deadlines things are not always going to be calibrated too
precisely'.
'The thing I am most proud of, 'said Mr Walsh, 'is the manner in which
people at the sharp end of highly emotive stories manage to leave their
tribal and political affiliations at home.'
There is plenty of extra guidance on how to avoid the terminological traps
which await newcomers to Ulster politics. Never, say BBC guidelines, refer
to IRA 'volunteers' - who knows why they joined? - and avoid offending
everyone by referring to the 'mainland'.
Mr Walsh's journalists sometimes take much more serious risks: one reporter
endured a terrifying, isolated rendezvous with hooded men to hear stories
which Mr Walsh believes ultimately led to the Stevens inquiry into alleged
collusion between police and loyalist paramilitaries.
His staff have been caught in bomb blasts, borne the brunt of angry public
reaction to atrocities and occasionally faced direct intimidation from the
paramilitaries.
There is no shortage of recruits, however, to work in the BBC's only 24-hour
newsroom outside London. Against the trend, the BBC locally has invested to
beef up its specialist political and security teams.
The organisation faces tough competition in the local marketplace. Live at
Six on UTV, for example, mounts a highly effective effort to win early
evening news viewers and strives hard to inject a more intimate, Ulster
flavour into its coverage.
All broadcasters in the province share one common problem - the continuing
ban on broadcasting the words of representatives of Sinn Fein and extremist
paramilitary organisations. Mr Keith Baker, head of news and current
affairs, calls it a 'preposterous straitjacket' which creates particular
problems for live programmes.
But Mr Sam Beattie, chairman of the Police Federation in the province, is
angry that broadcasters such as the BBC employ actors to help thwart
legislation intended to keep people off the airwaves. He says their actions
are naive and help the terrorists' cause.
Mr Baker says of the daily editorial decisions which have to be made because
of the restrictions: 'We haven't got it wrong yet and I'm not sure what
would happen if we did: I suppose an angry phone call from the heritage
department.' The Talk Back lines are standing by.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Challenge to cables is given go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Families with young children yesterday won permission to launch an urgent
High Court challenge over the laying of underground electricity cables.
The parents, in north-east London, fear the cables could increase the risk
of childhood leukaemia and other cancers because of the anticipated
dangerous strength of the electromagnetic fields.
Three children - a young boy and two girls - acting through their fathers,
accused Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, of failing
properly to regulate the installation of cables to reinforce the north
London electricity grid.
Mr Graham Read, appearing for the families, said evidence showed that
leukaemia and other cancers in children might be linked with strong
electromagnetic fields.
Mr Justice Schiemann found there was an arguable case and indicated it
should be heard quickly. The cables are due to become 'live' this summer.
At the full hearing, the parents will seek orders obliging Mr Heseltine to
fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct that the electromagnetic
fields from the cables do not exceed safe levels.
Mr Heseltine was not represented in court yesterday.
National Grid plans to install six 275,000 volt electricity cables for six
miles in South Woodford, Walthamstow and Chingford.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Race bias complaints against police rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allegations of racial discrimination and serious assault against police
officers rose sharply last year, but the total of complaints of all kinds
fell, the Police Complaints Authority said yesterday.
The authority considered 17,991 complaints last year, a fall of 7 per cent
on the previous year. It allowed 17 per cent more complaints to be dropped
by police forces than in 1992 - 7,075 compared with 6,035. These included
allegations lodged for malicious or tactical reasons or where the
complainant chose not to co-operate with the inquiry.
The remaining 10,916 investigated complaints was 18 per cent down on 1992.
Complaints alleging corruption arose from 12 in 1992 to 17 last year.
The authority agreed to supervise 951 cases, up a quarter on 1992 and the
highest such total ever. That was thanks largely to the number of
allegations involving serious injury or death, which are required to be
supervised. Overall, forces referred 4,139 cases for possible supervision, 7
per cent down on 1992.
The number of complaints of racial discrimination rose from 67 in 1992 to
291. Disciplinary action was taken on 4 per cent of those complaints,
compared with 10 per cent of all investigated complaints.
Sir Leonard Peach, chairman of the complaints authority, said: 'This
substantial rise is due in part to more accurate recording and a greater
awareness of the complaints system, but there may be a greater unwillingness
to accept racially offensive behaviour.'
It was difficult, however, to substantiate the complaints to the required
level of proof - beyond reasonable doubt. 'Officers are unlikely to use
offensive language within the hearing of independent witnesses,' he said.
'It is frequently difficult to prove a complainant was specifically targeted
because of his or her ethnic origin.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Partnerships between local education authorities and Training and Enterprise
Councils form the bulk of the 13 pathfinders for the new-look Careers
Service.
The new organisations have been formed in 13 English regions to take over
the running of the service from local authorities.
The outlets, launched by the Department of Employment yesterday, promise
'greater innovation' in helping to find young people a job. Bids to run
services in other regions will be invited in May.
The government hoped when it invited competitive bids for the service that
private-sector training organisations might bid. However, in all but one
case the pathfinder services will be a partnership between Tecs, which
administer government-funded training programmes in England and Wales, and
local authorities. The service in Bedfordshire is the only one not formally
to involve its local Tec.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, denied yesterday that the new
organisations were a 'repackaging' of the previous service.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Sales of new cars expected to increase 6.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car sales in the UK are expected to rise by 6.8 per cent to 1.9m this
year, the latest forecast by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
says.
Sales jumped by 11.6 per cent last year to 1.78m after three years of steep
decline and in the first two months of 1994 have risen by 17.9 per cent
year-on-year.
UK motor industry leaders do not expect this pace to be maintained
throughout the year, however, and the SMMT warned that 'the forthcoming tax
increases and changes in company car taxation could inhibit growth'.
The SMMT's forecast is more cautious than some other recent predictions,
including one by Lombard Motor Finance, a subsidiary of National Westminster
Bank, which suggested that car sales could exceed 2m this year for the first
time since 1990.
The SMMT forecasts that new car sales will show only a modest rise in the
next two years with a further rise of 4.2 per cent to 1.98m in 1995.
The UK new car market is now into its second year of recovery - sales peaked
at 2.3m in 1989 but fell to only 1.59m in 1991 and 1992 - and is currently
the strongest of the large volume markets in western Europe.
UK new car production is forecast to rise 3.2 per cent to 1.42m this year
after an increase of 6.5 per cent in 1993, which was achieved despite the
sharp fall in new car sales in continental Europe, which undermined the
previous recovery in UK car exports.
UK car output is forecast to rise strongly again in 1995 with an increase of
7.4 per cent to 1.525m supported by the increase in production at car plants
operated by Honda and Toyota.
Demand for new commercial vehicles in the UK fell more steeply than for cars
during the recession, but the SMMT forecasts that sales will now pick up
significantly in 1994 and 1995. It forecasts that total commercial vehicle
sales will rise by 8 per cent this year to 212,900 and by a further 7.8 per
cent in 1995 to 229,400.
Production dropped steeply last year by 22.1 per cent to 196,900 under the
impact of the financial collapse of the former Daf commercial vehicle group
and the steep decline in light commercial vehicle sales in continental
Europe. The SMMT forecasts that overall UK commercial vehicle production
will rise by 8.3 per cent this year to 213,300 followed by a further
increase in 1995.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Binder partner sceptical of merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The managing partner of the Scottish arm of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's
eighth-largest accountancy firm, yesterday expressed scepticism over the
possibility of merging with Arthur Andersen, the fourth-largest.
Mr Ian Valentine said: 'The whole deal has got to be very carefully looked
at. I can see difficulties in the size, culture and nature of the regional
offices.'
His views reflected concerns expressed by several partners in the 11
regional practices that comprise Binder and which could jeopardise a merger
of the entire firm.
The comments came after it emerged over the weekend that Mr Jim Wadia,
managing partner for Arthur Andersen, wrote to Binder's senior partner two
weeks ago proposing a merger. The regional heads of the firm met last night
to learn fuller details of the proposals.
It also emerged yesterday that both the single Binder firm covering London
and Leeds, and the separate partnership for Manchester, were involved in the
discussions with Andersen. These two practices represent the bulk of the
firm's income and clients.
Senior partners within these two Binder's practices are believed to be keen
to press ahead with a merger.
Andersen is believed to be willing to accept even if none of the other
practices want to proceed. Full details of the merger are still subject to
discussion. However, it is unlikely that the deal would involve any payment.
Most discussion will concentrate on the terms on which partners in Binder
would be allocated 'units' or shares within the Andersen partnership.
Partners at Binder are now examining their deeds in detail to understand the
nature of the voting that would be necessary to approve any merger.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Outward investment falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies invested Pounds 8.7bn in overseas subsidiary and associated
companies in 1992 - slightly less than in 1991 - the most up-to-date figures
on overseas direct investment show.
The Netherlands, with Pounds 1.5bn, was the top location for UK investment
abroad in 1992, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. The
European Union accounted for 49 per cent of UK outward investment, up 8 per
cent from the previous year. North America took 14 per cent, half the value
in 1991.
The biggest rise in investment was in the rest of the world - mainly
developing countries - where it rose 19 per cent to account for 35 per cent.
The CSO said the position of the Netherlands as the most popular destination
was overstated because many UK companies channelled overseas investment
through holding companies in the Netherlands.
Next in the rankings were the US with Pounds 1.3bn and Australia with Pounds
1bn.
Direct investment into the UK in 1992 amounted to Pounds 9.2bn, an increase
of Pounds 0.8bn on the previous year, but still a significant reduction on
the figures for 1989 and 1990.
North America accounted for 41 per cent of inward investment, a 16 per cent
rise. The EU's share of investment fell 16 per cent to 38 per cent.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Gummer opens extension to Docklands Light Railway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Environment secretary John Gummer yesterday opened the five-mile extension
to the Docklands Light Railway to Beckton in east London after a delay of 18
months.
The Pounds 280m project to extend the railway has been dogged by problems
with construction and systems installation. The extension, which connects
Beckton with the Isle of Dogs and the City, is funded by the London
Docklands Development Corporation.
Mr Gummer also launched the West Silvertown Urban Village, where he took the
controls of a mechanical digger (above).

FT  29 MAR 94 / Bank mortgage lending rises after long decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading British banks undertook slightly more mortgage lending in February
than in January, but the increase was almost certainly seasonal, the British
Bankers' Association said yesterday.
Figures from the BBA showed gross lending at Pounds 1.04bn last month, up
from Pounds 1.01bn in January.
This rise of almost 3 per cent arrested the trend of seven successive
monthly falls, but still represents the second-lowest figure since the BBA
began compiling the information on a monthly basis last spring.
Seasonally adjusted figures for net lending fell again, to Pounds 576m in
February from Pounds 588m in January. But mortgage approvals - which are
seen as an important indicator of the state of the market - rose sharply
last month to 24,935 approvals with a value of Pounds 1.20bn. The comparable
figures for January were 19,297 approvals with a value of Pounds 914m.
Mr John Ecklin, BBA director of statistics, said the figures for bank
mortgage lending reflected some 'fightback' by building societies in
regaining market share they had lost to the banks in 1993. Their extra share
came partly from the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages, but also indicated
a more general recovery.
'If you put together approvals and commitments, it looks as though the
overall market is getting relatively healthy,' Mr Ecklin said.
One sign of the recent shift in market share is that the building society
sector is beginning to show year-on-year increases for the monthly mortgage
lending figures while the figures for banks are broadly similar to a year
ago.
The Building Societies Association reported an increase in net new
commitments last month to Pounds 2.93bn - the highest level since July last
year, and some 8 per cent higher than February last year.
The leading British banks include eight of the 20 largest mortgage lenders
in the UK.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Light rail link open after long delay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Environment secretary Mr John Gummer yesterday opened the five-mile
extension to the Docklands Light Railway to Beckton in east London after a
delay of 18 months.
The Pounds 280m project to extend the railway has been dogged by problems
with construction and systems installation.
The extension, which connects Beckton with the Isle of Dogs and the City, is
funded by the London Docklands Development Corporation, set up to regenerate
the old docks area.
The extension takes the DLR to within a few hundred yards of the City
airport in east London but, in a hangover from the poor transport planning
which has bedevilled development of the area, there is still no station at
the airport.
Mr Gummer also launched the West Silvertown Urban Village, a development of
1,500 homes by Peabody Trust, the charitable housing provider, together with
the LDDC, the local authority and Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners
group.
The scheme, based on the Prince of Wales' ideas of integrated communities,
is being backed by the government's private finance initiative and will be
built over eight to 10 years.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Manager aims to kick a deal into touch: Peter Marsh meets a
customer who feels the OFT does not go far enough on photocopier leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Frank Wright, purchasing manager of the Rugby Football Union, spent
yesterday trying to kick into touch a photocopier leasing deal which will
cost Pounds 68,000 over the next five years unless he cancels the agreement
at the cost of Pounds 23,000.
Mr Wright criticised yesterday's report by the Office of Fair Trading for
not going far enough to regulate the photocopier supply industry, in spite
of its criticisms of malpractices in offering contracts.
Four years ago the union - which regulates the affairs of about 3,000 rugby
clubs in England and is based in Twickenham, west London - signed an
agreement with Southern Business Group, a big photocopier supplier, to lease
a machine over nine years.
Mr Wright said the original agreement would have meant the union paying
Pounds 198,000 over nine years, with a penalty payment of Pounds 60,000 for
opting out.
Southern has since agreed to modify the terms, involving a 30 per cent cut
in the monthly leasing charge. Mr Wright still feels aggrieved about the
amount the union is paying.
He said the original contract, agreed before he joined the union, was signed
by another officer 'without a great deal of thought'.
The agreement, based on the union paying 2.5p per month for every paper
copied, with leasing charges on top, seemed good at the time. But, Mr Wright
said, the union had not fully worked out how much it would cost over the
time of the contract.
'Once we signed up, we were hooked,' he said.
Mr Wright would have liked the OFT paper to go further in forcing the
industry to be more open about the costs of contracts, with greater
protection for consumers who feel they get a raw deal.
Mr David McErlain, chairman of Southern, said: 'The union's legal position
is hopeless, but we have listened constructively to what Mr Wright has to
say.
'We want to maintain a commercial relationship with the bloke. We are now
down to honest-to-goodness bartering, proving that we can be flexible.'
He said that many of the high leasing charges in the industry in the early
1990s stemmed from the high interest rates at that time. As borrowing costs
had come down, the industry had been able to pass on these reductions to
customers.
The fall in interest rates had been reflected in Southern's offer to reduce
the cost to the union of opting out of the supply contract from Pounds
60,000 to Pounds 28,000.
As to the 'malpractices and excesses' which the OFT had identified in some
sections of the industry, he conceded that 'some companies have been slow to
react to criticism'. In Southern's case, however, the company was always
willing to listen to its customers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINTING MONEY: HOW THE COSTS OF LEASING PHOTOCOPIERS STACK UP
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Long-term contracts were condemned by the Office of Fair Trading as
prone to unscrupulous selling practices. Costs facing three companies on
a base case of:
 -Mid-range monochrome copier, list price pounds 5,000
 -Lease based on payments of pounds 530 per quarter: Pounds 106 per
  quarter for each pounds 1,000 to be financed
 -Cost - excluding paper - of 1p per copy
 -Monthly volume of 15,000 copies
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over three years
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pounds 10,300
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMER A has a three-year lease. He has managed to negotiate 25% off
list price and has kept service price escalation* down to 2% per annum.
After three years he has paid pounds 10,300 and his contract has been
completed
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over five years
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pounds 19,900
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMER B has a five-year lease and has accepted 15% per annum service
price escalation. After three years he has paid about pounds 10,800 and
is committed to pay a further pounds 9,100 over the remaining two years
of his contract.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over nine years
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pounds 52,800
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMER C has been attracted by the low cost-per-copy on longer
contracts. He has taken out a nine-year contract with 15% per annum
service price escalation. He also has lease charges 25% higher than the
base case. After three-years he has paid pounds 11,800 and is committed
to pay another pounds 41,000 over the remaining six years.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'After three years, many machines could start needing a lot of servicing
and perform with irritating breakdowns. They may also be technologically
obsolescent,' says the OFT report

FT  29 MAR 94 / Delors guarantee may sway sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers were preparing last night for a tough fight to sell the European
Union enlargement compromise to sceptical Conservative backbenchers.
The key is likely to be a written guarantee from Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, of British independence in social and
employment matters.
The assurance, which the government hopes to receive this morning, would
signal an end to EU attempts to use health-and-safety legislation to
circumvent Britain's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty.
The assurance is intended to address widespread fears among Conservative
backbenchers that the EU is determined to roll back de-regulatory reforms
introduced by the Conservatives since 1979.
The most recent example occurred two weeks ago, when the government was
forced to announce a Pounds 65m increase in maternity payments because of a
European directive.
Other examples include:
A European parliament vote to force Britain to limit working hours for young
people such as paper boys and girls. The government wants the vote
overturned, if necessary by the European Court.
A House of Lords ruling that the 1978 Employment Protection Act is unlawful
because it fails to comply with EU legislation on the rights of part-time
workers.
Other social and employment policy initiatives emerging from Brussels are
equally at odds with the liberalising instincts of the British government.
These include proposals for compulsory works councils, which would give
unions a voice in running British companies.
Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is preparing a green
paper on job creation which is expected to culminate in a social action plan
to help halve the EU's level of unemployment to 9m workers.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Tory MPs braced for EU deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MPs were last night edging towards sullen acceptance of the
compromise over reforms to European Union voting procedures hammered out by
EU foreign ministers in Greece last weekend.
After a bubbly 45-minute performance by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, in the Commons yesterday, it was clear that hardcore
Euro-sceptics still thought the cabinet should today reject the deal.
But the self-styled Euro-realists to the centre and centre-right of the
party appeared to be steeling themselves to accept what they almost
unanimously regarded as a government climbdown.
Mr Hurd's carefully-worded responses to MPs' questions appeared to have
convinced only a handful of the doubters on the Conservative backbenches
that the concessions he had secured were of much importance. Mr David Evans,
the outspoken MP for Welwyn Hatfield and a member of the executive of the
1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, summed up the mood: 'I hope they (the
cabinet) stick to their guns. But everything points to a giving-way -
however they wrap it up.'
Even those MPs who saw nothing objectionable in Sunday's deal were generally
critical of the government's tactics, which had seen Mr John Major side very
publicly with Conservative Euro-sceptics at prime minister's questions last
Tuesday.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, MP for Upminster and chairman of the Commons defence
committee said: 'I think the compromise is probably one which is acceptable.
But I don't think the particular stand which the government has taken is one
that necessarily need have been taken in the circumstances.'
The Labour MPs barracking Mr Hurd with shouts of 'grand old Duke of York' in
the Commons had learnt their lines from what many Tories were whispering in
private.
While studiously avoiding giving any indication of what his recommendation
to his cabinet colleagues will be on the matter today, Mr Hurd said
Britain's tough negotiating position had ensured there would be a 'root and
branch' review of qualified majority voting - the system at the centre of
the current row - in two years.
In the 'transitional' period leading up to the review, the EU presidency and
all members of the council would be 'legally bound' to work for an agreement
on the basis of a 23-vote minority.
This allows two large member states and one small one to muster 23 votes in
order to block decisions.
But the foreign secretary acknowledged that decisions would be able to be
taken on the basis of a larger blocking majority of 27 if all other avenues
were exhausted.
Asked by one Tory MP whether he would be prepared to resort to the so-called
Luxembourg compromise, enshrining Britain's right to veto EU legislation
when it considers vital national interest is at stake, Mr Hurd gave an
assurance that he would.
The Euro-sceptic position was best articulated by Mr Bill Cash, MP for
Stafford. He said that the cabinet should turn down the compromise because
arrangements for the proposed review were not included in the accession
treaty.
Mr Cash said that unless this was done there would be no guarantee that
Britain could unravel 'any decision that had been arrived at in the
meantime'.
Other Euro-sceptics later put it more bluntly. One said the government
should reject the deal 'straight down the line.' He added: 'What is more
important - uniting the party or enlargement? How many votes are there in
enlargement?'
Another said: 'If John Major accepts this, I don't think there is any
further useful function he can serve the country or the party.'
For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said it would have
been difficult to devise a sequence of events which did more damage to
Britain's interests and reputation in Europe than the confused and
contradictory behaviour of this government over the past three weeks.
In the Lords, there was an unusually sharp exchange between Lord Tebbit and
Baroness Chalker, with the Foreign Office minister attacking the strongly
Euro-sceptic former Conservative party chairman for endorsing opposition
criticism of Mr Major.
Lady Chalker said Lord Tebbit - who said that the government had been
'turned over' in the recent negotiations - 'seems to put agreement with
political opponents before loyalty to his own party'.
Lord Tebbit remarked that he agreed with 'much that was said' by Lord
Richard, the Labour leader in the Lords, and Lord Jenkins of Hillhead,
leader of the Liberal Democrat peers.
Lord Richard described the negotiations over the future size of the EU
blocking minority as 'one of the most crass pieces of British diplomacy I
can remember'.
Lord Jenkins condemned the prime minister's desperate attempt 'to save his
own skin' and commented on the 'pathetic spectacle of a weak man trying to
behave like a strong man'.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Scott report delay offers boost to Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The politically explosive Scott report into arms sales to Iraq is likely to
be delayed until November or December, it emerged yesterday.
The inquiry was due to be completed by the middle of the year but the delay,
for administrative reasons, is a rare piece of good news for Mr John Major.
It means that the report will not be available until after the Conservative
party's annual conference in October, when Mr Major is likely to be fighting
for his political life.
Publication before the conference would have been a nightmare for party
managers, who already expect to have to explain away poor results in the
forthcoming local and European parliament elections.
The delay increases the prospect of a government reshuffle during the summer
Commons recess, when ministers expected to be criticised by Lord Justice
Scott could be moved or dropped.
Conservative MPs expect Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to be the
prime casualty. Others expected to be criticised include Mr William
Waldegrave, minister responsible for open government, and Mr Alan Clark, the
former trade minister, who has left the Commons.
A summer reshuffle would allow Mr Major to lessen the impact of the report
by arguing that the three ministers expected to be most severely criticised
had already left the government.
From the government's point of view, the main drawback of the delay is that
the report is likely to appear while parliament is sitting, allowing MPs to
comment under parliamentary privilege.
Publication in November, instead of September as anticipated, could also
complicate matters for Mr Major if the Conservative party is in the throes
of a leadership election. However, possible challengers such as Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, may also sustain political damage.
The inquiry's timetable has slipped because of the volume of evidence, the
judge's difficulties in obtaining some government papers, and problems in
scheduling witnesses for oral hearings.
The judge is understood to believe that the revised target is 'realistic'.
The inquiry will today take evidence from its final ministerial witness, the
former trade minister Lord Trefgarne, before going into recess for over a
month.
There will be a further week of oral hearings in May, when Lord Justice
Scott will take evidence from senior Customs officials.
By the end of this week, the judge will have taken written evidence from 166
witnesses, sat in public session for over 400 hours and gathered around
200,000 pages of documents.

Ultimately it is in no one's interest to award qualifications not merited by

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected calls for changes to the criminal injuries
compensation scheme, in spite of Labour's warnings that thousands of victims
would be worse off because of it.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, acknowledged that some claimants would
get less compensation under the new scheme.
But he said at least 54 per cent would get as much or more and receive their
award more quickly.
Labour's appeal for the new compensation scheme to be withdrawn was defeated
by 296 votes to 269, a government majority of 27.

Allegations of racial discrimination and serious assault against police
officers rose sharply last year, but the total of complaints of all kinds
fell, the Police Complaints Authority said yesterday.
The authority considered 17,991 complaints last year, a fall of 7 per cent
on the previous year.
The number of complaints of racial discrimination rose from 67 in 1992 to
291. Disciplinary action was taken on 4 per cent of those complaints,
compared with 10 per cent of all investigated complaints.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Hurd persists with his unrewarding duties: Philip Stephens
assesses the mood of the foreign secretary at the end of an unwinnable
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No, Mr Douglas Hurd is not planning to resign. Nor do his present intentions
include taking advantage of the expected cabinet reshuffle in the summer to
forsake the Foreign Office for a career writing novels or making money in
the City.
The past few weeks have not been easy for the foreign secretary.
It was inevitable after the protracted and unwinnable battle with Britain's
partners over voting rights in an enlarged European Union that colleagues
should speculate that Mr Hurd might be ready to depart. He is after all 64,
has a young family, and not much money.
But barring a rejection by the cabinet this morning of the compromise deal
he negotiated in Greece at the weekend - and for all his public
circumspection Mr Hurd believes that is highly unlikely - he intends to stay
on for some time yet.
His performance in the House of Commons in defence of the new voting system
once Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden join the EU was that of a
politician who still enjoys playing the game even when he is dealt a bad
hand.
The foreign secretary was clearly defending the indefensible. But he did it
with an aplomb - and a sense of humour - which belied the mess into which Mr
John Major's government has once again plunged itself.
Mr Hurd is said by friends to be deeply dismayed by the fact that the
enlargement of the EU - for long a British priority - has been overshadowed
by the less-than-edifying battle over the rights of minorities to block
decisions.
The entry of four new countries might once have been presented as a triumph.
Instead Mr Hurd will be forced to spend the next two days persuading sullen
backbench Tory MPs that the voting deal is not a sell-out.
The foreign secretary's reputation has not escaped unscathed. His genteel
self-confidence and his insistence that the compromise was one worth having
could not disguise the fact that Britain lost this particular battle.
Colleagues wondered why he could not carry the cabinet with him earlier in
negotiating a less public climbdown. Friends shrugged and said it would not
have been as easy as it might have looked. At one stage there was even a
possibility that Britain might win.
Others said he was irritated by the way Mr Major's habit of indulging the
Tory Euro-sceptics had made it much more difficult to prepare the ground for
a deal which fell short of the government's ambitions.
More generally, Mr Hurd appears frustrated by the failure of the
Conservative party to put last year's rows over the Maastricht treaty behind
it and to come to terms with Britain's place in Europe.
His frustration showed in a speech last week designed to provide a text for
cabinet colleagues and backbench MPs alike in the approach to June's
elections to the European parliament.
Britain was tied irrevocably to the rest of Europe. It was lunatic to argue
over something so obvious. With his eye perhaps on the cabinet's
Euro-sceptics he dismissed as risible the idea Europe could be refashioned
into nothing more than a free trade area.
He voiced fears that more fundamental forces - in the former Communist bloc,
in the US attitude to Nato, in the new roles being assumed by Germany and
France - could jeopardise Britain's international standing.
In his own words: 'I must warn that as a nation we have not yet come to
grips with the new debate . . . Unless we can lift our sights and see more
clearly how the world around us has shifted we shall put at risk Britain's
position in the world.'
What he is looking for now is some clear political water in which to develop
that theme. He wants to bequeath a policy framework within which all but the
extremists in the Tory party can happily work.
It is a formidable agenda but perhaps with one vital flaw. It assumes that
Mr Major's government will survive its expected trouncing in this summer's
mid-term elections without another cataclysmic upheaval.
But the Conservative party could have a new leader by the end of the year.
In those circumstances Mr Hurd would leave to someone else the task of
giving it a coherent foreign policy.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Council tax to rise by only 2.1% on average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Council tax will increase by an average of only 2.1 per cent, rather than
the government prediction of 7 per cent, when its second year starts at the
beginning of next month.
The figures, published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, show that Liverpool, where no party has overall control, will
have the highest tax. This year's average for properties in band D  - priced
between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 - will rise 19.5 per cent to Pounds
866.72. This is followed by the Labour-controlled cities of Manchester and
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with Pounds 777.62 and Pounds 725.20.
Conservative-controlled Westminster, where councillors were accused this
year of gerrymandering, has the lowest tax - Pounds 245 for band D.
Councils said the government's new formula for allocating grants to councils
had caused most of the differences. Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle,
said the figures showed that 'these days, council finances are firmly in the
grip of the government'. He said authorities could only pass on the effects
of changes in government grants and of the 'capping' criteria, which the
environment department can use to force councils to cut budgets.
Three Labour councils have set taxes above the limits set for them by the
government, and might now be 'capped'.
Langbaurgh on Tees in Cleveland is preparing to spend Pounds 17.3m, rather
than its 'cap' of Pounds 16.6m next year. Slough in Berkshire left its
budget unchanged at Pounds 15.16m, but suffered the biggest cut in standard
spending of any council according to Local Government Chronicle - from
Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 14.25m. Sheffield set a budget of Pounds 384m, Pounds
6m above its capping limit.
