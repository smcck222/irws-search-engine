FT  26 FEB 94 / Gentlemen, players, and bad losers: Dominic Lawson wonders
why the British whined so when Torvill and Dean were beaten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON

<TEXT>
How sad it is to have to confirm that, on the sporting field, from the
sweltering cricket pitches of Jamaica to the icy rinks of Norway, Britain
has become not just a nation of losers, but a nation of bad losers.
Of the reports in yesterday's newspapers of the England cricket team's loss
to the West Indies, on average about two-thirds of the space was given over
to whingeing about the allegedly unfair treatment meted out to Devon Malcolm
(England) by Courtney Walsh (West Indies). For those of you who, perhaps
wisely, have avoided reading these interminable moans, the single fact
involved is that the West Indian fast bowler subjected the least able
English batsman to a series of short-pitched deliveries, during which the
Englishman scored 18 runs and, in return, took four blows to his body.
Among the English commentators who have rushed to denounce Walsh is Bob
Willis. Now Willis was for many years England's most destructive fast
bowler, and by no means averse to a bit of intimidation, especially against
the weakest international opposition. Willis has perhaps forgotten the time
one of his well-directed bouncers removed some of the teeth of Iqbal Qasim,
then the undisputed rabbit of the Pakistani team.
The whining behaviour of the English press, not all of whom, at least, could
be accused of hypocrisy, is particularly unappealing, given Malcolm's own
response. 'It's just part of the game,' he said, adding with the sort of
stoicism that we associate with the English gentleman: 'It's only pain.'
That is where the debate should have ended. But instead the bad losers of
the sporting press carried their whingeing on to the front pages. This time
the target was the group of men and women who judged the ice dance
competition at the winter Olympics.
Apparently it was inconceivable to the 23m people who watched the
competition on BBC Television that the British couple, Torvill and Dean,
could have failed to win. After all, 23m people would not be watching
something as fatuous as an ice dancing competition, unless it were to see an
English couple winning. So it must have been a conspiracy by foreign judges
that prevented the rightful and predicted English victory. And,
conveniently, it was a German judge who gave the lowest marks to the English
couple.
It did not take many commentators long to recall that it was a German
referee who 'robbed' the English football team in its World Cup qualifying
match against the Netherlands last year.
Ice dancing is a completely bogus sport, particularly as an Olympic event.
Let these bland looking couples do their dances on the ice if they must, but
let us not pretend that it is possible objectively to decide, in the precise
order of one to 20, which of them is best, second best, third best, and so
on. Still less should we believe that the public, and its cheer-leaders in
the press, are capable of distinguishing precisely between the merits of
Torvill and Dean as opposed to those of Grichtchuk and Platov, and Useva and
Zhulin, the Russian pairs who gained the gold and silver medals.
I doubt whether more than a tiny proportion of the 23m viewers could now
remember even the names of the winning Russian couple. But I do wonder why
we British have become such consistently bad sporting losers. Perhaps it is
simply that we have recently had a lot of practice at it. Or perhaps there
is some more profound reason.
When Britain was a pre-eminent economic and political power it mattered
relatively little whether we also ruled the sporting world. When you are
controlling a third of the world's population you can afford to be a little
generous on the sporting field.
Even when we failed to win, we knew Britain was still the greatest nation on
earth, and no mere loss of a cricket game could change that. And if the
other side used unfair methods, that merely confirmed British superiority.
But now that the pattern of world affairs leaves us with no special place in
the sun, we have become petulant and bad tempered. And as children of the
welfare state, we are very much at home with the thought that whatever goes
wrong is always someone else's fault.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Beware of Greeks baring teeth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Jurassic Park Crichton is going round telling people that news-
papers are mediasaurs, doomed to be swept into a ditch as the mediafuture
dawns. Perhaps he is right. Everywhere, it is said, newspaper readerships
are falling (the young watch TV) and advertising revenues declining with the
pssphhhh of released air.
But let it not be alleged that Hawks &amp; Handsaws is getting lost in the
clouds, dreamily expiring. It is right in there, at the titanium-hard
cutting edge of mediaworld. In no way or wit is H &amp; H flummoxed by the
latest concepts or sexy media jargon. Communicopia. Global teleputing.
Audiotext. Database management. Facsi- mile-on-demand. Interactivity.
Interactivity - based on a merging of traditional newspaper techniques, TV
systems, super-computers and telephony - is where H &amp; H is at. I have tried
to keep it secret, but H &amp; H has been fully interactive, sparklingly
on-line, for several weeks, part of a study being conducted by MIT and some
nerds in Silicon Valley.
My working day is lengthening. Readers are talking back. Even minor
characters mentioned only hurriedly are getting on to me in real time.
Yesterday I was tapping away when the story suddenly filed itself into the
T-Noel basket and the face of Georgios the biker flashed on to my screen
from a mobile TV studio stationed, he explained, in the village of
Phigaleia, Greece.
Georgios the biker made a two-line appearance in a book review of mine in
last Saturday's FT. He had made a longer appearance in the book under
review: The Pan Principle, Fiona Pitt-Kethley's account of travels in
Greece, looking for traces of Pan. She did not find Pan, but she found
plenty of Greeks, with some of whom she enjoyed, as the review drily noted,
congressional episodes.
One of these episodes was with Georgios the biker. It was not satisfactory.
Georgios proved a thug, and bit Pitt- Kethley violently, through the silk of
her jersey. Two crescents of bruising lasted a week.
Now he was on my screen. Georgios the biker. Speaking to me in real time.
Not a happy man. Reasonably good- looking. Hair round his collar. Forehead
invisible. Virile, no doubt.
I asked, rather sharply: 'What do you want, Georgios?' I assumed he would
berate me about his appearance in the book review, or even in the book. But
that was not why he was calling.
'Sure I picked her up,' he said, referring to Pitt-Kethley. 'What a silly
woman. I expect the book was boring. But what I'm calling to ask is why you
so hate foreigners. French. German. Greek. Especially you hate the Greek. On
16/1/94 you wrote about the Elgin Marbles. You joked about the Marbles, and
about Macedonia.
'You knew what you were doing. Just stirring-up. Hateful. Insulting. Who you
think you are? On 18/12/93 you were rude about the French. Arrogant, you
called them. Described a row in Paris in which you shouted at a Frenchman
because he nearly hit your Rover with his 'lemon-coloured' Citroen - I bet
you make that up - and did not speak the English. Said the French were
stupid, and should all learn to speak the English. More stirring-up.
Gratuitous. Twerpish. Why you bother to do it? Maybe I bite you.'
'Look, Georgios,' I said. 'You have to allow for artistic licence. On
29/1/94 I appeared to be rude about people who live in Kent, part of
southern England. I was discussing the Channel Tunnel, and its high-speed
rail connection between London and the coast. Many people in Kent are angry
with the route of this rail-line. So I said: 'People who live in Kent are a
selfish and common sort, so they can shut up.' But of course I did not mean
that.
'You have to distinguish, Georgios, between the surface meaning of the words
and the meaning underneath. In pretending to write rudely about people who
live in Kent, I was really expressing my admiration for the Channel Tunnel,
and for all feats of macro-engineering, which I happen to find exciting. For
example, the Parthenon and its Marbles.'
Unfortunately, mention of the Marbles triggered a stormy reaction in
Georgios the biker. His black brows knitted furiously. Spittle shot at my
screen.
'I'll catch you,' he screamed. 'And then I'll really bite you.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Built in America - Paula Deitz on the Frank Lloyd
Wright exhibitions in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA DEITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We will never have a culture of our own until we have an architecture of
our own,' is how Frank Lloyd Wright expressed his main idea to the people of
Marin County, California in 1957 when he designed their Civic Center, the
final building of his career.
During his 70-year career which began in the Arts and Crafts movement and
ended in soaring designs at the threshold of the space age, Wright never
lacked for words or ideas in his mission to create an architecture that
became a vehicle for his views. He also oversaw the design of all
publications dealing with his buildings to control how people perceived
them.
This is interesting to keep in mind as one plunges into the Museum of Modern
Art's major retrospective, Frank Lloyd Wright: Architect, which features 350
original drawings; 30 scale models, some newly constructed; six full-scale
mock-ups of innovative wall sections; photographs and assorted architectural
and decorative fragments, covering 190 buildings and projects. And yet, the
picture is not complete without viewing four other concurrent Wright
exhibitions in New York: his decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art; Pedro E. Guerrero's photographs of Wright at work and play over a
20-year period, at the Lobby Gallery; the Guggenheim Museum's survey of
drawings for its own building; and finally, at Columbia University's Arthur
Ross Architecture Gallery, a revealing look at the rare Wasmuth Folios, the
1910-1911 Berlin publication that paired Wright's selection of photographs
and lithographs.
Because Wright orchestrated a unified whole that took into account every
detail of furnishings inside and landscaping outside, the term architect
seems too limiting a definition. He called himself a farmer, architect and
collector, acknowledging his origins in the Wisconsin countryside and his
fascination with the objects he integrated into his interiors. He had the
ability to make a masterpiece out of the quotidian - and did for over 300
suburban American houses.
At MoMA, the exhibition begins with the low-slung prairie house of the
Mid-west, the drawings demonstrating the various stages in devising the
pinwheel arms that rotate around the central vertical element, the hearth.
Placed under a massing of horizontal rooftops, these houses with overhanging
eaves and prowlike profiles exude protective warmth.
Unfortunately, what the multitude of drawings for each house conveys is
lacking in the newly made and colourful models. Wright, in matching
photographs with lithographs, found the diagonal views more dynamic: distant
elevations of houses terraced into hillsides makes them appear like some
elaborate Lamaist temples in Tibet. In comparison the models appear flat and
static. In reality, his settings do direct visitors to the diagonal angle;
nothing in American architecture equals the view of the cantilevered
concrete terraces as seen from below the waterfall at Fallingwater, his
Pennsylvania house for the Kaufmanns.
Though not as sumptuous as the prairie houses, the more modest Usonian
houses he devised conserved space with built-in furniture and cabinetry.
Curiously, their compact, organised spaces are liberating. And the Textile
Block houses in California, with their repeated designs of plain and
ornamental concrete blocks that were also economical, exude an exoticism
akin to Mayan architecture that suits their Los Angeles and Hollywood
settings.
In 1905 Wright went to Japan, where his influence is still strong, if only
to preserve his buildings. Indeed the Imperial Hotel, before its demise, was
like a great Meiji shrine.
His admiration for the techniques of old Japanese prints influenced his
style of presentation drawings.
His career was like a tide that kept coming in, bringing something new each
time. He was a magician of style, always with something new up his sleeve,
and passionately devoted to the quality of life in an America where he
sought to integrate agrarian values into suburban communities. He titled a
photograph of himself standing behind his drafting board like some short
order cook: 'I am an architect. What'll you have?'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Danger is the spur at the Kirov Opera - Max Loppert
talks to Valery Gergiev, whose passionate energy is keeping the operatic
tradition of St Petersburg alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Valery Gergiev, chief conductor and artistic administrator of the Kirov
Opera of St Petersburg, sits in one of the ornately stuccoed side-offices of
the Maryinsky Theatre, cradling a can of beer and reflecting on the urgency
of his mission. It is late; he has already conducted a Rimsky-Korsakov opera
and the dress rehearsal of an about-to-open new Rimsky-Korsakov production,
let alone all the organisational confabs that seem to fill his every minute
in between.
But plainly Gergiev's energy-supply equals his passion for the task of
keeping the Kirov Opera alive and kicking. Of the difficulty of that task he
is in no doubt. 'This is a terrible time for the country. Many parts of this
city are in a very bad state. We have to show that there is at least one
reason for people to have pride in St Petersburg.' Few of the world's
leading opera companies convey a greater sense of do-or-die importance in
their commitment, or manage to forge ahead in conditions apparently so
comprehensively unfavourable to progress.
In the week of the Kirov's Rimsky-Korsakov in the 20th Century Festival the
rouble dropped from 1,450 to 1,600 to the dollar. This was, of course, not
an isolated fall. Remember the Chinese curse - 'may you live in interesting
times'? In this sense these are indeed interesting times for the country,
most of whose cultural institutions are engaged in the simple attempt at
survival.
At the Kirov Opera, the difference is that living dangerously has proved a
spur, not a bar, to artistic vitality. State support, now down to about 20
per cent of company budget, pays only for salaries - and, Gergiev says,
'they are low, far too low'. Box-office revenue is not a serious
consideration: although foreigners pay dollar prices for tickets, up to
Dollars 45 for best seats, top level for locals is only 5,000 roubles. This
reflects Gergiev's concern to keep in touch with his 'real' public: 'We are
not going to punish the people of Russia who love opera. They already have
many things unavailable, even food, and are living from day to day.'
Money for productions must be found from other sources. The main one is the
contract Gergiev and the Kirov Opera have fixed with Philips, which has led
to a superb stream of Russian discs. The Philips connection is crucial, and
highly demanding. During the festival live concert recordings and non-live
operatic ones were taking up every spare second of Gergiev's time.
Foreign tours - never with easy-sell Boris and Onegin schedules but always
with material genuinely reflecting the company's current preoccupations -
have become a regular feature. The Friends of the Kirov, a British
organisation (president: Placido Domingo, who sang a Kirov Otello last year)
that has sprung up alongside Gergiev's London link with the Royal
Philharmonic, is already enthusiastically spreading the word about the
company; other friends' groups are planned in other cities.
Meanwhile, the Kirov Opera operates on a knife-edge. The company has no
press officer and very little in the way of permanently attached artistic
direction; Gergiev's right-hand man also plays oboe in the orchestra and
teaches at the Conservatory. As a leading British opera-house administrator
visiting the festival wryly put it, 'This certainly all gives one pause
about how many people you actually need to run an opera house]'.
But so skeletal an administrative complement does not lend itself to quick
decision-making: according to a Western opera-house boss trying to
co-ordinate the future acquisition of one of the Kirov's Rimsky-Korsakov
productions, hanging around for meetings whose conclusions must then be
re-confirmed with other outposts of the Maryinsky bureaucracy, is a draining
one: 'What this company needs is just one good business manager]'.
What it does have, instead, is the extraordinary Gergiev, a 'one-man
powerhouse who can make anything sound possible' according to a recent Opera
profile. He came into the job five-and-a-half years ago, at the age of 35.
New freedoms were opening up; 'never before', he says, 'had we felt power
like that - suddenly we felt strong, all 400 or 500 artists'.
Not a native Petersburger - he was born in Moscow and grew up in the
Caucasus - he came to the city as a student; and its glorious musical
tradition, as exemplified by the Philharmonic Orchestra, the Conservatory
and the Maryinsky, have inspired his own musical gifts.
The preservation of that tradition, at least the operatic part, is now the
torch he carries. But Gergiev's is no hidebound version of preservation:
continual renewal and reclamation (such as the restoration in Tchaikovsky's
Iolanta and Rimsky-Korsakov's Kitezh of all textual references to
Christianity long censored in the Soviet era) are its characterising
features.
He has invited in production talent from the West - Graham Vick, David
Freeman, Tim Hopkins, Brigitte Fassbaender - while resisting the notion that
fashionably interventionist Western staging styles should be sought for
everything. A handful of his top singers have moved westwards; more numerous
are the ones such as Galina Gorchakova and Olga Borodina, blossoming world
stars who keep homes in the city and their Kirov links alive by, inter alia,
trying out new roles under Gergiev's care. The bait of the Philips Kirov
recordings is evidently a succulent one.
Above all, his artistic policy is to re-examine the St Petersburg
inheritance and spark vital new connections. The Prokofiev, Mussorgsky and
Rimsky festivals have all been undertaken in this light; next year's
large-scale survey of the 'Russian' Stravinsky - a Petersburg composer whose
towering stature is still not conclusively established in Russia - will
continue the process. New operas are being commissioned.
And so the work goes on: round the clock, it appears. Can it all last?
Gergiev wisely evades all future speculation, preferring to close our
midnight conversation with a ruefully humorous observation: 'If everyone in
Russia could work as hard as we have done here in the last five years, there
would be no economic problems]'.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: The Bjork saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bjork is the biggest thing to come out of Iceland since Eric the Red. First
as front singer for cutesy band the Sugarcubes, and now very much her own
invention, she has done even more for her home land than the cod. With a
smash album, Debut, riding the charts, and a brace of Brit awards in her
anorak, the lady was in sparky form at the Royalty on Thursday night.
Bjork rhymes with squawk, and she likes to interpret her songs through
screeches, little chirrups, and sudden croaks. Anyone bored with waiting for
Kate Bush would be happy with Bjork. Apart from her unsettling vocal attack
she also has Kate Bushed in her stage mannerisms. She scampers on like a
bird in white satin, swooping with outstretched arms before settling at the
mike. There are plenty of jumps and skips during the performance as well as
geisha like bobbing gestures.
Of course it is outrageously contrived, but fun. The songs, mainly about
love among the glaciers, are excellent, plaintive and pure, especially the
genuine frustrations in 'There's more to life than this' and the credibly
innocent 'Violently Happy'. It took the audience time to adjust to this
doll-like creature with the corkscrew curls overdosing on whimsy, but
eventually they were on their feet swaying to music with a clever dance
rhythm behind its innocence. Then it was 'thank you vewy, vewy, vewy, much'
and off for the next stage in the saga. The band was noisy, but what's new.
This odd little talent will go mega.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Ariodante' updated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The presence of Dame Janet Baker in the audience was a reminder of how
Handel's public has widened since she made a name for herself singing his
operas with specialist groups. Hardly a company wants to be without one of
two of Handel's more famous operas, even if they rarely become a regular
fixture.
It is helpful to keep an eye on economy, if a production is unlikely to be
revived often. Welsh National Opera is presenting Ariodante in a
co-production with ENO, which should represent a small saving for two
companies in need of a big financial boost. When David Alden's modern vision
of the opera was first seen in London, it predictably caused a controversy,
which no doubt helped sell a few extra seats.
In Cardiff it looks stylish, colourful, well tailored to the size of the
theatre. A baroque ceiling adorned with cherubs looks down on the stage, but
the events that unfold below belong to the modern world. Alden wants to take
Handel's 18th-century structure and fill it with the concerns and emotions
of the 1990s until it is fit to burst - a process that he cannot resist
following through to its explosive conclusion.
Flunkeys set a table in slow motion; reptilian armed men stalk their prey;
inmates from one of Hogarth's mad-houses creep around. Each group is a
walking modern-opera cliche and does nothing to help understanding of the
emotional issues, which Alden is well able to probe through his direction of
the singers. After Orlando in Aix-en-Provence it was interesting to see
Felicity Palmer again in an emotionally unbuttoned Handel production.
Polinesso is a less interesting role, but the unabashed force of her
performance is unmistakable.
Altogether WNO has put together a creditable cast. There is a well
contrasted pair of sopranos, Alwyn Mellor warmly lyrical in Ginevra's music
of lament, Susannah Waters lighter and sharper of voice as Dalinda. Likewise
the two tenors: Gregory Cross as the stronger Lurcanio, Philip Daggett the
more sensitive Odoardo. Umberto Chiummo made a reliable King of Scotland.
Decorations from all of them were inclined to be over-the-top. Otherwise
musical matters were safe in the hands of conductor Marc Minkowski, who has
only to get a bit more agreement on tempos from the WNO musicians.
In Ariodante's showpiece arias Della Jones set a speed one notch slower than
Minkowski had in mind, though still fast enough. For all her spirit not all
the music shows this invigorating Handelian to best advantage these days
('Dopo notte', a favourite among Dame Janet's recordings, failed to clinch
the evening). Where she did excel was in the deep feeling of 'Scherza
infida', pensive, despairing, bitter, every word alive with meaning. This
was one aria where WNO's decision to perform the opera in Italian was a
bonus.
New Theatre, Cardiff tonight; then on tour

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Sopranos fall flat - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Three Tenors are having a return match. They are getting together in
Pasadena just before the start of the World Cup in June hoping to repeat the
success of their last venture into popular culture, which took them spinning
up the pop charts. The incentive is a Dollars 12m fee.
But while Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras are all reasonable men, prepared
to drown their rivalries in return for money in the bank, no such good
fortune followed an attempt to cash in with The Three Sopranos. Kiri Te
Kanawa, Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle were invited to get together in
Vienna on another money making spree. The ladies could not even agree on
their frocks and the idea was quickly abandoned.
It is hard to mention international singers without referring to money.
Domingo has been approached to star in the movie version of Phantom of the
Opera, a booking which could be worth around Dollars 20m. He is very keen,
but wants to test himself in the role first. So plans are afoot to give him
a week's trial in the stage version. Its quite possible that anyone with a
ticket for Phantom at the Haymarket in the next few months could be sharing
the experience with a cuddly Spanish tenor.
This week Covent Garden made its pitch for millennium money. In the dear,
dead, old days of the late 1980s it hoped to finance the badly needed
renovation of the Opera House by renting out offices and shops on the site.
It has now re-launched the scheme, substituting as fairy godmother, the
Millennium Fund for offices. The cost now will be around Pounds 100m.
The Millennium Fund will be one of the five beneficiaries of the Lottery
when it comes on stream next year. No one knows how much people will bet: if
they are cautious then around Pounds 70m a year will be available for
Millennium projects; if they love the idea it could be Pounds 200m. If the
higher target is reached then Covent Garden stands a good chance of scooping
some of the cash set aside for London.
The Lottery Commissioners have made it clear they will spread the largesse
around the country, and the London tranche is already being fought over by
the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art; a smartened up South Bank; an
Albertropolis of museums in Kensington; and a theme park in Greenwich.
By getting its bid in early Covent Garden hopes for the best. It should know
by early next year whether it has been chosen as a millennium project. It
will then launch its public appeal. The ideal financial break down for the
project would be around Pounds 15m from commercial rents; Pounds 35m from
the Lottery; and the remaining Pounds 50m from rich and loyal friends like
Lord Sainsbury, Lord Rothschild, and Mrs Vivien Duffield.
If all goes well Covent Garden will close for rebuilding in the autumn of
1997; move temporarily to the Theatre Royal Drury Lane; and return to the
Royal Opera House by the autumn of 2000 in time for the millennial
celebrations.
When asked to name his achievements at the Arts Council, out-going boss
Anthony Everitt boldly plumped for Arts 2000. This was Lord Palumbo's wheeze
under which a different city or region hosted a different art form each year
up to the millennium.
It has proved a hit and miss affair, getting off to a good start with
Birmingham City of Music in 1992; faltering with East Midlands Region of
Dance last year; and certainly helping Manchester City of Drama 1994 to keep
open theatres which had been faced with closure because of capping. Swansea
City of Literature in 1995 has had terrible management problems but now the
council has stepped in to avoid humiliation; and Northern Region is hosting
the Visual Arts in 1996.
This week, rather surprisingly, East of England beat off bids by Devon &amp;
Cornwall and Leeds to become the region of Opera and Musical Theatre in
1997. It is getting Pounds 500,000 from the Council, the largest grant to
date, to make good its ambitious policy of new commissions.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Bronte country can go with the wind - Nigel Spivey
suggests an unorthodox solution to the Haworth moors controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY

<TEXT>
A decade ago, the correct position for the liberal intellectual of London
NW3 was clear enough. Support the Yorkshire coal miners; rally behind the
time-honoured extraction of fossil fuels; defy the Thatcherite logic of pit
closures.
It was a cause both brave and easy to espouse. To the literary mind, it
called up comfortingly noble images of gaunt men in hob-nailed boots
gathering under great iron wheels, or women in shawls mashing tea by
blackened cottage hearths. Futile, of course: if coal is not wanted, coal
miners must pass away, whether Hampstead cherishes them or not.
So the North gets the message. No-one wants fossil fuels, and in any case
they cause holes in the atmosphere. Robbed of their collieries, the district
councils of Lancashire and Yorkshire hit upon new schemes for lighting their
streets and boiling their kettles.
This is wind power. Hitherto the stuff of New Age dreamers in far-off parts
of west Wales and Jutland, or schemes which got no further than the
blueprints of crank utopians, wind power must have blown into the practical
North on the wings of divine inspiration.
What could be better? No shortage of breezes up on the moors; no shortage of
under-subsidised hill farmers, ready to turn wind into brass; best of all,
no shortage of right-on one-upmanship, as the grimy North shows the pure
South what energy can be generated without a smidgin of uranium or mess.
But what the councillors of Bradford and Calderdale reckoned without is the
alternative map of England. This enjoys only minority acknowledgement, but
that minority is articulate, noisy and influential. According to its
preferred nomenclature, England is divided along the proprietorial lines of
distinguished writers. So you could travel from Daphne du Maurier's
Cornwall, progress to Hardy's Wessex; perhaps head up to Housman's
Shropshire, and across to Bennett's Midlands; thence up through Lawrence's
Nottingham and onwards to Wordsworth's Lakes. In the course of this journey,
naturally, you would have to negotiate the Brontes' Yorkshire.
The Brontes' Yorkshire. The passport for entry is to have read Emily
Bronte's Wuthering Heights; the objective of travelling there is to see the
old family parsonage, home to the Bronte Society since 1927; perhaps seek
out the site of Thrushcross Grange, or Lowood School, or the Haworth
graveyard.
But, above all, to cast your gaze across the same tussocked wilderness as
met the eyes of Cathy and Heathcliff; watch the same plovers dip into the
ling; inhale the same heady west wind. It is still a fair impetuous wind.
And the crime of the local councils is to have tamed it into boiling
kettles.
Leafy Hampstead sprang into alliance with the Brontes' Yorkshire last week
with a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, signed by 60 names.
Admittedly, they are not homogeneously Hampstead: Iris Murdoch sits oddly
with Cliff Richard, who (odder still) plans to be Heathcliff in a new London
musical, and the coalition of Ted Hughes with Auberon Waugh is provoking.
But these signatories are bound by the insistence that wind turbines shall
not be erected within a 20-mile radius of Haworth (sorry, the Brontes'
Haworth), because they constitute 'an assault upon our artistic and our
literary heritage.'
When utopian dreams of putting wind to work are turned into blasphemies
against nature, one has to question the pieties behind this protest. It is
an unusual conflict, in which the conservationists of the earth's atmosphere
find themselves opposed by conservationists of a literary ambience.
The reason is that in the secular society of modern intellectuals, the
houses of great writers have supplanted saintly shrines as places of
pilgrimage. Relics must be preserved, the landscape of worship maintained.
Seeing is believing. We will not understand Wuthering Heights if we cannot
roll our eyes across Emily's own moors. That must be the ultimate ground on
which the protestors stand.
Thus exposed, it reduces to a naive view of the human imagination. And it
imposes a strictly Romantic definition upon beauty, whereby wilderness alone
is chief of the muses. It would be interesting to learn how many of the
protestors would consider retrospectively demolishing all the windmills of
Suffolk - Constable's Suffolk - or indeed that unsightly water mill at
Flatford. Or are such man-made intrusions acceptable once touched by the
brush or pen of a genius?
Here lies the only solution to this issue. Bradford council, which is
hospitable to the creative spirit, must commission a work of art. It may be
a poem, a novel or a grand painting; it may be a film, even a soap opera. An
everyday tale of wind-farming folk: their trials, passions, couplings and
bereavements. If it is done, and done well, I dare say we will look kindly
upon the turbines of the West Riding.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Bussell dances Balanchine - Alastair Macaulay watched
this British ballerina show New York audiences a thing or two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While other ballet companies are still learning how to dance the
choreography of George Balanchine, New York City Ballet - the company he
founded in 1948 and, until his death in 1983, shaped - is forgetting. The
irony is tremendous.
This month, Darcey Bussell, the remarkable 24-year-old British ballerina,
danced five performances with NYCB, appearing in Balanchine's Agon and
Symphony in C. (She is the first Royal Ballet ballerina ever to appear with
this company; her success was such that the company gave an extra
unscheduled performance of Agon with her.)
It could be seen at once that these great two ballerina roles - one so bold
and modern, danced in leotard and tights, to Stravinsky's extraordinary
venture into atonalism; the other so resplendently serene, danced in white
tutu to Bizet's symphony - had not been performed on this scale since the
legendary Suzanne Farrell quit dancing them over ten years ago. True, there
is still plenty for Bussell to learn about how to dance Balanchine. But how
strange and thrilling to see that she understands much of the essence of
Balanchine style better than most of those about her.
Even until 1987, NYCB was like no other ballet company; more than that, it
was one of the supreme cultural institutions of this century. Classicism,
modernism, romanticism: you went to NYCB to see all these things in
excelsis. And at the same time you went to see a quintessential expression
of New York's own spirit. 'High-density grandeur' I remember writing on
umpteen postcards home during my first visit to New York 15 years ago; I was
referring to the thrill of both the city and its ballet company.
Today, New York City Ballet is a very proficient troupe. Probably no other
troupe in the world can match it for speed, or lower-body virtuosity. But
these are relatively superficial virtues. What has been gradually eroding at
City Ballet is the basic core of energy, musically shaped energy, classical
energy pouring from the centre of the body through gleamingly turned-out
limbs. What you used to see onstage at NYCB was as glorious as the Chrysler
Building in the sunlight; whereas now you see Trump Tower glitz.
That kind of coolly radiant classical energy is just what Bussell has in
spades. Dancing Agon, she is prodigious. The still astounding rhythms
(mixing jazz, atonalism, and baroque), bodily shapes (mixing Greek imagery,
Renaissance court dance, traditional ballet classicism), and phrases (taut,
lean, unpredictable, explosive) of this choreography have been scaled down
at NYCB over the past ten years - but with Bussell (as Covent Garden has
already seen) the 1957 masterwork becomes again huge, sharp, audacious. In
one lift in the great pas de deux, spread across her partner's back, Bussell
suddenly split her legs wide apart in the air - and, though the move has
always been part of the choreography, this time it caused a gasp around the
New York State Theatre - the kind of gasp that was once part and parcel of
the sensational ballet Agon used to be at every performance.
In Symphony in C, where Bussell dances to the long exotic legato lines of
the second movement's oboe solo, it is easier to see what she has yet to
learn (and not only for Balanchine). She has a band of muscle across the top
of her shoulder blades that gives tension to her upper body just where it
needs relaxation. Sometimes this makes her neck look shorter than it is; and
seldom does it allow her to show the upper-body plasticity and epaulement
that is a vital part of both American and British classical style.
At her first New York performance, when she was partnered by a nervous
novice and showed occasional (atypical) signs of nervousness herself, she
tended to cut Balanchine's adagio choreography up into separate sections.
(Even in Agon, she should acquire more sheer connective impetus and
momentum.) Though her dancing radiates upwards and outwards into space, she
has not yet learnt how to make its horizontal lines beam sideways with equal
amplitude. (Suzanne Farrell - even more than the greatest Kirov dancers -
was so much the mistress of this that she seemed to be dancing in infinite
space.) And, though Bussell is never unmusical, she does not yet dance as if
she is her music's mistress.
Yet these performances of Symphony in C showed me more than ever before how
vast and beautiful Bussell's talent is. There is something extraordinarily
luscious about her style - the very pliant feet, the curvaceousness of the
slightly hyperextended legs, the lack of harshness - and this is combined
with a very sweet kind of innocence. The basic strength of her technique is
wonderful. And she really spreads her own aura, creates her own world out of
sheer dance, and she communicates her own delight in tackling the beauties
of this choreography.
Now, let nobody suppose that Bussell's success in Balanchine is a
vindication of the Royal Ballet in general. The Balanchinean virtues
possessed by Bussell are not shown by any other British dancer. During the
1990s, the Royal Ballet - perhaps largely in response to her immense talent
 -has been acquiring more Balanchine ballets than ever before. Balanchine
choreography shows, more clearly than anything else, that most British
dancers today do not fully coordinate upper and lower body. Few of them
dance, as does Bussell, from from a clear centre.
It is to be hoped that Bussell returns to New York City Ballet. This time,
she was simply dancing (and with little rehearsal) two of the nine
Balanchine roles she has already learnt in London. It may be that there are
other places - Miami, Seattle, San Francisco - where Balanchine style is
fresher than it now is in New York, but NYCB has many more roles, and many
finer points of style, that she can learn; and there is much that its
dancers can (re-)learn from her. Balanchine loved youthfulness, and it is
hard to believe he would not have adored Bussell's innocence. As Londoners
have had the chance to see for four years now, the more Balanchine Bussell
gets to dance, the more youthful she becomes.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Barbaric Branca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glenn Branca's Symphony No. 10 for massed electric guitars follows in a long
tradition of barbaric New York art. As an extension of the pleasure through
pain principle of sound sculpture exquisitely executed by the likes of the
Velvet Underground in the 1960s, or the pleasantly numbing hypnosis of
minimalists such as Reich and Riley, Branca's 'music' has found a suitably
uncomfortable place in the tasteful lofts of Manhattan.
In what might be described as the aural equivalent of auto-asphyxiation, the
slab of sound created by the rhythmic thrashing of eight guitars and a
brutal bass drum, starves the listener of melodic and harmonic oxygen on the
way to its cathartic conclusion. The first movement begins and finishes,
much like the other three, with an unremitting subway roar from the keyboard
and the ensemble's overamplified and crappy guitars screeching overhead at
speaker popping volume. By way of conducting, Branca stands with his back to
the audience shaking clenched fists at the 'score'. There is a pause for
restringing and the renewal of earplugs in the audience before the sonic
attack resumes.
At its best and most climactic, the listener has the calm feeling of being
in the eye of the storm as an almost Wagnerian chorus appears from the
vortex. At other times it is, as John Cage had it, fascistic and
totalitarian in its intensity. The last movements were cheerlessly subtitled
Final Problem and The Horror by Branca who, by the coda, was clawing at his
eyes and convulsing in a kind of spastic dance.
Is it any good? Yes, when it stops, to coin the old joke.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Into Europe, and What
Happens Next? (16): Other countries are privatising, too - Will public
flotations of state industries around the world tempt UK savers to diversify
their tax-free investments?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER

<TEXT>
PEPs have traditionally been sold as core investments, but some fund
managers argue that it is time that substantial investors introduced a
little diversification into their tax-free portfolios.
Those who have invested the maximum permitted amount into general and
single-company Peps since 1987 have now ring-fenced Pounds 46,200 from tax,
or nearly Pounds 100,000 if a husband and wife have both contributed their
full Pep allowance. And unless these investors have been very unfortunate
(or inept) the capital value of their Pep holdings is worth considerably
more than this.
Martin Harrison, GT's marketing director, says: 'Most Pep portfolios are
stuffed with UK income equities or UK blue chips. This is fine as long as
investors don't think that it is the end of the story. It is about time
people started to look at diversification.'
Judy Delaforce, Fidelity's manager of product development, agrees. She says:
'We are finding that people will always go first to their home market; but,
now that we have had six or seven years of Peps, investors are becoming
incredibly overweight in the UK, and we are seeing much more
diversification.' Fidelity's European funds are currently the second and
third most-favoured home for the group's new Pep money.
Since 1991 there have been two routes to Pep diversification. Investors can
move outside UK equities and into the Far East, or Japan or the US by
contributing the maximum Pounds 1,500 to a non-qualifying fund. More
satisfactorily, they can put the full annual contribution into a fund that
invests in EC equities.
Ken Emery, technical manager of investment products at Save &amp; Prosper, says
the argument for diversifying into Europe 'depends on how much money you
have put into your Pep, and how long you have been contributing. I think
one's first Pep investment should be a UK fund, but the ability to go into
European equities is certainly helpful in enabling people to spread their
investments rather more widely.'
There is no shortage of European unit trusts and investment trusts available
to enable investors to diversify. For example, Framlington is concentrating
part of its 1994 Pep marketing on its Continental Smaller Companies trust.
Fund manager Stephen Watson says: 'We have the possibility of interest rates
coming down further and of some economic growth. But the point we are trying
to emphasise is that, after three years of underperformance, smaller
companies could be due for a bounce back.'
New 'pepable' European investment vehicles are also appearing with some
regularity. GT, for example, recently launched a European Equity and Bond
fund which replicates what investors can do with a European Pep. The trust
will never have less than 45 per cent of its portfolio in European bonds, or
more than 55 per cent in European equities.
Harrison says: 'We believe that there is a big opportunity to persuade
people that they ought not to be limiting their Peps to UK equities, and
this fund has a zero investment in the UK. Europe is behind the UK in the
interest-rate cycle, so many domestic investors in continental Europe still
have money on deposit. We expect interest rates will fall in 1994 and that
these investors will start to look at equities.'
Harrison forecasts that the catalyst for a change in investment sentiment
will be the European privatisation programmes, which are already attracting
intense investor interest in the UK.
The two new European privatisation investment trusts, from Mercury Asset
Management and Kleinwort Benson, look set to attract more than Pounds 1bn
between them - Mercury had 65,000 inquiries to its share information office
before its public offer opened on February 3 - and Fidelity hopes to launch
a global privatisation unit trust shortly. All three funds will qualify for
Pep investments.
Jonathan Ruck Keene, director of Mercury Asset Management Private Clients,
says: 'Pep investors are part of the target market for the Mercury European
Privatisation trust. The Pep will contain warrants, so there is a slight
element of gearing in it, and that adds a little bit of spice.'
Recent estimates by JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley International
suggest that European privatisations totalling at least Pounds 100bn are
possible over the next five years.
France, Italy and Spain have already announced big privatisation programmes;
but Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts,
says: 'Almost all countries have potential privatisations: Ireland, Belgium,
Germany, Holland and Sweden and the former Eastern bloc countries. This is
an enormous market.'
White believes the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust Pep
will be 'particularly suitable for those who have a potential CGT
liability.' But he adds: 'It is not the first investment that one should
Pep. First, one should look at the high-yielding shares in one's portfolio.'
As with any Pep, too, basic-rate taxpayers must weigh up whether the tax
benefits will outweigh charges on the plan.
The ability to add European equities to a Pep has clearly widened investor
choice - as S&amp;P's Emery says, 'It is another refinement' - but few Pep
managers believe that there will be further substantial improvements to the
Peps scheme. Although there have been no innovations since 1991, they point
out that Peps have been generously enhanced since the fledgling scheme was
first unveiled in the 1986 Budget.
Some even fear that constant pressure for further concessions may prove
counter-productive. They suggest that misdirected lobbying for greater Pep
freedoms could combine with economic pressures to prompt the government to
look again at the revenue cost of encouraging savings through tax reliefs.
Emery says: 'I get incensed when people keep asking for increases in the
annual limit. I think it is very generous.'
However, there is considerable agreement among unit trust managers, at
least, that it would be helpful to investors if there was freedom to place
the whole of the Pep allowance in a gilt or bond fund. Fidelity's Delaforce
comments: 'This would make Peps more suitable investments for a bear
market.'
Lobbyists for this measure argue that gilts Peps could play a useful role in
assisting the government with the funding of its borrowing requirement.
For this reason, optimists believe that a relaxation on the use of gilts may
be the favoured option if the chancellor of the exchequer decides to enhance
Peps in his next November budget.

QUIET MOMENTS IN WAR: THE LETTERS OF JEAN-PAUL SARTRE TO SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR
1940-1963 translated by Lee Fahnestock and Norman MacAfee Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 25, 320 pages
If Jean-Paul Sartre had had been asked 'What did you do during the second
world war, Daddy?' by the child he never sired (though not for want of
trying), the answer would have gone something like this:
'I inflated red-coloured balloons and then launched them. I used them to
plot the direction of the wind. I would give wind-charts to my superior, an
officer in the artillery. What he did with them I've no idea; but, duty
done, I would return to the barracks to play chess or read a detective
story.'
Sartre might have confessed that his duties as a private in the
meteorological unit in Alsace of the French Army were so non-time-consuming
that he was able to do a great deal of writing as well. Until he was
captured in 1941 his wartime output was phenomenal.
He wrote the whole of The Age of Reason, the first volume of his
novel-sequence The Roads to Freedom in his leisure hours, plus 15 notebooks
(the surviving ones have been published as Notebooks From A Phoney War) in
which he sketched out theories derived from Heidegger and Husserl, the
foundation of his massive philosophical work Being and Nothing.
In addition, he wrote almost daily letters to his mother, his young mistress
Wanda Kosakiewicz, and to his mistress-companion, Simone de Beauvoir. Wanda
and her older sister Olga had been pupils of Beauvoir in Rouen before the
war. At that time Olga had become attached to Sartre and it was she who
inspired the character of the philosopher's girlfriend Ivich in Sartre's
novel. The sexual triangle formed by Olga was also used by Beauvoir in her
novel She Came to Stay. But now it was her sister Wanda who was Beauvoir's
young rival for Sartre's affections.
It is Sartre's letters to Beauvoir at this period that are published in
English translation as Quiet Moments in a War. Though the background is
familiar they add significantly to our knowledge of Sartre. His discussions
of work in progress alternate with richly ironic descriptions of daily life
in the unit, covering such topics as relations with his Jewish corporal,
intrigues to get a decent billet, and flirtations with the blowzy Alsatian
waitress in a cafe he always used for lunch. Then there is the tantalising
prospect of leave, continually postponed, and constant requests to Beauvoir
for money. As an impression of the futility that preceded the Fall of
France, observed from the Front line, the letters could not be bettered.
They complement the previous volume of his correspondence with Beauvoir
(from 1926 when they first met to 1939). Both volumes were published
together in French as Lettres au Castor et a quelques autres. Castor was
Beauvoir's pet-name always used by Sartre when writing to her. It means
'Beaver' in French and serves as a pun on her surname and her industry; but
it also refers to Castor and Pollux, the Heavenly Twins of classical legend,
and as such serves as an emblem of the relationship between Sartre and
Beauvoir. That relation caused her as much anguish as it did joy.
'You, my little Beaver,' he writes in March 1940, 'you who are me. I love
you so much'. He uses her throughout as an echo-chamber as he recounts in
great detail the current state of play with Wanda and the other women in his
life. We can see plainly the emotional double- and treble-life he was
leading, the deceptions it involved when he went on leave and had to
confront both women.
After the French collapse which Sartre refused to believe would happen, the
surviving letters are few. The book concludes with one or two written in New
York after the war. They reveal a rapidly spreading celebrity, and contain
news of fresh emotional entanglements. There is also an amusing description
of the John Huston menage in Ireland where Sartre stayed without Beauvoir
while working on the script of a film about Freud. The translation is
serviceable, the editing sparse.

A MOST DANGEROUS METHOD by John Kerr Sinclair Stevenson Pounds 25, 607 pages
In the late summer of 1904 an 18-year-old Russian girl called Sabina
Spielrein was admitted to the famous Burgh'lzli psychiatric hospital in
Zurich. She was alternately depressed and hysterical, obsessed with her
digestive processes and sexually fixated upon her father's hands. To all
efforts at help she responded with wild cries of loathing and disgust.
Within a few years Spielrein was having an affair with the physician
appointed to her care. She studied medicine and later practised as a
psychoanalyst, thereafter lecturing in the subject at Geneva's Rousseau
Institute.
In the psychotherapeutic world it is not unusual for patients to turn
healers. But this case was, says John Kerr, special; Spielrein's physician
was Carl Jung, and later she was a colleague and confidante of Sigmund
Freud. According to Kerr, her association with these two men played a
significant part in their relationship. It is this relationship and its
spectacular demise that is the subject of Kerr's book.
When they first met, Freud excitedly proclaimed Jung his heir. Six years
later he was apostrophising him as brutal, anti-Semitic, paranoid,
'emotionally stupid' and a sufferer from 'repressed anal eroticism'. Freud
was always incontinent in his hostility to those he perceived as apostates -
Alfred Adler furnishes another celebrated example - but with Jung his
vehemence barely knew bounds.
The Freud-Jung story is absorbingly told by Kerr, who in the process
introduces us - equally absorbingly - to both the substance and the
implausibilities of psychoanalytic theory. Of the two principals in the
drama, Freud emerges smelling least of roses; on Kerr's account he appears
mean-minded, jealous, self-serving, unscientific and prejudiced. On the
evidence marshalled by Kerr it seems hard to disagree. But Freud at least
was sane, which - on the same evidence - cannot be said so unequivocally of
Jung, whose bizarre visions and religious torments constituted the main
source of his theories. As a result, Kerr's account goes a long way to
weakening the claims on our intellectual respect of both Freudian and
Jungian psychology.
Freud and Jung met in Vienna in 1907. On their first encounter they talked
enthusiastically into the early hours. Freud was anxious to associate with
Jung, who already had a reputation in medical psychology, and was not a Jew;
these were both important attractions for Freud, who wished to make
psychoanalysis respectable by having it accepted in institutions outside
'sensual' Vienna where its leading exponents were all Jewish. A non-Jew from
prim Switzerland's best-known mental hospital seemed perfect.
And to begin with, Jung was happy to play Paul to Freud's Jesus. Their
collaboration started well; driven by Jung's energy, psychoanalysis began to
acquire international respectability. The two travelled to America together
to lecture, and Jung organised grand-sounding International Congresses of
Psychoanalysis in various European cities.
But Jung had too independent a mind to rest content with the role of second
fiddle. Driven by his own demons, he commenced to differ. As with Adler, a
chief disagreement concerned Freud's insistence on the importance of sex.
But there were increasingly many other problems. Freud was a determinist;
Jung believed in free will. Freud held that minds are individually shaped by
the forces of infant sexuality; Jung thought in terms of a universal
unconscious which can be understood through mythology. Freud concentrated on
childhood experience; Jung attached great importance to the middle and later
parts of life, which he believed to be dominated by religious concerns.
These differences began to emerge after their American trip in 1909, but it
was not until 1913 that the rift was complete. By the time of the Fourth
International Psychoanalytical Congress, held that year in Munich, the two
men were no longer on speaking terms. In the immediately following years
Jung had a species of nervous breakdown; Freud meanwhile vituperated him at
every opportunity.
This story is compelling enough without the introduction of Sabina
Spielrein. Although she is interesting in her own rather sad right, Kerr
does not succeed in showing that she had any real importance to the
Freud-Jung saga. Their quarrel had nothing to do with her. Kerr would have
us believe that she was, in effect, the pivot of a mutual blackmail: he
claims that Freud's knowledge of her affair with Jung - if affair it really
was - was Jung's reason for keeping to himself his knowledge about Freud's
incest with his sister-in-law, Minna Bernays. Kerr himself shows this
hypothesis to be implausible, reporting that many of the early
psychoanalysts, setting an honourable precedent no doubt, slept with their
patients. Why should Jung worry particularly? Moreover it is clear from
Kerr's account that Freud made desultory attempts to detach Spielrein's
loyalties from Jung, but failed. So she is a minor figure, used by Kerr
merely to give the story a novel perspective.
But the story is gripping nevertheless, and for its controversial
undermining both of psychoanalysis and its creators it makes an entertaining
and highly educative read - and perhaps an important one.

JACKO THE GREAT INTRUDER by Thomas Keneally Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99,
316 pages
Pop to the shops or let in the cat, and Thomas Keneally has got another
novel on bookstores' acquiescent shelves. How he churns them out. This is
his 22nd. In honour of the ice-dancing marks at the winter Olympics, I would
award Jacko The Great Intruder 5.7 for technical merit and 5.8 for artistic
impression - about the same as Torvill and Dean: bronze medal only, strictly
ballroom, Saga Holidays, Radio Gaga.
I exaggerate. But only because I like Keneally enormously, have read most of
his novels and wish he would slow his pace, stop the churning and present us
with - say - five superior novels in the time remaining to him rather than a
baker's dozen of hits and misses.
I met Keneally once. Bumped into him at an airport. He had just won the
Booker Prize. I grasped his hand. Thanked him for being him. Warmly, he
responded. He is small and turnip-shaped, eccentrically-bespectacled,
unsuccessfully-bearded, and dresses in the clashing pastels favoured by
Aussie businessmen. His eyes miss nothing. They atomise you while you stand
there, egregious in your fanship. He really is an artist.
But with Jacko The Great Intruder he burdens himself with a plot that is
wilfully testing, if not pixilated. Jacko Emptor, from Australia's medieval
Northern Territory, works for a New York TV station, Vixen Six, owned by a
shadowy Australian media-king (obviously Rupert Murdoch). Jacko is a
trespasser, barging into people's homes - including that of an ex-soldier
whose daughter has disappeared - on behalf of his show, Morning Manhattan.
Meanwhile, the plot keeps flipping back to Oz: to the Emptors' vast cattle
station (beautifully realised: see Keneally's non-fiction Outback for the
source of this material) and Sydney, where Jacko's family pursue their own
storylines. His brother, a gay opera-goer, has his hand in his company's
till, while Chloe, the Emptor matriarch, etched by Keneally with adoration
and vigor, is determined to engineer a meeting with Australia's Nobel
prize-winning novelist (obviously Patrick White: a splendid piece of
homage).
Meanwhile, back in New York, Jacko sets about tracking down the ex-soldier's
daughter, who may have been kidnapped. But there is trouble with the pacing.
No sooner have we got accustomed to switching between New York and Oz than
the plot lurches off to Germany, for the fall of the Berlin Wall.
This episode is so well-handled that we realise that Keneally would have
been better off producing a solid satire on the TV biz than interrupting his
story with outings among the cafe society of Sydney. At one point in Berlin,
Dannie, Jacko's fearsome female producer, admits that TV may be the domain
of clowns, but then spits back: 'Clowns, maybe, but we put the spin on the
direction history goes. We're putting the spin on it this afternoon. We make
up out of our own heads the way people feel . . .'
Make up out of our own heads the way people feel. How very good. What a
missed opportunity: what a pity that Keneally didn't go for the throat of
Rupert Murdoch and all the lesser monsters who breed in the video-ghetto. He
could have done it standing on his head.
Sceptre has republished Keneally's Schindler's List (paperback, Pounds 5.99)
to coincide with Steven Spielberg's film. Re-read that: save a tenner.

<TEXT>
THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES: MUSIC SCIENCE AND THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE
UNIVERSEby Jamie James Little Brown Pounds 18.99, 260 pages
The power of music over mankind, for dancing, fighting, love-making, praying
or mourning, is one of life's unsolved mysteries. Even cows are said to find
it soothing, while Brahms's spider was literally moved - charmed down its
thread by the composer's harmonies and sent scuttling up again by his
dissonances.
Various solutions to the riddle have been attempted. Deryck Cooke tried 35
years ago in The Language of Music to establish a musical grammar of human
emotions. More recently the psychiatrist Anthony Storr tackled it from the
psycho-biological end in his discursive Music and the Mind.
To describe the abstractions of music in words is notoriously difficult: so
it is not surprising that most music-lovers, and critics, are content to
leave it at that. But it is also a commonplace that science and music have
some affinity (think of all those boffins who play in string quartets), so
that when little Emily passes her Grade 5 piano with distinction the
neighbours exclaim: 'Oh, she must be good at maths]'
Therefore it is somewhat disappointing not to find in this present excursion
into the metaphysics of music any account of current scientific thinking
about why human beings react as they do when they hear certain tones or
rhythms or cadences. Nor are we left much the wiser about that extraordinary
combination of intellectual and emotional satisfaction which the playing and
hearing of 'good' music brings.
The author, an American magazine writer on both science and music, does,
however, trace the history of these phenomena right back to Pythagoras -
credited with discovering the mathematics of musical intervals - and his
cult of mystic number-crunchers. Through Plato, the early Christians, and
the Renaissance the cosmic character of music, the link between the universe
and the soul, went unchallenged. It was Galileo's father who broke the
Pythagorean spell when he discovered that the old Greek's ratios were not
perfect, and a vicious controversy ensued: some even said it against the
natural order to tune keyboards so that music could modulate.
Newton (an alchemist in his spare time) and Kepler (a keen astrologer) were
in thrall to the concept of the music of the spheres; while Leibniz, a
contemporary of JS Bach, said music was 'the hidden arithmetical exercise of
a soul unconscious that it is calculating.' This cosmic conception was only
dispersed by the anthropocentric Romantic movement, a period the author is
reluctant to define too sharply but appears, on balance, to regret.
The feverish cult of the virtuoso and genius gave way in turn to the atonal
Schoenberg, writing at the same time that Einstein was rewriting Newton's
physics. Even so Schoenberg (developer of the 12-tone system) could seem the
most mystical musician since Pythagoras. He was superstitious about the
number 13 (naturally) and displayed, says the author, a similar 'veneration
of the numinous power of number.'
James completes his tour with an essay on what he sees as the fragmented,
selfish sterility of the contemporary scene. Even here, he finds in
Stockhausen's account of the sympathetic and healing vibrations of music a
harking back to the time of Boethius.
This is a learned, sophisticated book, full of surprises. But it is not at
all clear what conclusion the author wants us to draw from his exegesis: he
is by no means anti-science, yetseems to be saying that music composed in
the cheerless, random world depicted for us by modern hypotheses is bound to
leave us cold and unsatisfied.
If so, he should talk to John Tavener.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Books: Liberal view of community politics - Malcolm
Rutherford reviews Paddy Ashdown's trawl through the Celtic fringe and inner
cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEYOND WESTMINSTER: FINDING HOPE IN BRITAIN by Paddy Ashdown Simon &amp;
Schuster Pounds 9.99, 206 pages
I first met Paddy Ashdown when he appeared as a spokesman for the British
Foreign Office at the Geneva talks following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus
in 1974. There was no compelling reason why he should be there. James
Callaghan, the foreign secretary, had brought along his own very able
spokesman, Tom McCaffrey, from London.
Lord Callaghan said long afterwards that he had no recollection of meeting
Ashdown at the time but, in the light of subsequent events, in British
politics, wished it had been possible for the future leader of the Labour
Party and the future leader of the Liberals to have had at least an exchange
of views.
Even then Ashdown was a restless figure, looking for something exciting to
do. He had left the Special Boat Section, the Royal Marines' equivalent of
the SAS, having learned Mandarin Chinese along the way, for the relative
calm of the diplomatic service. The Foreign Office appointed him first
secretary at the British mission to the UN in Geneva. Torn between a respect
for discipline and a desire for individualism, he remained a diplomat for
only five years.
It was not entirely surprising that he resurfaced as the Liberal MP for
Yeovil in 1983. He had checked the ground carefully and the old Tory seat
was plainly vulnerable. Besides, the Liberal party (now the Liberal
Democrats) was the only party that he could conceivably represent. Sometimes
dynamic, always romantic, usually on the fringe, Ashdown is firmly in the
postwar Liberal tradition.
The restlessness continued. Bored with Westminster politics after the 1992
general election, Ashdown decided to leave the House of Commons for two and
a half days a week 'in order to live and work with some of the different
communities in our country'. The result is this book.
Some of Beyond Westminster is very good. Ashdown writes well about local
communities; the more remote they are, the better the writing becomes. He is
at his best working on a Cornish fishing trawler in the Irish Sea, visiting
the Orkney and Shetland islands or staying on a farm in the Wye valley.
These are, incidentally, the areas from which Liberal votes have tended to
come.
Yet not all is Celtic fringe. Ashdown also went to the most depressed areas
of inner London, Liverpool and Manchester. The most heart-felt sentence in
his book is simply this: 'I had no idea what things are really like in
Peckham and Toxteth and Moss Side until I went to stay there.' One of his
findings was that 'no problem more affects the everyday life and freedoms of
people in this country than the rise and rise of criminality and the
breakdown of law and order'. He is particularly strong on the relentless
spread of drugs.
The book is sub-titled Finding Hope in Britain, but for all his professed
optimism the evidence is that Ashdown found very little of it. He came
across an effective crime reduction programme in Solihull in the West
Midlands; a viable First Stop Crime Shop, jointly funded by central and
local government and the police, in Peckham; and an old textiles firm that
had gone successfully upmarket in Suffolk. There are tales, too, of housing
cooperatives that work and local communities taking the initiative on
recycling waste. For the most part, however, Beyond Westminster is the story
of people battling against almost overwhelming odds. Government, local and
central, is the villain.
The geographical mix may have affected the judgment. Apart from the outlying
islands, Ashdown's only trip to Scotland was to visit the Monktonhall
colliery near Edinburgh - 'Britain's deepest pit and only operating mining
co-operative'. The north east of England was avoided altogether; so were
some of the more prosperous parts of the country. And a visit to Oxford is
surely worth more than specialising in the city's Gay and Lesbian Centre.
Thus it is almost as if Ashdown set out deliberately to look for minorities.
He is also full of nostalgia. 'Toxteth,' he writes, 'contains the oldest
black immigrant community in Europe.' A farmhouse in the Wye valley gives a
'powerful sense of being lived in century after century by people who drew
their strength from the ground'. Where he wants to innovate - through the
use of telecommunications - it is to help keep communities in remote areas.
All of which is admirable. Those from other political parties will note,
however, that Ashdown is sticking to community politics where the pressure
comes from the grass roots up. For the Liberals this has worked well
locally, but not yet nationally. In a few concluding pages, Ashdown offers
little more than the hope that people will work together; the old Liberal
stalwart of proportional representation is not even mentioned, let alone a
Lib-Lab pact. A breakthrough still looks distant.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Combined Bond-and-Equity
PEPs (15): A tax cherry in a portfolio cocktail - The savings industry
lobbied the chancellor for a Pep-like allowance for gilts or gilt funds, but
he did not oblige. Bethan Hutton examines the possible compromises available
to investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
The ideal portfolio for the typical private investor is usually said to
consist of a mixture of shares, fixed-interest securities and cash on
deposit. The proportions should vary according to your stage of life,
attitude to risk, view of the market, particular need for income or capital
growth, and so on.
So if a Pep is to be a central part of your portfolio, it would seem logical
for it to furnish more than one of these elements. However, the government
has other ideas. Personal equity plans, as their name suggests, are intended
to encourage equity investment, not to act as tax shelters for lower-risk
investments such as gilts or cash.
The savings industry lobbied the chancellor before the last Budget for a
Pep-like allowance for gilts or gilt funds, but the chancellor did not
oblige, and is unlikely to in the foreseeable future. The government's
priority now is to get people spending again, rather than encourage them to
save more.
Although a Pep cannot be used to invest solely in gilts or bonds, you can
get some exposure to them in combination with ordinary shareholdings.
However, two investment management groups (Foreign &amp; Colonial and Save &amp;
Prosper) ran into trouble last year, when the Inland Revenue decided that
funds they were marketing for inclusion in Peps were not eligible for Pep
investment, as less than 50 per cent of their assets were in the form of
shares.
The Revenue deemed that such funds could not be held in a Pep, even up to
the Pounds 1,500 limit for investment in 'non-qualifying' funds. Only funds
which were less than 50 per cent invested in bonds or gilts were 'pepable'.
The government's ruling has created the anomaly that a single fund can
invest up to 49 per cent in bonds or gilts and still qualify for Pep
investment; but an investor putting together a self-select Pep cannot
include any gilts, bonds or funds which are more than half invested in bonds
or gilts, even if the total holding of fixed interest securities within the
Pep is less than the regulation 50 per cent.
Curiously, although the Revenue has clamped down on using Peps to invest in
fixed-interest securities, it has not done the same for holdings of cash. At
the moment, there is no fixed limit on how much of your Pep can be held in
cash, or for how long, before you use the money to buy shares or units in a
trust. This is perhaps because cash is not an enticing prospect for
investors at the moment, due to low interest rates.
Shortly after the Revenue ruling on bonds, a number of other investment
management groups came up with pepable unit trusts designed to exploit the
50 per cent limit. The idea of a Pep which can combine bond/gilt and equity
investment is appealing to many investors, because it will tend to produce
more income than most funds invested solely in equities. For most people, at
least in the first few years, the main attraction of a Pep is the income tax
exemption, not the capital gains tax one, as relatively few people pay
capital gains tax.
There are four funds designed for Pep investment which fall into this
category: Cazenove Utility &amp; Bond fund, Fidelity High Income, Guinness
Flight Equity &amp; Bond Income, and M&amp;G Managed Income Fund.
The M&amp;G Managed Income fund, which puts together a selection of M&amp;G unit
trusts, including gilt funds, gets around the rule because it is a
fund-of-funds, structured as a unit trust in itself, rather than a Pep
wrapper around a mix of individual funds.
The other three trusts fall into the category of UK balanced funds - ie
those which hold a mixture of shares and bonds or gilts. Their main emphasis
is on income, but they do also offer the prospect of some capital growth.
They tend to invest in higher-yielding shares, such as utilities. Not all
balanced funds are suitable for Pep investment, as their holding of bonds
may slip over to more than 50 per cent.
Chris Burvill, manager of Guinness Flight's Equity and Bond trust, says: 'We
designed it very much as a Pep product. It is meant to be a low-risk fund.'
He sees the fund's advantage as offering a high yield, through investing in
high-yielding stocks and corporate bonds, but also presenting a lower risk
than a pure equity fund. At the moment, the fund has about 65 per cent
equities, and 35 per cent corporate sterling Eurobonds. The equity portion
was higher and is gradually being reduced.
The lower risk level of balanced funds is partly due to their defensive
capacity. Managers are able to increase the fund's weighting in equities
when the stock market looks set for a good run, then lock in growth by
switching back to more stable bonds when they feel shares are becoming
over-valued. This tends to mean, however, that capital growth is slower than
that of more equity-oriented funds.
Performance of the Guinness Flight fund was above average for the UK
balanced funds sector over the six months to February 1, ranking 16 out of
42 funds (source: Micropal). 'We are competing against funds which have up
to 80 per cent in equities, so if we can be half-way up in a very strong
bull run in the market, we should do quite well on the down side,' Burvill
says.
Cazenove's utility and bond fund did even better, ranking second overall in
the same sector, while Fidelity was at number 31. M&amp;G's Managed Income trust
was 17th out of 60 funds in the fund-of-funds sector.
John Spiers, of Best Investment, warns that some of these Peps have high
management charges, which he says are hard to justify. 'If you do want to be
conservative and go for this sort of fund, management charges are more
important than they would be for an equity fund,' he says.
For example, M&amp;G has an annual management charge of 1.5 per cent; Guinness
Flight's annual charge for the Pep is 1.25 per cent; Fidelity also charges
1.25 per cent; while Cazenove charges 0.5 per cent on the underlying unit
trust, and Pounds 30 plus VAT for the Pep from the second year onwards.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Gardening: Nice - but not quite what I asked for - Roy
Barnes on the trials and tribulations of mail ordering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year I decided I would like to create a reasonably colourful autumn bed
in a rather neglected shady strip at the edge of the lawn.
The previous year I had planted some Aster ericoides, Aster x frikartii
Monch, Dendranthema Clara Curtis and Lysimachia clethroides which had become
reasonably established. But the area was a tangle of old bush paeonies,
giant scabious, Acanthus spinosus and ground elder. All of which would need
pruning or clearing. I decided to replace them with white flowering plants.
The question was where to buy them.
I decided to try to obtain the new plants by mail order, as buying locally
was both time-consuming and not always successful. Being a novice, I had no
idea of the jungle I was about to enter.
If I were asked to offer advice to people like myself, about to embark on a
journey through the catalogues, one word would spring to mind: beware] The
differences in pricing, the quality of the goods, the standard of packing
and promptness of despatch (to say nothing of willingness or even ability to
answer inquiries) is astonishing. The route to happiness lies in not
expecting too much, preferably not expecting anything at all.
After extensive reading, I decided to restrict my purchases to four species:
Japanese anemones, dahlias, Kniphofia and digitalis. Having chosen my
varieties, I examined the price-lists of five suppliers - all reputable
well-known names, but varying from the small to medium-sized plant
'specialists' to the large national suppliers. I was immediately struck by
the range of prices asked for the same plant. The price of one variety of
Japanese anemone varied from Pounds 2.10 to Pounds 3.25 per plant. The
prices in the catalogue of the company asking Pounds 3.25 were from 75p to
Pounds 1.50 above all their competitors. I struck it off my list.
I put a selection of plant orders together and prepared to fill in the
forms. I now had to work out how much they wanted for postage, packing and
insurance. One company wanted Pounds 1 p &amp; p for each plant with no discount
for quantity. I removed it from my list. Some suppliers charge p &amp; p
according to number of plants bought, others by the value of the order.
Sometimes the system can work against the supplier's interest. What do you
do if Pounds 6 is charged per Pounds 75 worth of goods and you want Pounds
80 worth? Buy an extra Pounds 6 p &amp; p? No, you reduce your order.
Then there is VAT. Some sellers do not include VAT in their prices and some
do. The exercise became for me an intellectual puzzle: how to establish
value for money, and obtain the best buy for the minimum outlay.
To some extent, and to some people, particularly the experts, price is
secondary. One gardener told me that he had paid Pounds 5 for one seed of a
variety of a tree that he particularly wanted.
If you want a plant, you will pay the price. So it was with me for a giant
red Kniphofia, the order for which went off with the others to the supplier
at the start of February last year with a request for some enticing-sounding
Anemone tomentosa.
I heard nothing until the middle of March, when my three Kniphofia were
safely delivered (beautifully packed), but instead of the Anemone tomentosa,
came an apology and a token for Pounds 8.25. I rang to say I would prefer my
money back and was reminded that this grower did not refund sums of less
than Pounds 10 - why didn't I come and choose something else at their
nursery] It's only 60 miles away.
Every supplier understandably demands payment with order, and, of course,
the buyers' payments are tucked away in the sellers' deposit accounts until
he or she supplies. If they will not refund when they cannot deliver and one
cannot collect, presumably they have your money forever.
Moreover, if the plants arrive a long time after the order is placed, the
customers' money is a free loan. My last order, value Pounds 77.21, was
delivered on May 6, three months after it was placed.
In spite of the delay, I eventually set out my new plants. Some of them
bloomed. The Digitalis purpurea alba were 50 per cent purple; the six Little
Maid creamy dwarf Kniphofia did not send up a single flowering shoot; the
'Honorine' anemones looked lovely, but the Queen Charlotte turned out to be
much darker pink than I expected and there is no sign of a flower from the
Whirlwind semi-double white.
The 10 Eveline dahlias (which, according to the catalogue, should have been
creamy white with lilac-tipped petals) turned out to be scarlet streaks with
a white base and the Hayley Jane looks yellow to me. The slugs got
Kennermerland.
I am pleased with the colour effect, even though it is not what I planned.
It is not all the growers' fault; I was also pretty stupid, such as planting
a Eupatorium purpureum believing it to be a Eupatorium rugosum and sticking
three Dictamnus alba too close to giant dahlias, where they sulked and
refused to grow.
The catalogues, however, could be more helpful. You see a beautiful
illustration of a flowering shrub and know how lovely it would look in a
spot you have available for it - but the book does not tell you that it will
not flower for at least three years, during which time it will be making its
roots. Nor does the catalogue (or the nurseryman, for that matter) tell you
that those lovely gentians will pine away in your alkaline soil.
Some simple, truthful statements ought, it seems to me, to be an obligatory
part of the catalogue description.
I was grateful to the supplier who, when I wrote explaining that none of the
rather puny plants he had sent me had wanted to grow, wrote back and
apologised, saying it had been a bad year for propagating and refunded all
my money. I now trust him and will buy from him again.
The Plant Finder, published by Headmain in association with the Hardy Plant
Society (Pounds 10.99, 734 pages) contains more than 55,000 plant listings,
tells where they can be obtained and whether nurseries or plantsmen offer a
mail order service.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It was a peach of a day, all the more glorious for confounding expectation.
The man on the radio had forecast November dankness and chill. But as I
bowled along the Roman road that points at Salisbury, the flannel above
peeled away to reveal a soft, blue sky and a soft autumn sun. The wide, bare
spaces of the downs glowed, and the foliage of the oak and beech copses was
suffused with coppery life.
In short, it was grand to be out and about, with a fishing rod in the back
of the car and a long-held ambition to fulfil. As I rolled down in to the
Test valley, I spared a thought - being a compassionate man - for the
millions chained to their desks, eyes trained on screens, ears jammed to
telephones.
I reflected that the sweetness of the song of the birds, and the healing
quality of sunshine, were distinctly enhanced if you were the only one
around to enjoy them.
My ambition was to fish for grayling with a fly rod, in the grayling's true
season, which is autumn. I had caught them before in the UK, but always by
accident, when fishing for trout in summer. In such circumstances they are
something of an annoyance.
The grayling's reputation has never stood as high in England as in
continental Europe. The species is widely distributed, but it does best in
the southern chalk streams. And there - on the Test, Avon, Kennet etc - it
must compete with the trout for the angler's attention.
At best, the grayling has tended to be regarded with condescension,
occupying a position in the fishy world roughly equivalent to that of the
gentlewoman's companion in the human world. At worst, it has been the victim
of persecution by intolerant ideologues and ignorant snobs who think it
unworthy to share hallowed water with the noble trout.
The continentals are free from this absurd prejudice. On travels a few years
ago in eastern Europe, I found the grayling as highly esteemed as the trout,
or more so. The Poles and the Slovaks have developed specialised tactics for
catching them in the rivers of the Carpathians. Having watched a Polish
wizard whisk out a score of good fish in an hour and a half, I tried to
emulate him. But the control of two heavy nymphs while wading a foaming
mountain torrent was completely beyond me; and I retreated to the quiet
corners where I managed a grayling or two on a dry fly.
Now, on this November day, I was to try - courtesy of a kind friend and his
father - for English grayling on the Test at Timsbury. Fishing there in high
summer for trout, I had caught a couple of big grayling during a hectic
hatch of sedges. But in autumn the nymph was the thing - or so I had read.
There are nymph fishers and non-nymph fishers, and by inclination I am of
the second category. I like to see my fly on the surface. But the nymph
sinks, and for me the perennial problem with it is to tell when, and if, a
fish has taken it. As a rule it has not, but this is not a great deal of
use.
The experts tell you that you must watch the fish under water, and strike
when it opens its mouth to absorb the nymph. Now, there are doubtless men
keen-sighted enough to spot a pair of small, white lips opening and closing
through several feet of water. But I am not one of them.
The alternative is to watch your leader, and strike when it behaves
unnaturally. But I cannot see the leader either. So, employing a tip from a
pleasant young man in the tackle shop in Stockbridge, I tied on a piece of
orange wool treated with floatant. This was splendidly visible, and I spent
a considerable amount of time watching it bob down the current. It went
under but once. I struck, and nothing happened
I began to have doubts about the nymph. Luckily for me, the mellowness of
the weather encouraged an excellent hatch of olives, and I came across a
little shoal of grayling feeding keenly at the surface. I caught one
immediately on a dry fly, and a gorgeous sight it was, with its silver,
black-spotted flanks and bristling red-membraned dorsal fin. Aha, I thought,
I am going to make a killing. A series of clumsy casts then persuaded the
rest of the shoal to stop rising.
With the sun sinking fast, I went back to the nymph. And I had a fish at
once, even lovelier than the first - for it was bigger, a good 1 1/2 lb. I
could not bear to kill it, so I let it go. The lady of the stream is how
some felicitous writer dubbed the grayling; and I felt that, as a gentleman,
I had paid my respects.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Outdoors: Business sense that keeps communities together -
Village Shops / Derek Smith tells Clive Fewins how villages can keep their
stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early in 1991 the village shop at Halstock in Dorset closed at short notice.
There had been four owners of the business in 10 years and most of the
population thought Halstock would swell the ranks of villages which have
been losing their shops for good.
They had reckoned without the inventiveness of retired farmer Derek Smith.
He established that there was the will to retain the shop in the village,
formed an association, negotiated the lease of a semi-detached cottage in
the centre, and badgered village donors into raising Pounds 15,000 to pay
for the conversion of the ground floor and the stock needed to turn the
building into a shop.
For the first six months the enterprise was run by a volunteer from the
village. But for the past two years the business has been run at a profit by
tenant Brenda Erscott.
Unlike many other attempts to save village shops, the Halstock scheme has
been a success. Other rural communities have looked to it as a model
venture, and Smith, 62, has found himself touring the country advising
would-be saviours of village shops from Devon to Derbyshire.
At the beginning of last year he founded ViRSA, the Village Retail Services
Association, which he runs with the help of a part-time secretary and a
committee of volunteers from a rambling office at his farmhouse near
Halstock.
'The reasons for the decline of the village shop are debated endlessly.
Out-of-town supermarkets, the internal combustion engine and the uniform
business rate are all frequently cited,' Smith said. 'But what I repeatedly
say on my travels round the country is that these shops can be saved if
communities will get together and act.
'Very often parish councils do not realise what power they have. They are
able quite legally to raise up to Pounds 3.50 per household per annum under
the council tax rules, but all too often they don't have the drive. They
like to avoid local controversy. It's the old thing: in small communities
people don't like to make enemies.'
Smith pulls no punches when addressing meetings of villagers, usually called
when their village shop is about to close.
'The long-term problem I come up against, time and time again, is that of
the deeply indebted shopkeeper. My advice to these people is: don't be
brave: cut and run. Be frank with your parish council, for they are your
best hope of rescue. The council might be prepared to buy a stake in the
freehold, or enter into a shared ownership agreement, thus providing a form
of subsidy.'
The problem all too often, according to Smith, is that village shopkeepers
have paid too much for the freehold of their premises and have mortgages
they cannot sustain.
'If shopkeepers in shops in small villages with populations of 500 or less
had rents or mortgage payments of Pounds 50 a week or less they would
usually survive quite comfortably,' he said. 'Sadly rented shops are in a
minority. They usually only exist where there is a benevolent landlord.' At
Halstock Brenda Erscott pays the Halstock village shop association Pounds 60
a week rent for the shop. The association in turn pays rent to the owner,
making a small gain in the process. That gain, plus stock repayments from
Erscott and interest on the existing Pounds 8,000 in the association's
funds, means that from next month investors in the shop will be able to
start to reclaim their loans. Sums paid in by the 60 investors ranged from
Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,500. They were given no guarantee of a return on their
money.
'The view from the outset was that people should not put up money they could
not afford to lose. Although the payments were interest-free loans there was
always a good chance of recouping 50 per cent of the money even if the
business closed and the stock and fittings had to be sold off,' Smith said.
The shop's turnover last year was Pounds 100,000 and the net profit Pounds
3,665. Erscott is still in deficit because she has paid Pounds 12,000 of her
own money into the business. But the figures are increasing yearly and she
is able to compete with the supermarkets on the price of basic grocery
lines.
However, it's a tough life. Erscott, 62, opens from 7.30am to 6pm six days a
week and also on Sunday mornings. She has an afternoon off on Tuesdays and
employs two part-timers and one casual helper. Her wage bill is Pounds 100 a
week.
'It's hard work and would not really be worthwhile without my Post Office
salary of Pounds 4,000,' she said.
Smith has a number of 'key criteria' he lists when advising groups that wish
to rescue or restart a village shop. All tenants should have a minimum of
Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 12,000 in working capital, he says, and if the
building is to house a post office more may be needed. The catchment area
should have a minimum population of 500 (at Halstock it is 400 including an
adjoining shopless village) and minimum sales should be Pounds 70,000, with
potential for increase. The skill and personality of the shopkeeper is
another vital ingredient.
'I also point out that the landlord-and-tenant system, in which the village
owns the shop, is by far the best if it can be arranged,' he said.
'I regard reverse credit systems, in which individual customers provide cash
in advance for purchases, as often short-term and not getting to the root of
the problem. They often result in saving the shopkeeper but not the shop.
'Basically, if here is a population of close to 500 and a potential turnover
of Pounds 100,000 then a system like that at Halstock might work. If the
figures are lower it is best to kick off by running the business using
volunteers and see how it goes.'
That is exactly what is happening at the village shop at Tallerton near
Honiton in Devon, where the shop, which had been in the same family for
three generations, closed last October. The villagers have raised Pounds
6,500 in loans and grants, and the shop reopens on February 22, staffed by
volunteers.
'Once the long-term tenancy is secure and if all goes to plan we shall
consider seeking a tenant to run the business,' said farmer John Carter, the
parish council chairman.
The villagers at Manaton, an isolated village on the edge of Dartmoor, hope
to follow suit. Their shop closed last September. They plan to lease the
shop premises from the widowed owner and former shopkeeper and initially to
run the business using volunteers.
Smith is sceptical about community shops, or enterprises run permanently by
volunteer labour, of which he estimates there are some 20 in the country.
'A lot have failed or are failing because they are understocked and
out-of-date in their methods,' he said.
ViRSA's next task is to create a database of essential details of all the
6,000 or so village shops in the country that serve populations of under
1,000.
'We want to try and find out as much as possible about the health of these
businesses and to let them know we are here to help if there is a crisis,'
Smith said.
ViRSA is a non-profit-making association and relies on the generosity of
individuals and organisations wishing to support the cause of village shops.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Profile (14): An
unwieldy name that carries weight in the city - Is the Henderson-Touche
Remnant marriage working? John Authers reviews its first year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henderson Touche Remnant is now Britain's leading investment trust group.
However, it acquired that title by merger, when the Henderson and Touche
Remnant groups came together at the end of 1992, and it has spent the past
year trying to justify and consolidate its title.
trusts have kept their boards and fund managers intact, this has not proved
difficult. TR included a number of well-established 'gems', whose
performance remains consistent and impressive.
This explains the new group's decision to trade under all three names. It is
an unwieldy brand name, but for the time being it carries weight both in the
City and with small investors, and dealers seem happy to abbreviate it to
HTR.
Merging the two businesses has not proved easy. 'The first priority was to
get the people and systems under one roof, which we achieved by March 31,'
explained Mr Alan Gadd, marketing director for HTR. 'Secondly, we
established overall business plans, so we needed a coherent view of the
market.'
Fortunately, the managers of most of the old TR range of investment trusts
had strategies that were different from those of their new Henderson
colleagues, and there was no need for complicated trust mergers. On the unit
trust side, however, there were several mergers - although this is a much
simpler operation with open-ended funds.
Last year, the new company was well-enough established to launch its first
new investment trust, a Japanese smaller companies fund. It was
oversubscribed, and raised its target Pounds 100m.
However, the company's Peps concentrate on the more traditional investment
trust sector. Its most eye-catching funds tend to take a very conventional
but successful, investment approach.
Bankers Trust led the esteemed International General sector for three-year
performance at the beginning of this year, with growth of 173 per cent. Over
seven years, it is second with growth of 253 per cent. Its fund manager, the
eclectic Michael Moule, remains popular with institutions, and the fund now
has the opportunity to rival better-known trusts in its sector, such as the
Alliance trusts and Foreign &amp; Colonial.
TR City of London, an income fund, and TR Smaller Companies have also
maintained consistent long-term records, and consistent popularity with the
market, with TR City shares usually trading at a premium to net asset value.
Extra shares are now issued for investors who either buy Peps or savings
plans, allowing the fund managers extra capital.
However, pricing the group's new range of investment trust Peps has proved a
problem, because Henderson and TR tended to work in different markets. While
Henderson worked primarily through independent financial advisers, most of
whom required a commission, TR concentrated on institutions, and individual
direct shareholders.
The new range of Peps reflects this. The Henderson Touche Remnant Investment
Trust Pep offers five separate trusts - TR City, TR High Income, Witan,
Lowland and Henderson Highland - with an orthodox charging structure for
intermediaries. The initial charge is 3 per cent, with a transaction charge
of 1.25 per cent, and annual charges of 1.25 per cent.
Fee-charging advisers should be prepared to rebate the 3 per cent
commission; but cost-conscious investors may be more interested in the TR
Smaller Companies Pep, which has no direct charges to the investor, all
costs, including stamp duty, being absorbed by the board (so charges might
still impact on overall investment performance). TR City of London Pep, also
aimed more at direct investors, has no initial charge, a transaction charge
of 1.0 per cent, and annual management charges of 0.75 per cent for balances
up to Pounds 6,000, and 0.5 per cent for balances higher than this.
Charges on the Witan Pep, the flagship of the old Henderson range, have
recently been altered to attract wealthier investors. Annual management
charges are now fixed at Pounds 30, rather than the old 1 per cent. Each
transaction costs 1 per cent, and there is no initial charge.
Witan has kept its international content low enough to remain 'pepable',
unlike several other trusts in the international general sector, including
Foreign &amp; Colonial. However, this may have affected Witan's performance over
the past year, as it lay 15th out of 20 in its sector for performance during
1993 (with 36.2 per cent growth), and 13th over seven years, on growth of
155 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Property: Sales figures suggest a January thaw - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
January figures from the Corporate Estate Agents property index, based on a
survey of 4,200 offices making up about half the UK estate agency market,
show a good start to 1994. Net completed sales, at 31,100, were 118 per cent
up on December 1993, if marginally down on January 1993, and gross sales
(those which have been agreed and should be proceeding) were 67 per cent up
on December 1993. Both figures reflect buyers' increasing optimism.
* * *
In London's Docklands, Savills has sold the last apartment at New Crane
Wharf, E1. Marketing of the 142 flats began almost six years ago at the top
of the market and the final one went for Pounds 260,000, with two other
buyers chasing it. The price in May 1988 was more than Pounds 500,000.
Information from Winkworth in St John's Wood, north London, shows how the
market is turning. Over the past year, the firm has sold three
three-bedroom, two-bathroom flats on the Queensmead Estate, NW8, which are
almost identical in size, layout and condition.
One, for which the asking price in February 1993 was Pounds 275,000, went
for Pounds 250,000. The second sold in August for Pounds 280,000 (asking
price Pounds 295,000) and the third earlier this month for Pounds 315,000
(asking price Pounds 310,000).
* * *
The black and white Cruck House in Eardisley, 15 miles from Hereford, was
built around 1400 and is the ideal of a country cottage which its owners -
Weekend FT readers David and Margaret Gorvett - are selling themselves. The
price is Pounds 118,500 (call: 0544-327- 529). Last year, Eardisley started
its own night patrols against burglars, who have vanished.
* * *
Three unusual properties are on offer. Jackson-Stops in York (0904-625-033)
has a converted Norman chapel with an 18th century brick tower. It is St
Oswald's Hall, now a three-bedroom house, in Fulford, 1 1/2 miles from the
centre of York, and it costs Pounds 185,000. The churchyard has become the
garden.
At Church Cove, on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, GA Property Services
(0326-316-362) is selling three buildings that were used as a lifeboat
station between 1885-99. The Boat House, the Winch House and the Round House
are priced from Pounds 59,000 to Pounds 75,000 - which looks spectacular
value for being beside the sea.
For those not averse to going underground, there is Mole Manor at
Westonbirt, Gloucestershire. As its name suggests, it is burrowed into the
ground ('earth-sheltered' is the technical term). The core of the building
is a round, domed atrium lit by natural light.
Noise insulation is excellent, energy use is low and the house stays dry and
warm; indeed, it cannot freeze. Cluttons in Bath (0225-469 - 511) is asking
Pounds 250,000 for this rare creation, built in 1987. The owners so enjoy
the hibernatory life that they intend to build another like it.
* * *
The Land Registry and the Department of the Environment have produced a
pamphlet called 'Public Information about Land and Property - and Where to
Find It.' It deals with information on houses and property held by public
bodies (excluding local authorities) in England and Wales. It is available
at public libraries, citizens' advice bureaux and district land registries
or from Alan Pemberton, HM Land Registry, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A

FT  26 FEB 94 / Property: The extra value of Oxbridge - Gerald Cadogan finds
plenty of attractive houses available in the old university towns - at a
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What unites Oxford and Cambridge? 'Merton land' used to be the answer. You
could walk from Oxford to Cambridge on land owned by Merton College, one of
the colleges which makes up Oxford University. When you reached Cambridge,
the first building was Merton Hall, where the late Lord (Victor) Rothschild
lived.
In today's property world the reply would be that they are exceptional
provincial cities, both within an hour of London. That makes them ideal for
commuting, and ideal to stay put in.
The resulting premium on property prices is perhaps more marked in
Cambridge, where there are fewer surrounding villages with fewer houses from
which to commute into Cambridge. That reflects the difference between the
Cambridgeshire flatlands, which were unusable fens until recently, and the
Oxfordshire hills and valleys, crammed with villages which once lived off
sheep and wool.
In both cities agents have clients clamouring for houses of character. It is
hard to find homes, especially since many of the best belong to the
colleges.
School-level education is a serious matter in Oxford and Cambridge, as I
know as an Oxford parent, and John Patten, the Education Secretary, knows as
one of the MPs for Oxford. People move to Oxford so that they can send their
children to the Dragon preparatory school as day pupils. Oxford High School,
for girls, accepts only a third of the applicants for the senior school,
where fees are an attractive Pounds 1,152 a term. For boys at senior level,
Magdalen College School is high in the Weekend FT school tables.
Likewise, in Cambridge, education is the essence of the city. The names here
are the Perse (schools for boys and girls) and The Leys plus, as in Oxford,
excellent state schools - no surprise in view of the parents - and two very
good sixth form colleges. The polytechnics in both cities have been promoted
to universities.
The other pluses the cities share are good medicine, masses of music,
theatre, bookshops, art cinemas, a rich variety of places to worship and an
articulate citizenry (which makes for marginal parliamentary elections in
both places). And they each have a fabulous university.
Do they differ? Yes, Oxford's train service is probably better and its
station is closer to the town centre. Parking the car I find impossible in
Cambridge, but I do not know the city well. In Oxford I have a spot where I
usually get in - which I shall not reveal.
Many eager buyers ensure an Oxbridge premium in house prices. And since
there are not enough medium-to-large houses for the dons and other
professionals, they spill over into the old working class terrace housing.
In Oxford, live in Victorian / Edwardian North Oxford if you can, or in the
old parts of Headington and Iffley. But if you cannot find a house there, or
want something more modest, then turn - as many do - to the old terrace
houses for printers in Jericho close to the Clarendon Press. Jericho's
attractions include the synagogue, a Lebanese restaurant and an art movie
house.
In Cambridge the market has turned. It fell 40 per cent from 1988 to early
1993, but buyers are now offering the guide price for two-and- three bedroom
Victorian and Edwardian terrace houses. First- time buyers prefer them to
the modern starter homes, says Nicholas Redmayne of Redmayne Arnold &amp;
Harris. For 42 St Barnabas Road it has bids above the guide price of Pounds
175,000, and with Carter Jonas it offers 106 Huntingdon Road, at the end of
a terrace of five houses, built probably in 1899, for Pounds 198,000. Fern
House, Prospect Row, is a simple Regency house from the company for Pounds
150,000, and usefully central.
Also central are the flats in Beaufort Place built in 1984 beside the river
Cam. Carter Jonas offers Nos 20 and 28 for Pounds 159,500 and Pounds 165,000
and Bidwells No 49, a penthouse, for around Pounds 250,000. No 7 Boathouse
Court is a town house in another new development on the river, from Bidwells
for Pounds 220,000.
The main shortage is in houses in the Pounds 250,000-Pounds 350,000 range,
says Jock Lloyd-Jones of Bidwells. Two that he has are The Birches (red
brick Victorian) in Cavendish Avenue for Pounds 350,000, and the Victorian
Bridge House in Great Shelford four miles from the city centre for Pounds
295,000.
In Oxford, I would love to live in Beaumont Buildings, a quiet side street
with smart brick houses off St John Street, in the centre of town. The
covered market and all the shops, colleges and libraries are in easy walking
distance. John D Wood is selling 3 Beaumont Buildings with four bedrooms and
one or two studies (or a fifth bedroom), and off-street parking (a valuable
plus), for Pounds 450,000. I should also like Osney Island, the 'village' on
an island in the middle of the city, off the Botley Road, close to the
railway station. Here the end of terrace 22 Bridge Street is for sale from
George Pearce for Pounds 75,000. Also attractive is the Georgian Lucia House
in the old village of Iffley. It costs Pounds 220,000 from Chancellors. 71
Great Clarendon Street, a terrace house in Jericho is Pounds 95,000 from
Cluttons.
Just outside Oxford lies Kidlington, a dull suburb except for the old part
around the church which includes the Old Vicarage, a 16th century grade II*
house. Carter Jonas is selling it for Pounds 350,000. Jackson-Stops offers
Lincoln Farm in the High Street of Standlake for Pounds 260,000, and Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley has Highcroft House in Eynsham for Pounds 475,000. Both are
grade II.
Looking out on the Thames is 66 Thames Street, a two-bedroomed new town
house near Folly Bridge, from Chancellors for Pounds 115,000. In Headington
56 Old Road, a five- bedroom family house, built in an eclectic style that
combines the tile hanging tradition of Sussex with a touch of an Edwardian
boathouse, costs Pounds 300,000 from Carter Jonas. New on the market from
the same agent is the imposing Queen Anne-style Bow House in Jack Straws
Lane for offers of more than Pounds 445,000.
In North Oxford, hymned by Sir John Betjeman, properties are scarce.
Consider then 86 Cunliffe Close, a town house for Pounds 207,500 from Adkin
or Cluttons. It is a healthy walk to good food and wine at the Cherwell Boat
House restaurant, where you can drink a toast to the team that wins the
Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in London next Saturday.
Further information in Cambridge (STD code 0223): Bidwells (841842); Carter
Jonas (68771); Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris (323130); Savills (322955).
And in Oxford (0865): Adkin (310300); Carter Jonas (511444); Chancellors
(724881); Cluttons (793900); Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (790077); George Pearce
(246502); John D Wood (311 522). Jackson-Stops is in Burford (0993-822661).

FT  26 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The man with 4,000 tricks up his
sleeve - Keith Wheatley on a magician whose customers sign a pledge of
secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend a few tricks will be pulled in Blackpool. Four thousand
magicians from around the world are gathered in the northern seaside resort.
Do not try to attend. The conjurers and prestidigitators are there for a
trade fair, not to tell the public how the rabbit appears from the hat.
Ian Adair expects to be the biggest-earning exhibitor. His company, Supreme
Magic, operates with discretion from the Devon port of Bideford selling
tricks to the trade. The client list consists of 20,000 customers in more
than 80 countries. Each must sign a confidentiality clause, promising never
to reveal secrets of the craft, before he is allowed to purchase so much as
three egg cups and a dice.
Reticence is endemic in this business but Adair agrees that turnover is more
than Pounds 1m and growing. There are more than 4,000 products in the
Supreme Magic catalogue. 'I suppose the dearest stock item is the Triple
Levitating Chair at just over Pounds 4,000,' said Adair.
After 35 years in Devon, he retains the accents of his native Kilmarnock.
'Our cheapest are small hand-tricks, as we call them, for just Pounds 10 or
so. We aim to be the Woolworths of magic, not some exclusive little
boutique.' Nevertheless, famous magicians such as Paul Daniels buy equipment
for tricks from Supreme Magic.
The US is the company's biggest market, but the former Iron Curtain
countries have always been a strong source of business. Even in the Cold War
these customers could conjure hard currency from somewhere.
Supreme Magic was founded 41 years ago by Edwin Hooper, a part-time
Punch-and-Judy man on nearby Woolacoombe Sands. With a Pounds 100 loan from
his plumber-father he rented a single room and began to manufacture and sell
tricks, but always to professionals, never through high street joke shops.
'He was fantastically inventive. He didn't make the tricks but devised them
and then found first-rate craftsmen to make them,' said Adair, who became
the company's first employee in 1958.
There are now 13 despatch and administrative staff but the manufacture is
still contracted out, much of it locally. The large warehouses behind the
modest offices contain a bewildering variety of stock. Beautifully lacquered
cabinets with false floors vie for space with packs of doctored playing
cards. Books of the 'How to . . .' variety are a large component of the
stock. Adair is a practising magician on the local summer circuit and a
prolific author. The 10-volume Encyclopaedia of Dove Magic is his magnum
opus.
'I love performing and I just feel that without being in front of an
audience regularly you're not going to know what your customers need,' said
Adair. 'It's the audience that changes, far more than the tricks.'
One of the most successful innovations has been two-part instructional
videos. Stars such as Daniels perform part of their act in front of
audiences of children at a television studio. That is part one. In part two,
the magicians reconstruct their tricks in minute detail. Production costs
for a one-hour tape are about Pounds 8,000 including a flat fee rather than
a royalty for the artiste. They retail for Pounds 30. The more successful
have sold more than 1,000 units.
Hooper died two years ago. His executors sold the business to outside
investors. Adair and his small team of inventors remain the core of the
company, but not the owners.
'It was a bit of a shock after so many years building up a biggish business
to find you didn't own or control any of it,' said Adair, a shy man when
caught without a wand or a dove in his hands. 'But I was finding the
administration and paperwork of running the business an increasing worry and
now I'm still doing what I love.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / As They Say In Europe: Life is exotic in the modern Sparta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Why are public services in Britain so bad compared with France?' asked
Monique Villa, who runs the London bureau of Agence France Presse. 'Is the
difference in taxation so great?' Such is the stuff of debate chez Morgan.
(On the agenda was not only a comparative study of systems of public
administration, there was also consideration of the development of the
Florentine aesthetic and whether British MP's are worse than others at
keeping their trousers on.)
As a share of gross domestic product, the French government takes 25 per
cent more in tax than does the British. Maybe things will change when the
British are hit by April's rises. But will Britain's public services be as
efficient as France's? Clearly not.
That made me think. The efficiency of a public service is judged by the
standard of service to the consumer. So British Rail is inferior. So
Britain's health service is worse than the French, where waiting times are
unknown and hospitals are fully staffed. But in Britain 94 per cent of all
health bills are met by the state; in France the figure is 77 per cent, so
the French pay extra as 'consumers.' And health spending absorbs a far lower
share of national resources in Britain than it does in France. Among the
results is a shorter life expectancy for the British - 1 per cent shorter.
But maternal death rates are lower.
British Rail may seem user-unfriendly but, in terms of exploiting its
resources, it is a world leader. Track and rolling-stock use is something
foreigners come to marvel at. It has not produced a catastrophe to compare
with the computerised booking system for the French high-speed trains.
What exists in Britain is a de facto utilitarianism. A basic service is
provided at a marvellously low price, in tax terms. This is reflected in
comparative UN criteria on the quality of life: Britain ranks only just
below France and the Netherlands.
What is missing is what Monique saw as those little touches that make people
feel better. They do not appear in the utilitarian calculus but they are
highly valued by ordinary people. The economic cost of late-running public
transport systems, of a six-month wait for a hip replacement, of a shortage
of nursery school places, may not be all that great. But full provision in
such areas adds to national well-being.
Britain is a sort of latter-day Sparta. The government does nothing to make
people feel better, British public services are a form of hardship. But in
economic terms they are amazingly cost-effective.
As I pondered these conclusions, I saw the fifth in a series of articles in
Le Monde on Europe's great cities. Last weekend the paper had a go at
London. The concern was architecture (I can already feel English readers
cringing in anticipation of the steady raining of superior Gallic blows on
vulnerable Anglo-Saxon heads.)
'English architecture of the post-war years and up to the 1960s was of a
singular quality compared with continental output,' began one paragraph
menacingly. Surprisingly, what followed was not a stream of abuse, but an
account of how things had improved in recent years. The writers liked
Chelsea hospital and the new international terminal at Waterloo station.
One observation ran: 'The Thatcher years, having opened the doors to the
angels and demons of savage liberalism, everything which smacked of state
intervention or of a strong local collectivity was banished.' But British
experts stressed that this was always so, London always grew by private
initiative. (By comparison Paris was destroyed by Haussmann more than 100
years ago in a grand project which uprooted and destroyed whole
communities).
The writers were intrigued at the way the government had eventually been
forced to intervene in the case of bankrupt Canary Wharf and build a metro
link to the beleaguered development to the east of the city. So it is that
London offers 'no simple logic but rather an ensemble of minimalist
characteristics.' There are no safeguards for zones of architectural
interest, only for individual buildings. But on the other hand consultations
with the people are 'far more extensive and demanding than on this side of
the Channel,' said Le Monde's experts.
The title of the piece was 'die-hard eclecticism' which really sums up
Britain. Not only London, but the social and physical infrastructure of
Britain grows incrementally. No grand projects, just tinkering with the
system. France is created from the ground up. It works better, costs more
but does it represent a better use of resources?
As Monique tells young recruits, for all the above, and other, reasons: 'If
you want to see a country that is very near and really exotic, go to
England.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Single-Company PEPs
(13): Not for the first-timer - Availability is different from suitability,
observes Alison Smith. The tax benefit may not always be worth the
additional risk for the small investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it worth putting all your eggs in one basket, even if the chancellor
encourages you to do so?
The chancellor's encouragement might in itself be enough to deter many
people from any course of action, but in terms of the Inland Revenue,
single-company Peps are a free gift, an added bonus.
Apart from the general Pep tax allowance of Pounds 6,000, there is a special
allowance of Pounds 3,000 plus charges if you invest in a Pep made up
entirely of one company's shares.
The idea was introduced by Norman Lamont in his 1991 budget, as another move
in the government's campaign to create a nation of share-owners. They were
devised primarily for employees who received shares through a share option
scheme - giving them a perpetual tax shelter - but are available to anyone
who chooses to take one out.
Availability is different from suitability, however. There is a real
question whether the extra tax benefit is worth the additional risk for the
small investor of choosing just one company.
Chase de Vere, the independent financial adviser which publishes an annual
Pep guide, is not alone in believing that normally it is worth considering a
single company Pep only if the general Pep tax allowance has been fully
used.
The process of taking out a single-company Pep can also involve more stages
 -and more decisions - than might be expected.
Someone working in a company and moving from an Inland Revenue-approved,
all-employee share scheme can move their shares straight into an SCP,
provided that this is done within 90 days of the shares emerging from the
scheme.
Qualifying new share issues, which are generally available, also allow any
investor to transfer straight into a single-company Pep, as for a general
Pep, provided they do so within 42 days of the allotment letter.
But in all other cases, the procedure of turning one company's shares
already held into an SCP is more complicated. The nearest equivalent is to
sell an existing holding, put the proceeds into an SCP, and tell the
investment manager to buy the same amount of of the same stock.
Even this approach could leave the investor vulnerable to capital gains tax
on the sale of the shares, as well as giving rise to dealing costs.
Then there is the question of which type of SCP to choose, as well as which
company. There are two broad varieties: those which are solely for one
company; and those where either the investor or the investment manager
decide which company to put the money into.
Not all Pep plan providers offer all kinds of SCPs. Bradford &amp; Bingley
building society, one of the leading independent Pep providers, for example,
offers over 60 different single-company Peps, but for each of them just one
company is specified, and there is no discretionary ability to switch.
Then there is the question of charges.
Many company schemes are cheaper than taking out an SCP through an
independent Pep plan manager, though extra charges would be incurred by
investors deciding after all that they did not want to hold a particular
stock forever, and wanted to change to another company.
Bradford &amp; Bingley has uniform fees for its single-company Peps. The initial
charge is Pounds 15 plus value added tax, though in some cases this is paid
by the company. Its annual charges are 0.5 per cent plus VAT, in some cases
with a minimum of Pounds 5, and it makes no charge for early encashment.
Though not quite the cheapest, at 0.25 per cent, its dealing charge is at
the low end of the scale.
Most independent Pep plan managers offering an SCP have front-end charges in
the 0.5-1.5 per cent range, with an annual charge of 0.75-1.5 per cent
thereafter. Dealing charges can rise to around 1.90 per cent.
Single-company Peps where the fund manager chooses which stock to invest in
can tend to be cheaper than those where the final decision is left to the
investor, whatever the manager may advise.
In the end, however, provided that the investment is in a stock where the
yield is high enough to cover the charges, the decision whether to take out
an SCP rests on broader issues than differences in percentage points on
fees.
'SCPs are not for somebody who has decided to venture into the stock market
this year for the first time and take out Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and
Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep,' says Brian Tora, of stockbrokers
Greig Middleton. 'That amounts to putting one-third of your investment in a
single company, which many investment managers say would be a high-risk
strategy.'
Robin Bloor, of Chase de Vere, takes a similar view. 'If you would not
normally put Pounds 3,000 into a single company, there's no point in doing
it just to be tax-free,' he says.
Many investment managers would advise an investor not to have more than 10
per cent of a portfolio in any one company, suggesting that someone with
investments of under Pounds 30,000 should perhaps be cautious about taking
out an SCP.
Others would put the case even more strongly, arguing that the real
advantage of SCPs lies in the shelter from capital gains tax, perhaps
implying a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 or more.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Grounds for turning over a new leaf - Giles
MacDonogh says it is time to start reading the tea leaves a lot more
carefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems that Britons need a refresher course. It is not quite 45 years
since the British left India and they have already forgotten the difference
between good tea and bad.
Between 80 and 85 per cent of what Britons drink today is CTC (crush, tear
and curl) tea from Africa and Latin America. This tea is harvested
mechanically and made by a special process which is designed to coat the
leaves with the darkest juices in order to provide a tea which will colour
up in the shortest period of time. In short, it is perfect for tea bags.
Nor has Britain reached the bottom of the spiral of decline. The better
brands, such as Lyons and PG Tips, which still use a small percentage of
'orthodox' teas, are being squeezed out of the market by cut-price own-label
teas available from supermarkets. The tea inside the sachets is of the
poorest quality imaginable. But even those wretched brews may be superceded
by tea granules, which make tea by a process identical to instant coffee.
The Indians are partly to blame. In the post-colonial years they played a
game of cat and mouse with the British brokers, imposing restrictions and
pushing up prices. The result was that the British simply looked elsewhere.
One source told me that at the beginning of 1978 the Indians were still
supplying Britain with 70 per cent of its needs. By the end of the year the
figure had dropped to 30 per cent. Leaving aside the Chinese and the Sri
Lankans - whose teas are still referred to as 'Ceylon' in the trade - the
world's most prestigious tea gardens are to be found in north-eastern India;
in Darjeeling and Assam, in the foothills of the Himalayas.
There, the tea bushes find the right combination of altitude, heat and damp
to ripen the leaves to perfection. Only the downy bud (or pekoe) and the
first two leaves are picked. The first two crops or flushes are deemed the
best. The Germans and the Japanese fight over the first, the British content
themselves with the second.
In Darjeeling and Assam there is a hierarchy among the tea gardens
reminiscent of the cru system in force in the better French vineyards. In
Darjeeling, for example, gardens such as Castleton, Margaret's Hope,
Jungpana, Seeyok, Selimbong and Goomti are considered to be consistently
excellent. Others occupy the second rank: sometimes, but not always, good.
Not all the gardens are Indian owned. Even Brooke Bond, I am told, has a bit
of land in India.
Until recently I should have been at a loss to tell you where - apart from
Harrods and Fortnums - these famous teas might be obtained. Now, however, I
can disclose some, if not all of the story. Operating from an office in
central London are the Sethia brothers of Newby Enterprises. The Sethias
have hit on the brave idea of bringing single-estate Darjeeling and Assam
teas to a wider British market. The Sethias buy their tea at auction in
India and have it packaged there for shipment to Britain and the US. The
cost of teas from the most expensive tea gardens limits their choice to some
degree: they cannot afford Castleton or Margaret's Hope; but they can and do
buy teas from Jungpana, Seeyok, Selimbong and Goomti, among the best
Darjeelings. The teas are unblended, but the names of the estates are not
written on the caddies. There is just a number code. I think this is a
mistake: it would be nicer to know precisely where the tea came from.
The Sethias made me a pot of Darjeeling, Goomti, as it turned out. I was
interested to hear them say that for a tea purist it was far worse to see
someone put lemon in their tea than milk. Most British brokers choose darker
teas precisely because they 'milk up' better than the paler ones.
I could not find the elusive 'Muscatel' character which is meant to typify
Darjeeling, but recognised a certain peachiness which they said was a good
sign. To prove their point, however, they took me off to Sir John Lyon House
in the City to meet Edward Foster, a tea broker. Foster guided us into a
long room with many drawers full of tea and little pots of Newby tea were
brewed alongside some of their commercial rivals.
Foster was not unduly upset by the lack of Muscatel. 'It's a rare bird', he
said. He said the Newby Darjeeling' had 'a delightful character'. With the
Assams he was looking for more 'briskness' or tannin. These were distinctly
suitable for milk. Another looked fine enough, but did not have the aromas
required of a proper, second flush, Assam. 'This is the better tea', he
said, pointing to the Newby Assam. This had the 'Ovaltine, malty character'
of proper Assam tea.
I had had my course: very refreshing it was too.
Newby Darjeeling and Assam teas are available from Safeway supermarkets. A
1/4 lb caddy of Darjeeling costs Pounds 2.65; Assam Pounds 2.49.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Cookery: The Italian way with noodles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching flakes swirl past the kitchen window the other day, I remembered my
last real encounter with snow - in alpine Italy one June. Yes, June.
The silent, white slopes of Lo Stelvio in Alta Valtellina are packed so deep
with snow that skiers go there when the season in other resorts has ended.
Not being much of a skier myself I toured the pistes on the back of a snow
plough.
Next day, in a sheltered valley near Sondrio, I visited the farm of a couple
whose riding stables provide ideal transport for touring the lower slopes of
the region. There, Laura Bonat gave me my first lesson in pasta-making.
Last week, I tried my hand at making pizzoccheri again, with Anna Del Conte
as my mentor, and this week I embarked on solo efforts.
Pizzoccheri is a speciality of Valtellina: broad-ribboned noodles with a
distinctive character provided by buckwheat flour. This is the speckled,
toasty, nutty-tasting ingredient we associate more readily with blinis and
galettes. Some health food stores sell it, as do Italian specialist shops.
Pizzoccheri can be dressed simply with sizzling garlic and sage-scented
butter and sprinkled with cheese. Strictly speaking, the cheese should be a
mixture of Parmigiano-Reggiano and bitto, which is a Valtellinese cheese
that melts well and is marvellously rich and complex in flavour when made
properly.
Fontina is the best substitute in Britain although, at a pinch, you can use
St Paulin or Port Salut if you are prepared to accept a lack of north
Italian authenticity.
Traditionally, pizzoccheri is dressed not only with flavoured butter and
cheese but also with cabbage and potatoes. In fact, so popular is this
combination in its homeland that the word pizzoccheri is used not just for
the pasta itself but also for the dish that includes the buckwheat noodles,
potatoes and cabbage.
PIZZOCCHERI (serves 6) While pasta is high-profile food in Britain and a
fashionable choice for informal entertaining, pizzoccheri is relatively
unknown. To make and serve your own could be one way to steal a march on all
but a few foodie cognoscenti.
For the pasta: 8oz buckwheat flour; 4oz plain white household flour,
preferably Italian 00; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 large egg; about  1/4 pt warm
semi-skimmed milk and water mixed.
For the dressing: 6oz potato, peeled and cut into  1/2 oz chunks; 12oz Savoy
cabbage sliced into  1/2 in-wide ribbons; 2 1/2 oz butter; 1 small onion
chopped very finely; 1 large garlic clove chopped very finely; 6-7
finely-shredded sage leaves; 2 1/2 oz freshly-grated Parmesan cheese; 5oz
fontina cheese (or St Paulin or Port Salut) cut into flakes.
Method: Sift both flours and salt into a ring on a work surface. Crack the
egg into the well and break it up with a fork.
Gradually, draw the flour into the egg and work in the tepid milky water by
slow degrees. (Depending on the quality of the flours and on humidity, you
might not need all the liquid or you could need a drop more).
Mix with a fork at first, then with your fingers, and knead gently for about
five minutes to make an elastic dough.
Wrap the dough and let it rest at room temperature for at least an hour (or
refrigerate it if preparing a day ahead).
Slice the dough like a loaf and flour each slice lightly. Either roll out
each one by hand until about  1/8 in thick, or pass them through the rollers
of a hand-cranked machine, tightening the rollers gradually up to the last
but two notches.
Cut the pasta into ribbons about 4in long by nearly  3/4 in wide. Lay them,
close but not touching, on clean cloths and leave to dry slightly before
cooking.
The knack of cooking pizzoccheri lies in using a really large pan (to
prevent over-crowding and sticking) and in getting the ingredients to
complete cooking simultaneously. The following are guidelines rather than
gospel; exact timing will depend, of course, on the thickness and elasticity
of the pasta, on the variety of potato, the size of the chunks, and so on.
Drop the potatoes into plenty of well-salted boiling water and cook for 10
minutes. Throw in the cabbage. As soon as the water comes back to the boil,
start adding the noodles, bit by bit and mixing them in well. Within five
minutes of the liquid returning to the boil, all three ingredients probably
will be ready.
While all this is happening, soften the onion thoroughly in the butter in a
separate small pan, together with the garlic and sage.
Drain the cooked pasta, potatoes and cabbage and return them to the pan.
Pour on the flavoured butter and toss to mix. Pile the mixture into a
well-heated, shallow dish, scattering the grated Parmesan and flakes of
cheese between layers.
Cover the dish with a dome of foil and slip it into a moderate oven for,
say, five minutes until the cheeses soften and melt. Serve quickly on hot
plates.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A red hot deal - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON and NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You should just catch two silly February deals from two of the UK's most
traditional merchants. Peatlings, of East Anglia (0284-755948), is offering
20 per cent off all table wines costing more than Pounds 10 a bottle. Its
claret and burgundy selections alone make this an offer worth investigating.
Laytons, of London NW1, (071-388-5081) has 20 trouvailles from classic
French regions of which the surprise snip is the red bordeaux Ch des Gondats
1984 at Pounds 4.70. No wine enthusiast worth his salt would even consider
buying a wine so suspiciously cheap from the 1984 vintage but this,
effectively the second wine of third-growth Margaux Ch Marquis de Terme, has
none of the skeletal nature of most 1984s and is even charming.
* * *
Both Sainsbury's and Oddbins are interested increasingly in buying small
parcels of wine and selling them through a limited number of stores - good
news for the consumer, although it makes life difficult for the wine writer
trying to give stockist details. Some 95 (of 350) branches of Sainsbury's
stock Hamilton Russell 1992 Chardonnay, which is worth seeking out. It is
made from some of South Africa's most southerly fruit and, at Pounds 6.95,
can offer a surprising amount of subtlety and a suitably savoury burgundian
character.
Good Sauvignon has long been easier to find in South Africa than exciting
Chardonnay but Les Enfants Sauvignon 1993 (from Vergelegen) is well worth
Pounds 3.95 at 100 Sainsbury stores.
* * *
One of the best meals during my last trip to Manhattan was at JoJo's, home
to Alsace-born chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He has since opened a second
restaurant, Vong, where French technique meets Thai influences such as lemon
grass and coconut milk.
From Monday, March 7, Vongerichten will be in London for a week cooking
alongside Jean-Christophe Novelli, chef at the Four Seasons restaurant in
west London (071-499-0888). Menus from Pounds 25.
* * *
The fifth floor at Harvey Nichols' store in west London houses not only a
restaurant, bar, cafe and food hall, but also an exceptionally catholic wine
shop where 750 different lines are on sale - at Knightsbridge (but not Silly
Knightsbridge) prices. On Mondays in March, diners in the restaurant can
drink at wine shop prices, uninflated by the usual restaurant mark-up.
* * *
Four years ago John and Sally McKenna formed their own publishing house,
Estragon Press. They have just published the third edition of The
Bridgestone Irish Food Guide (Pounds 11.99), which now stretches to more
than 300 pages of essential information for any traveller to Ireland.
* * *
Another publishing success has been the Logis of Great Britain hotel guide
(Pounds 6.50, 290pp), launched by Jenny and David Horsley in 1991 from their
home in Putney, south-west London. It adapts the successful formula and
strict conditions of entry from Logis de France. The 1994 guide has
information on 515 independently-owned hotels in the UK and Ireland, ranging
from traditional coaching inns to small country house hotels. The new,
user-friendly, central reservations system is on 0865-875888.

Officially, Chateau Cheval-Blanc has only been a first-growth claret since
St Emilion was classified in 1955, but its international reputation was made
by the remarkable, exceptionally rich 1921, the 1934 (probably the finest
claret of the 1930s) and the 1947 which established its British reclame. Yet
its renown went back a good deal further; the bronze medal won at the
International Exhibition in London in 1867 is still reproduced on the label.
For nearly 150 years it has been owned by the Fourcaud-Laussac family, today
represented by the charming Madame de la Barre and her two sisters, while
the wine is made by Jean Lurton, of the Bordeaux wine family.
Whereas St Emilion is overwhelmingly Merlot grape country, the 36-hectare
Cheval-Blanc vineyard is 60 per cent Cabernet Franc. In part it shares the
specially gravelly soil of neighbouring Figeac, while adjoining La
Conseillante makes it a near-Pomerol.
Of the eight first-growths it can reasonably claim to be the most
consistent, though not the most expensive in the auction room.
During last year's vintage, I had a vertical tasting at the chateau of every
year from 1993 back to 1981 - with the exception of the recently bottled
1991. A few weeks later, older years were added to some of the same vintages
at a tasting at the restaurant Bibendum (113 Regent's Park Road, London NW1.
Tel: 071-722-5577). Where it still has some stock of a vintage, the price
per case is given. At the chateau, some of the wines tasted were in half
bottles; 1993 and 1992 were cask samples.
1993. As elsewhere, hopes of a very fine vintage were dashed by recurrent
rain. The vintage began on September 20 and finished on September 30. Early
loads of Chardonnay and Merlot were excellent, the quantity was good, the
selection severe and it is expected to be superior to the 1992.
1992. Recently racked and fined, leading to a loss of colour and a whiff of
sulphur. A bad time to taste. Started fairly fruity on the palate, but ended
a bit hard and short.
1990. Deep colour, rich, porty nose, long flavour with great concentration.
Should turn out a great wine (Pounds 550 in bond).
1989. Good, not deep colour, with slight brown edge; closed bouquet, lighter
than 1990. Supple elegant flavour - hard to taste after the 1990 and may
develop well (Pounds 525 in bond).
1988. More colour than 1989, showed more nose at Bibendum, plenty of depth
of flavour, but markedly tannic. A wine to keep which should turn out a
classic.
1987. Brownish colour, old claret nose and sweet flavour, very attractive
for current drinking.
1986. Good, but not yet remarkably deep in colour; very rich, concentrated
nose, which developed in glass. Deep flavours, some tannin. One of the best
of the decade.
1985. More colour now than the 1986, but less aroma; charming fairly light
wine that may well last longer than expected (Pounds 495 in bond).
1984. Very brown nose, rather like 1987 but less fruit; typical of the worst
year of the decade.
1983. Brown tint, elegant bouquet, sweet, agreeable flavour but not a lot
behind it. Easy drinking now, but unlikely to last a great time.
1982. Fine colour, rich, concentrated nose, complex flavour with fine
balance; sweet and long in the mouth. What one looks for in a fine
Cheval-Blanc (Pounds 1,050 in bond).
1981. Showing a little brown, with a little more colour than 1982,
well-developed bouquet, distinguished flavour, more forward than 1982 and
good current drinking (Pounds 495 in bond).
1979. Medium, very clear colour, elegant nose, more flavour and longer than
many 1979s, but ends a little dry.
1975. Quite brown, but less acid on nose and flavour than many 1975s and
agreeable drinking though a bit short. One of the finer wines of the year
(Pounds 595 duty paid).
1971. Very pale in colour, nice soft nose; easy drinking, typical of the
year.
1970. More colour, bigger nose and flavour than 1971. A fruitier, less lean
wine than many 1970s. Still some tannin, should keep. (Pounds 975 duty
paid).
My choice for the future would be 1986, if it can be found.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Profile (12): If the
economy is really on the mend, small may once again be beautiful - Many
smaller-companies funds offer Peps, allowing investors high exposure to
domestic cyclical stocks. Bethan Hutton appraises a sector that is due for
recovery
</HEADLINE>

Smaller-company funds have been in the doldrums for several years, because
smaller companies were hit badly by the recession.
But last year the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index rose by about 40 per
cent, doing better than the FT-SE-A All-Share, which had a very good year
itself. However, that performance has not necessarily translated into
equally good returns for investors in collective funds.
'1993 was one of the better years on record for smaller companies, but not
for most small-company unit trusts, which underperformed both the Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index and the FT-SE-A All-Share Index,' says
Michael Lenhoff, a strategist with Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, in a
study of smaller company funds published this month.
Previous research suggested that smaller companies offered higher returns
for lower risk, the opposite of what is normally expected of investments.
But the Capel study says this anomaly was never easy to exploit, and has now
been eliminated; so, while smaller companies still offer higher potential
returns, this is at the expense of higher risk. The best performance is
concentrated in a small percentage of the very smallest companies, making it
difficult for fund managers to get exposure to enough of the right
companies.
However, the study concludes that stock-picking skills may become less
relevant to smaller companies, as market risk rather than specific risk
becomes the main source of variability of returns. The good news for small
investors is that this may make it easier for fund managers to outperform.
Investment trusts have a better record on smaller companies than unit
trusts. The average UK smaller companies unit trust grew by 33.69 per cent
over the year to February 1 (source: Micropal), while the average investment
trust in the same sector grew by 59.15 per cent. The same pattern of
investment trust outperformance is repeated over three, five and 10 years.
Lenhoff suggests that investment trusts may tend to perform better than unit
trusts in the smaller-company sector, because investment trust managers have
greater freedom to invest in smaller, illiquid or unquoted companies, and it
is precisely the smallest companies which have the greatest potential for
outperformance (though their risk is correspondingly high).
Unit trust managers are restricted both by regulations, and by the constant
awareness that the fund's holdings have to be liquid enough to sell in a
hurry if investors decide to cash in their units. This may mean that they
have to concentrate on the larger end of the smaller companies scale.
Investment trusts, meanwhile, can go as small as they like: the Pilot
investment trust, launched last year, picks companies from the very smallest
end of the market - those valued at less than Pounds 30m. The fund has grown
by almost 40 per cent over the past six months, and is currently trading at
a slight premium.
The discounts on most investment trusts in this sector are fairly narrow, at
around 5 per cent, and though there are one or two trusts at a premium, none
of them is high enough to make a unit trust's initial charge look like an
attractive alternative. However, as always with investment trusts, investors
run the risk that a wider discount will open up, and eat into the trust's
performance.
If smaller companies already put on such a spurt of growth last year, have
investors missed the boat? Lenhoff thinks not. 'We would look on last year
as the first instalment on a sustained period of outperformance for small
companies. The higher exposure of small companies to the more cyclical areas
of economic activity in the UK, combined with the fact that a greater
proportion of their earnings arise in the domestic economy, justify this
thinking.'
There are 56 UK smaller companies unit trusts to choose from, and 35
investment trusts. A large number of the unit trust groups include a smaller
companies fund in their own Pep schemes; as do some of the investment
trusts, including Pilot, TR Smaller Companies, Ivory &amp; Sime, Kleinwort
Benson, River &amp; Mercantile and Scottish Amicable. If the fund you like does
not have its own Pep scheme, you could also take the self-select route,
though this is less cost-effective for unit trusts.
As many European countries are at an earlier stage in the economic cycle
than the UK, investors looking further ahead should remember that European
shares are also eligible for full Pep investment. Morgan Grenfell's Europa
fund, Framlington's Continental Smaller Companies and Save &amp; Prosper's
European Smaller Companies are among the qualifying unit trusts with their
own Pep schemes. Fleming's European Fledgling is one investment trust in
this area with its own Pep. US, Asian or international smaller company funds
are subject to the Pounds 1,500 non-qualifying Pep limit.
Pure venture capital funds are currently excluded from Pep investment,
because they do not have at least half their investments in the form of
ordinary shares. However, in the last Budget, the chancellor proposed a new
type of venture capital fund, income and capital gains from which would be
tax-free, putting them on a par with Peps. Proposals are still being
studied, and the first funds are unlikely to appear before 1995.
Smaller-company shares tend not to be high yielding, so this is not a sector
for investors concentrating on income. As it is a relatively high-risk area,
it might also be unwise for first-time Pep investors to put all their money
into a smaller company fund. However, the sector can be seen as a useful
element in a balanced portfolio and, at this stage of the recovery,
investors who are not averse to a little spice might like to increase their
holdings.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Fashion: But is your uniform correct? - In our series of
dress codes around the world, FT writers look at what to wear on the golf
course

LONDON
Golf is, of course, a Scottish game. Its earliest players trudged the misty
greens in serviceable, dun-coloured tweeds, traditional woollies, rugged
plus-fours tucked into thick long socks, stolid brogues and a
rain-deflecting flat country cap.
Women - for the game was initially neither gender nor class-limited - tended
to vary the uniform only in the matter of a long skirt, later a divided one.
Once you remember those practical origins, today's lurid golfing uniforms
are easy to understand; their essential foul-weather nature has merely been
corrupted by effete southern taste, advances in fabric technology, American
vulgarity and Florida's climate.
Arguably, golf is the one sport for which special clothing is unnecessary.
Providing footwear is sturdy, gripping and comfortable and the rest is
unrestricting, what need for pastel argyll-patterned sweaters, loudly
checked slacks, luridly-two-toned zipper-fronted cardigans, green-visored
caps and spitefully spiked shoes?
The need, of course, is acceptance. Golf's uniform is about belonging to the
class of chap or lady - they certainly still call them ladies in proper
golfing circles - who belongs to a golf club. Britain is well-supplied with
municipal golf courses and persons do play there in their shellsuits and
plimmies, but that is not at all what golf is about in modern Britain.
For most of the participants golf is a whole, narrowly policed social scene,
a bastion of middle-class safety to which outsiders may aspire but which is
closely guarded against them. Within its bunkers business deals are done,
nephews are fixed up with first jobs, loans are made at advantageous rates
of interest. It is all easily done because it all happens between what
golfers fondly believe are their own kind.
So the uniform, achingly unstylish, is a signal system denoting a set of
values to which its wearers all subscribe. That these values are hardly
altruistic or even idealistic was demonstrated by America's Ryder Cup team
when its petulant members refused to shake the hand of the president who had
just increased the taxes on their enormous incomes.
As Mary Quant once observed, all specialised sports gear eventually catches
fashion's eye and becomes sexy. As she did not add, but might have: except
golfing gear - too middle class, too complacent, too ugly.
PARIS
There are some areas of life where the French are incorrigibly conservative
and golf is one of them. The ritual begins with the choice of club. Any old
golf club simply will not do.
The place where a Parisian plays golf speaks volumes about his, or her,
status. So the swankier the club, the better. Saint-Cloud, which boasts
President Mitterrand and half the cabinet among its members, is the
swankiest of all followed by La Boulie and Chantilly.
Yet the uniform is the same wherever you play. Parisians, predictably, dress
just as smartly for a few hours on the golf course as they do for any other
event. A polo shirt and shorts (neatly cropped just above the knee and
tapering to the waist) are de rigueur for summer as are well-cut trousers
and a V-neck jumper over the polo shirt for winter.
Colours are subdued. White is popular for golfing in warm weather, with
occasional glimpses of blue and green for light relief. Shoes are snowy
white: the very shade to show off a Cote d'Azur tan to perfection.
Hats are acceptable as long as they leave enough room for Ray-Bans and
co-ordinate with the other clothes. French golfers tend to regard clashing
colours, jaunty ballcaps and two-tone shoes as strictly for the Americans.
Anyone who thinks they might be able to worm their way into one of the more
sought-after French golf clubs without the requisite kit is doomed to
disappointment. Bernard Tapie, the former socialist cabinet's token
'medallion man', sauntered into Saint-Cloud last summer to deliver a speech.
The doorman told him to leave. Saint-Cloud, he said, was for members only
and Tapie was not one.
TOKYO
For the Japanese men and women who are wealthy enough to frequent the
country's golf courses, fashion on the green is a serious matter.
And just as strict conformity to the dress code in the office or on formal
occasions is taken for granted, those on the golf course are expected to
play by the rule of casual but conservative good taste.
So, men on the course will commonly be seen in trousers, polo shirt and vest
while women tend to opt for skirts that come to just above the knee or
culottes which are easy to move in. Their distinguishing feature is their
conformity to the 'golf look,' you can spot them a mile away.
As on other occasions, Japanese players in rain or mist favour
designer-clothes from Christian Dior to Yves Saint Laurent. In addition to
the famous French names, in golf, the good, old traditional names from
Britain, such as Burberrys and Dunhill, also go a long way.
For those who prefer a more casual look, and accessible price, than either
Dior or Dunhill affords, there are countless names from the world of golf to
adorn the pocket or cap.
Among the more popular are the Jack Nicklaus signature with his polar bear
symbol and Arnold Palmer with an umbrella. Such signatures can be found not
only on clothes but on everything else from hand towels to socks and
accessories.
Even though it is more often than not associated with business in Japan,
golf being a social occasion and increasingly popular among well-off
housewives, more colour than is seen on Tokyo's streets can be enjoyed in
the choice of clothes worn on the green.
Men who are normally restricted to drab grey and navy suits, do not hesitate
to appear in bright green, sky blue or lemon when it comes to a day swinging
the iron club.
But the real fun of dressing up for golf, the women say, comes after the
game is over.
Even in Japan, more people are taking advantage of their leisure time to
indulge their taste for sport, both as a physical experience and a chance to
mingle with others. That in turn has led to a growing taste for casual chic.
So, after a long, hot bath at the country club to revive both the body and
spirit, the women will join up with their men, looking refreshed in their
cashmeres and tweeds, wearing shoes from Italy, perhaps, and sporting a bag
made in Spain.
NEW YORK Patrick Harverson
Being asked to describe what Americans wear on the golf course immediately
brought to mind a sketch from the British television show Not the Nine
O'Clock News, the one which ridiculed golfers as men doing battle in an
elaborate ugly-trouser competition 'And it's Weiskopf now, putting for a
birdie, wearing an exceedingly silly pair of trousers. . .'
Yet, it would be unfair to lump New York's golfers in with the silly-trouser
brigade, for they are a different breed from their canary counterparts in
Florida and California. Perhaps in keeping with the north easterner's
patrician, faux-European, sensibilities, in recent years New York golf
fashions have tended to be more stylish, the colours subtler, the patterns
less stomach-churning. A new look is emerging as a younger generation of
golfers seek to avoid . . . well, looking too much like golfers.
Thus, the starchy, brightly coloured red-white-and-blue shirts and plaid
polyester slacks of old are out. In their place are baggier golf shirts in
moodier browns and olives or sensitive teals and taupes, and looser, more
stylishly cut trousers that would not look out of place in a chic
restaurant.
The city's golfers, it seems, are sick of wearing clothes that have to be
stashed away in embarrassment as soon as the last putt has been holed. In
their search for the complete, all-purpose casual wear, men are turning to
labels like Ralph Lauren's Polo, Bobby Jones, Cutter &amp; Buck, and Pelican
Hill, while women choose new designs from established names like Bogner,
Nordstrom and Evan Picone.
Essentially, golfers want to return to the elegant days of the 1930s and
1940s, when people regarded a round of golf as an excellent opportunity to
get in some exercise and show off the latest duds.
There are, however, a few golfers in New York, as there are everywhere, who
think that if they dress like the pros, they will play like the pros. This
means there will always be someone on the course wearing a hideously bright
shirt with a white-shark logo marketed by Australian star Greg Norman, or a
garish shirt and plus-fours like the ensemble that Payne Stewart wears to
every tournament. In spite of their reputation for savviness, New Yorkers do
not seem to realise that at least the pro golfers get paid to look stupid.
FRANKFURT Christopher Parkes
The pretty golf course at Kronberg, 20 minutes outside Frankfurt, is a quiet
place at the best of times. The sound of club on ball is rarely followed by
anything more than appreciative mutterings, and, naturally, the occasional
clunk of ball on an out-of-bound tree.
The players dress in keeping with their decorous behaviour. Long-distance
observations by a non-player suggest that in the peak season, summer,
women's costumes fall into two categories: pretty and sporty.
The first classification requires a white or pastel frock. Together with
matching ankle socks the ensemble is reminiscent of 1930s tennis rig. The
sportif look requires knee-length shorts with turn-ups, in a choice of pale
cottons or light plaids. A cotton eye-shade and a Ralph Lauren polo shirt -
or anything with one of the thousands of 'designer' logos which litter
German leisure wear - wrap things up.
There is one category for men's outfits: pretty sporty, but uniformly in the
Bernhard Langer style. To judge by appearances, it is a breach of club rules
to be under-equipped. Even the most casual thrash-about in the undergrowth
seems to require a full set of clubs (with hats), state-of-the-art trolley,
gloves, cap, sweater, pocket knife and trenching tools.
But there is rarely a sign of the crunchy waterproofs and the over-sized
umbrellas so common in Britain. Swinging in the rain is not a favoured
occupation among Frankfurt's fair-weather denizens of the fairways.
The Kronberg turf is clearly a place for being seen, not for getting wet. If
it is raining, or even cold, it's time to retreat to one of the area's
dozens of covered tennis courts.

Planning (11): A friend for life, and those days when you need a little
extra - The tax-break offers a means to repay a mortgage or meet school
fees, yet it is little used in such areas. Eric Short considers the
possibilities

Peps should form the core holding in the portfolios of investors who are
interested in the UK equity market.
Yet, while much is written about their tax-efficiency and flexibility, and
though the Pep market is constantly monitored for performance and charges,
less attention is given to the role that Peps should play in an individual's
financial planning strategy.
When someone has decided to invest in equities, whether directly into shares
or indirectly through collective funds, the bedrock of that investment
should be Peps. However, there are certain specific investment requirements
where a Pep should also be considered.
Many people who are in an employer's pension scheme want to boost their
retirement income beyond that provided by the scheme. In these days of
labour mobility, few will qualify for anything approaching the maximum
pension.
The traditional means of boosting a company pension is through additional
voluntary contributions (AVCs). But, although AVCs are highly tax-efficient
in accumulating cash, with tax relief on the contributions and investment in
gross funds, the benefits must be taken at the time of retirement as taxable
income. If the AVCs have been invested in equities and there is a bear
market at the time of retirement, the individual could suffer through being
forced to cash in the contract and buy a pension annuity.
In contrast, although contributions to a Pep are paid out of taxed income,
investment is tax-free (as with AVCs), and the benefits are both flexible
and tax-efficient. The benefits can be taken at any time. The investor may
take the dividend or distribution tax-free to boost income, leaving the
underlying capital intact.
Alternatively, he can use some or all of the accumulated capital to buy an
ordinary annuity - only part of that annuity's payments being taxable, in
contrast to a pension annuity where all the payment is taxable. If the
equity market is low, the investor can wait until it recovers before cashing
in.
It is not easy to make direct comparisons of the benefits provided by AVCs
and Peps. Ultimately it is a matter of personal preference. But the nearer
the investor is to retirement when he decides to invest in order to boost
his future income, the more advantageous is a Pep.
He is free to make his own arrangements for saving through a Pep, in
contrast to AVCs where the pension administrator would handle the
arrangements for investment in the in-house AVC - though not in the case of
a free-standing AVC from a life company. But, of course, the investor can
save through both AVCs and Peps, if he can afford it.
Most people in company pension schemes take the tax-free cash sum that is
available to them at retirement, in return for a lower pension - an exercise
known as 'commutation'. But most of these have only a hazy idea of what to
do with the cash when they receive it.
After paying for a Caribbean cruise, some of the remaining cash could be
invested in a Pep, which can be used to boost income, or to build up a cash
sum for use in later years or to be passed on to the next generation.
Another important specific requirement of many individuals is repayment of a
mortgage. When Peps were first launched, Pep mortgages were the vogue.
Financial advisers and journalists were strong advocates of their use as a
way to build up the sum necessary to repay a loan. The tax-free accumulation
of funds and the tax-free cash-in at the end looked highly attractive, until
the 1990 bear market reminded investors that equity prices could go down as
well as up.
Now, little is heard of Pep mortgages, which is a pity, because, properly
used, they are more tax-efficient than endowment or repayment mortgages.
Equities have, over the long-term, outperformed fixed-interest investments;
and mortgages are long-term commitments.
True, if the investor holds the Pep until the mortgage is due for repayment,
he runs the risk of having to cash in during a bear market; but if he adopts
the strategy of gradually switching out of the Pep and into deposits ahead
of the repayment date, he will avoid that risk, though at the expense of tax
efficiency.
A third specific investment requirement, for couples who want their children
educated in the private sector, is to save in advance saving towards payment
of school fees, which rise at least as fast as, if not faster than,
inflation. Savings towards these fees might be invested in assets, such as
equities, where the returns match inflation over the long term.
Peps should form part of such savings, though care is needed. The time until
fees will be due is comparatively short - 10 years if the individual is
planning well in advance, but often much less. However, since the fees are
payable over a five-year period, there is room for flexibility in cashing in
the Peps. Nevertheless, there should also be other savings, to cover parents
against the consequences of being forced to cash in Peps in a bear market.

FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Classics for the home - Looking for a desk
that is beautiful enough for domestic use and practical enough for work?
Lucia van der Post has the answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one who has visited Frank Lloyd Wright's famous building for S C Johnson
&amp; Co in Racine, Wisconsin, forgets it.
I still remember how it looked 12 years ago - a cool, tranquil, elegant
building, filled with light and air, so unlike any other office building I
had been in. It stood there, modern, yet classic, its slender, mushroom
columns rising from the floors, a seemingly idyllic combination of the
functional and the beautiful.
But what impressed me most was that everybody, from the managing director to
the humblest clerk and office worker, had a Frank Lloyd Wright desk of their
own.
They were not all identical but they all were recognisably from the same
family. They were all variations on a theme and had been made specially for
the building and its workers. For Frank Lloyd Wright, like his contemporary
Charles Rennie Mackintosh, believed that a totally harmonious environment
needed to be planned as a whole - furniture and artefacts had to be part of
the grand scheme.
Originally designed in the 1930s they are still in use and still look
elegant. Anyone who is looking for a desk that is beautiful enough to fit
into a domestic setting and practical enough need look no further than
Cassina's reproductions.
After a long courtship Cassina, the Italian furniture manufacturer, finally
got permission from S C Johnson to have access to the original prototypes,
drawings and stencils and it now offers a desk and chair that is a careful
reconstruction of the original design. A classic design of this quality does
not come cheap (Pounds 3,290) but it is of almost heirloom quality.
There is a very limited choice of colours - a brick red frame topped by
cherry wood (this is the closest colouring to the original) or a black,
stained ash top on a black metal frame.
The chair to partner the desk is made from painted steel with timber
armrests and the finishes match the desk - black steel with black stained
ash arm rests or brick red frame with cherry wood arm rests. The back and
seat pad can be covered in fabric or leather, prices range from Pounds 640
for fabric versions, from Pounds 693 for leather ones. The chair and the
desk can be bought from Atrium, Centrepoint, 22-24 St Giles High Street,
London WC2H 8LN.
Anyone wanting to know more about the furniture might like to visit the
Frank Lloyd Wright room at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London where
the chair and desk and other furniture and drawings can be seen.
If Frank Lloyd Wright prices are beyond your means, but you are still in
need of decent furniture from which to work at home, it is worth looking at
Philip St Pier's carefully-made collection. He primarily makes to order or
special commission but he has a small range of 'editions' which could be
said to be standard pieces.
Philip St Pier was originally a designer and maker but these days, in order
to produce more and bring costs down, he sub-contracts the making to
selected workshops. This means that he can sell a hand-made desk such as the
Consort (sketched here) for Pounds 700. The chair he sells for Pounds 375,
the coat-stand for Pounds 425. They can be ordered in a wide range of woods
and can be modified to suit specific requirements.
He has kept a workshop where he designs, makes up prototypes and mock-ups.
Besides the desk and office collection he has some sturdy garden furniture
and fine boxes.

FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Such a handy winter warmer - The gloves are
off as Lucia van der Post beats the cold snap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Just back from Kenya and Tanzania (yes, thank you, I had a smashing time and
I hate to tell you but it was hot, hot, hot) to find England reeling from
the cold.
Time to try out a pair of Tollybands. Some of you may remember that, long
ago when the world was young, people in rural areas used to wear sheepskin
wristbands to keep their hands warm.
Primarily designed for those who needed to keep their hands free in cold
weather - tennis players, outdoor stall-holders, gardeners - those who felt
really cold could wear them as well as gloves.
Tollybands are a revival of the old idea and I have to report that they
work. The reason why is that they keep the blood flowing into the hands
warm. Even in this week's freezing weather they kept my hands warm without
gloves.
Tollybands come in a range of colours - the chicest being bottle green which
would blend wonderfully with all those ubiquitous waxed cotton jackets.
Those addicted to other colours will find something to match.
They cost Pounds 14.99 a pair (including p &amp; p) from Tollybands, Old Wool
House, PO Box 70, London SW3 5XU.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Decorative tiles have been somewhat out of favour in the last few years  -
not grand enough for the Baroque school of decorating and much too sweetly
pretty for the minimalists. They must be due for a revival. Marlborough
Tiles is a small company making high-quality ceramic tiles which are widely
stocked throughout the UK. Those whose tastes run to the rustic and charming
can choose the pretty florals whilst those who prefer a little wit can go
for the trompe l'oeil (plates, teapots, tureens, jugs). The panels are sold
in sets - the trompe l'oeil plate, for instance, takes four tiles and would
cost Pounds 17.63. The hyacinth panel needs nine tiles and costs Pounds
52.88. They can be used as panels in work-tops or splashbacks.
Marlborough Tiles is at Elcot Lane, Marlborough, Wiltshire SN8 2AY. Ring

FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: The lunch-box revival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nathalie Hambro felt it was time to revive the old-fashioned lunch-box, the
western answer, if you like, to the Indian tiffin box. Instead of wasteful
cling-film and polystyrene unattractively cluttering up the desk, she thinks
it would be more elegant to use a sleek container which could be used time
and time again with pleasure. She therefore designed this understated box,
made from silver-glow finished steel. It would be perfect for conveying a
bruschetta or grilled zucchini to your office-desk. Not that it is only a
lunch-box. She, for instance, uses it to convey all her daily needs (you and
I might call it a hand-bag but Nathalie is not fond of the term). It is
stocked by discerning shops such as David Mellor, No 4 Sloane Square, London
SW1, Jerry's Home Store, 163-167 Fulham Road, London SW3 and Liberty of
Regent Street, London W1. The price is about Pounds 11.50.

FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Taking the plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not since Madonna strapped a black, pointy Gaultier carapace to her bust
have bras been so inescapably visible. This time, the commotion is the
Wonderbra, undisputed queen of the push-up-and-plunge market for 30 years
until January when a rival, Ultrabra, declared itself the 'ultimate in
cleavage.'
The background is this. The Wonderbra was first made in 1964 by Canadelle, a
sister-company of Playtex. Courtauld's Gossard held the licence from 1964
until this year when Playtex snatched it back.
With magazines such as Vogue promising a return to curves and a farewell to
the superwaif, Playtex could hardly allow arch-rival Gossard to hang on to
the lucrative production of the Wonderbra, which has 12 per cent of the UK
branded bra market.
Now Playtex has the Wonderbra name, it is spending Pounds 1m promoting its
range of bras, bodies and panties. There have been glitzy launches, a
surfeit of newspaper puns - Storm in a D-Cup, Bra Wars, the Breast is
History - and a cheeky poster campaign.
Gossard is spending a reported Pounds 2.7m on the Ultrabra, which to the
inexpert eye resembles the Wonderbra it used to make: underwired, padded,
lacy and with surgical-looking straps: not so much lingerie as engineering.
Should those seeking cleavage pick Gossard, with its 30 years' experience
making the Wonderbra, or Playtex? Or are the two bras as similar on
performance and design as they are on price (Pounds 14.99 for the padded
plunge lace)?
On closer examination, the bras do look different. Gossard, freed from the
production requirements that were tied to the licence, has made changes. Its
straps are more angled away from the cups, for uplift, and it looks slightly
more delicate with a pearly bow between lower-scooped cups.
Gossard will not give details of the 'refinements' it says make the Ultrabra
easier to produce. Mark Pilkington, the marketing director, calls the 46
components and 28 sewing stages the 'miracle system'.
'Essentially, it is underwired for uplift, and the way it holds the back
down helps to push the front up,' he explains.
The Wonderbra has hardly changed. Playtex is not attempting to stray from
the principles that made the bra a success 30 years ago - the licence
forbids such change. The backs are made of strong nylon powernet, set at a
'very sharp angle' to the cups, to make sure that 'the cup wires sit around
the breast at a slight angle pushing it towards the centre front of the body
for maximum cleavage.'
The consumer can only benefit from bra wars. Gossard and Playtex have
introduced different fabrics - broderie anglaise, satin; and colours -
raspberry, navy and flame.
You will probably need a size larger than you think. Gossard and Playtex's
idea of sizing has little to do with reality and everything to do with
flattery.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Profile (19): A new line
in charges that made rivals head for the exit - John Authers spotlights
Fidelity, and a novel marketing concept, launched at a difficult time but
since copied by other investment groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidelity, the American unit trust giant, appears to have established that
companies in the Pep market can compete on price.
In 1992, it became the first unit trust group to introduce tapered exit
charges on its Peps. The initial charge was cut to only 2 per cent, but exit
charges would also be payable when investors wanted to realise their Pep. If
they surrendered the Pep within a year, they would need to pay an extra 3
per cent. But savers who held on for more than three years would need to pay
nothing at all.
Journalists and advisers found it difficult to criticise this arrangement,
as Peps are medium- to long-term investments, and it would be difficult ever
to recommend taking out a Pep without holding on to it for at least three
years. Fidelity was offering prudent investors a genuine reduction in price,
and, it said, was also trying to demonstrate that Peps as a product were
good value for money.
Not surprisingly, it caught on. Exit charges have now been introduced by
such industry leaders as M&amp;G and Gartmore.
But Fidelity has benefited the most. As astute observers noted at the time,
its fortunes were not great in 1992.
The company had lost market share in Peps, from 4.4 per cent of the market
in the 1990-91 tax year to 2.2 per cent in 1991-92. Also, its excellent
investment performance - which allowed Fidelity to establish itself in the
UK and become one of the top five players within a decade  - had gone
distinctly off the boil. Its Special Situations trust, at one point a
leader, languished in 108th place out of 125 over the previous three years.
Mr John Spiers, an analyst with BESt Investment, chimed with much thought in
the industry when he said: 'Clearly, Fidelity felt it had to do something
dramatic.'
Since then, Fidelity's Pep sales, if not 'dramatic', have shown an
impressive strength. From Pounds 55m in the 1991-92 tax year, they rose to
Pounds 110m in 1992-93, and the company claims that month-by-month sales so
far this year have doubled again.
However, Fidelity disputes that the price change was critical. The company's
traditionally aggressive fund management style was about to pay dividends,
as 'Black Wednesday' - the pound's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism - was in the offing.
Over the two years to the beginning of 1994, Hardwick Stafford Wright
figures show that Fidelity Special Situations rose by 72.5 per cent - fourth
in its sector of 132, and just behind the similarly aggressive Fidelity
Recovery fund.
This suggested a return to the fund management success which has been the
group's bedrock in the US, where whole magazines are devoted to advice on
how to trade in different Fidelity funds.
Slick American marketing has also helped.
Fidelity has steadily introduced new products to fill different niches in
the market, and this month sees the launch of another new trust - the UK
Dividend Growth Fund - which will be aimed at those intending to retire
within 10 to 15 years. The trust is linked to the Retirement Income Builder
Pep, which carries the now standard Fidelity entrance and exit charges.
Fidelity is also launching a new Pep for its fund of funds, which invests
solely in other Fidelity unit trusts, to bring its total Pep range to 12.
These are: UK Growth, Special Situations, Recovery, Growth &amp; Income, Income
Plus, High Income, European, European Income, European Opportunities, and
the International Pep. A further Pep, based on a trust investing in global
privatisations, is in the pipeline.
On top of these, the company also offers a single-company Pep, for those who
want to invest an extra Pounds 3,000 each year. Savings schemes, from a
minimum of Pounds 50 a month, are also available.
Management charges are in line with industry averages, ranging from 1.0 to
1.5 per cent.
Mr Barry Bateman, managing director of Fidelity Investments, and chairman of
the Unit Trust Association (now the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds) from 1991 to 1993, said that sales had also been helped by
the low interest rates which followed Black Wednesday.
Fidelity has built a range of supporting products, such as the cash unit
trusts, which provide an innovative range of services. However, it will need
to stay competitive. M&amp;G, the doyen of the unit trust industry, now
undercuts it on price, albeit for only one fund, and others have equalled
it.
Bateman is aware, following 1992, that the company must continue to produce
impressive fund management figures if it is to maintain its strong position.
He said: 'There's a tendency for people to buy our most aggressive funds.
One thing we haven't done as successfully as I would have liked is to have
promoted our blue chip funds.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Motoring: Cars to spend your own money on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should motorists spending their own money buy new or used cars? Commonsense
dictates used, if only to beat the hefty initial depreciation that affects
all new cars. Indeed, about twice as many used cars are bought each year as
new ones.
Forget the financial arguments, though. There is something special about the
feel - even the smell - of a new car.
Three I have been driving would appeal to genuine private motorists who
cannot resist the temptation of buying new but must watch initial cost
carefully: the Seat Ibiza, Hyundai Lantra and Proton Persona.
The Ibiza is the latest small car to come from the Volkswagen Group's
Spanish subsidiary. Although its looks are individual, its mechanicals are
mainly VW.
I tried two Ibizas: first a 1.8 GLXi five-door (Pounds 10,495), and then a
1.9 CLX diesel five-door at Pounds 8,995. As this is Pounds 1,000 cheaper
than a VW Golf LD with an identical engine, it is quite a bargain.
There is also a three-door Ibiza diesel, no different under the skin and
priced even more keenly at Pounds 7,595. The diesels do not have the
1.8-litre petrol car's electric windows but power-assisted steering is
standard.
Although, on paper, the 90-horsepower 1.8 GLXi is much nippier, the 68hp
diesel has almost the same torque (pulling power at a given engine speed).
This gives it such good pick-up that their performance feels little
different.
The diesel held its own on the motorway just as easily and was a clear
winner at the pump, averaging 48 mpg (5.9 l/100 km) compared with the petrol
car's 36 mpg (7.85 l/100 km). An Ibiza diesel would be hard to beat as an
economical runabout with legs long enough for relaxed and economical holiday
journeys. Build quality is good and the seats comfortable.
Both the Malaysian Proton Persona 1.5 GLi and Korean Hyundai Lantra are
Japanese-type cars in all but price. Well, almost. Compared with
similarly-sized Hondas or Toyotas, there is a certain lack of finesse, and
the Proton's ride was a bit knobbly on roughish roads.
Low initial cost is a powerful argument, however, when a car is being bought
out of taxed income or perhaps with a lump sum on retirement. For a modest
Pounds 9,770, the buyer of a Proton Persona 1.5GLi five-door gets a vehicle
comparable in size with a Ford Mondeo or Vauxhall Cavalier, which cost
between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000 more.
The Proton lacked power steering. Nor did it have a sun roof, central
locking or electric windows. But the radio/tape player did not sound like a
cheapie and the five-speed gearbox had a delightfully light shift (as, for
that matter, did those of the Ibiza and the Lantra).
The 12-valve, 1.5-litre engine is like that of the old Mitsubshi Lancer and
is, thus, a little long in the tooth. But it ran sweetly, and the fairly low
overall gearing made acceleration brisk enough to satisfy all but those
obsessed with performance. Consumption is around 38 mph (7.4 l/100 km). For
those whose expectations (and resources) are greater, there are versions of
the Persona with new 1.6-litre, 16-valve engines and power-assisted steering
from Pounds 10,410.
The Hyundai Lantra. I drove was the top of the range 1.8-litre CD. It had
power-steering, with anti-lock brakes, a driver-side airbag, power sun roof
and air-conditioning. It costs Pounds 13,299 (Pounds 14,098 with automatic
transmission), which is about Pounds 2,000 less than you would pay for a
European or Japanese equivalent.
The Lantra, quite low-geared at 20mph (32 kph per 1,000 rpm) in fifth, was
notably quick off the mark. High engine revolutions when motorway cruising
do not help fuel consumption, though; the Lantra averages around 30 mpg (9.4
l/100km).
A safety feature familiar to American motorists, but barely known on cars in
Europe, is an interlock between the starter motor and clutch. Unless you
press the pedal right down when you turn the key, the starter will not work.
This is something that would be appreciated by absent-minded drivers who
leave parked cars in gear.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Sport: Surfing close to the edge in ski goggles - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With half the contest over, the 32,000-mile Whitbread race is turning into a
battle between two yachts and two very different skippers.
Intrum Justitia, the European entry helmed by British sailor Lawrie Smith,
leads the Japanese / New Zealand team aboard Tokio by around 20 miles.
Chris Dickson, Tokio's highly competitive skipper, predicted before leaving
Auckland last Sunday that Intrum was the boat they would be watchful of,
once the fleet hit the big winds of the Southern Ocean.
So it proved. Tokio led the celebratory waltz out of Dickson's home port.
But when the strong breezes came on the second day at sea Intrum blasted
through, covering 400-plus miles in a one-day run while still off the coast
of New Zealand. Before the advent of the water-ballasted W60 class, such
distances were achieved only by the biggest maxi-yachts in the most extreme
conditions.
What interests most observers, not least Chris Dickson, is what makes Intrum
such a flier? Both Intrum and Tokio (plus another five boats in the
10-strong W60 fleet) are designed by Bruce Farr. The differences between the
two are tiny, although Intrum does have the steering positions so far aft
that the helmsman is practically standing on the transom. In the extreme
running and reaching conditions below 50' south, when the bow wave starts at
the mast and dumps straight back into the cockpit, the man at the wheel
wants to be as far from the action as possible. Even so, it is essential to
wear ski goggles and a mouth and nose mask designed for motocross motor
cyclists to be able to breathe through the blizzard of icy spray.
Nevertheless, Dickson says it is not mechanics that give the advantage.
Dickson believes these are minor technical points. 'Sure they've got a fast
car but so have we. They've got some excellent helmsmen who are totally
fearless. Driving at night on an icy road, they've just got the pedal on the
floor. Every time it blows 50 knots they're taking miles out of us.'
Dickson has spent some of the four-week stop in his home town pondering how
hard he wants to pound his yacht and crew. 'It's dark. You're crawling
around the deck because the vibration makes it impossible to stand. The bow
wave starts at the mast and the solid part comes straight back into the
cockpit. You're off the top of one wave and into the middle of the next.
Something inside me says we shouldn't have the spinnaker up,' mused Dickson.
So he makes the prudent choice and the kite comes down. 'Unfortunately the
next morning someone like Intrum has kept theirs up and gained 20 miles,'
continued Dickson. 'Then I go against all my instincts and put ours back up.
You're beyond the edge of control and it's a difficult decision.'
New records for 24-hour runs have been set by Intrum, piling sail on as the
gales build. South of Tasmania in the third leg Intrum went from back marker
to leader in a day by sailing ahead of a fierce storm with spinnaker and
full mainsail set.
'We decided to push ourselves through the storm,' said Intrum's navigator
Marcel van Triest. 'It took tremendous crew work and guts but we sailed past
four boats to find ourselves in the lead.'
Halfway through the race, Dickson believes his 17-hour overall lead has been
built on a 'safety first' approach. But he doubts that such a policy will
keep the pursuing fleet at bay for much longer. 'In the heavy air down south
we've been erring towards safety and seamanship. We've got to think again
about that,' he said.
Smith, who can be as flamboyant and devilish as Dickson is calm, ascribes
Tokio's lead to a secret weapon. Smith left Auckland convinced that Tokio
had a few unorthodox sails in her inventory.
'At certain angles, close fetching, Dickson is faster than anyone in the W60
fleet. It's between 10 and 20 knots of breeze that the advantage comes in,'
said Smith. 'He's obviously able to put up a sail that we just don't have.
Whether it's legal or not I don't know.'
Forty-eight hours before the re-start Smith had sent Swedish watch leader
Gunnar Krantz to the airport with a one-way ticket to Stockholm. 'We weren't
getting on very well, so it's best that he left,' said Smith.
Krantz was one of the original Intrum Justitia crew recruited by Roger
Nilsson, whom Smith replaced at the Punta del Este stopover. Dutch helmsman
Marco Constant, 33, has taken Krantz's berth. He sailed aboard Atlantic
Privateer in the 1985 - 86 Whitbread.
Krantz may have bumped into Irish sailor Joe English at the departures
lounge. Dickson said English was leaving the Tokio project 'for personal
reasons'.
Around the waterfront bars the story was different. Crew mates said Dickson
and English disagreed over how far to push the boat downwind. His place has
gone to Californian helmsman Peter Heck. Dickson has raced with him on the
ultimate downwind speed machines, the 70ft Santa Cruz sleds. The underlying
message of this is clear. To get the best out of the W60s in heavy air
requires at least half the crew to be outstanding, even world class,
helmsmen. They must also be happy to work standing in front of a fire hose.

Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994. They have
reached the US mid-west. Arnie writes
If we were sailing instead of skiing, this would be the doldrums. We are not
becalmed but snow in the Chicago area is hard to come by in spite of the
cold spell. And vertical feet are never a strong point in the mid-west.
After the dizzy heights of Colorado, we have entered the twilight zone of US
skiing. We have to reach New York and we chose a route that avoided the
better-known resorts in eastern Canada and instead drove across the plains
of the mid-west.
Resorts here are so small that you imagine you have seen one from the road
and it turns out to be a white barn roof. Imagine the dry ski slopes in
Britain with man-made snow on them and you have some idea of the relative
size.
Villa Olivier, for all its exotic connotations, is nothing more than a
garbage heap cleverly converted into a small ski hill. Do not knock it. What
better use could there be for a load of Chicago refuse?
Plenty of Chicago children have learnt to ski there. Ditto Four Lakes
Village, with a vertical drop of 100ft and rope tows, the early uphill
transport.
Alpine Valley, 388ft, did not exactly tower above the local countryside but
it is high enough to have caused the death of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the blues
guitarist, when his light aircraft crashed in fog. Nobody had told the pilot
there was a man-made hill in the vicinity. Lucy and I had to climb the hill
in order to ski that day since the lifts were closed following heavy
overnight rain.
We decided to give another minnow, Wilmot Mountain, 240ft, a miss when we
heard that the owner was reluctant to give us a free ride up to the top of
his hill. As we head south to Kentucky and Alabama things can only improve.
Or can they?

FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: Heady brew of beer and capitalism - Michael
Thompson-Noel finds that even a teetotaller can have fun in the old
breweries of Bohemia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
Even a teetotaller can enjoy a knees-up in a brewery in Bohemia. I haven't
tasted alcohol since 1983, when I became a learner-driver, but I still like
to watch other people drinking. Especially to excess. Annihilating brain
cells with flairful indifference.
This party was under way in the hospitality room of the recently modernised
Regent brewery in Trebon, in the Czech Republic, about three hours south of
Prague, not far from the Austrian and German borders. The brewery was
founded in 1379, prospered in the middle ages, and was once owned by Prince
Schwarzenberg.
The beer flowed. An excellent three-man combo, part of the brewery's brass
band, played blood-rousing drinking songs. And the brewery's manager,
immensely proud of his beer, twirled around in raptures of delight, making
little speeches, beating time to the music, flirting with the PR, badgering
the servers to serve the beer faster and beaming his delight at welcoming to
his brewery a small group from England. The group was visiting the area at
the invitation of another Bohemian brewery in nearby Ceske Budejovice
(formerly Budweis).
In 20 years' time, Prague, the Czech capital, may have reclaimed its
position as one of Europe's most cultured cities. It is a marvellous place;
go there now. But if you want to see how capitalism and democracy are
bursting into colour in the dawning Czech spring, you could do worse than
south Bohemia, especially the area around Trebon and Ceske Budejovice.
There are plenty of cheap hotels, some of them more than comfortable. Plenty
of sights to see. And a foaming river of beer. The food is intriguingly dire
 -not for want of ingredients; the problem is the cooking - but cannot fail
to improve. Anyway, this close to the Austrian border there are numerous
fine coffee dives and plenty of cream cake.
The previous day we had toured the Samson brewery (est. 1795) in Ceske
Budejovice. Samson, still owned locally, is interesting for the foreign
friends it is making and for its success in pumping up the volume of exports
of Czech lager.
Its Zamek brand of premium-strength lager is imported into Britain by
Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, otherwise known as Banks's. Fran Hayes,
Zamek's UK brand manager, reckons that by 2000 premium lager will account
for a quarter of all UK beer sales, and says: 'Zamek has been positioned to
be recognised as a major participant in the beer market, coming as it does
from the land of the lager experts.'
Lager was invented by the Czechs, in Pilsen in 1842. As a result, the
marketing effort in Britain can claim that Zamek is a distillation of
'Czechness,' its strong, golden taste - I am taking this on trust - deriving
from a combination of 'fragrant Zamek hops, locally grown malted barley,
exceptionally soft Czech water and a special strain of yeast.'
Not that the Czechs need help consuming the stuff. They drink 36 gallons of
beer per head per year, the world's highest such consumption.
They have been brewing beer in Ceske Budejovice since 1254. It is an airy
and pleasant town - capital of south Bohemia, population just below 100,000,
thriving tourism, two universities, a re-established tramway system and a
scientific library, which replaced the former museum of the workers'
revolution. Some good hotels and restaurants, too, including the Hotel Zvon:
excellent and not expensive. Very little in the Czech Republic is expensive,
especially food and lodging or the crystal glassware you can buy almost
everywhere.
Not far away is Cesky Krumlov, a splendid medieval town which is now
Unesco-listed. Tourists flock there and can hardly be disappointed,
especially by the castle, which has a famous ballroom and a superb late
Baroque theatre. This is a great town for festivals: music, theatre, dance
and exhibitions. From June 17-19 it stages its annual festival of the
five-petalled rose, which includes music, parades, a folk market, night
shows and something called 'live chess.'
On a much smaller scale, I was greatly taken with Trebon and its surrounding
forests, moorland, lakes and fish-ponds. Fish farming, particularly carp
farming, started locally in the 13th century; the art of fish breeding is
said to have reached its peak three centuries later, under the rule of the
last lord of the Rosenberg family.
An information guide to Trebon makes slightly bleak reading. 'Have you
decided to spend your holidays in Trebon?' it asks. 'Maybe you are in town
for the first time and thus we would like to make easier your decision where
to go in leisure time. Of many possibilities we have chosen: Walk to
Opatovicky mill. Walk along Zlata stoka canal. Walk to the hillock. Walk to
the Rosenberg fish-pond. Walk around the Svet fish-pond.'
Trebon is far more appealing than that, with plenty of accommodation, from
hotels to private homes.
Numerous tour operators and agents organise holidays in the Czech Republic.
It has good roads and is easy to get about. Information: tourist office at

FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: A perfect Caribbean meal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surely the ideal setting for a Caribbean restaurant is a palm-thatched hut
on the waterfront, with a perfect view over the beach to a turquoise sea.
This would be an ideal place to pass the heat of the afternoon. But this is
to forget that so many places in the tropics are more atmospheric at night.
One of the finest settings of any restaurant in the Caribbean is that of
Anacoana on the island of Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands. By
day, the view takes in the surreal blue Caicos sea, with the deep ocean in
the distance marked clearly by a line of breaking waves and a darker blue,
but the restaurant really comes into its own after dark.
Anacoana stands just above the miles and miles of sand of Grace Bay, next to
the Grace Bay Club. You dine under palm thatch where tables are laid out in
three palapas, open-sided huts with pointed roofs like American-Indian straw
houses. But the roofs are supported on a circle of classical columns and so
the feel is part straw hut, part temple.
The evening breeze, chopped and chased by the ceiling fans, finds its own
path among the tables. In front of the palapas are ranged a number of
parasols where other tables stand beside the tropical greenery. Looking
towards the darkness, the palm trees are floodlit and the smoke from flaming
torches plays in the glare; beneath them, tall strands of guinea grass are
etched yellow against the black of the night.
The chef is a young Canadian, Stuart Gray, who trained in Canada and then in
Britain, working all the time with French chefs. His cuisine is eclectic, he
says. He borrows flavours and ideas wherever he travels, and these have
found their way into the menu at Anacoana - the fillet of salmon is
flavoured with ginger and lime butter and the lobster-tail with saffron. But
Gray can also turn his hand to a very fine filet of steak in a rich red wine
and mustard sauce.
Most important, all his food is fresh, which is often a problem in the
Caribbean. But the Turks and Caicos are close enough to Miami to get the
best meats on a regular basis. Gray makes the most of Caribbean ingredients,
including local lobsters, grouper and snapper, smoking some of them for
variety. His desserts are excellent, too, and meals are rounded off with
home-made truffles.
If food has traditionally been a problem in the Caribbean, there are more
and more passable restaurants opening. They are pretty expensive, but they
are an important holiday ingredient. Service can be a little haphazard, but
this ought not to be a severe problem when you are adjusting to island time,
anyway, and are in a wonderful setting.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: Antarctica, beyond the comfort zone - Michael J.
Woods watches seals, terns and whales in inhospitable waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With hardly a sound, the sea lapped on to the shore of granite, ground to a
silky smoothness by ice and water - itself blanketed by a layer of snow.
Portly crab-eater seals lay enveloped in the folds of this fluffed and
plumped duvet or sprawled on bluish ice floes carved and drawn like glass
into delicate graceful shapes by the sea. Distant cliffs of rock and ice
loomed through a mist of floating flakes of a soft shower of snow.
Antarctic terns cried and hovered over a shoal of fish, diving and then
swooping upwards on confident wings. But from a distance came the sudden
roar of a collapsing ice cliff which, with immense force, sent a surge of
waves sweeping into the bay, a timely reminder that Antarctica is far from
placid and, even in the austral summer, can be fierce and inhospitable.
I had come here to fulfil a childhood dream born out of Scott, Amundsen and
Shackleton, nurtured by Edmund Hillary and Vivien Fuchs and given a final
push by David Attenborough's BBC series, Life In The Freezer.
From Punta Arenas in southern Chile our cruise ship, World Explorer, had
navigated the Beagle Channel, rounded the Horn and then braved the Drake
Passage, a two-day gauntlet run by every visitor to the Antarctic Peninsula.
The gods had been kind, and we stole into the shelter of the South Shetland
Islands with half a day in hand.
This gave us time to slip into the Weddell Sea, gliding delicately between
tabular icebergs which had calved from the ice shelf and were drifting
slowly away from the continent. These flat-topped monoliths, like blocks of
flats badly cast in concrete, towered high above the seven decks of the
ship. That a further eight ninths plunged into the depths below was almost
beyond comprehension.
Although there were some on board who had no intention of going ashore, and
others who simply wanted to tick off their final continent, many of the
passengers told me that they really weren't 'cruise people.' They were there
because the only way that Antarctica is readily accessible to ordinary
visitors is by cruise ship.
These not only provide comfortable accommodation with minimal impact on the
environment, but visits to the shore by inflatable Zodiac can be more easily
controlled.
I happened to be on World Discoverer when it was undergoing its biennial
check by an observer from the National Science Foundation who had come along
to ensure that the cruise was being run in a safe way; that passengers were
receiving both education and supervision with regard to the wildlife they
were seeing; and that the operation was observing the guidelines set down by
its own controlling body, the International Association of Antarctic Tour
Operators (Iaato).
This may sound dreadfully regimented and restrictive, but some constraints
are clearly necessary as the numbers of visitors, to what amounts to only a
tiny proportion of the continent, grows.
Such controls are at their most extreme only when large numbers of
passengers are ashore. As a result, the expedition leader's advice to take
an early Zodiac ashore and catch the last one back was worth heeding.
On one of my trips ashore I watched a mass of chin-strap penguins in an
odoriferous rookery high on a stony hillside. There were birds feeding
chicks, stealing pebbles from their neighbours' nests, preening, displaying
or making their ponderous and squelchy way over dirty snow to and from the
sea.
On the shore below, a steaming heap of elephant seals wobbled irritably as
one animal tried to burrow further into the pile. Occasionally things proved
too much and a pair reared up, snorting and lunging, until honour was
satisfied and the two brown blancmanges settled down once more.
As we climbed aboard the last Zodiac to leave our final landfall at Port
Lockroy, one of the guides spotted the blow of a humpback whale a short
distance away, and we set off over the choppy water for a closer look.
The three great mammals were in no hurry and lazed along on the surface,
breathing noisily before arching their backs with utmost grace and sliding
into the depths, lifting their tails clear of the water - called fluking -
before disappearing with hardly a ripple. The Zodiac, which for a few
seconds had been dwarfed by cetacean tails, erupted with elated cries.
We followed the circular upwellings of water created by thrusts of their
flukes, and were there when they resurfaced after just 3 1/2 minutes. Again
they lazed on the surface; again they fluked. But time was passing and we
had to return to the World Discoverer.
Back on board, the mother ship began to shadow the whales. The sun was
falling in a clear, pale blue sky and our position between the Antarctic
Peninsula and several large islands felt as if we were sailing on a vast
lake surrounded by the soaring spires of mountains, unnamed and unexplored,
with dark, snow-dusted peaks piercing the huge iceflows.
These, the product of decades of snow, clawed down the mountain sides and
crumpled over folds in the underlying rock before calving chunks into the
dark blue Antarctic Ocean.
The great cetaceans had the muscle to outpace us had they wished, yet they
continued on their leisurely way, fluking and diving to delighted cheers
from the bows.
It would be hard to think of a natural spectacle more magnificent than
watching these massive mammals in a primeval landscape of such grandeur, so
outside the human dimension as to be at once both humbling and
awe-inspiring. Most of those on the ship - some were extremely
well-travelled - were unlikely to experience a scene of such power and
splendour anywhere else.
Michael Woods travelled to Antarctica c/o Clipper Voyages: Suite 301, Albany
house, 324-326 Regent Street, London W1R 5AA. Reservations: 071-436-2931.
The company runs adventure cruises during the austral summer (16 nights or
more).
All-inclusive prices, including airfares, transfers, hotels where necessary,
full board on the ship and insurance, start from Pounds 4,606 (1994-1995
season) for the 16-night cruise that Woods experienced (two departures: Dec
4 1994 and Jan 2 1995). Clipper will be operating a further six voyages to
the Antarctic, taking in, additionally, the Falklands and South Georgia.
World Discoverer handles a maximum of 138 passengers.
Clothing: Clipper provides a padded parka but other items are essential.
Thermal underwear as a base layer, and good quality fleece garments such as
those made by Mountain Equipment (tel: 061-366-5020) as an intermediate
layer, should be covered with a windproof outer shell. The parka is fine but
Woods found a Goretex outer over a down jacket more flexible. Waterproof
trousers and wellingtons are essential in the Zodiacs and for wet landings.
Photography: take plenty of film as well as spare batteries, which are
exhausted more quickly in the cold. A tripod is useful at the penguin
rookeries and for the seals. Carry polythene bags to protect your gear.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - High-Income PEPs (9):
Can complexity defeat risk? - Some of the plans that have been devised to
provide income as high as 10 per cent, at a time when base rates are much
lower, have been viewed with caution.  Scheherazade Daneshkhu examines them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The desire of many investors for a high income has prompted financial
services groups to launch products to satisfy that need. There are plenty of
'high income' Peps offering around 5 per cent income, but few that can go as
high as 10 per cent.
It does not come as a complete surprise, then, that one of the most
successful Peps to be launched should be Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher
Income Plan, which has managed to raise almost Pounds 500m since February
1993 on the promise of a 10 per cent income after charges, paid monthly.
With base rates at only 6 per cent at the time of launch and promising to
fall further, investors have been happy to pour money into the new Pep, even
though the offer sounds too good to be true.
A higher return usually means higher risk, but Hypo F&amp;C believes it has used
a structure which, though complicated, explains how it can provide the
higher yield.
Around half the portfolio is invested in blue-chip shares, which provide a
modest income; but the extra income, which pushes the return on the Pep
above most alternative plans, comes from options.
An option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell
a commodity at a given price over a given period. In return, the buyer pays
a premium to the option seller. A 'call' option gives the purchaser the
right to buy a commodity, and a 'put' option gives the right to sell.
The Hypo F&amp;C unit trust writes both call and put options against the shares
it owns. The premiums it earns by writing the options boost the yield on the
trust up to 10 per cent (after charges), which is tax-free for those who
hold it in Pep form.
The trust also buys a put option on the FT-SE 100 index, to give it
protection against a sharp fall in the stock market.
Morgan Grenfell followed Hypo F&amp;C's lead, and in October launched its High
Income Trust which also pays 10 per cent a year, tax-free in a Pep with
income paid quarterly. There is also a 7 per cent option.
What are the risks? In December, Save &amp; Prosper, which had been working on a
similar product, suddenly decided to withdraw it because it said that its
models showed a significant risk of capital erosion.
Both Hypo F&amp;C and Morgan Grenfell outlined the risks in a subsequent
statement: 'These funds should not be confused with guaranteed funds; the
two funds are actively managed according to market conditions. Neither the
income, nor the level of capital, is guaranteed.'
John Spiers, of BESt Pep, says: 'My main worry about these Peps is that they
are fine in a rising market, but what about a falling market?'
Since the funds give other investors the right to buy their shares, these
options are unlikely to be exercised if the stock market goes down. There is
the protection against a sharp fall in the market, but in a lengthy decline
the funds' incomes from premiums will fall, leading to the risk that capital
and income cannot be maintained.
In a fast-rising market, the funds will underperform their rivals, since, by
selling options on their shares, they are giving up capital gain. The funds
are likely to do best in a slowly rising stock market.
Charges on both these unit trusts are 5 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent
annually, with no extra charge for the Pep. The minimum deposit is Pounds
2,500, but is lower for those choosing the 7 per cent option on the Morgan
Grenfell plan, at Pounds 2,000.
This year, there has been a new twist to the high-income tale with the
revival of unit trust withdrawal plans in Pep form, allowing investors to
make regular withdrawals to supplement their income.
Newton's Distributor Fund is a recently launched unit trust, investing in
equities and bonds. There is a Pep facility at no extra cost beyond the 6
per cent initial charge and 1.5 per cent annual fee which allows investors
to select a regular 'distribution' of up to 9 per cent, paid quarterly.
Newton says that it believes it can, over a three-year rolling period,
replace the value, in real terms, of the capital which is distributed.
Investors who are worried about capital erosion can opt for lower
distributions at 3, 5 and 7 per cent. The minimum Pep investment is Pounds
3,000.
James Capel's Generator Pep is attached to its UK Tracker fund, which
attempts to match the performance of the FT-SE A All-Share index. It has
capped the payout at 7.5 per cent, and investors can choose lower payout
levels. Charges are an initial 5.25 per cent initial with an annual fee of 1
per cent, which is higher than the 0.5 per cent annual charge on a direct
investment in the underlying fund. The minimum lump sum investment in both
Peps is Pounds 3,000.
The advantage of these funds is that the investor is theoretically in
control, so that if the stock market falls, they can stop taking income in
order to minimise capital erosion. However, in practice, many people may
find they cannot afford to do this because they have become dependent on the
income stream.
John Spiers says: 'I'm not keen on distribution unit trusts, because the
person wanting income needs to know that it is sustainable. Also Newton's
annual charge of 1.5 per cent on a fund which is 30 per cent invested in
bonds is ridiculously high.'
Other high-yielding investments are the income shares of split-capital
investment trusts. Exeter High Income unit trust invests in these shares,
and is available in a Pep run by Guinness Flight under the name Investment
Trust Selector Income Pep. The yield has fallen from about 11 per cent in
early 1993 but is still high at about 8 per cent currently. However, you
cannot also expect substantial capital growth.
Exeter High Income is in the UK Equity income sector, and was ranked 53 out
of 94 funds in the five years to February 1, and 101 out of 104 funds over
three years (offer to bid, income reinvested, source: HSW). The percentage
growth over those years is 62.4 per cent and 38.4 per cent respectively. The
initial charge is 5.5 per cent, and the annual management fee is 1.5 per
cent. The minimum lump-sum investment is Pounds 3,000 and payouts are
quarterly.
Other Peps with high yields include those investing in bonds or high
yielding equities, such as Cazenove's utility and bond fund.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Death duty and Peps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When I die, what will happen with regard to tax on my various personal
equity plans? Will my beneficiaries - most likely my wife - have to pay the
tax on: 1. All future capital gains and dividends from the date of my death;
2. All capital gains and dividends from the start of the tax year in which I
die; 3. All capital gains and dividends retrospectively to the dates when
each Pep was purchased?
Upon your death, the personal equity plan, which is a scheme of investments,
ceases to qualify for beneficial tax treatment, writes Barry Stillerman. As
regards capital gains, your beneficiaries will take over the assets at
probate value and will be subject to CGT on any increase in value from your
death. The Pep holding will not attract CGT by reason of your death.
The income from the assets in the plan will attract income tax from the date
of your death. For example, if you were to die on September 30, you would be
subject to income tax on any income up to that period.
The executors pay tax on income during the administration period and, once
the assets in your estate (including the Pep assets) have been distributed
to the beneficiaries, they pay income tax on any future income received.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividends on scrip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have taken cash for the immediate sale of enhanced scrip dividends but am
not clear as to the basis of assessment for capital gains tax. I have read
comments that enhanced scrip dividends are to be treated as full-paid rights
issues and pooled.
If they have been sold immediately, however, will a sale come under the
provisions of the 10-day in-and-out rule?
Yes, UK scrip dividends are treated in much the same way as rights issues.
No, the 10-day rule does not apply (it applies only 'if, within a period of
10 days, a number of securities are acquired and subsequently a number of
securities are disposed of.' Section 127 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains
Act 1992 says that a scrip dividend 'shall not be treated as involving . . .
any acquisition of the new holding or any part of it').
The fact that the market value of scrip cannot be determined until after it
has been sold does not matter - any more than the fact that the indexation
relief due on a profit-making sale cannot be calculated until the middle of
the following month, when the relevant RPI is published by the Central
Office of Information. CGT is calculated according to arbitrary rules laid
down by MPs, with scant regard for logic or equity.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (the indexation allowance
for quoted shares). You could also write to the Inland Revenue Public
Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB for a free copy of
Budget press release IR28 (Capital gains: indexation allowance and capital
losses).

FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax levy on trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My husband died five months ago and left his estate in trust. The trustees
are myself and another person who is a named beneficiary. On my death, the
trust fund is to be distributed to our four children. 1. What is the tax
position of such a fund? 2. Can the trust continue to benefit from the tax
advantages of a Tessa account, Pep etc. 3. Are there any constraints in the
management of such a trust?
I am assuming you are provided with a life interest so that all the income
from the trust fund during your lifetime will accrue to you; and that, on
your death, the fund is distributed equally to your children, writes Barry
Stillerman.
If this is correct, then there will be no inheritance tax to pay on your
husband's death. There would, however, be IHT on the entire trust fund on
your death.
If your husband has not utilised the nil rate band, you might wish to
consider a deed of variation so that up to Pounds 150,000 of assets are
passed to your children now.
As only individuals can invest in Peps and Tessas, these tax-efficient
investments are not available to trusts.
Unless there are specific conditions in the trust deed, the only constraints
would be those provided by parliament in the various acts regulating the
behaviour of trustees.

I am a retired widower and in June 1990 was left a property valued around
Pounds 85,000 at probate. When I die, I know my estate will be liable for
death duties of perhaps Pounds 40,000.
I have two daughters and I am considering transferring the above property to
one or both. Is conveyancing necessary in this case and if so, can I attempt
it myself?
We assume that the property is not your private residence and can,
accordingly, be gifted to your daughter without the gifts-with-reservation
rules applying.
If you occupy that property in the future, you will need to pay market rent
to your daughter to avoid these rules applying. The gift of the property
would be a potentially exempt transfer. Inheritance tax might be an issue if
you were to die within seven years of making the gift.
If you transfer the property to your daughters now, you could create a
capital gains tax charge. The gain which you would realise would be the
excess of the market value at the time of the gift over the probate value,
reduced by indexation allowance (for inflation) since June 1990.
In the present property climate, the market value at the time of the gift
might not be greatly different from the probate value. Hence, your gain
could be small and covered by annual exemption of Pounds 5,800.
Alternatively, you might realise a loss. I suggest you get the property
valued to see if CGT would be payable.
Conveyancing is necessary in the case of a gift. This can be done by you but
it is normally better to ask a professional adviser to help. No stamp duty
is payable in the case of a gift of land.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: If you like it, then go for it -
That's the message on investment trusts from one analyst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Investment trusts seem to have entered a topsy-turvy world where discounts
have become premiums and it is cheaper to invest through a new or a C-share
issue than to buy shares in an existing trust. So says analyst Robin Angus
in NatWest Securities' annual review of the investment trust sector.
The past year has been a boom time for investment trusts. Their performance
has outshone unit trusts; more and more private investors have been taking
their first plunge into the sector; and discounts have narrowed rapidly. But
Angus, although generally bullish, sounds a few notes of caution.
'The performance edge which investment trusts have enjoyed over unit trusts
has not come from widely differing net asset total return performances,' he
says. 'It has come mostly from the narrowing of the discount. And that is
something which cannot happen twice.' And while he does not think discounts
are about to disappear for good, he does not believe they will return to the
20 or 30 per cent level of a decade or so ago.
'I am not saying that trusts are bad value,' Angus says. 'But now, with
conventionally structure trusts, it is all down to the gearing and the low
management costs, and to the performance of the underlying assets.' The
message is blunt: Pick your trust - and its manager - carefully.
'Don't pile into the sector indiscriminately,' Angus cautions. 'Discounts
are too low for that and there are risks involved if the market takes a
quick, sudden tumble.' But he adds, too, that his old prejudice against new
issues and C-shares has disappeared. 'If it's big, liquid and you like it,
go for it.'
Angus says the future development of the investment trust industry should
focus on 'life-style needs' where savings products are provided for
pensions, house purchases, school fees and private medicine. This is already
starting to happen - Foreign &amp; Colonial recently launched an investment
trust pension - but there are still huge, unexploited opportunities.
Meanwhile, the new issues keep on flowing. Two of the latest may be of
interest to investors who are looking to extend their portfolio into
formerly uncharted - and still risky - territory.
The public offer is now open for the Israel fund, a dollar-denominated,
UK-listed investment trust managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. It closes on
March 3. The fund will invest in stocks listed on the Tel Aviv exchange, or
Israeli companies listed elsewhere.
This is the first single-country fund for Israel available readily to UK
private investors except for a very small Luxembourg-registered unit trust
from Svecia, marketed through Skandia Life. Minimum subscription to the
Israel fund is Pounds 1,000 and ordinary shares are offered at Dollars 1,
with one warrant (exercisable May 1995 to 2004) attached to every five
shares.
Another fund which fills a previously empty niche for UK investors is the CS
First Boston Central European Growth fund. It plans to invest mainly in the
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to take advantage of what its managers
expect to be the fastest growing economies in Europe over the next five to
10 years.
The public offer opened yesterday and closes on March 11. Ordinary shares
are on offer at Dollars 1, with one warrant (exercisable between April 1995
and 1999) attached to every five shares. Minimum subscription is Pounds
1,000. Issue expenses mean the Dollars 1 shares will have an initial net
asset value of 96.2 cents. Annual management fee will be 1.25 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - What the experts say
(8): Peps need thought - do you want growth, income or total return? / A
decision taken in haste is liable to be regretted later. On these pages we
invite three financial advisers each to suggest plans and providers, to meet
three types of requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
People tend to leave tax-planning to the last minute. One of the
disadvantages of leaving things too late is that you have less time in which
to choose from the myriad Peps available. A snap decision could be one that
you come to regret, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
Some investors may want the Pep to pay off the mortgage; others may want it
primarily for income; while younger investors may feel in a position to be
more speculative with their Pep investment. It is therefore a good idea to
take independent, preferably fee-based, financial advice before choosing.
We asked three experts to select three different types of Pep to meet the
varying needs. One is for income, one for aggressive capital growth, and one
for more conservative growth or total return.
Robert Noble-Warren, of advisers Murray Noble, says: 'We prefer to buy
self-select Peps, because we find the charges are lower.' He favours
self-select Peps at two stockbrokers: Charles Stanley, with an initial
charge of Pounds 29, and an annual 0.75 per cent fee; and Pilling &amp; Co,
which has no initial or annual charge, but levies Pounds 6.75 per dividend
payment.
The strategy underpinning Noble Warren's Pep selection is that there are
better returns on deposit, in fixed interest and emerging markets than in
the developed markets of the US, UK and Japan.
CONSERVATIVE GROWTH: 'A large proportion of the Pep - 40 per cent - would be
invested in cash, to obtain 5 per cent gross interest,' says Noble-Warren.
Although the Inland Revenue would view unfavourably Peps used with the
intention of sheltering cash, it is possible to switch into cash before
buying equities without Revenue disapproval.
About half the Pep would be invested in the zero-dividend preference shares
of investment trusts. 'Care is needed in selecting zeros, because you need
to match the redemption date to the cash need of the investor. Otherwise,
when interest rates rise and the investor tries to encash, there will be a
loss of capital.'
Noble-Warren likes the zeros of Olim and Finsbury Smaller Companies. 'I've
chosen Olim, even though the cover is relatively low at above one times
covered, because of its excellent long-term performance; while Finsbury
Smaller Companies zero is one of the safest around, and is more than two
times covered.
'I would put the 10 per cent balance of the Pep into two emerging markets
investment trusts. Foreign &amp; Colonial is one of the most reputable names in
the business. The other fund is Latin American Trust, because, within
emerging markets, I prefer exposure to Latin America rather than the Far
East. With the North America Free Trade Agreement in place, Latin America
should benefit from exposure to the US market.'
AGGRESSIVE GROWTH: 'No cash in this one. Instead, 50 per cent in the same
zeros as for the conservative growth Pep. I think the UK market is going to
be less risky than the US, so another 25 per cent would go into UK equities
through Fidelity's Special Situations unit trust, which has shown
consistently good performance. I'd put 10 per cent in the Latin American
Trust and, for a wider spread of emerging markets, another 15 per cent in
Gartmore Emerging Pacific.'
INCOME: Cash once again plays an important part in the income Pep.
Noble-Warren says he would hold half in cash and the rest in the income
shares of spilt-capital investment trusts. 'I would invest 40 per cent in
New Throgmorton income shares, which are yielding about 9 per cent, or in
River and Mercantile. The remaining 10 per cent would go into M&amp;G's Second
Dual Income shares, which are yielding 20 per cent. This level of yield is
often at the expense of capital but the income is very worthwhile.'
Andrew Teasdale, of Shepherd Associates, bemoans the fact that the end of
the tax year prompts Pep investment regardless of the state of the market.
'Tax should never be the principal factor in investment timing,' he says.
'For many investors, it would be safer to invest on a monthly basis through
a savings scheme, even if this means forgoing some of this year's Pep
allowance.' He advises investors to avoid fund managers that make an
additional charge for their Pep.
CONSERVATIVE GROWTH: 'For the investor who wants total return without
above-average risk, I would recommend an index-fund Pep, such as the James
Capel or Morgan Grenfell UK index funds. Schroder UK Equity is also a
possibility, while the comparable European fund would be Baring European
Growth. If the investor wants balanced growth, M&amp;G General, Gartmore British
Growth, Fidelity UK Growth, M&amp;G European and General and Henderson European
are all good funds.'
AGGRESSIVE GROWTH: 'The investor who wants a potentially higher return, with
a higher level of risk, should choose a fund with a higher allocation to
smaller and medium-sized companies. Here, I would recommend M&amp;G Recovery,
Fidelity Special Situations or Edinburgh Smaller Companies. For
international exposure, the investor can choose between Perpetual Growth and
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust. Many of the competitive investment
trusts - for example, Foreign &amp; Colonial  -
either do not have a Pep link or limit investment to a maximum of Pounds
1,500.'
INCOME: 'I do not favour high-income products for Pep investments, due to
the lack of control over the rate of potential capital depreciation. The
bottom of an interest-rate and the top of a market cycle is the wrong time
to go chasing income. My recommendations are M&amp;G Dividend, Schroder Income,
Morgan Grenfell UK Equity Income. European choices would include M&amp;G
European Dividend and Fidelity European Income.
'If the investor wants a higher-risk, higher-return income portfolio, he or
she can consider Perpetual Income/High Income, Credit Suisse Income, M&amp;G
Equity Income and GT Smaller Companies Dividend and Martin Currie
International Income fund.
James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe, makes the following choices:
CONSERVATIVE GROWTH: 'This category is a bit of a catch-all, but the fund
that I think offers the best value and potential growth is the Alliance
Trust Pep. Alliance Trust itself is one of the biggest and most successful
international investment trusts. It is too widely invested, though, and does
not fully qualify as a Pep investment.
'So, while the first Pounds 1,500 can go into the Alliance and/or second
Alliance trusts, the balance of your money can go into a wide range of
alternative investment trusts, including Edinburgh, Scottish Mortgage,
Witan, Law Debenture and Electric &amp; General. This is a very attractive list
of alternatives.
'The charges are minimal (dealing charges of up to 0.25 per cent) so this
plan is very cost-effective. The drawback is that they can only deal during
limited periods of the month: but as these are long-term investments, this
is not actually a problem.'
AGGRESSIVE GROWTH: 'My recommendation at the moment is the newly-launched
Mercury European Privatisation trust. The public offer closes on March 2.
Not only should this have merit as a long-term European blue chip investment
fund, but it will be possible, in the opening 42-day period, to renounce the
warrants into a Pep as well as the ordinary shares. If the fund performs,
these warrants will have the effect of greatly gearing up the capital
return.
'I would recommend using a self-select Pep (which does not carry an annual
percentage charge) such as Killik's for the exercise, because Mercury will
have an annual Pep manager's charge of 1 per cent plus VAT on top of the
underlying trust's charge. Killik &amp; Co will charge their usual dealing
charge of 1.65 per cent (minimum Pounds 40) for the renunciation, and then
Pounds 7.50 for each dividend to reclaim tax.'
INCOME: 'When looking for income from equity-based collective funds, one has
to work from the start-point of the yield on FT-SE 100 or the All-Share -
not much more than 3 per cent. Yields can be increased by greater exposure
to riskier smaller companies, or by the use of bonds or convertibles. These
are fairly straightforward investments, which do not involve much in the way
of gearing.
'Then there are the hybrids, such as Hypo F&amp;C's high-income Pep, in which
there is a danger that capital will be eroded. The new James Capel
'generator' unit trust Pep is an interesting departure - it offers a pay-out
(not income) of 5 per cent or 7.5 per cent, which explicitly adds capital to
yield to generate an overall return.
'As long as the investor is fully aware that they are simply taking capital
back as the 'income', and as long as this pay-out does not continue to be
taken during a period of falling equity prices, then this vehicle should
prove popular.
'In the past, we have been enthusiasts about the income shares of
split-capital investment trusts within self-select Peps. The very high yield
maximises the tax efficiency of the investment and makes greatest use of the
Pep vehicle.
'However, these investments are more volatile than ordinary shares of
investment trusts or unit trusts, because of the way they gear up the income
on the portfolio. At the moment, because of potential volatility in the
equity markets, I would be happier to invest in a straight trust that offers
a reasonably high yield, such as Morgan Grenfell's Equity Income investment
trust (or its unit trust sister). Other contenders are Newton's and GT's
income unit trusts.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Where freedom is everything -
Insurance for Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funds under management at Scottish Widows exceed Pounds 21bn, which makes
the society the third-largest mutual in terms of asset size. The power it
exerts in the life and pensions industry has led to the label 'Scottish
mafia,' which it shares with two other mutuals north of the border, Standard
Life and Scottish Amicable.
In terms of financial strength - a key feature in any long-term investment
provider - the society was awarded Standard &amp; Poor's top assessment because
of its strong free asset position and initiatives taken to improve
efficiency and quality of service. As a proportion of total assets, the
level of free assets indicates how much capital is available for development
as opposed to assets set aside to meet liabilities to policyholders. The
free asset ratio is an important indicator for mutuals since, unlike
proprietary life offices, they cannot go to the stock market to raise
capital.
Scottish Widows has free assets worth more than Pounds 2bn, which is 20 per
cent greater than the average of the top 10 mutuals. Managing director Mike
Ross says: 'A strong financial position enables us to maximise the
investment freedom which we can give to our investment managers. Greater
investment freedom means greater policyholder returns over the longer term.'
Nevertheless, the society's performance has dived in recent years. Poor
performance has hit its most popular funds - conventional with-profits,
managed unit-linked, and equity unit-linked.
The with-profits story reflects the problems that have beset the entire
sector. With-profits funds aim to achieve a good but steady return through
investment in gilts, fixed interest, property and equities. Part of the
return is guaranteed; hence the attraction for investors seeking a degree of
security.
For some time, the society has ploughed a substantial proportion of its
with-profits fund into equities and property. But poor historic returns on
property have affected all with-profits funds, while the 50 per cent equity
exposure on the Widows' fund has had a relatively heavy weighting towards
FT-SE 100 stocks at a time when smaller companies have shown better
performance.
The society's conventional with-profits fund has returned below-average
results over five, 10 and 15 years, although it remains one of the top
performers in its category over 20 years.
The society's more recent unitised with-profits plan has performed above
average since launch. But the managed unit-linked fund, which offers a mixed
portfolio of investments, has been below average over the past five years
after peaking in 1989, when it was among the top performers in its category.
In 1992 and 1993, it fell into the bottom 25 per cent.
Market analysts say the society has taken steps to rectify its investment
problems, but it is too early to see the results.
Charges are an important feature of any investment plan, and Scottish
Widows' personal pensions offer below-average charges on all lengths of
contract, according to its reduction in yield (RIY) figures - that is, the
equivalent annual charge over the full period the policy is in force
(source: FT 1994 Personal Pensions Handbook and Pensions Management).
Where commission is paid to advisers, the society deducts an extra 30 per
cent from premiums paid during the initial period. This can be anything up
to 27 months, depending on the term of the contract.
With the importance of independent advice increasingly being recognised, it
is perhaps surprising that Scottish Widows is increasing its direct sales
operation from 5 to 20 per cent by 1998. Independent advisers are
responsible for 95 per cent of business now while tied agents, who sell the
products of a single provider, account for only 3 per cent.
The society monitors its tied agents carefully following a fine by the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) of Pounds 100,000
for 'incorrect advice.'
Sales of personal pension transfer plans to employees with company scheme
benefits also are monitored carefully. The society has sold 35,000 transfer
plans, more than 50 per cent of which were cases where the company pension
scheme was being terminated.

Funds under management: Pounds 21.8bn (at 5/1/94)
Premium income: Pounds 1,786m in 1992 (life and pensions)
Number of personal pension plan clients: 450,000
Sales outlets: 95 per cent through independent advisers, 5 per cent

Commission paid: Average life office rates to independent advisers,
eg between approx 47 per cent and 60 per cent of the first year's
premiums on a 20-year contract
Nil commission terms available? Yes, through any adviser or tied agent.
Where commission foregone, a greater proportion of premium actually
invested in plan
Recurring single premiums? Yes
Expense ratio (management expenses divided by total premium income):
20.15 per cent in 1991, 18.12 per cent in 1992 (industry average last
calculated in 1991 at 19.3 per cent)
Reduction in yield 1993* (equivalent annual per cent charge over the
life of the contract): 1.5 per cent on 25 year unit-linked personal
pension (industry average 1.6 per cent). Below average on most
contracts and terms)
Penalties on early retirement or termination: On new unit-linked
plans - no penalties; with-profits plans, a discretionary 'market
value adjuster' (MVA) penalty may be imposed
Performance*: Sharp decline on managed unit-linked fund since 1989
and on equity fund since 1991. Unitised with-profits above average
over five years, conventional with-profits good over 20 years but
below average for shorter periods.
Charges: Life office illustrations of what your investment may produce
use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance and
Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real
charges on the final fund of Scottish Widows' managed unit-linked
plan, we asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45
who expects to retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a)
pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of
pounds 10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in
fact are lower than those used by most life offices, are shown in
brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges
were deducted.

As can be seen, where full commission is paid, Scottish Widows' charges
are significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a lower
projected return. When the commission cost is stripped out, the reverse
is true on the monthly premium plan but not on the single premium
contract.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pick up a P-P-Pib . . . -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu follows the fortunes of a popular investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As prices of bonds and other fixed-interest investments have fallen,
permanent-interest bearing shares (Pibs) have not been immune from the drop.
These are issued by building societies to raise capital but, in spite of
their name, are not the type of share that gives investors a slice of a
company's assets. Instead, they are loans from the investor to the society.
They have been popular with private investors because of the relatively high
income they can provide, even though the Pibs market is relatively small and
illiquid - the sort of market in which institutions rather than individuals
are more usually to be found.
The table shows the coupon and present yields on Pibs. Gross yields of 9.16
per cent to more than 11 per cent are attractive to income-seekers at a time
when base rates are 5.25 per cent. Also, Pibs held directly are exempt from
capital gains tax.
The level of income, however, is a reflection of greater risk. Pibs offer
higher yields than gilts because building societies are less secure than the
government. And they are irredeemable, which means there is no repayment
date: hence the name 'permanent interest-bearing.' Investors can get back
their capital only by selling in the stock market - where prices fluctuate.
In addition, Pibs are deeply subordinated. This means that if the building
society were to collapse, investors in Pibs would rank behind all other
lenders, depositors and shareholders for repayment. There is no compensation
scheme to protect them, either.
Investors in Pibs have been experiencing ups and downs over the past few
weeks. 'Pibs have suffered recently, with prices falling in excess of gilt
prices as retail investors look to take profits,' says Simon Mozley, of
Hoare Govett.
Some Pibs have suffered more than others. 'Issues by North of England and
Newcastle have been held predominantly by private individuals and the
shortage of stock has meant that, historically, they have been on very tight
spreads,' adds Mozley, referring to the difference in buying and selling
prices.
'It is not surprising that they have seen the most extreme price fall with
no institutional support. Issues by the Halifax and Leeds have shown the
least underperformance, reflecting the strong institutional holding.'
Should those holding Pibs be worried about the fall in prices? A look at the
table shows that if most investors bought them at face value, they would be
sitting on a reasonable profit in capital appreciation terms. But Pibs tend
to be bought by private individuals for the income they provide, not as
speculative instruments for capital growth.
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'Obviously, Pibs are
interest-rate sensitive and there has been a wonderful run of capital
appreciation. I believe we are at or near the bottom of the interest rate
cycle. As interest rates climb, the value of Pibs will fall; but if you
bought Pibs for the income stream, you should ignore the underlying
fluctuating capital value.'
Although Boyton does not advise selling the Pibs, at the moment he prefers
stepped preference shares for those who want a steady income. These are
company shares earning a pre-determined income which rises steadily by a set
amount each year to the winding-up date.
Simon John Knott, head of private client research at stockbroker Greig
Middleton, also does not think those holding Pibs should be panicked into
selling them. 'We are still expecting a fall in interest rates, and the 9
per cent yield you can get on Pibs is very attractive, especially if you are
in a high-quality society. We always recommend that the society be in the
top 10.'
The societies listed in the table which are in the top 10 by asset size are
Halifax, Leeds, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Britannia, and
Bristol &amp; West. Many private investors may be unable (or reluctant) to buy
the minimum holding of Pounds 50,000 for Halifax, Leeds and C&amp;G Pibs. The
minimum investment in Bradford &amp; Bingley Pibs is Pounds 10,000, while the
most affordable Pibs are those of Britannia and Bristol &amp; West (the ninth
and 10th-largest societies) with a minimum Pounds 1,000 holding.
'If you choose the right Pibs, it is an excellent way to lock into high
returns for the long-term,' says Knott. 'But if rates start to go up, your
capital losses will be higher than for gilts.'
Since the only way to get back your capital is to sell in the market, there
is always the danger that the price could be lower than what you paid.
Investors who appreciate both the advantages and drawbacks of Pibs, and need
income, can continue to hold them as part of a wider investment portfolio.
Those who have not been aware of the risks, or who want to preserve their
capital against the danger of a steep fall in prices, may prefer to consider
selling them. But they should take financial advice before doing so.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the reporting season gets under way, there has been a pick-up in
directors' activity.
Kleen-e-Ze has appeared several times in this column. In December 1992,
directors picked up a considerable amount of stock around the 20p mark. Now,
after a period of outperformance, more stock has been sold by RM Klein, the
chairman and chief executive, - bringing his total disposals since the share
price started rising to more than 820,000. But the sale was specifically to
satisfy a family trust purchase of the outstanding equity in a company
called Exclu. He retains more than 1.2m shares in Kleen-e-Ze.
London &amp; Clydeside Holdings has been affected (like other property
companies) by the recession. But directors have been particularly good at
selling at the optimum moment. The last record of their activity was when
three sold at prices around 145p in spring 1991. In March 1993, we noted one
director buying at 55p; now, a year later, we see one selling at 145p.
Vardon, the leisure company, appears in both the buy and sell section. The
sale was made by two directors in order to satisfy capital gains allowances
following the acquisition of their family firm by Vardon last year. The
purchases were made by the chairman and chief executive and increased their
holdings considerably.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pensions: how they rate - Debbie
Harrison looks at the best and worst performers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of employees do not have access to a good company pension scheme.
Thus, they should consider the most tax-efficient investment alternative - a
personal pension plan.
With more than 100 providers to chose from, each offering a big choice of
funds, the latest survey on personal pensions from Money Management*, a
sister publication of the Financial Times, provides a useful guide to two of
the key features: performance and charges.
The most popular personal pension investment options for consumers are the
with-profits and the managed unit-linked funds. The fortunes of these
different investment styles vary according to market conditions, so the
choice should be based on your attitude to risk rather than the latest
comparative results.
With-profits funds comprise equities, fixed interest and gilts and offer
certain guarantees as well as a smoothed investment return.
Under a unit-linked personal pension, the performance of the units you buy
with your contributions mirrors the performance of the underlying fund and
is, therefore, likely to be more volatile. The managed fund usually is
invested in a range of the provider's main funds.
Although the tables show five-year performance, it is important to look at
results over a longer period to assess consistency. Unfortunately, the
survey found that there was very little consistency in with-profits results
over the four periods analysed: five, 10, 15 and 20 years.
Best overall were Clerical Medical, Co-operative insurance, National Mutual
Life, Norwich Union, Equitable Life, Pearl, Prudential, Royal London and
Wesleyan &amp; General.
Figures from Axa Equity &amp; Law, Scottish Life and Sun Life, although mainly
in the top quartile (top 25 per cent) and middle ranks, were each let down
by a bottom quartile figure for a particular period.
There is, however, more consistency when it comes to the laggards which
rarely struggled out of the bottom quartile. Britannia Life, Royal Life,
Guardian Assurance, National Provident and Scottish Mutual all fall into
this category.
Most managed unit-linked funds gave results over five years only and table 2
shows the best for this period. Several funds missed the top 10 by just a
few pounds: these include Rothschild Asset Management, Equitable Life,
Norwich Union and Scottish Equitable.
The survey notes that Gartmore, one of the few unit trust personal pension
providers, has impressive results but also is one of the highest chargers.
At the bottom of the five-year ranks are Confederation Life (a good
performer over 10 and 15 years), Eagle Star (Advent fund), Irish Life (but
good results on single-premium investments) and Laurentian Life
(consistently awful).
Many people with personal pension plans invest at least part of their money
in particular sectors. Looking at consistency of performance over the
complete range of unit-linked funds, the top results are shown by National
Mutual, Scottish Equitable, Equitable Life, Norwich Union and Scottish
Amicable.
At the bottom of the heap, three companies show up particularly badly in
this survey: Laurentian Life, Scottish Life and Scottish Mutual.
Other companies with unit-linked results that leave something to be desired
include Aegon, Axa Equity &amp; Law, Barclays Life, Black Horse Life, Friends
Provident, Hill Samuel, Merchant Investors, Providence Capitol, Scottish
Provident, Scottish Widows and Sun Alliance.
Table 3 shows the best buys in terms of good consistent performance married
with low charges. 'The reason the list is so short is that most of the top
performers have above-average charges . . . and low chargers have less than
stunning performance,' the survey says.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Managed PEPs (7): Still
popular - with the rich / Easing of limits on pooled funds has been a
setback to a once-favoured vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although managed Peps were once a core product, many people in the
investment industry now feel that they have been overtaken by history and
become yesterday's investment.
When Peps were launched, in 1987, only Pounds 420 of the permitted Pounds
2,400 annual investment could be placed in a unit trust or investment trust.
The favoured Pep vehicle, therefore, was a managed portfolio of a handful of
shares, sometimes with the satellite addition of a small unit trust or
investment trust holding.
However, over the next five years the permitted exposure to pooled funds was
gradually increased, until in 1992 all restrictions were removed and the
full annual Pep contribution could be invested in a unit trust or investment
trust.
This new freedom prompted an immediate reaction from many investment houses.
Roger Cornick, a director of Perpetual Unit Trust Management, says: 'We
stopped doing managed Peps, which were expensive to run, when it became
possible to invest everything in unit trusts. I think managed Peps are for
people who own their own shares in their own companies, and want to shelter
a single line of stock; or for sophisticated customers who believe they can
outperform fund managers. Otherwise I cannot think of a category of investor
they suit.'
Peter Pearson Lund, managing director of Gartmore Fund Managers, is even
more forthright: 'I don't think the managed Pep vehicle has a future,
because it can't give enough spread.'
Like Perpetual, Gartmore ceased marketing a managed Pep when the restriction
on unit trust Pep investments was lifted.
Save &amp; Prosper, however, had invested heavily in the necessary systems; it
has continued to keep faith with its managed Pep and now has Pounds 468m
under management. But while Ken Emery, S&amp;P's investment products technical
manager, says the vehicle has been very successful in both performance and
marketing terms, he admits: 'If we were starting now, with a blank piece of
paper, we would not have a managed Pep.'
He explains: 'The combination of Inland Revenue's regulations and the SROs'
(self-regulatory organisations) regulations make it so complicated, and that
makes it expensive. The rules and regulations also make it difficult to
manage the portfolio effectively. I think the pooled vehicle will become the
Pep for the average investor. Peps are perfect long-term savings vehicles,
and it is difficult to offer a savings scheme on a managed portfolio.'
Fred Carr, managing director of stockbroker WI Carr, still runs his managed
Pep, but not with much enthusiasm: 'We don't think it is justifiable from
the cost point of view to take clients out of perfectly good equities. But
we haven't put any new money in for a long time. Nowadays, we would tend to
use the fund route, although clients could argue that you have a double
layer of management charges. Whether this makes up for the lower risk, time
will tell.'
Although managed Peps have fallen out of fashion, they continue to be
popular with a number of wealthy or sophisticated investors. As Jain
Castiau, assistant marketing director of Barclays Financial Services, points
out: 'We thought that the managed Pep was a product past its sell-by date,
but the latest Inland Revenue figures show surprisingly little drop in
support.' The figures reveal that, while the overall percentage of managed
peps has decreased, overall contributions rose Pounds 6.7bn to Pounds 11.1bn
in the 1992-1993 tax year.
Barclays has 13,500 managed Pep investors, and Pounds 120m invested in its
managed plan, or just over 10 per cent of its total Pep funds under
management. But the bank takes some care to cherry-pick the customers to
whom it markets this vehicle.
Castiau says: 'We see a managed Pep as a niche product for customers who
have a particular affinity with shares. We have found that those customers
who are used to buying shares actually like to see a handful of shares in
their Pep.'
Some suggest that the modern successor to the managed Pep will be the 'fund
of funds' Pep, a vehicle which invests in a basket of unit trusts and which
is growing in popularity. For example, M&amp;G now has more than Pounds 250m
invested in its Managed Income Pep, while Fidelity has just launched a
similar vehicle, linked to its Moneybuilder unit trust.
Judy Delaforce, Fidelity's Product Development Manager, says: 'The
Moneybuilder Pep holds about 12 different unit trusts. We think you get the
ultimate diversification by this method, even for the investor who can only
afford a contribution of Pounds 50 a month.'
But, for most investors, a managed Pep means a portfolio of shares, managed
on a discretionary basis, and either standing alone in the Pep, or with a
satellite unit trust or investment trust. And there continues to be no lack
of choice for those who are attracted to such a vehicle. There are more than
30 'share only' managed Peps listed in brokers Chase de Vere's latest guide,
and probably three times as many plans that offer an exposure to shares,
plus either a unit trust or an investment trust.
The important question is: how do prospective investors make a choice?
Certainly they should ask about charges - the performance will need to be
very good if the management fees are much, if any, higher than those charged
on a unit trust or investment trust Pep - and they should also ask about the
number, as well as the quality, of the holdings.
The criticism of managed Peps has always been that they do not provide a
sufficient spread of risk - Pounds 6,000 hardly buys a balanced portfolio of
shares - but new investors should inquire whether the number of shares
(which will probably only be five or six at the outset) increases in line
with any increase in the size of the Pep holding.
However, the key factor is performance; and the central difficulty when
selecting a managed Pep is to gauge how similar investments have performed.
As the gurus at Chase de Vere concede in their new Pep Guide: 'It is not
possible to produce meaningful comparative figures for managed share
portfolios or for the older style of Peps, which are made up of a
combination of managed shares and unit or investment trusts.'
So prospective investors must interrogate individual investment managers.
The best of them will monitor their performance internally, and should be
happy to provide details of how existing clients have fared.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Split-Capital Trusts
(6): An investment pick 'n' mix - But only for those who know what they're
doing, warns Bethan Hutton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Split-capital investment trusts frighten off many investors with their
complexity. This is a shame, because, used properly, they can fulfil some
very common financial planning needs.
Split-capital trusts, like any other investment trust, are limited companies
which invest in other companies to provide a return to their shareholders.
The difference with split-capital trusts is that, rather than issuing just
one class of ordinary share, and distributing the fund's income and capital
growth equally between them, they issue two or more types of share, which
lay claim to different parts of the trusts assets and dividends.
Common classes of share are:
Zero-dividend preference shares, which offer a predictable annual return in
the form of capital growth, but receive no dividends along the way;
Capital shares, which take all the capital gains after the zeros have had
their entitlement; and
Income shares, which receive the lion's share of the dividends, but are at
the back of the queue for capital gains. Occasionally, income shares are
designed to act like annuities, paying out both income and your original
capital, and ending up worth little or nothing.
Some trusts also have such hybrids as stepped preference shares - which have
an entitlement to income and/or capital gains growing a fixed amount every
year - and ordinary income shares, which mainly pay out the trust's dividend
income, but have more of a claim on the trust's assets than standard income
shares. Every trust is different in its structure.
The attraction of this division of functions is that investors can pick the
type of share which fits their requirements exactly. If, for example, you
need income, and are not worried about capital growth, you can buy income
shares that will pay you a fixed amount each year, and return your capital
along the way or at the end. Or, if you are working and do not need income
from your investment, but are looking for steady capital growth, zeros could
be just the thing.
The wind-up date for split capital trusts is fixed from the outset. As
people know both the redemption price of zero-dividend shares and the price
today, they can easily calculate the annualised gross redemption yield - the
final profit in terms of growth each year.
The different winding-up dates can be useful. For example, for school-fees
planning: you could buy a series of zeros from trusts with wind-up dates one
year apart, so that a lump of capital arrives at the beginning of each
school year.
Split-capital shares are generally only for those who are very sure of what
they are doing, or who have taken expert advice. This is illustrated by
horror stories of misguided people reinvesting dividends in high-yielding
income shares with a minimal redemption value - they are a shrinking asset,
so reinvesting dividends is like throwing money into a black hole. If you
are in any doubt, consult an independent financial adviser or stockbroker.
Any type of split-capital share can be held in a Pep, so that income and
capital growth are free of tax. For many people, it is only worth putting
income-generating shares into a Pep, as only a minority use up their Pounds
5,800 annual capital gains allowance, whereas most people pay income tax.
You could probably hold quite a large number of zero-dividend preference
shares or capital shares for several years without paying any tax on the
proceeds.
However, the longer you hold such shares, the greater the gains should be,
and so the more worthwhile a Pep becomes. If, for example, you are using a
Pep as part of your long-term retirement planning, zeros or capital shares
could be useful.
There are few packaged split-capital Peps on the market, and tying yourself
to one investment management group's Pep will limit your choice of shares. A
more usual approach is to take out a self-select Pep, and pick the holdings
yourself, or get your adviser or stockbroker to do the work.
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, recommends the Killik
self-select Pep as a shelter for split-capital shares, because of its low
cost - it has no initial or annual charges, just a 1.65 per cent dealing
charge, minimum Pounds 40, and a Pounds 7.50 fee for each dividend
collected.
The choice of shares depends on the state of the market when you buy. 'There
is a limited number of income shares that will not show a substantial loss
by redemption,' Boyton says. Of those few, he recommends at the moment River
Plate and Scottish National, which are yielding 10.2 per cent and 9 per cent
respectively. They both have a modest negative 'hurdle rate' to redemption.
The hurdle rate is the rate at which the fund's assets need to grow for the
shares to be repaid at the promised level. A negative hurdle rate means that
the fund can shrink from its present level and still meet the repayment.
Whitechurch Securities, the Bristol-based financial adviser, is offering an
Aggressive Growth Pep, which invests in capital shares. Capital shares are
highly geared, doing extremely well when the market is on the up, but
feeling the bad times more severely than other types of share when the
market falls. If the market crashes the week before they mature, all the
gains built up could be wiped out.
Whitechurch is aiming to minimise the risk by selling shares before the
wind-up date, and reinvesting the proceeds in other shares with a more
distant wind-up date. Kean Seager, managing director of Whitechurch, says
the Pep is intended as a long-term investment, and is not for the
faint-hearted.
Charges on the Whitechurch Pep are rather high, at 6 per cent initially,
2.25 per cent annually, and Pounds 10 for dealing. Seager says this is
because each Pep is managed individually, and investment strategy can be
altered to suit individual investors if their needs change.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Small, but thinking big -
Chamberlain De Broe, fifth in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, James Higgins launched Chamberlain De Broe with a handful of
colleagues plus 'a top-up mortgage and a couple of gold cards.' Today, he is
laying plans for a mini-flotation in the summer. Little wonder that he
claims the insurance industry exaggerates consumers' resistance to fee-based
advice.
He says: 'We will be selling off part of the company to raise finance to
duplicate this London office in a number of towns. Basically, we are saying
that Chamberlain De Broe has come from nowhere to a turnover of Pounds 1m in
four years and it is now going somewhere else. I don't want to stay a small
player. I think the country can support Chamberlain De Broe offices in every
major city.'
A business studies graduate, Higgins worked in the financial services
industry for 10 years before founding Chamberlain De Broe in 1990. During
that period, he became increasingly uncomfortable with the prevailing
sales-driven environment. He says: 'I wanted to advise on savings which paid
no commission whatsoever: to have the pleasure of being able to say to
people 'Keep your money in the building society and we will tell you when to
jump.' If someone comes in with a lot of money, we want them to retain us -
but we don't want to sell them anything on the first day.
'People know there is no vested interest in what we say. I don't like what
commission hunger does to people. I remain convinced that the structure of
the industry has worked against the consumer and the adviser having a sound
relationship.'
The fledgling firm, with its made-up name, had some good fortune soon after
launching when it produced a booklet on inheritance tax planning. Such
publications may be common - but this one was mentioned on a Channel 4
television programme. Before Chamberlain De Broe's tiny staff could catch
its breath, 12,000 people had asked for a copy.
Higgins says: 'We didn't even have computers and it cost us a fortune, but
that's where it really started because we had put a bit in the booklet on
the fees versus commission question. We survived because there was a high
level of demand. We received a lot of positive editorial because we were
telling a different story and that was newsworthy. To be blunt, the reason
people call, and follow through, is because there is not a lot of opposition
out there.'
Like many fee-based advisers, Chamberlain De Broe does not bill clients for
an initial meeting. 'It gives us a chance to see if we can do anything for
them,' Higgins explains. 'At the moment, I try to see all new prospective
clients. We put a lot of effort into understanding the client in the first
place. We concentrate like crazy.'
While Chamberlain De Broe does not require any minimum initial investment
from a client, it does not pretend it can help the Pounds 20-a-month saver
or the investor of modest means. Higgins suggests that the average
Chamberlain De Broe retainer client 'will probably need to be someone with
capital of around Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 200,000 before we can add value.'
Once a client is signed up, the firm aims to be his financial general
factotum. Five staff deal with private clients and two more handle the still
small corporate client business.
Chamberlain De Broe's execution-only services, which tend to centre on unit
trusts, new launches and new issues, are charged on a fixed-rate basis.
'These people don't need attention, by and large,' says Higgins. 'They know
what's what out there and they want to deal.'
Fees for the firm's all-embracing retainer service - which provides regular
reviews of all a client's affairs and personal contact once a year - are
more fluid and reflect the compexity of his needs. They could be as low as
Pounds 450 but the average is Pounds 1,800. Higgins says: 'We try to
time-base the fees as much as we can. We look at someone and see how much
time they will take, over the year. If someone comes in with Pounds 2.5m,
for instance, you know they will take up more of your time.'
Although Chamberlain De Broe does a considerable amount of investment work,
this is not the major feature of its personalised financial planning
service. 'We do the asset allocation but we farm out the investment
management,' says Higgins. 'My idea is to be the focal point of the client's
affairs.' No client money is handled by the firm.'
Higgins favours a pyramid structure for clients' investment portfolios. 'The
base has loads of cash, particularly at the moment. The little bit on the
top is the risk money.'
He cites Genesis Chile as one of his successes. 'It did incredibly well for
us but, in the same market, we went into a Latin American warrant fund where
I panicked totally. I went in, made 5 per cent overnight and bailed out. It
then shot up.'
The Chamberlain De Broe London office is on the corner of Haymarket, near
Piccadilly Circus, and the firm will open another branch in the West Country
later this year. Higgins anticipates a trouble-free launch. He says: 'I have
gone through the learning curve. Today, I won't waste so much effort on the
execution business. It is attractive for cash flow but there is not much
profit and there was a time when far too much of our resources were going to
these clients.'
Higgins adds: 'What we are trying to do is bring the personal service back.
The financial services industry doesn't offer that. It offers a sales
service.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Investment Trusts (5):
Keep an eye on the assets - Trust companies have been tackling the problem
of discounts in a number of ways, writes Bethan Hutton, including monthly
savings schemes to provide a steady demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Investment trusts have been around for more than a century, but the past few
years have seen a spectacular revival in their fortunes. At least part of
this has to be due to the popularity of investment trust Peps, particularly
since the tax-break was widened to allow the full Pounds 6,000 to be
invested in collective funds.
Like unit trusts, investment trusts offer investors, even those with very
modest savings, exposure to a wide spread of shares, thus reducing the risk.
There are fewer investment trusts than unit trusts, but they offer a huge
variety, from general UK and international funds to specialist funds
investing in a single country or using a particular strategy.
Many of the longest-established investment trusts, such as Foreign &amp;
Colonial's flagship fund, are general international funds which have been
reluctant to become fully qualifying for Pep investment, as this would mean
guaranteeing that at least 50 per cent of their holdings would be in the UK
or the rest of the European Union. However, many of the same investment
management groups have set up newer trusts which are fully Pep-qualifying,
using the same investment expertise, but focused on a narrower area.
Of course, you can still invest up to Pounds 1,500 a year in non-qualifying
funds, and the investment trust sector offers a wide choice of these.
Investment trusts have fewer investment restrictions than unit trusts; so,
for example, emerging market investment trusts can be more genuinely
adventurous than their unit trust counterparts, which can only put 10 per
cent of the fund into 'unapproved' stock markets. Investment trusts can also
offer some innovative structures, such as split-capital trusts (see facing
page).
One important difference between unit and investment trusts is that the
price of shares in investment trusts fluctuates according to market demand,
unlike the price of units in unit trusts, which is set by the trust's
manager, and relates directly to the value of the underlying assets. This
can mean that if shares in an investment trust are in demand, you pay a
higher share price than its underlying assets are worth. When this happens,
the share is said to be trading at a premium. More usually, investment trust
shares trade at a discount - the value of the assets per share is higher
than the price of the share. At the moment, discounts are at historically
narrow levels.
If you buy shares at a premium or a narrow discount, you run the risk that,
even if the trust's portfolio performs well, if the trust itself ceases to
be so popular, the share price could slip back to a wider discount by the
time you want to sell. A considerable part of investment trusts'
outperformance of unit trusts over the past few years can be attributed to
the narrowing of discounts, but a widening would lead to underperformance.
Investment trust companies have been tackling the problem of discounts in a
number of ways, including setting up monthly savings schemes to provide a
steady demand.
Savings schemes are popular with many small investors who are worried by the
ups and downs of the stockmarket. By investing a fixed amount - say Pounds
50 - every month, you buy more shares when the price is low, and fewer when
the price is high. This lowers the average cost of the shares you buy, and
reduces the likelihood of your putting in a lump sum at the top of the
market and seeing your investment take a dive the next week. You can also
contribute to a Pep through a savings scheme.
Many, but not all, investment trust management groups run their own Peps.
The alternative is to take out a self-select Pep with an independent
manager, and use it to buy investment trust shares. The choice between these
two approaches depends on the charges, but also how wide a choice of funds
you want to be able to include in your Pep.
Some investment trust groups only include two or three trusts in their Peps,
whereas others give you free choice of all their funds, and sometimes those
of other groups as well. This gives you greater flexibility if you want to
switch between funds - for example, if the performance of your first choice
is not what you expected. Of course, with a self-select Pep you can include
whatever trusts you like, within the legal limits.
The first two months of this year have seen a rash of new investment trust
launches. Many of them are not fully Pep-qualifying, as they invest in such
areas as Latin America, Israel and Taiwan, but a number are aimed squarely
at the Pep market.
Buying investment trust shares during the launch period has its attractions,
particularly when other trusts in the same sector are trading at large
premiums. Buyers of new issues pay only the net asset value, plus the issue
expenses, which rarely exceed 4 per cent.
New trusts often aim to compensate for the dent made by issue expenses by
attaching warrants to the new shares. Warrants give investors the right to
purchase shares in the future at a fixed price. They can be traded
separately, and acquire a value because investors expect the market price of
the shares to rise above the warrants' exercise price by the time they can
be used. Warrants attached to newly-issued shares can sometimes be
transferred into a Pep along with the shares.
Many new investment trust issues offer very attractive terms for investors
who opt for a Pep attached to the trust. However, if you commit your Pep
allowance for this year to a Pep tied to a new issue, you run the risk that
the offer will be over-subscribed, so that applications have to be scaled
down, and you may not be allocated enough shares use up your Pep allowance.
Rather than Pounds 6,000-worth of shares, you could end up with only Pounds
2,000 or so. To take full advantage of your Pep allowance, you would then
have to buy more shares on the open market, probably at a higher price.
Some trusts promise not to scale back small applications, or hold a ballot,
so that Pep applicants are allocated either their full amount or nothing at
all, leaving them free to take out a Pep elsewhere. If you fear a trust
might be over-subscribed, it is worth inquiring what the attitude towards
Pep investors is likely to be.
A potential drawback for keen investors is that buying investment trust
shares via a Pep makes it more difficult to participate in shareholders
meetings. Most Pep managers make an extra charge - commonly Pounds 10-Pounds
25, but it can be as much as Pounds 50 - if you want to attend an AGM. A few
managers, such as Flemings, make a point of not charging for this service.
If shareholder participation is important to you, check this point before
you sign up.

monitor statistics

Unit trusts have had good reason to be grateful to personal equity plans.
Last year, a record Pounds 9.1bn was poured into the industry, with private
investors accounting for Pounds 5bn of this net investment (gross investment
less redemptions). They chose to channel nearly two-thirds of their money
through a personal equity plan, attesting to the sustained popularity of
Peps as a way of investing in equity markets.
Both unit and investment trusts benefited from the decision by former
chancellor Norman Lamont to lift the Pounds 3,000 limit on collective-fund
Pep investment from the 1992 tax year.
Some restrictions still remain. A unit trust must have more than 50 per cent
of the fund invested in Europe to qualify for the full general Pep allowance
of Pounds 6,000. The many unit trusts that do not meet this requirement are
'non-qualifying', and only Pounds 1,500 of the fund can be invested in the
Pep. The remaining Pounds 4,500 of the allowance can be made up with
qualifying trusts, investment trusts or shares.
An investor contemplating a Pep will find that unit trusts have the
advantage over investment trusts, at least in terms of charges, because many
unit trust managers will put the investment into a Pep for no extra cost.
This means that anyone who wants to make a unit trust investment may as well
shelter some of it in a Pep (see article on charges, on page 4).
If your chosen trust does not have a Pep attached to it, you will have to
use a self-select Pep, but there will be additional charges, since most plan
managers will levy an annual fee and are likely to charge for the collection
of dividends.
Moreover, some unit trust companies offer lower initial charges for direct
investment, but the same reduction may not be on offer to private investors
buying through the self-select route. On the other hand, some stockbrokers
are able to obtain discounts on the initial charge of a large number of unit
trusts.
Once you have run through the arguments and decided to invest in a unit,
rather than investment, trust, the main criteria for choosing the Pep will
be the performance of the unit trust company. The most important
characteristic to look out for is consistency of performance. The FT's
sister publication, Money Management magazine, carries performance
statistics every month, and the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance also
publishes tables ranking the growth of the leading unit trusts over five
years.
These publications divide unit trusts into a large number of different
sectors, categorised mainly by regions but also by income and growth.
Chase de Vere Investments produces performance charts ranking only those
unit trusts with a Pep attached to them. It divides these into those that
are qualifying and non-qualifying. The performance charts are published
every six months, and the most recent copy is available with Chase de Vere's
annual Pep Guide*, which gives details of managers and their charging
structures.
Meanwhile, the tables on this page show the top-performing qualifying and
non-qualifying unit trusts in the three years to January 1. It should be
noted that these are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis, which means that the
initial charges have not been taken into account - the actual returns to
investors will have been lower. The figures also assume reinvestment of
gross income.
The top 10 qualifying trusts are spread across a number of different
sectors, including the specialist smaller companies and those which are
income-oriented. The top-performing non-qualifying trusts are more narrowly
focused, and reflect the impressive growth over the past three years of
emerging markets, particularly in the Far East.
Apart from performance and charges, investors should choose according to
their investment needs. An investor in his late twenties may be happy to use
up part of his Pep allowance in emerging markets, but this may not appeal to
someone in the prime of life who hopes that the Pep will supplement their
pension.
unit trust companies try to make the choice easier by packaging their
products to appeal to specific groups of people, although this does not mean
it is not worth the precaution of taking independent financial advice.
Fidelity, for example, recently launched two new Peps, one for first-time
investors and the other for those specifically saving for retirement. The
Moneybuilder Pep is attached to the company's existing fund of funds unit
trust. Technical changes have been made to the trust, to ensure that it
remains fully-qualifying. Mary Blair, director of product development, says
the product is particularly good for first-time investors, because it acts
like a managed fund and gives exposure to global as well as UK and European
markets.
As a special offer, the 2 per cent initial charge on the Pep is halved until
March 11.
The UK Dividend Growth fund is a new Fidelity unit trust, investing in UK
companies with the ability to grow dividends of between 8-10 per cent a
year. Since the dividends will be reinvested, the idea is that this will
help produce a large lump sum which can be taken tax-free on retirement, or
after 10-15 years. The initial charge on the Retirement Income Builder (the
name of the Pep attached to the fund) is 2 per cent and, in line with all
Fidelity Peps, exit charges also apply. Minimum investment in both new Peps
is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 regular monthly savings.
Some unit trust companies will allow you to split your Pep between its
funds, but it is harder to find any that will let another company's funds be
included. A step was made in this direction earlier this year, when Skandia
Life launched a type of umbrella Pep fund, allowing investors to split their
Pep allowance between different unit trust management groups or to switch
out of one company's fund and into another's, without having to pay a
transfer fee or the full initial charge on the new unit trust. Instead, the
initial charge is between 0.25-0.5 per cent.
The choice is not limitless, but it includes some of the best names. The
Multipep offers 30 funds from 12 providers - Fidelity, Gartmore, James
Capel, Morgan Grenfell, Baring, Schroder, Perpetual, Framlington, Henderson,
Abtrust, Credit Suisse and Jupiter Tyndall Merlin.
Because of the low switching charges, Skandia says that an investor putting
Pounds 6,000 a year into a Pep, and deciding after three years to transfer
to another provider, would usually pay about Pounds 900 for doing so
(assuming a 5 per cent initial charge on a total investment of Pounds
18,000). The cost within the Multipep would be Pounds 63, according to
Skandia.
However, there is a price to pay for this flexibility. The initial charge on
the Multipep is 4.5-5 per cent, which is lower than the standard unit trust
initial charge; but Skandia imposes its own annual fee of 0.5 per cent on
top of the fee charged by the manager, so that the total annual fee will
vary between 1.5 and 2 per cent.
Over time, annual fees have much more of an effect on performance than
initial charges. Moreover there is a dividend-collection charge of Pounds 5
for one payment a year down to Pounds 2 a dividend for 12 payments.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Watching and waiting - Alison Smith
assesses the new Personal Investment Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From July a new watchdog, the Personal Investment Authority, is due to open
for business. The PIA's brief is to improve sharply the standards for
independent financial advisers, life companies, banks and building societies
selling financial services to private investors. It will replace the
existing regulatory bodies for these services such as Fimbra and Lautro.
There is some scepticism in the industry and among consumer groups about
whether investor protection standards will rise significantly once the PIA
starts. And there is bound to be a long period while the jury of public
opinion considers if any overall improvement has been made. In the meantime,
the PIA does have a valuable - if unheroic - fallback position because of
the general welcome for its plans to deal with consumer complaints.
The proposals for handling complaints are among the more detailed and
definite aspects of the PIA prospectus, published on Monday. Indeed, the
most likely problem with the systems it sets up may well be a degree of
over-kill for even the most aggrieved investor.
In the first instance, these systems cover the internal procedures for
handling complaints of every firm regulated by the PIA. The firms must
acknowledge complaints within seven days and give the customer a copy of an
official leaflet setting out how these are dealt with. If the issue is not
resolved in two months, the customer must be told he can refer the matter to
the PIA ombudsman.
The second stage is the ombudsman scheme itself. The ombudsman will try to
conciliate but, if that proves impossible, will make a judgment. Whatever
the strict legal position, he will be able to give precedence to the PIA's
own principles, rules and codes.
If the customer is content with the ombudsman's award (up to a maximum of
Pounds 50,000), then the firm will have to pay. Above that limit - which is
half that for the insurance ombudsman at present - the PIA ombudsman can
recommend a high award if he thinks the case warrants it.
Firms will have to join the scheme, but they will also be able to volunteer
to give the ombudsman an extra role. This would cover complaints relating to
life policies - an issue that goes wider than simply regulating the way a
firm does business. In this role, the ombudsman could deal with a complaint
about how a life office had handled a maturity claim - an area which might
well not affect the way in which the PIA regulated one of its members.
As is usual with ombudsman schemes, that of the PIA will be supervised by a
council - chaired in this case by Baroness Turner of Camden, a Labour
front-bench spokesman in the House of Lords. In addition, the PIA will
appoint a complaints commissioner whose task will be to keep under review,
and report annually on, how the way PIA handles complaints against the firms
it regulates - and against itself.
Aggrieved investors were on the minds of another regulator this week as the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, published its
proposals for overhauling the investors' compensation scheme (ICS). This
acts as a safety net for investors who have lost out from bad advice and
find that those responsible are not around to provide compensation.
SIB's paper says that compensating people who have lost out after following
poor advice to transfer from an occupational pension scheme will be dealt
with outside the normal ICS arrangements.
Some estimates for compensation over these transfers have reached Pounds
1bn, but even those who refuse to believe they will be that high concede
they are likely to top Pounds 100m - although at least some of that will be
covered by the firms which wrote the business and have made provisions
against possible liabilities.
A permanent agreement about how to handle pension transfer claims where
firms are unable to meet their liabilities is unlikely to come into effect
until the autumn.
In other respects, however, this week's proposals will not affect the way in
which the ICS operates as far as investors are concerned. SIB has decided
against the suggestion that separate schemes for different parts of the
financial services sector might be set up.
Nor will there be a change to the limits on compensation paid for any one
claim: a maximum of Pounds 48,000, made up of 100 per cent of the first
Pounds 30,000 and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
January. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month
in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale;
the balance will be your taxable gain or loss. Suppose you bought shares for
Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them in January 1994 for Pounds
13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the September 1985 figure of 1.481
gives a total of Pounds 8,886. Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a
capital gain of Pounds 4,114, which is within the 1993-94 CGT allowance of
Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use
the March 1982 figure. The RPI in January was 141.3. It has not been
possible to use indexation to create, or to increase, a loss for shares sold
since November 30 1993.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Self-Select PEPs (3):
Big companies offer shelter - A crucial development, writes Robert Miller,
has been the arrival of corporate Peps promoted by big British groups,
allowing savers to include other shares in their plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of being swamped by the marketing muscle of the more generalist
unit and investment trust personal equity plans, self-select Peps are
finally coming into their own.
But, despite the increased popularity of the do-it-yourself approach to
Peps, there is still an enormous disparity between the charges levied by
different plan managers and the levels of service offered.
The first step on the self-select route is to decide whether the Pep is to
be a Pounds 6,000 general plan, or a Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep. The
next, picking a suitable plan manager, is more difficult. By and large,
self-select Pep managers offer two levels of service based on the
execution-only of buy and sell orders for shares; or they give advice as
well.
Investors may start out with a clear idea of which shares, or in some cases
unit and investment trusts, they want to hold in their self-select
portfolio, but stock market and personal circumstances change, and advice
might be welcomed at some future stage.
Some self-select Pep plan managers simply offer the service to existing
clients as an add-on to more general portfolio management, but an increasing
number of stockbroking firms and financial advisers have made a point of
promoting low-cost self-select plans.
These include Killik &amp; Co, Pilling, Reyker Securities, Pointon &amp; York,
Waters Lunniss (the stockbroking arm of Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building
Society), John Siddell &amp; Son and Barclays Stockbrokers.
On the charges front, Justin Urquhart Stewart, a director of Barclays
Stockbrokers, says: 'For a single-company self-select plan, annual charges
of 0.5 per cent are reasonable. For example, if the share concerned has a
yield of between 4.5 and 5 per cent, there are still tangible benefits on
the tax break. The annual charges for a Pounds 6,000 self-select plan should
average 1 per cent.
'But there is a catch on some self-select plans. Certain managers will
charge for each dividend they collect. Since most of the larger companies
pay dividends twice a year and a general Pep might have three of four
holdings, the costs can eat up profits pretty quickly. The more competitive
plan managers make a one-off charge for all annual administration, including
the collection of dividends, and that is in the 1 per cent.'
By far the biggest development in favour of private investors in the
self-select Pep market has been the arrival on the scene of corporate Peps
promoted by big British companies.
Urquhart Stewart explains: 'Companies such as British Airways, BAA, Redland
and BET started out by offering low-cost entry Peps in their own shares. But
they realised that private investors might begin to resent the lack of
choice if that company's share price took a nosedive. So they changed the
rules to make the Peps more flexible.
'British Airways, for instance, only insists that investors hold a minimum
of 200 of its shares. They can then choose to shelter other shares within
the BA umbrella. Some plans also allow money to be put into unit or
investment trusts.'
On average, the costs of a Pounds 6,000 corporate self-select personal
equity plan should be 0.5 per cent a year. Commission charges for buying and
selling shares within the plan are generally 1 per cent, with a minimum of
Pounds 10, for postal dealing and 1.5 per cent with a minimum of Pounds 20
for telephone dealing. These charges are broadly the same as non-corporate
self-select plans.
Investors with an existing portfolio of shares who decide to transfer them
into a self-select Pep should be aware of the potential costs involved, says
Matthew Orr, a partner in Killik &amp; Co.
He warns: 'In order to satisfy the Inland Revenue rules on Peps, the shares
will have to be sold and bought back on the open market before they are
sheltered within the plan.
'For that service, we charge 1.65 per cent to sell and a Pounds 40 fixed fee
for the shares in each separate company to buy back. There is also the 0.5
per cent stamp duty to pay on the purchase.'
But once you have paid the initial charges, the long-term advantages of
do-it-yourself Peps become more apparent, says Orr. 'More and more people
are transferring Peps bought in previous years - which might have come from
two or three different firms - under one umbrella. This can help keep costs
down and gives better control over the portfolio. For example, a lot people
sitting on reasonable past profits are switching their portfolios around to
take advantage of the Pounds 1,500 rule. This allows sums up to that amount
to be invested in non-Pep qualifying stock markets, such as those of the
Pacific Rim or even the US.'
The final pitfall to watch out for is the holding of cash within a
self-select Pep. The Inland Revenue does allow cash to be sheltered and to
earn interest from deposits, but only if the money is genuinely meant for
putting back into the stock market. If the cash is held for too long, the
Revenue could well void the plan.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A man for all reasons - Barbara
Ellis on the insurance ombudsman's annual report
</HEADLINE>

Compensation claims from home income plan investors have been pitched into
further doubt in what has become a three-year tussle between the insurance
and building societies ombudsmen and the institutions under their
jurisdiction.
Home income plans are packaged investments consisting of a mortgage taken
out to buy an insurance company investment bond. Thousands were sold during
the late 1980s on the basis that income from the bond would pay the mortgage
interest and provide an income. But many salesmen failed to warn about the
risks of spiralling debt and repossession if house prices and investment
returns fell, and interest rates rose.
Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, says home income plans are the most
significant part of his work load, totalling about 1,000 cases now with one
or two new complaints arriving daily. So far, he has closed about 80 cases,
with payouts to investors averaging Pounds 55,000, and distress payments
averaging Pounds 1,500. But Farrand now faces a challenge from Sun Life.
Last year, a QC acting as arbitrator in a case involving Legal and General
ruled that the insurance ombudsman could not deal with a complaint about the
mortgage element of an endowment mortgage package. Farrand felt this put
home income plans outside his jurisdiction but John Craddock, a retired L&amp;G
executive who chairs the ombudsman scheme board, said he should continue
handling them.
Farrand now is considering a handful of cases involving Sun Life although
the company says it does not think they fall into the category of home
income plans. Geoffrey Holt, compliance executive at the company, says two
of the investors took out roll-up mortgages from building societies, then
approached a Sun Life salesman to invest part of the money raised in a bond.
'We will look at the advice on the bond, but it is up to the societies to
deal with the mortgage,' says Holt.
Ombudsmen covering the building societies have no jurisdiction over
'pre-completion' matters such as advice given before a person takes up a
mortgage as part of a home income plan. They are handling some home income
plan complaints, but only with the voluntary consent of the societies
concerned. Some have refused flatly to co-operate.
Although a Building Societies' Association report has recommended the
ombudsman's jurisdiction be extended to pre-completion complaints, it was
careful to exempt complaints about the selling of investments, saying these
would be 'more appropriate' to the new PIA ombudsman (see page VI) due to
start work in July. But this could entail disastrous delay for investors, as
most were elderly when they bought the plans.
Moreover, if the PIA also takes over Farrand's long-term insurance case
load, home income cases presumably will be included, resulting in a probable
halving of the maximum Pounds 100,000 compensation available from the
insurance ombudsman now.

Hutton on the insurance ombudsman's annual report

Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, does not have an easy job. On his
desk - and those of his many assistants - land the cases of the most
tenacious complainants and the most intransigent insurance companies. More
and more arrive every year.
The task for Farrand and his staff is to look at the cases objectively and
try to work out a common-sense solution which is fair to everyone involved.
On average, one-third of cases result in at least partial success for the
complainant.
This impartial approach means he is plagued by both sides. In his annual
report, published this week, Farrand makes a heartfelt plea for people not
to be abusive over the telephone or write every week repeating the same
arguments. But he also asks insurance companies not to react negatively when
facing an investigation.
Of the 63,000 calls and letters received by the bureau last year, almost 90
per cent concerned matters outside its scope. It can take on only cases
involving companies that belong to the scheme - and then only when the
customer has exhausted a company's own complaints procedure.
Farrand's jurisdiction covers the whole range of insurance, from a one-week
travel policy to long-term life cover. The highest award made last year was
Pounds 230,000 and the smallest Pounds 3.88. Occasionally, claimants are
seeking merely a moral victory or, perhaps, an apology.
Some cases handled by the bureau are disturbing. One involved a joint life
insurance policy, taken out by a married couple, where the husband murdered
his wife in front of their three children before killing himself. A
compromise was reached, under which half the policy's value was paid to the
wife's estate.
Some are comic, such as a policyholder's claim that the devastation caused
by two young puppies with very sharp teeth left alone at home came under the
definition of 'animals colliding with the house.' His case was rejected.
The bulk of the bureau's time, however, is taken up with much more mundane
matters of home income plans, administrative incompetence, policy churning,
subsidence claims and so on.
Once a case has been given to a worker, the average resolution time is 3 1/2
months. But patience is necessary: the longest-running case - a complicated
matter of subsidence - has taken about seven years.
Life assurance continues to draw more complaints than any other single
category. But 39 per cent of these are resolved in the customer's favour
compared with 29 per cent for general insurance cases.
The most common complaints about life assurance are poor communication,
administrative failure, bad service, and mis-selling.
The level of fraud and excessive claims is worrying the insurance industry.
Fraud is said to cost honest policyholders Pounds 1m a day, while there is
widespread acceptance of the attitude: 'It doesn't matter, I'm insured.' But
measures taken to clamp down on this can penalise honest, responsible
claimants.
Insurers are tending to apply more strictly the 'reasonable care' provisions
of many policies. Complaints frequently involve travel insurance, and
belongings left on beaches.
In one case, where Pounds 4,000-worth of jewellery had been left unattended
in a bag for 10 minutes, the ombudsman decided reasonable care had not been
taken.
But in another, where the policyholder had taken his bag to the beach
because his room was not ready, and was robbed after falling asleep, the
complaint was upheld.
Sometimes, it can be difficult to determine the issue of good faith. The
report tells of a man who took out several personal accident insurance
policies to the value of Pounds 500,000 - then chopped off a finger and part
of his thumb with a meat cleaver while making a chicken curry.
Just one of his claims was rejected, for essentially technical reasons, but
the others were met. The issue of intent was not raised, however, and
Farrand wonders if the man was extremely clever, or merely careless, with
his cleaver.
Issues arising from a particular case sometimes lead the ombudsman to make
general recommendations.
This year, Farrand urges life companies who know they are going to cut bonus
rates to warn customers asking for a quote before the cuts are announced or
implemented.
In the past, however, companies' response to general recommendations often
has been to tighten the wording of their policies, usually to the detriment
of the customer. This is what happened with claims for matching items, such
as furniture covers, when part of a set has been damaged.
The ombudsman's general view was that half the non-damaged items should be
paid for. But many insurers responded by excluding matching items
altogether.

Flat owners thinking of using new legislation to extend their leases, or
club together to buy their freehold, can now get free advice. The Leasehold
Enfranchisement Advisory Service has been set up jointly by the Department
of the Environment and a number of private sector organisations.
The service will advise leaseholders and freeholders directly as well as
publishing information leaflets and lists of professionals able to help with
the enfranchisement process.
Since November 1 1993, leaseholders have had the right to extend their
leases or buy the freehold if they meet certain conditions, but the
regulations are very complicated and the process takes several months to
complete.
LEAS can be contacted at 6/8 Maddox Street, London W1R 9PN (tel. 071-493
3116).

Abbey Life has joined Hypo F&amp;C and Morgan Grenfell in launching a
high-income unit trust Pep which uses derivatives to provide the higher
income.
The Extra Income Pep is based on a new fund and aims to preserve capital
over the long term, while providing a monthly income fixed at 2 percentage
points above base rates.
Maximum payout is 13 per cent, so investors will not benefit from base rates
rising above 11 per cent.
About 55 per cent of the underlying fund will be invested in UK blue chip
shares and another 40 per cent will be in derivatives, mainly futures and
options. The balance will be held in cash.
This is potentially a less risky fund in terms of preserving capital than
the others, which pay 10 per cent, since the income stream is linked to base
rates. Investors should check to see that they are happy with the
performance of Abbey funds.
Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. Initial charge is 6 per cent and annual
management fee is 1.5 per cent. There is a 1 percentage point bonus until
April 29.
* * *
Pilling &amp; Co., a Manchester-based stockbroker, has cut the minimum dealing
charge on its self-select personal equity plans to Pounds 10 from Pounds 30.
The dealing commission rate is 1.65 per cent.
There is no charge for setting up a plan and no annual fee, but there is a
Pounds 6.75 fee for each dividend on which tax has to be reclaimed.
Investors can hold any qualifying stock in the Pep and get free advice from
Pilling's dealers.
* * *
Norwich Union is offering a 3 percentage point discount on lump sum
investments of Pounds 3,000 or more into its Pep unit trusts, bringing the
bid-offer spread down to 3 per cent until March 29.
Pep investors can choose between four unit trusts instead of two. These are
Norwich Union's UK Equity Growth, UK Equity Income, UK Smaller Companies and
European trusts. Annual charge is 1.5 per cent.
* * *
Yorkshire building society has launched its own telephone share dealing
service through its subsidiary, YorkSHARE. Until the end of July, the
minimum commission on telephone deals will be Pounds 9. Commission on deals
up to Pounds 4,800 is 0.75 per cent, while deals over Pounds 4,800 will cost
Pounds 36 plus 0.1 per cent on excess over Pounds 4,800.
From July 31, the charges will be 1 per cent (minimum Pounds 14), and Pounds
48 (plus 0.1 per cent) on deals over Pounds 4,800. There is a one-off
membership fee of Pounds 5.

When HSBC Holdings announces its results on Monday, there will be strong
interest in the dividend level. The poor reception of National Westminster
bank's results last week was attributed partly to the fact that NatWest
raised its dividend only 6 per cent compared with a 20 per cent rise at
Lloyds bank. Analysts are expecting a rise of a third in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 2.3bn, against Pounds 1.71bn. Midland is expected to more than double
last year's Pounds 315m profit. Without the exposure to past bad debts from
corporate lending, Abbey National is likely on Tuesday to show a steadier
increase in pre-tax profits for 1993 than the UK's other banks - to about
Pounds 700m (Pounds 564m). Most attention will focus on the dividend
increase, which some analysts are expecting to be generous because of
Abbey's strong capital ratios.
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, is expected to report a
20 per cent decline in profits for 1993 on Wednesday. The group hinted at
the Pounds 97m (Pounds 121.8m) pre-tax figure three weeks ago when it
launched its contested Pounds 497m bid for Westland, the UK's only
helicopter manufacturer.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, has blamed the decline on redundancy and
restructuring costs of some Pounds 20m and an exceptional Pounds 11m charge
covering closure costs at UES, the group's associated steel company.
The sharp upturn in the new car market should help both T. Cowie and Henlys
Group, two motor distributors which report their full-year results this
week. Cowie, which also operates a sizeable vehicle leasing business, is
expected on Wednesday to post pre-tax profits of about Pounds 33m (Pounds
24.3m). Full-year pre-tax profits for Henlys (due on Friday) of about Pounds
6.3m are expected, against a Pounds 848,000 loss.
Zeneca's full-year results on Thursday, the first since the demerger last
summer from ICI, have already been foreshadowed by a trading statement in
January. The company should see pre-tax profits at close to Pounds 650m
compared with a pro forma Pounds 442m last year. Its attractiveness to
yield-minded investors should be consolidated with a dividend of 27.5p
giving the shares a yield of 4.6 per cent.
Associated British Ports, also reporting on Thursday, is expected to rebound
from last year's Pounds 36.6m pre-tax loss - recorded after Pounds 83.6m of
property provisions - to show a full-year profit of at least Pounds 60m.
Results on Friday from Cookson Group, the specialist industrial materials
company, should provide solid evidence of the state of recovery in both the
UK and the US. Excluding a Pounds 5.5m exceptional gain on disposals
announced at the interim stage, full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds
90m and Pounds 95m are expected, against 1992's Pounds 72.5m total.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: OFT targets funerals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading this week launched an inquiry into the pre-paid
funeral industry. Only relatively few British people have chosen to organise
their own funerals while still alive although the idea is big business in
the United States and has begun to catch on in the UK.
But the collapse of one UK firm, Will Writing Services, the business of
which included selling pre-paid funerals, has drawn attention to the fact
that the sector is not subject to any regulation.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the OFT's director-general who announced the inquiry,
said: 'The financial implications of the growth of pre-paid funerals are
considerable.'
If only a quarter of the 20m people in the UK over 50 bought pre-paid
funerals at an average of Pounds 1,000, the money involved would add up to
Pounds 5bn.
Carsberg added that the funds would not be regulated or safeguarded by any
legislation because they represented advance payments for services and did
not fall within the definition of savings, investments or insurance.
The OFT's main concern is to protect consumers' money by ensuring it is kept
separate from funeral companies' other funds and monitored by independent
trustees.
But officials also are worried that over-elaborate and expensive funerals
could be sold to vulnerable or elderly people who were unable, or too
confused, to resist the salesman's blandishments.
Four main companies offer pre-paid funeral plans in the UK: Chosen Heritage
(the largest), Dignity, Golden Charter, and the Co-operative Wholesale
Society. All are linked to existing large funeral businesses or networks of
funeral directors.
They offer a range of funeral plans, from basic to ostentatious, some of
which can be tailor-made.
Although the pre-paid funerals industry is still fairly small, it has two
rival trade organisations: the National Association of Pre-paid Funeral
Plans (leading members: Chosen Heritage and Dignity) and the Funeral
Planning Council (leading members: CWS Funeral Services and Golden Charter).
The NAPF this week launched a code of practice covering the monitoring of
investments, advertising guidelines, and procedures for handling complaints.
The FPC is still working on its version.
Age Concern, the charity, has links with the Chosen Heritage scheme. It has
published a check list of information customers should get before buying a
pre-paid funeral plan. This includes:
Does the money go into an independent trust fund, separate from the other
assets of the company?
Does the plan guarantee to cover the cost of a specified funeral service, no
matter how far in the future the need arises and how much costs have risen?
Does the plan cover the full cost of the funeral, or are there extra
services which will need to be paid for at the time of the funeral?
Is the plan portable (in case you move), or can your money be refunded?

Investors seeking to take advantage of the housing sector's long-awaited
recovery may want to study Graham Group, the builders' merchant which begins
trading on March 8 with a value of Pounds 209.8m, writes Peggy Hollinger.
This business has been starved of investment under its parent, BTR, and
there is ample opportunity to improve margins.
Graham, with its exposure to both the heavier timber and brick side of the
business, and the lighter plumbing and kitchen sector, also is well placed
to benefit from a pick-up in the housing market.
There remain, however, concerns about Graham once the initial benefits of
restructuring come through. The top team, while more than capable of
addressing the present problems, does not have wide experience of builders'
merchanting. Graham will also be up against far bigger rivals such as
Wolseley.
While well placed for recovery, questions remain also about the group's
ability to manage the inevitable downturn. The inescapable feature of
construction is its cyclical nature. Still, these are questions for two or
three years from now. The shares appear almost certain to trade at a premium
to the 183p offer price for the short term.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Charges (2): Take care
if you pay little tax - Many people have been happy to invest without
questioning whether they are getting value for money - but extra
admininstration must usually be paid for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The worth of a personal equity plan lies in being able to shelter capital
gains and income from tax. Attracted by the tax-free label, many people have
been happy to invest without questioning whether they are actually getting
value for money.
You can only invest in a Pep through a plan manager, who will levy charges
for the additional administration involved. The main charges are the initial
one and an annual management fee.
On a unit trust, these charges are typically 5-6 per cent initially and 1.5
per cent annually. Since the dividend yield on the FT-SE A All-Share is only
about 3.3 per cent at the moment, the income from the full Pounds 6,000
invested in a total return unit trust Pep would be Pounds 198 in the first
year. The tax saving to a higher rate taxpayer would be Pounds 79.20 and
Pounds 39.60 to someone in the lower-rate band.
Against this saving have to be set the Pounds 330 initial charge (assuming
this is 5.5 per cent) in addition to a Pounds 90 annual fee. It will
therefore take many years before the income tax saving outweighs the Pounds
420 charge (which excludes VAT), particularly for a lower-rate taxpayer.
James Higgins, of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'The point
of effecting a Pep is to save tax - if the charges are more than the tax
saved, then the vehicle is literally a waste of money and for most
basic-rate taxpayers, the average unit trust package is just that.'
Gains made within a Pep are also free of tax, but capital gains tax is one
which few people pay: the Inland Revenue estimates the number for 1993-94 at
only 125,000. This tax benefit will be greatest to those who invest their
whole Pep limit of Pounds 6,000 a tax year in a general Pep (and a further
Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep) and who hold on to it for as long as
possible. They are then likely to make enough capital gain to use up their
annual allowance, currently of Pounds 5,800.
Deciding to invest in a Pep on the basis of tax savings, therefore, can be a
mistake particularly if you are a lower-rate taxpayer. The situation is
different, however, if you had anyway decided to enter the stock market,
particularly if you intended to do so through a unit trust. This is because.
. .
UNIT TRUST CHARGES:
Most unit trusts do not levy an additional charge for their Pep, so you
might as well make use of the Pep facility if your chosen fund has one
attached to it.
Moreover, many unit trusts companies are competing keenly for Pep business,
leading them to bring in lower charges, a process which began in February
1992 when Murray Johnstone reduced the initial charge on all its unit trusts
to 1 per cent, and to 1.5 per cent for its Peps. Last October, the Pep
charge was brought in line with the unit trusts. However, Murray Johnstone
at the same time raised its annual management fee from 1 per cent to 1.5 per
cent.
Fidelity brought in an American-style innovation when it reduced the initial
charge on all its unit trust Peps to 2 per cent in 1992 but introduced
withdrawal charges instead. Gartmore, Guinness Flight, M&amp;G and Scottish
Equitable have also introduced a similar charging structure.
Since equities are a long-term investment, back-end charges are a better
idea than initial charges. Investors who hold on to the Pep for long enough,
escape the charge altogether. However, all those levying withdrawal charges,
with the exception of Gartmore, do so on the value of the fund, which means
that you would have to pay the charge on any growth your investment had
made. Gartmore levies the exit charge on the initial investment only.
Scottish Equitable is the only one of those listed to impose a flat fee of
Pounds 45 plus VAT, instead of an initial charge, and this fee is being
waived altogether until April 29.
Its annual management charge, however, is higher than those imposed by the
others listed. A good fund manager can compensate for the initial charge
through performance, but in the long run a high annual charge can be more
detrimental to an investor's returns. However, the company gives investors a
1 per cent loyalty bonus on the value held in their Pep on its eighth
anniversary.
There are, in addition, many unit trust companies offering one-off discounts
on their Peps in the run-up to the end of the tax year. Save &amp; Prosper, for
example, is knocking one percentage point off the unit price of its Peps
until April 5, while Prolific is reducing the initial charge from 5.25 per
cent to 3 per cent until June 1, in the hope of picking up Pep investments
across two tax years.
INVESTMENT TRUST CHARGES:
Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts tend to impose an additional charge
for Peps, because plans do cost money to administer, and normal trust fees
are low compared with unit trusts. As a result, lower-rate taxpayers need to
consider whether they might be better off investing in an investment trust
through a conventional savings scheme rather than the Pep.
Price-cutting has also been rife among investment trusts. Finsbury Asset
Management which used to charge 2 per cent initially and 0.5 per cent every
six months, waived these charges at the beginning of the year. There are no
dealing charges either, although there is a transfer charge of Pounds 30.
Anthony Townsend, director, said that the cost of operating the Pep scheme
could be absorbed by the trust; and, because of the increased demand for the
trust, the trust's value also increases.
The table shows a selection of investment trust Peps with lower charges.
Investors should be wary of trusts with low initial charges but high annual
or dealing charges.
The Alliance Trust, which has no initial or annual charges, is
non-qualifying, so only Pounds 1,500 of its shares can be put into the Pep.
However, it allows top-ups at no extra charge from a large number of other
investment trusts and UK equities.
Finally, investors should never base their Pep choice solely on the charges;
performance is far more important in the long run; but if two funds both
have good performance, the one with the lower charges will give the investor

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Are company cars a waste of money? -
With a new tax system for business drivers imminent, Scheherazade Daneshkhu
examines the impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should you keep your company car? The question arises because a new system
of taxing the UK's 1.8m company car drivers will come into force from next
month.
The old scale charges, based on three engine-size bands and two price
'thresholds,' will disappear. Under the simpler replacement system, tax will
be paid on a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's list price when new,
plus any extras and value added tax.
The new system - detailed by Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the
exchequer, in his March 1993 Budget - is aimed at ending distortions in the
new car market. The government has said that, on average, the amount raised
will be the same as under the old system, although some people will pay more
and others less.
Most pay-as-you-earn employees will not be able to tell from their tax code
if they are better or worse off because most are based on the old system.
The Inland Revenue says this is because list prices have not been submitted
by employers. Codes taking the new tax system into account will have the
word 'new' alongside the car benefit figure.
If the old system works to your advantage, it is unlikely you will be in a
hurry to have your code changed; otherwise, you or your employer should
contact the Revenue with the list price of the company car to have the code
revised as soon as possible.
How will the new
system work?
The amount on which you will pay tax at your marginal rate is 35 per cent of
the list price of the car the day before it was registered; this price must
include VAT, delivery charges, and any accessories of Pounds 100 and over.
The price is capped at Pounds 80,000, so that cars with a list price above
this amount will be taxed as though the price had been Pounds 80,000.
Drivers covering 2,500-17,999 business miles will have a reduction of a
third on their assessment, while those covering more than 18,000 will
receive a discount of two-thirds.
If your company car is four or more years old at the end of the tax year,
there will be a further one-third reduction on the figure after deductions
for business mileage.
The rules differ for classic cars or those without a list price. If a car is
15 years old or more at the end of the tax year, or has a market value of
Pounds 15,000 or more (which is higher than the manufacturer's list price
when the car was first registered), the price for tax purposes will be the
open market value of the car and its accessories.
Fuel provided for private use will be taxed on the basis of the car's engine
size and whether it is petrol or diesel-powered. But there is no tax if you
pay for private motoring fuel yourself.
You can also reduce your tax bill if you contribute towards the cost of the
car or its accessories to a maximum of Pounds 5,000 (including VAT).
Kevin Paterson, of accountant Ernst &amp; Young, says the new system throws up
some unfair anomolies. If it had been operating last year, two drivers doing
the same business mileage in a Ford Mondeo 1.8LX, one taking delivery in
March and the other in June, would have faced a Pounds 400 difference in
their car benefit charge.
This is because Ford changed the list price of the car at least twice in the
year.
Who will benefit?
Table 1 shows how to calculate if you will gain under the new rules. First,
identify into which of the five brackets your car falls under the old
system, based on its cost when new and its cylinder capacity.
Then, compare your car's list price to the break-even list price shown in
the first column. If the list price is greater than the break-even figure,
you are a loser; if it is less, you are a winner.
For example, all drivers of two-litre cars costing less than Pounds 19,250
will be hit if the list price of their car is greater than Pounds 12,814.
A survey released this week by WF Corroon, an actuarial and benefits
consultancy, found that middle managers driving mostly Fords, Vauxhalls and
Rovers costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600 would lose the most
under the new system, with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra tax.
Corroon's Ian Morgan said: 'Chairmen, chief executives and managing
directors who drive mainly Jaguars, BMWs and Mercedes, costing between
Pounds 28,000 and Pounds 39,000, are affected less, with about one in three
having to pay a higher tax bill and the remainder paying less.'
Table 2 shows the change to your tax bill if you drive one of the 20 cars
listed. Drivers of very expensive cars face the heftiest increase, while
those with the cheapest listed will see a fall.
There are some oddities caused by the way the old scale charges were
calculated. The driver of a Ford Granada 2.0i Ghia with a list price of
Pounds 19,150 will have to pay an extra Pounds 591 (on the assumptions
stated in the table).
But the driver of a Saab 9000 CSE 2.0i with a list price of Pounds 20,245
will see a fall of Pounds 594. This is because of the difference in the old
scale charge for the two cars.
'In general, the losers are those drivers who chose cars at the top of the
old bands,' says Paterson.
How to decide between
keeping the car or taking cash
Many company car drivers will have made this choice already, especially
after scale charges were raised by 8 per cent for the 1993-94 tax year.
Calculating whether you would be worse or better off is difficult because it
is hard to put a price on the convenience factor of driving a company car.
If it breaks down or is involved in an accident, you do not have the bother
of arranging a replacement or negotiating with the insurance company. And,
if the insurance premium goes up because of an accident, you do not have to
pay the increase.
'Perks' drivers who do not clock 2,500 business miles will pay
proportionately the largest amount of tax, since they will not benefit from
the discounts. If you are such a driver but must have a car, it might still
be more cost-effective to have a cheaper company one.
Maurice Fitzpatrick, of accountant Chantrey Vellacott, says that if you
forego the company car to take a salary increase instead (based on the
amount the employer saves by not providing you with a car), and then buy the
same car, you will be neither better nor worse off as a result.
But, he adds, you are likely to see a benefit by taking 'an increased salary
and then running a smaller car or one which does not fit the employer's
policy.'
Nilesh Shah, tax partner at accountant Blick Rothenberg, says most employees
driving a car with a retail price of Pounds 18,500, and doing more than
18,000 business miles, will do better to keep it since the taxable benefit
is reduced by two-thirds.
Shah adds that if you do decide to hand in the company car (or to buy it off
your employer at a favourable second-hand rate) and claim business mileage
on your own vehicle instead, be sure to negotiate the rate beforehand to
make sure depreciation is taken into account.
Another option is to switch to a company car with a cheaper list price or to
retain the company car if it is four years old. 'If the list price was
Pounds 10,000 in 1989, one-third of the value would be deducted because the
car is four years old,' says Fitzpatrick. 'The 35 per cent car benefit
charge would, therefore, be levied on Pounds 6,666.
'The same car new would probably cost about Pounds 13,000, taking inflation
into account, and the 35 per cent tax will be based on that amount. You have
almost doubled your tax bill as a result of having a new company car.'
Other ways of reducing the tax bill are to keep an eye on the number of
accessories in the car, especially if you do not have it for the whole of
the tax year. 'While the car benefit charge is reduced proportionately if
the car is unavailable for part of the year, the same principle does not
apply to accessories,' says Paterson. 'Accessories fitted part-way through
the year increase the car price for the complete tax year and subsequent
years.'
A number of organisations will calculate if retaining a company car is worth
your while. London-based accountant Kingston Smith charges Pounds 25 while
Wheawill &amp; Sudworth, another London accountant, will run the calculations
through a computer without charge.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A tax cut that you'll hardly see
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not every day that the government sets a tax rate at one level, only
to reduce it a few weeks later, writes Richard Lapper. But this is exactly
what has happened with the insurance premium tax, announced in the November
Budget. Unfortunately changes in the way the tax will be charged will offset
the impact of the reduction and consumers will hardly notice the difference.
The tax, which affects home, motor and some other insurances, will now be
charged gross rather than net - before, rather than after, brokerage
commission is deducted. The change will make it easier for insurance
companies to collect the tax, and the rate has been lowered - from 3 per
cent to 2 1/2 per cent - so as to reduce the extra burden on insurers and
their customers which would have resulted.
The yield - the amount of money raised - from the tax will now be about
Pounds 760m in its first full year, rising to Pounds 835m in 1996-97. That
compares with forecasts - calculated on the basis of a 3 per cent rate - of
Pounds 775m and Pounds 840m. Policyholders will still face average increases
of 35p a week on buildings, contents and motor insurance, although some
companies have promised to absorb the tax rather than passing on costs to
customers.
Some readers are wondering if the insurance tax can be avoided by
pre-payment, adds Bethan Hutton. But the government has taken steps to
prevent this.
Tax specialist Maurice Fitzpatrick, of Chantrey Vellacott, points out,
however, that by shortening the term of annual insurance policies so that
they expire in September, then renewing them for a year before October 1,
you will escape liability for the tax for another year. Whether insurance
companies agree remains to be seen.

FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Introduction (1): In
season, pick with care / Sales of Pep plans are still rising. . . and they
will continue to be a vital savings vehicle, says Barry Riley, provided they
are used in the right way, by the right kind of people

Personal equity plans are becoming a big business. From faltering beginnings
in the late 1980s they have been clocking up new sales peaks each year in
the 1990s; and during the current tax year ending on April 5 the number of
general plans sold could hit the one million mark.
Last year 770,000 general plans were sold, worth Pounds 3.12bn, together
with 140,000 single-company Peps worth Pounds 370,000. The total value of
old and new plans now in existence is a matter for guesswork, but, given the
strength of the stock market in the past few years and the surge in recent
sales, the total assets now held in Peps could easily be approaching Pounds
20bn.
The fall in interest rates during the past few years has stimulated the
marketing of Peps as a means of generating tax-free investment income, to
the competitive disadvantage of the building societies. And the bull market
in equities has provided the stimulus for demand which was sadly lacking in
the early days, in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash.
A clear indication of the way things have been going was provided by the
unit trust sales figures for 1993. Unit trusts (and to a lesser extent their
closed-end counterparts, the investment trusts) have been major
beneficiaries of the 1992 concession which allowed these collective funds to
make up a full Pounds 6,000 Pep, rather than only Pounds 3,000 as before. In
the April-December period, sales of unit trust Peps were worth Pounds 2.4bn,
a jump of more than 100 per cent on the figure for the same months of 1992.
With the peak sales season now under way, unit trust Pep sales could reach
something like Pounds 3.5bn for the fiscal year, and they are responsible
for perhaps two-thirds of all new general Pep business. In turn, Peps
accounted for as much as a third of the record Pounds 9.1bn of net sales by
unit trusts in 1993.
Evidently the tax advantages of Peps are being marketed to investors with
enormous impact. For many investors there are indeed great benefits. But
there are also doubts about how much of the tax advantage eventually comes
through to the bottom line as far as the average saver is concerned. Peps
are generally invested in risky assets, and the costs of the plans can be
quite high.
The original concept of the Pep was that it should be entirely invested in
equities (UK, later extended to the rest of the European Union) and exempt
from tax both on income and capital gains.
Unlike the personal pension plan, the other significant long-term tax
shelter, there is no income tax relief on payments into the scheme. On the
other hand, the assets in a Pep can be realised at any time; whereas
personal pension assets are locked away until retirement and must then be
used, in the main, to buy an annuity. So a Pep is much more flexible.
Moreover the relaxation of the Pep formula in 1992, which allowed up to half
the assets to be held in fixed-income investments, has encouraged product
innovation. The past year's big sales winner, for instance, has been the
Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Higher Income Plan, a controversial but cunning
'pepable' package designed to deliver 10 per cent tax-free income (albeit by
more or less eliminating capital growth potential).
For conventional plans, relying on both income and capital gains, the tax
advantages must be carefully assessed. With the average dividend income on
equities now well below 4 per cent, the benefit of standard-rate income tax
exemption is less than 1 per cent a year, compared with a typical annual
management charge of say 1 1/2 per cent (quite apart from the extra one-off
front-end charge levied on initial purchase).
In the circumstances, something of a price war has now broken out in the Pep
industry. Peps are not subject to the same restrictions as unit trusts, and
so alternative methods such as so-called 'exit' charges - that is, charges
levied on withdrawals within three or four years - are being tried out.
Savers should therefore keep their eyes open. The general advice is that,
although unit trust Peps can be expensive, the charges are often no higher
than on the underlying units. So if you are buying units in any case, it
often makes sense to buy them in the Pep wrapper. But comparisons with Peps
directly invested in shares can be complicated.
There is also the obvious point that the tax savings will be considerably
more valuable for people in the 40 per cent income tax bracket.
As for capital gains tax, only about 125,000 individuals actually pay this
levy at present, a small fraction of the number who are buying Peps. After
all, gains of up to Pounds 5,800 in a tax year are anyway exempt (Pounds
11,600 for a married couple) so only people with quite large portfolios and
making big transactions need worry.
Successfully avoiding CGT, however, can involve complex bed-and-breakfasting
of holdings and a nightmare of intricate inflation-adjusted arithmetic to
work out potential liabilities.
Alternatively, there is the Pep. The beauty of the personal equity plan is
that the benefits of the tax shelter grow over the long term. For serious
investors who intend to build up portfolios over many years, Peps should be
regarded as providing a basic and essential element of their tax planning.
Already investors who have been taking full advantage of their annual
entitlements from the beginning have accumulated sizeable tax-exempt
portfolios - which could easily be of the order of Pounds 100,000 for a
married couple.
At this level, the ability to switch investments freely, without regard to
CGT considerations, becomes of considerable importance. Remember that tax
savings worth just 2 per cent a year will roll up to a total extra
performance of some 50 per cent after 20 years.
So the important thing to bear in mind is that a personal equity plan has an
indefinite life, subject no doubt to the inevitable political uncertainties
in the long run. Once cashed in, Peps are gone for ever, but at the rate of
Pounds 6,000 a year (and Pounds 9,000 including single company plans) they
can provide an unrivalled framework for lifetime savings.
Peps are not for everybody. But so long as they are used in the right way,
by the right kind of people, they will continue to be a vital feature of the
savings market.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: The importance of a long-term view - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The falls this week in equity and bond markets should remind investors yet
again how the value of their holdings can go down as well as up. Many do not
need reminding, of course - you do not need a long memory to recall the
stock market crash of 1987.
Falls and rises of the order we have seen in the past few days are, in any
case, very small compared with 1987. Indeed, it is too easy to regard every
fall of any significance as a 'crash' and every rise as a 'boom.'
This week's market movement should not upset investors unduly. Many who went
into UK equities even as recently as the beginning of 1993 will have made
sizeable gains.
But the latest decline underlines the importance of regarding equities as a
long-term investment, precisely in order to be able to ride out temporary
setbacks.
Unit and investment trust savings schemes show their worth at these times,
not only because they give investors the discipline of putting aside some
money regularly but because, by doing so, they are able to buy more units or
shares when the stock market falls and fewer when it is high.
This 'pound/cost averaging,' as it is known in the trade, means investors do
not have to worry about getting market timing right - something which often
defeats even the experts.
Fund management houses are only too aware of the fears investors have about
protecting their capital. This has led to a proliferation of so-called
guaranteed equity products; in most cases these promise that, even if the
worst happens, people get back their original investment.
Now, a group of former Kleinwort Benson fund managers - calling itself
Objective Unit Trust Management - has launched a new unit trust which aims
to limit the risk of investing in the stock market.
The Objective Limited Risk Equity Fund will use derivatives to protect
against stock market falls.
The fund is managed so that the bid price (that obtained by investors for
selling units) at the end of each six-month period will not fall by more
than 5 per cent. The initial period starts on the first business day of
March.
The fund managers say that, to reduce risk, they will spread exposure across
the markets so that 50 per cent is invested in the UK and the rest is
divided equally between the US, Europe, Japan and the Far East.
The fund shares a common disadvantage of all guaranteed equity products in
that the investor does not benefit from the full rise in the market - this
is the price paid for the protective mechanism.
But, unlike guaranteed equity bonds which tend to have a lock-in feature
over five years, this fund will lock-in gains every six months and investors
are free to buy and sell units at any time.
Initial charge is 4.5 per cent and annual management fee is 1 per cent.
Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.

Fears this week of interest rate rises in the longer term pushed up rates on
the money markets where the building societies borrow funds for fixed-rate
mortgages. By Thursday night a number of lenders - including the Halifax,
Leeds, and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester - had axed their existing fixed-rate
mortgages.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester withdrew its 6.99 per cent, five-year fixed rate
while Leeds replaced a 5.85 per cent, two-year mortgage with two of 6.19 and
5.99 per cent (the cheaper one is for those borrowing only 80 per cent of
the value of the property). Two five-year mortgages of 6.75 per cent and
6.95 per cent were replaced with ones of 7.39 and 7.59 per cent.
Halifax has increased fractionally its old 7.2 per cent, five-year fixed
rate to 7.25 per cent, but its 10-year rate goes up from 7.99 to 8.25 per
cent.
Yesterday, the National Westminster bank withdrew a number of
recently-issued fixed rates; one had been a particularly attractive 10-year
fix at 7.59 per cent, which was lower even than standard variable rates.
Leeds also withdrew another mortgage, this time its 25-year, 8.99 per cent
fix.
Last week, I wrote that there was a danger that good fixed rates would begin
to disappear, especially since lenders were shifting the emphasis back to
variable rate loans. This is partly because the margin on variable rates is
much higher than on fixed rates.
Although six in 10 new mortgages are fixed rate, perhaps as many as 90 per
cent of all mortgages are still on a variable rate. But if your lender
offers a good fixed rate, there is nothing to stop you fixing all or part of
the mortgage to give some security against rising interest rates.
Avoid those which are tied to insurance-related products and make sure you
calculate if the costs involved in re-mortgaging are outweighed by the
interest savings.
Many analysts still expect the next interest rate movement in the UK to be
downwards, but rates will rise again as one cycle comes to an end and the
next begins. There is always a chance that fixed rates may decline further,
but they may not have scope to fall very far.
Unless you intend to pay down your mortgage over the coming years (capital
repayment incurs early redemption penalties), it is a good time to fix your
mortgage.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: Clearer picture from big five - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two things are clear after the first round this week of the results season
for Britain's five biggest composite insurance companies.
One: the sector is now emphatically back in profit after its weather and
recession-related problems of recent years: Guardian Royal Exchange started
the ball rolling on Tuesday with Pounds 183m (compared to Pounds 3m),
Commercial Union followed with Pounds 211m (against Pounds 27m) and Royal
Insurance - with a profit of Pounds 143m - is back in the black after losses
of nearly Pounds 600m over the last three years.
Two: the trading outlook over the medium term is marred by the prospect of a
re-emergence of price competition, already visible in what has historically
been the industry's most competitive market - motor insurance. The fear here
is that the entry of the new 'direct writers', telephone-based motor
insurers like Direct Line, and a renewal of interest in the UK by European
companies, as markets in France and Germany recover, will undermine pricing.
Next week Guardian Royal Exchange will increase competition in the motor
sector by launching its own direct writing company, Guardian Direct,
bringing the total of 'direct writers' to about a dozen. Already direct
writers are beginning to tackle the home insurance market.
John Chester, analyst at SG Warburg, noted: 'From the composites'
perspective, the normal cyclical influences are being overlaid by the
secular trend towards direct writing and consolidation in Europe. While many
lessons have been learnt from the heavy losses of recent years, the battle
ahead may be no less bloody. It would be particularly inconvenient if the
more recent favourable trends in claims reverses.'
Certainly this sentiment already seems to be affecting investor perceptions
of the sector. Insurers have underperformed the FT-SE A All-Share by about
20 per cent since last summer and by 7.1 per cent since the beginning of the
year. GRE's warnings of price competition on Tuesday were enough to send the
prices of all the composites firmly south, with the sector this week
underperforming by 3 per cent.
Profits are still expected to increase over the next 12 months as the effect
of price increases introduced between 1991 and 1993 feed through and losses
from recession-related claims, such as those from domestic mortgage
indemnity insurance, decline.
On some bases, therefore, a few of the stocks look attractive - although
analysts differ in their assessments.
Chester's view that Commercial Union should be the core holding in the
sector has many adherents. CU was the only composite to gain market share in
1992 and 1993, allowing it maximise profitability and placing it in a strong
position to shed business in the downturn.
Tom Bennett, of Banque Paribas Capital Markets, says: 'The general view in
insurance - like any other cyclical stock - is to buy when they are losing
money and sell when they are making profits.' Even so, he has buy
recommendations on both General Accident and a hold/buy for CU, partly
because both companies have higher than average exposure either to the US
and Canada or to Europe.
Higher than average yields should also provide comfort for CU and GA.
Supporters of Royal Insurance argue that the company's shares are
significantly undervalued at its present level. On Thursday's closing price
of 278p, the shares were trading on a prospective multiple of only 7 -
assuming 1994 profits of Pounds 290m. And, like Guardian Royal Exchange,
Royal is trading at a discount to its net asset value, while Sun Alliance,
Commercial Union and particularly General Accident are all trading at
premiums to NAV.
Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel, disagrees. He suggests, that Royal
has potentially significant exposures to US pollution claims. Even assuming
that Royal is able to increase its 1994 dividend by the same rate at which
it has increased the 1993 payout, the share still yields a prospective of
only 4.4 (on Thursday's closing price), lower than available elsewhere, says
Hodges.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: Share crash on information superhighway - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is beginning to look a little worrying. First, US bond markets post
heavy losses amid fresh concerns about the pace of economic growth and
inflation. Then, one of the largest corporate deals in US history - the
union between telecoms group Bell Atlantic and cable giant
Tele-Communications - collapses, simultaneously knocking the stuffing out of
merger-obsessed cable and communications stocks and creating a large pothole
in the much-vaunted information superhighway.
This nasty one-two punch left equity investors reeling, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average nursing a 52-point loss by Thursday's close. Since the
Federal Reserve pushed up the bank overnight lending rate from 3 per cent to
3.25 per cent on February 4, the Dow has taken three steps back for every
two steps forward. The net result is that the average has fallen 130 points,
or 3.3 per cent, in three weeks of erratic trading.
There are analysts on Wall Street who are unperturbed by these events, and
who scoff at reports that the failure of the Dow to break through the 4,000
level marks the end of the great 1990s bull market. Their sanguine view of
the recent selling is that it is part of a natural correction, a correction
that was inevitable in the wake of the Fed's decision to tighten monetary
policy.
While this argument is compelling (share prices were looking overbought at
the time of the Fed's move, so a rate increase provided an obvious
opportunity for the market to let off some steam), the recent surge in
long-term interest rates remains disturbing, not least because this was not
how it was meant to happen - at least according to the Fed's plan.
Remember, the logic behind the February 4 rate increase was that by pushing
up short-term rates early, the Fed would assure financial markets of its
commitment to tackle inflation, and create a climate in which long-term
interest rates could stay low, comfortable in the knowledge that the central
bank was ever-vigilant against the threat of an overheated economy and
rising prices.
Yet, since the Fed put up short-term interest rates, long-term interest
rates, as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, have risen
from 6.30 per cent to 6.73 per cent. The yield on the 30-year bond has not
been that high since June last year.
This rapid rise in bond yields concerns stock market investors primarily
because higher interest rates could undermine the robustness of the economy,
and slow the pace of corporate capital-raising. Also, if interest rates keep
rising, investors might eventually be lured away from stocks and into
higher-yielding fixed-income securities.
If this were not enough to worry about, the demise of the Bell Atlantic-TCI
deal has further dented the stock market's confidence. The collapse of the
merger, calculated to have been worth somewhere between Dollars 20bn and
Dollars 30bn, is worrying on several counts.
From a strategic point of view, the removal from the board of what would
have been the largest and most powerful player in the
cable-telecommunications game reduces the incentive for other cable,
telecoms and technology companies to forge similar alliances. Those
companies considering joining forces to compete with the Bell-TCI giant may
now be content to enter the new age of interactive information technology,
communications and entertainment on their own.
From a financial point of view, the fact that the main reason the merger
failed was because Bell and TCI could not agree on terms - Bell kept wanting
to pay less for TCI (mostly because regulators have ordered cable companies
to lower their cable television rates was likely to damage TCI's future
cash-flow) and TCI was increasingly troubled by the drop in Bell's share
price - means other companies seeking to conclude takeovers or mergers in
the industry will be more reluctant to pay the top dollar.
Moreover, unless the sharp drop in in the price of cable and
telecommunications stocks is reversed, it will be harder to pay for deals
with equity. One of the great features of today's mergers and acquisitions
boom is that so many companies have been funding their acquisitions with
stock. Last year, more than a third of all transactions in the US involved
companies swapping stock for stock.
Yet, if the value of stock starts declining (not just in the cable and
telecommunications sectors, but in the market as a whole, if the current
'correction' continues), then companies will be less willing to use equity
to pay for mergers or acquisitions. And, they are not going to be keen to
start funding deals with borrowed money if interest rates keep rising,
either.

Sun Life has held some of its with-profits reversionary bonus rates at 1993
levels, while cutting others, but terminal bonuses will generally be equal
to or greater than 1993 rates.
The maturity value of a 25-year with-profits endowment policy, taken out by
a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, will be Pounds 47,694 on April 1, a
slight rise from Pounds 47,575 last year. However, this is still at the
lower end of the scale compared to Sun Life's competitors, many of whom are
paying more than Pounds 60,000 on similar policies. A 10-year unitised
with-profits policy would pay Pounds 6,488.

</HEADLINE>

Gift Aid donations by individuals rose in December 1993 to Pounds 31.9m
compared with Pounds 25.5m the preceeding December. The total amount raised
in the three years to December 1993 is Pounds 588.6m, of which Pounds 334.4m
was provided by individuals. Gift Aid is designed for one-off donations to
charity, which are treated as net of basic rate income tax. This means a
gift of Pounds 250 becomes Pounds 333 in the hands of the charity. The
reduction of the minimum qualifying gift to Pounds 250, since last year, has
encouraged greater use of the scheme.

January was a relatively weak month for inflows into unit trusts although
they still retained their popularity with private investors. Net investment
of Pounds 490m was almost half the Pounds 895m invested in December. Autif,
the unit trust industry body, attributed the fall to heavy selling by
institutions in the Far East for profit-taking after last year's strong
performance in the region. Private investors accounted for a net Pounds 534m
investment last month. The most popular retail funds were international
growth and UK equity income funds.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: Shares sink as the cash tide flows out - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In like a lion, out like a lamb. We shall see whether March's proverbial
reputation applies to the stock market as well as the weather. Certainly the
last week of February has been tempestuous with a net fall of 100 points on
the FT-SE 100. Whether that makes the stock market a lion is another matter.
This week it looked more like a lamb being led to the sacrifice to atone for
losses incurred by the speculative US hedge funds.
By Thursday it seemed that the dam had well and truly burst - not the
Malaysian one which is still shoring up all sorts of possible troubles for
the UK government and companies, but the dam which has been supporting the
reservoir of liquid funds sloshing about world financial markets in search
of yield.
The crack which appeared when the Federal Reserve tightened three weeks ago
widened this week to let through a flood of selling, particularly in the
futures markets, threatening to carry away bond and equity markets alike.
It would be dangerous to spend too much energy trying to rationalise what
happened. There is little relevance to fundamentals if UK equities are
falling because of forced selling by leveraged investors whose original
mistake was to mis-judge the yen-dollar rate.
True, the worries in the New York bond market and a few choice words from
the chancellor's panel of independent forecasters raised doubts about the UK
interest rate trend. But none of the panel actually called for rates to
increase, and it is hard to see that happening while inflation remains low
and April's tax increases are as yet undigested.
The yield on equities is almost exactly twice that on gilts which does not
suggest they are particularly expensive.
Equities' relationship with index-linked gilts is less comfortable. The
yield premium against five-year index-linked issues has narrowed to only 1
percentage point from 2.4 points a year ago.
That suggests equities have little room to forge ahead unless gilts rally
and real yields fall again. There is a chance of this happening once the
hedge fund turmoil is over. With muted inflationary expectations, yields of
around 7 per cent gilts look appealing. The premium of nearly a full
percentage point over German government issues may also attract overseas
money but it would be foolish to expect the hedge fund liquidity to reappear
in a hurry.
Since equities are still trading on a relatively high price/earnings
multiple of around 23 times, the focus may shift away from those stocks
which benefit from falling interest rates towards those like manufacturing
and engineering issues which have genuine recovery potential.
Provided these can produce a strong earnings growth, there may be little
need for worry. If not, more trouble may lie ahead.
So far the company reported season has produced earnings just about in line
with expectations, with dividends overall slightly ahead of expectations.
The dividend record is distorted, however, by a few companies such as Glaxo
which have paid out exceptionally large increases. The picture afforded by
this week's results is distinctly mixed.
Some dividends were deceptively flattering. On Tuesday Unilever increased
its annual payment by 17 per cent to 25.03p per share in spite of a Pounds
490m restructuring charge and evident pressure on its branded goods market.
Shell Transport accompanied Thursday's announcement of a mere 3 per cent
rise in profits to Pounds 3.23bn with a 9.6 per cent increase in its
dividend. Both groups paid only modest increases in guilder dividends,
though, so the UK increase largely reflected currency movements. Unilever
ended the week off 76p at Pounds 11.30. Shell was down 27p at 702.
National Westminster's 6 per cent dividend increase on Thursday disappointed
after much higher payments by other banks, but NatWest is also plagued by a
relatively low capital base, sluggish loan demand and dependence on trading
profits. NatWest's shares finished the week down 42p at 497p.
In the real world of manufacturing, ICI's trading statement on Thursday was
marginally positive at best. Its 78 per cent increase in annual profits to
Pounds 290m was boosted by the effect of restructuring and exchange rate
movements and the dividend was held unchanged at 27.5p. The shares fell only
20p to 754p on the week, perhaps because of earlier under-performance.
British Aerospace increased its dividend by 19 per cent in spite of
reporting a Pounds 237m pre-tax loss on Wednesday after an exceptional
charge to cover further possible losses on aircraft leases.
The higher dividend reflects a swing in operating profits to a Pounds 229m
profit from a loss of Pounds 66m in 1992, which seems to justify BAe's
contention that it has finally turned round. The 8.3p dividend, though, is a
long way short of the 25p paid as recently as 1991. The shares closed down
21p at 505p
Exceptional charges pushed British Gas into a loss of Pounds 285m from a
profit of Pounds 681m in 1992. Though it expects a 50 per cent gross return
on its Pounds 1.65bn restructuring programme, the cash cost will be
considerable when gearing is rising.
What with that, its price cap, the threatened loss of market share as
competition develops and the low cover of 1.4 times, British Gas looks
pushed to deliver real dividend growth. Its payment increased only
marginally to 14.5p per share from 14.2p and its shares fell 23p to 318p
Finally, the clearing banks decided to cash in their gains and float the
venture capital group 3i on the stock market this summer. There will
undoubtedly be considerable interest in what could become a new FT-SE100
company. Yet if the banks, who have waited long enough, think now is a good
time to sell, it may not be the best moment to buy.

FT  26 FEB 94 / In the 27 years since the last great flood, there has been a
lot of discussion but little action to save one of the world's great
treasures, write David Lascelles and Robert Graham

<TEXT>
It was in November 1966 that Venice was swamped by the worst floods for
several centuries. The disaster woke the world to the perils facing one of
the treasures of western civilisation. But today, more than 27 years later,
not a stone has been laid to prevent a recurrence of the disaster, in spite
of the combined problems of subsidence and rising sea levels which threaten
the city.
'La citta non ha fatto nulla. The city has done nothing,' says Rinio
Bruttomesso, director of Citta d'Acqua, the Venice-based association of
waterfront cities. 'The Dutch have built new barrages, London has built the
Thames barrier. This city has nothing, only plans.'
Bruttomesso is certainly right about the plans. In a spacious palazzo on the
Campo San Stefano near the Accademia bridge, Francesco Bandarin, an
architect, has a detailed design for Venice's sea defences. He works for the
Consorzio Venezia Nuova, the government-appointed consortium of building and
engineering companies which was charged nine years ago with the task of
protecting Venice from floods.
He knows the problem in minute detail: the tidal currents, the type of
barrage needed, the cost, the timescale for construction. The plan is for an
elaborate system of barriers to close off the three large entrances to the
lagoon, consisting of rows of giant hollow metal boxes fixed to hinges on
the sea floor. When high tides threatened, they would be filled with air and
swung up to hold the water back.
Across the square, Bandarin's colleague, Paolo Baschieri, occupies a
building full of computers into which has been fed a mass of information
about the Venice lagoon: depth, temperature, concentrations of pollutants,
tidal charts. At the push of a button he can print-out maps showing whatever
the inquirer wants to know.
But apart from a working model of the proposed barrage, the practical
application has got no further. 'We've already spent more time waiting for
this project than it will actually take to build,' says Bandarin.
Like much of what happens - or does not happen - in Italy, the blame for
this state of affairs can be laid at the door of the politicians. In the
aftermath of the 1966 disaster, the Rome government made a prompt response:
it declared the city's fate a matter of national interest, and provided
money to enable work to start not just on flood protection but also cleaning
up the lagoon and restoring buildings.
Much has been achieved in these last two areas, partly with international
support. Many fine palazzos and churches have been re-opened. Shipping
channels have been dredged, and water treatment plants built on the edge of
the lagoon.
But Venice's problems have become increasingly caught up in the chaos and
corruption of Italian politics. At the national level, Rome created a
proliferation of laws and agencies to deal with its problems, but
persistently postponed the big decisions. When the Consorzio produced its
barrage proposals in 1989, the government sent them back because they were
too intrusive. Rome wanted a barrier that lay entirely hidden underwater.
So, in 1992, the Consorzio sent in revised plans which met these criteria.
The plans are still in the government's in-tray.
At the local level, the highly politicised Venetian administration fought
for state aid, not so much to protect the city as to have the money to
disburse patronage and influence. During the latter part of the 1980s,
Venice was cynically carved up between the Christian Democrats and
Socialists with a tacit deal to let the voluble Gianni De Michelis, the
Socialist foreign minister, become a latter-day Doge.
He, along with his entire Venice network, has been swept aside by the
corruption scandals which have rocked Italy in the past two years. Several
of these related directly to Venice: at one stage last year De Michelis was
assailed by a hostile crowd.
But politics is not the whole story. The longer the delay, the more doubts
have grown as to whether the grand barrier scheme is really the answer to
Venice's problems. Time has enlarged people's understanding of Venice's
predicament. Other perils have come to be viewed as equally threatening as
the famous floods. The position has become much more complex, the priorities
less clear.
Venice is now seen not just as a jewel to be saved but as part of a vast
environmental and economic system represented by the Venetian lagoon. Any
solution to Venice's particular problems must be balanced with regard to
other interests. This 550 sq km of water, for example, is home to Italy's
largest petrochemical complex, at Mestre, upon which 15,000 jobs depend.
Anything that interferes with the free movement of traffic in the lagoon or
activity on its shores could threaten their livelihoods.
The lagoon also receives the run-offs - and thus the mess - from nearly
2,000 sq km of the surrounding watershed. Then there are the less well-known
problems of Venice itself: the shortage of housing and jobs which is driving
away young people; lack of money to dredge the canals; absence of a proper
sewage system.
The key point in the new phase of the debate is whether the barrage should
be the top priority - whether it is even necessary. The Consorzio argues
that it is. According to Bandarin, Venice now suffers from a mild form of
flooding called alta acqua (high tide) more than 40 times a year, compared
with only six times at the start of the century.
This is partly because of rising sea levels, partly because Mestre's
industries have sucked out the ground water and caused Venice's foundations
to sink. The combined effect has been to leave Venice 23cm lower in the
water. Water laps above the impermeable Istrian stone which the resourceful
Venetians used to build their foundations, and soaks the brickwork, allowing
the damp to rise and attack the walls and plaster.
Bandarin calculates that the chances of a catastrophic flood have increased
from once every 800 years to once every 200. But is that a sufficient risk
to justify a project equivalent to half a Eurotunnel?
Paolo Costa, rector of the University of Venice, who occupies an office in
one of the palazzos overlooking the Grand Canal, says: 'The idea of
defending Venice from the sea is declining. It's technically difficult, and
there is uncertainty about the size of the risk.' People have learnt to live
with high tides, he says. They move their precious things upstairs and put
barricades across their doorways to hold the water back.
People have also begun to challenge the Consorzio's interest in the issue.
They accuse it of deliberately stirring up fears of floods in order to win
government contracting business for its members. It is certainly the case,
as the Consorzio concedes, that Venice's sinking problem appears to have
eased now that steps have been taken to halt the depletion of the aquifers.
But Bandarin raises the threat of global warming and the melting of the
polar ice caps. 'Do you see the sea being higher or lower in the years
ahead?'
He also rejects criticism of the Consorzio's 'big business' approach.
'There's been a noticeable cultural shift in this office away from big
engineering to incorporate environmental factors,' he says. Some 60 per cent
of the Consorzio's budget goes on environmental work, such as restoring
wetlands and bringing lost sediment back into the lagoon.
But even among those who share the Consorzio's view that floods are the
greatest threat, there is scepticism as to whether a barrage is the best
answer. They fear the project would upset the ecology and tidal flows of the
lagoon. Alternatives have been canvassed, such as filling in the shipping
channels to staunch the flood tides, but, as Bandarin points out, the
largest channel did not even exist at the time of the 1966 floods.
If support for the barrage is waning, what priorities are taking its place?
The clean-up of the lagoon is the strongest contender. Although much has
already been done to stop discharges of raw sewage and industrial effluent,
water quality is still poor, even filthy at times. The problem lies not just
with the local municipalities which are within Venice's control, but with
distant towns and villages bordering rivers which feed the lagoon. Much of
this pollution is agricultural nutrient which
causes eutrification - unnatural growth of algae - and threatens fish life.
Would it not be better if the right standards were applied across the
watershed?
Much of the clean-up campaign has also targeted Mestre's petrochemical and
oil refining industries, and the large tankers which have to enter the
lagoon to serve them. Last year, Carlo Ripa di Meana, then the environment
minister, visited the site and suggested that it would be good if industry
moved out. His remarks caused a furore and led to a demonstration by
industrial workers in the Grand Canal.
His words reinforced a body of opinion which argues that Mestre's industry
is inappropriate to the locality, and should be replaced with commerce and
light industry. Rinio Bruttomesso at Citta d'Acqua, for example, says Venice
would be better off if these 'dying industries' were replaced by a
commercial shipping terminal and a science and technology park. There is
also support for educational establishments to complement the two
universities in Venice itself.
But the management and workers at the state-owned Enichem plant are fighting
back. Lucio Pisani, the director, says the company has spent L125bn (Pounds
50m) on environmental improvements over the last three years, and now
returns water to the lagoon that is cleaner than that it took out. It is
only because Enichem is so big, he says, that it can afford such hefty
environmental investments. 'The problem of the lagoon is not
petrochemicals,' he says. 'We are a living demonstration that a
petrochemical plant can live alongside a historic city.'
Environmentalists would go a stage further and have the whole Venice lagoon
declared a national park. 'The lagoon is a very complex ecosystem,' says
Alberto Bargossi of Legambiente Veneto, a local environmental pressure
group. 'Each part can't be separated from the whole system and the problems
can't be solved separately. We have to face all the problems at the same
time.' But he adds: 'First of all we must stop polluting the water.'
Venice's fate is caught up in Italy's fast-changing political scene. Much
will depend on the outcome of the March 27 general elections, but already
the campaign against corruption, and public pressure for sound government
are having an effect, as the drubbing of De Michelis showed. In this
climate, Venice's future stands a better chance of being weighed on its
merits than of being bent to political ends.
The outgoing Ciampi government has taken an important step which should
begin to rationalise the bodies with a hand in Venice's future. In January,
a decree was approved to create a company with a L80bn capital which will be
majority-owned by the state, the rest split between the Veneto region,
Venice itself (which includes Mestre) and the coastal town of Chioggia.
The company will have responsibility for all conservation and environmental
activity related to the lagoon. This means that the Consorzio will be
downgraded and limited to studies and construction work relating to the
tides.
Italian local administration has also been opened up with new municipal laws
which enable mayors to be elected directly rather than chosen in
smoke-filled rooms. Last December, Massimo Cacciari, a philosophy professor
from Venice's Architecture University, was elected mayor under these rules,
heading a broad 'progressive' alliance backed by the Party of the Democratic
Left, formerly the communist party, and the green vote.
The city is waiting to see how he balances the pressures of the environment
with the region's social and economic demands. Marino Folin, rector of the
Architecture University, who knows Cacciari well, says he expects him to put
the development of Mestre and housing at the top of the list.
Cacciari has welcomed the new company because he wants to ensure that
environmental protection is better co-ordinated. He says: 'With this single
bridge from which to command, things can be pushed forward much faster and
more efficiently.'
Where this leaves the barrage is hard to say. Dr Luigi Zanda, the president
of the Consorzio, says the elections 'will have very positive repercussions'
by bringing much-needed stability to the political scene. 'We think 1994
will be a very important year for Venice because of the new mayor,' he says,
'and the fact that the government is creating the new agency to safeguard
Venice.' He still thinks the barrage can be built by the end of the century.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Long View: Trimming the hedges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation, my old textbook told me, was a good thing, in moderation. It
lubricated the market and helped provide the liquidity which enabled
long-term users of markets to move in and out. Sometimes, though, the
gambling gets out of hand.
This week we have seen the powerful impact of the unwinding of speculative
positions in the global securities markets. Bond prices have been tumbling -
the long gilt yield has soared from 6.5 to 7.3 per cent since the start of
the year - and London's FT-SE 100 Index took a dramatic 74-point dive on
Thursday.
Such corrections generate all sorts of rationalisations. People argue that
expectations about inflation have worsened, or that fears of rising
short-term interest rates upset sentiment.
Ostensibly the trigger for all the damage of the past few weeks - which has
seen Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumble by 15 per cent from its peak, for
instance, has been a modest quarter-point rise in dollar short-term interest
rates. But what we are actually seeing is a reversal in which the markets
are moving back to levels at which prices will again be set essentially by
long-term investors.
A clue to the nature of recent events can be discerned in the role of
derivatives. The biggest movements in the London stock market this week have
been seen in the blue chips which make up the Footsie Index, which in turn
is the basis of the Liffe futures contracts. Small capitalisation shares, in
which there is no derivatives-based trading, have remained comparatively
stable - although their prices are inherently more volatile because of poor
liquidity.
Another clue is that different kinds of securities have been tumbling in
price together. On Thursday, for instance, long-dated fixed interest gilts
and index-linked gilts were tailing sharply, just like equities. What has
been happening is not a reappraisal of prospects for economic growth or
inflation but an upward shift in real interest rates.
This is the most fundamental of all measures of the return to investors, and
it appears that so far there has been a rise of nearly half a percentage
point in the real long-term interest rate since the end of 1993. Last year
this rate declined, despite the surge in government and other borrowing
around the world which might have been expected to lead to a shortage of
savings.
Essentially what happened in the second half of last year was that large
inputs of speculative money entered the international securities markets.
Some of this was reflected in the banking statistics in the US and the UK,
which showed a sharp increase in lending to securities firms and investment
banks.
I have written before about the activities of US banks in making big profits
out of the spread between 3 per cent money market deposits and bond yields
of 5 or 6 per cent. An increasing role has also been played by the so-called
hedge funds, of which the most famous is George Soros's Quantum Fund (which
was this week reported to have lost Dollars 600m: on the recent unexpected
jump in the yen against the dollar).
The name 'hedge funds' is something of a misnomer. It certainly does not
mean that they hedge their risks. Today's hedge funds are the ultimate in
speculative offshore vehicles, ready to trade on any kind of financial
market, and often in commodities as well, and prepared to leverage the risks
and returns by taking on positions which are several times as large as their
underlying capital.
Hedge fund managers receive hefty performance-related fees, often of
something like a basic 2 per cent of funds managed, topped up with 20 per
cent of any gains over a modest benchmark rate of return. There is thus a
strong temptation to go for broke, because the managers can earn millions if
their geared-up gambles pay off. If things go wrong investors can lose
everything but managers only lose their jobs.
Operators like Soros have been playing this game for years but the talk
recently has been of the establishment of several new hedge funds. Last year
the profits were generally spectacular as markets around the globe trended
higher, with a particular surge in the final quarter as new money piled in,
The trouble is there are no statistics which might shed reliable light on
the volume of this kind of speculative money (although Fortune magazine this
week estimated that the worldwide total value of all kinds of derivative
contracts is about Dollars 16,000bn). Risks arising from major shifts or
even panics can only be guessed at.
The activities of aggressive players on this kind of scale can lead to a
kind of feedback - which Soros, an intellectual among speculators, has
dubbed reflexivity. Rising markets suck in still more money until the bubble
bursts; new hedge funds can find backers in these circumstances. The biggest
of all these bubbles in terms of capital committed - although by no means in
terms of size of capital gains - appears to have been in US Treasury bonds.
Prices peaked out as long ago as last October, since when the interest rate
on long-dated dollar bonds has risen by almost a full percentage point. The
game subsequently shifted to European bonds, but this gamble is now coming
to grief as well.
Naturally the market is buzzing with scare stories about the size of the
losses suffered by some of the hedge funds and banks. The motive of Quantum
Fund in disclosing a figure appears to have been to counteract some of the
wilder rumours. There is no way of knowing how long the sell-off will
continue. But in the bond markets, at least, yields have now climbed to
levels at which long-term investors are going to start absorbing the paper
being dropped by the short-term players. I would not be so confident about
UK equities; the average dividend yield on UK equities offers too small a
margin over the 3.3 per cent real yield on index-linked gilts.
There is trouble when speculation produces not liquidity, as in my textbook,
but liquidation.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets end on nervous note after week of heavy selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European bonds and stocks ended a hectic week sharply lower yesterday,
although the heavy selling of previous days eased.
European bonds tumbled again in early trading yesterday after an overnight
drop in US Treasuries. But the markets stayed calm, and ended above their
lows. 'It wasn't the same panic that gripped the markets Thursday,' said a
London bond trader.
Stock markets in Europe steadied but remained nervous as they kept a close
watch on bond prices. The best performance was in London, where the FT-SE
100 Index closed 13.7 higher at 3,281.2 on the firmness in UK government
securities.
The UK government bond market posted the biggest gains among European
markets yesterday, having lost the most ground the day before. The Liffe
March long gilt futures contract ended at 112 13/16 , up of a point. Gilts
bounced back from Thursday's lows as investors switched from other European
markets, which continued to fall amid bearish sentiment. German 10-year
bonds ended nearly a  1/2 point lower while their French counterparts
dropped by more than  3/4 of a point. Both markets are expecting fresh
long-dated paper to be issued next week which subdued sentiment.
According to Salomon Brothers, world government bonds lost 0.95 per cent in
local currency terms in the week to Thursday. Although US Treasuries sparked
the European sell-off, they ended down 0.88 per cent, outperforming the
non-dollar sector which dropped 0.99 per cent. Gilts posted the largest
losses on the week to Thursday, falling 3.05 per cent.
In London, share prices made uneven progress and investors remained cautious
on expectations that the US may again raise interest rates. Trading volumes
were moderate. The UK stock market fell by about 3 per cent during the week.
'It's a psychological market that's not driven by any fundamental factors,
so it's very hard to predict,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with
market analysts IDEA.
The recovery in confidence in UK equities was helped by comments from
leading analysts that domestic interest rates were unlikely to rise in the
near term.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Tories' European allies insist on federal stance : Manifesto
will highlight divisions in the party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's difficulties over Europe worsened yesterday as the
Conservative party's allies in the European parliament insisted that the
party would be committed to federalism after the European elections in June.
Conservative leaders have distanced the party from the federalist manifesto
of the European People's party since its contents were disclosed in the
Financial Times on Thursday.
The manifesto, published in Brussels yesterday, calls for economic and
monetary union (Emu), supports the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty
and commits the EPP to European integration under a single constitution.
Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the 32 Conservative MEPs, said in a letter
to the FT today the Tory party had 'no formal links' with the EPP and did
not negotiate the text of the manifesto.
However, the minutes of the EPP meeting which approved the manifesto on
February 3 show that Sir Christopher and other Conservative MEPs were
present.
Mr Thomas Jansen, EPP secretary-general, said they were present as observers
because they were members of the EPP parliamentary group, which whips its
members on Westminster lines and has common spokesmen on departmental
issues.
He said the British MEPs did not vote, but added: 'Between the EPP and the
EPP parliamentary group there is no difference. We consider the
parliamentary group as an active part of the EPP, and all the senior
officers of the EPP parliamentary group participate in our business.'
Mr Jansen said the EPP would not insist on British acceptance of those
elements of the Maastricht treaty from which Mr John Major, the prime
minister, secured an opt-out.
This means that Conservative MEPs will not be committed after the election
to support the group's position on the social chapter or Emu. But Mr Jansen
and Mr Wilfried Martens, EPP leader, said the rest of the document would be
binding on elected MEPs, including the federal and constitutional
provisions. 'It will form the framework on which the EPP and EPP
(parliamentary) group will operate after the European election,' Mr Jansen
said.
Mr Martens said he understood the difficulties facing British Conservatives,
and insisted that the EPP commitment to federalism was intended to protect
national diversity.
However, the manifesto will further irritate Conservative Euro-sceptics at
Westminster, who dislike the link with the EPP. The Bruges group, which has
close links with Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, urged
Conservative candidates to distance themselves from the EPP. It said the
manifesto was an 'obvious attempt to establish political union.'
The divisions will also be exploited by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in
the June 9 elections. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the
manifesto 'has obviously been kept under wraps for several weeks to avoid
embarrassment to the Conservative party. It clearly shows that the Tories
are not just divided over Europe, they are divided from Europe'.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Insurance chief calls for delay on industry watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, has called for
a delay in setting up the new financial services watchdog so that an
alternative plan can be considered.
His call comes within a week of the publication of details about how the
Personal Investment Authority intends to operate. Completed application
forms for firms and individuals to be admitted to the new regulator -
scheduled to open for business in July - are due to have been filed by early
April.
Mr Greener, whose role puts him at the top of two of the UK's largest
insurance companies, suggested yesterday that a deferment of a few months
would be better than forcing firms to decide their regulatory future under
such time pressure.
Given that the process of setting up the PIA had already taken over two
years, he said: 'I can't see what difference six months would make.'
Mr Greener has produced alternative proposals for a single private
investment regulator, which address training, costs, and compensation
arrangements. A paper has been circulated within parts of the industry, and
a copy is to be sent to Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary.
It envisages a two-tier arrangement, where an executive committee of people
working in financial services is supervised by a board of public interest
directors.
Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, said yesterday the proposal was interesting but
'has come very late in the day'.
Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, and Mr Palmer have already begun
meeting financial services practitioners to give more detailed explanations
of how the PIA intends to work.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If this insurance cycle is going to be less painful than the last, investors
are loathe to believe it. This week's sell-off in the sector - sparked by
Guardian Royal Exchange's observation that personal insurance rates are
softening - is only the latest leg in a run of underperformance stretching
back to the summer. The market is right to be sceptical. With solvency
margins back around 60 per cent, the big composite insurers are again well
endowed with capital. New entrants from continental Europe and direct
writers backed by banks can only add to the competitive pressure.
The memory of underwriting losses should be fresh enough to maintain
discipline on underwriting for a time. The snag is that not all insurers
have an equal incentive to hold the line on rates. With costs well below
those of traditional companies, direct writers could afford to chase rates
lower and still show decent profits. Established insurers would then face an
uncomfortable choice between ceding business and following rates down.
If the big insurers are serious about underwriting for profit rather than
market share this time around - even if that means writing fewer policies -
they already risk being over capitalised. Higher dividend payments would be
one answer, although the companies are rightly wary of setting dividends at
an unsustainable level. Should solvency creep substantially higher, the
promise of share buy-backs would help inspire confidence that this cycle
will indeed be different.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock exchange set itself a difficult task with this week's guidelines
on corporate disclosure. While it wants to see a strong flow of information
from companies, it also wants to help them keep within the bounds of the new
insider trading legislation. Since the now notorious LIG and Shanks &amp; McEwan
cases, some companies have been frightened even to answer the phone to
analysts. One purpose is to impress on them that it is all right to release
information, provided it goes through the proper channels. The more
information that there is in the public domain, the less insider trading is
likely.
Yet the guidelines bear the hallmarks of a committee of practitioners who
secretly hanker after the status quo. There is little in them to force
change on companies that have been using insider dealing worries as a reason
for clamming up. The definition of what constitutes price-sensitive
developments is inevitably vague. Companies are urged to report such
developments even during the close season, but the exchange has no means of
making them do so.
The central point is that an urge to clamp down on the illicit use of
information needs balancing with increased coercion on companies to
disseminate information widely. The disclosure debate has brought positive
developments, such as formal statements by retailers on Christmas trading.
But a more structured approach may be required, which leaves companies less
room for discretion in what they reveal. Quarterly reporting is a blunt
instrument, but it need not require audited figures and can be a timely way
of updating the market. It is a bullet which UK finance directors may yet
need to bite.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some semblance of calm returned to the equity market yesterday. It is too
early to know whether the spasms emanating from the bond markets have
passed. Gilts recovered yesterday too, but they were more picking up ground
lost to other European markets on Thursday rather than staging a genuine
rally. If the more tranquil mood continues next week, it will be interesting
to see what happens to this week's wilder fears about interest rates.
So negative was the market's mood that it was bound to take badly to the
suggestion from the chancellor's panel of advisers that the next move in
interest rates could be up. Yet none of the advisers are calling for rate
rises now and two want cuts. Having regained their poise, equities could
revert to a sunnier view of rates. That could produce a rally, but it would
not necessarily be durable.
There is an air of lost innocence about interest-rate expectations now that
the Federal Reserve has tightened. The chancellor's panel expects UK rates
to rise next year when, incidentally, taxes will increase yet again. A
falling savings rate may then no longer support consumer demand and the
fundamentals will look less propitious. The real selling has yet to begin.
It may take time, but it will come.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada's Blind Date
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada's chief executive, Mr Gerry Robinson, gambled by not paying up to
secure LWT's approval for his bid. It was a close call but he won the bet.
Granada's shareholders will be grateful for his parsimony. But he will still
have to work hard to prove that a two-and-a-half day London television
franchise, controlling 12 per cent of the ITV advertising market, is worth
much the same as BMW paid for Rover. That task may be complicated by the
bid's hostility. There are bound to be ructions as LWT is embraced into the
Granada fold. It would certainly be a shame if LWT's talented managers were
dispersed. At least, they are well provided for.
The inclusion of LWT means Granada will earn about a third of its profits
from television with an additional 13.5 per cent stake in BSkyB. That
suggests Granada's shares are more likely to track racier media stocks than
leisure companies. But they may prove soggy while the market digests the
newly-issued shares. LWT's managers, who own 10 per cent of their company,
seem certain sellers - unless they fancy haunting Mr Robinson at shareholder
meetings. Others, too, may want to bale out at this point.
Assuming a small take-up of the cash alternative, Granada's gearing will
only rise marginally to about 65 per cent by the year-end. All its
businesses are highly cash-generative, however, and borrowings should be
quickly reduced. It will not be long before the market starts
second-guessing what Granada will buy next to offset its declining rental
income. Its acquisitive growth may seem worryingly reminiscent of some 1980s
glamour stock. Granada has to show it will not end the same way.

FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sagging Dow unable to obtain
uplift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were mixed yesterday as investors tried to shake off the lingering
effects of Thursday's big sell-off, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
In a break from the recent pattern, the blue chip index was the laggard. By
the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.12 at 3,838.78, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 pushed 1.80 ahead to 466.06.
NYSE volume reached 274m shares.
The secondary markets showed some improvement. The American SE composite was
1.87 ahead at 467.45, while the Nasdaq composite gained 4.34 to 783.78 as
technology stocks bounced back.
Investors took advantage of a quiet session to adjust their positions in the
wake of a 51-point drop in the Dow industrials the previous day.
Bargain-hunters turned out early, lifting the bellwether index by 15 points
at the opening. However, the bounce was short-lived, and share prices soon
sagged in listless mid-morning trading.
A firmer trend in the US Treasury market provided little positive
motivation, even though plunging bond prices had contributed to the swoon in
stocks on Thursday.
Bell Atlantic, which triggered Thursday's rout with its decision to scuttle
its proposed merger with Tele-Communications Inc, slipped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 54 1/8 . But US West was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 40 1/2 . The
regional telephone group has a Dollars 2.5m stake in Time Warner's
entertainment division. On the Nasdaq, TCI's A shares, which dropped Dollars
1 7/8 on the news of the merger's collapse, rebounded Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 24, after Mr John Malone, its chairman, succeeded in reassuring
money managers on the company's strategic goals.
Among other technology stocks hit hard the previous session, DSC
Communications tacked on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 1/4 , Antec took back
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 1/4 . and Cisco Systems regained Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 73 1/8 . Informix rallied Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 23 3/8 after
Salomon Brothers upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'. A notable
exception to the positive trend was Sybase, a software developer, which slid
Dollars 3 to Dollars 43 1/8 .
Mexico
Equities ended a volatile session modestly higher as investors took
positions and then profits in quick succession. The 36-share IPC index ended
up 4.06 points or 0.16 per cent to 2,596.39.
A total of 145.6m shares had traded, with advances topping declines 57 to
26.
The index moved between a low of 2,566.43 and a high of 2,611.66 during the
session. It closed the week down 112.83 points or 4.16 per cent.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended the week on a positive note, closing solidly higher in
moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 35.11 points, or 0.81
per cent, to 4,364.23, for a loss on the week of about 14 points.
Advances edged declines 385 to 365, volume of 58.69m shares was down from
68.92m. Trading value was CDollars 786.4.

FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bond market keeps pressure on
Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continent finished a hectic week in a calmer mood, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT was pressured by the bond market and the Dax index closed at its
lowest level since November, off 15.37 at 2,074.92, a loss of 3.6 per cent
on the week. The March Dax futures contract lost 8 to 2,080 and in the
post-bourse the Ibex fell 7.60 to 2,075.32.
There were some rises during the day, in spite of the generally negative
tone: BMW climbed DM5.50 to DM821.50 and Lufthansa DM2 to DM172.50.
Daimler-Benz fell further in the post bourse on news after the session
officially closed that the group plans to make a rights issue, possibly in
the summer,to raise some DM3bn. The shares closed the session off DM8 at
DM807.50, before slipping to DM804.00.
ZURICH paid less attention to corporate results or the day's positive news
on inflation than to movements in the Bund future. The SMI index shed 29.1
to 2,929.3 for a 3.2 per cent fall over the week.
UBS suffered a bout of early profit-taking after reporting a 69 per cent
rise in group net profit, but smaller than expected rise in the dividend.
The price subsequently picked up at midday before news filtered through that
Merrill Lynch had downgraded the issue from a hold to a sell, leaving the
stock to finish SFr38 or 2.6 per cent lower at SFr1,413.
Mr Ian McEwan at Merrill Lynch said that the downgrade reflected concern
about rising costs, which would not easily be reversed, and the view that
the bank's strong income growth could be be maintained coming years.
Bearer shares in CS Holding dipped SFr11 to SFr674 and SBC shed SFr15 to
SFr465.
Among industrials, Alusuisse registered shares bounced SFr37 higher to
SFr629: on Thursday the company forecast higher profits in the current year
after a 30 per cent fall last year.
PARIS enjoyed a calmer day than in recent sessions with the CAC-40 index
losing just 9.37 to 2,198.92, for a week's loss of 2.3 per cent.
Turnover was moderate at some FFr4bn.
Pechiney dipped FFr2.70 to FFr199.30 after the chairman said that forecasts
that 1993 profit would excede that in 1992 were probably a little too
optimistic.
MILAN staged a technical rebound which was reflected in a 62 rise to 10,483
in the real-time Mibtel index, while the the Comit index, finding strong
support the 650 level, eased 0.56 on the day to 655.10, a cumulative 4.9 per
cent fall over the week.
BCI added L56 to L5,929 in volatile trading ahead of the start of the public
share offer on Monday. Forecasts yesterday were for a privatisation price,
being set this morning, of around L5,500.
Industrial blue chips saw some of the best gains. Fiat added L108 to L4,793
and Ifil, the holding group, put on L157 to L6,104.
Olivetti , continuing to benefit from speculation that it will win a second
mobile telephone licence added L53 to L2,323.
STOCKHOLM fell in line with other continental markets while Atlas Copco went
against the trend with a rise of SKr16 to SKr448 following good results on
Thursday.
The Affarsvaerlden general index lost 0.2 per cent to 1,534.8.
Astra eased SKr2 to SKr175 following the release of preliminary 1993
results.
Turnover rose to Skr2.4bn from Skr2.1bn.
ISTANBUL fell some 4 per cent in another volatile session driven by bearish
sentiment in spite of some midsession buying.
The composite index lost 727.66 at 16,199.5, for a week's decline of 16 per
cent.
Of the traded 165 shares, 129 fell, 20 rose and 16 were stable.
Erdemir, the Iron and steel group, was the most active, stock, closing off
TL200 at 4,050.
Turnover was TL1,230bn.
ATHENS rose slightly in light trading after three straight losing sessions.
The general index put on 4.15 to 1,068.90.
Credit Bank was the most active share, rising 4 per cent to Dr20,995 on news
of an increased dividend.
Turnover was low at about Dr5bn in volume of 1.3m shares.

FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying keeps
Nikkei buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of earlier cautiousness following Thursday's fall on overseas stock
markets, active buying by foreign investors supported share prices, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose a moderate 37.90 to 19,803.38, up 4.4 per cent
on the week, on buying concentrated on multimedia related high-technology
stocks. The index fell to a day's low of 19,579.16, then rose to a high of
19,890.89 as active foreign buying absorbed selling by institutional
investors and arbitrageurs.
Volume was 430m shares against 483m. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said
buying orders from continental Europe were growing. However, most domestic
institutions remained inactive as corporate profit-taking was expected to
continue through to the first half of March.
Declines led advances by 540 to 481 with 158 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks rose 2.25 to 1,609.87 and the Nikkei 300
gained 0.55 to 298.07.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.39 to 1,345.23.
High-technology issues gained ground. Hitachi, the day's most active issue,
rose Y22 to Y937, while Sanyo Electric gained Y14 to Y486. Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone rose Y1,000 to Y952,000 on reports that the company would
apply for a price rise in local calls to the ministry of post and
communications next month.
East Japan Railway advanced Y2,000 to Y505,000. Car companies were also
popular among foreign investors, with Toyota Motor up Y50 to Y1,990 and
Nissan Motor rising Y22 to Y840. Banks were lower on corporate
profit-taking. Sakura Bank declined Y40 to Y1,470 and Nippon Credit Bank Y70
to Y4,770.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 129.39 to 21,944.88 in volume of 62.4m
shares.
Roundup
The region remained turbulent yesterday. Manila and Bangkok were closed for
holidays.
AUSTRALIA fell to its lowest close in seven weeks, driven down by declines
on overseas markets and weaker futures and bonds.
The All Ordinaries index lost 48.2 to 2,148.8, off 3.3 per cent across the
week.
Stocks were hit across the board, with some ADollars 480m of option expiries
boosting volume to 387m shares valued at ADollars 1.1bn.
BHP slumped 46 cents to ADollars 17.76 and News Corp 26 cents to ADollars
9.76. The resources sector lost 2.8 per cent with Western Mining down 25
cents to ADollars 7.05.
HONG KONG fell 3.2 per cent on fears of higher interest rates but strong
profits by HK Gas helped the Hang Seng index to remain above the 10,100
level. The blue chip index lost 331.77 to 10,100.25, for a 6.7 per cent fall
on the week. Turnover climbed to HKDollars 7.22bn from Thursday's final
tally of HKDollars 4.39bn.
China Gas rebounded from a low of HKDollars 18.30 to end 20 cents higher at
HKDollars 19.60 after announcing a 21.3 per cent rise in 1993 profits.
SINGAPORE was weakened by worries about further US interest rate rises and
the poor performances in other major markets. The Straits Times Industrials
index fell 27.85 to 2,357.39, 1 per cent higher over the week.
The market for speculative Malaysian shares traded over the counter was
unaffected by a Malaysian 'Buy British Last' policy but institutional
traders thought that British investors might be disinclined to commit more
funds in Malaysian stocks.
KUALA LUMPUR finished off the day's lows on afternoon bargain hunting after
shares took a tumble in the morning due to weaker overseas markets and
concerns over Malaysia's retaliation to British allegations of an 'arms for
aid' controversy. The composite index closed 22.30 lower at 1,124.11, but
still 3.5 per cent higher over the week.
NEW ZEALAND reacted to losses elsewhere in the region with the NZSE-40
capital index down 52.99 at 2,216.28. The index has lost 3 per cent on the
week.
Carter Holt Harvey and Lion Nathan declined 15 cents to NZDollars 3.70and 23
cents to Dollars 3.75 respectively.
SEOUL saw heavy profit-taking in blue-chip shares pull the composite index
down 12.39 at 919.76, a week's decline of 0.6 per cent.
In spite of the fall, Kolon Industries rose Won700 to Won34,300 on
unconfirmed rumours that it was leading the race to win a bid to operate a
second mobile phone network. The Federation of Korean Industries will
announce the winner between Kolon and Posco, the steelmaker, on Monday.
Posco dipped Won1,800 to Won63,300.
TAIWAN was supported by good results from Cathay Life Insurance, which rose
TDollars 5 at TDollars 243. The weighted index shed 4.13 to 5,666.58 in
turnover of TDollars 51.4bn from Thursday's TDollars 46.4bn. The market has
lost 3 per cent this week.
KARACHI closed at a record high, helped by strength in banks and energy
stocks. The KSE 100-share index rose 9.99 to 2,465.10, surpassing the
previous record of 2,457.40 set on January 18. Volume rose to 9.3m shares
from yesterday's 5.6m shares.
Overseas funds took a keen interest in energy stocks after the government
announced incentives to power industries.
BOMBAY rose sharply on across the board buying by speculators and foreign
and domestic institutions ahead of Monday's annual budget, which is expected
to lower corporate income tax and the custom and excise duties. The BSE
30-share index rose 104.63 or 2.5 per cent to 4,236.96 for an 8.2 per cent
rise over the week.

FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam braced forvolatile trading
ahead - Outlook still optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jitters about interest rates have put a temporary halt to recent rises on
the Amsterdam stock exchange. Analysts are confident that the upward trend
will resume in spite of this month's upheavals. But they also expect a
volatile few weeks ahead as the market examines annual results for 1993 and
corporate predictions for 1994 against a background of nervous worldwide
equity trading.
Amsterdam's prospects are underpinned by the cost-cutting carried out by
major companies since the early 1990s, putting them in a good position to
benefit from global economic recovery. At the same time, the economy, which
never slipped into recession like Germany, seems on course for growth of 1
per cent in 1994 and 2.5 per cent in 1995. Inflation is expected to remain
at just 2 per cent.
As always with the stock exchange, however, the strong international
orientation of its biggest companies makes it especially vulnerable to
external risks, such as a tightening in US monetary policy and fears of
Russian instability.
Amsterdam has been thrown off balance since the US Federal Reserve's
increase in interest rates on February 4. Concern about interest rates is
understandable because the bourse's sharp gains of 1993 and early 1994 were
driven mainly by the resolute decline in worldwide interest rates.
The AEX index, which surged by 45 per cent to a record 414.27 in 1993, added
a further 6 per cent to finish January at 438.71. February's bout of nerves
have erased most of last month's gains, and the index closed yesterday at
415.64.
Nervousness about interest rates has not prompted Dutch banks to make any
changes to their forecasts for the stock market, which call for further
gains in 1994 after the spectacular surge of 1993. Unlike 1993, however, the
upward trend this year is expected to be punctuated by periodic and more
volatile corrections.
In its latest stock market survey, ABN Amro stands by its previous
prediction that the AEX index will stand above 450 by the end of June. It
notes that this will come despite the ex-dividend period that traditionally
takes place in May.
Other banks and stockbrokers are also sticking by their predictions of rises
ahead. The consensus is that the wider CBS All-Share Index will rise to 310
by year-end, compared with around 288 yesterday. Some caution that the rises
may not come until the second half.
With short-term interest rates already very low, the influence of interest
rates will wane later in 1994 as room for cuts disappears. Expected
improvements in corporate profits, which are forecast for 1994 and
especially for 1995, are then expected to take over as the main motor behind
further gains.
Mr Heinie Hakker of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Amsterdam says: 'The Dutch
business community has been working hard on rationalising in order to adjust
to more competitive conditions. The market is looking to see this translated
into profits.'
This week, the 1993 corporate reporting season got under way in earnest,
with annual results from Unilever, Royal Dutch/Shell, Hagemeyer and Akzo,
among others.
The picture so far is coloured by the negative reaction to Unilever, which
yesterday had fallen to Fl 213.70 after unveiling results on Tuesday, a
week's decline of 5 per cent. Royal Dutch fell by Fl 6.00 to Fl 202.70 on
Thursday after announcing only a slight rise in 1993 profits, closing
yesterday at Fl 201.70. Both companies' results were affected by
restructuring charges.
Together, the two account for well over 60 per cent of market cap, and they
exert a preponderant influence both over sentiment and the market's indices.
But they are hardly representative of the bourse as a whole, and interest is
focused particularly on the more cyclical companies and what they say about
the profit outlook for 1994.
Akzo was rewarded yesterday for its better-than-expected fourth quarter
results with a strong rise in its share price to just below Fl 214,
recouping practically all of the previous day's sharp losses. The company
said it now expected 'positive' developments in 1994, thanks in part to the
fact that it believed the recession in Europe had bottomed out.
Brokers' recommendations and Hoogovens' successful rights issue in late 1993
helped push up the company's shares to a 12-month high of Fl 64.70 on
February 10. They have since fallen back to Fl 59.40, but analysts say there
is room for further gains, particularly if aluminium prices stabilise.
Mr Fokko Tuin, an analyst at Kempen &amp; Co in Amsterdam, said the importance
of corporate earnings as a market factor may not emerge until September,
when first-half figures are published and anticipation about 1995 develops.
'In 1995 some of the cyclical companies could show big jumps in profits,' he
said. He too believes Amsterdam will rise during 1994.
Subscriptions for the partial privatisation of KPN, the state-owned
telecommunications and postal company, open in early June. The company, with
an estimated total market capitalisation of up to Fl 22bn, would rank third
in size behind Royal Dutch and Unilever.

FT  26 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious recovery as UK bonds move
higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steadier trend in domestic bond markets helped stem the setback in UK
equities yesterday and the FT-SE Index managed to recover a fraction of the
ground lost in the dramatic setback of the previous session. The recovery
was fragile, however, and although market strategists sounded more confident
on the outlook for European interest rates, they were resigned to a further
tightening of policy by the US Federal Reserve in the near future.
The bond markets continued to exercise powerful sway over equity trading.
Firmness in short-dated UK gilts reinforced views that domestic interest
rates are unlikely to rise in the near term, and there was a good recovery
in longer dated government bonds which had fallen severely on Thursday.
At the close, the longs were below the day's best levels with net gains of
around  1/4 of a point, while the shorts had gained around  5/8 . Some
traders detected the hand of the Bank of England as a buyer of government
bonds. A rate cut in Belgium had little effect on sentiment in London.
The Footsie traced an erratic path as the stock market kept a close eye on
bonds. Early deals saw the Index down by 24 points as the last of the
overnight seales passed through the market. Shares then turned smartly
higher, only to fade as some continental European markets softened, before
moving up afresh to touch the day's peak of 3,283.3 on the Footsie, a net
gain of more than 15 points when first deals on Wall Street looked
favourable - but for only a few moments.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,281.2, a gain of 13.7 on the day.
The Mid 250 Index remained easier, shedding a further 3.1 to 3,919.9. Seaq
volume increased to 792.5m shares yesterday from the relatively unimpressive
753.8m recorded during Thursday's heavy fall in the market. Stock Exchange
statistics disclosed that retail, or customer business, on Thursday was
worth Pounds 1.7bn, not by any means a record figure.
Last night also brought the end of a two-pressure week equity trading
account which has seen the London stock market fall by about 2.9 per cent as
it has become increasingly concerned by the signs that the US Federal
Reserve is tightening credit policies. This week has seen the pace quicken
and the Footsie drop by 101.4 points in the wake of testimony to Congress by
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Analysts of the London equity market remained relatively favourable on the
near-term outlook. Mr Marcus Grubb of Salomon International joined the ranks
of those seeing this week's fall as signalling 'time to buy.'
Among London's investment banks, NatWest Markets described recent events as
'A setback, not a bloodbath,' while SG Warburg commented, 'The froth blows
off.'
There was some weariness both in the market and among traders as dealing
came to a close yesterday. The modest weight of selling in equities left
marketmakers to take the brunt of the rapid fall in share prices.
Coupled with increased activity in the derivatives sectors, this left the
big trading firms struggling to get their dealing books in balance for the
end of the trading account. Although nerves had clearly steadied, London's
nervousness in the face of an uncertain opening in New York underlined the
new, and less confident, mood in the marketplace.

FT  26 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada wins LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Granada had won control over television station LWT after a
hard-fought battle refocused attention on television stocks yesterday.
Once leading LWT shareholder Mercury Asset Management had accepted the offer
for its 14.2 per cent stake on Thursday, it was expected that Granada would
win. But the leisure group will now be issuing 112m new shares to fulfil its
13-for-10 share offer. If some of the big LWT stakeholders - particularly
the LWT management which has 10 per cent - decide to cash in the new shares
there will be a big overhang of Granada stock in the market. Granada shares
ticked off 3 after the announcement but closed a penny up at 561p. LWT ended
5 higher 731p.
The denouement of the bid removes the last leading aggressor within the
sector. Consequently, bid hopes that had surrounded Yorkshire Tyne Tees and
Scottish receded. Yorkshire fell 16 to 327p, although Hoare Govett is
believed to be preparing a buy note arguing that the stock is cheap at this
level. Scottish dropped 23 to 551p.
Carlton Communications bounced 28 1/2 to 945 1/2 p after recent
underperformance. The shares were lifted by news that Disney is to release
the film Snow White on video; Carlton produces all Disney's videos. Several
analysts were also said to be preparing positive recommendations.
Bioscience group Zeneca, which is expected to show profits of around Pounds
645m on Thursday, fell 3 to 752p.
In spite of expectations of a healthy increase in full-year profits on
Monday, Hong Kong bank HSBC fell 3 to 938p, the shares reacting to the
latest slide in the Hong Kong market. Among other Hong Kong related stocks,
Standard Chartered recovered from earlier weakness to close 3 ahead at 1227p
but Cable &amp; Wireless slipped 10 to 459p.
British Gas was the most heavily traded stock in London for the second day
running. Consideration of Thursday's figures fuelled concern over the
company's ability to maintain real dividend growth.
NatWest Securities advised clients to maintain neutral to underweight
positions while Merrill Lynch lowered its rating to short-term neutral from
above average. The shares fell 10 to 318p on turnover of 14m.
Royal Insurance showed a delayed reaction to a higher than anticipated
dividend. Unable to respond on Thursday because of sharp falls in the market
the stock bounced 14 to 292p yesterday. BZW and SGST reiterated buy
recommendations.
Elsewhere in the sector, Commercial Union improved 27 to 630p after
Wednesday's big profit increase. Sun Alliance rose 10 to 349p, but General
Accident eased 8 to 629p ahead of figures on Tuesday. It is expected to show
a profit of Pounds 270m to Pounds 285m compared with a loss of Pounds 29.3m
last time.
The sector was unsettled by comments from Guardian Royal Exchange on Tuesday
that insurance premiums appeared to be softening. GRE recovered 5 to 213p.
A broker's report that gloom surrounding the Scotch whisky industry may soon
lift added to a strong showing in the drinks sector. Grand Metropolitan,
which said sales of its J&amp;B brand were up 3 per cent year-on-year, jumped 14
to 471p. Guinness gained 9 to 523p and Allied Lyons 10 to 615p. The report
by Sutherland &amp; Partners forecast 'a modest recovery' for the UK industry
this year after four years of decline.
A big bounce in Forte was put down to a technical situation by dealers. 'A
big buyer has shorted the market,' said one, adding that the shares had
recently fallen and looked oversold. The shares climbed 12 to 259p with
turnover hitting 3.2m.
Regional hotelier Stakis added 2 to 86p after falling behind recently. The
management were also involved in presentations around the City.
Buying - and spurious talk of a possible takeover - receded in Carrs Milling
and the shares slipped 9 to 208p. The stock had been bid up after Northern
Foods sold its near 5 per cent stake in the pet food and bakery group
earlier in the week. Hazlewood Foods gained 2 to 155p following an analysts'
visit.
Engineering group Siebe continued to sparkle and the shares gained another
11 to 605p, on hopes of a bullish presentation at SG Warburg on Friday.
Materials group Cookson were in demand ahead of next week's results and the
shares moved 6 ahead to 269p. Inchcape put on 4 to 555p with Robert Fleming
said to be positive.
Property leaders bounced following their recent weakness. British Land
gained 5 to 433p after this week's purchase of a 30 per cent stake in
developer Stanhope, off a penny at 40p. Land Securities rose 7 to 716p and
MEPC 9 to 495p.
The decision by building societies to either raise fixed mortgage rates or
suspend some fixed mortgages altogether added to the interest rate
uneasiness among housebuilders. Banner Homes shed 8 to 156p, Barratt 8 to
266p and Bryant 3 to 177p.
Good results on Thursday helped Provident Financial shares to a rise of 23
to 522p.

FT  26 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Malaysian worries hit stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over the implications of the simmering row with Kuala Lumpur hit the
share prices of several UK companies with Malaysian trade links.
Electrical and electronic stocks were the most severely affected. BICC fell
14 to 436p and GEC 5 1/2 to 319p with analysts worrying less about existing
contracts than the threat to future work.
But the phrase 'a storm in a teacup' was used more than once, as analysts
pointed out that Far East contracts were small as a proportion of the
companies' total sales. BICC was also hit by a downgrade from Credit
Lyonnais.
North West Water, part of a consortium for the privatisation of Malaysia's
waste water system, ended down 6 at 547p. However, the company said the
contract would not be affected by the furore.
In construction, John Laing fell 13 to 385p, but other stocks were quiet.
'Worries over Malaysia are four parts sentiment and one part reality,' said
one analyst.
But Rolls-Royce was undermined by the nervous sentiment, the shares trailing
5 at 168p. The Malaysian government has an order for 24 Hawk aircraft which
are to be powered by Rolls engines, though analysts said it is unlikely to
cancel the deal. The aircraft are manufactured by British Aerospace whose
shares finished 3 ahead at 505p, after recent falls.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday continued its recent decline in foreign exchange
markets as weakness in US stocks and bonds put pressure on the currency,
writes Philip Gawith.
Renewed market fears of a stronger yen are also weighing on the dollar, as
are worries that German interest rates may not fall as quickly as originally
thought.
The weakness of the US currency is puzzling analysts. It comes against the
background of financial markets made nervous by fears of a further
tightening in US rates - which should be positive for the dollar.
The meeting today of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors in
Frankfurt had a dampening effect on trading activity. Some investors were
nervous of taking positions ahead of the summit for fear that post-summit
statements might cause sharp fluctuations in rates.
The dollar closed two and a half pfennigs lower in London at DM1.7055 from
DM1.7306 on Thursday. It finished a cent lower compared to sterling at
Dollars 1.4904, from Dollars 1.4796, and also dropped against the yen to
Y104.725 from Y105.350.
Until recently there was a fairly broad consensus behind a stronger dollar.
Now this view is being called into question.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, comments: 'The consensus was
tested in equity and bonds in the past few days. It may well be that the
next stage in the game is to test the consensus of a rising dollar.'
By contrast to the beleaguered dollar, the D-Mark was stronger against most
EMS currencies. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank,
said: 'The D-Mark's status as a safe haven currency seems to have re-emerged
in this climate of uncertainty.'
Analysts said the German currency had gained support from speculation that
the January M3 figure, to be released this week or next, could be as high as
13 per cent.
Others argue that an easing of policy in Germany is required to reduce
pressure in bond markets, where rates rose sharply last week. 'The
Bundesbank had better cut the repo rate pretty soon in order to burst the
bubble otherwise things could get quite serious,' said Mr Tony Norfield, UK
treasury economist at ABN-AMRO.
The scope and pace of monetary easing in Europe is likely to be discussed at
the G7 meeting today.
The Belgian franc was quoted yesterday evening at 20.585/595 to the D-Mark,
barely changed from Thursday's late 20.58/59 after the Belgian central bank
cut its key central rate 15 basis points to 6.40 per cent.
Sterling fell by nearly two pfennigs to finish in London at DM2.5418 from
DM2.5605 on Thursday. Sentiment towards the UK currency soured on news that
Malaysia had decided to impose trade sanctions against Britain. The downward
revision by the CBI of its growth forecasts for 1994 and 1995 also had an
impact.
The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with around Pounds 60m of
late assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.574bn. The
revised forecast of the liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.55bn, slightly
higher than the initial forecast of Pounds 1.5bn.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium hungry for more
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange's aluminium market marked time this week as it
assessed progress so far with the policy of multilateral production cuts and
awaited next week's meeting of producing countries in Ottawa, at which the
policy will be reviewed and, so traders hope, confirmed.
The 12 per cent rally in prices since the policy was agreed last month in
Brussels was more or less maintained, with the LME's three months delivery
price closing yesterday at Dollars 1,314.50 a tonne, down Dollars 7 on the
week. But it continued to appear somewhat fragile as prices tended to slide
back on days when no further cuts were announced.
An Dollars 18 fall on Monday was partially recouped the next day following
news that a 39,000-tonnes-a-year cut was planned at Australia's Tomago
smelter. But that rally was wiped out on Wednesday and the price dipped to
Dollars 1,290 a tonne before the announcement by Pechiney of France on
Thursday that it was cutting output by 120,000 tonnes, rather more than
expected, lifted it to Dollars 1,314.50.
The list of planned production cuts grew further yesterday with
announcements from Alusaf of South Africa (4,000 tonnes), Kaiser of the US
(40,000 tonnes) and Suriname Aluminium Company, an Alcoa subsidiary, (3,000
tonnes). These took the western total so far close to 850,000 tonnes, well
on the way to the target of 1.5m tonnes set at last month's meeting.
However, some analysts doubt that the target can be reached without
contributions from countries not represented at the Brussels talks, which
include Brazil and the Gulf producers.
There is also some scepticism about the Russian authorities' ability to
persuade its smelters to deliver the production cuts promised in Brussels -
200,000 tonnes by April and another 300,000 in the next three months. A
senior official of the Aluminiy producers' group said on Tuesday that no
additions to the 100,000 tonnes of cuts already announced would be made
until it was satisfied that western producers were keeping to their end of
the bargain. That, however, was before the announcement by Pechiney, whose
earlier silence on its cutback plans had been cited by the official as 'an
exact example of what we are displeased with'.
Other LME contracts also ended lower. Three months copper see-sawed to
Dollars 1,887.50 a tonne, down Dollars 19 on the week, while lead's price
ended Dollars 10 off at Dollars 488.50 a tonne and zinc's Dollars 21 off at
Dollars 973.50 a tonne.
The big loser among the precious metals was platinum, which saw its premium
over gold narrow from Dollars 20.50 to Dollars 12.90 as it fell Dollars 7.40
to Dollars 391.60 a troy ounce. Traders attributed the metal's weaker tone
to reduced concern about the possibility of production being disrupted in
the run-up to South Africa's April elections.
The London Commodity Exchange's cocoa market began quite strongly in
response to last Friday's late surge in New York. But gains were trimmed
later in the week and the May futures position ended at Dollars 924 a tonne,
up Dollars 5 on balance.
News that the new, price stabilising International Cocoa Agreement had come
into effect on Tuesday (although consumer signings were below requirements)
came as no surprise and had little effect on Sentiment. Neither did the ICCO
secretariat's forecast that this year's expected world production deficit of
110,000 tonnes, which would be the third in succession, would be followed by
three more, totalling 375,000 tonnes.

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Deficit at Woolworth drives down
share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Woolworth, the US retailer, tumbled Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 21 in
early trading yesterday - a fall of 9 per cent - on news of a sharp reversal
into losses in the fourth quarter to January 29. But they rallied to close
at Dollars 22 1/2 for a net loss of  3/8 on the day.
Net income of Dollars 165m the previous year turned into net losses of
Dollars 46m, on revenues down from Dollars 3.13bn to Dollars 2.82bn.
Earnings per share of Dollars 1.26 turned into losses per share of 35 cents.
Woolworth, which has been shedding its general merchandise stores and
building up its specialty retailing businesses, stressed the results
included a pre-tax charge of Dollars 168m. This was associated with the sale
of its chain of 120 Woolco superstores in Canada to Wal-Mart, the US stores
group, announced last month.
The original announcement forecast that the charge would be just Dollars
45m, mainly resulting from the recognition of currency exchange losses.
Yesterday, Woolworth said additional costs had arisen from inventory
markdowns, the sale of some stores not included in the Wal-Mart deal, and an
unexpected delay in completing the transaction.
However, it said it benefited from a pre-tax credit of Dollars 145m relating
to the reversal of some charges taken last quarter - biggest component of
the overall downturn, therefore, came from its trading activities.
Operating profits of Dollars 286m last time turned into operating losses of
Dollars 21m. Woolworth said its operations in the fourth quarter were hit by
disappointing sales and heavy promotional activity.
Full-year turnover fell to Dollars 9.62bn from Dollars 9.96bn. Net income of
Dollars 280m slid into net losses of Dollars 495m, and earnings per share of
Dollars 2.14 turned into losses per share of Dollars 3.76.

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Toyota forced into ban on
overtime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, Japan's biggest automotive manufacturer, has introduced its first
overtime ban for assembly-line workers.
The move underlines the extent of the recession affecting the industry, and
its difficulty in exporting, given the continuing strength of the yen.
The group stopped all overtime for production and office-workers at its
Japanese plants during January and February. It has not yet decided whether
to continue the ban during March.
The company, which reported a 48.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits during
the six months to the end of December, has also temporarily shut one of its
17 domestic production lines because of poor demand.
The shutdown, at its Motomachi plant in Toyota City, Aichi prefecture,
happened late last year. The group intends to reopen the line, which makes
mark II passenger cars, in April.
Another line, at the Tahara plant in Aichi prefecture, had also been closed.
The company has not yet decided when the line, making Celica and Carina EDs,
will be reopened.
Toyota said its daily production had fallen from a peak of about 17,000
vehicles a day to 13,000. Japanese vehicle production fell 10.2 per cent
last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
(Jama).
The Japanese automotive industry is gaining little comfort from exports. In
January, these recorded their 10th straight month of year-on-year decline.
Exports slumped 26.5 per cent compared with the same month in 1993,
according to Jama. January exports of cars, trucks and buses fell to 390,418
from 531,349 in January 1993.

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: News Corp share inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The News Corp preference share saga moved on yesterday when the
International Securities Market Association (Isma), the Eurobond market's
trade association, said it was investigating the matter with the Amsterdam,
Frankfurt and Luxembourg stock exchanges, on which the shares are listed.
The dispute between News Corp, the media, film and publishing group
controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, and the bondholders erupted earlier this
month when News Corp said they were not entitled to around Pounds 15m
(Dollars 21.9m) worth of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china
manufacturer demerged last year from Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
The decision contradicted a notice issued by News Corp in December which
said that holders of its preference shares, exchangeable for shares which
News Corp held in Pearson, would also get Royal Doulton shares when
exercising their exchange right.
Isma said the events gave rise to serious investor protection issues.
They also raised the question as to whether the standards expected of
borrowers accessing the international securities market had been properly
met.

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sales surge helps lift Astra 53%
to SKr7.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Astra lifted pre-tax profits by 53 per cent to SKr7.8bn (Dollars 975m) in
1993, maintaining its momentum as one of the world's fastest-growing
pharmaceutical groups.
The performance was powered by surging sales of the group's two main drugs,
Losec and Pulmicort, and the weaker krona.
The dividend was raised 60 per cent to SKr1.60 per share. The Swedish group
is to establish an American depositary receipt (ADR) programme in the US
from the autumn.
Sales climbed 45 per cent to SKr22.6bn. Excluding currency factors, the
increase was 21 per cent, well ahead of the market's 5 per cent growth.
The group said earnings would again develop favourably in 1994, as sales
continued to outperform the market. However, it warned that the pace of the
increase would slow, because it would not derive the same currency benefits
this year.
In the fourth quarter, pre-tax profits climbed 20 per cent, to SKr2.04bn, on
sales of SKr6.5bn, up 50 per cent. The rate of profits increase slowed
because of big currency gains in the final quarter of 1992.
Sales of Losec, an anti-peptic ulcer agent, surged 64 per cent to SKr7.11bn,
while overall sales of the drug, including through licensees, were up 76 per
cent at SKr12.7bn.
Losec is now reckoned by Astra to be fifth biggest selling drug worldwide,
with a market share of more than 30 per cent in Europe, 14 per cent in the
US and and between 5 and 6 per cent in Japan.
Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent with between 35 and 40 per cent of the
European market, saw sales rise 56 per cent to SKr2.96bn.
Astra has emerged relatively unscathed from government clampdowns on
healthcare spending. However, local currency sales in Germany, its biggest
market, fell 3 per cent last year, compared with a market decline of 10 per
cent. Sales growth of 48 per cent in the UK and 52 per cent in France helped
to compensate for this.
Total group sales, excluding currencies, were up 25 per cent in Europe and
20 per cent in the US, compared with market growth of 2 and 4 per cent
respectively.

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Watchmaker's car silences the
sceptics - SMH chairman Nicolas Hayek talks to Ian Rodger about the
Swatchmobile project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The very idea that a producer of watches could break into the tough and
expensive world motor industry is odd, to say the least.
But that is exactly what SMH, the Swiss watchmaking group, known best for
its cheap and cheerful Swatches, is poised to do with an
environmentally-friendly small car.
Even though Mr Nicolas Hayek, the group's irrepressible chairman, was a
successful engineering consultant to the motor industry before rescuing SMH,
his plans have always aroused more than a little scepticism.
The Zurich-based Mr Hayek has long been aware of this, but has gone on
immodestly tantalising the world for four years on the near-revolutionary
merits of his so-called Swatchmobile. Consumers would love it, and other
carmakers would be stunned by its wonderful design features, he would tell
all comers.
However, the car never seemed to materialise. Mr Hayek initially claimed he
did not want to show it to competitors any sooner than necessary, but that
just provoked enterprising photographic journalists to spy on the company
and produce intriguing pictures.
A planned prototype unveiling in 1992 was cancelled. Then a mooted joint
venture with Volkswagen collapsed last year.
Uncharitable observers began to wonder if the Swatchmobile was simply a
stock market car, designed to put some zip into SMH shares whenever they
sagged.
This week, however, all doubts disappeared. SMH and no less a player than
Mercedes-Benz of Germany announced they were setting up a joint venture to
produce the Swatchmobile. If all goes well - and that means getting approval
from various boards and advisers at Mercedes - the car will finally be
unveiled to a curious world at the end of next week.
Already, Mr Hayek has clarified the broad outlines of the vehicle. It will
be a two-seater - 'enough for two people and two cases of mineral water' -
and will probably be on the market in three years, selling for about Dollars
10,000. '(That amount) is on the high side,' he says.
There has been much speculation about its engine design. Mr Hayek says three
different systems are being assessed. The aim is to produce a car that is
not just a city runabout that has to be plugged in every few hours, but also
a vehicle you would drive from Zurich to Sicily in the same comfort you
would expect in a normal car, he says.
Fine, but with virtually every important car manufacturer working hard on
environmentally-friendly designs, what do SMH and Swatch bring to the party?
Answer: they apply the same approach to carmaking and selling that led to
the phenomenal success of Swatches. These are:
Simplify and automate production to reduce cost and, often, as a by-product
of that process, improve quality. That was Mr Hayek's strategy for beating
Japanese competitors in the mass watch market, and it has worked
spectacularly.
'Cars have become much too expensive. They can be made much more cheaply,'
he says. 'We know we can produce high quality at low cost.' Set prices low.
'The idea behind Swatch is to have no target market. Everyone should buy
them, from age six to 120.'
The product should be sold throughout the world. While watches can be
exported quickly and efficiently from SMH's Swiss factories, Mr Hayek
envisions Swatchmobiles will be manufactured in several countries, 'and that
does not exclude Great Britain'. Once the deal with Mercedes is sealed, he
plans quickly to take up an invitation to visit Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of the UK Board of Trade.
The product should be 'provocative', expressing 'joy in life'. 'A Rolls
Royce or a Jaguar is not just a car, it is a car plus something,' he says.
It all sounds a tall order for the Swatchmobile, but it looks as if it will
finally be fulfilled. Mr Hayek says SMH and Mercedes have been working on
the joint venture for a year, and have resolved a lot of the problems that
brought the discussions with Volkswagen to grief.
The concept has been approved throughout the Mercedes organisation. 'A lot
of detail work has been done,' he says.
Mercedes will have majority control, but SMH, with 49 per cent, will have a
veto on many issues, according to Mr Hayek. He claims the project is also
well within SMH's means, so far taking up no more than between 15 and 20 per
cent of the group's cashflow.
'And if it is as successful as we hope, we will keep on investing.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fall in demand batters profits
at Bridgestone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bridgestone, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, yesterday reported a 53
per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y37.3bn (Dollars 354m)
last year from Y79.5bn in 1992. Group sales for the year tumbled 8.4 per
cent, from Y1,745bn to Y1,599bn over the same period.
The company is struggling with a collapse in demand in its domestic market,
where it controls about 45 per cent of the car tyre sector. Bridgestone said
demand from car manufacturers had fallen because of the poor state of the
economy and increased imports.
The replacement market had also declined, it added. Domestic prices have
been under pressure, and the group's product mix deteriorated as Japanese
consumers increasingly traded down. Non-consolidated domestic sales fell
13.6 per cent from Y543bn to Y470bn.
The strength of the yen has prevented Bridgestone's domestic operations
exporting their way out of trouble. Mr Isao Imaizumi, managing director,
said the average dollar exchange rate in 1993 was Y112, up Y15 on the
previous year.
Non-consolidated exports fell 11.5 per cent, from Y181bn to Y160bn.
Bridgestone said unit sales to Europe had fallen, but had increased to North
America, Asia and Oceania.
Consolidated tyre sales fell from Y1,324bn last year, to Y1,191bn - the same
as in 1988 - while turnover at the non-tyre operations fell from Y421bn to
Y407bn.
Cost-cutting saved Y20bn, but consolidated operating profits nevertheless
fell 22.8 per cent to Y93.2bn from Y120.6bn.
Consolidated net earnings after tax dropped from Y28.4bn to Y28.38bn, while
earnings per share fell from Y36.79 to Y36.77.
The group forecast consolidated sales would reach Y1,570bn this year, and
that net earnings would rise to Y30bn. It predicted earnings per share would
be Y38.86.
The company dropped an extraordinary dividend of Y2.5 per share paid last
year, declaring a dividend of Y12 per share.

Rogers Communications' CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.1bn) bid for Maclean
Hunter, the Canadian publishing and cable-TV group, is mired in uncertainty
after several surprise developments.
These events, including the 7 per cent cut in US cable-TV rates imposed by
the Federal Communications Commission this week, have cast doubt both on
Rogers' willingness to stick with its CDollars 17-per-share offer, and on
MH's ability to find a better alternative.
The uncertainty is reflected in a steep fall in MH's share price over the
past two days. The Toronto-based publishing and cable-TV group was trading
at CDollars 15.50 yesterday morning, well below Rogers' offer of CDollars 17
per share. The offer is open until March 15.
Mr Ted Rogers, Rogers' chief executive, was reported yesterday to have said
his offer may be 'too generous'.
Analysts said the cut in US cable rates, as well as the subsequent collapse
of merger talks between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc, had
significantly lowered the value of MH's extensive US cable franchises.
Rogers plans to dispose of these assets if its bid for MH succeeds. It will
also distribute a portion of proceeds above CDollars 1.5bn to MH
shareholders. However, it has the right to rescind its offer if any material
change occurs in MH's business. MH has separately been seeking a buyer for
the US cable assets as part of a promise to maximise shareholder value.
It has so far spurned Rogers' overtures. However, its efforts to put more
money into shareholders' pockets suffered a setback this week when Canada's
finance minister closed a tax loophole which might have allowed MH to
distribute proceeds from the sale of assets to its shareholders tax-free.
Outsiders are sharply divided on the likely outcome of the battle.
A Toronto portfolio manager said yesterday this week's developments had
markedly reduced MH's value. 'The reality is that the world has changed,' he
said.

<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland, Europe's most highly-valued bank, has posted a
heavy 68.9 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net income, to SFr2.27bn
(Dollars 1.6bn). It attributes the surge to booming securities markets and a
big inflow of investment funds.
The directors are proposing a 10.3 per cent rise in dividends, plus the
right to buy one new bearer or registered share at par for every 100 held.
Mr Robert Studer, chief executive, said he did not expect this year's profit
before bad debt provisions and taxes to equal the SFr5.27bn made in 1993.
However, net income could be higher, if provision requirements declined, as
expected, from the extraordinarily high levels of the past three years.
UBS bearer shares fell SFr38 to SFr1,413 in Zurich following the results,
which were at the low end of market expectations. However, the group was
still valued at SFr37bn, well above the SFr32.3bn of Deutsche Bank, the
former European leader by market capitalisation.
Income trends seen at the interim stage continued, with trading in
securities and currencies showing by far the greatest growth, 73.5 per cent,
to SFr2.9bn.
Income from services gained 27.8 per cent to SFr4.04bn. Among the services,
income from investment counselling and asset management was up 30 per cent
to SFr3.2bn.
Net interest income was up only 6.2 per cent to SFr3.6bn. Customer loans
grew only 4.3 per cent, as more turned to the capital markets for their
needs.
Operating expenses jumped 19.1 per cent, to SFr5.7bn, mainly because of
performance-related pay and early retirement schemes. Provisions for bad
loans advanced 22 per cent, to SFr2.2bn, mainly due to the recession in
Switzerland.
Total assets at the end of 1993 stood at SFr311.3bn, up a brisk 16.7 per
cent. This was attributed to a 118 per cent jump in the securities trading
portfolio, to SFr50bn.
Capital and reserves totalled SFr21.7bn. After dividend payments, the BIS
capital ratio will be 10.2 per cent. Return on equity was 11.5 per cent,
above the group's mid-1990s target of 10 per cent.

fall

<TEXT>
Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, succeeded in limiting the decline in 1993
net profit before extraordinary items to 2.7 per cent, thanks to a stronger
fourth quarter and better results in the US.
The company, which yesterday changed its name to Akzo Nobel to reflect its
recent takeover of Nobel of Sweden, said net profit before extraordinary
items fell to Fl 693m (Dollars 355m) from Fl 712m a year earlier.
If extraordinary charges for restructuring and for book losses on
divestments are included in both years, net profit fell by 15 per cent to Fl
549m. Group sales were down slightly at Fl 16.5bn, compared with Fl 16.7bn.
The improvement in fourth-quarter net profit before extraordinary items, to
Fl 173m from Fl 127m a year earlier, compares with declines in the first two
quarters, and barely changed results in the third.
Akzo, which is to leave its 1993 dividend unchanged at Fl 6.50, said the
recession in Europe appeared to have bottomed out, and it predicted a
positive trend for the company in 1994.
Pharmaceuticals put in the best performance of Akzo's four main businesses.
The sector generated around 55 per cent of Akzo's 1993 operating profit,
even though it accounted for only about 20 per cent of turnover.
The chemicals and coatings sectors turned in roughly similar results, while
Akzo's fibre business posted an operating loss of Fl 21m, compared with a
profit of Fl 127m the year before.
The deterioration was blamed on difficult conditions in the European car and
textile industries.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Southwestern Bell, the aggressive US telecommunications group, yesterday
announced a Dollars 680m deal to expand its wireless telephone operations in
six new markets in the north-east and California.
The San Antonio, Texas-based company, one of the seven US Baby Bell regional
telephone groups, agreed to acquire the domestic cellular operations of
Associated Communications, based in Pittsburgh.
The sale includes majority shares in systems in four markets in New York
state, as well as minority interests in businesses serving Pittsburgh and
the San Francisco area.
The transaction involves the transfer of stock to Associated shareholders
and the assumption of Dollars 123m in Associated debt by Southwestern.
The acquisition is part of Southwestern Bell's strategy of challenging
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph for leadership in the booming US market for
wireless communications. AT&amp;T underlined the potential of the industry with
its Dollars 12.3bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications last year.
Southwestern Bell is the one of the world's fastest growing companies in the
industry. In the fourth quarter of last year, it added 272,000 cellular
customers for a total of 2m. The group has acquired wireless systems in
Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington DC and three other New York markets,
adding to networks in its traditional operating area in the south-western
US.
The move into other areas of the country puts Southwestern into direct
competition with rival Baby Bells, including Nynex, based in New York.
The company declined to comment on the number of customers served by the
Associated systems, which cover regions with a total population of 3.2m.
Southwestern leads all North American cellular providers with a 5.7 per cent
penetration of the markets it serves.
The deal is structured as a tax-free merger. To facilitate the transaction,
Associated will spin off a subsidiary, which will own all of its other
assets.
The agreement, subject to approval of federal and state regulators and
shareholders, is expected to be completed by late 1994.

<TEXT>
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive of Metallgesellschaft,
has denounced the company's supervisory board chairman for an 'orchestrated
attack on my credibility' at the metals, mining and industrial group's
special meeting on Thursday.
Mr Schimmelbusch, who was sacked in December last year, told a newspaper
that Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is supervisory board
chairman at the German metals group, should have known the risks associated
with the oil futures trading activities of MG Corp, the New York-based
trading subsidiary.
Speculative futures dealing at MG Corp led to losses of DM2.3bn (Dollars
1.35bn), and drove Metallgesellschaft to the brink of insolvency.
On Thursday, Mr Schmitz blamed the company's near-failure on the former
management, claiming he had been wilfully misled by Mr Schimmelbusch and
other directors.
Mr Schimmelbusch, who is believed to have been living chiefly in New York
since he was dismissed, said he had frequently discussed MG Corp's oil
futures trading activities with Mr Schmitz during 1992 and 1993.
He said the dialogue was partly in the context of a joint venture between
Deutsche Bank and Metallgesellschaft, in which the bank tried to market an
oil derivatives programme to its German industrial customers.
The aim of the programme was to reduce companies' energy costs, but joint
presentations by the bank and Metallgesellschaft did not produce any
business. The dialogue with the supervisory board chairman went further than
this, Mr Schimmelbusch said, covering MG Corp's strategy and financing
needs.
Mr Schmitz said on Thursday he was not properly informed of problems at MG
Corp until December 3 last year. Mr Schimmelbusch claimed he had not known
about a mismatch between commitments to deliver oil and the hedging strategy
 -the eventual cause of MG Corp's massive losses - until November 29. He had
then thought the potential loss would be limited to Dollars 200m.
Deutsche Bank yesterday refused to comment on Mr Schimmelbusch's attack.
Shareholders at the meeting, meanwhile, voted overwhelmingly for a DM3.4bn
refinancing package.

North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and exploration group,
yesterday reported a sharp rise in after-tax profit in the six months to the
end of December. The result was ADollars 86.4m (USDollars 63m), compared
with ADollars 52.3m in the same period of 1992/93, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney.
However, it warned that lower profits were expected in the second half
because there would be no contribution from the paper manufacturing and
distribution business sold to Amcor in November. Lower iron ore prices
negotiated with the Japanese steel mills would also affect the result.
These factors would be partly offset by improved contributions from gold
mining and the 66 per cent-owned Energy Resources of Australia.

shake-out

<TEXT>
The recent plunge in global bond markets has investors wondering if this is
the end of the European bond rally. However, most economists still feel that
once the upheaval is over, European bond yields can fall further as
short-term interest rates are cut and inflation falls.
'Investors with a horizon longer than a few weeks should stick with the
economic fundamentals, which point to a sustained rally,' said Mr Julian
Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets in London.
Although Europe lags the US economic cycle, the recent US monetary
tightening fuelled fears that the pace of monetary easing in Europe would
slow, and short-term rates in some countries could rise.
The UK market was especially rattled by calls for monetary tightening from
Mr Nick Knight, global investment strategist at Nomura, who has, until
recently, had a reputation as a superbull. He warned that UK short-term
interest rates might have to go up to 6 or 7 per cent by the year-end to
defend sterling against the impact of poor trade figures.
Others, however, feel there is little fundamental justification for the bond
markets' sell-off, arguing that the slide was due to heavy selling by
highly-leveraged investors, including US hedge funds, who had to liquidate
bond positions after incurring huge losses in other markets.
'At the end of last year, a lot of funds flowed into these markets, and this
is a very serious correction of that rally,' said Mr Klaus Baader, European
economist at Lehman Brothers in London. 'The European economies won't stage
a recovery this year. Inflation is heading down, rates are heading down . .
. this all favours European bond markets.'
However, some say bond yields are unlikely to return to their recent lows.
One of them is Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of BHF-Bank in Frankfurt,
who feels a turning point has been reached.
'The clear trend of the market has gone,' he said. 'Investment horizons will
become much more short-term than was the case last year, and the
opportunities for making profits will come from taking advantage of market
volatility.'
Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysts IDEA, takes a
similarly cautious view. 'After this week's carnage, the psychological
impact on investors has been so great we don't expect them to return to the
market with any conviction,' he said. 'I think a return to the lows we have
seen will be very difficult. The post sell-off rallies will generally be
disappointing.'
Still, many expect Europe's bond markets to recover when the Bundesbank
resumes its easing course, and elections in Germany and elsewhere are out of
the way.
'We still look for German 10-year yields to test the 5.5 per cent level
after the German election,' says Mr Julian Callow, international economist
at Kleinwort Benson.
With 10-year gilt yields around 7.10 per cent, Mr Callow also expects the UK
bond market to stabilise soon. 'As in Germany, domestic investors are likely
to be attracted by yields in excess of 7 per cent while inflation remains
subdued.'
Meanwhile, US bonds should start stabilising around current levels, predicts
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg.
'We have long looked for the (long bond yield to) spike to 6.5 per cent to
6.75 per cent and, now here, feel the market has done most of the dirty work
 -though a spike to 7 per cent remains distinctly possible.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BAe answers criticism of BMW/Rover deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace tried 'for months' to reach agreement with Honda on a
reorganisation of Rover Group, BAe shareholders have been told in a letter
setting out the details of its intended sale of Rover to BMW of Germany.
Asking them to approve the sale at an extraordinary meeting to take place on
March 15, Mr John Cahill, outgoing BAe chairman, counters criticism of what
has been described as a 'betrayal' of Honda's 15-year partnership with
Rover.
For BAe to have gone along with Honda's proposals for restructuring would
have required it to provide continued 'substantial' financial support for
Rover while remaining as a large minority shareholder, Mr Cahill says in his
letter.
Honda wanted each to hold a stake of 47.5 per cent, with the remaining 5 per
cent allocated to Rover's employees.
Under the terms of the sale, BMW will buy the entire issued share capital of
Rover and Rover USA, which controls Rover's sales activities in North
America, for Pounds 800m cash.
Of the sale price, Pounds 560m will be payable on completion of the deal,
with the balance of Pounds 240m payable on June 30, plus interest from the
initial completion date.
In addition, BMW is assuming Rover Group borrowings of about Pounds 200m and
responsibility for further off-balance sheet funding of some Pounds 700m.
Although the sale will generate much-needed cash for BAe, it will also put
the group in breach of its own borrowings limits unless shareholders approve
further changes on March 15.
Its articles of association currently restrict borrowings to a maximum of
150 per cent of adjusted capital and reserves. Since the sale will reduce
shareholders' funds by nearly Pounds 500m, this limit will be breached once
the sale is completed. Shareholders will be asked to raise the borrowing
ceiling to 250 per cent.

Turnover was lower at Pounds 7.27m, against Pounds 9.79m.
The result was after writing down its stock of developments by a further

Pounds 2.07m through the settlement of two court actions.
The shares were suspended in June; talks with a private company have been

<TEXT>
North of England Building Society yesterday announced a fall from Pounds
16.7m to Pounds 13.5m in pre-tax profits for the 1993 year.
The decline was against the trend of recent announcements in the sector
which have shown significantly increased profits.
The 19 per cent fall, struck after an exceptional profit of Pounds 1m from
the sale of its Sunderland headquarters, was due mainly to increased
provisions, totalling Pounds 2.58m, for mortgage losses and the need to
compensate customers of its independent financial advice service who
suffered as a result of mis-selling.
Gross mortgage advances fell to Pounds 168.4m (Pounds 288.5m). There were
reductions in net interest receivable at Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 26.7m) and
other income and charges at Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.37m). Total assets rose to
Pounds 1.51bn (Pounds 1.42bn).

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: When loyalty loses to commercial strategy -
David Wighton on LWT's fight to avoid becoming part of the Granada Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Their Pounds 50m worth of shares may provide a little consolation, but there
was no disguising the disappointment of LWT's directors yesterday.
They felt badly let down. Shareholders had sold out to Granada rather than
stick with the team that had delivered them such sparkling returns over the
past four years.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, did not conceal his feelings about Mercury
Asset Management, LWT's largest shareholder, which accepted Granada's offer
on Thursday.
'We have performed outstandingly well, particularly for MAM, and I think we
were entitled to their support when we needed it.'
Some observers have seen MAM's decision as another example of the ruthless,
short-termism of some institutional investors. 'I can't remember when a
management with such a good record was not backed in a hostile bid,' said
one analyst yesterday. 'If the LWT team doesn't deserve loyalty nobody
does.'
But institutions that accepted the bid dismissed such arguments. One said:
'We have a high opinion of LWT's management, but then we do of Granada's
too. In the end it came down to commercial strategy, and, of course, price.'
For many institutions the debate over price was finely balanced, but in
terms of commercial strategy LWT's defence had a serious flaw. 'The defence
was that LWT had a rosy future as an independent company, but that was
inconsistent with management actions,' said one institution.
Most observers agree with Granada's charge that LWT's defence had been
strong on presentation - with Sir Christopher and his chief executive, Mr
Greg Dyke, proving a very effective double act - but weak on content.
'You kept on thinking they must have a rabbit to pull out of the hat. But
they hadn't, or if they had it died,' said one analyst.
Plans for a link with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Anglia came unravelled almost
immediately. The more promising talks with US West, which expressed interest
in taking a 29.9 per cent stake in LWT, were cut short when the Takeover
Panel refused to allow the US telephone giant to make a formal approach.
Hopes that LWT would be saved by a referral to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers
Commission were also quickly dashed. The takeover clock was stopped for a
week while the Office of Fair Trading considered the concentration of
advertising market share following a successful bid. But the clock restarted
after Granada undertook to limit its share of UK television net advertising
revenue to 25 per cent by August 31 1995.
That left LWT's defence relying largely on its 1993 profits forecast,
showing a 43 per cent increase on the previous year.
Granada, attempted to cast doubt on the figures - making claims it was
subsequently forced to retract by the Takeover Panel - but the much better
than expected forecast meant it had little chance of success without raising
its bid. It tried to secure a recommendation for an increased offer. But Sir
Christopher turned down the 8 per cent improvement in the paper terms.
'I think if there had been an eight on the front it would have been agreed,'
said one institution. 'But in the end you wonder whether it became a
personality issue.'
Sir Christopher yesterday insisted that there had been no acrimony and
congratulated Granada on its fine judgment. 'Their decision not to go for a
recommendation was vindicated. They would have had to pay more. As it is
they have got a great company at what I am sure will prove to be a great
price.'
Some analysts have questioned whether Granada was right not to pay that bit
more for a recommendation. 'LWT is a people business with some very good
managers who Granada needs. They have taken a big risk by not getting
agreement.'
However, some in the Granada camp dismiss the idea that most of the top
executives will leave. 'I think Gerry Robinson is too smart to let them go.
If the top people walk out he will have a problem.'
Sir Christopher, who is also chairman of Life Sciences, the quoted
laboratory equipment group, has known from the start that there would be no
room for him in the enlarged Granada group.
Of his future he will only say: 'We will see. There is a large pile of
unopened letters on my desk.' One colleague said yesterday: 'I would be
surprised if he is not chairman of a Footsie company within the next three
months.'

An exceptional credit of Pounds 1.49m, arising from restructuring, helped
CCS Group report pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.53m in the year to October 31,
against losses of Pounds 10,000.
Trading profits at the USM-quoted builders' merchant fell from Pounds
146,000 to Pounds 118,000 as its G Blagg subsidiary suffered difficult
conditions with recessionary pressures continuing.
Turnover fell from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 2.62m, reflecting the company's
tightening of credit controls. Earnings per share were 9.61p (0.02p losses)
or 0.26p (0.35p) if the effects of restructuring are taken out.
The company intends changing its name to Blagg.

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Renold rolling along for more than a
century - David Blackwell on a chainmaker for fairgrounds, forklifts,
supertankers and jump jets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bush roller chain, invented for the bicycle more than a hundred years
ago, must qualify as a design classic.
It is a simple concept that works well, and has been around for a lot longer
than many acknowledged classics such as the Zippo cigarette lighter and the
Anglepoise lamp.
It was patented in 1880 by Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, a year after
he founded a company in Manchester to make chains for bicycles.
Its applications in the late 20th century include the mechanism for
controlling the vector thrusts in Harrier jump jets, fairground rides, car
engines and printing machinery.
The company that still bears his name no longer makes bicycle chains, but it
remains the second biggest chain producer in the world, after Tsubaki of
Japan.
While the Renold group also makes gears and compressors, chains still
represent 61 per cent of sales, which totalled just over Pounds 125m in the
year to end-March 1993.
Last November, Renold announced a trebling of interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 2.4m on turnover ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 65.4m.
Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said the company was beginning to reap
the benefits of its capital investment programme. City analysts are looking
for pre-tax profits for the current year of about Pounds 5m, compared with
Pounds 1.2m in 1992-93 and a loss of Pounds 3m the year before.
While the basic components of inner and outer sideplates, pins, bushes and
rollers have remained unchanged, the method of manufacture has changed
dramatically.
Mr Ian Trotter, group director for chains, points out that a chain is a
linked section of bearings, and needs the same precision in manufacture as
bearings do. 'That's where Renold's expertise is highly regarded.'
Over the past three years Renold has reorganised its chain manufacturing
into three main centres. The biggest factory is at Einbeck in Germany, where
all the medium chain -  1/2 inch to   3/4 inch - and forklift truck chain is
made.
The plant at Calais makes the timing chain used in car engines to drive
camshafts. The market for this is increasing in spite of falling world
vehicle production as chain retakes market share from belts.
The Manchester operation concentrates on large chain, from 1 inch up to 5
inch. It moved from Burnage, where manufacture and assembly were carried on
in two separate factories, to Bredbury in 1990.
The investment in the new factory and cellular production was part of the
group's Pounds 33m capital investment programme between 1989 and 1992.
Since the move, production of all 1 inch and 1 1/4 inch chain has become
automated, cutting out at least three production processes. Most of the
volume sales from Bredbury are in 1 inch chain, which is used extensively in
machinery in many industries, such as packaging and processing.
However, links for the bigger chains, whose uses range from marine diesel
engines for supertankers to fairground rides, are still assembled by hand by
operators using large presses. The cost of automating the manufacture of the
larger chains would be prohibitive, according to Mr John Allan, group
finance director, because of the lower volume of production.
Bredbury also pioneered the cellular production system which is now being
applied throughout the group. The new linear system both made the product
flow more visible and gave more effective control.
The group has spent Pounds 9m on the factory, which employs 275 people
compared with 350 on the old site.
While the machine tools are Japanese, Renold's expertise has gone into the
production engineering and tooling, and the cellular approach to production.
Mr Allan believes the factory, which also makes toothed wheels on which its
chains run, is now very efficient. However it has substantial additional
capacity, subject to extra manning.
Mr John Kelly, manufacturing manager at Bredbury, said that the
reorganisation and investment in new machinery had cut lead times from 26
days to 5 days and improved productivity by 30 per cent in the past two
years.

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Japanese raises Pounds 162m in
conversion issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A conversion share issue by Fleming Japanese Investment Trust has raised
Pounds 162m, making it the largest investment trust C share issue on record.
The institutional placing accounted for Pounds 94.9m of the total, after
which the maximum size for the trust was set at Pounds 250m, so that there
would be no need to scale back applications in the public offer.
The trust is already the largest fund in its sector with assets of Pounds
309m, and the issue will increase that by more than 50 per cent.
Heavy demand for funds offering exposure to the Japanese market, at a time
when recovery is expected to take off, has pushed the share price of most
investment trusts in the sector to a premium to net asset value.
Fidelity Japanese Values, a new investment trust specialising in smaller
companies which is currently in its public offer period, has also
experienced strong demand from institutions.
Conversion of the Fleming C shares is expected to take place on March 21,
when dealings in the new shares will start. One warrant will be attached to
every five shares.

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MAI cashes in Havas stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the broadcasting and moneybroking group, is cashing in its stake in
Havas, the French media combine, some four years earlier than anticipated.
The move eliminates the last vestiges of MAI's links with Mills &amp; Allen, the
outdoor advertising company which gave the UK group its name and was merged
into the French company in 1989.
MAI announced yesterday that it had sold its 3 per cent convertible bond
holding in Havas - which represents a 1.5 per cent stake in the French group
upon conversion - in the market for FFr391m (Pounds 44.8m).
The stake has risen in value by 17 per cent over the last year, as falling
French interest rates increased the attraction of convertible bond
investments. MAI is thought to have decided that it would derive greater
benefit from the cash, as further substantial progress was considered
unlikely before the redemption date. The stake was redeemable in December
1997 for about Pounds 50m.
MAI said proceeds would be used for 'general corporate purposes'. However,
if applied to reduce debt, the deal will leave it virtually ungeared after
its Anglia Television bid, which was given the go-ahead this month.
MAI's stake in Havas is the legacy of the 1989 merger by the two groups of
certain media interests into Avenir Havas Media. In 1992, MAI swapped its
15.2 per cent stake in Havas for the convertible bond holding.

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Groupe Chez Gerard on stock market menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of London's most fashionable eating places are to be floated on the
Stock Exchange at the end of next month.
Groupe Chez Gerard owns Bertorelli's in Covent Garden, Cafe Fish off
Haymarket, Soho Soho in Frith Street and three Chez Gerard restaurants. It
also operates and has a 25.5 per cent stake in Chutney Mary in Chelsea.
The group is expected to have a market value of over Pounds 17m after the
flotation, which is expected to raise between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m of new
money. The shares will be placed with institutions, although some will be
made available to group employees.
Mr Laurence Isaacson, deputy chairman, said yesterday that the group was
raising the money in order to expand the business faster in London. 'We want
to utilise our brands fully, with the emphasis on Chez Gerard and Cafe
Fish.'
The restaurants are owned by Mr Isaacson and Mr Neville Abraham, chairman
and chief executive. The pair entered the restaurant business in 1980,
converting a banana warehouse next door to the Royal Opera House into Cafe
des Amis du Vin, which they sold in 1984 for Pounds 2.2m.

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Restricted growth at Isotron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp reduction in interest receivable restricted growth in first-half
profits at Isotron, the sterilisation company.
Profits were Pounds 1.51m pre-tax for the six months to end-December,
compared with Pounds 1.44m previously.
Interest income fell from Pounds 192,000 to Pounds 100,000, reflecting the
combined effect of lower interest rates and the group's investment in a new
plant in Ireland.
Operating profits were almost 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.41m (Pounds
1.25m), helped by higher volumes in medical sterilisation, which accounts
for more than half of sales.
However, Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said the group's biological and chemical
businesses had shown little growth because of weak European demand. Total
turnover increased by 10 per cent, from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 3.79m.
Mr Clive said most of the capital expenditure on the Irish plant had been
made, and it was on schedule for trials at the end of April. The plant is
expected to incur a small loss in the final quarter as the trials are
carried out.
Earnings per share were 8.1p (7.8p). The interim dividend is increased to
1.66p (1.51p.)

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Crean raises IPounds 63m to fund
development

<TEXT>
James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, has announced a
rights issue, together with a five-year convertible loan stock issue, to
raise a total of IPounds 62.8m (Pounds 60.4m), to be used for debt reduction
and acquisitions.
A total of 11.4m new shares will be issued at 265p per share, on a basis of
35 new units for every existing 100 units.
The 1999 convertible loan stock, which carries a 7.25 per cent coupon, will
raise IPounds 32.6m on the basis of IPounds 1 of stock for every share held.
The loan stock will be convertible into shares on the basis of 32.258 shares
for IPounds 100 of loan stock.
AIB Capital markets and J&amp;E Davy are to underwrite the issue.
The company said that proceeds of the rights would reduce indebtedness,
extend the debt maturity profile and finance 'an increasing number of
development opportunities' in its food, electrical wholesaling and print and
packaging divisions.
Gearing is currently close to 100 per cent, with year-end debt estimated at
IPounds 76m. The issue will make an immediate significant reduction in
gearing and fund development in the near and medium term.
The company anticipates pre-tax profits of not less than IPounds 16m before
exceptional items and goodwill amortisation for the year ended December 31
1993.
Results are due to be published next month, and according to the company no
exceptional charges are anticipated.
Crean reported a IPounds 15.4m loss last year, following a IPounds 32.5m
total write-off of IAS, its aircraft leasing subsidiary. Excluding this
item, it reported a pre-tax profit of IPounds 17m.

FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Sheafbank raises Pounds 8.1m via placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheafbank Property Trust is to raise Pounds 8.1m through a placement to fund
the purchase from Philips Pension Fund of the outstanding 50 per cent of UK
Estates, a property company with a portfolio valued at Pounds 21.9m.
Following the acquisition, Sheafbank is to change its name to UK Estates,
and has appointed Mr David Ormerod, former managing director of Legal and
General Properties, as managing director.
The group is placing 35m shares at 25 3/4 p, a 5 per cent discount to
Thursday's closing price.
The shares will be offered to shareholders on a 1-for-3 basis with one new
share for every one convertible preference share.
Of the proceeds, Pounds 4.3m will be used for the UK Estates stake.
This is a substantial discount to the present valuation, reflecting the
strength of the property market since the deal was negotiated in mid-1993.
The balance will help reduce gearing to about 95 per cent. Following the
transaction, the value of Sheafbank's property portfolio will increase by
Pounds 22m to Pounds 33m.
Mr David Gradel, chairman, said the enhanced rental income and strengthened
balance sheet would provide a base for expansion.
The announcement was accompanied by results for the six months to December
31, which showed a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 280,000 (Pounds 200,000).
Losses per share were 1.78p (1.29p).
Sheafbank has a Pounds 2m deficit on its profit and loss account, but plans
to cancel this through transfers from the share premium account.

<TEXT>
Sir, Reading your article about dress codes around the world (Fashion,
February 19/20), I thought it ridiculous that British shoppers in Bond
Street or Knightsbridge know that if they are not to be patronised or
dismissed by up-market sales assistants, they must dress up in smart,
fashionable clothes which excite the sales assistant's label-conscious envy.
What a sad state of affairs when you have to dress to impress the people who
work in the store where you have chosen to do your shopping] Far from Brits
knowing what works, it seems to me that these up-market shoppers are
pathetically insecure and have allowed themselves to be coerced into
pandering to a bunch of condescending and snobbish shop girls. These people
are employees who you are paying to serve your needs]
Now I understand more clearly why the sun finally set on the British Empire.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Tinkering, tailoring, soldiering on: George Graham on the
role of the CIA after the arrest of a senior officer on spying charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Espionage, according to Mr James Jesus Angleton, the US master spy in the
cold war years, is a 'wilderness of mirrors'.
The mirror held up this week by the arrest of a senior officer of the
Central Intelligence Agency on charges of spying for Russia reflects an
unexpected light on the CIA. While senators fulminate at Russia's gall in
continuing to spy on the US - a pursuit which has apparently already been
curtailed because of budget cuts - another question has lurked unanswered:
why should the CIA devote virtually as much effort to spying on Russia as it
did for the old Soviet Union?
The question is not being asked with great urgency in Washington at the
moment. The immediate impact of the arrest of Mr Aldrich Ames, a former head
of CIA counter-intelligence activities targeting the Soviet Union and
eastern Europe, was to expose shortcomings in the agency's internal security
precautions. The case also showed that spying did not die with the cold war.
On one level, it makes the CIA as necessary as ever, because it is obvious
that the old enemy has not passed away entirely.
But however devastating the consequences of Mr Ames's alleged treachery for
the CIA's own operations - members of Congress have been told that he sent
at least 10 Soviet citizens working for the US to their deaths - it seems in
some respects part of a deadly game of little relevance to the wider course
of world events.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, eliminating the greatest threat to
US security, the intelligence services, like the military, have sought new
challenges: the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism,
narcotics and economic intelligence.
'At no time during the last 30 years has intelligence been more important or
more challenged than it is now,' said General James Clapper, head of US
military intelligence.
The CIA, in particular, has also put on a smiling public face to suit the
times. Last year it published a 43-page Consumer's Guide to Intelligence -
although the document is already out of print and unobtainable - and it has
begun to declassify a large portion of its more historic intelligence
analyses, not to mention its files on the assassination of President John
Kennedy.
Mr James Woolsey, its director since last year, has been more open than any
of his predecessors; appearing not only in frequent public hearings on
Capitol Hill but also on Mr Larry King's live call-in show on CNN
television.
But while some see a willingness to adapt to changed circumstances, others
see another bureaucracy desperately trying to invent new missions to justify
its bloated budget.
The US intelligence budget is an official secret, concealed within overall
Pentagon spending. Many senior members of Congress have begun to press for
at least the total, widely believed to be about Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) a
year, to be made public. Of this, perhaps 15 per cent goes to the CIA, with
the lion's share absorbed by the expensive satellites and electronic
eavesdropping equipment of the National Security Agency and the Defense
Intelligence Agency - which, unlike the independent CIA, report to the
defence department.
President Bill Clinton requested a small increase in the 1994 intelligence
budget, but Congress froze it. The administration's request for 1995,
submitted earlier this month, is 'essentially flat', said Mr Woolsey.
He told members of Congress this week that the total intelligence budget had
fallen since 1990 by 14 per cent after adjusting for inflation, and that
CIA, NSA and DIA personnel would be cut by more than 22 per cent over the
course of this decade. 'United States intelligence capabilities are being
reduced to a level where . . . we are skating on thin ice on a warm day,' Mr
Woolsey said.
But even if the budget is being curbed, some intelligence experts question
whether the new missions the CIA has adopted are appropriate, or at least
whether the CIA is the agency best equipped to carry them out.
Some see a wasteful overlap, for example, between the CIA's expansion into
counter-narcotics and the overseas undercover operations of the Drug
Enforcement Agency, which comes under the aegis of the Justice Department.
Narcotics activities are also said to have created morale problems within
the agency for officers who have seen their jobs change radically.
Even more questionable, to many, is an area described by Mr Woolsey as 'the
hottest current topic in intelligence issues'. He said the CIA was being
asked by the Washington administration to assess how some governments
violated the rules of the game in international trade.
'This does not mean that the CIA is in the business of economic espionage -
for example, trying to learn the business plans of foreign companies in
order to give such information to American firms.
'It does mean, however, that we are paying careful attention to those
countries or businesses who are spying on our firms to the disadvantage of
American business and American workers, and to those governments and foreign
companies that try to bribe their way into obtaining contracts that they
cannot win on the merits,' he said.
Many businesses are sceptical of Mr Woolsey's claim that the CIA has saved
billions of dollars for US companies in this way. The claim is unverifiable
for, as the CIA director said, 'most such companies never realise that they
have received our assistance and even state publicly that they do not need
it . . . That's fine with us. It's the nature of the intelligence business.'
But the topic raises questions both within the agency, among officers who
are ready to risk their lives for their country but not for IBM, and in
Congress, where some members feel such intelligence does not warrant the use
of taxpayers' funds.
Even more fundamentally, Democratic Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska
wonders whether the CIA does a better job of assessing economic trends or
election outcomes than private sector information gatherers, such as
financial analysts.
'I appreciate the world tour that you gave us and I find it to be very
reliable and very dependable and very interesting, but I must say I had a
recent world tour given to me by a currency trader in New York City that I
find to be equally reliable and interesting and dependable,' Mr Kerrey told
Mr Woolsey last month at a hearing of the Senate intelligence committee.
Those who have seen CIA analyses say that their data are often banal and
their judgments often misguided. They are also, frequently, less timely than
Reuters or CNN.
Mr Woolsey acknowledged that on many issues the CIA's hunches 'are not
necessarily going to be better than that of a good university faculty or the
newsroom of a good newspaper'. That may not be good enough to fight off the
threat of deeper cuts in the intelligence budget.

Sir, Sir Teddy Taylor complains ('Tories split over European allies' federal
stance in poll manifesto') that British Conservative MPs are whipped along
Westminster lines in the Parliamentary Group of the European People's party.
I am proud that we are, because I introduced the system to our continental
colleagues. It is regularly used to our advantage, for example to defeat the
parliament's left-wing majority's 'no confidence' motion in the British
presidency of the council.
Of course, the whip does not have the same power and patronage as at
Westminster, because there is no European government to defend or bring
down.
From time to time all national sections of the EPP decline the group whip,
when their individual party or national interest is in conflict with it.
Long may that practice continue.

Sir, Fundamental errors occurred in your article, 'Tories split over
European allies' federal stance in poll manifesto' (February 24).
The European People's party, whose manifesto will be published on Friday,
does not, as your opening paragraph asserts, include the British
Conservative party. The Conservative party has no formal links at all with
the EPP.
The manifesto is that of the party, not of the European Parliamentary Group
as stated in the second paragraph. It has not been kept under wraps to spare
Conservative embarrassment or for any reason other than the need to have the
original (French) version translated into the other eight Community
languages. It follows that your later statement to the effect that John
Major has secured an opt-out from some of the federalist elements of the
manifesto is entirely spurious - neither he nor any other representatives of
the Conservative party negotiated any part of the text.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Contracting out could mean pensions
burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Rice's article 'Strings attached to contracting out' (Business
and the Law, February 22), illustrates the problems contractors face in
market testing exercises in dealing with the Transfer of Undertakings
Regulations.
The latest particular problem is the attorney-general's advice that
contractors must offer comparable pensions to those enjoyed in the public
sector. You state contractors may wish to challenge this view. In fact we
are doing so.
At a consultation meeting with contractors last month, Mr Tony Baldry, the
junior local government minister, agreed to withdraw such advice to local
authorities, pending resolution of the matter, after a unanimous protest
that this advice is wrong in law. For market testing in central government,
however, the advice from the Cabinet Office still stands.
Through the Confederation of British Industry, contractor organisations have
since taken counsel's opinion which confirms that the government's advice is
incorrect. Even if the government adheres to its view, because the
interpretation is quite independent of the Acquired Rights Directive, it
would be free to introduce the necessary legislation to remove any
entitlement.
This issue has now become central to the success of the government's market
testing policy. Actuarial calculations suggest that matching the
index-linked pensions of the public sector would require private sector
employers to make contributions of up to 25 per cent of salary. Such a
burden would force many contractors out of the game altogether, and render
many innovative private sector bids uncompetitive.
If the government wishes to maximise the benefits of its market testing
programme, it must now act swiftly at least to reverse its advice on pension
benefits.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Not yet on board for the ride: David Gardner on the likely
delays to enlargement of the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enlargement - extending the European Union north to the Arctic Circle and
the borders of Russia, and east to the Hungarian frontier - was supposed to
be a breeze.
The new members - Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria - are rich market
economies, with per capita incomes higher than the EU average. Moreover,
these four, plus Iceland, had already assented to more than 1,400 laws
governing freedom of movement for capital, labour, goods and services when
they set up the joint free trade zone with the Union known as the European
Economic Area. This 13,000-page treaty, which came into force this year,
surely exhausted most of what there was to negotiate on full membership of
the Union.
There would no doubt be hiccups over the obsolete tradition of neutrality of
all the applicants except Nato member Norway, it was generally thought. But
then in a post-cold war world - releasing the east and central Europeans
into the queue to join the EU - surely nobody could afford to resist the
magnetic pull of the single European market?
As batteries of ministers from the 12 existing and four would-be members
assembled in Brussels last night for what is billed as the final, marathon
round of the enlargement negotiations, there are serious worries. Both sides
doubt whether the deadline for concluding the talks at midnight on February
28 will be met, and whether all four applicants will ever make it into the
EU.
The difficulties have been underestimated: in timing, in the substance of
the negotiations, and in what might be described as cultural differences
between the Union and the Nordic countries.
The Union's self-imposed deadline was set to permit the four to enter by
January 1 1995. The EU goal was to demonstrate the dynamism of the new Union
to the public, whose enthusiasm for Euro-integration is ebbing fast.
But Euro MPs, up for re-election in June, must approve the accession treaty
between March 10 and May 4. There is no certainty they will get either a
text to examine or - with election campaigning likely to reduce normally
poor attendance at the European Parliament even further  - a quorum to
ratify it. Failure by Strasbourg to ratify would upset plans in all four
applicant countries for the referendums essential to sell the charms of EU
membership to sharply divided voters.
Opinion in Finland and Austria has been more or less evenly split, with a
slight advantage for the Yes camp. More Swedes want to stay out than go in,
but the opposition Social Democrats could change that if they win
September's elections. In Norway, however, where voters rejected membership
in 1972, there is a solid majority against the EU, even though the pro-entry
cause is inching forward.
If entry terms are agreed, then much could depend on arranging a 'virtuous
sequence' of referendums in likely order of winnability. Many Norwegian
officials see little chance of their people voting yes unless the Union
absorbs the rest of the Nordic region and fear of isolation grows. In
Scandinavia, as one EU diplomat puts it, entry depends on voting 'following
the sun, from east to west' - Finland first, then Sweden, and hopefully by
then, a rather cold-feeling Norway.
But Norway and the others insist they must get saleable terms, which it is
not clear the EU can deliver.
The European Commission's enlargement 'task force', led by Mr Steffen Smidt,
a Dane with an acute feel for Nordic sensibility and political psychology,
has tried to arrange the arcana of the negotiations into packages which look
as if the EU is adapting to the newcomers' concerns in areas such as the
environment and social policy. A deal agreed in December on the environment
and safety standards, hailed as a victory by all four candidates, was
imaginatively crafted. 'It'snot unintentional,' one lead Brussels negotiator
remarked archly, 'that it sounds like they're pulling us up to their
standards.'
But as negotiations reach the crunch point, there are clear signs of a
backlash among the 12 member states about who is supposed to be joining
whom. 'If they want to come in they must accept our rules,' a senior Spanish
official says. A Dutch diplomat explains: 'Both sides see the other side as
the demandeur.'
It should just be possible to settle the three linked issues of agriculture
and regional subsidies in Arctic and Alpine areas, and the still sensitive
budgetary conundrum of who pays for what. At the moment, the rich newcomers
are being asked to make net contributions to the Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn) EU
budget of about Ecu1.7bn a year - less than half original expectations - but
to align their higher farm prices at EU levels immediately and pay the
difference themselves to their farmers.
But as Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spanish European affairs minister, puts it:
'The problem of Ecus is easy to solve in the end; it's the problems of
philosophy that are difficult.' He should know.
Spain wants the right to catch 14,000 tonnes of Norwegian fish. Spain got a
bad deal on fisheries in its 1986 accession treaty. Madrid is determined
that Norway is not going to come in on better terms than it achieved, and a
French-led group will not allow Norwegian fish free access to the EU market.
Spain is prepared to negotiate, but wants some restitution of the fish it
lost when it was barred from Norwegian waters in 1981.
Oslo's position is simple and unswerving: not a single fish for Spain. 'We
do not negotiate with Spain; we negotiate with the Union,' Ms Grete Knudsen,
Norway's external trade minister said tartly this week.
This is 'a real crunch issue', a UK negotiator says. 'I think I know where
their (the Norwegians') bottom line is, and it's very hard.'
Austria, too, has an emotive environmental 'crunch' issue: the volume of EU
lorries transiting its Alpine passes. Swiss voters last Sunday chose to ban
all EU trucks through their passes within 10 years (see accompanying
report). Vienna therefore wants its restrictions on Union traffic, set to
last until 2004, stapled to the back of its accession treaty. The EU is
offering to keep the transit deal for only three years. Yet both sides now
fear this could scupper Austria's referendum on entry.
Even if all this can be settled, the 'cultural' differences will be thrown
into sharp relief by the referendum campaigns.
Many in Finland and among its Nordic neighbours, though worried about the
rise of ultra-nationalism in Russia, are unimpressed by the EU and its
putative security policy. 'There will still be two competing power centres
in Europe, the EU and Russia, and Russia is our immediate neighbour,' says
Professor Jan-Magnus Jansson, a former Finnish trade minister and anti-EU
leader.
Bosnia, he adds, 'is not a very convincing argument for depending on the EU
for our security'. The 'Zhirinovsky factor', the Finnish polls show, is
frightening voters into the EU camp but stampeding almost as many back to
the tried policy of neutrality.
Less tangibly, the Nordics (like the Euro-sceptical Danes from inside the
EU) dislike what many see as a grouping likely to sacrifice environment and
welfare standards for raw commercial gain, which moreover they believe
benefits the centre more than the periphery of Europe. Used to open
government, they see the EU as secretive and centralised. The protestants in
the north are also used to lots of women in senior jobs; Nordic women in
particular look down at the predominantly Catholic EU, and are set to vote
heavily against it.
The negotiating deadline is almost certainly, therefore, going to have to be
stretched. 'My view is that this could be quite a long February. In fact it
could turn out to be a leap year,' says a senior UK official. But even if
that works for the negotiations, it is going to be hard to sell the results.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Trucks headed off at the pass: The Swiss ban has shocked the
neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Gotthard was anciently perhaps the most frequented passage over the
Alps, as it offered the most direct and practicable line of communication
from northern Switzerland and western Germany, to Lombardy, and the
important cities of Milan and Genoa. Not less than 16,000 travellers and
9,000 horses crossed it annually on the average, down to the commencement of
the present century' - Murray's Handbook for Travellers in Switzerland, 1838
The problem is the pollution,' says Mrs Marie-Therese Hogg, a young
housewife and mother of two in Andermatt, a Swiss village in the middle of
the Gotthard pass.
Mrs Hogg was not referring to horses, but to the 2,500 trucks a day that
have replaced earlier forms of transport on the ever popular trans-Alpine
route. While in previous centuries, travellers and their carriages brought
prosperity to the tiny Swiss canton of Uri that bestrides the Gotthard, the
trucks bring only misery.
'My older son has asthma. Our family doctor says the incidence of asthma
here is far higher than normal,' Mrs Hogg says.
Mr Beat Baumann, a mountain guide based in Uri's historic capital of
Altdorf, says that, in the summer, residents are often advised to remain
indoors rather than risk breathing the fumes from the nearby motorway.
In the past month, the 34,000 inhabitants of Uri have risen up against their
oppressor, mounting an effective campaign to convince their fellow Swiss to
support their petition to ban transit lorries from the Alps. Knowing that
their own reputation as rather dour mountain folk would not win much
sympathy for their plight - one exasperated federal minister referred to
them this week as troglodytes - the Uri campaigners emphasised the damage
being done to the Alpine flora and fauna by fumes.
The stratagem worked. Last Sunday, nearly 52 per cent of all Swiss ignored
federal government advice and voted in favour of forcing all transit freight
traffic to shift from the road to the railways from 2004.
The result was an unpleasant shock for the country's neighbours. Officials
of the European Union, who had only two years ago agreed trans-Alpine truck
limits with Switzerland, wondered if it was worth negotiating anything any
more with the recalcitrant Swiss. The EU's powerful trucking lobbies were
apoplectic.
If the EU does stop negotiating with Bern on other issues, anti-EU sentiment
in Switzerland could well harden, forcing an indefinite postponement of
Bern's plan to attempt to join the Union in a few years.
These weighty considerations had little influence in Uri. 'The (trucks) vote
had nothing to do with European politics,' says Mrs Hogg. 'It was about our
future.'
Mr Hansruedi Stadler, Uri's youthful governor, agrees. Sitting in a modest
office at Altdorf looking over a square dominated by a statue of Wilhelm
Tell, he asks rhetorically: 'What could I tell my six-year-old son in 10
years if we had not done everything we could to stop the destruction of our
region?'
Uri is not isolationist, Mr Stadler insists. Unlike some other mountain
regions in Switzerland, it has enjoyed constant contact with the outside
world since the 13th century, when the Gotthard pass was opened. The problem
is that the narrow Reuss valley leading up to the Gotthard is Uri's only
habitable territory. The rest is so steep that only goats and chamois can
survive there.
Until the late 20th century, the stately pace of travel meant that it was
pleasant to be an important transit corridor. Everyone stopped in Uri's
village inns for food and lodging. But since the construction of an
all-weather motorway in the 1970s, it has become easy to drive from one end
of the canton to the other in 45 minutes. 'Most people in transit now stop
in Uri only to go to the toilet, if they stop at all,' Mr Stadler says.
He adds that the fumes from the trucks can hang in the narrow valley for
days if the wind is light and the fog is thick, which it often is. Mrs Hogg
says even the Ursuren valley around Andermatt, high above the Gotthard
tunnels, often becomes polluted because of fumes from the road tunnel
exhaust vents.
Mr Baumann sees other problems on the steep mountain sides. 'Trees have been
killed, then knocked down by the strong fohn (south-west wind) storms,
increasing the incidence of avalanches and landslides.'
Local people also worry about an environmental catastrophe. Trucks are not
allowed to carry dangerous substances along the route, but many do. An
explosion in the Gotthard tunnel would have appalling consequences: a spill
of chemicals into the Reuss could contaminate the entire Rhine valley, Mr
Baumann says.
So are Uri's people satisfied now that they can see the end of the truck
blight? And how do they feel about the constant rise in motor car traffic?
Mr Stadler sighs. 'Yes, cars . . . obviously, we would prefer that more of
them would take the old road and stop at our inns.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bureaucracy stalls road building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Long public inquiries are not the main reason for the length of time it
takes to build a road. The average public inquiry lasts just 16 days. The
lengthy public inquiries, such as those at Twyford Down or the M11, are the
exception.
The main reason it takes 13 years to plan and build a road lies somewhere
within the cumbersome bureaucracy of the Department of Transport. Transport
secretary John MacGregor's high-profile campaign ('Faster inquiries aim to
cut years off road building', February 23) to shorten public inquiries will
do little to alter that.

Sir, Perhaps Mr Jacques Toubon, culture minister of France, has not had the

Anglo-Saxon countries are 'deploying considerable efforts . . . to conquer
new territory for their language' ('France steps up battle with English
language', February 24) would surely be laid to rest. One must only walk a

FT  26 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Bond market's bull is gored
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All good things, including global bull markets in bonds, come to an end. The
question is whether now is such a time. It might be - not because inflation
is about to explode, but because there is little reason to expect it to fall
much further either. By the beginning of this year, nominal long-term
interest rates had fallen as far as economic fundamentals justified. Given
that, any shock should be enough to generate a correction.
The Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates in early
February provided just such a change. The caution about base rate cuts
expressed by Mr Kenneth Clarke's six 'wise men' this week may have added one
for UK gilts. Realisation of just how cautiously the Bundesbank intends to
lower interest rates may have had a similar effect on other European bond
markets.
Two points about the background to the bond market correction must be
remembered: the first is that nominal long-term interest rates had fallen to
remarkably low levels by the end of 1993 and the second is that falls in
recent years have been hugely rewarding.
In the US, for example, long bond yields bottomed out in October 1993 at 5.2
per cent, this being not only a sharp fall from the cyclical peak level of
9.3 per cent experienced in 1989, but also a level not seen since the early
1970s. Japanese long-term yields had fallen from 7.8 per cent in September
1990 to 3.1 per cent in January 1994, a level achieved once before, briefly,
in 1987.
Even in Germany, records have been struck. The long-term interest rate
reached 5.5 per cent at the beginning of this year, down from around 9 per
cent in 1990. In the last 25 years, long bond rates have been below 6 per
cent only in 1978 and 1986-87. As for the UK, long-term bond rates peaked in
1990 at nearly 13 per cent, before declining to just above 6 per cent in
early 1994, levels not seen since the first half of the 1960s.
Speculators' fortunes
After two miserable decades, during which long-term bond investors have been
plucked like so many chickens, yields have plummeted to the levels of before
the great inflation. In the process, speculators have made fortunes. The
question is not so much why this may have stopped, but whether it made sense
for the rally to go so far in the first place.
Start with the fundamentals. The long-term rate of interest ought to reflect
the real rate of interest, plus inflationary expectations. A good indication
of the former is provided by the British government's index-linked gilt,
whose yield fell to about 2 per cent in late 1993, down from a peak of 5 per
cent at the time of sterling's expulsion from the ERM.
There are two reasons for this sharp decline. One, which is UK-specific, is
the disappearance, following sterling's depreciation, of the expectation
that the currency would have to depreciate. The second is the realisation
that the global demand for capital would remain sluggish for a fairly long
period.
Given the interconnection of the global capital markets and the absence of
powerful expectations of further real exchange rate changes, the UK real
rate of interest provides a global benchmark. If so, it suggests that
long-term inflation expectations could have been as low as 1 per cent in
Japan and about 3-4 per cent in Germany, the US and even the UK.
Profitable business
Bond yields could go much lower than they were, on a sustained basis, only
if there were further downward revisions of inflationary expectations. How
likely was this to happen? Rates of inflation in the US, for example, could
average 2 per cent over the next decade, but they could easily average 4 per
cent.
Speculation also enters the picture. If short-term rates of interest are
below long-term ones, there is no carrying cost to borrowing short term in
order to invest long term. If bond yields are expected to fall, this looks a
highly profitable business. So it has been for US banks.
The expectation of short-term gain cannot continue forever. A rise in the
cost of short-term borrowing is likely to achieve precisely this result, by
increasing the cost of speculation on further increases in bond prices and
driving speculators from the buying side of the market.
The action of Mr Greenspan's Federal Reserve in early February simply
pricked the speculative element in the US bond balloon. Nothing he said this
week suggests he is particularly worried about inflation. Nor, for that
matter, were Mr Clarke's wise men. Speculation on further declines in bond
yields looks more costly.
Since the real yield on index-linked gilts has itself risen by half a
percentage point from its trough, the worldwide rise in bond yields can only
be partly due to deteriorating inflationary expectations. Higher real rates
of interest would reflect the end of speculation, but also the growing
plausibility of recovery. Either way it is nothing to worry about, except,
of course, for those who have been caught short.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Woman in the News: Survivor in turbulent seas - Colette Bowe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an industry where aggressive sales pitches - to the regulators as well as
to customers - are a fact of life, Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive of the
Personal Investment Authority, is earning a reputation for toughness.
'She can stand up to the big boys,' says a colleague on the PIA.
When planning was under way for the embryonic authority, the regulatory
organisation to oversee retail financial services, Mr Mick Newmarch, chief
executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, launched a bitter
attack on the proposals. Last summer he called for a full-blown statutory
system of regulation.
Ms Bowe kept quiet at the time. Even now, it is only through a colleague
that the degree to which she was 'pretty fed up' has emerged.
Then, Ms Bowe was in charge of retail financial services at the Securities
and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog and the PIA's parent
regulator. She moved to her present post in January when it was still not
clear whether the dispute over the composition and role of the PIA would
result in it being stillborn.
There was agreement among the industry's practitioners that a single
regulatory organisation was needed to replace Lautro and Fimbra, which
oversee life insurance companies and independent financial advisers
respectively.
But for months the PIA had been dogged by a series of setbacks. Its
chairman, Sir Gordon Downey, had departed abruptly last autumn amid
complaints about lack of progress. And there was a seemingly endless debate
about the form of regulation and the standards of selling which should be
applied throughout the industry.
Now the mood seems to have changed a little. Standard Life, a leading UK
insurer, said this week that despite its preference for a statutory system,
it was likely to join the PIA. Criticism has subsided in the wake of the
authority's prospectus, released this week, which has contributed to a
grudging acceptance that the PIA will come into being this summer.
This shift in attitude can be partly attributed to Ms Bowe's appointment.
She is both a symbol and a cause of the PIA's new-found confidence. 'The
difference in staff morale has been tremendous,' said one PIA board member.
Industry insiders believe she would not have joined a sinking ship, but they
also acknowledge that her managerial skills have helped to put the ship on
the right course.
Her talent for political survival was honed the hard way, as chief press
secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry during the 1986 Westland
affair. The row over the future of the UK helicopter company led two cabinet
ministers - her boss Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Michael Heseltine, then defence
secretary - to resign and almost caused the downfall of Mrs Margaret
Thatcher.
Ms Bowe played a starring role. She leaked to the Press Association news
group the extracts of a letter from the solicitor-general, which appeared to
support the DTI argument for allowing Westland to link up with Sikorsky of
the US. Mr Heseltine on the other hand wanted to find a European solution
for Westland.
Ms Bowe, although cleared by a Commons select committee inquiry of any
wrongdoing in leaking the letter, stayed only about a year at the DTI, given
the ensuing sour atmosphere at Westminster. So sensitive is the issue that
even now she will not talk about it - she will not even discuss why she will
not talk about it.
In 1987, aged 40, she was headhunted to join the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, the commercial television watchdog, as director of information.
Two years later - with the fortuitous timing that has become a hallmark of
her career - she was headhunted again, by the SIB. Her job combined a public
affairs function with a regulatory role dealing with investment management.
A week after her move was announced, the government proposed abolishing the
IBA, and replacing it with the Independent Television Commission.
At the SIB, which was in a formative period, Ms Bowe found herself
implementing the financial services legislation which had been one of the
main concerns of the DTI while she was press secretary.
Her civil service training of serving different political masters proved
useful. She prospered under the contrasting regimes operated by Sir David
Walker, SIB chairman until 1992, and Mr Andrew Large, his successor.
For much of Sir David's time, the SIB concentrated on rewriting rules for an
industry which the regulators thought was made up mainly of 'good guys'. Mr
Large's approach has been more sceptical and probing, scrutinising areas
previously left relatively untouched, such as the suspect sale of personal
pensions.
At the PIA Ms Bowe will have more scope for setting her own agenda. One
former colleague who admires her as an administrator expresses some concern
about her attitude towards investor protection. 'She was at the SIB arguing
against the Office of Fair Trading proposals to make sales agents disclose
their commission,' he recalls.
Ms Bowe's response to the debate about statutory versus self-regulation for
the industry is instructive in its pragmatism. 'The question I ask,' she
says, 'is not whether it's statutory or self - but whether it's effective
regulation.'
She knows the Treasury and the SIB - her ultimate masters - see it as her
job to deliver effective investor protection, and it is unlikely she would
have taken on the role had she felt it was impossible.
Given her timely exit from her earlier job at the IBA, Ms Bowe's erstwhile
SIB colleagues should perhaps be rather nervous. For one suggestion being
floated by some financial services practitioners is to scrap the SIB and run
single-tier regulation through the PIA alone. That is an unlikely outcome
but before the PIA could conceive of becoming as powerful as the SIB, it
first has to start work. Arousing enthusiasm rather than resigned acceptance
in the industry is a priority. Ms Bowe must become chief cheerleader.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Talks smothered by cry of outrage: Hebron's massacre may
help secure a settlement if it prompts Israel to deal more flexibly with the
PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The massacre of Palestinians during prayers at a mosque in the occupied West
Bank town of Hebron yesterday is more than an enormous personal tragedy and
a blow to Middle East peace hopes. Carried out by an American-born Jewish
settler on a Friday in the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, the killings are
also laden with symbolism which can be used by Islamic extremists throughout
the region to stir emotions against Israel, established Arab regimes and
their western allies.
The attack could not have been more critically timed to cut the ground from
under the embattled Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, whose leadership has been under increasing assault from within
his own community since he agreed an outline peace accord with Israel last
year.
Few debates are more anguished than that raging over the future of the
Palestinian people. After more than four decades of struggle, bloodshed,
occupation and exile, the Palestinians appeared to be on the brink of
decisions which could decide their place in the Middle East.
Having said 'no' to every proposed solution since the formation of the state
of Israel in 1948, PLO leaders have begun to say 'yes' to proposals which
fall painfully short of the aspirations they nurtured for so long.
On September 13 in Washington the PLO signed a declaration of principles
with Israel which provided for mutual recognition, and a series of signposts
pointing in a number of different directions. Not only did the two sides
disagree about where they are heading, but within Israel, and the wider
Palestinian community, the range of opinions multiplied and diverged still
further.
Yesterday's murders will have stirred a deep well of Palestinian emotion.
But the strength of the declaration of principles still rests on the
unstated fundamentals on which it was built. First, the Palestinian
acknowledgment that the Arab inability to impose a military solution on
Israel had been made absolute by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Second,
that Israel wanted to rid itself of the Gaza Strip, a territory where the
decline in living conditions has given birth to a more virulent form of
Palestinian militancy which campaigns under the flag of radical Islam. To
combat those forces after withdrawal, Israel needed the PLO. Perhaps, after
yesterday's killings, Israel needs the PLO even more.
The coincidence of interest between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, and Mr Arafat, brought the two sides together secretly in Norway
and, ultimately, the two men to a public handshake in Washington. But behind
the international applause, the flames of an internal Palestinian debate had
been fanned into a blaze from which a new unity of purpose might be forged,
or an even bigger disaster ignited.
Hero, or traitor? Pragmatic, wise, national leader, or vain, incompetent
autocrat? The praise and accusations have swirled around the head of Mr
Arafat for the past five months. In Tunis recently, as he sat in front of a
wall-size colour photograph of Jerusalem, gun on hip and ball-point pens
tucked into the sleeve pocket of his olive uniform, Mr Arafat appeared an
unlikely subject for such strong emotions. He was worried about the slow
pace of negotiations with Israel, anxious about deadlines already missed,
cheerfully dismissive of criticism ('that's Palestinian democracy at work'),
and no more forthcoming in private about his intentions than he is in
public.
Many Palestinians, including some who have worked most closely with him,
would recognise the description. Mr Arafat plays his cards famously close to
the chest. Purportedly representing nearly 5m Palestinians, some 2m living
under occupation, only the tiniest number might claim at any one moment to
know what is in the chairman's mind. Only three others are said to have been
fully aware of the secret Norway negotiations with Israel. When Dr Haidar
Abdel Shafi, the widely respected leader of the Palestinian team during 10
rounds of talks with Israel, arrived in Tunis last August for further
instructions, it was to be told a deal had already been struck behind his
back.
It is hardly surprising Dr Shafi later returned to Tunis at the head of a
delegation with a petition demanding Mr Arafat should be more accountable.
Or that Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, who was such a successful and prominent
spokeswoman for the Palestinians after the Madrid peace conference in 1991,
should have decided to pursue another career. Of the 18 members of the PLO
executive committee, its highest policy-making body, a maximum of 10 now
attend meetings.
Palestinian intellectuals, writers and journalists have unleashed a chorus
of protest against their leader: 'You cannot change an elephant into a lion
by sending it a letter,' roared Professor Edward Said recently. 'Yet what we
have is an intolerable mess: it cannot be allowed to continue.' Unless
Palestinians faced up to the leadership crisis they could be resigned 'to a
life of permanent oppression, without land, without a voice in shaping the
future, without hope, even with pride, as the leadership stumbles from
incoherence to incompetence'.
While Prof Said, a leading member of the Palestinian American community, has
adopted a scatter-gun approach to Mr Arafat's failings, other critics have
been more selective, if no less damning. Some, including radical Palestinian
groups based in Damascus, believe the September 13 agreement represents
total capitulation to Israel. For them it is a betrayal of everything
Palestinians have ever fought for, and yesterday they again demanded a
return to armed struggle. Others, such as Dr Shafi, dislike the agreement,
but would like to see if it can be improved. Still more say they fear Mr
Arafat is incapable of sharing power, will not delegate, and ultimately will
frustrate Palestinian ambitions for an open, democratic system of
self-government following Israel's military withdrawal or redeployment in
the West Bank and Gaza. In short, he will be like most other Arab leaders.
Since September 13, Mr Arafat has had little ammunition with which to fire
back. Today he may have even less. The Israelis did not begin to withdraw
troops from Gaza and the West Bank enclave of Jericho as scheduled on
December 13, and Mr Rabin said earlier this week that it could be at least
another month before the pull-back begins.
Support among Palestinians for the peace process had declined sharply even
before yesterday's events. That, too, is Mr Arafat's fault, according not
just to Mr Rabin, but also to the group of Palestinians around Abu Mazen
(proper name Mahmoud Abbas) who masterminded the negotiations in Norway.
The Abu Mazen group ('We are known here as the Jewish agency,' he said
recently with a smile) believes Mr Arafat has wasted valuable time by trying
to insert into the Washington accord more symbols of a nascent state. Abu
Mazen has concluded that, because agreement is almost impossible on many
long-term theoretical issues, such as a future state or the status of
Jerusalem, the Palestinians should take whatever they can on the ground and
work from there.
A senior western diplomat in Tunis in regular contact with the PLO agrees,
but argues that the delays are not solely Mr Arafat's responsibility. 'There
is no doubt that, to answer all the criticism, Arafat has been trying in
every way he can to show that an independent Palestinian state remains his
eventual goal. But at the same time he is up against Rabin, who will not
play a card unless he is assured of winning the trick. The Israelis want
peace, but only on terms set by them, and Arafat is coming to realise what
that means.'
Mr Arafat's frustration shows through with frequent references to his
determination to prevent the creation of a Palestinian bantustan - an entity
with the outward symbols of statehood but none of the powers. 'The Israelis
are tough, unbelievably tough,' he said recently. 'They make everything into
a security issue, even small things which should be dealt with in just two
lines. We need to reach agreements. We have to get back the momentum,
because the whole process is losing support.'
Abu Mazen believed, at least until yesterday, that the momentum and the
support for Mr Arafat could be won back the moment the PLO leader took his
first step on to Palestinian territory. 'There will be one million, maybe
two millions there to greet him. Israeli Arabs will be there and Jews from
the Meretz party and the Peace Now movement. It will be a bigger event than
the September 13 signing. All the support will come back to Arafat, but he
must get there as soon as possible,' he said.
After yesterday it might appear less likely that Mr Arafat will be heading
soon to the occupied territories. But much will depend on how the
Palestinian leader reacts to the Hebron massacre. And that, in turn, may
rest with Mr Rabin.
Reports from Israel yesterday suggested that among many people there was a
surge of shame and grief over what had occurred. For those most actively
involved in seeking the implementation of the Washington accord, the
killings were a tragic reminder of the need for speed and a swift withdrawal
of Israeli troops from Palestinian centres of population, such as Hebron.
The massacre further underlined the explosive potential of the Jewish
settlements spread throughout the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights.
If those factors contribute to a more flexible and generous Israeli approach
to negotiations with the PLO, Mr Arafat and the September 13 agreement could
survive in better shape than seems possible today. Close aides of Mr Arafat
and western diplomats in Tunis equally have no doubt that he could walk away
from the agreement, should he conclude that Palestinian national rights
could not be secured under the present deal, or that too large a part of
popular opinion was turning against him.
'Yassir Arafat is the only truly national leader we have,' a close aide said
recently. 'There is no one else, despite all the criticism. Only he had the
courage and the stature to sign the September 13 agreement. No one else
could have got away with it. He also can break the agreement, if that is
what is necessary, knowing how appalling the consequences will be, not just
for the Palestinian people, but for Israel, and the rest of the Middle
East.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Training targets criticised as too low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers yesterday warned the government that national targets for the
attainment of vocational qualifications and their academic equivalents may
be too low if the UK is to compete effectively in the future.
The warning came from the employer-led National Advisory Council for
Education and Training Targets at a conference to present its first annual
report on progress towards the targets. These were established by the
Confederation of British Industry with the government's backing.
The council says that one of the main targets for the year 2000 is likely to
be reached: for 50 per cent of young people, up to and including
21-year-olds, to have reached a level-three National Vocational
Qualification or its academic equivalent of two A-levels. At present 37 per
cent of young people have reached this skill level.
The report suggests, however, that the UK should be aiming higher.
'International comparisons point to the need to do so,' it says. 'In Japan
80 per cent of young people reached a comparable level in 1986 and in France
the target is 80 per cent by the year 2000.
'Achieving 50 per cent - even before 2000 - is unlikely to bring a
significant improvement in the UK's competitiveness.'
Another target that may be too low, says the council, is that which aims for
50 per cent of the workforce to be qualified to at least NVQ level three or
its academic equivalent by the year 2000.
Mr Peter Davis, Nacett's chairman, said yesterday that the council would be
reviewing all the targets later this year after consultations. He said that
additional targets might need to be established.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the conference
that winning in world markets depended on improving the skills of the
workforce.
Mr Heseltine is preparing a white paper on international competitiveness, to
be published in May. The role of improved skills is expected to be an
important theme.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Energy Saving Trust faces threat from funding row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new threat to the future of the Energy Saving Trust, one of the main
planks of the government's environmental strategy, has emerged in talks
between Whitehall departments.
Officials are concerned that the trust's investments, intended to reach
Pounds 400m a year by the end of the decade, could be classified as public
spending rather than private sector.
The trust, which is the largest single part of the government's plans for
meeting international targets on global warming, is intended to find
projects to help gas and electricity customers use energy more efficiently.
The government wants British Gas and the electricity companies to pass on
the project's costs through consumer bills.
However, the financing plans have met with fierce opposition from Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator.
In Ofgas's annual report, published on Wednesday, she said that the
regulator had an 'overriding duty' to keep prices down, but some of the
trust's schemes would push them up.
Officials from the environment and industry departments and the Treasury
have discussed whether the government will need to legislate to impose a
levy on customers' bills to overcome Ms Spottiswoode's objections. Projects
funded by a levy are likely to be counted as public spending, officials said
yesterday.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, is meeting Lord John Moore, former
cabinet secretary and the trust's chairman, on Tuesday to try to resolve the
problems.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Visible trade deficit with non-EU countries widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union widened
to Pounds 758m in January, from Pounds 671m in December. Imports rose 2.4
per cent over the month to reach a record Pounds 5.88bn. Exports increased 1
per cent to Pounds 5.12bn.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that the trend in the
volume of British trade is deteriorating, but this is being disguised by an
increase in export prices. The so-called 'terms of trade', the balance
between export and import prices, reached a record of 114 in January
(1990=100).
In the three months to January export prices were 2.5 per cent higher than
in the previous three months. Import prices were unchanged.
The CSO estimates that, in value terms, the trend in non-EU trade has been
for both exports and imports to rise by  1/2 per cent a month. In volume
terms, however, exports are rising by  1/2 per cent a month and imports by 1
per cent.
In the three months to January export volumes, excluding oil and erratics,
have fallen  1/2 per cent from the previous three months. Import volumes
have risen 3 1/2 per cent. This has been partly caused by an unusually high
export total in October.
Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS, said: 'Without the support of improving
terms of trade the prospects for the trade deficit in 1994 are bleak.'
The main falls in exports in recent months have been in semi-manufactures
and in food. Basic materials and semi-manufactures have been the main
categories where imports have risen sharply.
If oil and erratic items - such as precious stones and ships - are excluded,
the deficit in January was Pounds 572m, compared with Pounds 478m in
December.
Trade figures for non-EU countries are recorded separately from trade with
countries in the union. Figures for the latter use the new Intrastat system
based on value added tax returns and are reported later.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein wants talks link renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein leaders are to insist at the party's annual conference in Dublin
this weekend that a direct channel of communication with the British
government must be reopened if the Northern Ireland peace process is to move
forward.
Mr Gerry Adams is today expected to use a keynote speech to refer to
'positive aspects' of the Downing Street declaration but to stop short of
giving the document his approval.
The Sinn Fein president will focus on what he sees as the declaration's
shortcomings on the issue of Irish self-determination.
But as republican leaders responded favourably to this week's efforts by
London and Dublin to address nationalist concerns about their joint
initiative, Anglo-Irish tensions were heightened by an Irish High Court
decision to free a terrorist suspect wanted for questioning over the murder
of a soldier.
Mr Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, was released after Mr Justice Feargus
Flood ruled that the alleged offence of killing a soldier in Derby was a
political one for which he could not be extradited.
Meanwhile, mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of the
initiative was underlined when Mr John Taylor, a senior Ulster Unionist MP,
urged his party leadership to boycott new political talks.
The IRA's political wing yesterday reacted positively to an article
published in the Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, in
which Mr John Major, the prime minister, made an eve-of-conference appeal to
republican leaders to embrace the peace process.
Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, said Mr
Major's statement deserved 'very, very careful study'. He said the article -
along with a number of recent speeches by senior ministers - had been 'of
assistance'.
Mr McLoughlin said an offer of a temporary IRA ceasefire made last year
during the secret negotiations between the British government and Sinn Fein
was 'still on the table'.
Mr Major emphasised in the article that the joint declaration left 'no
conceivable reason for continued violence' and that London would not 'try to
persuade people to go for Irish unity'.
But he combined this uncompromising message with a vision of the possible
outcome of political talks designed to reassure nationalists.
After yesterday's Irish High Court decision Mr Michael Mates, the former
Northern Ireland minister, said the case was 'another example of what we
have been complaining about to the Irish for a long time. Their extradition
laws are flawed. They have acknowledged they are flawed.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / Children's cartoons help video sales surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of Mowgli, a boy brought up by some kindly wolves, a conscientious
panther called Bagheera and a happy-go-lucky bear named Baloo helped boost
UK video sales by 27 per cent last year to Pounds 662m.
The Walt Disney version of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book appeared in video
form last October. By Christmas it had sold 4.9m copies, making it Britain's
best-selling video. Jungle Book provided a substantial boost to what the
industry calls 'sell-through' - outright sale of videos as opposed to
rental.
Jungle Book and several other Disney stories helped children's videos to
capture 37 per cent of the UK market, overtaking feature-film videos for the
first time. The viewers might have been children, but the buyers were
parents who first saw many of the films in the cinema when they were
children.
Jungle Book made its cinema debut in 1968. Disney's Peter Pan, another of
last year's best-selling videos, first appeared in the cinema in 1953. Other
best-sellers, all Disney products, were Beauty and the Beast and The Muppet
Christmas Carol.
The British Video Association said 60m videos were sold last year, 25 per
cent more than in 1992. This means the number of videos sold exceeded music
cassette sales for the first time. The number of cassettes sold last year
was 55.7m. Video sales are, however, still some way behind compact discs,
which sold 92.2m last year.
Ms Lavinia Carey, the association's director-general, said: 'Long gone are
the days when the video industry could be regarded as a poor relation of the
cinema or record industry. It has grown up much faster than its elders and
there is no reason to think this will not continue.'
The association said feature films accounted for 35 per cent of the video
market, with The Bodyguard, starring Kevin Costner, at the top of the list.
Videos of television programmes accounted for 10 per cent. Sport and fitness
videos made up 5 per cent of sales, with Cher Fitness topping the charts.
Music videos accounted for 4.5 per cent of sales, with the Manchester band
Take That producing the best-seller.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Appeal court upholds college strike ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld a controversial High Court ruling which
means that in future trade unions are likely to have to give employers the
names of all members participating in strike ballots.
The decision drew strong protests from union leaders who complained of an
attack on civil liberties.
As a result of the ruling by Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, next
Tuesday's one-day strike at 355 colleges of further education was called off
by Natfhe, the college lecturers' union. The union has been in dispute for
more than a year over the introduction of flexible contracts.
On Thursday Mr Justice Morison granted an injunction to Blackpool and the
Fylde College banning the strike because college employers had not been
given the names of union members being balloted.
That decision was based on a change to the 1992 Trade Union and Labour
Relations Act, which became law last summer, stating that a union must
'describe the employees of the employer' whom it is reasonable for the union
to believe will be entitled to vote in the ballot.
Trades Union Congress and union officials say government ministers had
indicated that the purpose of the clause was to prevent unions from
surprising large employers over which groups of workers they planned to call
out on strike, and that it was not about the naming of individuals.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the
decision was a further infringement of the civil liberties of union members
and would ensure that the government was embarrassed by public censure from
the International Labour Organisation at its conference in June.
In practice the decision is unlikely to be much more than a bureaucratic
chore for unions, most of whom have the names and addresses of members on
computer. Yet union officials say that naming those balloted invites
pressure from employers and could involve a civil liberties issue where
unions are not recognised and an employer does not know who is in the union.

tougher financial targets, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister,
announced yesterday.
The service's cost-recovery target for 1994-95 is being raised from 55 per
cent to 63 per cent, with the rest covered by the government. The service
will consolidate its 15 consultancy centres into seven units to meet this
target.
The move will involve closing 18 local offices and will cut costs by 10 per
cent.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Fly-in estate plans rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A planning application for what would have been the UK's first fly-in
community was rejected yesterday by Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary.
The scheme, called Skypark and based on an airstrip north of Telford,
Shropshire, provided for 65 expensive homes, each with a plot of 1.5 acres
and its own light-aircraft hangar, air traffic control buildings and a
country club. The airstrip would also have been used for business aviation.
The Department of the Environment cited loss of agricultural land, intrusion
into open countryside and unacceptable noise levels as reasons for rejecting
the plan.
Its decision followed a public inquiry last year and overturned planning
permission given by Wrekin District Council in 1992. The council believed
the plan would create jobs. Mr Phil Davis, chairman of the council's
planning committee, said: 'The decision is inconsistent with the accepted
role of Telford as a national and regional growth point.'

FT  26 FEB 94 / National pay deal for print industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions and employers in the printing industry have concluded a new national
agreement only a year after abandoning national bargaining, David Goodhart
writes.
The British Printing Industry Federation said that agreement had been
reached on an increase of Pounds 5 a week for a skilled worker and Pounds
4.65 and Pounds 4.43 for less skilled employees.
The GPMU print union calculates that the increase will represent a rise of
about 3 per cent for most print workers.
The deal introduces full flexibility between employees in grades previously
covered by the NGA craft union and those covered by the Sogat general union.
It covers about 100,000 employees.

FT  26 FEB 94 / MPs to disclose Lloyd's interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public will gain access to more details of MPs' involvement at the
Lloyd's of London insurance market next week.
The new directory of members' interests to be published on Monday will
disclose which MPs are Names - the individuals who provide assets supporting
insurance market - and for the first time give details of which syndicates
they support.
The directory will not, however, provide details of how much capacity the
MPs provide to each of their syndicates, nor of their stop-loss insurance -
a personal reinsurance policy which limits possible loss.
On the basis of the information contained in the directory it will be
impossible to determine the exact extent of the MPs' exposure to losses.
A number of Tory MPs are known to be members of loss-making syndicates and
will be affected by the market's expected Pounds 2bn overall loss for 1991.
According to the blue book, a Lloyd's publication which has a restricted
circulation, at least 15 MPs were members of syndicates in the 1991 year.
Among them are Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, a member of
loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates who has campaigned on behalf of
loss-making Names, and Mr Peter Viggers, MP for Gosport, a member of the
Lloyd's governing council.
Last year Lloyd's described reports that Tory MPs might be forced into
bankruptcy by their losses at Lloyd's as 'completely misleading'.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Gardiner to face 92 Group contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Gardiner, Conservative MP for Reigate, is to be challenged as
chairman of the rightwing 92 Group.
With nominations for next month's elections due to have been submitted by
last night, MPs familiar with the process said Sir Anthony Durant, the MP
for Reading West, was expected to emerge as Sir George's principal
challenger. Ballot papers will be sent out next week.
The challenge follows group members' vociferous condemnation of the way a
meeting with Mr John Major was handled, after the prime minister had been
angered by publicity suggesting that he was being offered terms for his
survival as leader.
A delegation of 92 Group MPs emerged chastened from Mr Major's Commons
office within minutes of arriving to demand urgent changes, although Sir
George insisted that it was not 'a brush off'.
The very fact that an election is being held could be interpreted as a sign
of diminished confidence in Sir George, as ballots are held only at members'
discretion.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Labour row over poll candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour party workers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, yesterday accused the
party's national executive committee of betraying the principles of
one-member-one-vote by refusing to consider a popular local candidate to
stand in the town's forthcoming by-election.
Members of Rotherham's constituency Labour party said they were 'up in arms'
over an NEC decision to draw up a short-list of candidates for the
by-election without including Mr Peter Thirlwall. He was recently nominated
as candidate by party members in five of the constituency's eight wards, and
by a majority of local union branches.
In accordance with Labour's rules the preliminary nominations were followed
by interviews with a sub-committee of the NEC, which this week drew up a
short-list on which the party can make its final vote.
The sub-committee, which included Miss Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader,
and Miss Hilary Armstrong, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John Smith,
drew up a list of six candidates that did not include Mr Thirlwall. Among
those chosen were Mr Denis MacShane, a well-known Labour party figure and
veteran trade unionist.
The NEC gave no reason for its decision to exclude Mr Thirlwall, who claims
to belong to the party's mainstream.
Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, said that each member of the
short-list 'must be able to withstand the pressures which come from the
national attention which will be given to this by-election'. The six
individuals chosen had met the required criteria.
Mr Thirlwall, an engineer with Rotherham Borough Council, said yesterday
that he would easily have won the final ballot had he been nominated, and
that this might have deprived the executive of pushing through a more
favoured candidate.
Ms Georgina Boyes, a member of the executive of the Rotherham constituency
Labour party, said the decision had caused anguish among party members.
She said: 'I think it's important that, having chosen OMOV as the main way
of selecting candidates, the whole process should be considered carefully.
Local wishes must be taken into account. The process is open to abuse.'
Ms Boyes said that a recent meeting of the CLP's executive had voted
overwhelmingly to demand Mr Thirlwall's inclusion in the final short-list.
'Ninety per cent of the executive are up in arms, if not more,' she said.
Mr Whitty said last night that the NEC's decision was final.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Independent set to back Mirror's bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the Independent and Independent
on Sunday newspapers, are poised to recommend to shareholders a takeover bid
from a consortium led by Mirror Group Newspapers.
The recommendation is likely to come on Monday, provided some remaining
details can be hammered out at the weekend between the committee of
independent directors and the consortium.
The consortium, which holds more than 47 per cent of Newspaper Publishing,
includes El Pais of Spain, La Repubblica of Italy, and a group which founded
the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor-in-chief.
The consortium raised its bid last weekend from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a
mixture of cash and MGN shares valuing the company at Pounds 73.65m. The bid
was raised to match the sum paid earlier this month by Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspapers of Ireland for 24.99 per cent of the company.
Mr O'Reilly has subsequently raised his stake in Newspaper Publishing to
29.99 per cent, subject to approval from the Department of Trade and
Industry, and is the single biggest shareholder. He has so far been denied
representation on the board, however.
The consortium is arguing that access to MGN's production facilities and
sharing of overheads will provide benefits to both businesses.
National Union of Journalist members at the newspapers fear that, if the bid
is successful, there will be heavy job losses and editorial independence
will be under threat.
The consortium has assured the independent directors that editorial
integrity will be 'sacrosanct'.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Straw welcomes extensive local gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour holds the largest number of council seats in England for the first
time ever, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Straw said a dossier compiled by Labour showed that the Conservatives had
lost 541 council seats in England since February last year, when Mr John
Major, the prime minister, called for a 'renaissance' in local government to
bring back Conservative values.
The dossier shows that the Tory losses have occurred in every region of
England and in every tier of local government.
Mr Straw said Labour held 7,543 council seats, compared with 7,408 for the
Conservatives. He added that local councils had lost power to an increasing
number of quangos.
The dossier shows that Labour controls 56 of the 124 major spending
authorities in England, and is the largest party in two-thirds of
authorities.
Labour controls the three main local government associations, including the
district and county council organisations, which have traditionally had
Conservative majorities.
The dossier sets the stage for the local elections in May, in which the
Conservatives are widely expected to lose further seats.
It demonstrates that Labour's effective grip on local government will make
it difficult for the party to make sweeping gains.
The dossier accuses the government of creating a powerful array of quangos
which form 'an unelected, unaccountable state which is now almost as large
as elected government'.
It says that quangos control Pounds 24bn of annual public spending which was
formerly controlled or influenced by local government. Much of the transfer
had been in education, transport, urban development, health and training.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Oil executive fined Pounds 120,000 for BCCI fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil, was fined
Pounds 120,000 at the Old Bailey yesterday after being convicted of
conspiring to inflate fraudulently the profits of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International by Dollars 90m.
Mr Baqi was found guilty on six counts of conspiring to furnish false
information but acquitted on a further two similar charges. The judge
ordered him to pay Pounds 50,000 towards the prosecution costs and Pounds
70,000 towards his legal aid.
Judge Neil Denison, explaining why he was not jailing Mr Baqi, said the
businessman had been used by more powerful men in BCCI and they had escaped
justice. Mr Baqi had neither sought personal gain nor intended to cause loss
to the depositors of the collapsed bank, he said. The judge made no order to
disqualify Mr Baqi from being a company director.
The conviction is the second successful prosecution brought so far by the
Serious Fraud Office over the collapse of BCCI. Mr Sayed Ali Akbar, a former
head of BCCI's international treasury division, was jailed for six years
last September after confessing to 16 charges of false accounting involving
Dollars 746m.
During Mr Baqi's trial the prosecution outlined how he conspired with senior
members of BCCI to help them perpetrate the bank's multi-billion dollar
international fraud by signing false audit-confirmation requests and letters
confirming that Attock Oil owed management fees to the bank.
The prosecution said the effect of these was to confirm to Price Waterhouse,
the BCCI auditors, that the bank was owed Dollars 90m by Attock Oil, so
creating a false impression of the bank's profitability.
The prosecution said the main perpetrator of this part of the overall BCCI
fraud was Mr Basheer Chowdry, a former manager with the bank's UK
operations, with whom the Attock Oil head had regular dealings.
Mr Chowdry had left for Pakistan after the collapse of the bank in June 1991
and was now out of reach of the British authorities, the court was told.
Lawyers for Mr Baqi said during the trial that he had been made a scapegoat
for the collapse of the bank and they questioned why he had been prosecuted
when staff from both Price Waterhouse and the Bank of England had failed to
act when the signs of fraud had started to emerge.
During cross-examination one Price Waterhouse witness admitted that his firm
had failed always to use best-practice methods when auditing the BCCI books.
Mr Baqi left court yesterday without commenting. He intends to return
permanently to his native Pakistan.

FT  26 FEB 94 / BR safety attacked over tunnel rail crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail's safety procedures are strongly criticised in a report
published yesterday on the collision in the Severn rail tunnel which injured
185 passengers.
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive says that the accident
in December 1991 could have been avoided, even though its precise cause is
uncertain. A regional Sprinter train ran into a London to Cardiff train in
the 4.4-mile tunnel under the Severn estuary.
The report also condemns BR's implementation of its emergency plan.
Mr Robin Seymour, chief inspecting officer of railways who conducted the
inquiry, says that after the 1988 Clapham Junction accident in London, when
35 people were killed, BR committed itself to a policy of total quality
management. 'It is disturbing to find so little evidence of its effects in
practice here,' he says.
He does not suggest managers and staff were negligent. But because the
tunnel had had only two minor accidents in over a century 'the possibility
of an emergency received too little attention amidst other pressing
priorities'.
He says the accident was caused either by 'an unaccountable error' by the
Sprinter driver, or by the signalling and telecommunications technicians in
the tunnel junction relay room.
BR said yesterday it accepted the findings and was overhauling the tunnel's
safety.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Tories' battlegrounds to be tax and councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives yesterday signalled that taxation policy and local
government corruption will be the main battleground in the forthcoming local
and European elections.
The Conservative tactics were flagged in hard-hitting speeches by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, and Mr Peter Brooke,
heritage secretary.
Labour was surprised by the attacks, which carried the campaign to what is
regarded as opposition territory.
The Conservative tactics reflect the government's determination in the
elections to limit its losses, which are expected to be extensive.
Mr Clarke told businessmen in Maidstone: 'The Conservative party is willing
to fight on the low-taxation issue any time and anywhere. We did last time,
we will next time, the time after that and the time after that.'
The chancellor defended the public-spending cuts in the November Budget and
insisted that he had raised taxes 'only with great reluctance'.
His message was aimed largely at convincing voters that the Conservative
party remains committed to low taxes. 'Our answer to those who ask 'Will
taxes ever go down again?' is: 'Yes, provided we control public spending','
he said.
He said Labour had tried 'to misuse statistics in a ridiculous way to try to
revive the old myth that we tax the poor but not the rich'.
Conservative officials said the thrust of Mr Clarke's speech would be
pressed home today by the prime minister at the Conservative local
government conference in London.
Sir Norman told a conference dinner that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
was heading a 'disreputable' campaign of 'smear, smear and smear again'
against Tory councils.
He accused Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, of making
unproven allegations against Tory-run Westminster council, which was accused
of gerrymandering in a recent district auditor's report. Sir Norman said
Labour councils were responsible for the 10 highest council taxes in band C.
Mr Brooke, MP for the City and Westminster South, praised Westminster
council's services, which compared favourably with neighbouring
Labour-controlled boroughs.

Will Carling, England's rugby captain, yesterday rang the bell at the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange to signal the start of
trading in the FT-SE Mid-250 index futures contract, Joel Kibazo writes. The
new contract is a rival to the Mid-250 futures contract which started
trading on the screen-based OMLX exchange three weeks ago. One dealer said
the Mid-250's first day of trading, with a total of 617 contracts dealt, had
been 'slightly disappointing'.
Next to Mr Carling is Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe chairman, and immediately in
front of him is Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the exchange, who said
the contract would enable investors to manage their exposure to all of the
UK's 350.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Companies run the rule over regulator: Alison Smith reports
on the cautious reaction by the financial services sector to the Personal
Investment Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than a week after the publication of detailed plans for the new retail
financial services regulator, the first completed application forms have
already landed.
TSB Group, the UK's sixth-largest bank, has expressed its intention to join,
and Standard Life has said that it is likely to do so in spite of its
preference for a full-blown statutory system of regulation.
But in spite of such encouraging signs there has been no concerted rush by
independent financial advisers, life insurance companies, banks and building
societies to stand up and be counted as friends of the Personal Investment
Authority.
Indeed, the call from Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar and Eagle
Star, two of the UK's largest insurance companies, for a period of
consultation, suggests that he thinks many in the financial services sector
are uneasy about the proposals.
Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, insists that reaction has been more positive
than merely grudging acceptance. 'People have been reassured to some extent
by what they've seen in the prospectus,' he says. He acknowledges, however,
that he cannot expect instant enthusiasm.
'These are very important decisions. People will need to study the
documentation and then take the decision to their board. It's not a matter
for an off-the-cuff reaction.'
Many in the financial services industry would agree. There has been no word
yet from Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer. Legal &amp; General, another
leading life company, has made it clear it will not put its head above the
parapet.
Mr Michael Doerr, chief executive of Friends Provident, says he is
disappointed with what he has seen in the prospectus so far although he has
not ruled out the possibility of his company applying. The question will not
go before the board until its meeting at the end of the month.
Mr Palmer agrees that the prospectus can set out only aims and methods, and
cannot provide conclusive evidence of how the PIA will operate. He says:
'The most important early test will be the effectiveness of the admission
process.'
However, the PIA has set no clearly defined targets for how many of the
potential membership of 6,000 firms the organisation believes should fail
because they do not meet the higher standards it intends to set. The
development of training and competence standards in 1995 will be a further
sign of its own effectiveness. In the meantime 'there's the kind of
relationship we have with the industry, and disciplinary and other decisions
coming through'.
At this hesitant time, Mr Greener's proposal could act as a catalyst in
crystallising the concerns expressed by some in the industry. These have
focused on vagueness about how the PIA's committees will work and how they
will be formed, and disquiet that the extra cost of the new regulator may
not be reflected in higher standards.
Mr Greener suggests that the PIA should be made up of a 12-strong board of
public-interest directors, supervising an executive committee of 10 people
working in the industry 'who know the nuts and bolts of the selling
process'.
As a designated agency under the financial services legislation, it would be
scrutinised directly by parliament which would make recommendations to the
government on how it should act.
In drawing up plans on training and competence, the PIA would look not only
at what knowledge sales agents or advisers had of the subject and their
products, but their application of that knowledge in advice.
While there is some support for Mr Greener's blueprint, it appears no more
likely than the existing PIA prospectus to achieve a consensus support in a
sector where incompatible views about regulation are strongly held.
Only an immediate deadline seems capable of reconciling them.

British Rail's safety procedures are strongly criticised in a report
published yesterday on the collision in the Severn rail tunnel which injured
185 passengers.
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive says that the accident,
in December 1991, could have been avoided, even though its precise cause is
uncertain.
The report also condemns BR's implementation of its emergency plan which it
says went 'seriously wrong'. It took more than two hours for rescue services
to arrive and passengers 'all experienced an unpleasant and lengthy delay'.
In the accident, a regional Sprinter train ran into the rear of a London to
Cardiff train in the 4.4-mile Victorian tunnel under the Severn estuary.
There were 302 people on the two trains. The Sprinter's driver was seriously
injured, as were five of the passengers.
Mr Robin Seymour, chief inspecting officer of railways who conducted the
inquiry, says that after the 1988 Clapham Junction accident in London, when
35 people were killed, BR committed itself to a policy of total quality
management. 'It is disturbing to find so little evidence of its effects in
practice here,' he says.
He does not suggest railway managers and staff were negligent. But he says
that, because the tunnel had had only two minor accidents in more than a
century, 'the possibility of an emergency received too little attention
amidst other pressing priorities.
'A systematic approach to the identification, management and monitoring of
hazards, which BR has adopted in principle, could have checked all these
errors and prevented the accident.'
He concludes it was caused either by 'an unaccountable error' on the part of
the Sprinter driver, or by the signalling and telecommunications technicians
in the tunnel junction relay room. The driver, Mr Stephen Carpenter, did not
give evidence to the inquiry after legal advice.
Mr Seymour says that although the agreed plan for dealing with emergencies
was broadly satisfactory, 'the state of preparedness . . . failed to meet
the expectations of the professional emergency services'. The location of
the crash was not properly communicated at first and most of the BR rescue
team's radio pagers failed.
He makes 11 recommendations. BR said yesterday it accepted the inquiry's
findings and was overhauling the tunnel's safety at a cost of more than
Pounds 6.5m. The improvements were 'well advanced'.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: Companies fear losing a shop window
 -Impact on Britain / Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British
companies in protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John
Major's government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau
dam affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth
of the troubles now facing UK companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Malaysian government's boycott of British goods has caused widespread
alarm among UK companies. The main threat, however, seems largely confined
to three industries: construction, defence and power generation.
For the UK economy as a whole, the sums involved are fairly small. Malaysian
government's imports of British goods total about Pounds 500m (Dollars
742.5m) a year, or less than 0.5 per cent of total UK visible exports.
However, UK companies also undertake several billion pounds worth of
contract work in Malaysia on projects which range from power plants to
airfields. More important, some British companies argue that Malaysia is an
important shop window for their activities in the fast-growing and crucially
important Asia-Pacific market.
Officially, the ban on British goods extends only to government orders, with
the private sector left free to buy as it chooses. However, British
companies with experience of the region are nervous that the private sector
might follow the government's lead.
Construction companies are alarmed at the prospect of being excluded from
one of Britain's biggest Far East construction markets outside Hong Kong.
British contractors are working on projects worth more than Pounds 1bn in
Malaysia. Orders worth several times this amount are in the pipeline. The
largest is the new Pounds 3bn Kuala Lumpur international airport.
Other construction contracts pending include Pounds 500m of rural water
projects (North West Water has already won a Pounds 1.25bn contract
involving the privatisation of the country's waste water system); the Pounds
400m Sultan Salahuddin thermal power station in the south of the country; a
Pounds 160m steelworks at Gunawan: and several hundred million pounds of
road contracts, including some privately financed tolled motorway sections.
Taylor Woodrow has previously advised on the private financing of sections
of the strategic north-south highway. Costain, which has no contracts in
Malaysia, said yesterday that it was bidding for a Dollars 120m section of
the country's east-west highway. It was bidding for other work in the
country worth Dollars 1.3bn including Dollars 500m worth of work on the new
airport.
Both Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House are involved in the controversial
Pounds 417m Pergau contract which is being built by a consortium of
Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty from the UK and Kerjayah, a Malaysian
company.
Trafalgar House regards Malaysia as an important base to break into other
south-east Asian markets. It is in the process of establishing a steel
fabrication plant in a joint venture with Edaran Otomobil Nasional to supply
steel for construction to the region.
The next largest construction project under way and involving a British
contractor is the first phase of a privately financed light rail system
linking Kuala Lumpur with surrounding areas. Finance for the first phase,
which will operate under a franchise from the Malay government, has been
raised by Taylor Woodrow, the UK contractor, and AEG Westinghouse of
Germany.
Construction began last year and the project is unlikely to be affected by
the Malaysian government's ruling.
UK companies involved in the Malaysian power market expressed disappointment
at the Kuala Lumpur government's decision, but said they were hopeful the
issue could be resolved.
There was relief, too, that the new policy would not apply to private
Malaysian companies. Independent power plant (IPP) projects are increasingly
important in Malaysia and other Asian markets. In these, the power station
is built, owned and normally operated by private companies.
British Gas pointed out that the deal it signed last year in relation to a
720MW power plant joint venture near Kuala Lumpur was with a private
company, Genting Sanyen Power.
Rolls-Royce, which last year completed a Pounds 70m expansion and rebuild of
the Connaught Bridge power station near Kuala Lumpur, said it had a long and
valued association with Malaysia and was disappointed by the decision not to
entertain new contracts from UK companies. Only this week, Rolls-Royce
clinched a deal to form a 50-50 joint venture with EPE Power, a private
Malaysian company, to meet the growing demand for power transmission
equipment in Malaysia.
John Brown, Trafalgar House's engineering business, has two large contracts
for power stations which it is building for Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the
quasi-state utility. These are apparently unaffected by the government's
decision, but Trafalgar House said a big question mark had been placed over
the possibility of future business.
After winning a Pounds 120m contract last September for a 330MW gas turbine
power station at Pasir Gudang, John Brown made clear it hoped to win further
business in Malaysia, a market well suited to the fast-track, mid-sized
stations in which the UK company specialises.
John Laing, the UK construction group, recently acquired a 5 per cent stake
in YTL Power Generation, which has been contracted to build and operate two
privately financed power stations in Malaysia costing a combined MDollars
3.5bn. Laing has been appointed project manager for building and civil
engineering works of the two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at
Pasir Gudang and Paka.
Last year British consultants worked on Malaysian construction projects
worth Pounds 2.74bn representing 5 per cent of consultants' total overseas
work and generating fees of Pounds 30m, according to the Association of
Consulting Engineers.
Among British defence contractors, British Aerospace yesterday said it was
taking part in newspaper advertisements 'to demonstrate that we are
supportive of Anglo-Malaysian relations and want to build up this
relationship'. BAe said it did not support 'the ill-informed and tendentious
reports in the UK press'.
BAe has won some Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m worth of defence business in
Malaysia, its third biggest defence export market after Saudi Arabia and
Indonesia. Last week, it delivered the first of a batch of 28 Hawk
fighter/trainer aircraft to Malaysia. Under the 1988
government-to-government agreement on defence equipment, for which GEC is
the prime contractor, BAe supplies the Seawolf ship to air missiles
incorporated in two frigates ordered from GEC Yarrow.
Mr Alan Jones, chairman of the Westland helicopter group, said: 'We consider
Malaysia is a good place to do business.' We want to work with Malaysia
because it has high-quality people and the economy is going very well. It is
an attractive place to do business,' he added.
BAA, the privatised UK airports group, has acted as a consultant on the
master-planning of the Sepang international airport.
BAA said: 'We were hoping that there would be future business opportunities
and we felt we were in a good position to bid for future contracts.'

Is the British government fumbling away the prospects for UK business in the
world's most dynamic economies?
The nerves of British businessmen who see European, Japanese and US
counterparts forging ahead in Asia, often with substantial collaboration
from their governments, can only have become more frayed after a week in
which official relations with Malaysia and China have dramatically
deteriorated.
The announcement yesterday that British companies will not be considered for
Malaysian government contracts comes hard on the heels of warnings from
Beijing over its future with UK business. China stopped short of imposing
sanctions but it has said UK business is bound to be affected by the dispute
over Hong Kong, which deepened further this week.
Although the performance of British companies has lacked lustre in some
parts of Asia, here are two countries in which they have been doing well and
have been well-positioned to make further progress. In both countries their
efforts have been supported by high-level government trade missions as part
of the policy of Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and
industry, to co-ordinate more closely with business in boosting exports and
investment.
Britain's colonial heritage appears to be both a blessing and a curse in its
efforts to participate in Asia's rapid growth. On the one hand, it has given
many British companies experience and contacts in the region. On the other,
it has left a legacy of sensitivity to the former imperial power.
Mainly thanks to Hong Kong, UK and UK-linked companies have a reasonably
strong and growing presence in China, which is seen by companies around the
world as the country in which they must not miss out because of its size and
extraordinary potential.
But China's deep suspicion of London's ulterior motives has been obvious
throughout the negotiations over Hong Kong, even after reversion of
sovereignty to Beijing was sealed in the 1984 Joint Declaration. Chinese
officials see the proposals of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, as an
attempt to perpetuate Britain's influence after the 1997 handover.
The accounts of last year's 17 fruitless rounds of talks on Mr Patten's
plans show the negotiations to have been a dialogue of the deaf. The
fundamental differences in the starting positions of the two sides made
concessions by either side futile.
However, many businesspeople in Hong Kong and Britain believe that Mr Patten
and the British government have unnecessarily provoked China through a
combative approach. They doubt the usefulness of Mr Patten's stance, given
that Hong Kong business is already adjusting itself to Chinese sovereignty
regardless of politics, and that Beijing says it will reverse his reforms
anyway. The Hong Kong business community appears unconvinced by the argument
that free and fair elections will be the best underpinning for Hong Kong's
continued commercial success.
It especially feels that the British government's effort to make an
honourable exit from Hong Kong will not have been worth it if it
substantially weakens Britain's longer-term prospects in China.
The Malaysian dispute is very different, not least because of the strong UK
governmental involvement in the private-sector contracts involved, whether
through defence or official financing. If the colonial legacy is an
exacerbating factor, it lies in Malaysia's persistent sensitivity to what it
sees as the west's attempts to impose its own standards on the developing
world.
Since Malaysia's independence from British rule, Britain's fortunes there
have fluctuated. Statutory teaching of English, once banned, has been
re-instituted. UK companies were warmly welcomed after the ending of the Buy
British Last campaign in the 1980s but now may be frozen out again. Nor is
Britain the only country to have fallen out with Dr Mahathir.
Kuala Lumpur must have difficulty understanding how governmental deals which
clearly benefited both sides have become so exposed to public scrutiny. The
agreements were of the sort which south-east Asian governments understand,
in which governments and private-sector companies - with or without links to
ruling parties of long standing - operate effectively as one entity in
forwarding the national interest.
London's attempts to explain the agreements will have been as unimpressive
in Kuala Lumpur as they have been in Britain.
Yesterday's move by Kuala Lumpur will leave British companies nervous not
only about their prospects in Malaysia but also about the impact of the
present dispute in other south-east Asian countries in which they seek
infrastructural contracts which need involvement by governments.
They will wonder how well-equipped is the government in London to promote
and then to defend their interests.

The government's handling of the Pergau dam project came under sustained
attack in the House of Commons yesterday, with Labour blaming ministers for
the decision to ban British companies from bidding for Malaysian government
business.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said it was because of the
government's conduct that Britain now faced 'these very serious
consequences.'
He said Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had denied there was any
link between Pergau and a Malaysian arms deal - 'a statement we now know to
be untrue.'
In fact, at the same time as British companies were engaged in discussions
about Pergau, some of the same companies were discussing aspects of the arms
deal, Mr Cunningham said.
'Is the country expected to believe that expenditure of Pounds  1/4 bn of
taxpayers' money was being promised to a government at the same time as an
arms deal was being negotiated with that government and there was no link
between them?', he asked.
It would never be possible to build a successful economy on 'squalid if not
illegal' deals like this one.
Sir David Steel, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the 'blast
and blather' from Malaysia suggested that they 'may have something to hide.'
The Malaysian government's objections were to British press stories about
funds allegedly paid by British contractors into Swiss bank accounts on
behalf of Malaysian politicians, he said. No MP was in a position to know
whether or not these were true.
Concern on the Tory backbenches focused on the possible consequences of
yesterday's move on British jobs.
Mr Michael Jopling, a former minister, said many in British industry would
be 'totally perplexed' to find their jobs put at risk because of the
activities of a free press.
Mr Michael Shersby, a Tory member of the public accounts committee, said
there was nothing illegal in the Pergau deal.
Mr Hurd had pressed on with the transaction 'because he did not wish to
renege on undertakings' given to Malaysia by Lady Thatcher when she was
prime minister.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office minister, said relations with Malaysia
would 'undoubtedly have been damaged' if Britain had backed out of the deal.
Mr Hurd had looked at the project in the light of commitments to continue to
assist Malaysian development and the wider context of bilateral relations
between the two countries. It was the government's task to promote the
national interest, including exports and jobs.
Mr Goodlad said there was no good reason for the Malaysians to make a
connection between British press reporting and the conduct of trade.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: MPs will press investigation

government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam
affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of
the troubles now facing UK companies

UK businessmen and the Malaysian government have been united in complaining
about British press coverage of the Pergau dam affair in recent days.
But despite their protestations, the British media and MPs will continue to
press Mr John Major's government on an issue they regard as having
legitimate public interest.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will next Wednesday be
cross-examined on Britain's aid for the Pergau dam by the House of Commons
Foreign Affairs Committee.
MPs will quiz Mr Hurd on his decision in July 1991 to approve a Pounds 234m
grant to the Malaysian government for the hydro-electric dam - the largest
sum for a single scheme under the Overseas Development Administration's Aid
and Trade Provision - against the advice of the civil servant in charge of
aid policy.
More crucially, they want to find out whether, in their zeal to win defence
contracts with Malaysia, ministers broke foreign office guidelines
prohibiting the linking of aid to arms sales.
The UK grant for the dam had been negotiated at around the same time as a
Pounds 1bn defence package was signed by Lady Thatcher, then prime minister,
and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
The package, which includes sales by GEC and British Aerospace, remains
shrouded in secrecy but it is thought to include the supply of fighter
aircraft and the construction of military command and logistics centres.
Mr Hurd said yesterday the aid and defence deals had been briefly
'entangled' for three months in 1988, and were 'then pursued separately.'
GEC also said yesterday there was no linkage between the defence deal and
Pergau, even though it has a share of both contracts.
Questions about the deal were first raised last October when the National
Audit Office, the government's accountancy watchdog, issued a report on the
project. It revealed that ODA officials had concluded that on commercial
terms, the Pergau project was 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian
consumers.
The NAO said that funding arrangements chosen by the government would add at
least Pounds 56m to the aid provided by the UK taxpayer over the 14-year
life of the project. It would also mean Malaysians paying Pounds 100m more
in electricity costs than cheaper alternatives.
Since then, the foreign office has admitted that before Lady Thatcher
concluded the defence deal, her then defence secretary Lord Younger signed a
protocol in March 1988 which - in the foreign office's words - 'briefly
linked arms and aid.' It is understood that in the protocol aid was offered
as a specific percentage of the defence deal.
Downing Street officials said last week this was an 'unfortunate error' by
officials advising Lord Younger. Mr Hurd has repeatedly claimed that the
deals were 'delinked' within three months, and that Malaysia was informed
that there could be no formal package encompassing the two.
Nevertheless members of the FAC want to ask Mr Hurd several questions next
week:
Is it credible to say that the deals were 'delinked' just because they were
not formally pursued in a single package?
Why did Mr John Major, as prime minister, give the final go-ahead for
cheques for the project to be signed in February 1991?
Is there any connection between the securing of the defence deal and the
issue of public interest immunity certificates preventing the release of
foreign office telexes in the trial of Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian
businessman?
Members of the FAC have asked to see the full text of a letter sent to Dr
Mahathir on August 8 1988 by Baroness Thatcher. She confirmed the aid deal,
but foreign office officials say that at the end of the letter she 'looked
forward to Dr Mahathir's visit to Britain in September 1988, when she hoped
that the memorandum of understanding on the defence package could be
signed.'
It is also understood that Baroness Thatcher sent memoranda to Lord Younger
and other ministers in the spring of 1988 raising deep concern over the
linkage of the deals. How much light do these throw on the decisions that
were finally taken?
The overriding political issue will be the extent to which foreign policy
factors as well as wider commercial considerations overrode aid policy, and
where in the final analysis the UK national interest lay.
The Malaysian government has argued that it was an important project as part
of their programme to diversify their sources of electric power. BICC and
Trafalgar House, the lead contractors on Pergau, also argue that the project
will prove economically viable in the longer term.
Mr Hurd's defence is that the deal was crucial in getting a more favourable
trading relationship for the UK and Malaysia. He has also argued that he had
no choice but to stand by commitments made by previous ministers in Baroness
Thatcher's government.

To many in the west, Dr Mahathir Mohamad might seem a maverick. The
Malaysian prime minister's action against Britain might seem out of
proportion to the offence Malaysia says the British media has committed.
Dr Mahathir has made outspoken attacks on the west on a range of issues. He,
and Malaysia generally, have gained a reputation as difficult to deal with.
Dr Mahathir does not care.
'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be famous,' said Dr Mahathir
recently. But at the same time the Malaysian prime minister has shown
himself sensitive to criticism.
Despite Dr Mahathir's firm grip on power, reports do circulate of large
scale financial scandals and pay-offs. A government anti-corruption agency
is widely perceived as ineffective.
Politics and business are closely interlinked in Malaysia: Dr Mahathir's
United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant political party in
Malaysia, exercises enormous power over the corporate sector.
Foreign companies operating in Malaysia find that connections are all
important to winning business deals. The concept of conflicts of interest
between state and corporate sectors rarely applies.
But behind Dr Mahathir's attacks on the west, there is another message:
Malaysia, and other fast developing countries in east Asia, are growing
increasingly intolerant of what they consider to be the patronising and
arrogant behaviour of the west.
'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that developing countries,
including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their
own affairs successfully,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, deputy prime minister,
yesterday.
Malaysia's economy has grown more than 8 per cent in each of the past six
years. The Kuala Lumpur stock exchange is one of the biggest in east Asia.
Malaysia makes its own cars and is a leading computer parts manufacturer.
Economic success has bred confidence, some would say arrogance. Dr Mahathir
believes in strong leadership. He rejects western ideas of press freedom. He
attacks western attitudes on human rights questions. He rails against what
he perceives to be - as in this instance - interference in Malaysia's
internal affairs.
Dr Mahathir has some powerful supporters. Indonesia and Singapore and China
would have very similar views.
Within Malaysia the prime minister probably has more to gain than lose from
this fracas. While Dr Mahathir is perhaps not liked by all Malaysians he is
respected by many. They see him as the great moderniser - the man who has
propelled the country towards industrialisation and greater prosperity.
The Malaysian opposition is small and ineffective. But it has created some
government angst by questioning senior officials about British media
allegations of corruption in high places.
The Malaysian media is very carefully controlled and the message that Dr
Mahathir, and the Malaysian people, have been insulted by the British press
is being pressed home.
With general elections likely this year, Dr Mahathir might be hoping the
move against Britain will rally domestic political support. But this should
not be overemphasised. Dr Mahathir's national front coalition would appear
certain of victory in any poll.
Dr Mahathir is not a man for turning. It took more than six years for
Britain to persuade the Malaysian leader to change his 'Buy British Last'
policy of the early 80s. A personal friendship which developed between Dr
Mahathir and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, was
largely responsible for healing ties.
But Dr Mahathir and Mr Major are not close. Mr Major was angered by a
forthright attack on British policy on Bosnia made by Dr Mahathir during a
visit to Kuala Lumpur late last year. Bosnia is a subject on which Dr
Mahathir holds very strong views: little common ground seems to exist
between the two leaders.
It is very difficult to see how relations can be brought back to normal.
Yesterday Mr Anwar said he was not expecting or seeking any apologies from
the British government. He seemed at a loss to suggest what could be done.
But he was clear that Malaysia would continue with its action against
British companies.

One Kuala Lumpur based British businessman had a straightforward reaction to
events of the last few days.
'It's terrible, terrible. Three years of negotiations down the drain. I'm
going to get drunk.'
It is hard to over-estimate the effect of yesterday's Malaysian government
action against British companies. Over the past six years, Malaysia has been
a honeypot for British business.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister who made
yesterday's announcement, said up to MDollars 16bn (Pounds 4bn) could be
affected by the move.
John Laing, the British construction and engineering company, has had its
regional HQ in Malaysia for the past eight years. With its Malaysian
partners Laing is involved in a Pounds 212m hospital building programme, a
Pounds 30m airport project in East Malaysia and has recently invested Pounds
12m in a power station project.
But Laing will now have to wave goodbye to possible multi million pound
contracts to build an extensive army barracks complex and a private
university complex in Kuala Lumpur. Negotiations on the barracks have been
going on for four years.
For Laing and companies like it, Malaysia was a shop window to the region.
Malaysia is a regional pioneer in build, operate, transfer contracts and in
privatising its power sector. British Gas, the National Grid, John Brown,
Rolls Royce and others had hoped to use their involvement in the Malaysian
power sector as a springboard in the world's fastest growing economic
region.
The most cruel blow has been dealt to the group of companies involved in the
Anglo- Japanese consortium working on a new MDollars 12bn (Pounds 3bn)
airport south of Kuala Lumpur. Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Gammon and
G-Mats (part of GEC) - in partnership with Marubeni of Japan had been
assured of the bulk of the work.
Yesterday Mr Anwar said the British companies involved had already been
informed that they would been awarded no further work on the project.
The airport, due to be completed before 1998 when Malaysia is due to host
the Commonwealth Games, could be delayed by the forced British withdrawal.
The cost could also rise. Malaysia does not seem concerned.
There are many grey areas in the midst of this fracas: Mr Anwar said
compensation would be paid in some instances and all existing contracts
would be honoured. But he said the Malaysian government was under no
obligation to abide by memorandums of understanding and letters of intent
with British companies.
However some contracts already signed are the first phase of more extensive
agreements. Mr Anwar said Malaysia would still be taking delivery of 28
British Aerospace Hawk aircraft - a deal which formed part of the
controversial 1988 MOU on defence sales agreed between Dr Mahathir and Mrs
Thatcher.
But question marks arise over a comprehensive maintenance and technology
transfer agreement allied to the Hawk contract. Clearly some agreements are
going to be very difficult to unwind.
Mr Anwar said only government contracts will be effected by the Malaysian
move, but many private deals are also likely to be in jeopardy.
Many of Malaysia's biggest companies - some involved in joint ventures with
British companies - are closely connected with Dr Mahathir's United Malays
National Organisation (UMNO), the country's dominant political party.
Britain does have some leverage: Malaysia exports well over Pounds 1bn worth
of goods to Britain each year and the trade surplus is substantially in
Malaysia's favour. Britain is the main export market for the Proton, the
Malaysian car manufactured in conjunction with Mitsubishi of Japan.
But confident in its own economic success, Malaysia is not concerned about
the fallout. When John Major visited Kuala Lumpur last September, he
announced that British companies were negotiating contracts worth Pounds 1bn
which could secure 25,000 UK jobs.
Mr Anwar's answer on those negotiations was unequivocal. 'Virtually all
those contracts will not be approved,' he said.

FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: Like Australia, Britain may be
forced to concede an apology - Previous rows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in protest at
reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's government by
surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam affair. FT
writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles
now facing UK companies
British officials displayed a stiff upper lip in response to Malaysia's
action yesterday.
Aides to Mr John Major, the prime minister, dismissed talk of retaliatory
sanctions, insisting it was 'far too early' to say how Britain might
respond.
'The British government does not tell the British press what to write, and
our trade relations with Malaysia really have nothing to do with what the
British press decides to print,' said a senior official.
However, Downing Street is uncomfortably aware that Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister, has placed successful bets on this course before.
Attention in Britain has focused on the 'Buy British Last' row in the early
1980s, when Malaysia instituted a near-boycott of UK goods in retaliation
for London's decision to end subsidies for foreign students.
The dispute was eventually ended after a long campaign for better relations
by Mrs Margaret Thatcher (now Baroness Thatcher), who was then the British
prime minister.
Lady Thatcher later described her close relationship with Dr Mahathir: 'I
hope that I am not presuming in describing him as a friend, whose counsel I
have found invaluable, as well as a very skilful and tough negotiator for
Malaysia's interests.'
But that row was over an issue of substance - the cost of sending Malaysian
students to London. The new row, triggered by Malaysian dislike of British
press reports, has more in common with two other disputes. which had
different endings.
The first blew up in 1990, when Dr Mahathir took offence over a fictional
drama series, called Embassy, broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC). The series, set in an Australian embassy in a fictional
south-east Asian country called Ragaan, was filmed in Fiji and did not
mention Malaysia.
Nevertheless, Dr Mahathir interpreted the programme as an insult to
Malaysians, and threatened to retaliate with a trade boycott against
Australia.
Initially, Mr Bob Hawke, then Australian prime minister, took a similar line
to Downing Street - that the government was not responsible for what the ABC
chose to broadcast.
But the row escalated until Mr Hawke went to Kuala Lumpur in 1991 to deliver
what was seen in Australia as a demeaning apology.
Last year Malaysia made life equally uncomfortable for Mr Hawke's successor,
Mr Paul Keating, who was unwise enough to describe Dr Mahathir as
'recalcitrant' for refusing to attend a Pacific Rim summit in Seattle. Dr
Mahathir imposed restrictions on contacts with Australia and hinted that he
might downgrade diplomatic relations. Again, the row was ended by an
Australian apology, reluctantly delivered by Mr Keating.
Then, as now, Dr Mahathir, chose to lay most of the blame on the media:
'Some newspapers made me out to be a difficult person and very unpopular and
that Malaysia was about to burst into racial violence,' he said. 'How can
Australia claim to be part of Asia when Australian journalists lack
manners?'
But Mr Keating eventually wrote a personal letter to Dr Mahathir and twice
publicly expressed regret for his remark. Nonetheless, it was felt in
Australia at the time that damage had been done to business confidence in
the relationship.
Aides to Mr John Major know that there would be great political dangers for
the British prime minister if he was forced to deliver anything approaching
an apology to end the row.
Whether Dr Mahathir will push the dispute that far is not clear. But his
brinkmanship with Australia shows his determination to avenge anything seen
as a slur. 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous,' he
said last year. 'In order to be known, you have to be nasty.'

Bertelsmann and KirchGroup, Germany's two largest investors in private
television, are to join Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications
monopoly, in a multimedia venture aimed at delivering interactive television
and other digital services to the home.
The three have signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint
venture called Media Service, which will offer to manage and distribute new
TV and telecommunications services on Deutsche Telekom's cable television
network.
Bertelsmann said the venture was the first step to a multimedia network that
could include customised programming, interactive television and other
services.
The venture plans to establish a single service company to distribute new
Pay-TV programmes, shopping-TV and other specialist channels on a ready-made
communication network which includes 14m homes in Germany.
Initial investment is expected to be around DM200m (Pounds 77.8m), and the
joint venture is intending to develop its own decoder system, so that it can
offer clients not only the cable distribution, but also a single
sophisticated billing system, charging viewers according to the service they
use.
Deutsche Telekom, soon to be privatised under legislation currently going
through the German parliament, is obviously keen to exploit its existing
cable network as the dominant means of distributing digital television and
specialist telecommunication services.
The alternatives to cable distribution of digital television would be
satellite distribution or terrestrial broadcasting, but Deutsche Telekom is
clearly keen to exploit its existing monopoly position in German cable TV.
Only in east Germany is there very low cable penetration in urban areas,
with satellite broadcasting filling the gap.
The deal brings together the Bertelsmann media empire, whose television
interests include RTL, Germany's most profitable private broadcaster, and
KirchGroup headed by Mr Leo Kirch, who is a leading shareholder in the SAT-1
station, and in the Axel Springer publishing group.
Although the two groups are normally fierce rivals, they are both
shareholders in Premiere pay-TV, whose technical expertise and marketing
skills - with some 800,000 subscribers - could be used in the venture.
All three companies were adamant yesterday that Media Services would be
scrupulously neutral in its treatment of future clients, restricting itself
to technical, administrative and distribution services.
'The new joint venture will not act as a broadcaster or provider of
programming,' they said in a statement. That commitment is intended to
ensure that the venture does not fall foul of Germany's strict controls over
the broadcasting market, which forbids any one company from a majority
shareholding in more than one station.
The three founders said they would also be happy to accept further
shareholders with minority stakes in the joint venture, which will be
founded on April 1. It will be based in Berlin, and is intended to start
operation by the middle of the year.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Fears of 'negotiating crunch' at enlargement talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ministerial talks on enlargement resumed in Brussels last night amid dimming
hopes that terms of entry into the European Union for Austria, Norway,
Sweden and Finland can be reached by the deadline of Monday midnight. 'There
is a genuine negotiating crunch coming' over this weekend, one EU ambassador
forecast yesterday.
Last night's talks centred on agriculture and fisheries. All but the Swedish
government are unhappy with EU proposals for long-term aid to Arctic and
Alpine farmers, which the applicants would largely have to fund themselves.
They are also opposed to immediate realignment of their far higher farm
prices to EU levels, and instead want border levies to iron out the price
difference. The European Commission and, so far, a majority of the 12, say
such frontier controls would compromise the border-free single market.
The UK argues that a 'big bang' on farm prices for the would-be members
could jeopardise the referendums on entry in three of the four applicant
countries. They forsee the EU having to pay too much of the compensation for
the farm price cuts.
Norwegian fish and EU lorry traffic through Austria's Alpine passes are far
more intractable issues, and could sink the talks. Austria wants to keep
restrictions on EU truck transit through the Alps for 10 more years, rather
than three as the Union insists.
The 12 were last night trying to agree a common line on fish, which
accommodates Spain's demand to catch 14,000 more fish in Norwegian waters,
and French-led demands for restrictions on incoming fish products from
Norway.
Sweden, which has fewer differences with the EU over the central issues of
agriculture, regional supports and fisheries, also made clear it would
consider signing an accord before its Nordic neighbours if it had agreed
terms but Norway and Finland had not by the March 1 deadline set by Brussels
for the completion of the accession talks.
Following a meeting in Helsinki of the leaders of the three countries, Prime
Minister Esko Aho of Finland and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, his Norwegian
counterpart, criticised the EU's proposals to limit regional support to
remote Arctic areas and for not meeting their demands for special treatment
of Nordic agriculture.
But Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, stressed that the talks were
being conducted bilaterally and Sweden was anxious to conclude a deal with
Brussels. 'Each country will have to decide for itself,' he said.

heightening concerns that Greece's rising public sector deficit is going to
exceed this year's target of 12.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr
Papadopoulos will also need to tackle 7.5m disputes over tax liability, some

The US and Japan yesterday said they would deliver to Gatt by nightfall
their final tariff schedules under the Uruguay Round of global trade talks,
ten days after the official deadline of February 15, writes Frances Williams
from Geneva. The two other members of the Quad group of leading trading
nations - the European Union and Canada - submitted their tariff schedules
this week. Though US officials have blamed Washington's delay on technical
problems in compiling the 1,000 page long schedule, it follows a row with
Japan over US withdrawal of tariff offers on some industrial electronics
items. Tokyo disputes US claims that these offers were conditional on
further Japanese tariff concessions on wood, white spirits and non-ferrous
metals, but now says it will not retaliate by adjusting its own offer. This
has raised hopes that the dispute may be quietly laid to rest. Other Gatt
members who have not already submitted tariff schedules are expected to do
so shortly. Ministers meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round
accords.

FT  26 FEB 94 / US expels top Russian spymaster
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday expelled Russia's senior intelligence officer from
Washington, in retaliation after the arrest in the US of a senior Central
Intelligence Agency officer on charges of spying for the Russian
intelligence service.
The State Department said Mr Alexander Lysenko, listed as a counsellor at
the Russian embassy but described by US officials as the rezident of
Russia's SVRR intelligence agency, had been declared persona non grata and
given seven days to leave the US.
Washington had asked Moscow to withdraw Mr Lysenko voluntarily after the
arrest on Monday of Mr Aldrich Ames, a senior CIA counter-intelligence
officer, but the Russian government refused.
Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, said Mr Lysenko 'was in a
position to be responsible for the activities associated with the Ames
espionage case.' He refused to rule out further expulsions.
The scale of the retaliation is considerably smaller than was habitual
during the Cold War years. In the last such incident, in 1986, 55 Soviet
diplomats were expelled.
Mr McCurry insisted that the US still strongly supported political and
economic reform in Russia: 'We believe that is just as important today as it
has been for months.'
The expulsion came after President Bill Clinton had spent the morning urging
senior members of Congress not to cut off all aid to Russia in response to
the arrest of Mr Ames and his wife, who are due to appear in federal court
in Virginia on Tuesday.
Mr Clinton called Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House, to
persuade them that aid to Russia, for purposes such as reducing nuclear
weapons and promoting economic reform, remained in the US national interest.
US support for reform in Russia 'does not flow from a sense of charity or
blind faith. Our policy is based on our clear American interests, clearly
pursued,' Mr Clinton said after the meeting.
He won support for the argument that the US should not overreact to the spy
incident but it was clear that the request for more Russian aid in the US
budget next year is in trouble.
Senior members of Congress are increasingly questioning not only the overall
amount of aid to the states of the former Soviet Union but also the
proportion that goes to Russia.
'While we all agreed that the spy incident would not, in and of itself,
warrant reconsideration of aid, there are a lot of other things that do. The
Russia-first policy, I think, is increasingly in disfavour in the Congress,'
warned Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, senior Republican on the Senate
committee that controls foreign aid spending.
He had insisted in budget negotiations last year on setting aside a portion
of the aid package for Ukraine. That portion is expected to increase this
year because of Ukraine's agreement with the US and Russia to give up the
nuclear weapons on its territory.
Other republics are claiming a larger share, some because they, too, have
agreed to abandon their missiles, and others because they have reformed
their economies further.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Moscow slips down today's G7 agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries
are to meet near Frankfurt today, to discuss the crisis in the Russian
economy. This is so intractable, however, that their discussions are likely
to focus as much on their own problems, of unemployment and lacklustre
growth.
The meeting was called last month by Mr Theo Waigel, German finance
minsister, to find out, as one sherpa put it, 'what the hell Russia is up
to'.
Since then, turmoil has hit the world's securities markets, a trade war is
threatened between the US and Japan, and there is rising concern about the
German economy, prompting the ministers heading for the meeting today to add
the global economy to their agenda.
The G7 finance ministers - and central bankers from the US, Japan, Germany,
France, Italy, the UK and Canada - will confer among themselves before
meeting Mr Sergei Dubinin, Russian finance minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin,
economy minister and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank governor.
They are expected to take a tough line with the Russians, in stressing the
need for concrete measures to control the government's budget deficit and
money supply.
Although the G7 delegates are keen to support the continuation of economic
reform, they are adamant that a reliable and predictable economic policy is
essential, above all to attract foreign investment and not simply to get
more public finance from the G7 governments.
Mr Waigel, who will be chairing the meeting, made clear in advance that
there are no plans for additional finance from the G7 group, but that
transfer of funds, already promised at the Tokyo summit last year, depends
on Moscow's further progress with the reform programme.
Given the confusion emanating from the former Soviet Union, and the
difficulty for the finance ministers of producing anything meaningful, the
US-Japan trade row threatens to hijack events. No communique is planned.
The US, which sees itself as the saviour of global economics, is aggrieved
that Japan and Europe have dragged their feet while Washington, in the words
of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, has 'laid the basis for a
revcovery with solid growth, a declining budget deficit and the lowest
inflation and interest rates in more than 20 years'.
The main US grievance is with Japan. It argues that Japan's inability to
create the growth required to reduce its external surplus is acting as a
drag on the world economy.
For its part, Japan will protest that it has taken the necessary steps to
boost growth in the form of its recent economic stimulation package.
Moreover, it argues that any form of numerical targetting of its bilateral
trade with the US runs against the spirit of a multilateral trade system and
the recent Uruguay round agreement to liberalise global trading, a point on
which it may well receive support from the UK and others.
Also, the US is expected to draw attention to the sluggish reduction of
interest rates in continental Europe since the currency crisis last year.
Although a senior US Treasury official conceded recently that the US would
not want to see the Europeans do anything 'imprudent', Mr Bentsen has called
attention to the 'staggering burden of rising unemployment' in Europe.
This issue is more likely to surface when the G7 meets again, next month in
Detroit, to discuss persistently high unemployment in industrialised
countries.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Murdered at morning prayers: David Horovitz in Hebron talks
to Arab and Jew in the wake of Israel's worst atrocity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the narrow slope leading down into Hebron from the Cave of the
Patriarchs, four silver-coloured portable barriers, covered in blood, were
drying in the winter sunshine. The trail of blood led further up the hill,
to the huge Herodian-built entrance to the Cave.
There, by the green entry doors, a sign in Hebrew, English and Arabic
requested of worshippers: 'Please preserve the sanctity of the site.' A
little after 5am yesterday that sanctity was shattered as never before.
Clad in his army reservist's uniform, and carrying a Galil automatic rifle,
Baruch Goldstein, a doctor who lived at the nearby Jewish settlement of
Kiryat Arba, slipped past the sleepy soldiers on duty outside, and made his
way into the tomb, filled with Palestinians just starting their early
morning Ramadan prayers. In a shooting spree that witnesses said lasted at
least 10 minutes, he murdered over 40 Palestinians, possibly as many as 50,
and wounded scores more. In a call of condolence and apology to the PLO
chairman Mr Yassir Arafat last night, Israel's premier, Mr Yitzhak Rabin
said Goldstein had tried to murder the fragile Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
Most of Hebron was deserted in the hours after the shooting, its stores
shuttered, just a few elderly men, heads bowed, walking slowly through the
market. But the streets were peppered with rocks and smouldering tyres -
lingering signs of the violent clashes between Palestinians and soldiers
that raged soon after the shooting, before the army clamped on a curfew. At
least six Palestinians were shot dead in clashes outside a hospital.
Outside the tomb itself, small clusters of dazed Palestinians milled around,
anxious to recount the details of the massacre. When, periodically, soldiers
came to shoo them away, smirking groups of young Jewish settlers took their
place, their guns slung casually over their shoulders. 'It's good, what
happened,' jeered one young settler at the Palestinians. 'We're at war with
the Arabs. It's just a shame that a Jew had to die.' Zuleha Muhtaseb, a
Palestinian woman in her thirties who was inside the tomb when the shooting
started, said the worshippers were just kneeling down to pray when she heard
what sounded like a bomb, followed by the rapid fire of an automatic weapon.
'I couldn't see the man,' she said. 'We all lay down on the floor. Whenever
anybody stood up, there was more shooting.'
Across town, at the Al-Ahali hospital to which many of the wounded were
taken, Sharif Zahidah lay propped up in bed, the bloodstains on his pillow
and sheets testimony to the bullet wound in his left side, perilously close
to his heart. In the chaos when the shooting started, he said, 'I thought at
first it was coming from outside. But then I saw that my whole row of
worshippers had collapsed. The man next to me was hit, and part of his brain
fell on my face.' At one point, said Zahidah, the gunman's weapon jammed.
Eventually he was overpowered. 'I think he was killed.'
Natshe Shabaan had been kneeling beside his brother Jamil, 48, the muezzin
who had called the Moslem faithful to that morning's prayers. Now Jamil's
name is just another on the photocopied list of the dead, stuck in the
window at the hospital's reception desk.
Walking through Hebron to the tomb, Lt-Col Yehuda Weinraub of the Israeli
army spokesmen, was hit on the head by a rock thrown from a rooftop. His
white bandage slowly turning red, he insisted to reporters that at no point
had soldiers opened fire. In fact, he said, countering witnesses' assertions
that a soldier had killed a man who tried to disarm Goldstein, there were no
soldiers inside the tomb; they were keeping a low profile in deference to
the Ramadan prayers. Lt-Col Weinraub was at a loss to explain why the
soldiers outside had allowed Dr Goldstein into the Cave, and promised a
thorough inquiry.
Just a few hundred yards away through deserted streets, at the Beit Hadassah
complex where several hundred of the most radical Jewish settlers maintain
their symbolic presence in the heart of Hebron, Danny Hismi, a friend of Dr
Goldstein, had his explanations ready. The doctor, he said, 'was the kindest
man - he wouldn't hurt a cat.' He had simply treated too many Jewish victims
of the Palestinian Intifada. 'He was always the first on the scene. A few
weeks ago, two of his neighbours, from the Lapid family, were murdered. He
had tried to save them. I think it was too much for one man. His opinions
were very radical, but then there are people with radical opinions
everywhere. You think, sometimes, that you want revenge, but you never do
it.'
A spokesman for the settlers in Kiryat Arba said more bluntly that Goldstein
had become mentally unbalanced since his friends died.
Determined to preserve Friday afternoon 'normality,' Mr Hismi was on his way
to deliver gifts of food to mark the Jewish Purim festival before preparing
for the sabbath. In the courtyard behind him, small Jewish children were
laughing though nothing out of the ordinary had been taking place down the
street.
In a basement at Beit Hadassah, a museum commemorates the 69 Jewish
residents of Hebron killed by Arab mobs in 1929. It was their deaths, and
the consequent severance of the Jewish presence in Hebron, that galvanised
Jewish settlers to return to this 60,000 strong Arab town in the spring of
1968, months after the West Bank had been captured by Israel in the 1967
Six-Day War.
Since then, more than 120,000 Jews have followed their example and made
homes in the occupied territories, but only the most ideologically-motivated
settlers can survive here and in the Kiryat Arba settlement that overlooks
the town, reviled as intruders by their Palestinian neighbours.
Barred from the Tomb of the Patriarchs for 700 years, the Jews have
gradually established equal praying rights with the Moslems, the two
communities tensely sharing the same place, at different times. The main
hall serves as a mosque, two side rooms as synagogues. Except on Fridays,
when Moslem prayer mats are laid out in all the rooms, and Jews are denied
entry. Or should be.

                           A VIOLENT PAST

Some of the worst incidents of violence since Israel captured the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967:
OCT 8 1990:
Israeli police shoot dead 18 Arabs on Jerusalem's Temple Mount after a
Palestinian protest flares into violence.
JULY 6 1989:
A Palestinian from the Gaza Strip seizes the steering wheel of an
Israeli bus and sends it plunging into a ravine, killing 16 Jews.
MARCH 11 1978:
Arab guerrillas infiltrate into Israel from the sea, killing 37 and
wounding 82 in an attack on a bus and other traffic.
APRIL 1974:
16 civilians and two soldiers killed by Arab gunmen entering Israel from
Lebanon.
MAY 30 1972:
Three Japanese gunmen acting for the hardline Marxist Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) shoot up Tel Aviv's Lod Airport
killing 25 and wounding more than 60. - Reuter

Japan plans to set a target for cutting its record current account surplus,
in what seems an inadequate attempt to defuse its trade row with the US.
The cabinet yesterday agreed to produce a market-opening plan by the end of
March, including a goal proposed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, to
reduce the surplus to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product, or Dollars
125bn (Pounds 84bn), this year, from the estimated 3.1 per cent of GDP for
the year to the end of March. The current account surplus was Dollars
131.35bn in the last calendar year.
This goal - not a binding pledge - is already in the government's economic
target for the coming year, published two weeks ago.
It received an instant dismissal from Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to
Japan: 'That's their current estimate. That wouldn't be anything. What we
need is to bring about a highly substantial reduction of the current account
surplus over the next four years.'
The plan to set a firm goal for a reduction in the surplus also ran into
criticism from Mrs Manae Kubota, director-general of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency, which draws up the government's economic targets.
It has managed to stick to few of its own current account targets since the
agency started compiling them in 1955, she pointed out.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The Clinton administration had no
immediate response to Japan's latest efforts to formulate a trade peace
plan.
However, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, issued a statement of
support for a tough new trade bill, introduced on Thursday by Congressman
Dick Gephardt, Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives,
and Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia.
The bill would require the US Commerce Department unilaterally to set
targets for foreign import penetration in Japan.

World leaders expressed shock and condemnation of the Hebron slaughter
yesterday and urged that the atrocity should not be allowed to derail
efforts to negotiate a peace agreement.
President Bill Clinton warned that the massacre would complicate the
difficult work of peace. 'It's horrible and I condemn it. It's a terrible
human tragedy and it only complicates the difficult work of peace,' he said
at the White House.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, spoke of his horror at the
killing, and said it 'underscores the imperative of accelerating the
negotiations' towards implementation of the declaration of principles signed
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last year.
He called for calm to prevent the 'enemies of peace' from exploiting
yesterday's tragedy. Mr Christopher also telephoned Mr Yassir Arafat, the
PLO chairman, to urge 'calm, reason and restraint'.
Similar sentiments came from other capitals, with the French foreign
ministry condemning the 'hateful crime' and also urging 'restraint' from all
parties.
In neighbouring Jordan the atmosphere was tense. An elderly British tourist,
Mr Howard Long, of Purley in Surrey, was stabbed in Amman hours after the
massacre but not seriously wounded. Westerners have been advised not to
stray away from the main tourist areas.
The US warned Americans travelling in Israel to stay out of East Jerusalem,
the West Bank and Gaza. The State Department also cautioned Americans to
exercise caution when travelling throughout the Middle East and Europe.
Angry Palestinian officials, however, said the slaughter in Hebron would
'psychologically and practically' affect peace negotiations due to resume in
Cairo early next week. Mr Said Kemal, head of the PLO mission in Cairo, said
Mr Arafat had called an an emergency meeting of the executive committee of
the PLO central council in Tunis to discuss the future of the negotiations.
However, Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the detailed
talks on Israeli withdrawal, said yesterday 'we are not contemplating
interrupting the peace talks'. He added: 'We don't know about the schedule,
but the peace talks will go on.'
Describing the killings in Hebron a 'major catastrophe', he said that it
'clearly demonstrated that these settlers are, will be and always have been
the major problem to a solution on the ground'.
Mr Shaath said it was imperative the Israelis take concrete steps to assure
the protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories. 'They have spent
75 per cent of the time in these talks discussing their security without
considering that of our people,' he said.
Longstanding Palestinian opponents of the Oslo agreement were quick to claim
that the killings showed that the PLO-Israeli deal was unworkable. 'It shows
that peace with the Zionists is impossible,' said a statement from Hamas,
the militant Islamic Palestinian group which also vowed to avenge the
killings and 'punish' Israeli troops and settlers.
Other 'rejectionist' Palestinian groups, including the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, both based in Damascus, also vowed vengeance.

Mexico is preparing to break with its nationalist past and formally accept
foreign observers of its presidential election in August, a senior
government official said.
The decision comes as peace talks aimed to end the peasant uprising in the
southern state of Chiapas seem to be making rapid progress. After four days
of talks, the rebels reported about 50 per cent of their demands had been
met.
President Carlos Salinas was 'seriously considering foreign election
observers. There cannot be any doubt about the process and transparency of
elections. There could be resistance (to the observers) but we can do it,'
said the official, speaking on presidential authority. He left little doubt
that the decision to admit foreign observers had been taken in all but name.
For historical reasons, Mexico would not accept US observers, he said. The
exact role of the observers had yet to be worked out, but it is expected
they would issue a formal report on the elections.
The negotiations between the political parties over electoral reform, which
have focused on the make-up of electoral tribunals but include the issue of
foreign observers, seem to have picked up momentum.
The official added that peace talks in Chiapas, aimed at formally ending the
uprising there, were going much more rapidly than expected. His view echoes
statements by Mr Manuel Camacho, the government's peace envoy in Chiapas,
who said the round of talks might finish tomorrow, after which rebel leaders
would consult their supporters.
The rebels said the government has promised electricity, health and
education services to indigenous people's villages, compensation for the
relatives of victims killed in the 56-day-old rebellion, and a commission to
ensure compliance with an eventual peace accord.

The cabinet yesterday agreed to produce a market-opening plan by the end of

reduce the surplus to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product, or Dollars
125bn (Pounds 84bn), this year, from the estimated 3.1 per cent of GDP for

131.35bn in the last calendar year.
This goal - not a binding pledge - is already in the government's economic

It received an instant dismissal from Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to
Japan: 'That's their current estimate. That wouldn't be anything. What we
need is to bring about a highly substantial reduction of the current account
surplus over the next four years.'
The scheme is likely to be on the agenda of a private meeting, in Frankfurt
this morning, of Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japanese finance minister, and Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, US treasury secretary, before a session of the Group of Seven
finance ministers. Japan will also be seeking co-operation from its G7
partners to avoid another steep rise in the yen's value.
The plan to set a firm goal for a reduction in the surplus also ran into
criticism from Mrs Manae Kubota, director-general of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency, which draws up the government's economic targets.
It has managed to stick to few of its own current account targets since the
agency started compiling them in 1955, she pointed out.
Mr Hata agreed that the government could not make a firm pledge on the
surplus because of the volatility of exchange and interest rates. But, as
long as Japan ran a heavy trade surplus with the US (Dollars 59bn last
year), 'we cannot have understanding from the international community,' the
foreign minister said.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, had hoped to have a market-opening
package ready in time for the G7 meeting today, but officials argued they
needed more time if they were to prepare plans of real substance.
The main headings include more deregulation (such as streamlined import
procedures), more open governmental procurement, tougher anti-trust rules,
and measures to promote imports and foreign investment.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The Clinton administration had no
immediate response to Japan's latest efforts to formulate a trade peace
plan. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, issued a statement
of support for a tough new trade bill, introduced on Thursday by Congressman
Dick Gephardt, Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives,
and Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia.
The bill would require the US Commerce Department unilaterally to set
targets for foreign import penetration in Japan. Mr Kantor said Mr Gephardt
and the senator had 'spent years thinking about the US-Japan relationship
and working for a change in Japan. We welcome this expression of
Congressional support for a policy that finally achieves real market opening
in key sectors in Japan.'

Alusaf, South Africa's only primary aluminium producer, yesterday backed
industry moves worldwide to reduce aluminium stocks and improve depressed
market conditions for the metal.
The company announced production cuts equivalent to nearly 10 per cent of
its planned future capacity.
Alusaf has in hand a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) expansion project to add
466,000 tonnes a year to its current 140,000 capacity, turning the company
into one of the biggest producers with about 4 per cent of global output.
Mr Rob Barbour, managing director, said that, while construction of the new
smelter was going ahead, Alusaf would reduce export tonnage from its old
smelter by 20,000 tonnes in 1994 and again in 1995. Alusaf was shelving
plans to increase the old smelter's capacity by 40,000 tonnes a year until
market conditions had improved.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Banks set out Pounds 1.5bn rescue package for Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks have presented outline proposals for a FFr13bn (Pounds
1.5bn) restructuring package to rescue the troubled leisure group.
Walt Disney, its powerful US parent company, would bear half the cost of the
restructuring.
'Disney got us into this mess and it's only fair that it should play its
part in finding a way out,' said a senior banker involved in the rescue
talks. 'It seems reasonable that if we put up half the money, Disney should
stump up the rest.'
Negotiations between the banks and the Disney companies began in earnest
after the banks on Monday received the final version of an investigative
audit of Euro Disney's finances commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy group.
KPMG has calculated that Euro Disney, which made a net loss of FFr5.3bn on
turnover of FFr5.7bn in the financial year to September 30, will require a
capital injection of FFr13bn to reduce its FFr20.3bn net debt to a
manageable level. The group is in a dire financial state after struggling to
service its debt at a time when its operations have been affected by the
recession.
Under the banks' proposal, Euro Disney would receive part of the FFr13bn
through an injection of capital from a rights issue and, possibly, a
debt-for-equity swap. The remainder would be provided indirectly by reducing
its contractual payments to Walt Disney and the cost of servicing its loans.
The package would involve Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, injecting half the FFr13bn by participating in the rights issue and
significantly reducing its entitlement to management fees and royalties from
Euro Disney.
The banks would provide a similar amount by underwriting the rights issue,
and possibly by swapping part of their debt for equity, and by agreeing to
reduce the interest rates payable on some of their loans.
The main sticking point is expected to be Disney's stance on royalties. It
has already temporarily waived its entitlement to a management fee of 3 per
cent of turnover which would have been worth FFr145m last year. It still
receives royalties of 10 per cent of admissions and 5 per cent of food and
merchandise sales that totalled FFr262m last year.
The US group is understood to have accepted the principle of further
concessions in these areas but is trying to limit the scale of the cuts.
However, both camps are confident they will be able to find a solution by
March 31, the deadline set by Disney. 'The numbers seem to add up and both
sides really want to do this deal,' said one negotiator.

FT  26 FEB 94 / LWT falls to Pounds 760m bid from Granada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada won control of London Weekend Television for Pounds 760m yesterday
after the first successful hostile bid in the UK television industry. The
combined group will command about 30 per cent of UK television advertising
revenue.
Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada's chairman, said: 'This is good for the industry
and good for both sets of shareholders.'
But LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland criticised those shareholders who had
failed to back a management team which 'has performed outstandingly well for
them'.
He singled out Mercury Asset Management, which accepted the offer for its
14.2 per cent stake on Thursday, and suggested it had been swayed by its
large stake in Granada. 'If there's one single reason why we lost, it is
that MAM has around Pounds 400m of Granada and less than Pounds 100m of
LWT.'
The directors and senior managers of LWT have the consolation that the value
of their shares in the company has doubled to about Pounds 75m since Granada
first took a stake in LWT last year. The shares were issued to 50
individuals following the controversial golden-handcuff scheme put in place
five years ago. Sir Christopher's holding is now worth about Pounds 14m. Mr
Greg Dyke, chief executive, has a Pounds 9m stake.
Granada expects to make significant cost savings from combining its
north-west ITV franchise with LWT's weekend station in London. Mr Gerry
Robinson, chief executive, insisted they would 'remain separate franchises'.
He would not be drawn on likely job losses.
As for the LWT directors, Mr Robinson said that Sir Christopher had agreed
'right from the start' that there would be no place for him in the enlarged
group. Mr Dyke's future was still a matter for discussion.
News of Granada's victory came shortly after the close of the bid at 3pm
yesterday afternoon. Granada said it had valid acceptances in respect of
40.3 per cent of LWT's shares which, together with the shares it already
owned, gave it a total of 57.8 per cent.
Institutions that accepted the bid included PDFM and Fidelity. It is thought
that AMP sold its shares in the market.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Malaysia rejects UK appeal on trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government last night accepted there was little it could do in
the short term to end the Malaysian trade ban, following an emotional
statement from Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian deputy prime minister. Mr
Anwar announced the exclusion of all UK companies from Malay government
contracts.
However, it emerged last night that Lady Thatcher, the former British prime
minister, who has a close personal relationship with Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's premier, is prepared to intercede in the dispute.
'She is keeping a close watch on the situation and would contact Dr Mahathir
if asked,' said a close friend of Lady Thatcher.
Lady Thatcher's zealous lobbying in the mid-1980s succeeded in persuading Dr
Mahathir to end his Buy British Last policy, imposed in 1981, and secured a
Pounds 1bn defence deal between Britain and Malaysia in 1988.
It also emerged yesterday that Lord Prior, chairman of the electronics group
GEC, had requested that Mr John Major, the prime minister, telephone Dr
Mahathir.
The Malaysians announced the ban in anger at British press allegations that
bribes were paid to Malaysian politicians and the recent disclosures of a
link between a Pounds 1bn defence contract won in 1988 and Pounds 234m paid
in aid for the Pergau hydroelectric dam.
Mr Anwar yesterday said of the British press: 'We detest their patronising
attitude and innuendoes that the government of developing countries,
particularly a Moslem-led nation like Malaysia, are incompetent and their
leaders corrupt.'
British government attempts yesterday to defuse the row appear to have
failed. Mr Major sent a letter to the Malaysian prime minister which arrived
early yesterday. Malaysian officials said they were not excited by the
letter's contents nor hopeful of any break in the impasse between the two
countries.
'We have no intention of reviewing our policy,' said Mr Anwar, in his
statement.
Foreign office officials said last night a plan to send the head of the
diplomatic service, Sir David Gillmore, to Malaysia had been shelved,
because 'this would only be worth doing if we thought we could make the
Malaysians change their minds'.
The exclusion of UK companies from Malaysian government contracts could cost
British industry hundreds of millions of pounds.
Business leaders expressed concern yesterday. Lord Weinstock, managing
director of GEC, a prime supplier of equipment under the defence contract,
urged the Labour party to set aside political differences. He has written to
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, saying: 'It cannot be worth exploiting
inaccurate media comment for the sake of a temporary embarrassment to your
opponents . . . when the consequence is to help bring about losses in UK
employment and business.'
A Labour official replied: 'Lord Weinstock should not be asking the Labour
party or any MP not to participate in the proper role of parliament.'
GEC is also one of seven companies, including P&amp;O, BICC, Kleinwort Benson
and Rolls-Royce, which have written to The Times accusing British newspapers
of writing 'ill-informed and tendentious articles'. The letter, in today's
edition, lauds Malaysia as 'a fine example to the world in racial harmony
and political stability'.
Mr Anwar was particularly critical of an article in The Sunday Times last
weekend which alleged that a British company had paid bribes to Malaysian
politicians and that Dr Mahathir had asked for a Dollars 50,000 (Pounds
33,500) payment.
Mr Andrew Neil, editor of the newspaper, said he regarded the attack as a
'badge of pride'.
He added: 'The British press ought to be proud of what it has done' in
uncovering links between the winning of the 1988 defence contract and the
provision of Pounds 234m in aid for the Pergau dam.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday admitted the two projects
had been 'entangled' for a few months in 1988.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Crisis talks over Mideast massacre: Israel and PLO accept US
plea on peace efforts after mosque killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HEBRON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestinians agreed last night to try to save the Middle East
peace process at talks in Washington after a Jewish settler shot dead at
least 50 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque.
President Bill Clinton said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister,
and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, had agreed to his request that they
should send negotiators to the US as soon as possible 'and to stay here in
continuous session until their work is completed'.
In the single worst attack on Palestinians since Israel occupied the West
Bank in 1967, an Israeli settler opened fire with an automatic rifle in the
packed Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron at the start of the morning's Moslem
Ramadan prayers. Dozens of Palestinians were wounded and a further 12 killed
by Israeli troops during subsequent protests.
As news of the killings spread throughout the occupied territories, first
Hebron and then the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip erupted in clashes
between Palestinians and Israeli troops.
'Extremists on both sides are determined to drag Arabs and Israelis back
into the darkness of unending conflict,' Mr Clinton said yesterday.
'The answer now is to redouble our efforts to conclude the talks between
Israel and the PLO and begin implementation of the agreement they have made
as rapidly as possible,' he said. No date has been set for the talks.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, called for calm to prevent the
'enemies of peace' from exploiting yesterday's tragedy.
The gunman, an American-immigrant doctor, Dr Baruch Goldstein, who lived in
the nearby radical Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, appeared to have
planned the attack in an effort to torpedo the peace negotiations.
The Israeli authorities said Dr Goldstein later died, but it was not clear
whether he had been overpowered or had committed suicide.
Mr Arafat summoned Palestinian leaders to a crisis meeting in Tunis. 'What
has happened today in the mosque is a real tragedy and will make a very
negative backfire on the whole peace process,' he said.
Mr Rabin said in a telephone call to Mr Arafat that he condemned the
massacre and promised to investigate eyewitness claims that Dr Goldstein had
not acted alone. He also offered to speed up the transition to Palestinian
self-rule in the territories.
'As an Israeli, I am ashamed,' he told Mr Arafat, according to an Israel
Radio report. Earlier Mr Rabin had said he hoped the 'loathsome criminal act
of murder' would not be followed by Arab attempts at revenge.
Several Israeli ministers proposed banning the racist Kach movement of which
Dr Goldstein was a member, and disarming its supporters.
The shooting took place soon after 5am, when the vast mosque that covers the
tomb of biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, was crammed with
about 500 Moslems marking the month-long Ramadan fast.
Dr Goldstein, a 42-year-old Brooklyn-born father of four who had spoken out
publicly about his hatred of Arabs, burst into the mosque wearing his army
reservist's uniform, and then opened fire with a Galil automatic rifle.
Eyewitnesses said Israeli soldiers on duty at the site allowed him to keep
firing for more than 10 minutes. An Israeli army spokesman insisted that no
soldiers had been inside the mosque, and that fleeing Palestinians had
prevented troops from entering to intervene.
Dr Wissam Muhtaseb, who was treating the wounded at Hebron's Al-Ahali
hospital, said six Palestinians were killed outside the hospital when
soldiers tried to disperse crowds congregating outside. There were also
reports of two deaths in Gaza and one in Nablus.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: SA set to soften tariff blow - Bid to
balance pain and gain of Uruguay Round deal

A new South African government is likely to be in the enviable position of
possessing a comprehensive, negotiated and revamped trade policy within
weeks of taking office after the country's first non-racial elections in
April.
Credit has to go to the foreign trade policy task force of the National
Economic Forum, the tripartite representation of government, business and
labour, which drew up South Africa's successful offer to the Uruguay Round
in less than six months last year. Mr Michael McDonald, the chief business
representative on the task force, says the NEF should be able to present a
broad trade policy document to the government in June.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, singled out the achievement
of a unified offer for special praise during a visit to South Africa last
week, clearly impressed at the workings of the 'golden triangle' of
government, business and the trade unions.
His message for his hosts was largely that of 'no pain, no gain'. South
Africa, with a number of highly protected industries and one of the world's
most cumbersome tariff structures, would find it tough to meet the
requirements of the Uruguay Round, but the country was well placed to take
advantage of new opportunities because of flourishing sectors such as
agriculture which had barely started to tap their export potential.
Mr Sutherland's outlook is borne out by research by the state-owned
Industrial Development Corporation. Although it showed that the Round would
lead to growth domestic product growth, with exports outpacing increases in
imports, sectors like textiles and car-making, currently enjoying 100 per
cent protection, would suffer a 4-5 per cent decline in employment as
tariffs were reduced to 45-50 per cent.
The implications of the Uruguay Round for jobs have become the prime concern
of the NEF given that a new government will be expected to tackle
unemployment, estimated unofficially at 40 per cent. The clothing and
textiles industries remain large employers with a combined workforce of
about 190,000, despite thousands of job losses in recent years, on which
some communities are entirely dependent for their livelihood.
The NEF is sanguine about what needs to be done. Further job losses are
inevitable, but the NEF is devising short-to-medium term subsidies to
cushion the blow while an industry task force is finalising recommendations
on restructuring the sector.
Mr McDonald says it would be wrong to over-emphasise the suffering which
adherence to Gatt rules will cause the economy. Industry faces only a
gradual introduction of new tariffs over as long as 12 years after their
formal implementation from next January. Negotiations are under way which
may give South Africa access to the US's general system of preferences while
an EU team is in the country to discuss preferential tariffs.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (10): The lion curbs its restless tail -
Robin Allen studies the challenges facing the 35 year-old Kuwait Investment
Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the recommendations to be made this month on improving the Kuwait
Investment Authority's management structure and investment policy are
already being implemented.
The proposals, by the KIA's strategy and planning task force, largely follow
the guidelines introduced more than 30 years ago. The investment losses
incurred in recent years would never have occurred if senior managers had
stuck to the authority's basic principles worked out since 1959.
In spite of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, the collapse of an unofficial
stock market, incipient and actual financial scandals at home and overseas,
they enabled an initial sum of Pounds 150m (Dollars 225m) to appreciate to
some Dollars 95bn by August 1, 1990.
Then came the Iraqi invasion and Operation Desert Storm which threatened to
bring the whole edifice down. But it survived, so that the state now has
almost Dollars 50bn in first-class liquid reserves. Few other countries -
and no other Arab country - have as much.
At a time when the ruling Al-Sabah family face a lot of criticism, Kuwaitis
can reflect that the man who put in the nuts and bolts was their own head of
state, the Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah. In 1959, he was appointed
head of the investment office in Kuwait's department of finance. After
independence in 1960 Sheikh Jaber became finance minister, and stayed in the
post until 1975 when he became prime minister. He succeeded as head of state
in 1977.
In the 1950s, Kuwait was still part of the sterling area. The main objective
of the investment office within the finance department was simply to keep
the country's oil revenue in Kuwait's sterling account in London and to
transfer whatever was needed to Kuwait for essential expenditures. The
surplus was re-invested. In the early 1950s this meant little more than
putting money on deposit with the Bank of England, which continued for many
years to act as custodian as well as adviser.
By the late 1950s the investment office had become more sophisticated. It
was already planning how best to convert the surplus oil and budget revenues
into long-term assets to guarantee future security. Until 1963 Kuwait's
investments were made through British representatives on the London-based
Kuwait Investment Board, which after 1959 was increasingly supervised by Mr
Khalid Abu Su'ud, a Jerusalem-born Palestinian, under the authority of
Sheikh Jaber. Mr Abu Su'ud is still the Emir's investment adviser.
Kuwait left the sterling area after independence. Its currency was changed
from the Indian rupee to the Kuwaiti dinar, and in 1963 the investment board
was replaced by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) chaired by the Kuwaiti
ambassador in London, Mr Khalid Jaffar. The KIO's first general manager was
Mr Bader Bazi until Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah took over in 1967, bringing Mr
Fouad Jaffer as his deputy. They remained at the top of KIO until 1992.
By 1963 the investment department of the finance ministry was becoming more
experienced, but it kept its conservative bias. Assets were no longer
restricted to the UK. The enactment of the Kuwaiti companies' law and the
commercial code enabled part of the state's reserves to be used to develop
Kuwait's economy through shareholding companies such as Kuwait Investment
Company; Kuwait Foreign Trading, Contracting &amp; Investment Company; Kuwait
Transport Company; Kuwait Airways Corporation; Kuwait Savings Bank. There
was also the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, which became the
financial arm of Kuwait's foreign policy.
In 1963, Sheikh Jaber set up an international advisory committee, whose
members were drawn from captains of western industry and finance.
Until the 1970s BP, together with the US's Gulf Oil, remained pivotal in
Kuwait's upstream and downstream petroleum industry. Sheikh Jaber delegated
Mr Abu Su'ud, by now the director of the investment department at the
finance ministry, to run the state's investment portfolio.
For most of the 1960s the volume of investments was counted in hundreds of
millions of pounds sterling rather than in billions. But as the assets grew,
so investments diversified: fixed interest securities or floating rate notes
or other negotiable instruments; first-class listed equity; feasible
long-term projects including direct investments and real estate.
In the 1970s the geographical spread started to include Japan for
medium-term investments. Investments started also to be made in Hongkong,
Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia, often through the London market, still
regarded as the world's financial centre, but many also through the Hongkong
stock exchange.
Direct investments, including real estate holdings, were never allowed to
account for more than 5-6 per cent of the total portfolio. This contrasts
with the existing 30 per cent balance (23 per cent if Spain is excluded),
after the excesses of the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The combination of
writing off the Dollars 5bn Spanish fiasco and guidelines implemented under
the present management will bring the proportion of direct investments down
to 10 per cent of the total. But the intention is to bring them down still
further to the 5-6 per cent fixed by Sheikh Jaber in the 1960s.
How the Spanish connection careered out of control is a separate story now
the subject of court proceedings in London and Spain.
The bulk of the direct and property investments were initiated after the
first oil price rises in 1973-74; in Britain through St Martins Holding
Company - property, manufacturing, health-care and foodstuffs: in the US
through Foster Lane. Both have had mixed fortunes, though despite everything
Foster Lane is still reported to have assets of some Dollars 3bn.
The West German investments were the direct result of the presence on the
KIA's advisory committee of Dr Hermann Abs, former head of the Deutsche Bank
(who died this month). Daimler-Benz was the first of many; Hoechst and
Metallgesellschaft followed. In normal times the size of these individual
holdings would have exceeded the six per cent limit. But in the mid-1970s
the volume of funds accruing to the Kuwait Investment Office's account were
anything but normal. Kuwait's reserves were growing at an unprecedented
rate; the investments were long-term in companies whose shares were
considered blue-chips.
Prior to 1976 all of Kuwait's surplus was in the General Reserve Fund (GRF).
In that year the Reserve Fund for Future Generations (RFFG) was created, and
into it was put half of the total assets - and all of the quality assets -
of the GRF. In addition, the RFFG was henceforth to receive each year 10 per
cent of the state's oil revenue.
Today the RFFG includes all the liquid assets plus Kuwait's quota to the IMF
and the Arab Monetary Fund, the World Bank and its affiliate, the
International Finance Corporation. By contrast the GRF has the rump of
unproductive assets; loan assets on the books of the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development including loans to such countries as Sudan, Iraq and
other previous beneficiaries now bankrupt; the capital of Kuwait's own
Central Bank and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation which by definition cannot be
touched; plus government holdings in 63 local companies of which 42 are
listed on the Kuwait stock exchange. Theoretically, these last have a
capitalisation of KD800m-KD1bn, representing an average holding of between
20-25 per cent of all quoted companies.
If both confidence and opportunities returned, the government could over
time sell these assets to a rejuvenated private sector, but today they are
worthless.
In 1981, the investment department at the finance ministry was superseded by
the KIA as a separate sovereign entity. This was at the height of the second
oil boom when Mr Abdel-Latif Yousef al-Hamad was finance minister. He has
many supporters who claim that had he been left in charge the country would
have been spared the worst of its financial troubles.
Tough, extremely able and of unquestioned integrity, Mr al-Hamad would in
time have ensured that the authority of the KIA imposed itself on the KIO.
But his recipe for dealing with the fall-out from the Souk al-Manakh
disaster was politically too drastic for the government of the day. His
departure meant the finance ministry reverted to Sheikh Ali al-Khalifah
al-Sabah, who was already the oil minister; and the managing directorship of
the KIA went in 1984 to a relatively unknown Kuwait university economics
professor, Dr Fahd al-Rashid. Sheikh Ali remained finance and oil minister
until 1985 when he ceded the former role to Mr Jassem al-Khorafi, a
prominent businessman.
As a result of all these changes the KIO in London became stronger than its
parent, a classic example of the tail wagging the dog. But the implications
of all these developments were already blurred, not only by the general
paralysis in the financial community caused by the crash of the Souk
al-Manakh, but also because, by the end of 1983, income from overseas assets
was equal to the country's income from oil. So who was to complain at the
time if the KIO made all the running? As far as most people could see it was
delivering the goods; and Sheikh Jaber's original guidelines were still
largely in place.
Among these was the stipulation that, direct investments apart, the KIA/KIO
should not take more than one per cent in any one company. If for example
KIA invested Dollars 1bn in the US equity market, the investment was spread
among 400 companies.
The conservatism of Kuwait's investment policy unexpectedly came to light in
1985 when a disgruntled former employee of Chase Manhattan in New York
leaked Chase's Kuwait portfolio to the press. Its structure and balance
reflected the sound nature of a cross-section of Kuwait's overseas
portfolio. Most blue-chip stocks were represented; the structure was exactly
what would have been expected from cautious trustees of any large family
trust.
The year 1985 saw another landmark: the dissolution of the national assembly
amid clear signs that it intended to take a much tougher line on the issue
of public accountability. It had already forced the resignation of the-then
justice minister, Sheikh Salman al-Duaij al-Sabah.
But even without the benefit of a suspicious parliament, the authorities by
1989 were sufficiently concerned about the direction of KIO's operations for
a new executive and supervisory board to be set up.
Its work however was interrupted by the August 1990 Iraqi invasion and
occupation. In fact, no audit of the KIO was done between 1990-1992. The
pre-war executive and supervisory board was disbanded after liberation, and
a new one appointed. This consists of the KIA's managing director Mr Ali
Rashaid al-Bader; Mr Abdul Abu Hasan, an ex-chairman of Burgan Bank and
former deputy-governor of the Central Bank; Mr Bader Mokhaizum, chairman of
Kuwait Finance House, and Mr Abu Su'ud.
The soundness of the original guidelines laid down by Sheikh Jaber was
evident when the crunch came in August 1990. Within months Kuwait was
obliged to fund the war effort.
Some Dollars 30bn was liquidated at short notice with healthy capital gains
intact. In less than a year, a second tranche of almost the same amount had
to be found. Altogether 60 per cent of Kuwait's overseas assets were sold -
discreetly, without moving or affecting the market, and realising all their
capital gains.
It was masterful. The Dollars 5bn loss in Spain has been more than made up
by an appreciation in the last year of the overall portfolio of some 40 per
cent on the approximate Dollars 35bn which remained intact after the
sell-offs.
These gains will more than cover the projected 1993-94 budget deficit of
Dollars 5bn - plus if necessary off-budget defence commitments as well.
The strategy now is to have not more than 20 per cent of the total portfolio
in any one country or market or sector. Existing distribution reflects a
rough balance between the five main investment areas: North America; the UK;
Europe; Japan; and south-east Asia.
The proportion of direct investments, including property, to the portfolio
as a whole will be reduced to 10 per cent, with the longer-term aim to bring
them back down to 5-6 per cent of the total.
The strategy allows for KIA to take over a company, but the acquisition of
any company has to keep within these renewed guidelines. Existing exposure
in direct investments excluding Spain is 23 per cent of the total; including
Spain they amount to some 30 per cent. Offices are to be opened in all the
principal locations, with outside investment managers in charge of
day-to-day operations for individual portfolios.
So in spite of war, invasion, past mismanagement and scandals, Kuwait's
overseas assets, possibly the lifeblood of the next generation, have
survived to grow again. The foundations laid 35 years ago have stood the
test of time.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (11): All change at the KIO in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kuwait Investment Authority is now faced with two priorities as Kuwait
emerges from the trauma of invasion and the KIA from past mismanagement,
writes Robin Allen.
They are to improve internal structure, particularly the chain of command
and control, and to improve management.
Central to this task is ensuring the London-based Kuwait Investment Office
is firmly subordinated to the KIA's central authority and never again
allowed to arrogate to itself the power to embark on uncontrolled financial
adventures.
The KIO's general manager since February last year, Mr Yousef al-Awadi,
needed only one month to supervise the merger of KIO into KIA. This was
completed last March.
The second priority is to establish a mature relationship with a revived and
forceful national assembly (parliament).
This will entail KIA's (and the government's) acceptance of a degree of
sustained public accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. If good
intentions prevail, the new-look KIA will reassure Kuwaitis that their
national wealth is in safe hands.
Overall strategy is being fine-tuned by the 'Strategy and Planning Task
Force', an internal committee due to complete its work later this month.
Relations with the National Assembly should improve over time.
The authority of the national assembly to scrutinise the KIA - and the
government's policies that dictate the KIA's investment decisions - was
further strengthened by its unanimous rejection last month of the
controversial ministers' trial law. This imposed restrictions on ministers
being brought to trial.
The immediate issue was whether Sheikh Ali al-Khalifah al-Sabah, the former
oil and finance minster, should stand trial following allegations of
embezzlement from the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company. The trial opened on
February 5, and Sheikh Ali was among those charged.
The principle was as important as the immediate issue. Mr Ismail al-Shatti,
an Islamic conservative who is head of the national assembly's finance
committee, described it as a 'revolutionary law in Kuwait's financial life'.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (8): A phoenix from the ashes of war -
Robert Corzine describes the resurrection of the Burgan oilfield, the second
largest in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The giant Burgan oil field in Kuwait is the stuff of which oilmen's dreams
are made. Discovered in 1938, in production since 1946 and set alight by the
Iraqis in 1991, it still accounts for two-thirds of Kuwait's proved oil
reserves of 96.5bn barrels, which are a tenth of the world's total.
Burgan's size is matched by the ease with which it has given up its riches.
The 4,000 foot depth of the reservoir means that new wells take just three
weeks on average to drill.
Production wells flow freely without expensive gas or water injection
because of favourable pressure conditions within the reservoir.
But it was the positive pressure from Burgan's 636 wells that helped to
create the nightmarish inferno unleashed by the retreating Iraqis three
years ago.
Evidence of those days can still be seen. In places there are heaps of
charred, twisted metal that at one time formed the shining 'Christmas tree'
blow-out preventors that topped the wells, while occasional burned out
trucks litter the roadside.
The earthworks and berms built by the multi-national fire-fighting teams who
extinguished the blazes within seven months can still be seen, as can some
of the 200 oil lakes created by more than 20m barrels of oil which gushed
forth from wells that failed to catch fire.
Officials from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Company, operators of the field,
say 18m barrels of oil have been pumped from the lakes for conversion to
bitumen, some of which is being used to coat the defensive sand wall being
built along the border with Iraq. The contents of many of the smaller lakes
are being concentrated in a few large ones, from which the remaining 3m-4m
barrels of oil will be drained.
The reaction of the oil in the lakes with sunlight and rain has caused some
concern among Kuwaitis about possible atmospheric pollution. There are
similar worries that the oil-soaked soil beneath the lakes could have a
long-term effect on aquifers, the desert food chain and air quality in
Kuwait.
Various methods are under consideration to treat the most
heavily-contaminated soils, which total about 20m cubic metres countrywide.
Unlike other Kuwaiti oil fields, Burgan has no aquifers near the surface, so
contamination of water supplies in the area is unlikely, according to
Kuwaiti scientists.
Ironically one of the most vivid examples of war damage remaining in the
field can be found not at a site dynamited and mined by the Iraqis, but at
an oil and gas processing centre destroyed by American aircraft because it
was being used as a military command post. Dozens of Iraqis died at the
site, the devastation of which was so complete that KOC officials decided to
reconstruct the facility elsewhere.
For the time being the ruins serve as a reminder to visitors of the
vulnerability of oil facilities in a politically uncertain region. Two
rusting pick-up trucks holed by cannon fire stand guard by the gate. Inside
the impact craters left by missile strikes are gouged into the concrete
paving. Collapsed storage tanks lean at crazy angles from the intense heat
of the resulting fires, which fused together parts of compressors and other
high technology equipment.
But such sights are the exception in a field which is almost back to
business as usual. Mr Mustafa al-Adsani, manager of production and export
operations for KOC, says rehabilitation of the damaged wells is almost
complete. Six hundred have been re-worked and 140 new ones have been
drilled. Only a few more damaged wells remain to be repaired.
The rehabilitation of processing and storage facilities to pre-war levels is
also nearing completion. Surface facilities in Burgan and the other Kuwaiti
oil fields are now capable of handling 2.8m b/d, according to Mr Adsani. Oil
storage capacity, which dropped to 3m-4m barrels in the aftermath of the
war, is back at the pre-war level of 15m barrels.
The damage done to Burgan below the ground is less easy to ascertain,
however. Industry experts say the maximum blow-out rate of the field was 6m
barrels a day, more than three times the average daily production currently
being achieved in the UK sector of the North Sea.
More than 1bn barrels of oil were lost, the equivalent of what the oil
industry would class as a highly prized 'elephant' field elsewhere in the
world.
The long-term impact on the reservoir of the uncontrolled release of such
large volumes of oil is under study, with the first results due later this
year. Some press reports have speculated about the extent to which water
movement resulting from the Iraqi actions within the reservoir may affect
eventual recovery rates.
But the reservoir 'appears to be in remarkably good shape,' according to
Western experts familiar with the field.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (9): What the saboteurs missed - Mina
Abdullah refinery, torched by the Iraqis, recovered quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwaiti oil officials are likely to draw particular satisfaction from the
imminent commissioning of the new central control room at the Mina Abdullah
refinery, one of three such facilities grouped along the southern Kuwaiti
coast.
Three years ago the departing Iraqis, frustrated at having failed to master
the intricate electronic systems at the heart of the refinery, triggered a
massive explosion in the multi-million dollar control centre. It destroyed
the facility, but they overlooked several smaller satellite centres which
controlled specific areas of the complex.
It was an error that allowed the refinery gradually to recover much of its
capacity without the use of a central control complex, although at the cost
of some efficiency. Earlier this month Kuwaiti workers and foreign
contractors were busy making the final preparations to transfer full control
of the refinery to the new centre. Its completion marks an important
milestone in the rehabilitation of Kuwait's refining industry, the pre-war
showpiece of the downstream sector.
Before the war the three refineries - Mina Abdullah, Mina al-Ahmadi and
Shuaiba - formed one of the most advanced refining centres in the world.
They were the centrepiece of Kuwait's strategy to extract as much value as
possible from its oil reserves by exporting refined products as well as
crude oil.
The damage inflicted by the Iraqis was intended to 'cripple or delay as long
as possible their use,' according to Mr Sami Fahed al-Rushaid, head of
corporate planning at Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, the state-owned
company which oversees domestic refining and marketing.
But although the Iraqis intended to destroy as much as possible, their
actions were erratic. Shuaiba, for example, was damaged so badly that some
of its units may not be rehabilitated. Mina al-Ahmadi was also extensively
damaged, but it was the first to be brought back on line. None of Mina
Abdullah processing units were hit, although there was extensive damage to
the shipping facilities and the fire water system in addition to the control
room. The refineries also suffered damage from Allied bombing aimed at the
pipes through which the Iraqis released crude oil into the Gulf.
KNOC estimates suggest that KD120m has been spent in capital costs to repair
the total damage, although final figures have yet to be calculated. There
was also significant indirect damage as a result of the plants being idle
during the Iraqi occupation. The cost of overhauling corroded processing
units and other facilities, for example, is estimated at KD20-30m, according
to the KNOC.
Officials say the rehabilitation has proceeded relatively smoothly. There
have been some delays, Mr Rushaid says, but the longest has been just five
months. The loss of many Palestinian workers and other expatriates is,
however, being felt.
Absenteeism rates in some refineries are high, and there has been a marked
reduction in the enthusiasm that workers displayed in the immediate post-war
period.
The current restoration drive will only bring Kuwait's throughput capacity
up to 645,000 barrels a day, well short of its pre-war level of 776,000 b/d.
But KNOC's long-term goal is to expand the capacity of the three domestic
refineries to 800,000-900,000 b/d, irrespective of possible new investments
in overseas refineries.
It is also assessing how to react to the growing demand for cleaner, less
polluting fuels such as unleaded petrol and low sulphur diesel. 'That will
probably mean revamps and changes to existing units rather than any
short-term increase in capacity,' says Mr Rushaid.
Speculation that the refineries might be included in any privatisation
programme are premature, say officials. The three facilities were built as
separate units, but they have been steadily integrated, making the sale of a
single unit difficult.
Foreign participation in new downstream projects is more welcome, however.
Last year the Petrochemical Industries Company, another state organisation,
signed a memorandum of understanding with Union Carbide of the US to build a
large ethylene plant alongside the refineries.
Mr Hani Hussain, chairman of PIC, sees the project as a model for future
foreign involvement in the domestic downstream sector. Union Carbide and PIC
will each have a 45 per cent share, with 10 per cent reserved for local
private investors.
Mr Hussain stresses that the decision to opt for foreign participation was
based on strictly commercial grounds, with Union Carbide providing
state-of-the-art technology and marketing expertise, while Kuwait supplies
low cost feedstocks and infrastructure.
'Politics was not the driving force,' he says, although the arrangement 'may
meet political objectives' of having a bigger foreign business presence to
enhance the country's long-term security.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (6): Goodbye to narrow nationalism - Robert
Corzine on how the state oil company is striving for efficiency and
cooperation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwait was at the forefront of the drive in the 1970s by oil producers to
wrest control of their industries from foreign concession holders.
In the 1990s Kuwait may prove to be a pioneer in the process of reshaping
often bloated state oil companies along the leaner lines of their private
sector counterparts. And it may do so in partnership with foreign companies.
The beginnings of what could evolve into a radical departure in oil policy
come after two decades in which Kuwait built up a fully integrated,
state-owned industry. Subsidiaries of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the
holding company at the centre of the sector, are involved at all stages of
the industry's 'value chain', from crude oil production to refining,
petrochemicals, retail marketing and shipping, both in Kuwait and abroad.
The structure, modelled on that of the big integrated oil majors, has helped
to even out revenue flows. Refining and marketing, for example, are
traditionally able to achieve higher margins during periods of low oil
prices.
Kuwait's low cost of production, estimated by Western experts to be as
little as 70-80 US cents a barrel, is an added advantage. In the past it has
offset to some extent the inefficiency associated with chronic over-manning
of the sector.
But just as the Kuwait government is having to think about ways to reduce
the welfare state, the highly cosseted oil industry is having to think about
how it will adjust to growing world competition in an era of relatively low
prices.
Low production costs cannot be the only measure of the industry's
efficiency, according to Mr Nader Sultan, the new deputy chairman of KPC and
until last November the former head of its international operations in
London.
He believes the main challenge facing the sector is the need to adopt the
best practices of international oil companies, but to do so within the
restrictions imposed by the company's social obligations as the country's
single-largest employer and most politically-sensitive industry.
Mr Sultan acknowledges that 'sometimes it feels as though I am being pulled
apart' by conflicting forces, although he is optimistic that a
politically-acceptable way forward can be found.
The privatisation of some KPC assets is central to the drive for efficiency,
he says. The first step is still being debated, but it is likely to be the
sale of domestic service stations. Other activities such as the domestic
distribution of LPG cylinders and shore-based support services for visiting
tankers could follow.
Outside investors might also find an early role in Kuwait's fleet of oil and
refined product tankers.
The sale of refining operations is less likely. 'We would have a problem if
a potential partner said let's have a joint venture at an existing refinery,
he says. 'What real advantage could they bring? But starting with a clean
slate is different.'
Likewise, he sees no prospect of selling off well-developed production
assets such as part of the giant Burgan oil field. But future foreign
involvement in the exploration and production of undeveloped reserves is one
of the main issues in a wide-ranging internal debate over Kuwait's future
oil policy.
At present foreign involvement is confined to technical assistance contracts
such as the one held by British Petroleum. Amoco and Chevron are discussing
similar arrangements, which some Kuwaitis believe could evolve into broader
cooperation, including joint ventures.
Mr Sultan, however, believes much can be done to improve efficiency in the
industry before 'we bring in foreign partners'. But partnerships may be
essential to maintaining the momentum of an efficiency drive, he adds. There
would also be substantial technical and administrative advantages to
partnerships, according to western industry executives.
Foreign involvement would also lessen the costs of raising sustainable
capacity to 3m barrels a day, 1m b/d more than Kuwait's present quota from
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Mr Sultan says the higher
figure is equivalent to the long-term market demand for Kuwaiti oil.
Industry observers say it would also boost Kuwait's bargaining power in
Opec, as well as allow it to respond to any sudden shortfalls in world
markets.
Specific areas which might be opened to exploration include potential
offshore fields as well as parts of western Kuwait, near the Iraqi border.
The presence of western oil companies in such militarily sensitive areas is
seen by many Kuwaitis as a way to enhance their long-term security. It might
also counteract nationalist arguments against foreign participation in oil
production. In addition any agreements with foreign companies are likely to
be production sharing deals rather than the concessions which Kuwaitis
associate with the colonial era.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (7): Offset rules sustain the local market
 -Mark Nicholson explains how Kuwait uses arms purchases to win inward
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwait has high hopes of its offset programme. The requirement that defence
contractors re-invest a nominal 30 per cent of the value of their deals in
new Kuwaiti joint ventures is, for example, expected in the short term to
provide the biggest source of foreign investment in an economy which has
seen little of it since the Gulf war.
The government also sees its offset programme as among the best of few
available tools for regenerating Kuwait's private sector, which has also
invested little of its own money in the state since the war. The programme
appears to offer the best hope of introducing new technology and training
opportunities into the country. The government also expects it to provide
new products for export.
Finally, but probably as important as any economic benefits, the government
hopes the offset programme will provide the country with a strategic
bulwark. 'If we have foreign interests inside the country,' explains one
offset official, 'this will obviously help the government get strategic help
if it ever needs to ask for it again.' The offset programme is thus expected
to double Kuwait's strategic gain from its defence dollars, buying both
weaponry and a sort of 'human shield' of foreign investments and investors.
The catch in what otherwise appears an elegant one-off solution to many of
Kuwait's most pressing post-war needs, however, is that the Gulf state's
multi-billion-dollar rearmament programme is obliging defence contractors to
come up with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of re-investment
projects, and it is unclear where such big opportunities lie. Kuwait's
non-oil sector was not highly developed before the Gulf war and has shrunk
considerably since. The juiciest parts of the oil sector itself lie, for the
present at least, quarantined from foreign investment.
In addition, since the offset programme requires foreign investors to find
joint venture partners to hold 51 per cent of any project, the plan assumes
that incoming companies will awaken local investors to projects they have
somehow missed. But as one offset-seeking executive puts it: 'Kuwaitis have
been investing themselves in what opportunities there are in this country
for the last 40 years. This is a very well ploughed field indeed.'
The architects of Kuwait's offset programme were well aware of these limits
to Kuwait's ability to attract and absorb investment and have accordingly
designed what many defence contractors consider among the most flexible of
such schemes in the world. A unique feature of Kuwait's programme, for
instance, is that it will permit offshore joint ventures with Kuwaiti
partners to count against the offset requirement: re-investment in other
Gulf countries, the Arab world or anywhere else are acceptable, in that
order of preference. Neither do defence contractors have to make the
re-investment directly. To satisfy the programme's requirements, they need
only introduce the investment to Kuwait - though they would retain overall
responsibility for its performance.
For domestic investment, which is the government's priority, the scheme also
includes a series of multipliers designed to encourage investment in
preferred sectors. Investment in education, management, training or
manufacturing, for example, earns a multiplier of four, so that a Dollars 1m
investment in these areas counts as Dollars 4m against the offset
obligation.
Assembly, processing or partial manufacturing projects earn multipliers of
three. Investment in services earns a multiplier of two. 'The plan is
designed to reflect government priorities rather than to force investment
towards them,' says an offset official. But even given these incentives, the
scale of investment obliged under the scheme is forcing defence contractors
to search with considerable imagination for new projects. Proportionate to
the sum of defence contracts already awarded by the Kuwait government, a
notional Dollars 500m worth of reinvestment has either already been obliged
under the programme or is in immediate prospect. 'It's really become a big
race,' says one western arms supplier. 'No-one can see that value of
reinvestment out there, so it's a question of getting in there first.'
So far three companies have signed preliminary agreements under the offset
scheme. Hughes Aircraft, the US defence group, was the first, committing
itself in late 1992 to a Dollars 27.6m offset under a Dollars 92m deal to
sell Kuwait early warning radar. Hughes has already set up a joint venture
to establish a training centre directly related to its defence sale.
Aerospatiale Missiles of France late last year signed a Dollars 5m offset
deal as part of its supply of an undisclosed number of missiles to Kuwait,
but has not yet detailed its proposed project. Neither has Raytheon, the US
group which has agreed a more than Dollars 300m sale of Patriot missiles to
Kuwait, giving it a formal offset obligation of Dollars 98m. However,
Raytheon executives have already tantalisingly suggested they are preparing
a direct investment in a manufacturing project in Kuwait which they say will
far exceed this nominal requirement. No details of what Raytheon has in mind
have so far been released.
By March, GKN, the British automotive and defence group, is expected to sign
a memo of understanding on a Dollars 300m offset requirement as part of its
near Dollars 1bn deal to supply just over 250 Warrior armoured personnel
carriers. The company is in the earliest stages of examining what projects
might be offered.
But even without the further defence purchases for which Kuwait has, at
least for now, budgeted, offset commitments will almost certainly rise
further. Within a month or two, according to offset officials, the
government intends to extend its offset obligations to all supply contracts,
defence or civil, exceeding KD1m.
With Kuwait's absorptive capacity already beginning to look strained under
the weight of such sums, contractors are already looking with slightly
anxious hope towards the government's embryonic privatisation plans. 'It
would seem the perfect fit for us to satisfy our offset requirements by
plugging into privatisation sales,' says one western executive.
Just now, however, the timing is awkward. Most offset deals already signed
must lead within a month or two to specific 'concept papers' on projects to
be pursued. The earliest real privatisation offering is not expected before
the end of this year. Kuwait, meanwhile, will undergo perhaps the most
thorough scouring for investment opportunities in its history.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (4): The strange tale of Souk al-Manakh -
Robin Allen describes the disastrous legacy of six years of gambling on an
unlicensed stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's credibility is at stake over settling the debts incurred by
investors in an unregulated spree from 1976 to 1982.
The next real test in what is known as the Difficult Debts Settlement
Programme will come after March 31.
The 'difficult debts' were incurred by 'investors' on the unofficial - and
officially illegal - stock exchange which was housed on two floors at the
bottom of a multi-storey car park called the Souk al-Manakh. There, for six
years from 1976, the temptation to gamble through a system of post-dated
cheques in Kuwaiti and Gulf off-shore companies which could not get a
listing on the official market, proved too strong for thousands of Kuwaitis.
Other Gulf nationals, particularly in Bahrain and the UAE, were also
ensnared by the evergreen market: until it all burst, in August 1982, when a
few sceptics unsportingly cashed in their cheques and caused the whole paper
structure to crumble overnight. The gross debts amounted to KD27bn (Dollars
92bn). In the anguished tally that followed, many of the cheques cancelled
each other out, leaving a net indebtedness of some KD7bn (Dollars 23.5bn).
But the underlying credibility problem for the government reverts to 1976
after the government of the day had dissolved the national assembly. In the
aftermath of dissolution, and in an attempt to divert public indignation,
the government turned a blind eye to the early beginnings of the Souk
al-Manakh.
It then created an unfortunate precedent when, a year later, it paid out
KD155m (more than Dollars 500m) to people who had lost money in the
mini-depression of that year. This single act instilled in a generation of
Kuwaitis the notion that if they got into financial difficulties, the
government would help them. Over the years this notion developed into a
conviction that, in times of private sector difficulties, the government had
a duty to step in and bail them out.
Among the thousands of Kuwaitis who suffered were several members of the
ruling Al-Sabah family from the prime minister downwards. This factor too,
now has serious implications for the government's credibility.
A few debtors from the 1982 crash started to settle their debts in 1986. The
previous year the national assembly had been dissolved again, not least
because it had forced the resignation of the then justice minster, a member
of the Al-Sabah family, for his role in the Souk al-Manakh disaster.
After dissolution the government stepped in, through the Central Bank, to
initiate what is now known as Difficult Debts Settlement Programme 1
(DDSP1). Under this scheme, debtors were offered a 15-year pay-off period.
If, as some say, this is largely a red-herring now, it is still a fact that
big debtors today are using the terms of DDSP1 as a rationale for dragging
their feet.
In July 1992, three months before the October elections by which today's
national assembly came into being, the government issued Law 32, by which it
bought out KD5.9bn (Dollars 19.7bn) of personal and corporate debt from the
private sector in return for debt bonds issued to the commercial banks. The
law took effect from August 1992.
The banks took advantage of this to unload all their unwanted loan assets,
most of which was money lent to clients for the Souk al-Manakh. Some of the
indebtedness, for example a KD400m real estate portfolio on the books of
Kuwait Finance House which the KFH has to repurchase within 10 years, were
depreciated investments; and some were personal borrowings incurred during
the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. But according to the central bank governor
Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, some KD5.1bn (Dollars 17bn) reverted to the Souk
al-Manakh.
There are now, according to Sheikh Salem, a total of 9,549 debtors under the
present settlement programme. Of these 1,146 are liable for more than 90 per
cent, or Dollars 15.3bn, of the total Dollars 17bn. Many bought property or
liquid investments outside the country, on credit, at the height of the Souk
al-Manakh boom, and are now reluctant to disclose these assets. They are
even more unwilling to repatriate them to pay their debts.
The other 88 per cent of the debtors, who number just over 8,400, are the
so-called 'small debtors', most of whom owe KD500,000 (Dollars 1.7m) or
less.
Not all debtors are individuals. Some are companies and some of these are
owned by the state. The full list of individuals and the amounts each owes
has never been published.
The settlement programme now operating is based on Law 41 of 1993, passed by
the national assembly on August 31. It took effect one week later, on
September 6.
Debtors are given two options by which they can repay: cash payments or a
rescheduling over a 12-year period at equal annual installments. It is still
generally hoped that the vast proportion of small debtors will choose the
first option. This would greatly simplify collection of the other 90 per
cent of the total outstanding from the major debtors.
The deadline for debtors to decide on their preferred option and to complete
the necessary documentation is March 31, 1994. The country's six commercial
banks have been put in charge of managing the programme under the overall
supervision of the Industrial Bank of Kuwait. The banks will also be held
responsible if there are deficiencies in the mechanics of debt-collection.
By March 31 each debtor should have collected all the necessary
documentation from the bank of his choice; have had the documents
authenticated and notarised by the ministry of justice or a notary public;
and have returned these to the bank. The penalty for not complying is
exclusion from the settlement programme, and the debtor would then be told -
by the court in theory - to pay in full plus interest, as from August 1,
1990, the day before the Iraqi invasion.
According to Sheikh Salem, the banks in their capacity as collecting agents
are by law obliged to send the names of delinquent debtors to the justice
ministry. It is left to the courts, with the executive authority of the
cabinet, to implement the law, which, according to Sheikh Salem, will be
enforced regardless of the position or the identity of the individual. 'If
the banks do not implement their part, they will be punished,' he said.
There is, however, no clearly defined legal entity to oversee the
application of the law. The national assembly which passed the law, is not
an administrative body, and in any case, as one Kuwaiti remarked, 'is hardly
a disinterested group'. The Central bank is barred from administering the
law, so by default the banks have to do it.
The arithmetic of the settlement programme is easy enough - and generous in
the extreme to those who choose the cash option.
Under this first option, debtors get a partial write-off followed by
repayment of the balance over two years starting, according to Sheikh Salem,
from September 7, 1993 - one day after the law came into effect. The initial
write-off depends on the size of the debt. As the size of the debt increases
the scale of the write-off goes down.
The balance must be paid within two years from September 6, 1993, when the
law came into effect. Those who pay their debt in full by the end of the
second quarter of this year will receive an extra 4 per cent discount. This
bonus rate decreases by 0.5 per cent for each successive quarter. To get the
full 4 per cent a debtor needs to have been paid in full by December 6,
1993; the second quarter ends on March 6, 1994, and so on.
Under the second option - to repay on equal annual instalments over 12 years
 -an 8 per cent discount on the total amount is allowed for early repayment.
The annual installments are fixed by the Central Bank on the basis of the
outstanding amount with no interest charged.
Sheikh Salem said the total amount to have been repaid up to January 20 this
year by some 2,000 debtors was KD117m, which allowing for the applicable
discounts, accounted for KD337m, or 6.6 per cent, of the total debt
outstanding.
Accountants say there are still some uncertainties in the financial analysis
of the choices, but these only concern the exact timing of the instalments
under the 12-year option.
More serious is the sentiment among many businessmen. They have reservations
which reflect the general low esteem in which the government is held. Some
debtors, the larger ones or their representatives, are pressing for easier
terms. They say that large assets sales to refund their debts will trigger a
collapse in values, on the stock exchange for example. They insist that
although the government claims to be offering two options, in reality there
is only one. The second option, they claim, is punitive, because the
repayment period is too short. It should be 20 years, not 12.
They are supported by those who maintain the first settlement programme,
initiated in 1986 with a proposed 15-year pay-back period, is still valid;
and that was before the trauma of Iraqi occupation and the extra
indebtedness incurred as a result.
Many of those now objecting probably do not intend to pay or do not believe
the government can force them to pay - or simply reckon that the government
will buckle under pressure and ask the national assembly to change the law.
The official position is that the government will neither revise nor review
the bad debts law. In reality, the government is holding its breath.
If the biggest debtors set an example and climb on to the settlement
bandwagon, much of the government's credibility will be restored. If not,
then the fall-out will be damaging politically as well as financially.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (5): Over-protected species - Banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more archaic laws in Kuwait's commercial code is a three-year
suspension of trading in shares of any company, including banks, that wants
to merge while listed on Kuwait's stock exchange, writes Robin Allen.
To be fair, this law - and a separate one which specifically bars banks from
merging - is due to be repealed. According to Mr Ismail al-Shatti, the head
of the national assembly's finance committee, the bills have passed the
committee stage.
Merging, in Kuwait's over-banked stock market, is possibly the only way for
the weaker members of the banking community to regenerate themselves. That
was the thrust of the message delivered at a seminar last November by Mr
Yousef al-Awadi, general manager of the London-based Kuwait Investment
Office. 'The time has come for some of the banks' shareholders and
management to forego ...short-term self-interest and instead focus on the
long-term corporate survival of their organisations.' The only way to cut
costs was to get rid of redundant employees and branches, he said.
His argument has widespread support. The biggest problem confronting the
banks' domestic sector is now a simple lack of opportunities rather than the
Souk al-Manakh debt burden of previous years. This was eased with the
government's purchase in August 1992 of almost Dollars 20bn worth of private
sector indebtedness in return for debt bonds.
The case for having fewer banks is unassailable. The domestic market is flat
with lending opportunities confined to some trade financing, guarantees and
working capital. Central Bank figures for last October show that the total
assets of the nine commercial and specialised banks was down from the
previous year, at KD8.5bn (Dollars 28.5bn) compared with KD8.94bn at the end
of October 1992. The only growth prospect is consumer finance among Kuwait's
1.6m population. Here it is very competitive, with two banks, National Bank
of Kuwait and Gulf Bank, leading the pack.
The six commercial banks are of widely varying quality in what is often seen
as a three or four-tiered banking system. National Bank of Kuwait is in a
league of its own in terms of strength of capital and reserves, and a
quality management allowed to get on with the job by a hands-off board and
shareholders who have put in place a coherent strategy for the management to
target. It is the only Kuwaiti bank of real international calibre, retaining
the largest international presence and holding more than 40 per cent of all
Kuwait's bank deposits.
Its 1993 results further strengthened its lead. Net profits were up 23 per
cent to KD52m (Dollars 175m), almost three times the level of its nearest
rival, Gulf Bank. NBK's total assets were up 28.4 per cent at KD3.3bn, and
the bank maintained a capital to risks ratio of more than 20 per cent.
The second tier would consist of Gulf Bank - and some would say Burgan Bank
as well, though Cyprus-based analyst Capital Intelligence says that 'while
NBK is in a class of its own, Gulf Bank is better positioned for success
than any of its peers'. Burgan Bank is more of a state-owned institution
with the government owning a majority of the shares.
Capital Intelligence last summer raised Gulf Bank's long-term rating from
BBB+ to A on the strength of its 1992 results. The 1993 figures released on
February 9 have vindicated CI's assessment. Gulf Bank increased 1993 profits
by 22 per cent to KD18.2m (Dollars 61.1m) compared with the previous year.
Total assets were up 7 per cent to KD1.25bn (Dollars 4.2bn), of which some
half was in government debt bonds; cash, short-term funds and treasury bills
30 per cent; loans and advances just under 20 per cent. These last were up
47 per cent to KD237m, mostly from international lending. Any increase in
domestic lending was at the expense of the other four commercial banks.
The three banks most frequently mentioned as 'merger candidates' are
Al-Ahli, Bank of Kuwait &amp; the Middle East, and Commercial Bank of Kuwait.
Although the government is a majority shareholder of both Burgan and BKME,
the central bank governor Sheikh Salem al-Sabah made clear in a February 9
interview that he would not force banks to merge. Any decision of this
nature, he said, would have to be taken by their boards.
The prospect of finding a foreign partner is remote. Foreign banks are
unlikely to put their feet into Kuwait's stagnant waters even if a proposal
to let foreign companies acquire up to 40 per cent of Kuwaiti companies were
to be approved by the national assembly. Judging by the emotional response
to this issue in a debate on February 9, it will be a long time before
Kuwait's parliament comes near to approving such an idea.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (2): The unfamiliar taste of austerity -
Mark Nicholson examines the reactions to spending cuts in a welfare
super-state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some unfamiliar calls - in Kuwait at least - have recently been emanating
from the finance ministry and central bank. They are calls for sacrifices,
belt-tightening and austerity, and they are being couched in uncommonly
pointed terms.
Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister, last month spoke of reform
measures requiring 'sacrifices on all levels' and the 'urgent need' to
undertake 'structural' changes to government spending. He suggested Kuwait
should look to cut spending in its 1994-95 budget by 20 per cent.
Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, the governor of the central bank, amplified such
thoughts. 'I'll be after more than a 20 per cent cut in spending,' he said.
'The problem is the structural imbalances in the budget.'
What is unfamiliar about such talk is, first, that it is being uttered at
all. This is a result of the fact that soft world oil prices, the fiscal
legacy of the Gulf war and reconstruction after it, the impending repayment
of Kuwait's foreign debt, big arms purchases and towering recurrent costs in
the government's accounts have combined to put an unsustainable squeeze on
state coffers.
So tight is the squeeze that Kuwait's government now feels forced to signal
the abandonment of its time-honoured role as unblinking provider to one of
the world's most featherbedded welfare states, and raise the alarm.
But it is also new for the government to feel it has to issue such signals
so publicly. It is doing so because it is preparing the ground for what
looks set to become the most contentious and difficult budget debate in
Kuwait's history.
In April, when spending cuts and service fee increases are expected to be
included in Kuwait's 1994-1995 budget proposals, they will have to be
approved by the opposition-dominated National Assembly. The government
appears to believe, with some justice, that Kuwait's newly empowered MPs
will need a good deal of softening up before they can be convinced to pass
measures which, for the first time in Kuwait's recent history, will promise
an overall erosion of the state's plethora of benefits.
The case for some belt-tightening is pressing. Kuwait's official budget  -
which omits defence spending, debt repayments and investment income - for
1993-94 envisaged a KD1.5bn fiscal deficit. This is already off track.
According to Mr al-Rodhan, the budget deficit already stood at 67 per cent
of the projected total for the June-July financial year at midpoint in
January. Moreover, the initial budget estimates were based on projected oil
revenues, comprising 89 per cent of total government income, and assumed
output of 1.75m barrels a day at Dollars 14 a barrel. Weak oil prices since
have forced the government to revise this basis to Dollars 10.5 a barrel on
output of more than 2m b/d - which implies a considerable cut in income.
As good luck, and some good management, would have it, Kuwait appears likely
to be able to finance the 1993-94 deficit from its own resources. Domestic
treasury bill sales will fund part of the gap, but the lion's share is
likely to come from the investment income of the Kuwait Investment
Authority, which oversees Kuwait's still substantial overseas investments
portfolio. Although Kuwait's holdings of just under Dollars 100bn were
slashed to between Dollars 35bn-Dollars 40bn to pay for Gulf war costs, the
world's buoyant equity markets over the past year are understood to have
given KIA a return of at least 20 per cent on these holdings for 1993.
But the real problems lie in the next two to three years. In 1995 the
government is due to start the first principal repayments on the Dollars
5.5bn jumbo loan it took out on international markets to tide it through its
immediate post-war needs.
This will immediately add commitments of at least Dollars 2.7bn both in 1995
and 1996, commitments which, says Sheikh Salem, Kuwait will certainly meet.
Since Kuwait cannot easily bet on firmer oil prices - particularly with the
prospect of an eventual return of Iraqi oil on the horizon - or continued
bullishness in world equities, the government has little choice but to
tighten control of spending and revenues at home.
Government committees are understood now to be examining what measures can
be taken. Nothing definitive has yet been tabled. But the finance ministry
and central bank are making it known that the government wage bill, which
accounts alone for 52 per cent of total spending, is under review, as are
the quite enormous subsidies on power and water. Defence spending, which to
date has been kept firmly off budget, might also be hauled in for
reconsideration. Only the latter is likely to win much sympathy from the
National Assembly.
But while the government wrestles to control its own financial problems, it
is forced also to consider those of Kuwait's despondent private sector -
which historically has depended almost entirely on government spending to
sustain it. According to Sheikh Salem, Kuwait's non-oil economy has shrunk
by 33 per cent since before the Gulf war.
The causes of this shrinkage are manifold. They include the effects of war
damage, the decline in domestic markets as a result of Kuwait's policy of
reducing its population, the banks' reluctance to commit credit to
businessmen until Kuwait's 'difficult debt' programme is definitively
resolved and, perhaps as much as anything, a crippling lack of confidence
among Kuwaiti investors themselves.
The private sector will be hard for the government to ignore, since
otherwise there is little prospect that Kuwait's economy will be capable of
absorbing the additional 5,000-6,000 Kuwaitis who enter the labour force
every year. The bloated public sector, which already employs 96 per cent of
all employed Kuwaiti nationals, is not set to grow in the next two to three
years, whatever the oil price does, and cannot conceivably absorb
efficiently the new cohorts of young Kuwaitis.
Faced with a lack of initiative from domestic investors, the government has
therefore turned to foreign investment as a potential palliative, and is
entertaining with increasing seriousness the prospect of privatisation.
The government's offset programme (discussed on page IV of this survey) has
already won hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign investment
commitments, though as yet few firm projects. The government is also
cautiously discussing the possibility of inviting foreign investment in the
banking sector and small parts of the domestic downstream petroleum
industry.
But Kuwait's caution towards foreign investment - it is a highly emotive
topic among parliamentarians - places it at a considerable disadvantage in
the Gulf where places such as Dubai, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have long
since introduced packages of incentives for foreign investors including free
zones, tax breaks and subsidised finance. Tax on foreign companies in
Kuwait, as an instance of comparison, presently stand at a highly
discouraging 55 per cent.
A programme of privatisation is also being considered, within the framework
of a lengthy World Bank study which concluded that Kuwait has little choice
but to divest itself of state holdings if it is to create an environment of
economic growth, let alone get its own financial house in order.
Some early steps are being taken. By the end of this year, the pioneering
telecommunications ministry expects to be in a position to float 51 per cent
of the telephone system in a public offering. The KIA is studying the
divestment of its holdings in more than 60 Kuwaiti companies, most of them
picked up during the state mop-up of debts following the 1982 stock market
crash.
But it is early days for the privatisation programme and a considerable
amount of preparation is required before local or foreign investors are
likely to want to bite. And all such preparation is liable to provoke
political opposition. Sales of public utilities or aspects of the health
services would require a rise in service fees, which would face strong
opposition. Privatisation itself would almost certainly require short-term
job cuts in what are presently cossetted public sector areas.
Little wonder, with such prospective political battles ahead, that the
government is sounding shriller about Kuwait's economic straits.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (3): An investment backwater - The Kuwait
stock exchange has its limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is the good news: according to official figures, the 1993 average daily
volume of share transactions of the 47 companies listed on the Kuwait stock
exchange was 13m-14m with an average daily value of Dollars 11m. In terms of
both value and volume, these figures represent twice those recorded in 1989,
the last full year before the Iraqi invasion of August 1990.
Here is the bad news: in 1989 the Kuwait stock market was almost moribund,
moving barely one per cent. The government owned more than 50 per cent of
all the listed shares. Today, through the Kuwait Investment Authority and
other agencies, it owns, according to Mr Hilal al-Mutairi, director-general
of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry, over 45 per cent of the
total market capitalisation of some Dollars 11.5bn. KIA alone owns 20-25 per
cent of the market, according to its managing director, Mr Ali Rashaid
al-Bader.
If the government tried to get rid of its shares to the private sector given
the present levels of turnover, it would take many years if the market was
not to collapse, according to one accountant. In 1989 some 70 per cent of
all daily trading was in six bank stocks out of the 42 different companies
spread across eight sectors. This year, in the week ending February 9, the
banking sector, comprising stocks of eight banks, accounted for 63.8 per
cent of total traded value, according to Alshall Economic Consultants.
These eight banks collectively represented 46.2 per cent of traded volume.
The trading in just two banks, National Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Finance
House, represented 52.3 per cent of all traded value.
In short, the market is almost irrelevant as a barometer of economic health
or as a source of new money.
According to a Kuwaiti industrialist, people are holding on to their money,
waiting to see whether the government is actually capable of pushing through
a privatisation programme and deregulating the economy.
'I feel as though we are sailing on a ship with no compass,' said the
industrialist. 'The government has no plan except to set up more committees.
We are lost with all these committees.'
But there was also a good side. 'There are plenty of good Kuwaitis,
intelligent and hard-working, who know what needs to be done, but who are
forced to wait for a government which can't apply itself. Privatisation
cannot be applied by bureaucrats. I have never seen, in a third-world
country which ours is, a government employee willing to leave his office on
someone else's behalf.'
The private sector possibly has more than Dollars 60bn abroad, perhaps half
that of Saudi Arabia, a businessman with 17 years experience in Kuwait
suggested. 'But for what would the private sector repatriate its funds? Only
for the opportunity to make more money at home.'
There is only one listed company, Mobile Telephone Systems Co., 49 per cent
of which is owned by the public, whose shares are actively traded - 5.2 per
cent of volume and 13 per cent of value in the first week of February -
which is likely to attract the attention of investors.
So far it fulfils all three criteria for a successful public issue. These
are, suggested Mr al-Mutairi, timing; state of the market and profitability
of the company; and quality of management advising the privatisation
programme. But the most important element is the government's political
will. In the case of Mobile Telephone Systems Co, it appears to be present.
By contrast, Kuwait Airways Corporation, another candidate for privatisation
singled out by a government-appointed committee which this month made its
recommendations to the finance ministry, does not fulfil at least one of the
three basic criteria. On top of which one businessman said: 'I doubt whether
any airline in the region is genuinely profitable in a full commercial
sense.'
But the government may be forced to privatise at moments not of its own
choosing. Keeping nationals in government jobs has simply become too
expensive.
It takes some 70 per cent of the annual national income - and some 75 per
cent of gross domestic product according to the Central Bank governor Sheikh
Salem al-Sabah - to pay public sector wages and salaries to Kuwaitis, 93 per
cent of whom work for the government. Moreover, 6,000-7,000 nationals join
the labour market every year.
But the government's inertia is not the only problem. The national assembly
is suspicious of any shake-up which might attract non-Kuwaitis at the
expense of nationals.
In the meantime, the stock exchange stands idle, grand and gaunt behind its
black marble facade, waiting for serious business.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (1): An anxious reawakening - Three years
after the end of the Iraqi occupation, Kuwait has made great strides on the
road to recovery. It enjoys greater security, oil is flowing, and politics
are thriving. But it has underlying problems which have yet to be addressed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kuwait is rebuilt. Its oil industry, the fountain of its wealth, is restored
to pre-Gulf war vigour.
Political life has resumed and is thriving in the polished halls of the most
powerful elected assembly in Kuwait's history and, indeed, anywhere in the
Gulf. The state's defence is underwritten by pacts with the Gulf war allies
which liberated Kuwait from seven months of Iraqi occupation three years ago
almost to the day. All should be well.
But it is not. Rather than dwelling on the accomplishments of reconstruction
Kuwaitis are instead looking ahead, and with profound uncertainty. The Iraqi
occupation has left an economic and political legacy which Kuwaitis are
beginning to address only now that the basic tasks of rebuilding are
complete.
Two factors above all have conspired to raise troubling questions about the
future. The first is the sheer financial cost of the war, which rudely
tugged away the previously deep cushion of wealth which allowed Kuwaitis to
enjoy one of the world's most generous welfare states.
Kuwait's greater dependence on oil revenues since the occupation ravaged the
non-oil sector, and the prospects of low crude prices for the foreseeable
future, have sharpened questions of how - indeed whether - Kuwaitis can
continue enjoying the panoply of cradle-to-grave benefits most have come to
regard as a birthright.
The political effects of the war are more complex, but strike at the heart
of how Kuwait will manage a transition to life in reduced circumstances.
Popular demands for greater democracy in Kuwait which Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah,
the emir, was forced to meet after the war resulted in the election in
October 1992 of an opposition-dominated National Assembly, the first to be
elected since the emir dissolved the previous assembly in 1986.
The new parliament has ever since been diligently nibbling away at the
ruling al-Sabah family's governing power. But the resultant tug-of-war
between a parliament intent on proving itself indispensable to the proper
governance of Kuwait and a ruling family reluctant to cede too much of its
historical authority has led to a crisis of leadership. Kuwait's
uncomfortable dilemma is that this crisis threatens to create a political
impasse just when the state's economic problems are demanding tough,
immediate decisions.
Away from this continuing political tussle and the uncertainties it has
provoked, however, Kuwait can point to some considerable and concrete
post-war gains. For example, although its Dollars 11.7bn rearmament
programme is unlikely to make Kuwait much more defensible than it proved in
1990, defence pacts with the US, Britain, France and Russia have provided a
far more overt and less ambiguous security framework than existed before the
war.
On the domestic economic front, Kuwait's commanding institutions have
weathered grave crises and emerged arguably more strongly and accountably
managed. In the oil sector, for instance, Kuwait has not only been able
rapidly to resume pre-war output of more than 2m barrels a day, but has
stubbornly battled back to what it considers its rightful oil allocation and
position of power within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The industry is now proceeding with plans to increase capacity above 3m b/d
to position Kuwait for future Opec haggling and, perhaps, oil market
opportunities as they arise.
The Kuwait Investment Authority, custodian of an overseas investments
portfolio which remains Kuwait's second biggest source of income, has also
regained confidence after the shock of its fire-sale of holdings to fund the
war and the embarrassing revelations of alleged corruption and mismanagement
in its Spanish investments.
Mr Ali Rashid al-Badr, the KIA's post-war managing director, is reluctant to
discuss alleged scandals, which he says are a matter for courts in Spain and
London where former Kuwait Investment Office managers are facing civil and
criminal charges: 'The Spanish affair I put behind me more than a year ago,'
he says.
Instead, KIA managers point to a bumper year in 1993, when buoyant world
markets earned a 20 per cent return on its residual investment portfolio of
around Dollars 35bn-Dollars 40bn.
Another success lies in last year's agreement on plans to settle the 12
year-old problem of KD5.5bn worth of bad debts left, primarily, by the 1982
collapse of the unsupervised Souk al-Manakh stock market.
But the most striking achievement since the war - though not all of Kuwait's
ruling elite may see it so - has been the full-blooded return of
democratically based politics in Kuwait.
In the context of feudal Gulf politics and even of Kuwait's own historically
feisty political tradition, the National Assembly's accomplishments in
little over a year have been startling.
Parliament has doggedly negotiated new laws protecting public funds; it has
for the first time won access to the accounts of all government-held
companies; it was the driving force behind settlement of the bad debt
problem. Perhaps most remarkably, in the face of strong ruling family
pressure it forced the trial before a criminal court in Kuwait of Sheikh Ali
Khalifa, the former oil and finance minister facing charges of embezzlement
from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Company.
Parliament is, says Mr Jassem al-Saddoun, an economic adviser to the
assembly, now 'supervising the government in every sector'. He and others in
the assembly are confident other victories lie ahead - like having the
government reveal defence spending on its published budget for the first
time, where it can then be debated, and perhaps even cut.
But just such creeping parliamentary power, particularly in economic
affairs, is contributing to Kuwait's present uncertainty. The Kuwaiti
exchequer, drained by post war spending of perhaps Dollars 100bn, facing
possibly prolonged weakness in oil prices and in the next two years saddled
additionally with annual repayments exceeding Dollars 2.7bn on post-war
borrowing, is felt by the finance ministry, the central bank and the KIA to
be under unsustainable pressure.
Each has been issuing recent statements to the effect that government
spending has to be cut, revenues raised, or both. 'We have to have austerity
measures, this is inevitable,' says Mr al-Badr.
Such talk in boundlessly cossetted pre-war Kuwait would have been
unthinkable. The difficulty is that the previously unthinkable may also
prove unpassable. The National Assembly has already voiced strong resistance
to any suggestions of foreign investment in the banking sector, raising
emotional cries of 'neocolonialism'. And few observers, in parliament and
outside, believe popularity-conscious MPs would readily endorse measures
which might affect public sector salaries (96 per cent of employed Kuwaitis
work for the government), or raise the prices of power or water.
The prospect of a government-parliament impasse over such crucial economic
decisions is a source of deep frustration among many Kuwaitis - particularly
among merchant and business leaders who argue they can make few commercial
decisions until there is a firm determination of economic policy. At
present, says Mr al-Saddoun, 'there is no economic policy whatsoever'.
But political leadership is in short supply. Parliament is so far largely
incapable of creating policy, lacking either the resources or expertise.
Moreover, it regards its role, for the present at least, essentially as a
watchdog.
The government itself, led by Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and
prime minister, has in the view of a growing number of Kuwaitis proved
itself capable only of paralysing attempts at consensus-building.
As Mr Abdulla al-Nibari, an opposition MP, puts it: 'All of Kuwait's savings
will have to dry up before we face the problem. It will take that.'

Shares in British Aerospace retreated sharply, falling 47 to 502p, after
analysts downgraded earnings per share expectations for the current year,
following a second more detailed results meeting with the company. The
changes of recommendation followed the revelation of a higher than
anticipated tax charge.
Mr Paul Ruddle at NatWest Securities reduced his current year EPS forecast
from 31.5p to 19.3p and made a cut for the following year from 55.4p to
37.6p. Mr Chris Avery at Paribas reduced his current year forecast by a
penny to 34p, and the 1995 figure by 8p to 50p.
A retreat in Thorn EMI, which reported good results on Tuesday, saw the
shares slide 40 to 1100p on profit-taking and continuing concern over the
company's caution towards analysts wanting to upgrade their profit
forecasts. The stock was also the subject of a multimedia warrant from SG
Warburg, with a 30 per cent weighting along with Pearson at 28 per cent.
Four European media stocks make up the rest of the basket. Pearson shares
fell 17 to 685p.
Drinks stocks held up well in the weak market, although dealers attributed
this to their recent underperformance rather than a more fundamental reason.
Bass jumped 8 on news of a marketing agreement with Grolsch, before closing
5 down at 520p. Grand Metropolitan moved in the reverse direction, being hit
badly in the morning as Swiss food giant Nestle tumbled in Zurich on talk of
a profits warning. This later turned out to be merely a number of analysts
downgrades and GrandMet recovered to close 4 off at 457p.
Drugs and DIY group Boots was the best performing stores stock, the shares
staying firm at 534p with 3.7m traded. Dealers said Kleinwort Benson was
recommending the stock, with a target price of 600p. UBS was also positive.
Good two-way business in Burton saw the shares edge up a half-penny to 51
3/4 p with 12m traded.
There was takeover talk around Bernard Matthews, lifting the shares
initially. They ended 3 down at 110p. Hazlewood Foods held up to close just
2 down at 153p ahead of an analysts visit today.
Tumbling Hong Kong stocks hit several related shares in London. HSBC fell 54
to 941p, Cable &amp; Wireless 11 to 469p and Standard Chartered 36 to 1224p.
UK airports operator BAA was the only stock in the FT-SE 100 to hold out
against the poor market trend, boosted by an upbeat Department of Transport
forecast on air travel and general bargain hunting.
The shares, which have underperformed the market by 3 per cent over the last
month, closed 4 ahead at 977p with 2.5m traded. The DoT suggests that
traffic at the group's airport will show an average growth rate of 3.1 to
5.5 per cent between 1992 and 2010.
Royal Insurance rose in pre-market trading after posting figures within the
mid-range of forecasts and a higher than expected dividend but fell back
later with the sector, which is heavily geared to the performance of the
stock market. Royals closed 12 off at 278p, Commercial Union 13 off at 603p
and Sun Alliance 14 off at 339p.
The Telegraph improved 7 to 587p following news of a 15.5 per cent jump
profits to Pounds 53.7m before exceptionals.
Buying pressure and takeover speculation again surrounded Carrs Milling, the
shares gaining 8 to 217p.

FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shock Pounds 1.65bn of restructuring and a dividend that disappointed more
people than it pleased ensured that British Gas was the most heavily traded
stock in London. The shares fell 11 to 328p with more than 20m shares
traded.
The 14.5p dividend represented the first time that British Gas had not
increased its pay-out to shareholders since the company was privatised. Ms
Irene Himona of SGST argued that gains from overseas expansion will not
compensate for the loss of UK earnings as its monopoly is eroded. Some
analysts said that the dividend was the best that could be hoped for but
that the write-downs for 25,000 job cuts were twice as high as expected, and
the estimated benefits from those job cuts were lower than forecast.
Fourth-quarter figures from Shell Transport and continental European arm
Royal Dutch prompted a sharp sell-off in both classes of shares as investors
reacted to a lower than expected dividend.
The UK dividend of 13.8p satisfied the market but the Royal Dutch pay-out of
Fl 8.60 was below the lowest forecasts. NatWest Securities oil analyst
Fergus McLeod said the Pounds 776m net income was below his forecast and he
was maintaining a comparatively low Pounds 3.3bn forecast for this year.
However, Brendan Wilders of Hoare Govett turned buyer with a Pounds 3.7bn
forecast arguing that the company was masking solid progress on the recovery
story and was not too geared to oil prices. Shell Transport fell 23 to 699p
with heavy turnover of 6.6m shares and Royal Dutch dropped Fl 5.7 to Fl
202.7.

FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Squeeze keeps ICI steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Keenly awaited full-year figures from ICI disappointed the market yesterday,
although the shares found some support from dividend buyers.
ICI announced a profit of Pounds 290m which was towards the bottom of the
analysts' range. This was accompanied by a trading statement which was seen
by most analysts as neutral to cautious. The shares fell 12 but then, to
general surprise, turned the corner. While the rest of the FT-SE 100 was off
by more than 65 points ICI was one of only three bright spots. It appeared
that income funds, which buy stocks for the yield, were holding on for the
dividend on March 14. This prompted a squeeze as a number of marketmakers
had gone short ahead of the figures. There was also expectation of some US
demand after the company's presentation in New York on Friday.
Nevertheless, most UK analysts were unimpressed and some of the higher 1994
forecasts were reduced. James Capel and Kleinwort Benson came down to around
Pounds 400m from Pounds 440m and Pounds 450m. One of the few securities
houses to continue enthusiastic was Smith New Court which remains on Pounds
400m for this year and Pounds 700m for 1995, but argues 'there are the first
signs of a real culture change in ICI.' It also reinforced its buy
recommendation. However, the shares were finally unable to resist the
general pressure and closed a net 2 lower at 750p.

FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

Fears on US interest rates prompted the biggest one day retreat in stock
index futures for more than six years as the March contract crashed through
the 3,300 level in heavy trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
At the official close, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at 3,246
having traded as low as 3,241 earlier in the session, around 100 points
below its previous close.
The firm opening at 3,307 initially indicated a steady if poor day and a few
buyers at the start of trading pushed March to 3,311. But the weakness in
the bond markets sparked a sell off sending March sliding lower for most of
the session. Mr Neil Treloar at NatWest Markets said: 'We had one eye on the
gilts and the other on German bunds. It was hectic selling.'
At the official close March was at a 22 point discount to cash, though
further selling in after hours trading widened the discount. Volume was a
hefty 30,817 contracts.
The traded options also had one of its busiest day's in recent sessions as
turnover rose to 74,821 contracts. Some 33,973 lots were dealt in the FT-SE
100 contract and 12,229 was traded in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. British Gas
was the busiest option with a total of 11,264 lots.
Volume in the mid FTSE futures traded on the OMLX was poor with a mere 131
lots dealt by the close.

FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fears of US rate rise send shares
sharply down - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the US Federal Reserve might tighten interest rates again sooner
than expected drove the FT-SE Index down by 74.4 points yesterday in its
largest one day fall for sixteen months. The setback, which was sparked by
substantial losses in bonds as London and continental Europe followed trends
in US Federal securities, featured heavy selling of stock index futures
rather than of the underlying equities.
The favoured support level of 3,300 on the Footsie was swept aside just
before noon when traders grew increasingly apprehensive ahead of publication
of the latest statistics on US durable goods orders, which Mr Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared to have identified
as a significant inflation counter earlier this week.
The FT-SE Index closed at 3,267.5, just above the day's worst, but with no
effective recovery in either gilts or equities after US markets took a
negative view of the durable goods figures. Wall Street was nearly 40 points
down as London closed for the day.
The wave of interest rate nervousness hit particularly hard in London, where
the stock market has virtually factored in another cut in domestic base
rates. Traders reminded one another that Mr Nick Knight, the once bullish
strategist at Nomura Securities, had warned this week that UK short term
interest rates would be above 6 per cent, perhaps approaching 7 per cent by
the end of the year.
But Seaq volume, at 753.9m shares, was unexceptional, not even matching the
822.4m of the previous session. One leading broker said he had found it very
difficult to find even one big institutional seller of either gilts or
equities.
Nor were strategists agreed on the rationale behind the interest rate fears.
'Not a chance,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon said, when asked if
UK short term rates were about to rise.
At James Capel, London's leading institutional broker, Mr Paul Walton
assured clients that this was 'an opportunity to buy the UK equity market
considerably cheaper than it was yesterday.' He also found 'completely
unconvincing' suggestions that interest rates are about to rise in Europe.
One view was that yesterday was a delayed rationalisation of the correction
in UK equities which has been taking place since the Footsie peaked at the
beginning of this month. The focus on the stock index future brought hints
that hedge funds may have suffered large losses in that market and become
forced sellers of bonds and shares.
With nervousness over interest rates turning attention towards corporate
results, the market was not helped by discouraging on sales and profit
pressures from the boardroom of ICI, although shares in the blue chip
chemical group held steady following the results. Shell, reporting lower
results yesterday, fell sharply and added to the general malaise.
The final picture last night was gloomy, with pressure across the range of
equities bringing a fall of 51.9 to 3,923 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. UK
traders are still resigned to further tightening of policy by the Federal
Reserve at some point, and are also watching Wall Street with some misgiving
ahead of the opening of London markets today. But bond markets are expected
to continue holding the key to near- term developments in equities.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volatile trading seen on the
continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bond markets again had a heavy influence on trading yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
Merill Lynch has dropped its exposure to lower interest rates as a major
strategy theme. 'The lack of a positive response to last week's rate cut (in
Germany) adds weight to the view that rates are falling but everybody now
expects it. We have reduced weightings in France and Spain and increased
weightings in the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway'.
FRANKFURT retreated after Wednesday's gains with the futures market again
providing most of the impetus to the day's activity. The Dax index tumbled
37.38 or 1.7 per cent to 2,090.20 and the March Dax contract by 65.5 to
2,083.0.
In the after market the Ibis indicated index lost 57.4 to 2,082.89.
The market seemed unmoved by inflation data from the state of Hesse which
came in much within expectations.
Among individual issues, Man, which announced a fall in six-month group
sales of 7.9 per cent and an increase in orders of 16 per cent slipped DM5
to DM420.
Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction company, followed the broader market
lower, losing DM8 to DM930, in spite of reporting that it expected to pay a
dividend on 1993 results.
ZURICH tumbled 2.3 per cent, as it registered disappointment at results from
SMH, the watchmaker, which had climbed strongly in the previous two
sessions, and worries over the earnings outlook at Nestle.
The SMI index fell 69.1 to 2,958.4, amid selling by foreign investors taking
advantage of the strong franc. Results this morning from UBS are seen as
crucial to setting the market's direction in coming days.
SMH registered fell SFr18 or 8.3 per cent to SFr198 in response to news,
after the market closed on Wednesday, that 1993 group net profit rose by a
smaller than expected 7 per cent. The day's fall more than wiped out the
rises of the previous two sessions on news that Mercedes Benz was to
co-operate in the development of the Swatchmobile.
Nestle shed SFr53 or 3.9 per cent to SFr1,296 after some analysts revised
down their e/ps forecasts. Remarks by the company at a food conference in
Arizona that it did not plan a share listing in the US for the time being
also prompted some US sales.
UBS shed SFr21 to SFr1,451, giving up some of recent rises, as analysts
suggested that anything less that a 60 per cent rise in 1993 profits would
prove a big disappointment to the market.
PARIS reacted negatively to news of the Bank of France's 10 basis point cut
in the intervention rate to 6.10 per cent, and then fell below the 2,200
level, before rising by the close. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's
low of 2,178.24 closed off 43.71 or 1.9 per cent at 2,208.29.
Pechiney, which said that it was to cut aluminium output in Europe by 87,000
tonnes, lost FFr2.50 to FFr439.50.
Metaleurop, a division of Preussag of Germany, which saw a doubling of its
losses in the 1992/93 period to end of September held steady at FFr89.50.
The company commented that the worst might now be over.
AMSTERDAM suffered from disappointing results from Royal Dutch which left
the stock down Fl 5.70 at Fl 202.70. This left the AEX index off 7.50 or 1.7
per cent at 418.31.
Unilever continued to be depressed by its poor results earlier in the week,
the stock falling another Fl 6.00 to Fl 213.50, while Akzo softened Fl 7.50
to Fl 207.50 ahead of results expected out today.
Grolsch, the brewer, was, with Heineken, among the few stocks to go against
the market, the former rising Fl 2.30 or 5.4 per cent to Fl 44.50 and the
latter Fl 1.00 to Fl 229.50. Grolsch has signed an agreement with UK brewer
Bass to produce and distribute its product in the UK.
MILAN continued on its downward path, swept along by the wave of selling
elsewhere in Europe and with the forthcoming elections proving a further
disincentive. The Comit index shed 14.06 or 2.1 per cent to 655.66.
BCI bucked the trend, picking up L137 or 2.4 per cent to L5,873, after its
falls in recent sessions. Actinvest, an independent research group, expected
the privatisation price, to be set tomorrow, to be around L5,000.
MADRID fell 1.6 per cent, depressed by weak bonds, and the general index
shed 5.56 to 337.29.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks falter after
failure of merger talks
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks tumbled yesterday after the collapse of Bell Atlantic's proposed
merger with Tele-Communications and another rout on the bond market, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 51.78, or about 1.3 per cent,
to 3,839.90, its lowest level since closing at 3,820.77 on January 7. Late
in the session the Dow's move beyond the 50-point range triggered
restrictions on program-trading.
The sell-off was broad-based, with declines outnumbering advances by 1,809
to 434. The breadth of the downturn was reflected in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500, which shed 6.43 to 464.26. The American SE composite was down 6.16 to
465.58 while the technology-rich Nasdaq composite sank 9.67 to 779.44.
NYSE volume, at 344m shares, was heavy.
Stocks were sent reeling by Bell Atlantic's decision to terminate its
planned acquisition of Tele-Communications after months of fruitless
negotiations. The bellwether merger, the largest ever proposed, was expected
to spur the development of interactive communications services which were to
form the foundation of a new 'information superhighway'. Investors feared
the breakdown would lead to the scuttling of some of the other proposed
link-ups between telephone and media groups agreed since the Bell Atlantic
pact was unveiled last autumn. But the losses on the Big Board were spread
across a range of sectors, partly because of another sharp drop in bond
prices on fears over interest rates. General Motors shed Dollars 1 to
Dollars 59, Caterpillar was Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 108 5/8 and DuPont
fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 53 1/4 . Trading in Bell Atlantic shares was
delayed at the opening because of an order imbalance. When it resumed,
stocks climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 54 1/2 . On the Nasdaq, TCI's A
shares sank Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 .
Communications and cable-equipment companies were particularly hard hit by
the announcement, which was made after the markets closed on Wednesday
evening.
Latin America
Brazilian markets were battered for a second straight day by rumours -
subsequently denied - that the economic stabilisation would curb foreign
investment in stocks day. The Sao Paulo Bovespa index lost 651 points, or
6.1 per cent, to 9,979 and the Rio de Janeiro exchange dropped 2,930 points,
or 7.3 per cent.
Argentine share prices, stricken by a selling panic in the afternoon,
trimmed their earlier losses in the local stock exchange, traders said.
The Merval index ended 3.5 per cent off at 656.81 points.
Mexican stocks recovered after being down almost 3 per cent at midday.
According to preliminary official information, the key IPC index was up
19.98 points at 2,592.33 - a gain of 0.78 per cent - at the close.
Canada
Toronto shares tumbled in moderate trading.
The TSE 300 composite index lost 39.23 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 4,329.12
in volume of 68.29m shares. Trading value was CDollars 909.6m.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Portugal is set to resume an upward
path - Falling interest rates are encouraging further equity investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After soaring gains throughout 1993 and early this year, analysts have
welcomed this week's correction on the Lisbon bourse as a means of cleaning
up a market that was becoming dominated by speculation rather than serious
investment.
'A market that moves up in virtually a straight line for more than a year
cannot be considered healthy,' says Ms Elizabeth Rothfield, an analyst with
independent stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'A spell of profit-taking is
needed to put the market back on a more realistic footing.'
But the correction is unlikely to be dramatic. The Banco Totta &amp; Acores
index fell from a two-year high of 3,226.6 last Friday to 3,161.8 on
Wednesday. Analysts will be satisfied if the correction reaches 5 per cent.
But they are unsure prices will move down even that far.
Liquidity is driving the bourse forward. Interest rates on medium and long
term government debt securities, the traditional home of Portuguese
institutional investment, have fallen from 14 per cent last May to 8.5 per
cent. As a result, an increasing proportion of portfolios has been channeled
into equity.
This weight of money of money drove the BTA index up by 59.6 per cent in
1993 to 2,614 and it has already put on a further 20 per cent this year.
Analysts forecast a overall gain of 20 to 30 per cent in 1994 on a
substantially higher turnover. Lisbon's trading volume rose by 97 per cent
last year to Es2,849bn (Dollars 16bn) while the value of the market more
than doubled to Es2,193bn.
This week's correction was triggered by a rise of 20 basis points in medium
and long-term government debt rates after the Bank of Portugal failed to
place all of a massive Es150bn issue of three, five, and 10 year paper. But
the outlook is for a resumption of the downward trend in interest rates,
which are expected to fall to about 7 per cent by December.
The fact that the domestic institutions, which now dominate the stock
market, are more nervous than their foreign counterparts is also
contributing to the current correction. But they are also so bullish about
the market overall that they are more often looking for excuses to buy.
'When investors in Portugal start asking you about inflation rates in Japan
or the latest budget news from the US it becomes clear that they are not
overly concerned with the fundamentals of their own economy or the
performance of the companies they are investing in,' says Ms Rothfield.
'They take the attitude that they must invest and are buying into good
quality companies even though they may be overpriced.'
In fact, the outlook for the economy is relatively buoyant. After a
recession in 1993 when output fell by an expected 0.75 per cent, the economy
is likely to expand by about 1.5 per cent this year. Investors are already
discounting forecasts of improved corporate performance in 1995, when gross
domestic product growth could reach 3 per cent.
Mr Ernani Lopes, a former finance minister, this week told a London seminar
that Portugal's main corporate problems over the medium term will be
increasing competition in domestic and foreign markets, affecting market
shares and profit margins. Industry will also undergo a radical
restructuring process at both sectorial and company levels.
This will provide opportunities for takeovers of distressed companies and
partnerships, he says. The shakeout will also produce portfolio investment
opportunities, which will need to be based on adequate research and sound
local advice.
After returning higher than expected profits last year, the banking sector,
which accounts for 65 per cent of equity turnover, will face greater
difficulties in 1994, including bad debt, stronger competition, decreasing
spreads and the need to cut costs.
Mr Antonio de Sousa, secretary of state for finance, says that government
plans to speed up the privatisation process will be a further stimulus.
After completing the planned denationalisation of the financial sector, he
believes the privatisation of industrial companies and public utilities this
year will increase the equity market turnover of privatised companies from
31 per cent of the total in 1993 to more than 50 per cent this year.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances 2.2% as
Hong Kong falls sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Reports that the US would tolerate a weaker yen depressed the Japanese
currency against the dollar, and the Nikkei average closed up 2.2 per cent
on active dealer and arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 gained 423.65 to 19,765.48 after opening at a low of
19,389.24 and reaching a high of 19,792.28 in the afternoon session. The
Topix index of all first section stocks rose 29.77 to 1,607.62 while the
Nikkei 300 rose 5.69 to 297.52.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 6.62 to 1,328.22.
Share prices initially rose on strong buying by foreign investors, followed
by arbitrage buying. Activity was triggered by the fall of the yen to the
Y106 level on reports that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, had
made comments in favour of a weaker yen. A Japanese finance ministry
official later denied the report in the early afternoon.
Mr Yutaka Nakai at Daiwa Securities said that share prices would remain
stable ahead of the March 11 settlements for Nikkei futures contracts as
long as the yen did not strengthen against the dollar. 'Whether arbitrageurs
will roll over their positions or not will depend on the currency.'
Volume rose to 470m shares against 274m. Gainers overwhelmed losers by 975
to 94, with 108 issues remaining unchanged.
Hopes of a bottoming out in earnings boosted electronics issues. Hitachi,
the most active issue of the day, rose Y18 to Y915 on foreign buying and
Toshiba rose Y9 to Y747. Sony advanced Y160 to Y6,300. Reports that the
company would sell Columbia, its movie company, at a profit also attracted
buyers in spite of denials by company officials.
Nippon Suisan, the fishery group, rose Y26 to Y417 on reports that the
company has developed a technology to refine a fatty acid found in fish oil

Roundup
Some sharp falls were seen in regional markets.
HONG KONG finished 3.1 per cent lower on renewed selling triggered by the
decision to press ahead with local political reforms. The Hang Seng index
tumbled 331.21 to 10,432.02.
Most blue chips suffered from the late sell-off. HSBC Holdings, the most
actively traded stock, slid HKDollars 2 to finish at HKDollars 115 while its
Hang Seng Bank unit fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 70.50. Cheung Kong shed
HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 43.50 and Jardine Matheson lost HKDollars 3.50
to HKDollars 68.50.
SINGAPORE fell 1.6 per cent in reaction to the government's failure to cut
corporate taxes in the 1994-95 budget. The Straits Times Industrials index
fell 38.67 to 2,385.24 but was off an intra-day low of 2,376.06.
SEOUL was dragged down by a sell-off of blue chips and worries about
liquidity constraints. The composite stock index closed 17.86 down at
932.15.
MANILA declined for the fourth straight day, weighed down by the proposed
doubling of a stock transaction tax. The composite index slid 39.94 to
2,956.27.
PLDT lost 45 pesos at 2,090 pesos after an overnight fall in New York while
Philippine National Bank shed 15 pesos to 640 pesos.
TAIWAN gave up small early gains to close 1.7 per cent lower, undermined by
a late plunge in shares of Formosa group firms in the wake of 1993 results
from Formosa Plastics and Nan Ya on Wednesday.
The weighted index closed 98.48 down at 5,670.71, off a low of 5,647, in

disappointment about recent corporate results and the All Ordinaries closed
21.9 down at 2,197.0.
NEW ZEALAND held firm, the NZSE-40 capital index hovering around its opening
level throughout the day before some late buying tipped it 4.03 higher to
finish at 2,269.26.
Fletcher Challenge rose 7 cents to NZDollars 3.33 following its half year
profit announcement on Wednesday.
BANGKOK lost momentum on a lack of positive news coupled with fears of an
upward trend in US interest rates. The SET index fell 11.11 to 1,419.54 in
thin turnover of Bt6.8bn.
BOMBAY saw demand from investors under the mistaken impression that
passenger fares and freight rates had been only marginally raised in the

FT  25 FEB 94 / Markets Report: France trims rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday trimmed its intervention rate by 10 basis
points to 6.10 per cent, confirming the likely downward trend of official
European interest rates, writes Philip Gawith.
The rate-cut, which surprised observers, was in stark contrast to the
interest rate pessimism in European bond and futures markets. By late
afternoon the December short sterling and D-Mark interest rate futures on
LIFFE had fallen by 20 and 22 points respectively, indicating the market
view that interest rates are likely to rise over the remainder of the year.
Currency markets initially remained immune from this volatility, but the
dollar weakened sharply in the afternoon on speculation of heavy hedge fund
selling.
The French franc remained firm after yesterday's cut in rates. It closed in
London at FFr3.397 to the D-Mark from FFr3.398 on Wednesday. The cut in the
intervention rate - the key instrument used by the BOF to influence monetary
policy - was the first move in monetary policy by the BOF's monetary council
since its formation last month. The timing surprised most observers who had
expected the BOF to wait for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate before
acting.
As with last week's cut in the German discount rate, the BOF appeared more
concerned to send a signal to the market about the future direction of
rates, than to effect any significant easing in policy. Ms Phyllis Reed,
European bond strategist at BZW, commented: 'The BOF was probably quite
market sensitive. It wanted to reassure the market that its lack of action
after last week's Bundesbank easing did not mean they wouldn't move at all.'
The BOF also appears to have struck a balance between the conflicting
imperatives of wanting to show its independence and tracking the D-Mark - a
key component of its monetary policy. The French intervention rate remains
10 basis points above the German repo rate of 6 per cent and some
commentators stressed that this shows the BOF's intention not to put
pressure on the franc by pushing French rates below German rates.
The dollar finished slightly stronger against the D-Mark, closing in London
at DM1.7306 from DM1.7279 on Wednesday. It later fell sharply in New York
against both the yen and the dollar and was trading yesterday evening at
Y105 and DM1.7150. It closed a third of a cent weaker at Dollars 1.4796
against sterling and was slightly down compared to the yen, finishing at
Y105.350 from Y105.525 on Wednesday.
Earlier in the day there had been a flurry of activity after the release of
US durable goods orders. The headline figure of a 3.7 per cent increase in
January durable goods orders, compared to a market forecast of 0.8 per cent,
initially fuelled talk of another possible US monetary tightening.
Later, however, this figure was largely discounted when it was discovered
that the figures were heavily influenced by airline orders. Stripped of the
transport factor, the rise was only 0.3 per cent.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, noted that it was the sixth
consecutive rise in a volatile series and hence could be considered a
'fairly strong number'. The fact that unfilled orders had also risen was
another bullish piece of data. Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at
Citibank, said he didn't believe the figures gave any cause for concern
about the strength of the US recovery and he forecast 2.5-3 per cent growth
for the US economy this year.
Traders said the weaker dollar was apparently the product of heavy dollar
sales by the hedge funds which took the opportunity to sell heavily into
dollar strength when the US currency rose initially after the release of the
durable goods figures.
With hedge funds apparently having suffered heavy losses recently on the yen
and in bond markets, analysts speculated that they were taking profits
wherever they could be found. Others said weakness in the US stock and bond
markets had fuelled sale of dollars.
In theory the fears of higher US interest rates, which have unnerved leading
equity and bond markets, should be dollar positive.
The D-Mark finished weaker in Europe yesterday on fears of industrial unrest
in the engineering sector, concerns about another possible easing of policy
and worries about political instability in Russia. Sentiment was initially
undermined by reports that the Russian parliament had voted to offer amnesty
to some of President Yeltsin's opponents. Rumours about a possible coup in
Russia also hit the D-Mark.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 330m of late assistance to UK money
markets bringing total help for day to Pounds 2.345bn, compared to a revised
liquidity shortage of Pounds 2.4bn.
The large shortage is evidence that the Bank of England's recently
introduced twice-monthly repo facility - introduced to supplement its daily
money market operations - has yet to bed down properly. The aim of the new
facility is to reduce the daily shortage so that the Bank can more easily
influence money market rates.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Newmont claims that its gold
'bug' process is viable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newmont Gold, the biggest US gold producer, yesterday claimed that its
patented process for recovering gold from very low grade refractory (or
difficult) ore by using bacteria was commercially viable.
The company has been employing thiobacillus ferro-oxidans,
naturally-occuring 'bugs', to do in months what would otherwise take
millions of years. Gencor of South Africa uses similar bacteria for its gold
bio-leaching process, increasingly employed world-wide, but Newmont's is
different in that ore is piled in a huge heap rather than treated by liquid
in tanks.
Newmont has already stockpiled at its mines on the Carlin Trend in Nevada
material that would be waste if bio-leaching did not work. Mr Peter Philip,
president, said that it was now likely Newmont would be able to count the
gold in the material towards its reserves by the end of the year: 1.1m
ounces of it.
Costs would depend each specific project but Mr Philip said that they would
be roughly Dollars 3.50 a tonne treated.
His company was in talks with American Barrick, its neighbour on the Carlin
Trend, which has about 20m tonnes of low grade, refractory material
containing 1m ounces of gold. If it proves commercially viable to use
Newmont's bio-leaching process on the Barrick material, the partners would
share the capital costs and the profits.
Mr Philip said Newmont had identified other mines around the world where
bio-leaching might be able to turn waste into ore and was looking for more
joint ventures similar to the one contemplated with Barrick.
He said treatment of the Barrick material could begin on a commercial basis
as early as next year. Newmont would not need to treat its own material
until 1996.
Mr Philip hoped that before then Newmont's new process would have been
superseded by a second process that could release gold from low-grade,
refractory ore that also contains carbon - a material to which gold
naturally sticks, so no matter how well the bacteria do their job, the
precious metal is still not released. Newmont's land in Nevada has great
deal of this type of material containing an estimated 2.9m ounces of gold.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco trader denies
destroying documents relating to Dollars 206m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The man at the centre of the futures scandal at Codelco, Chile's state-owned
copper company, has denied accusations that he destroyed documents relating
to the loss of Dollars 206m on metals futures operations.
'Not a single document was destroyed that had any bearing on the
investigation,' Mr Juan Pablo Davila told journalists after eight hours of
testimony before the parliamentary commission looking into the case.
Mr Davila, former chief futures trader at Codelco, has been accused by the
company's acting president, Mr Jorge Rodriguez, of destroying correspondence
from brokers. 'If we had had these documents, we could have cleared up this
case much more quickly,' Mr Rodriguez said.
Mr Davila's statement came after President Patricio Aylwin had on Wednesday
received an interim report into the futures losses prepared by the
comptroller general.
Details of the report are not known, but a spokesman for the comptroller
said losses were found to be 'somewhat higher' than the Dollars 206m cited
by Codelco executives. They could rise or fall depending on the handling of
contracts that were still open, he said.
The report is also believed to point to a lack of controls over futures
operations and to assign part responsibility for such failings to executives
outside the futures department. Mr Rodriguez said that failure to implement
controls - either deliberately or through negligence - was 'very serious'.
Meanwhile, Codelco executives moved to limit the damage over the delay in
signing a joint venture agreement for the El Abra project, which had been
expected to raise an initial Dollars 555m. New tests on the deposit
requested by the Cyprus Amax/Lac Minerals consortium, which last year agreed
to take a 51 per cent stake in El Abra, would be ready by the end of April,
Codelco said.

The three months COPPER price ran up to Dollars 1,900 a tonne level by the
end of after hours trading at the London Metal Exchange, a Dollars 20 gain
from Wednesday, helped by aluminium's strength and solid support below
Dollars 1,880 a tonne earlier in the session.
At the London bullion market GOLD closed at 35 cents down at Dollars 378.10
a troy ounce after the New York market had weathered a test by bank selling.
PLATINUM was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 389.50 an ounce, down Dollars
2.50 on the day and Dollars 9.50 on the week so far, as perception of the
need to cover against possible South African mine disruptions in the lead-up
to the April elections subsided.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pechiney's cut lifts aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pechiney, Europe's biggest aluminium producer, yesterday joined the
international groups pledging to cut world-wide annual output to bring the
market back into better balance. The French group will cut output by 12 per
cent or 120,000 tonnes for at least 18 months, starting in April - a move
that will include the long-expected permanent closure of its smelter at
Venthon in France.
Pechiney previously indicated that it would contribute to the global
reduction in output but its cuts are bigger than the market expected. The
three-month aluminium price, which had been languishing at Dollars 1,290 a
tonne on the London Metal Exchange before Pechiney's news, revived to close
at Dollars ,314.50, up Dollars 12. But it remained well below the recent
18-month peak of Dollars 1,331 a tonne.
Cuts announced so far by western producers total roughly 830,000 tonnes for
a full year, according to Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. This would
have little impact during the first half of 1994, he suggested, but would
reduce western production from 14.977m tonnes last year to about 14.3m in
1994.
Mr MacMillan remained sceptical about the ability of the Russian government
to persuade the republic's smelters to make all the cuts promised by trade
delegates at a meeting last month in Brussels: 200,000 tonnes by April and
then another 300,000 in the next three months.
He said there was unlikely to be any substantial boost to aluminium demand
before 1995. But then it could be very strong and stocks, now standing at
record levels, might start to fall quickly - if aluminium smelting capacity
remained shut.
The Russian industry welcomed Pechiney's announcement and suggested that it
would enable talks between some major aluminium-producing nations in Canada
next week to make substantial progress. The meeting in Ottawa will assess
progress made since delegates in Brussels agreed that producers should push
ahead with global output cuts of at least 1.5m tonnes or about 10 per cent
of world production.
The Russians previously have been critical of Pechiney's vacillation
because, like many others in the industry, they believe the French group was
mainly responsible for persuading the European Commission to impose
restrictions on aluminium imports from the former Soviet Union to European
Union countries.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The official Australian market indicator fell another 7 cents this week, to
516c/kg, but this still leaves it only 30 cents below its peak early in
February. Wool prices continue to present an erratic appearance. Finer
Merinos this week were irregularly lower, with considerable variations
between the main auction centres in Australia for normally comparable types.
Crossbreds and some border Merinos have not eased much, if at all, during
the present market downturn. New Zealand was dearer, and in South Africa
offerings are tailing off early in the closing stages of the selling season.
Trading activity in the industry beyond the wool market itself is subdued,
and prices are very competitive. The recovery from recession remains very
mixed according to market sector and the country involved.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: French prepare to meet
challenge of post-Gatt farming - David Buchan on the structural
inefficiencies that must be addressed to improve competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French agriculture must become 'the most competitive in Europe', says Mr
Jean Puech, France's farm minister.
Such an ambition may seem redundant for a country that is already the
world's second largest exporter of farm products. But it is partly designed
to lift French farmers out of any post-Gatt depression and offer them a new
horizon.
In fact, French farmers are already showing a positive response to the new
world in European agriculture. 'Our farmers seem to have been greatly
relieved to find that within the last few weeks of 1993 their income support
cheques starting arriving from Brussels, showing that the reform of the
common agricultural policy actually works, and that the eventual Gatt
agreement was not nearly as bad as they originally feared,' says a senior
agriculture ministry official in Paris. French banks report that in the
first few weeks of this year farmers were starting to invest in fertiliser,
tractors and new buildings, reversing their cutbacks of 1992-93.
Mr Puech's statement is, however, also a recognition that while France may
lead Europe in sectors like cereals and sugar, and has made great strides in
pork and poultry, its competitiveness is variable in milk production and
often downright bad in beef and sheepmeat.
'Up to now France has been more interested in markets and prices, rather
than costs and charges,' explains a senior aide to Mr Puech. 'With the
common agricultural policy and Gatt decisions on markets and prices, we are
for the first time taking a serious look at how to reduce our costs and
charges.'
Among the structural inefficiencies in French farming pinpointed by both the
ministry and the main farming union, the FNSEA, are:
A fiscal system that taxes farm sales as well as farm incomes, and a land
tax that bears disproportionately on farmers raising relatively small
numbers of cattle or sheep on relatively large tracts of poor land.
There is also a persistent social security problem. Most of the government's
special FFr3bn (Pounds 345m) aid last year was to help older farmers, or
their widows, to catch up on their social security insurance arrears. 'We
still need several billion more francs here,' says the FNSEA.
Over-lavish services and infrastructure offered by co-operatives that are no
longer appropriate for their members in the new, leaner era.
Grain co-operatives tended to dot the landscape with mini-silos, while the
evidence is that many farmers would now prefer to make the longer haul with
their harvest to a central silo if that would give them a better price or
more efficient and rapid marketing. Likewise in livestock, farmers have
relied on co-operatives to take their animals to market for them, while now
many would prefer to save on this and take their animals directly to
auction.
The absence of a corporate structure to most farms. This is most sharply
felt when it comes to inheritance - French law requires that all estates be
equally divided among children.
The upshot is that a new farmer has to buy out the stakes of his siblings,
amounting to a heavy tax at the start of his career. A corporate system
would allow the non-farming members of a family to retain their shares,
which could in turn be used as collateral to buy a house or whatever
elsewhere.
Legal and tax problems for farmers in working part-time outside agriculture.
The French 'fisc' does not tax favourably income from such outside
activities, while the state accident insurance system gives farmers no cover
outside their main business. In addition, there is more scope for local
authorities in mountain and tourist areas to employ farmers to clear ski and
hiking trails.
Any remedies, financial or legal, for these structural inefficiencies are
clearly within France's national prerogative in the framework of the CAP.
Any fears that France might be about to exploit the current trend towards
subsidiarity in the European Union, 'renationalise' parts of the CAP and
give French farmers an unfair advantage over their EU partners, are
unfounded, French officials insist.
But the dividing line between fair and unfair aid, in the EU context, is not
always clear. A case in point is the more than FFr300m aid that Paris gave
its pig farmers, chiefly in Brittany, to help them cope with a crash in
prices and a 47 per cent drop in their incomes last year. This aid was to
restructure the pig producers' past debt. But, partly in response to British
pig farmers' complaints, Mr Rene Steichen, the EU farm commissioner has
expressed concern that it might encourage further future investment by the
Breton pig producers.
In fact, Paris may have other reasons to rein in this sector's rapid
expansion. Brittany, with its proximity to ports and cheap imported grain,
now produces more than half France's pork. Not only is there in areas such
as that around Lamballe, known now as 'Pig Valley', a serious risk of
environmental and disease contamination, but the success of the Breton pig
producers in supplying the charcuterie industry in the Midi and the Pyrenees
regions brought pig farmers from those regions up to Brittany last month to
protest at the 'dumping' methods of their Breton counterparts.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Another sharp sell-off staged in hectic
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN, GILLIAN TETT and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds staged another sharp sell-off in hectic trading as
traders reported panic selling, mainly in the futures markets.
UK gilts took the worst beating, falling by as much as three points in the
afternoon, while most European markets slid by between one and two points at
the long end.
'This sell-off is completely unwarranted on fundamental grounds,' said Mr
George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'What we're
dealing with has very little to do with economic fundamentals - it's about
the preservation of capital.'
Bond markets worldwide have been weakening for the last few weeks in a
sell-off that began after the US Federal Reserve's small monetary tightening
in early February.
Gilts bore the brunt of the selling and under-performed most continental
European bond markets. The March long gilt futures contract dropped by 2
23/32 points to 111 13/16 and the yield spread on the 10-year benchmark gilt
over its German counterpart widened to 113 basis points, from 88 basis
points on Wednesday.
An overnight slide in US Treasuries and a bearish UK interest-rate forecast
from Nomura equities strategist, Mr Nick Knight, sent gilts sharply lower at
the open. Mr Knight said he expects UK base rates to rise to between 6 and 7
per cent by the year-end from 5.25 per cent now.
Traders reported some switching into gilts out of French and German
government bonds, but said that was more than offset by continued sales from
leveraged trading accounts in the US.
Buying is unlikely to emerge before the sell-off has run its course.
'There's too much speculative money about and buyers are on strike,' said Mr
Bob Tyley, senior strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.
He recommends taking a reactive stance. 'Don't try to pick the bottom - keep
out and wait for things to calm down before re-entering these markets.'
German government bonds also fell sharply, with traders citing nervousness
over potential turmoil in Russia and fears of inflated money supply data for
January. In late London trading the March Bund future was down 1.31 point at
96.65.
French bonds fell steeply after the Bank of France cut its intervention rate
by 10 basis points to 6.10 per cent.
Dealers were disappointed by the size of the cut. Many had expected the
central bank to leave rates steady until the Bundesbank's next easing, while
others had bet on a 20 basis point cut in a move asserting the Bank of
France's new independence.
The March French bond future dropped by 1.04 points to 126.94.
Belgium plans to launch a 30-year bond by the summer, finance minister Mr
Philippe Maystadt said yesterday.
The government also plans to issue a new nine-year bond, known as the
'3-6-9', targeted primarily at domestic and retail investors.
The bond will be issued between March 8 and 14, and will carry a fixed
coupon of 6 per cent between 1994 and 1995. The rate will then be variable,
with a minimum level of 6.25 per cent between 1997 and 2000, and then 6.5
per cent for the last three years.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds attempted to rally yesterday afternoon after
a successful five-year note auction, but the brief upturn fizzled amid
persisent concerns over monetary policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 3/32 lower
at 93 3/4 , with the yield rising to 6.735 per cent. It was the first time
since July that the long bond's rate of return has exceeded 6.7 per cent. At
the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 4.724
per cent.
The session's direction was established at the opening. Bonds fell on news
of a 3.7 per cent rise in January durable goods orders, against forecasts of
a 1 per cent increase. But traders soon realised that most of the jump was
attributable to a sharp upturn in aircraft orders, and the market retraced
some of its losses.
Nevertheless, traders were approaching the afternoon sale of Dollars 11bn in
five-year notes with caution, causing prices to fall again mid-morning.
Early on, there seemed to be little enthusiasm for buying the new issue,
with the widespread view that the Federal Reserve would soon raise
short-term rates for a second time.
In the event, the auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year paper drew more
demand than expected, and follow-through buying briefly revived the market.
But the underlying anxiety over interest rates resurfaced, and sentiment
soon shifted once again. In late activity, prices were near the lowest
levels of the session.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Gilt market sees future in
greater transparency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange will next week announce plans to improve the quality of
information provided in the UK government bond market, in an attempt to
increase the transparency of the gilt market.
Since the reorganisation of the gilt market at the time of Big Bang in 1986,
the question of transparency has barely been addressed. The current system
is by no means perfect. Private client stockbrokers are damning about the
lack of live price information, compared with what is available in equity
markets.
Gilt-edged market-makers, known as Gemms, are not obliged to quote their
bid-offer prices on a screen for all to see, nor do they have to publish the
price at which the last trade was conducted.
By contrast, market-makers in equities publish their bid-offer spreads on
Seaq International and the best prices available are shown on the so-called
'yellow strip' (the space at the top of the page devoted to a particular
stock). They also publish the last trade.
Stockbrokers complain that information available in the gilt market is
inadequate, particularly for retail investors.
The dealers or Gemms themselves have access to inter-dealer broker screens,
where they can see the price quoted by other dealers, who remain anonymous.
Market-makers prefer anonymity to having their names beside the quotes: they
dislike the idea of competitors being able to see what prices they are
quoting as it can lead to manipulation in the market.
Some participants believe that complete pre-trade transparency would lead to
a widening of the bid-offer spread.
Stockbrokers, however, do not have access to the inter-dealer broker
service. There are certain 'closed-user groups'. For example, on the Stock
Exchange's Topic screen, Greenwell Montagu, SG Warburg, UBS and Goldman
Sachs have closed-user pages, showing their particular prices, although in
certain cases users complain that the prices are not updated very
frequently, which can pose a problem when the market is volatile.
In addition, the Stock Exchange Topic screen shows the 'mid-price' (the
price halfway between bid and offer prices) of gilts. The service is
compiled from a representative sample of Gemms and is updated at least every
hour and sometimes more often.
The Bank of England and the Stock Exchange set up a Retail Gilts Working
Party at the end of 1992 to look at dealing and settlement in the gilt
market.
The results are due to be announced next week and the Stock Exchange said it
will make recommendations on improving the quality of its mid-price service.
Some experts think it needs updating more regularly and would like to see
greater post-trade transparency - at least for retail trades - with the
publication on screen of the last deal.
In that way, the mid-price service would give a sense of what market-makers
are quoting and the 'last-deal' service would give a sense of what had
actually been done.
However, some stockbrokers would prefer to see even greater transparency,
with Gemms forced to quote their bid-offer spreads on one single screen for
all to see.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Widening yield spreads prompt intense
debate on launch timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chronic weakness in government bond markets and the recent widening of
yield spreads in the Eurobond market have sparked intense discussions
between issuers and their advisers on whether they should accelerate their
international borrowing programmes.
An official at the World Bank said he was taking soundings from the market
on the possible timing and pricing for a proposed global bond offering of
Dollars 1.25bn. The 10-year issue would almost complete the dollar portion
of the World Bank's annual borrowing programme of Dollars 10bn to Dollars
12bn which is due to end on June 30.
The official said current indications were for a tighter pricing than the
level achieved on the World Bank's last global bond offering.
When the bonds were launched last September, they were priced to yield 10
basis points over US Treasuries but they now yield 10 basis points below
Treasuries.
He added, however, that the World Bank's style was to find fair market value
and it would rather withhold from launching an issue than press for a
certain level. A decision was likely to be taken by the end of next week, he
said.
Meanwhile, a further heavy fall in the US Treasury market prompted the
National Bank of Hungary to delay the launch of its first global bond
offering until market conditions improved. The market had expected the
Dollars 500m, 10-year issue to be launched yesterday. An official at lead
manager Salomon Brothers said Hungary's decision reflected its reluctance to
pay a higher coupon, especially since it was under no pressure to borrow.
'Hungary is not in need of money, the purpose of the deal is to establish a
benchmark,' the official said.
Market jitters did not deter investment banks from underwriting just over
Dollars 2bn worth of floating-rate notes, which included the first
lira-denominated offering by a US investment bank.
The largest single FRN offering came from BankAmerica which raised Dollars
750m through a five-year issue. Some syndicate managers said the notes,
which had a discounted margin of 21 basis points over Libor, appeared
expensive compared with recent bank FRNs.
Lead manager Kidder Peabody said pricing reflected BankAmerica's improved
standing with investors. 'American banks are enjoying a renaissance in their
credit appraisal,' it said, noting that commercial banks tended to achieve
lower spreads than investment banks.
The maturity of one year and two days on Republic of Argentina's Dollars
350m offering of FRNs prompted one syndicate manager to describe it as
'glorified commercial paper'.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the issuer had chosen the maturity in the
belief that its yield spread would continue to improve at a rapid pace. The
margin at launch was 100 basis points over Libor.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Showa Shell plunges on forex
losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Emiko Terazono in Tokyo
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refiner and distributor affiliated with
Royal Dutch Shell, reported a 54.2 per cent fall in after-tax profits for
the year to last December after writing off its losses on foreign exchange
futures trading.
The company lost Y115.3bn (Dollars 1.09bn) from Dollars 4.6bn worth of
dollar futures contracts, part of which was used to pay for crude oil and
other imports. After-tax profits totalled Y9bn as Showa Shell posted
extraordinary losses of Y80.1bn, part of which it covered with extraordinary
gains of Y65bn from stock and land sales.
In spite of the profit fall, the company will maintain its annual dividend
of Y8 per share. Pre-tax profits fell 3.6 per cent to Y36.6bn due to a rise
in distribution costs. Sales fell 7.5 per cent to Y1,447.7bn, but operating
profits rose 24.5 per cent to Y61.4bn thanks to strong sales of its
high-margin petrol and a change in accounting methods for depreciation
costs.
For the current year to December, Showa Shell expects to write off Y43bn out
of the remaining unrealised losses on its dollar futures holdings. The
company is projecting a 6.7 per cent fall in sales to Y1,350bn and a 23.6
per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to Y28bn. After-tax profits are expected
to rise 43.9 per cent to Y13bn.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Setback for Hollinger earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hollinger, the international newspaper holding company controlled by Mr
Conrad Black, suffered a two-thirds fall in earnings last year, despite an 8
per cent rise in the contribution from its flagship, the UK-based Telegraph
group.
The drop was largely due to higher interest expenses and unusual items,
mostly related to Hollinger's acquisition of a 9.3 per cent interest in
Southam, Canada's biggest daily newspaper chain. The Telegraph also has a
9.3 per cent stake in Southam.
Hollinger's operating earnings were virtually unchanged before taking the
unusual items and the cost of the Southam investment into account. Net
earnings dipped to CDollars 25.3m (USDollars 18.80m), or 31 cents a share,
from CDollars 74m, or CDollars 1.14, in 1992.
Revenues advanced to CDollars 888m from CDollars 870m. Although the 68 per
cent-owned Telegraph reported an 18 per cent rise in operating earnings, the
impact on Hollinger's income was dampened by the weaker pound against the
Canadian dollar.
Operating results improved in all businesses except for Canadian
publications. Hollinger recently announced plans to spin off part of its
wholly-owned Canadian and US subsidiaries to the public.
The net cost of the Southam investment is estimated at CDollars 6.5m in 1994
(assuming constant interest rates and an unchanged dividend), down from
CDollars 18.2m last year.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: TNT bounces back with ADollars
25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transportation group which saw boardroom upheavals last
year and has been pruning its activities in an effort to reduce heavy
borrowings, yesterday reported a net operating profit before abnormal items
of ADollars 25.5m (USDollars 18.3m) in the six months to end-1993. The
equity-consolidated figure compares with a loss of ADollars 9.81m in the
same period of 1992.
After abnormal items, the net equity-accounted profit stood at ADollars
22.3m, a sharp improvement on last time's ADollars 74.5m loss. Revenues were
ADollars 2.85bn, compared with ADollars 2.8bn.
TNT said that the return to profit was largely due to better trading results
from Ansett, the Australian airline which it owns jointly with Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation, and to the general restructuring of the group's
business, which has involved a significant disposal programme.
It pointed out that TNT benefited from some non-recurring items in the first
half of 1992, due to the involvement of its event merchandising arm in Expo
'92 and the 1992 Olympic Games, and the underlying improvement in the most
recent six months was more marked still.
Despite the overall advance, the group's core transportation operations
still had a mixed first half. The Australian business showed a 'significant'
improvement, and the Canadian business continued to turn round. The domestic
freight business in the UK was also strong, while TNT Germany improved
profits.
But other parts of continental Europe were more difficult. The Spanish
operations 'performed below expectations in a severely depressed economy'.
In Italy, TNT Traco reported profits 'marginally lower' than in the previous
period, while in France the TNT Chronoservice business remained in the red,
although losses were reduced.
TNT's share of net profits before abnormal items from Ansett Transport
Industries rose handsomely, to ADollars 38.5m from ADollars 8.79m. But its
50 per cent interest in GD Express Worldwide, the international express
delivery operation, delivered a loss of ADollars 24.6m against a loss of
ADollars 22.8m last time. TNT said that GDEW's operating loss was expected,
and that the target of profits by 1995 was still on course.
Interest expenses in the first half fell to ADollars 41.3m from ADollars
46.8m, and the company estimated that its net debt to equity ratio had
improved from 2.18 at end-June to 1.08 at end-December. Looking ahead, it
added that the improvement in operating performance was expected to
continue, but that second-half results would be affected by seasonal
factors, especially in the third quarter.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Nine Network buys films stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network Australia, which has a 14.97 per cent stake
in John Fairfax, is buying a minority interest in Regency Enterprises, the
Hollywood film production and distribution company which produced and
financed films such as JFK and Sommersby and which has ties with Time
Warner.
The Australian TV and radio company is buying out the interests in Regency
which are currently held by an existing minority investor, Dr Bodo Scriba,
but will also subscribe some additional capital to help fund Regency's
expansion plans.
The total cost of Nine's investment is expected to be around ADollars 165m
(USDollars 118.70m), although the money will be committed in two tranches.
The final details of the transaction have yet to be negotiated and the deal
is due to be completed within two months.
Nine Network is likely to end up with around 30 per cent of Regency. The
remainder will be held by Mr Arnon Milchan, who founded Regency in 1991,
when a long-term financing and distribution arrangement with Time Warner,
the entertainment group, was set up.
Yesterday, in Sydney, Mr Bruce Gyngell, Nine Network chairman, said that
there should be 'strategic' benefits' from the investment, and that it would
have 'the added attraction of bringing us even closer to Time Warner'.
Last year, Nine signed a new three-year programming contract with Time
Warner.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Renison puts blame for tumble
into red on weak prices and demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renison Goldfields, the Australian mining company which is 40 per cent-owned
by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday reported a net loss of ADollars 15.3m
(USDollars 11m) in the six months to end-December, down from a ADollars
10.4m profit in the corresponding period of 1992-3. Operating revenues were
ADollars 276.4m, compared with ADollars 330.9m a year earlier.
The move into the red was blamed on weak prices and demand. Renison said
that tin prices were more than 20 per cent lower than a year ago while
copper was down by 15 per cent, and that prices for titanium dioxide
feedstock products were also depressed.
The effect of these significantly lower prices was partially offset by
strengthening zircon and gold prices, and the Namara open-cast coal mine
made a ADollars 6m profits contribution, meeting its contracted sales since
the mine started up. But, although there were no abnormals charges in either
first-half period, the latest results do include ADollars 3.8m of
restructuring costs, related to both the exploration division, which was
overhauled during the first half, and the head office.
Renison said yesterday that the changes to the exploration side would mean
more effort being expended on exploring for gold, base metals and mineral
sands in specific regions of Australia. Offshore activities would
'concentrate on the identification of advanced exploration targets'. Its
Canberra exploration office is being closed and the division will be managed
from Perth.
Both the mineral sands and the tin interests were loss-making in the first
half as was the Mount Lyell copper mine. On the gold front, the group's
interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea - which was reduced
from 30 per cent to 25 per cent at end-February 1993 - contributed ADollars
35.7m, compared with ADollars 40m last time.
Mr Tony Cotton, the Hanson director who was appointed deputy chairman of
Renison in October, will become chairman of the company on March 1. He takes
over from Mr Max Roberts, who is retiring.

lifts Fairfax 50%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black, the
Canadian media proprietor, holds a minority interest, yesterday announced a
50.2 per cent improvement in first-half profits after tax but before
abnormals, at ADollars 54.2m (USDollars 38.9m).
The advance at the pre-interest operating level was slightly more modest - a
15.2 per cent rise to ADollars 101.8m. This, said Fairfax, reflected
'improving economic conditions and reduced costs'. Operating revenues were
up by 7.2 per cent as a result of increased advertising rates and volumes,
and increases in some cover prices.
Overall, Fairfax - which takes in the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne)
Age and The Australian Financial Review - saw advertising revenue increase
by about 6 per cent and circulation revenue by some 10 per cent. Operating
costs for the half-year were up by 4.7 per cent due to promotional
initiatives and the increased activity.
The company said that circulation figures for the Saturday editions of The
Age and Herald were strong and that AFR circulation had also increased. But
it acknowledged that weekday circulations of The Age and Herald had fallen.
Fairfax's net profits total was helped by a significant fall in interest
charges - down from ADollars 27.1m in the first half of 1992-93 to ADollars
19.6m in the most recent period. The company also enjoyed a ADollars 28m
abnormal income tax benefit, bringing bottom-line profits to ADollars 82.1m,
compared with ADollars 36m last time.
An Australian senate inquiry looking into foreign ownership in the print
media is being extended to give the committee time to question Mr Black. The
committee is examining reasons behind the Labor government's decision to
allow Mr Black's Tourang consortium to lift its interest in Fairfax from 15
to 25 per cent.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pasminco registers ADollars 11m
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, yesterday unveiled a loss
of ADollars 11.2m (USDollars 8m), after tax but before abnormal items, in
the six months to end-December. In the same period of the previous year,
there was a ADollars 4.7m loss.
Abnormal charges amounted to a further ADollars 8.7m, and reflected
redundancy costs of ADollars 6.3m, plus a ADollars 2.4m loss on the sale of
certain UK assets to MIM Holdings. This left the group's bottom-line loss at
ADollars 19.9m, compared with ADollars 6m a year earlier. Total revenue fell
from ADollars 789m to ADollars 614.5m.
Pasminco said that the low level of metal prices, due to world oversupply,
had caused the loss but also noted that 'continued improvements in
productivity and efficiency generated cost savings of ADollars 42m pre-tax'.
Under the circumstances, it suggested that the loss this time compared
favourably with the previous year's half-time result.
Pasminco says it hopes to improve on last time's full-year result, which
showed a net loss before abnormals of ADollars 43.2m.
The half-year figures benefited from a reduction in the group's interest
charges - down from ADollars 14.4m to ADollars 10.9m, with borrowings
declining by ADollars 170m to ADollars 351m, due to the sale of the UK
assets and a share placement which raised ADollars 88m.

Siam Cement, the Thai construction materials company and the country's
biggest conglomerate, reported a 20 per cent fall in consolidated net
profits for 1993 to Bt3.16bn (Dollars 124m), from Bt3.98bn a year earlier.
Strong end-of-year demand for cement helped fourth-quarter profits climb 64
per cent to Bt584m.
Analysts said the drop in earnings should not obscure the company's general
health which is buoyed by continued heavy domestic demand for cement.
The company's aggressive depreciation policy ensures that capital
expenditure hits short-term profits; plant with a life of 30 years is
typically depreciated within five years.
Mr George Morgan, head of research at brokers HG Asia in Bangkok, said he
was expecting consolidated net profits of Bt4.10bn in 1994.
Subsidiaries Siam Guardian Glass and Siam Construction Steel continue to
lose money.
Thailand's number two cement producer Siam City Cement announced a 30 per
cent rise in net profits for its parent company to Bt1.47bn from Bt1.13bn
following a 56 per cent fall in fourth-quarter net profits.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sealink behind surge at Stena
Line

Stena Line, the world's largest ferry operator, yesterday unveiled a SKr273m
(Dollars 37.1m) profit after financial items for 1993, up 66 per cent from
the year-earlier level.
It also announced plans to raise up to SKr930m through share and convertible
issues to fund orders for two high-speed ferries. The vessels may be
deployed in UK waters, including the Dover-Calais route where they would
compete with the Channel Tunnel.
The group attributed its improved result to a strong performance from its UK
operation, Stena Sealink, and lower financial costs.
These helped to offset lower profits from its Scandinavian operations which
were hit by recession, the weak krona and higher household savings levels.
Stena Sealink benefited from higher volumes and cost-cutting and accounted
for about half of group profit, said Mr Bo Lerenius, Stena Line chief
executive.
The UK unit has staged a big recovery since 1991 when its losses dragged
Stena Line deep into the red.
The group expects a further improvement in profits this year due to another
good performance in the UK and the benefits of cost-cutting. It acknowledges
the Channel Tunnel will have an impact on performance but is less worried
about the prospect of a price war since Eurotunnel published its fares
structure last month.
Turnover rose 13 per cent to SKr9.0bn, due to currency factors and volume
growth. Passenger numbers were 2 per cent higher at 14.3m while freight
units rose 7 per cent to 840,000.
A SKr1 per share dividend is proposed, the company's first pay-out since
1990.
The company hopes to place orders for two 40-knot catamarans, which can
carry 1,500 passengers each, before June.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hedge funds lick forex wounds -
Patrick Harverson and Sara Webb on a sudden change in fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US hedge and futures funds have made losses of up to 25 per cent so far this
month following the recent turbulence in the world's financial markets.
Tass Management, which tracks over 600 funds, mainly in the US, said the
losses were primarily due to the unexpected moves in the yen/dollar exchange
rate in the middle of the month and the fall in European government bond
markets.
Hedge funds are private investment pools which borrow huge sums of money to
trade securities and currencies in financial markets. They are often managed
very aggressively and can be highly geared. In the UK government bond
market, the larger hedge funds typically trade as much as 10,000 futures
contracts, equivalent to Pounds 500m nominal.
Some of the largest and best known funds are managed by investment gurus
such as Mr George Soros, Mr Michael Steinhardt and Mr Julian Robertson, and
in recent years have built up an impressive record of above-average returns
for investors.
Mr Soros's Quantum Fund was said by one industry source to have lost up to
14 per cent of its value on February 14 as a result of the yen/dollar
exchange rate move. Mr Stanley Druckenmiller, the fund manager, was quoted
earlier this week saying the fund management group lost about Dollars 600m
that day.
In the last week, European government bonds have seen sharp falls, driven by
activity in the futures markets, with traders reporting a tidal wave of
selling by US hedge funds.
Rumours circulated that some hedge funds had stopped trading temporarily as
they exceeded permitted losses. One hedge fund manager said he had received
a bank telex warning that up to 18 hedge funds had stopped operating, but
added that these were small funds rather than household names.
'They're like mushrooms, they're always springing up all over the place, so
it wouldn't be surprising if some of them did stop trading,' said a gilt
trader at a US house.
The problems of the past few weeks contrast markedly with last year when the
average gross return for US hedge funds was 27.26 per cent, according to
Miss Lee Hennessee, of Hedge Fund Select, which is part of Republic New York
Securities and tracks over 800 funds.
The biggest 'macro' funds, those designed to profit from changes in global
economics, particularly changes based on major interest rate moves, fared
even better, showing a gross return of 53 per cent last year.
This year, however, the big hedge funds have been caught out by the rise in
the Japanese yen against the dollar and the drop in European bond prices.
Many of the big funds had built up sizeable long positions in Europe,
especially in high-yielding bonds from countries such as Sweden, Spain, and
Italy, as well as in the UK government bond market.
At the same time, some funds, notably Quantum, had shorted the yen against
the dollar in anticipation of a gradual strengthening in the US currency
against a yen undermined by the weak Japanese economy.
The hedge funds' reversal of fortune could well force them to adopt a more
cautious strategy in the markets in future, with traders expecting the funds
to invest smaller amounts, at least until some of the losses have been
regained, and to refocus on risk control.
'Hedge funds should be hedged to reduce the downside risk: the problem is
that a lot of them aren't,' says one hedge fund manager who claims to have
reduced his losses to 1 per cent in February by hedging.
'Now investors are saying they don't want to be highly geared, and they are
happy with an upside of between 15 and 20 per cent instead.'
'Investors in hedge funds will have to start learning that these returns of
70 per cent and 100 per cent are gone for the foreseeable future,' said one
US hedge fund trader. 'The massive macro opportunities are not there
anymore. The hedge fund industry has become a crowded field and a lot of
people are chasing the same ideas.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Milan SE expects sharp growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Milan stock exchange expects sharp growth in the next four years, with
an additional 100 company listings and a 50 per cent surge in market value,
according to Mr Attilio Ventura, chairman of the stock exchange council.
The forecast comes during a buoyant period for the market, which has seen
daily turnover this year regularly exceed L1,000bn (Dollars 595m), a level
virtually unknown a few months ago.
The upbeat prediction follows legislative changes, modernising and
simplifying trading, and the international fall in interest rates, which has
redirected Italian domestic savings into shares from bonds.
The market's confidence has been boosted by privatisation, which has created
a pool of new shareholders. About 200,000 investors bought into Credito
Italiano, while more than 370,000 applications were received for stock in
the IMI financial services group.
'The success of privatisation could tempt more companies to go public,' said
Mr Luigi Abete, chairman of the Confindustria employers' federation.
Confindustria and the Milan stock market have set up a committee to persuade
more companies to go public.
However, Mr Abete warned Italy's tax rules and the high cost of flotation
remained powerful obstacles. Moreover, 'the market will only accept
companies which show they have a clear development programme,' said Mr
Ventura.
Fiscal factors and the deep-seated reluctance of many entrepreneurs to go
public largely explain why only 220 companies are quoted in Milan, a
fraction of the number in many other big European markets.
'In terms of capitalisation, we rank either ninth or 10th in the world,
whereas the Italian economy is the world's fifth or sixth biggest,' said Mr
Ventura. 'Clearly, the bourse has to make up ground.'

<TEXT>
Iscor, South Africa's iron, steel and coal producer, yesterday reported a 74
per cent rise in pre-tax profit for the half-year ended December.
Pre-tax profit surged to R223m (Dollars 63m) from R128m. Higher sales, up at
R4.77bn from R4.29bn, good cost containment which pushed operating margins
to 7.7 per cent from 6.1 per cent, and a decline in finance charges to R157m
from R179m were responsible for the improvement.
Distributable profit rose to R215m from R125m, equivalent to earnings of
11.5 cents against 6.7 cents a share. The company is paying its dividend in
shares, compared with a 2 cents cash interim dividend last year.
Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said the group's main achievement was to
show positive cash-flow for the first time in four years. Net borrowings
were reduced to R1.93bn at December 31 from R2.06bn six months earlier.
Iscor planned to cut debt by nearly 50 per cent by year-end.

Nissan Motor's European operations should recover and break even in 1995,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'We saw red figures in 1993, and 1994 will be extremely difficult,' said Mr
Tadahiro Shirai, president, but in 1995 European operations should be out of
the red, he added.
Mr Shirai also said European demand had likely hit bottom in 1993 at around
12.5m vehicles. 'In 1994, we do not see a significant increase, maybe 1 or 2
per cent.' But from 1995 demand should increase by about 5 per cent next
year over this year's marginal gain.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Union Miniere to sell US zinc
operations for Dollars 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savage Resources, which eight months ago was a little-known Australian
exploration company selling at 30 cents a share, is to double in size by
acquiring the US zinc operations of Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group,
for USDollars 200m.
The Australian group is buying Union Zinc, which has five low-cost zinc
mines and a 100,000 tonnes a year smelter employing 650 in Tennessee. The
self-contained business accounts for 25 per cent of US zinc output.
This is the second disposal in a week by UM as part of its 1993 long-term
plan to dispose of non-strategic assets to fund investments in its core
business. Last week it sold its 56 per cent stake in Asturienne, the Belgian
mining group.
UM had been planning to float Union Zinc on the American market but
preferred the Savage offer because 'it could be concluded immediately for a
similar return'.
Savage came to prominence because of its successful litigation against
Western Mining of Australia over the Ernest Henry copper-gold deposit in
Queensland. It then sold 51 per cent of Ernest Henry to MIM, another
Australian resources group, for ADollars 92.5m (USDollars 67m).
Savage shares were suspended before the deal at ADollars 1.55. It will fund
the zinc purchase by a five-for-six renounceable rights issue to existing
shareholders at ADollars 1.25 a share and a placement of 50m shares at
ADollars 1.29. The placing will be made to institutional clients of
Prudential Bache Securities (Australia) and Ord Minnet Securities. Both
issues are fully underwritten.
UM and Savage will enter into a commercial relationship cemented by UM
receiving options to acquire 15m Savage shares (less than 5 per cent of the
increased capital). UM is a major cobalt producer. It will help Savage
market zinc and germanium from the US operations.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Atlas Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, has reported a 30 per
cent rise in profits after financial items to SKr1.32bn (Dollars 166m) for
1993.
But the improvement was due in large part to net interest income, with
operating profits after depreciation ahead only 5 per cent at SKr1.18bn. The
weaker underlying earnings left Atlas B shares SKr13 lower at SKr432.
Group sales were up 18 per cent at SKr18.9bn but with 95 per cent of sales
outside Sweden, Atlas said the rise was mainly due to the weakness of the
Swedish krona, which fell by more than 20 per cent in value over the year.
It said demand was weak in Europe, which accounts for more than 50 per cent
of sales, and was expected to remain so in central and southern Europe this
year. But the trend outside Europe was positive, orders overall were up 21
per cent and Atlas said it expected profits in 1994 to be ahead of 1993.
The dividend was set at SKr9.00 per share, up SKr1.00 from the SKr8.00 paid
for 1992. Atlas said it proposed a five-for-one share split, changing the
par value from SKr25.00 to SKr5.00.
A swing to net interest income of SKr88m in 1993 from a loss of SKr118m in
1992 was attributed to favourable interest rate differentials on currency
hedging, lower borrowings and lower interest rates.
Securum, the state-owned Swedish company set up to take on the bad assets of
Nordbanken, has reported a pre-tax loss of SKr16.2bn for 1993, its first
year in existence.
The result illustrates the extent of the problems piled up by state-owned
Nordbanken before the government removed loans and commitments worth SKr67bn
 -mostly in Swedish and European property - into Securum.
Securum said its 1993 loss included credit losses of SKr14.2bn and net
financial expenses of SKr1.8bn.

Harcourt General, the US publishing, retailing and insurance group,
yesterday posted a 29 per cent increase in operating earnings in its first
quarter, thanks to improved performances by all its main businesses.
However, net earnings of Dollars 19.9m, or 25 cents a share, fell well short
of Wall Street's expectations of about 30 cents a share. The stock was
marked down Dollars 1 1/8 on the news and closed at Dollars 34 5/8 for a
loss of Dollars 1 3/4 on the day.
The 1994 results compared with net earnings of Dollars 31.8m, or 40 cents,
in the three months to January 31 1993.
When earnings from Harcourt's discounted cinema operations are excluded from
the year-earlier figures, profits were Dollars 26.8m, or 34 cents, including
a one-time pre-tax gain of Dollars 20.6m related to a legal settlement.
Consolidated revenues from continuing operations increased 3.1 per cent to
Dollars 832m, from Dollars 806m.
Most of the growth came from Harcourt's specialty retailing operations,
which include a 65 per cent stake in the Neiman Marcus department store
group. Sales by the division - Harcourt's largest - climbed 5.8 per cent to
Dollars 507m, from Dollars 479m a year earlier.
By contrast, revenues from its insurance arm fell to Dollars 128m, against
Dollars 138m a year ago.

Magna, the Canadian-based car parts group, doubled second-quarter profits,
mainly because of surging North American vehicle production.
Net income reached a record CDollars 49.7m (USDollars 37m) or 82 cents a
share, up from CDollars 24.7m, or 46 cents a year earlier, on sales of
CDollars 778m, up 30 per cent.
First-half profit was CDollars 96.8m, or CDollars 1.64 a share, up 72 per
cent, on sales of CDollars 1.52bn, up 25 per cent.
Mr Frank Stronach, chairman, estimates total fiscal 1994 sales could reach
CDollars 4bn, up 54 per cent from fiscal 1993.
Magna's production base is mainly North America but it is expanding in
Europe, where it has sales of about Dollars 500m.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: USAir pilots ballot on strike
action in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The labour union representing 390 pilots at a subsidiary of USAir, the US
carrier in which British Airways has a minority stake, yesterday began
balloting members on possible strike action after talks on a new employment
contract reached deadlock.
The subsidiary is Piedmont Airlines, one of three smaller airlines owned by
USAir. These and six independent airlines fly under the USAir Express
banner, operating small turbo-prop aircraft that connect with mainstream
USAir services.
Talks with Piedmont pilots have stumbled over the pilots' requests for
improvements in working conditions that would bring them more closely into
line with those of the larger carriers.
The Air Line Pilots Association argues that pilots at small airlines like
Piedmont accepted inferior conditions in the past because they quickly moved
on to larger airlines, but the contraction of the larger carriers has made
employment at small airlines a long-term career.
USAir and the pilot's union said they hoped a resumption of talks would
prevent a strike. But USAir, which is the most heavily loss-making airline
in the US, will find it difficult to give ground at a time when it is trying
to cut costs and increase productivity in the face of intense competition
from lower-cost rivals.

Strong growth in interest income and lower loan-loss provisions propelled
first-quarter earnings at Toronto-Dominion Bank to their highest level since
early 1990, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The bank, Canada's fifth largest, reported a continuing drop in
non-performing loans, but said its real-estate and forestry portfolios
remain a concern. Net income climbed to CDollars 168m (USDollars 125m), or
52 cents a share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 1m, or a
loss of two cents, a year earlier. The quarterly dividend has been raised 1
cent to 20 cents a share.
Return on equity was 13.5 per cent, against a negative 0.7 per cent. Total
assets grew from CDollars 80.1bn to CDollars 92.4bn. Loan-loss reserves
dipped to CDollars 113m from CDollars 150m.
National Bank of Canada, the country's sixth-biggest chartered bank, posted
a 12 per cent gain in the first quarter, with strong results from its
brokerage unit, higher loan volumes and lower provisions, writes Robert
Gibbens.
Profit was CDollars 50.6m or 27 cents a share for the three months ended
January 31, against CDollars 45m or 28 cents a share on fewer shares
outstanding a year earlier.
Return on average assets was 0.47 per cent against 0.46 per cent, and on
average equity 10.4 per cent against 11 per cent. Loan loss provision was
CDollars 62.5m against CDollars 75m. Total assets were CDollars 42.6bn, up 2
per cent from a year earlier.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Failed deal shows gaps in US
telecoms - Louise Kehoe examines the collapse of talks between Bell Atlantic
and TCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the proposed merger failed between two of the most ambitious companies
in the US communications sector, Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications
(TCI), it reflected a serious lag between regulatory changes and the
restructuring of the industry.
Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone company serving the the middle part of
America's eastern seaboard, and TCI, the largest US cable television
company, would have formed a formidable force in multi-media communications.
But on Wednesday night, the companies announced they were abandoning their
merger, worth more than Dollars 20bn. As Mr Raymond Smith, chairman and
chief executive of Bell Atlantic, put it, 'The unsettled regulatory climate
made it too difficult for the parties to value the future today.'
Earlier in the week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced
regulations to force cable television operators to lower their prices. It
was prompted by 1992 legislation addressing concerns that the cable industry
was abusing local monopolies and raising its prices excessively. The planned
Bell Atlantic-TCI merger was built on the premise that, in the
not-too-distant future, such monopolies and those of regional telephone
companies, will disappear.
The FCC's move to lower cable TV prices appears to have been the last straw
in the protracted negotiations between Bell Atlantic and TCI. The companies
had twice extended the deadline for the completion of their merger talks,
which began last October. Mr Smith said they had finally resolved their
differences and were close to reaching a definitive agreement; but the FCC's
actions 'made reaching a final agreement on the transaction impossible'.
TCI issued a statement strongly criticising the FCC's action as
'unwarranted, excessively severe, and harmful both to the national
telecommunications objectives promoted by the Clinton administration and,
ultimately, to the interests of consumers'.
The cable TV company said it will join others in legal challenges to the FCC
actions. It also announced it will suspend Dollars 500m, or half of its
planned capital spending for 1994, pending further clarification of the
FCC's regulations.
Bell Atlantic said the FCC action, requiring US cable TV companies to lower
prices for basic services by 7 per cent, must have raised questions about
the valuation placed on TCI in the talks.
Mr James Cullen, president of Bell Atlantic, said: 'The FCC announcement
reduced the price to the point where TCI did not feel it could recommend the
transaction to its shareholders.'
However, Mr Reed Hundt, FCC chairman, rejected suggestions that the agency's
action had undermined the deal. He said the price cut 'did not in any way
make the future of the cable industry more unsettled'.
Another factor in the deal's collapse may have been weakness in Bell
Atlantic's share price, which fell from Dollars 67 in mid-October when the
deal was announced to close at Dollars 53 1/4 on Wednesday, before the
companies announced the abortion of the merger.
Whatever the reasons, the failure of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal seems sure
to cool the excitement surrounding the 'convergence' of the US
communications, television, computer and entertainment industries to create
nation-wide 'information superhighways'.
The Bell Atlantic-TCI merger, creating what Mr Smith had boasted would be 'a
model for communications companies in the next century', had become the
symbol of a new era of unregulated communications. Such an environment would
free technology companies to create multi-media communications services,
ranging from desktop video conferencing to interactive television.
The Clinton administration has made the creation of such advanced
communication services an important element of its economic policy, with
Vice-President Al Gore regularly promoting the social and economic benefits
of the 'information superhighway'. Only a few weeks ago, the Vice-President
assured industry leaders that 'this administration will not let existing
regulatory structures impede or distort the evolution of the communications
industry'.
The collapse of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal is therefore likely to
reverberate in Washington, putting increased pressure on the administration
to come up with an overdue legislative package to revamp communications
regulations.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: US court ruling threatens PC
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US personal computer industry was yesterday bracing itself for
potentially serious disruption of its sales, following a court verdict that
Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system software
infringes two patents held by Stac Electronics, a California software
company.
A Los Angeles jury found on Wednesday that Microsoft has incorporated data
compression features in the latest versions of its MS-DOS operating system
that infringe Stac's patents, and ordered Microsoft to pay Dollars 120m in
compensatory damages. Microsoft is to take a charge in the current quarter,
reducing earnings by 26 cents per share.
The court was yesterday considering whether to issue an injunction ordering
Microsoft to halt sales of MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2, the current versions of the
operating system that are pre-loaded on most PCs. If granted, the injunction
could temporarily halt shipments of personal computers in the US.
Microsoft said it would issue new versions that do not include the data
compression features later this week.
'We do not anticipate any material disruption of the supply of MS-DOS
products,' said Bill Neukom, Microsoft senior vice-president of law and
corporate affairs, 'but we are not saying that this will not cause
disruption in the PC industry.'
Microsoft officials acknowledged they were assuming that personal computers
already shipped to retailers would not be affected. However, Mr Gary Clow,
president and chief executive of Stac Electronics, said he understood the
award was on the basis of shipments up to the end of January.
If Mr Clow is correct, PC retailers could be forced to return PCs to
manufacturers to replace the software. If Microsoft's view prevails, PC
manufacturers will have to swap the software they are installing in PCs. In
either case, PC sales could be interrupted.
Stac said it will seek 'the maximum relief available under the law' in its
request for an injunction. However, Mr Clow said the company had no
intention of disrupting PC shipments. 'Our beef is with Microsoft, not the
PC makers,' said Mr Clow.
Stac Electronics' data compression technology doubles the amount of data
that can be stored on a personal computer hard disk file. Microsoft
initially sought to license Stac's technology.
Mr Clow said he held licensing negotiations with Microsoft in 1992, but the
companies had been unable to reach agreement. Subsequently, Microsoft
introduced MS-DOS 6.0, a new version of its PC operating system that
includes data compression technology.
While the court ruled that Microsoft's data compression method infringes
Stac's patents, the jury said the infringement was not 'wilful'.
Microsoft plans to ask the judge to overturn the ruling and, if he refuses,
will appeal, the company said.
The court also awarded damages of Dollars 13.6m to Microsoft, for Stac's use
of Microsoft trade secrets.

A surge in catalogue sales helped J C Penney, the US department store group,
report a 17 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 437m from Dollars
375m for the fourth quarter to January.
J C Penney, the biggest catalogue retailer in the US, saw a 23 per cent
increase in catalogue sales for the quarter, largely because the rival Sears
group pulled out of the business last year.
The profits rise in this quarter helped counter a decline in gross margins
at the department stores, which the group attributed to an intensely
competitive retail environment during the Christmas season.
Turnover for the quarter rose to Dollars 6.32bn from Dollars 6.09bn while
cost cutting reduced selling, general and administrative expenses from
Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 1.49bn. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose from
Dollars 1.42 to Dollars 1.64.
For the full year, net income rose by 21 per cent to Dollars 940m from
Dollars 777m, on turnover up from Dollars 18.01bn to Dollars 18.98bn.
Earnings per share were Dollars 3.53, against Dollars 2.95 last time.
Mr William Howell, chairman, said the group's collection of own-label brands
coupled with a good collection of national brands maximised its ability to
offer value to customers. Sales so far in 1994 indicated a healthy year, he
said.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong last term gives AIG
record year with Dollars 1.94bn

American International Group, the US property/casualty insurer, yesterday
unveiled an 11 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars
510.2m, or Dollars 1.61 a share.
The strong final quarter lifted full-year earnings to a record Dollars
1.94bn, or Dollars 6.11. In 1992, the group earned Dollars 1.66bn, or
Dollars 5.20.
The figures include net realised capital gains and the impact of accounting
changes, which were reported as Dollars 11.5m for the quarter and Dollars
89m for the year.
AIG said group revenues rose 10.2 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 5.36bn,
and 9.5 per cent in the year to Dollars 20.13bn.
Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, said the strong quarterly and annual results
reflected the increase in operating income reported by all of AIG's three
main businesses - general insurance, life insurance and financial services.
He singled out the performance of the group's Asian operations, particularly
its new life and non-life insurance operations in China, which he said had
an 'outstanding' debut.
The annual results were boosted by significantly lower catastrophe losses
last year than in 1992 when the insurance industry paid out large sums
following Hurricane Andrew and other big disasters. Catastrophe losses for
1993 were Dollars 69.5m, down from Dollars 191.7m the year before.
One positive side-effect of the 1992 disasters was that it led to a
strengthening in the reinsurance market in the form of higher premiums and
new capital. Also, AIG said insurance rates had risen in several overseas
markets.
General insurance premiums written by the group climbed almost 10 per cent
to more than Dollars 10bn last year, which helped lift operating income from
the general insurance business 28 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn. In the
quarter, income climbed 21 per cent to Dollars 356.4m.
AIG's financial services group prospered, with operating income rising 12.6
per cent to Dollars 390m.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (8): On course for
multimedia age - Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past few years, executives at Japanese telecommunications companies
have watched anxiously as their US counterparts moved swiftly to lay the
foundations for a new era of advanced communications.
While US companies in the telecommunications, cable TV and entertainment
industries joined hands in one cross-border deal after another, Japanese
telecoms operators and equipment suppliers have grown concerned about their
country's delayed entry into the race to develop advanced information
networks.
The ministry of posts and telecommunications, criticised in the past for its
bureaucratic approach, has now recognised the need to improve the regulatory
environment and has put Japan firmly on course for the coming multimedia
age.
Last month, Mr Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications,
indicated the government's intention to nurture the development of advanced
information communications networks as a key sector for the future Japanese
economy.
The multimedia market in Japan, Mr Kanzaki declared, was expected to create
2.4m jobs by 2010 and could be worth Y123,000bn (Dollars 1,138bn) by that
year, making it comparable in size to the motor, electronics and
communications equipment industries.
To promote the development of advanced information networks the ministry
plans to support the laying of an optic fibre infrastructure nationwide and
wants this to be completed by 2010.
Rules will be relaxed to create an environment more conducive to the
emergence of new businesses taking advantage of the info-communications
networks.
The ministry is also examining policy and technical issues that need to be
addressed before it can give the go-ahead for the integration of
telecommunications and broadcasting services.
Growing alarm that Japan is being left behind by the US in the race to
develop advanced communications systems has spurred the hitherto complacent
Japanese authorities into action. They face a formidable task.
On the broad policy front, the ministry must decide who will fund the laying
of the proposed advanced communications network, and therefore have ultimate
control over it, and who ought to be allowed to use it and in what ways.
On both points it is in direct opposition to NTT, the former public
telephone company which was privatised in 1986 and which, in spite of
liberalisation efforts by the ministry, still dominates the industry.
NTT believes it should build the network and has stated its plan to lay
optical cables to all private homes by 2015. By March next year, NTT plans
to complete digitisation of its switches throughout Japan, an essential part
of the multimedia infrastructure.
The company wants to retain its leading position in advanced
telecommunications and believes that because it will have to manage the
network, it should be allowed to build it.
The telecommunications ministry disagrees. If the private sector builds an
advanced communications network, it fears the interests of the country may
not be best served. The ministry is concerned that private companies, driven
by profit considerations, could lay optic fibre only where they can expect
satisfactory returns.
The differences between the ministry and NTT extend to the issue of who
should be able to provide what kind of services on the new information
highway.
Not surprisingly, NTT is keen to use its dominant position as a carrier to
provide new services beyond its conventional telephone operations. In
addition to high-speed communications services, the company is eyeing
markets for video communications, interactive games and video shopping,
among others.
'NTT will co-operate with a diversity of industry players as it explores the
vast potential of these arenas,' the company says.
However, NTT's activities are strictly regulated by the NTT law, which
stipulates that the company may not engage in businesses outside
telecommunications and other closely related activities.
The ministry of posts and telecommunications is wary of NTT becoming too
dominant in these industries. So, unless the law is revised the telecoms
giant would be barred from using any new network it builds to provide cable
TV and Mr Masashi Kojima, the company's president, publicly states that 'NTT
does not intend to get involved in the cable television business'.
That leaves other carriers and the cable companies as leading contenders to
combine telecommunications and broadcasting services on the new information
highway.
The authorities are planning to allow cable television operators to provide
'full' services, including telecommunications services, and to permit new
common carriers to offer multimedia services.
Recently, the telecoms ministry announced its intention to relax rules which
have been widely blamed for stunting the growth of the cable industry.
The local capital rule, which prevented companies from providing nationwide
services and thereby taking advantage of economies of scale, is being phased
out. Foreign capital restrictions are also being relaxed, leading to the
possibility of increased participation in the Japanese market by large US
cable companies such as TCI, which has a deal with Sumitomo, the trading
house.
It will take some time for Japan's fragmented cable TV industry to sort
itself out to become a force capable of participating in the
info-communications network as envisioned by the telecoms authorities.
Neither is it clear what uses consumers will want to make of the high-speed
capacity and interactive functions offered by the new information super
highways.
Meanwhile, steps are also being taken in the mobile phones industry to allow
greater competition and more diversified services and to pave the way for
the advanced information communications infrastructure. As in the cable TV
industry, most of these involve the relaxation of ministry rules which are
blamed for inhibiting growth in this industry.
For example, the ministry is liberalising the cellular phone market further
by allowing three new entrants into the market in April. Handsets, which
have to be rented by an operator, will be allowed to be sold, leading to
greater competition and lower prices.
Such long-awaited steps are expected to trigger significant growth in
Japan's cellular phone market, which in spite of being the second largest
market after the US with 1.8m subscribers, has a low diffusion rate. Only
1.8 per cent of Japanese use mobile phones compared with 4.4 in the US and
7.9 per cent in Sweden, according to a report by SG Warburg, the securities
company. Deregulation which will lead to greater competition and price
reductions, is expected to make Japan one of the world's fastest growing
markets.
