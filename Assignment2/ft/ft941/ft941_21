FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (9): Metamorphosis
in progress - Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like so much of Australian industry, the telecommunications sector is in a
state of upheaval as it moves from a regulated, government-controlled
environment, into the world of competition and free-market economics.
Five years ago, the industry was made up of three principal entities, all
wholly-owned by the federal government. First, there was the Australian
Telecommunications Commission, or in popular parlance, Telecom, which
provided the nation's domestic telecommunications services. Then there was
the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, or OTC, which provided
international telecommunications services.
Finally, there was the loss-making Aussat, which was responsible for the
country's domestic satellite communications system. Aussat had been set up
as a space-based competitor to Telecom but, for a variety of reasons -
including inadequate funding and regulatory restrictions - had effectively
failed in its task.
Today, the industry's structure has changed radically - although it will be
another three and a half years before the metamorphosis is complete.
Telecom and the OTC were merged in February 1992, and last year adopted the
new legal name of Telstra Corporation. The organisation still trades as
Telecom in its domestic market, but uses the Telstra tag overseas.
At present, Telstra remains wholly-owned by the federal government, and the
notion of a wholesale privatisation of the organisation is politically
contentious. Both Australia's powerful union movement and the Labor Party
caucus have been strongly opposed to this and in the run-up to the 1993
general election, Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, formally
pledged that Labor would retain Telecom as a publicly-owned enterprise, if
re-elected.
However, under its American chief executive, Frank Blount, Telstra does
seems to be nudging its way towards the private sector, and most
commentators believe that some private sector involvement is inevitable in
the medium to longer term. There has been talk more recently of floating off
parts of the business - say, some of its international interests or its
fledgling cable operation - or bringing in joint venture partners on a
limited basis. Such schemes would help to fund expansion, it argued, without
draining public funds.
Meanwhile, Optus was licensed as the second telecommunications carrier in
early 1992, providing Australian consumers with a rival carrier to Telstra.
Optus is owned by a consortium of international interests. These include
Britain's Cable and Wireless, which holds a 24.5 per cent interest in Optus:
BellSouth of the US, with a similar percentage, Mayne Nickless, the
Australian transport company, with 20 per cent, and a number of leading
Australian institutional investors. Despite the UK-US involvement, however,
the Australian interests have always held a majority of the company's
shares.
Aussat, meanwhile, was sold to Optus for ADollars 800m - of which ADollars
500m was paid up front with the remainder coming in instalment payment
starting at end-1994 - and effectively becomes a division within the new
group.
Optus began its life by competing against Telecom in the cellular telephone
market, but by December 1992, had expanded into long-distance services. In
1993, a series of high-profile ballots took place in Australia, giving
customers a well-publicised opportunity to switch carriers. Although
response rates varied between different cities, Optus saw a very encouraging
reception in some cities - picking up a fifth of the Sydney market, for
example.
At present, then, Australia operates a duopoly. This, however, is meant to
be an interim arrangement only, and the government's declared aim is to
introduce full network competition by mid-1997. Optus, which began life by
leasing existing network capacity from Telecom for about 90 per cent of its
traffic, is expected to be 90 per cent independent by this stage. The
company has talked of a ADollars 4bn investment plan, to make its
long-distance service accessible to all Australians, and to bring its
cellular services to a large portion of the population.
Finally, the most recent development on the deregulation front has been the
opening of the mobile telephone market to a third carrier - Vodafone of the
UK. The company began to offer digital mobile telephone services in Sydney,
Melbourne and Canberra last October, and is expected to extend its network
to accommodate about 85 per cent of the population by 1996.
Vodafone's entry was timely. Telecom and Optus had snared around 750,000
mobile phone customers on their analogue networks, but this system was close
to saturation. (It is due to be phased out by 2000).
The two domestic rivals had introduced digital services earlier in the year,
ahead of Vodafone's arrival, but acceptance of the new system had been slow.
Vodafone's aggressive entry was seen as a welcome boost to the flagging
digital market.
More broadly, there is little doubt that growth in the Australian
telecommunications market is coming on the international side. International
traffic expanded by around 70 per cent between 1988/89 and 1991/2, whle
domestic traffic rose only 20 per cent in the same period, according to a
Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report last year.
The same report suggests that, assuming 'only modest growth in the world's
major economies', international traffic to and from Australia should
continue to grow at around 15-20 per cent annually in the years ahead.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bankers fail to see trading room
joke - Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board is on the defensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a joke told in the dealing rooms of Frankfurt which explains the
debacle at Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial
group which came to the brink of collapse last month.
Bankers, it is said, only read the documents pertaining to the companies
where they are supervisory members when they are being driven to supervisory
board meetings. This happens four times a year, and normally there is an
hour or more to look through the papers on the journey from Frankfurt.
However, because Metallgesellschaft's head office is only 200 metres away
from Deutsche Bank's own headquarters in the heart of Frankfurt, the bankers
never had time to read the documents - hence it's really no surprise that
the group nearly went bust.
The joke encapsulates the widely-held view that supervisory board members do
not take their responsibilities for overseeing a company's affairs
seriously, a view which Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who
is also chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, did his utmost
to rebut yesterday.
Addressing thousands of shareholders at Metallgesellschaft's extraordinary
meeting, convened to approve the DM3.4bn (Dollars 2bn) rescue plan agreed
with banks last month, Schmitz defended his own actions since taking over as
chairman of the the supervisory board in March last year.
Criticism has focused on the fact that the supervisory board failed to
prevent an explosion in oil futures business at Metallgesellschaft's
US-based MG Corp subsidiary. The speculative business gave rise to losses of
DM2.3bn, which drove the group to the brink of bankruptcy.
In a confident, forthright performance, Mr Schmitz laid the blame for the
debacle with Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief executive, and
with Mr Meinhard Forster, the former finance director, both of whom were
sacked at Mr Schmitz's initiative on December 17 last year.
Giving an unusual level of detail about the relationship between the
supervisory board chairman and the management board, Mr Schmitz said he
intensified supervision of Mr Schimmelbusch to extraordinary levels, as
shown by his initial unwillingness to prolong his contract as chief
executive. His scepticism was based on the group's poor operating
performance, he explained.
Far from 'going to sleep', as critics have alleged, Mr Schmitz portrayed
himself as bringing a high degree of activism to the job. He said he held 11
one-to-one meetings with Mr Schimmelbusch during 1993, and that the group's
weaknesses were systematically addressed at a further 19 meetings involving
the supervisory board and other committees.
KPMG, the group's auditor, was appointed in the summer to examine the risks
inherent in MG Corp's trading activities, and Mr Schmitz held talks with Mr
Schimmelbusch as early as April 1993 about controlling, 'including the
question of risk management in trading'.
Mr Schmitz said the first he had heard from Mr Schimmelbusch about liquidity
problems at MG Corp was on December 3. Before then, 'the information
supplied by the management board was, as it later transpired, incomplete and
untrue as regards to the risks from the oil transactions'. The risks were
clearly hidden from other members of the management board, Mr Schmitz said.
'Evidently not all members (of the management board) were appraised of the
situation,' he said.
Even his argument that documents were falsified was not enough to win over
Mr Herbert Hansen, a representative of small shareholders who spoke after Mr
Schmitz had finished. He asked, incredulously, whether an even bigger
disaster had to take place 'before anything happened to a member of a
supervisory board'. He said Mr Schmitz and all the other representatives of
capital (as opposed to labour) on the board should resign.
For Mr Schmitz, resignation is clearly out of the question. He maintained
yesterday that the supervisory board had done more than could have been
expected of it, under the circumstances, and that without its prompt and
unprecedented action in ousting Mr Schimmelbusch and his boardroom
colleagues, Metallgesellschaft would definitely have gone bankrupt.
Moreover, the 'German system' of close relations between industry and banks
had proved itself. 'Without the stability and strength of the shareholder
banks and major shareholders, Metallgesellschaft would be undergoing
insolvency proceedings and criticism of the banks would then be even
louder,' Mr Schmitz claimed.
It was possible to learn something from Anglo-American best practice - in
future, the Deutsche Bank would consider introducing a form of 'audit
committee' for the companies in which it has a major stake, he said.
However, an audit committee would not have prevented the Metallgesellschaft
case, Mr Schmitz insisted.

<TEXT>
Westdeutsche Landesbank, the largest of Germany's public sector banks,
yesterday reported a 45 per cent increase in operating profit for 1993, to
DM803m (Dollars 456.2m).
Net profit was up 53 per cent to DM334m compared with DM218.6m in 1992,
according to figures released by the bank in Dusseldorf.
The main factors behind the sharp improvement were a 24 per cent increase in
net interest income, up from DM2.47bn to DM3.08bn, and a 56.5 per cent
increase in profits from trading, which increased to DM301m.
With total assets of DM320bn - up from DM274.2bn in 1992 - WestLB, house
bank to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is Germany's third largest
bank, and the only public sector institution able to compete directly with
the big private-sector rivals.
The state government's shareholding amounts to 43 per cent, with savings
banks controlling 33 per cent, and local authorities the rest.
WestLB said its risk provision was increased by 63 per cent, from DM596m to
DM972m, reflecting not only a provision for the bank's lending operations,
but also its assessment of the risks involved in its investment and equity
portfolio.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spain considers reducing Repsol
shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government is considering making an international offering of
Repsol shares that could reduce the public sector's shareholding in the
energy and chemicals group from 41.1 per cent to close to 20 per cent.
A government official confirmed that a further reduction of public ownership
of Repsol was being examined, but would not comment on the extent and the
timing of the share offer.
The offering has been provisionally scheduled for the second half of the
year. This will allow the markets to absorb a 10 per cent share offering,
due within the next three months, by the state-owned electricity generator
and distributor Endesa. This offering will reduce the state's equity to
below 60 per cent.
The government gave up majority control of Repsol last year when it placed
13 per cent of its equity on the market, reducing its shareholding from 54.1
per cent to 41.1 per cent. That share offer realised Pta110bn (Dollars
783m): at current market prices a 20 per cent offering would be worth
Pta276bn.
The share offer also has to await the acquisition by Gas Natural, the big
domestic gas distributor 45 per cent-owned by Repsol, of Enagas, the fully
state-owned monopoly supplier of industrial gas. The takeover, which will
create one of the biggest natural gas companies in Europe, is expected to be
announced before the end of next month.
Repsol lifted 1993 consolidated profit by 28.3 per cent, to Pta156.8bn, and
its net profit by 11.4 per cent, to Pta80.1bn, on revenues of Pta2,216bn, 16
per cent up on 1993. Slack demand for petroleum products, and a drop in
revenue from oil exploration and production, were offset by the impact of
the weaker peseta and higher refining margins.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Argentaria joins Banesto contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentaria, the partially-privatised Spanish banking corporation, has become
the latest contender to control Banesto, the ailing banking group to be
auctioned among the domestic financial community late next month.
To prepare its bid, Argentaria yesterday hired the US bank Goldman Sachs to
evaluate a rescue plan, drawn up by Banesto and by the Bank of Spain, which
aims to recapitalise Banesto and absorb its estimated Pta605bn (Dollars
4.3bn) overvalued assets.
Banco Santander announced three weeks ago it was studying the wisdom of
bidding for Banesto. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) a rival big bank, is
expected to publicly declare its interest at its AGM tomorrow.
Under the terms of the rescue plan, subject to the approval of Banesto's
shareholders, a strategic domestic buyer will acquire a minimum of 35 per
cent of Banesto's reconstituted share capital.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: AGF to take control of Spanish
insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France, the French state-owned insurance group, has
reached agreement to take majority control of loss-making Spanish insurer La
Union y El Fenix.
The deal announced yesterday with Banesto, the beleaguered bank for which a
rescue plan is being drawn up under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, came
after about 10 months of negotiations.
The French group will take over Banesto's majority share of a joint holding
company which in turn owns 52 per cent of the insurer.
The agreement is regarded as an important strategic move for AGF, which has
been seeking to expand its presence in the Spanish market. It also removes
an element of uncertainty ahead of the group's planned privatisation later
this year.
Under the provisional agreement, shareholders in El Fenix and AGF Seguros,
the French group's Spanish offshoot, will be asked to approve a merger
through the exchange of one AGF Seguros share for seven El Fenix shares.
The nominal value of AGF shares will be reduced before the operation from
Pta5,000 to Pta500, the same as El Fenix's.
These terms differ markedly from an original plan drawn up last year which
envisaged a three-for-one share swap.

Columbia Pictures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the Japanese electronics company which owns Columbia Pictures,
confirmed yesterday there had been approaches by several parties interested
in buying a stake in its US film studio.
However, it stressed it had not yet made a decision about any sale. 'We are
not soliciting such approaches, but we are open to those that we do
receive,' Mr Tsutomu Sugiyama, assistant general manager of corporate
communications in Tokyo, said yesterday.
Sony, which bought the Hollywood film studio for Dollars 3.4bn in 1989, has
been burdened by the huge amount of debt it took on to fund the Columbia
acquisition.
Added to this, Sony's film business has been hit by the failure of the movie
Last Action Hero, which is believed to have made a huge loss.
However, Mr Sugiyama said video and other income was still expected from the
film, which features Arnold Schwarzenegger. Therefore, it was 'premature to
discuss such figures'.
Industry analysts believe it would make commercial sense for Sony to link
with an outside partner, particularly a cable-TV or telephone company in the
US which could provide it with an entry into the multimedia business.
A partnership involving the sale of a stake in Columbia would relieve Sony
of some of its nearly Dollars 10bn debt.
It could also have other advantages. Such a deal could provide Sony with
cable-TV network operating expertise, an expanded outlet for its software
assets and, eventually, a head start in the Japanese cable-TV and multimedia
market, says S. G. Warburg, the securities company.
Sony's share price rose Y160 to Y6,300 in Tokyo yesterday.
Although its overall performance has shown a slight pick-up, Sony is
predicting that consolidated net income in the year to March 31, will fall
45 per cent to Y20bn (Dollars 190m), compared with an earlier forecast of
Y30bn.

FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Net at Leu Holding surges 83%
for year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leu Holding, part of the CS Holding financial group, has reported
consolidated net income of SFr190m (Dollars 131m) for 1993, an 83 per cent
rise on 1992.
Leu, which is active internationally in private banking and in the Zurich
area in commercial banking, said all subsidiaries contributed to the strong
performance, due in part to healthy growth in earnings from commission
business and securities trading.
Total assets at the end of last year were down 5 per cent, to SFr16.4bn, but
shareholders' equity gained 9 per cent to SFr1.9bn. Return on equity rose
from 6.1 per cent to 10.4 per cent.
CS Holding bought all the shares of Leu it did not already own in a public
offer last December.
Net income in 1993 at Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium, packaging and
chemicals group, was slightly higher than the SFr80m indicated two weeks ago
when a SFr400m rights issue was announced.
The group said yesterday its 1993 net income was SFr83m, 31 per cent lower
than in 1992. It blamed the fall on dreadful conditions in the aluminium
business.
The directors anticipate a 'considerable' recovery this year, largely as a
result of loss elimination from restructuring, and are proposing a
maintained dividend.
Sales of the aluminium division were off 7.7 per cent to SFr2.7bn, and its
operating income plunged 39.5 per cent to SFr95m.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (5): Be patient,
westerners urged - China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western telecommunication giants eyeing the vast Chinese market will need to
be patient since it seems that in spite of domestic pressures the
authorities are in no hurry to open this lucrative sector to foreign
involvement.
Professor Li Yining, an influential economist and member of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, wrote in a
commentary last month that the country was 'not ready for a change of
policy'. But Prof Li went on to say that when market conditions 'matured'
there was 'no reason why foreign businesses cannot take part in the
operations of telecommunications networks in China'.
He listed three necessary developments: a strengthening of the local
telecommunications industry so that it was no longer dependent on
preferential government treatment and subsidies; technical improvements that
would allow it to compete internationally; and due consideration of charges
for services and the sharing of revenues.
'These issues need to be studied carefully,' he wrote. 'And as these
problems are essentially technical in nature, it seems highly likely that
they can be resolved in the future.''
Prof Li's remarks reflect what is proving to be a hot debate in China
between advocates of liberalisation and a state telecommunications sector
fearful of losing its monopoly.
These issues came to the surface late last year when the Mr Huang Ju,
Shanghai's reformist mayor, told leading western telecoms operators that he
favoured a 'pilot' project in his city under which foreign operators would
invest in building and operating a new network.
Mr Huang's remarks were quickly denied by officials of the ministry of posts
and telecommunications (MPT) which periodically seeks to dampen expectations
of an early lifting of the ban on foreigners becoming involved in the
telecommunications business - either as equity partners or in a management
role.
The MPT's monopoly is, in any case, being eroded in various ways, especially
in the area of cordless telephones and pagers. The continuing proliferation
of satellite dishes, in spite of a recent government edict banning the
unauthorised sale of such dishes, is another affront to MPT control.
In Beijing alone, some 70 private paging firms are operating, and there are
at least 300,000 pager users in the capital. In a country where there are an
average of 1.6 telephones per head of population, the pager market is
virtually unlimited.
Investment by Champion Technology, a Hong Kong telecommunications firm, in a
cellular phone network in Sichuan province, China's most populous province,
may well come to be regarded as the thin edge of the wedge as far as foreign
penetration is concerned.
Champion representatives say that while the company has a 40 per cent stake
in the Sichuan network, it will have no direct management involvement in its
joint venture with the local Sichuan branch of the MPT and the People's
Liberation Army.
This 'arm's-length' arrangement could become a model for other such
ventures, although it is hard to believe Champion, with its 40 per cent
stake and USDollars 30m investment, will either wish to, or be able to, stay
out of management decisions.
MPT also has a battle on its hands with powerful domestic foes agitating for
the right to establish a second national telecommunications network. Three
ministries (electronics, railways and electric power), together with the
People's Bank of China and the People's Liberation Army, among other
enterprises are working behind the scenes to break MPT's monopoly.
MPT officials say they are doing their best to meet huge demand for new
services, and have outlined ambitious plans to improve the network. China,
which has one of the world's lowest per capita ratios of telephone lines -
at the end of 1993 the number had reached about 18m for a population of
1.17bn - plans to increase the number of lines fivefold to 100m lines by
2,000.
Wu Jichuan, China's minister of post and telecommunications, said recently
that by the end of the decade China planned to achieve 'telephone
penetration' of 35 to 45 per cent (of families) in the larger cities. At
present fewer than one in 10 urban families on average has a telephone.
MPT has budgeted about Yn53.6bn (USDollars 6.1bn) in expenditures this year,
an increase of 34 per cent over 1993, but given the ministry's vast
responsibilities investment available for telecommunications is clearly
inadequate.
Among MPT's priorities is to extend its network of large and medium-sized
satellite earth stations to all provincial capitals by early next century.
Some 16 such facilities are either operational or are under construction.
China also plans to increase the number of communications satellites in
orbit, and to make greater use of other international vehicles.
According to a China Daily article, by the year 1995 China will be using
seven communications satellites, including two Chinese-made
Dongfanghong-111's, each equipped with 24 transponders.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (6): No escaping
the call of duty - Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They have been formally banned from cinemas, and top-ranking restaurants
will remove them before the aperitifs arrive. But in all other daily
activities - on the buses and underground trains, in the gyms and at the
noodle stalls; in banks and post office queues - there is no escaping the
call of the mobile phone.
Telephones and staying in contact appear to be as embedded in the Hong Kong
culture as eating and karaoke. Last year the colony's 6m population spent
1.31bn minutes on (outgoing) international calls, some 40 per cent of which
were to China.
More than 65 per cent have telephones; and analysts reckon around 5 per cent
have cellular phones. According to Hongkong Telecom, there are 1.24m pagers
on the streets, alerting people to messages as well as stocks and racing
information.
'A lot of local people are entrepreneurs, and they have to keep in contact
with others while on the move. Second, there is a strong fixed line
infrastructure in Hong Kong which has cultivated a strong telecommunications
culture,' says Mr Carl Wong, telecoms analyst with Wardley James Capel.
The fixed line infrastructure, courtesy of Hongkong Telecom - which next
July loses its monopoly to provide local telephone services - is so strong
that analysts reckon the scope for head-on competition will be pretty thin.
Not surprisingly, the competitors-elect disagree.
Hongkong Telecom, 57 per cent owned by Cable and Wireless, charges
residential users HKDollars 59.30 a month for the line rental plus HKDollars
9 a month for the rental of the equipment itself. But after that, everything
 -bar international calls - comes free of charge, including all local calls.
Further undermining the argument for commercial competition, anyone setting
up in the local loop network generating international calls has to pay
Telecom 92 per cent of the international revenues for delivery of the
international part. Hongkong Telecom retains its monopoly on international
services - the area which generates the bulk of its profits - until 2006.
Mr Peter Howell-Davies, deputy chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, says
early market research suggests the company's plans to launch a video on
demand service will be well received. Telecom is launching a pilot scheme in
July this year: all being well, a full service will be rolled out in early
1995.
The company has also applied for a cable TV licence with effect from June
1996, when Wharf's exclusive franchise expires.
Liberalisation of the fixed wire telecoms market first beckoned in 1992,
sparking off a lengthy review. The government believes that competition will
reduce costs for consumers, who will be able to save HKDollars 1.7bn in real
terms over the next 10 years. Last December it unveiled the names of those
whose bids to operate competitive local services against Hongkong Telecom
had been successful: Hutchison Whampoa, Wharf Holdings and New World.
All three are big conglomerates, better known for their involvement in
property than telecoms.
Hutchison Whampoa - barely a month before the government announcement -
decided to write off its ailing UK CT2 business and clarify its exposure to
the Personal Communications Network, a digital cellular-based service for
two-way mobile communications.
The write-off cost Hutchison HKDollars 1.42bn - which was coincidentally
offset by profits made earlier in the year on the sale of Star TV - and the
company vowed to plough some HKDollars 4bn capital into its PCN operations
over the next three to four years.
All three companies plan to enter the market with big budgets to fuel their
proposals for large-scale fixed-line networks, and have hooked up with
big-name partners to assist them in cashing in on the new market.
Hutchison Communications is a joint effort with Telstra, Australia's
state-controlled telecommunications giant; Wharf Holdings has teamed up with
Nynex (US) to create New T&amp;T Hong Kong, and New World Development has a 65.5
per cent stake in a consortium made up of Infa Telecom Asia, US West and
Shanghai Long Distance.
Wharf is spending HKDollars 6bn on top of the HKDollars 5bn for Wharf Cable;
Hutchison has earmarked HKDollars 3.5bn and New World Development's initial
investment is around HKDollars 2bn.
The companies themselves believe there is money to be made by competing
head-on with Hongkong Telecom, and are looking at all the non-international
services provided by the existing provider as fair game for competition.
The switch from monopoly must be approved by China, which regains
sovereignity in 1997, and all three companies plus their partners are now
awaiting the green light from the Joint Liaison Group.
Ironically, the government says the JLG should be discussing the issue of
licences to the newcomers around March - the time when Mr Chris Patten,
governor, is due to lodge the so-called controversial parts of his democracy
bill to the Legislative Council.
The four cellular operators - Hongkong Telecom CSL, Hutchison, Pacific Link
and Smart Tone - are augmented by some 15 participants in the paging network
and three CT2 operators.
For Hong Kong's movers and shakers, spending around USDollars 1,00 to
USDollars 1,500 on a piece of equipment that will ensure they can always be
reached and stay in touch with their office is a small price to pay.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (7): Victim of
success - Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first half of 1993 sales of mobile phones in Malaysia were averaging
about 8,000 per month. But after a surge in the Kuala Lumpur stock market,
brokers started giving mobile phones to their bigger clients. The result?
Mobile phone sales leapt to more than 15,000 a month and, along the way, the
shares of companies involved in mobile phones soared.
However, business growth has created problems. Many mobile phone users now
complain that they are finding it increasingly difficult to find lines. The
companies concerned and the government insist that the problems in the
system will soon be rectified.
Malaysia's gross domestic product has expanded by more than 8 per cent in
each of the last six years. Similar growth is expected this year.
The difficulties in the mobile communications sector are common to many
areas in Malaysia. The country is having difficulty managing its success.
Congestion and bottlenecks threaten growth.
The critics say that the problems are most serious in the telecommunications
sector.
There is an urgent need for the government to formulate an overall
telecommunications policy: if not, development could be hampered.
Malaysia has been one of the first countries in Asia to privatise its
telecommunications industry. In the mid-80s Telekom Malaysia, the
telecommunications utility, became a corporation. In late 1990, 25 per cent
of the company was floated on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. At the end of
1993, Telekom had a market capitalisation of MDollars 43.8bn (Dollars
16.3bn) and was ranked as the second biggest listed company in Malaysia.
In the year to December 31, 1992, Telekom had pre-tax profits of MDollars
1.275bn - an 18 per cent rise over the previous year's figure. While Telekom
still has a monopoly on many services, the government has made it clear that
it wants more competition to be introduced into the sector.
The cellular market has been opened to three companies besides Telekom. The
biggest, Celcom, now has an estimated 60 per cent of the cellular phone
market. Over the next 12 months Celcom says it aims to increase its number
of subscribers from 200,000 to more than 500,000. But Celcom has to sort out
congestion problems on its network. If not, two new competitors, Mobikom and
Binariang, are likely to steal market share.
The government has also suggested that a second carrier network will be
allowed to start operating. Already Celcom has been granted so-called second
international gateway rights - allowing it to set up an international
service to rival Telekom's.
Other companies - such as Sapura, a manufacturer of a wide variety of
telecommunications equipment - are expanding aggressively overseas.
The government is unlikely to allow Telekom's position as network carrier
within the country to be challenged, at least not in the medium term.
Officials have sought to assure Telekom investors that massive investments
made in upgrading the domestic network will not be jeopardised.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applications for the public offer of shares in Goldsborough Healthcare were
still being counted last night but it seemed the offer would not be much
oversubscribed.
The flotation valued the group at Pounds 74.5m, with 83.6 per cent of the
shares being sold.
Of these, 65 per cent were placed with institutions and the remaining 35 per
cent, 12.8m shares worth Pounds 21.8m at the 170p offer price, were
available to the public.
Some analysts felt the pricing was too high, and the fall in the stock
market affected interest in the shares.
The float enabled Kunick, the leisure group, to sell its 50 per cent stake,
and allowed NatWest Ventures to realise some of its investment.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Savoy to sell its Lancaster hotel in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Savoy group is looking for a buyer for the Lancaster hotel in Paris.
The group is believed to have asked London estate agents DE &amp; J. Levy to
sound out prospective buyers of the hotel, which is on the rue de Berri,
just off the Champs-Elysees.
The Lancaster is believed to have been trading reasonably well, but has been
hit by the downturn in the French economy.
Savoy is thought to have decided it would like to concentrate on its UK
interests and will sell the Paris hotel if it can get what it regards as the
right price.
Savoy, which also owns the Savoy, Berkeley and Claridge's in London and the
Lygon Arms in Worcestershire, recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.75m in the
six months to June 30 last year.
The Lancaster, which has 60 rooms, was originally built in 1899 as a family
home.
It was purchased in 1925 by Mr Emile Wolf who converted it into a hotel.
With an eye to the English market, he named it the Lancaster.
Mr Wolf filled the Lancaster's rooms with 18th century furniture, clocks,
tapestries and works of art.
The hotel was a favourite of Noel Coward, Greta Garbo and Clark Gable.
Mr Wolf sold the hotel to Savoy in 1970, saying he felt its character would
be safe in the group's hands.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Regent Inns plans expansion of pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regent Inns yesterday announced plans to expand its pub operations by a
third following a sharp increase in half-year profits.
Regent, a former business expansion scheme company which came to the market
last year, said its strategy had been underpinned by a 70 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 604,000) in the six months to
January 1 this year.
Mr Chris Watson, finance director, said: 'Our aim is now to open 12 new pubs
a year, and the size of the portfolio should increase from 33 to 44 by June
this year.'
The group, which raised Pounds 6.16m in a share placing and open offer last
April, said the current expansion programme would cost Pounds 6.8m in total.
Further acquisitions, designed to secure 80 outlets for the group over the
next five years, would be funded from an unused Pounds 7m bank loan facility
and existing cashflow.
Although the half-year figures were boosted by a Pounds 41,000 gain on the
disposal of fixed assets, the increase was mainly because of better trading
conditions at its sites in London and the home counties.
Mr Watson said that average turnover per pub was now 14 per cent higher than
a year ago.
This resulted in increased turnover of Pounds 7.16m, against Pounds 6.48m.
Earnings per share came out at 5.8p (5p).
Mr Watson said the interim dividend of 1.75p (2.25p) represented a third of
the anticipated annual total.
It was in line with company policy to pay such amounts progressively.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Eleco benefits from restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleco Holdings, the Hertfordshire-based building products and specialist
contracting group, returned to the black at the interim stage as its
restructuring programme began to bear fruit.
On turnover of Pounds 27m (Pounds 23.6m), including a contribution of Pounds
45,000 (Pounds 828,000) from discontinued activities, profits before tax for
the half year to December 31 emerged at Pounds 139,000 (losses of Pounds
2.21m).
Mr Field Walton, chairman, stressed that although some group businesses had
made good progress, particularly in the specialist products division, others
continued to encounter difficulties.
An improved showing from distribution and construction activities, currently
operating in 'highly competitive' markets, would only be achieved following
continuation of rationalisation programmes, Mr Walton said.
Borrowings stood at Pounds 8.9m at the period end, down from Pounds 11.9m at
June 30. Proceeds from disposals following the continuing withdrawal from
property development would be used to further reduce debt.
Earnings per share were 0.4p, against losses last time of 7.5p. There is
again no interim dividend, but a decision on a final will be made 'in light
of the full-year results and the continuing trading outlook'. The last
distribution was a final of 1p in 1992.

proceedings had commenced in the High Court by the liquidator of a private
property company in which they were individually named as defendants.
The directors concerned 'wholly refute the claims made against them', and
are contesting the proceedings vigorously, the company said.
Mr Redmayne stressed that Moorfield Estates was not involved in the
proceedings.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (3): Hub of
south-east Asia - Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The modern story of Singapore telecommunications revolves round Singapore
Telecom (ST), the island republic's telecommunications and post utility. ST
has an exclusive licence to provide local and international
telecommunications for Singapore until 2007 and a similar licence governing
mobile communications services running until 1997.
Partially privatised in October last year, ST is Singapore's biggest listed
company with a market capitalisation of more than SDollars 50bn (Dollars
32bn) - about 20 per cent of the local market's total capitalisation.
But in spite of its size and its monopoly position in Singapore, ST has
earned a reputation as an efficient and progressive telecommunications
facility. With about 40 lines per 100 people, Singapore has one of the
highest telephone penetration ratios in the east Asia region.
Singapore has become the telecommunications hub of south-east Asia. ST is
now determined to become not only a regional but a world participant in the
industry.
To date, ST has concentrated its efforts on the home market, putting in
place a wide range of services using state of the art technology. In 1989,
Singapore became the first country in the world to install a nationwide ISDN
network. With more than 50,000km of optical fibre cables installed
throughout the island, Singapore now has one of the highest urban
concentrations of optical fibre cable in the world.
Through its control of what the government refers to as 'basic services' ST
is the sole provider of fixed line national and international calls, public
cellular services, radio paging and, through a subsidiary company, mail
services.
But notwithstanding these advantages, ST has remained competitive and has
matured into a company capable of posing a challenge to much bigger global
participants.
In 1994, ST expects to spend SDollars 650m on improving its services and
installing the latest technology. Over the next five years ST says it will
be investing SDollars 3.7bn - big projects include the extension of
submarine cable networks and a new satellite earth station to supplement two
existing stations.
Despite such expenditures, ST boasts some of the lowest domestic and
international call charges in the region. It also has a range of services
the envy of many bigger telecommunications companies.
In 1990, ST launched what was the world's most advanced photo-video-text
system through which photographic quality images are transmitted via TV.
Users have access to a total of 130,000 teleview pages of government,
business and other other information.
Among other items users can pay bills, order goods and services, check banks
accounts, monitor stock prices, take part in school lessons - even calculate
income tax - through the system.
In the five years to March 31 1993 the number of international calls grew at
a rate of 18.7 per cent per year and the international sector now
contributes about 50 per cent of ST's revenues. Most analysts expect such
growth to be sustained in the medium term due to the continued growth in the
economy of Singapore and other countries in the region.
Cellular services are the main growth area at present - four in every 100 of
Singapore's population now has a mobile phone.
The emphasis now is on developing international operations. Through its
subsidiary, Singapore Telecom International, ST has been aggressively
expanding overseas, searching out joint ventures with a wide variety of
companies.
Until last October ST had invested nearly SDollars 500m in its overseas
operations. These include the provision of cable services in Britain, the
supply of data services in Thailand, cellular services in Vietnam, Sri Lanka
and the Philippines and paging services in Indonesia and Hong Kong.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (4): State
agencies fight for business - Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent surge in demand for telecommunications services in Thailand has
overwhelmed the old-fashioned state agencies which control the networks,
forcing them to concede an increasing share of new telecommunications
business to the private sector.
But the state agencies are not giving up without a fight, and they are
extracting a heavy price from concessionaires - who quickly pass on the cost
to the long-suffering consumers of Thailand - for every inch of
telecommunications territory they yield to a private contractor.
Against a background of Thai economic growth of around 8 per cent a year,
the Communications Authority of Thailand (Cat) and the Telephone
Organisation of Thailand (Tot) are notorious for their failure to keep pace
with the demand for telephone services.
By tradition, the Cat, which has monopoly control of international services,
used to be the fiefdom of the air force. The Tot, which runs the domestic
network, was dominated by the army. Over the years, however, the influence
of the armed forces in Thai politics has declined, and in 1992 the former
government of Mr Anand Panyarachun removed several military officers from
the boardrooms of state agencies such as the Cat.
Government officials and others are now discussing the possibility of fully
privatising the Cat and the Tot, opening the arena to competing companies,
and appointing a neutral regulator. The Tot has already appointed
consultants to examine its own privatisation.
Meanwhile, the waters have been muddied by a round of quasi-privatisations,
in the form of concessions to private operators granted by the two state
bodies, for activities ranging from mobile telephone operations to satellite
launching. There is no doubting the need for more telephone lines and
telecommunications services. Today Thailand has about 2.5m lines, half the
estimated demand. In Thailand there are about four lines per 100 people,
less than half the figure for neighbouring Malaysia and a tenth of the level
in Singapore.
The concession agreements have promoted the rapid growth of Thai
telecommunications companies such as TelecomAsia, the subsidiary of the
multinational Charoen Pokphand group, and the Shinawatra group of Mr Thaksin
Shinawatra, a former police colonel.
But the concession contracts are often controversial. The Anand government
even withdrew 1m lines from the 3m-line installation contract awarded to
TelecomAsia and gave them to another consortium, on the grounds that the
original deal was too lucrative for Tele-comAsia and deprived the government
of revenue.
International telephone calls out of Thailand are among the most expensive
in the world, an anomaly for a country which insists that it wants to become
a regional communications hub. British Telecommunications has finally
installed a data packet-switching node in Bangkok under a joint venture
agreement with the Cat, but the charges levied by the Cat are believed to be
exceptionally onerous by international standards.
Tot staff have been slow to connect the lines built by TelecomAsia, a
problem Telecom-Asia has sought to overcome by offering Tot employees
inducements in the form of shares at a steep discount to their market value.
Full privatisation of telecommunications in Thailand is likely to be
hindered not only by vested interests in the Cat and the Tot, but also by
some of the private concessionaires themselves when they benefit from
'exclusivity' clauses allowing them sole rights to a particular network or
type of operation for a fixed number of years.
For example, Shinawatra, which launched Thailand's first satellite in
December last year, was granted a 30-year monopoly on serving local
satellite users when it won the contract in 1990, although the Anand
government subsequently reduced the monopoly period to eight years.
Foreign equipment suppliers which have cosy arrangements with the Cat and
Tot might also resist liberalisation. Some international telecommunications
companies, on the other hand, would welcome a change in the laws which grant
the Cat and the Tot monopoly ownership of the networks.
The Cat and the Tot, surrounded by dynamic local private sector companies
and their foreign partners, are beginning to look out of their depth in an
age when telecommunications, broadcasting and the computer business are
converging.
TelecomAsia, in which Nynex of the US has a 15 per cent stake, wants to
increase the value of its contract to install 2m telephone lines in Bangkok
by using fibre-optic cables to transmit cable television as well as
telephone calls.
This did not form part of the original contract, but the Tot, perhaps
persuaded by the offer of cheap shares, appears to have accepted it as a
fait accompli.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (2): World waits
for reforms - India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government is putting the final touches to a new
telecommunications policy which it hopes will pave the way to large-scale
private investment and end the state's monopoly of the industry.
Foreign companies are among the many groups which hope to take advantage of
the reforms once they come into force and have been busy lobbying for
change. But in framing the policies ministers have also to take into account
the opposition of most of the 470,000 workers employed by the government's
department of telecommunications, who fear their jobs might be lost if the
market is opened to competition.
The improvement of India's telecommunications network is a prerequisite for
the success of the government's policy of opening India to international
trade and investment. India has about eight telephones per 1,000 people,
compared with a global average of 100.
India has about 7m telephones. Just to provide an average of one line for
every 10 of its 200m middle-class people would mean installing an extra 13m
lines - an investment of the order of USDollars 13bn, according to officials
of the government's department of telecommunications. Mr N Vittal, the
dynamic chairman of the Telecommunications Commission, the industry's
policy-making body, believes that without private sector investors,
including foreign companies, India cannot raise the funds it needs for
telecommunications. And without better telecommunications, India 'cannot
plug into the global market'.
In an effort to improve the efficiency of the network, the services for
Delhi and Bombay were split from the department of telecommunications in
1986 and made into a separate state-owned company called Mahangar Telephone
Nigam Ltd. But the frictions between this and the department - over pay
rates, for example - were so great that in 1991, the government ordered a
review by the Athreya Committee, which in the same year recommended
splitting the network into four regional corporations and one for
long-distance services. (A separate corporation Videsh Sangam Nagar Ltd or
VSNL handles international calls.)
The telecommunications trade unions protested strongly at the suggested
break-up of the network, principally out of fear that the loss-making
operations covering depressed eastern India would have no choice but to cut
staff. The unions orchestrated political support so effectively that the
planned reorganisation of the network has repeatedly been delayed - and with
it the rules under which private companies are to be allowed into
telecommunications.
Mr Vittal, a high-flying civil servant who took over at the
telecommunications commission last autumn, has argued in favour of extensive
liberalisation to promote the growth of efficiency and to open the door to
investment. His target is to have 20m lines installed by 2000 - an aim that
is only feasible with large-scale private investment.
However, the latest indications are that the government is unlikely to order
the network's break-up and may instead turn the telecommunications
department into one state-owned corporation. There would still be plenty of
scope for the entry of private capital but preserving the public network
inside one corporation would shield it from the full blast of competition.
As Mr Vittal said in a speech late last year: 'One has to make a distinction
between liberalisation and privatisation. At the moment our emphasis is on
liberalisation.'
It seems likely that the government will also continue to distinguish
between the basic network of telephone services, in which the influence of
the trade unions is strongest, and new added-value services including
computer-linked services, cellular telephone networks and paging services.
In the basic services, a strong hint of the conditions under which private
investment will be permitted are indicated by the terms on which US West, a
US telecommunications company, last year won approval from the Cabinet
Committee on Foreign Investment for a USDollars 100m joint venture providing
services to an industrial town in Tamil Nadu in partnership with the
state-owned Tamil Nadu Electronic Development Corporation.
The partners, which plan to invest a total of USDollars 1bn over 10 years in
different locations, will have a non-exclusive licence and will therefore be
obliged to compete with the department of telecommunication and with other
possible carriers. The partners will also be required to charge the same as
existing DoT rates and to connect their systems with the DoT network.
However, the US West project still requires separate approval from the
telecommunications ministry. Other foreign companies which are among 18
groups that have expressed interest in investing in basic telephone services
include Qualcomm and Media Digital of the US and Northern Telecom, from
Canada. The potential bidders also number leading Indian industrial groups
including Calcutta-based RP Goenka group and YK Modi of Delhi.
In the meantime, the government has tried to promote the expansion of
added-value services, particularly cellular telephones and paging services,
but its efforts have been stymied by clumsy handling of bids resulting in
legal action.
For paging services, the government last month gave an initial go-ahead to
16 companies, all joint ventures between Indian and foreign groups, to
operate radio-paging services in 27 cities. The announcement came a year
after the Delhi High Court over-ruled objections from some unsuccessful
bidders.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bass establishes joint venture with Grolsch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass, the UK's largest brewer, said yesterday it was forming a joint venture
company to market and distribute Grolsch lager in Britain and Ireland.
Under an agreement with the Dutch brewer, Bass will also have the exclusive
licence to brew the lager at its plant at Alton, Hampshire.
The decision is a departure for the Enschede-based company, which until now
has never allowed its beer to be brewed anywhere other than in its own
breweries in the Netherlands.
Grolsch said it was changing its policy because it wanted to capitalise on
the strength of its brand in the UK, particularly in southern England where
premium brands account for 47 per cent of lager sales.
Brewing in the UK had also become a more attractive option following the
1992 sterling devaluation and the growing strength of the guilder, the
company added.
Bass's production, which will cover casks, cans and bottles but not
Grolsch's trademark swing-top bottle, is expected to begin later this year.
Mr Jerry Fowden, chief executive of Bass Brewers, said the creation of the
joint venture company - to be named Grolsch (UK) - did not involve a
material investment by either the UK or Dutch backers.
Bass will hold 49 per cent of the new company. 'We hope to double Grolsch
sales to around 200,000 barrels a year,' he added.
The agreement gives Bass the right to not only to distribute UK-brewed lager
to its own pubs and hotels, but to a national network of 27,000 on-trade
outlets and the off-licence industry.
Grolsch also said it could not rule out the possibility that it would
conclude similar types of arrangements in other markets, but declined to
give details. The company's second-biggest export market after the UK is the
US.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BT plans focus on global ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications has restructured its senior management team to
give a sharper focus to its international ambitions.
BT's business division has been split into two, one for international
business, the other for national business.
Mr Alfred Mockett, the current director of business communications, will
head the new international division.
Mr Mockett will also take one of the BT seats on the board of MCI, the long-
distance US carrier in which BT took a 20 per cent stake for Dollars 5.3bn
(Pounds 3.63bn) last June.
Mr Bruce Bond, currently director of BT's product and services management
division, will lead the new national business division.
Mr Stafford Taylor - the former head of Cellnet, BT's cellular mobile joint
venture with Securicor - will continue to head BT's personal communications
division, which covers the residential market.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, said the new international
division would develop BT's marketing, services and sales capabilities for
multinational companies needing global services, a field where BT is likely
to be in strong competition with AT&amp;T of the US.
BT and MCI are establishing a Dollars 1bn joint venture company to serve the
global market. It is expected to be launched within the next few months as
soon as regulatory approval is secured in Washington.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources Dollars 0.38m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first set of results since reconstruction proposals were put to
shareholders last June, Alliance Resources, the oil and gas exploration and
production company, reported pre-tax losses of Dollars 381,000 (Pounds
261,000) for the six months to October 31. For the year to April 30 1993
there were losses of Dollars 1.63m.
The reduced deficit reflected a cut in administrative expenses to Dollars
407,000 (Dollars 1.54m for 12 months), a fall in net interest costs to
Dollars 62,000 (Dollars 198,000) and a small increase in production.
Turnover was Dollars 461,000 (Dollars 631,000). Losses per share were 0.01p
(0.09p).
The June proposals comprised the acquisition of Manx Petroleum, the
acquisition of a further 14.25 per cent in the Valentine field, a Pounds
2.8m rights issue and placing together with a capital reconstruction and the
appointment of two non-executive directors, Mr James Prior as chairman and
Lord Torrington.
In addition, the company's listing was restored in July and the
reorganisation plan for its Alliance Resources (USA) subsidiary was approved
by the US Bankruptcy Court.
Mr Prior said the changes did not have a material effect on the results.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: CEGF placing oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The institutional placing for the Central European Growth Fund, an
investment trust to be managed by CS First Boston, was oversubscribed at
Dollars 150m (Pounds 103m). Up to Dollars 50m more is expected to be raised
from the public offer, which opens today.
The fund, which although dollar denominated will have a London quote, will
invest in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, with up to 20 per cent
elsewhere in central Europe.
The main focus will be on small to medium-sized companies (Dollars 20m to
Dollars 300m capitalisation) listed on the Prague, Warsaw and Budapest stock
exchanges, but a proportion will also be invested in companies expected to
gain a listing within two years.
Mr Charles Harman, of CS First Boston, described these economies as 'not so
much emerging markets as re-emerging markets' with a strong industrial
tradition and low wage costs.
CS First Boston has been active in the region for several years, including
managing Dollars 750m of funds for local clients.
Investment of money raised through the issue will take place gradually over
the next six to 12 months, to avoid pushing up share prices with a flood of
new money. This will also allow the fund to take advantage of privatisations
expected in the near future.
Ordinary shares are offered at Dollars 1, with one warrant attached to every
five shares. The impact of issue expenses will mean that ordinary shares
will have an initial net asset value of 96.2 cents.
The public offer closes on March 11, and dealings in the shares and warrants
is expected to start on March 21.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers sets float price at 153p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Carriers, the parcels and freight distribution company, finalised its
flotation details yesterday, pricing the shares at 153p to produce a market
capitalisation of Pounds 51.8m.
Net proceeds to the company will be Pounds 6m, which will be used initially
to reduce borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet, cutting gearing from
42.5 per cent at the year end to between 15 per cent and 25 per cent.
Mr Allan Binks, chairman, said that, with the continuing recovery in the UK
economy, the group would now be 'well placed to take advantage of its
potential for profitable growth in the future.'
Just over 15m ordinary shares, worth Pounds 23m, are being placed with
institutions. The biggest seller is Phildrew Ventures, which in 1989 backed
the management in a Pounds 55m buy-out from Bunzl, now a paper and packing
company but then a conglomerate. Bunzl is selling its remaining 8 per cent
stake.
After the buy-out institutions will hold 68 per cent of the group.
Directors, who held 31 per cent, will have 18 per cent. The remaining 14 per
cent will be held by employees and former employees.
The company's prospectus shows that operating profits on continuing
operations before exceptionals rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.3m in the
year to December 31. Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds
93m to Pounds 106.4m.
The notional net dividend for 1993 is 4.9p, giving a notional gross dividend
yield of 4 per cent.
The placing is sponsored by Lazard Brothers and brokers are UBS.
Dealings are expected to commence next Thursday.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bid for STC Submarine cleared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has cleared the Pounds 600m bid for
STC Submarine Systems by Alcatel Alsthom, the French communications
equipment supplier.
Alcatel's purchase of the UK submarine systems supplier from Northern
Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier which bought STC
in 1990, is expected to be finalised soon.
The sale makes Alcatel Europe's only large telecommunications submarine
systems supplier. Its main competitors are AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
company, and Fujitsu and NEC, the Japanese suppliers.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chief executive, said the merger of the two
businesses 'will allow the European industry to confront world competition
with maximum advantage'.
He cited, in particular, competition for the Flag project - fibre optic
links around the globe - the largest network of undersea cables ever
tendered, where Alcatel would be in strong competition with the US and
Japanese suppliers.
Contracts are likely to be awarded later this year.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Woolwich advances 46% to Pounds 217m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Woolwich building society yesterday announced a 46 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 149m to Pounds 217m in the year to December 31,
due to lower provisions for bad and doubtful debts and improved performances
from its 11 operating subsidiaries.
Pre-tax profits for the society itself, the UK's third largest, were Pounds
226m (Pounds 177m).
The society said the overall provisions for the group were Pounds 143m
(Pounds 183m), of which the charge for loan losses was Pounds 123m (Pounds
145m).
The number of homes in possession almost halved during the year from 3,453
to 1,806.
Gross mortgage lending by the society rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 2.86bn
(Pounds 2.54bn), but net lending fell back slightly to Pounds 972m (Pounds
978m).
Total assets grew by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 25bn.
Despite the intense competition for savings, the society's net retail
receipts rose to Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 893m) and it had an 18.5 per cent
share of the building society savings market.
Only three subsidiaries incurred a loss in 1993. These were: Banque
Woolwich, the French mortgage-lending subsidiary; Woolwich SpA, the
Milan-based wholesale funded mortgage lending company; and Woolwich property
services, the estate agency, which trimmed its losses to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds
11m). Overall pre-tax losses from the subsidiaries fell to Pounds 9m (Pounds
27m).
Mr Donald Kirkham, group chief executive, said he expected the estate agency
to move into profit this year, and both the European subsidiaries to be in
profit by the end of 1995.
Cost/income ratio for the group fell to 49.3 per cent (52.9 per cent).
During 1993, Woolwich issued a further Pounds 175m subordinated debt, which
contributed to a year-end result of wholesale funds up slightly at 23 per
cent (22 per cent) of total share, deposit and loan liabilities - still well
below the regulatory limit of 40 per cent.
Mr Kirkham said he expected a 'substantial volume of pent-up demand' to be
released this year, leading to a rise in the number of property transactions
to 1.4m (1.2m), and a 5 per cent increase in house prices by the end of the
year.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said the results were
'impressive and robust.'
Though the fall in provisions was less steep than that reported by some
other large societies, this reflected the fact that in 1992 Woolwich had had
a lower than average provision charge on assets.

<TEXT>
Wheelock, the trading conglomerate formerly known as World International,
has teamed up with Virgin Retail in a bid to bring Virgin Megastores to the
colony and, later, to China and Taiwan.
Virgin Megastores (Hong Kong), the joint venture company, will be equally
owned by Wheelock Pacific and Virgin Retail.
In line with other Virgin Megastores throughout the world the store will
bring together experience of the local retail market with Virgin's home
entertainment retail concept.
Potential sites - which include developments in the Wheelock land bank  -
are already under consideration, and it is expected the first joint venture
megastore will open early next year at the latest.
Wheelock said the move was in line with its plans to form alliances with
large international groups as part of its strategy to broaden its business
base, especially in the east Asia, Hong Kong and China regions.
Mr Will Whitehorn of Virgin, said plans to tap into the growing home
entertainment market in China were complicated by the Chinese government's
attitude towards intellectual property rights protection.
Ms Lee Sands, the US trade representative's director for China, has urged
the Beijing authorities to clamp down on intellectual property rights
infringements - a long-running source of friction between the two countries.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (1): Lined up for
development - In a region where telecommunications services range from the
primitive to the sophisticated, opportunities for newcomers are legion.
Andrew Adonis discusses the problems and highlights the areas where new
operators and investors can make a contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metternich's famous quip that Italy was a geographical expression applies
more justly to the Asia-Pacific region. Societies as diverse as New Zealand,
the Philippines and China have barely one thing in common: a situation on
the same side of the globe.
Telecommunications may be helping, gently, to integrate the region, but its
diversity is reflected in the existing state of the industry. As the graphs
make clear, all stages of telecommunications development are to be found in
the region.
Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong have a 'teledensity' - a ratio
of main lines to population - on a par with the rest of the developed world.
Singapore is not far behind, and South Korea has a teledensity just behind
that of Spain. By contrast, most of the region's emerging market countries
have primitive networks, with fewer than 10 lines per 100 people. A swathe
of low-income countries have no national networks worth the name, and
provide telephones for fewer than one in 100 of their citizens. Therefore
when American or European investors or operators talk glibly of 'moving into
Asia-Pacific telecoms', all it tells you of their strategy is that they want
to do something abroad.
The opportunities to do something are legion. In the region's high-income
countries, liberalisation and privatisation have caught on more strongly
than in the European Union. Australia, New Zealand and Japan all have
competing cellular and fixed-wire operators. Hong Kong's domestic monopoly
will be broken next year: the British colony already has four cellular
operators, three of them with two networks apiece, plus some 15 paging
operators. New Zealand has sold 49 per cent of its state telecoms operator
to Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, the US regional Bell companies, and now has
arguably the world's most open telecoms market.
In medium- and low-income countries, the role telecoms modernisation can
play in underpinning economic growth is widely appreciated. Almost
everywhere, there is a new readiness to look beyond the traditional monopoly
operators, even if that means legal reforms and domestic controversy.
As a recent World Bank discussion paper* puts it: 'It is generally agreed
that the limited attention accorded telecommunications in the past and the
prevalence of state-run monopolies has cost Asia's poorer countries dearly,
economically and socially'. More than 2.8bn people in the region's
low-income countries have access to barely 25m telephone lines.
The priority, argues the World Bank paper, is not so much privatisation but
the licensing of new operators and the creation of an investment and
regulatory environment which is congenial to them. 'By and large,' it
advises, 'governments should adopt a 'serve it or lose it' policy to require
carriers to meet the paid demand for new service within a given time or face
the prospect of (a) having a competing company licensed to provide service,
or (b) having portions of their service territory refranchised to other
carriers.'
On that basis, barriers to competition would tumble across the region.
Waiting lists and investment patterns are such that in at least half of the
poorer countries it would take until past 2000 to satisfy existing demand
for new telephone lines if expansion continues on recent trends. And waiting
lists expose only a fraction of suppressed demand and growth potential.
China is the world's most breathtaking telecommunications opportunity. Its
government has a target of providing at least 40m new lines by 2000,
offering manufacturers and operators the prospect of installing from scratch
a network equal to that of two British Telecommunications.
Western equipment manufacturers already do brisk business in China. Alcatel,
the French manufacturer, is the leader, with about 30 per cent of the market
and significant production facilities. Germany's Siemens and Japan's NEC
have notable stakes; America's AT&amp;T is eyeing opportunities seriously.
The coming months will be critical for the evolution of liberalisation in
the low- and medium-income countries. Fierce debate is taking place within
different tiers of China's government about allowing overseas operators to
build and operate networks. Mr Huang Ju, Shanghai's reformist mayor, said
last year that he wanted to license western operators to expand Shanghai's
telecommunications. The idea received a frosty response from Beijing's
hidebound ministry of posts and telecommunications, which is also battling
with other ministries anxious to see alternative providers. But most
analysts see liberalisation as inevitable if the government is serious about
meeting its targets.
Crucial decisions are also soon to be taken in India and Indonesia. The
Indian government is selling a stake in VSNL, India's international
operator, to international institutions. Once complete, about a third of the
company will be in non-government hands. The country's forward-looking
telecoms commission has proposed that the domestic sector should be
liberalised further: one option is for domestic telecoms operations to be
split into four separate companies and privatised, with other operators
licensed to build lines and provide services.
The Indian government has received more than 30 proposals from non-state
operators to provide services, worth between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn
between them. US West, Singapore Telecom and Telecom New Zealand are among
the overseas companies in the frame. US West is proposing a Dollars 100m
joint venture to provide services to an industrial town in Tamil Nadu in
partnership with state-owned Tamil Nadu Electronic Development Corporation.
In Indonesia, which has barely 0.7 lines per 100 people, partial
privatisation of the state operator is under serious consideration, along
with liberalisation to allow private sector involvement in some form.
The models for many are Thailand, which has pioneered 'build, operate,
transfer' contracts, and Malaysia, which four years ago sold a 25 per cent
stake in its state operator on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange and is now
considering pressing ahead with competition in all markets. 'There is over
Dollars 2bn of international public offerings (IPOs) already in the pipeline
in the region, excluding Japan,' says Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia-Pacific
telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong. 'There were two listed
companies outside Japan in 1990. Now there are 30; by the end of this year
there will be 40; and by the end of 1996 there will be at least 50. In the
three years to the end of 1996, IPOs worth at least Dollars 15bn are likely
to be forthcoming. It's a huge potential market.'
It is also a prime test bed for new technology, and applications tailored to
developing markets with low line penetration. If it secures its Indian
licence, US West intends to use cellular networks as a means of providing a
local service rapidly to middle-class districts where demand is highest,
rolling out a service in advance of the fixed-wire network. Paging and
telepoint services have taken off in the region: in Hong Kong, pagers are as
much fashion accessories as a means of communication.
Several operators are exploring the possibility of using radio-based
networks for fixed-phones, to accelerate roll-out and avoid laying expensive
fibre and cable in the local loop and rural areas. Extensive installation of
payphones is also an attractive business option, a market well served by
manufacturers including the UK's GPT.
However, for any liberalisation to be successful, effective regulation is
essential. Issues of inter-connection, standards, pricing and even bribery,
bedevil all attempts at telecoms liberalisation in developing countries.
Divesting the state operator of responsibility for detailed rule-making is
not a sufficient reform, but it is absolutely necessary if better service is
the object. As the World Bank stresses, 'regulation has been the weakest
part of sector reform in poorer countries. If this deficiency is not
addressed, ambitious plans for sectoral expansion are likely to be
compromised'.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Strong end to year as Telegraph rises 36%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong final quarter helped The Telegraph lift 1993 pre-tax profits 36 per
cent from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 60.2m. Excluding one-off items, pre-tax
profits were 15.5 per cent higher at Pounds 53.7m.
A final dividend of 7.5p is proposed to give a total of 13p (11p), a rise of
18 per cent.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director, said that the trend of stronger advertising
revenue had continued into the current year. The shares rose 7p to 587p,
compared with the flotation price of 325p in July 1992.
The group, which publishes the Daily and Sunday Telegraph in the UK, also
has a 25 per cent stake in John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper
group, and a 9.4 per cent stake in Southam, the Canadian publisher. Nearly
20 per cent of pre-tax profit comes from outside the UK, Mr Conrad Black,
chairman, said.
During 1993, newspaper advertising revenue rose 8 per cent while circulation
revenue increased by almost 6 per cent. Mr Cooke said that the price of the
Monday to Friday Daily Telegraph had been increased in February last year,
but the Saturday and Sunday papers prices had not risen in the autumn as was
usual. The Saturday edition's price was 'the next candidate' for an
increase, he said.
About 53 per cent of revenue came from advertising, a recovery from recent
years, but well below the two thirds contributed in the peak year of 1989.
Group turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 255.7m (Pounds 237.2m) for
operating profits up from Pounds 37.5m, after Pounds 2.2m of float costs, to
Pounds 42.9m.
The sale of a stake in Trinity International Holdings in February
contributed a profit of Pounds 6.5m.
Associates more than doubled to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 5.9m) largely because
of the increase in the Fairfax stake.
There was a Pounds 2.8m worsening in the interest position, as a credit of
Pounds 900,000 turned to a debit of Pounds 1.9m. During 1993 The Telegraph
increased its stake in Fairfax from 15 per cent, at a cost of Pounds 74m and
acquired the Southam stake for Pounds 66m. As a result total borrowings rose
from Pounds 40.5m to Pounds 104m. However, taking account of cash of Pounds
9.5m, gearing at the year end was 31 per cent.
The tax rate rose to 30.9 per cent (27.5 per cent). Earnings per share were
higher at 30.6p (23.8p) or 27.4p (23.8p), excluding the investment profit.
COMMENT
The cycle is beginning to work in The Telegraph's favour and 1994 should see
further good growth in advertising. Meanwhile, Fairfax is proving a good
investment, though the cycle there is perhaps two years behind that in the
UK. Later on the Southam stake should also contribute as it also responds to
the cost-cutting. With profits this year expected to rise to about Pounds
65m, the prospective p/e is about 17. Suspicions over the 68 per cent stake
held by Mr Black's Hollinger group seem to have been dispelled and the
shares could continue to outperform.

Provident Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.5m for 1993, a 54 per cent increase
over the previous year's restated Pounds 40.7m.
Earnings per share rose by 47 per cent to 31.43p and a recommended 46 per
cent rise in the final dividend to 11.25p makes a 16p (11.4p) total.
Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said profitability had benefited from
the steps taken over the last couple of years to rationalise the group's
operations by reorganising the continuing businesses and disposing of
underperforming subsidiaries.
Borrowings fell from Pounds 228m at the start of 1993 to Pounds 187m at the
year-end, reflecting partly the receipt of Pounds 30m from the sale of
Bradford-based Peoples Bank and the business of Peoples Motor Finance.
The group has reduced its offices to 267 (360) and cut the number of its
employees from 4,100 to 3,500.
Its self-employed sales force who act as agents in the home collecting
credit operation, the main business, has also dropped in size slightly.
It offers unsecured loans, mostly to tenants on council estates, on which it
charges high rates of interest to compensate for collection costs and risk.
Pre-tax profits for the home collected credit division increased by 29 per
cent to Pounds 58.1m. Bad debt charges were broadly the same as in 1992,
after two years in which they increased. However, because credit issued and
collected rose by 7 per cent the charges fell as a proportion of total
credit.
The group is 'hoping, but not expecting', that charges for bad debts might
go down in 1994.
The insurance division doubled its pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.8m. The main
growth in the underwriting business came from Halifax Insurance, which
increased its policyholder numbers to 618,000 (400,000) at the year-end
Mr van Kuffeler said motor premiums levelled off in the last quarter of
1993, after nine months of strong growth. He did not expect similarly strong
growth in 1994.
Halifax Insurance also benefited from a payment from Halifax building
society for purchasing its trademarks, and is now being renamed Provident
Insurance.
A Pounds 2m restructuring provision was made to cover the setting up of a
pilot telephone sales operation as part of Colonnade Insurance brokers,
where trading profits rose from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 900,000. The
company has lost customers to direct writers, and the group is rationalising
its activities. About 20 of its 120 branches are expected to close during
the year.
Provident's shares closed 10p lower at 499p.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Towry Law at Pounds 565,000 after listing
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towry Law, the chain of independent financial advisers which floated last
November, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 565,000 for the six months to
December 31 after meeting the Pounds 237,000 costs of listing.
The comparable figure for 1992 was Pounds 42,000.
Turnover rose to Pounds 10.9m, an improvement of 29 per cent over last
time's Pounds 8.44m.
Mr Cecil Law, chairman, said that as trading last year was 'difficult' in
the first half and strong in the second six months, the increase in the
current second half was unlikely to be as large.
An interim dividend of 1.5p is declared from earnings of 1.9p (0.2p).
The financial services industry is currently the subject of an investigation
into faulty advice on pension transfers. Independent financial advisers have
been among those criticised, but Towry Law said it had not advised on any
transfers involving opt-outs from final salary schemes, and its involvement
generally in transfers from public sector schemes was minor.
Pensions advisory activities are responsible for the smallest proportion of
turnover of the company's three divisions, after financial planning and
insurance broking.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Beazer Homes to raise Pounds 50m of new
money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beazer Homes is to raise Pounds 50m of new money when it is floated by
Hanson next month. Before the new money, Beazer will have no debt.
The new funds would finance land purchases and working capital to take
Beazer Homes a long way towards its target of building 7,000 houses a year
by the end of the decade, the group said.
In its pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday, Beazer Homes said that had
it been quoted for a full year to June 1994 it would have paid a dividend of
5.4p, a rise of 8 per cent over an indicated 5p pay-out for 1993.
The 1993 dividend would have been covered 2.3 times by adjusted earnings of
11.4p, not taking account of the benefit of the Pounds 50m. Mr Victor
Benjamin, chairman, said he expected dividend cover to vary between two and
three depending on the stage of the housebuilding cycle.
The group said that during the first four months of the current financial
period, which will be for nine months, reservations were 33 per cent up and
completions 28 per cent up.
Mr Dennis Webb, chief executive, said the group was currently in late stages
of negotiating the purchase of 3,000 plots of land, at an average price of
Pounds 11,000. At the end of December the group's land bank was 16,117 plots
at an average price of Pounds 8,500.
He said he expected average selling prices to rise, partly as the group
changed its mix towards the higher end of the market, and also because the
levels of sales incentives were falling, from some Pounds 4,000 to Pounds
5,000 a house to about Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000 now.
The prospectus warned that because the group was currently developing higher
cost sites, gross margins would be reduced in the current year. This would
put some pressure on the operating margin which was 13.6 per cent in the
year to September, said Mr David Smith, finance director.
The group has about 4,000 plots bought between 1989 and 1991 when land costs
were higher. These would be used 'in the short term', Mr Webb said.
Mr Smith also warned that the tax charge would rise over the next three to
four years from 25 to 33 per cent.
Analysts said the amount of new money being raised was encouraging as Beazer
Homes would come to market with a strong balance sheet.
However, the fall in the stock market yesterday was also weighing on
forecasts of the group's likely market capitalisation which ranged up to
Pounds 450m.
Mr Webb said the 'ethos and structure' of the company was based on the
belief that a profitable housebuilder needs a good local knowledge of its
markets.
The group is divided into 14 autonomous companies, and there are few central
functions although there were strict central financial controls.
The subsidiaries are responsible for buying land, deciding what sort of
houses to build, for buying materials and marketing the finished product.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Development Securities back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development Securities, formerly Claythorn Properties, has returned to the
black after three years of heavy losses.
The company has undertaken a radical programme of asset sales in the last
two years, but since Mr Martin Landau took a significant shareholding and
joined the board last June, it has started to rebuild its investment
portfolio.
Pre-tax profits in 1993 amounted to Pounds 900,000, compared with losses of
Pounds 40.8m restated for FRS 3, but the figures were boosted by the release
of Pounds 5m of negative goodwill from the sale of Stead &amp; Simpson, the shoe
retailer.
Turnover fell to Pounds 26m (Pounds 71.4m).
The company raised Pounds 56.4m during the year through two placings and
open offers, and boosted its investment portfolio from Pounds 31.2m to
Pounds 80.2m.
It has become more positive about the property development market, and is to
start work on two sites, after several years of inactivity.
Mr Landau, deputy chairman, said the company had cleaned up its balance
sheet and was looking to expand through property investments, or by
acquisition.
Earnings per share amounted to 1.9p (107p losses).

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Underlying business remains stable - New
competitive culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday reported flat full-year operating profits on an
historical basis of Pounds 1.68bn before exceptional charges.
The figures showed that the underlying business was stable despite the
Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge taken by the company to fund its radical
restructuring.
The company was also able to make a fractional increase in its full year
dividend to 14.5 pence a share, compared with 14.2 pence last time.
Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, noted that the increased dividend was
'broadly in line with inflation.' The company still retained a policy of
making achieving real rises in dividends, he said.
Mr Rogerson noted that dividend cover was 1.4 times, compared with the
normal level of 1.5.
The loss per share after exceptional items was 6.6p, compared with a profit
per share of 15.8p in 1992. But the adjusted figure, excluding exceptional
charges, was 20.8p (21.8p).
Despite diversification in recent years the UK gas supply business still
provides the overwhelming bulk of British Gas operating profits. These were
Pounds 1.16bn before exceptional charges of Pounds 1.56bn, resulting in an
operating loss of Pounds 405m, compared with a Pounds 927m profit in 1992.
Overseas gas supply made an operating profit of Pounds 162m (Pounds 137m),
while exploration and production profits rose to Pounds 264m from Pounds
226m before.
The rise in the overseas division was attributable mainly to good results
from the company's distribution operations in Argentina, where it is part of
a consortium supplying gas to Buenos Aires.
British Gas's US trading arm, the Natural Gas Clearinghouse, also reported
improved operating profits.
The exploration and production side benefitted from new fields coming on
stream and higher production rates from the South Morecombe field off the
west coast of the UK.
Analysts expect a steady increase in exploration and production profits over
the next few years because of a planned rise in production volumes. Total
sales volume last year was 98.9m barrels of oil equivalent, but analysts say
it could rise to 150m barrels by 1995-1996.
British Gas also benefits from the fact that the pricing structure of many
of its gas supply contracts is linked only partially to oil prices, which
could stay weak for much of this year.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A competitive culture is promoted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A British Gas manager recently recalled the reaction of his elderly father
in the north of England upon being told that his son was being posted to the
company's exploration and production operations in Tunisia.
'What, you're going to Africa with the Gas Board?' the incredulous old man
asked.
That public sector and decidedly domestic image of British Gas has been
difficult to shake off in the eight years since privatisation, despite
glossy advertising campaigns extolling the company's growing international
role, with operations in dozens of countries.
Most British Gas customers, including the millions of 'Sids' who bought the
company's shares at its privatisation in 1986, probably still see the
company more as a dividend-paying public service than as a multinational
energy company. Unfortunately for senior management so too do many British
Gas workers and middle-ranking managers.
The internal resistance to changes brought on by increasing competition were
highlighted last year when independent gas trading companies complained to
Ofgas, the industry regulator, that the company was failing to provide
timely information on the sale of their gas sent through British Gas
pipelines.
It was later determined that inadequate information technology systems were
partly to blame for the lengthy delays. But it was also clear that some
employees saw little reason to help competitors, even if they were customers
as well.
Long-serving employees were steeped in a tradition summed up by one veteran
manager as 'British Gas knows best,' an inheritance from the days of Sir
Dennis Rooke, a former chairman.
Introducing a competitive culture among the remaining employees is a
priority for the company's senior executives. The announcement last December
of the end of British Gas's regional structure in favour of five new
national businesses was a big step forward, according to analysts. It meant
that powerful regional heads would lose their ability to block reforms
proposed by Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, and Mr Philip Rogerson,
finance director.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas, says the senior managers
have 'genuinely embraced competition,' if for no other reason than they want
to reduce the role of the regulator.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Compulsory job cuts not ruled out - 25,000
jobs to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas executives told union leaders yesterday that no guarantee could
be given that there would not be compulsory redundancies over the next five
years.
That followed news of an additional 5,000 job cuts to the 20,000 job losses
announced last November as part of the company's restructuring programme.
Union officials said, however, that there would be a serious prospect of
industrial action at British Gas if the company went ahead and tried to push
through compulsory job losses.
Mr Mick Skidmore, a GMB general union official for the gas industry, said
last night that the union believed British Gas could only expect to secure
around half the redundancies it wanted by voluntary means.
'With a cut as savage as around a third in the size of its labour force we
don't believe the company will be able to avoid compulsory redundancies', he
added.
Mr Skidmore said the unions were still waiting to be told by the company
where the job cuts announced last November would come from, although some
details at least of the broad sectors of the businesses affected were
promised within the next few days.
About 2,000 British Gas workers have volunteered so far to take voluntary
redundancy, union sources said.
Unison, the white-collar union, claimed last night that British Gas planned
to shed about 33,000 jobs by 1998 and not the 25,000 it had so far
announced.
Union officials said they had obtained internal documents from the company
that substantiated their claim.
These suggest, on the basis of jobs to be allocated to the company's new
business units, that its workforce will fall from 66,000 at present to just
32,000 in five years.
The documents indicate the numbers employed in service and installation will
drop from 22,200 this year to only 9,300 by 1998 while those in
transportation and storage will decline from 23,800 to 15,600 over the same
period.
Other cuts involve nearly halving the workforce in the public gas supply
unit from 11,100 to 5,700, a cut in retailing staff from 2,300 to 1,300 and
a two thirds reduction in numbers employed in contract gas from 975 to 350.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance back in the black at Pounds
143m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance, one of the UK's largest composite insurers, is back in the
black after three years of heavy losses.
The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 143m, against a deficit of
Pounds 27m last year and losses of nearly Pounds 600m since 1990.
A final dividend of 7.5p is proposed, compared with 5p in 1992 and a
forecast of 6.5p at the time of the rights issue last year.
Like Commercial Union and Guardian Royal Exchange, Royal's turnround hinged
on a marked improvement in trading conditions in the UK.
UK underwriting losses were reduced from Pounds 259m to Pounds 15m, with
most lines of business underwritten profitably.
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, singled out a particularly good
performance by The Insurance Service, the Bristol-based telephone motor
insurer, which increased its sales by 15 per cent, made profits of Pounds 5m
and now has 370,000 motor policyholders.
Royal increased its UK premium income to Pounds 1.62bn (Pounds 1.55bn), but
shed some market share in home and private motor insurance, where income
fell to Pounds 605m (Pounds 615m) and Pounds 231m (Pounds 239m)
respectively.
Profits in Canada fell slightly from Pounds 23m to Pounds 21m. The US also
showed a decline, from Pounds 24m to Pounds 15m, while other territories
edged ahead to Pounds 40m (Pounds 38m). Reserves to meet potential claims
stemming from US pollution were increased by Dollars 37m to Dollars 248m
(Pounds 170m).
Higher than expected losses of Pounds 87m at Royal Re, where claims
continued to mount on business underwritten in earlier years, were despite
the subsidiary's withdrawal from most markets.
Losses of Pounds 16m (Pounds 33m) by Royal's estate agency subsidiary also
marred the picture. Life assurance profits rose to Pounds 31m (Pounds 29m).
Overall last year, premium income at Royal's general insurance subsidiary
rose to Pounds 4.04bn (Pounds 3.75bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds
371m (Pounds 588m). Investment income increased to Pounds 521m (Pounds
486m), and income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 27m (Pounds
21m).
COMMENT
On several counts the immediate future for Royal looks rosy. Mortgage
indemnity and reinsurance losses should fall further this year. Much of
Royal's exposure to the personal motor market, where rates could begin to
soften, is through its very competitive direct telephone-based insurance
subsidiary. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 290m for 1994 appear well within the
company's grasp, giving a prospective multiple of only 7. Investors will
have been encouraged by the rate of yesterday's dividend increase. A pay-out
of 10p next year puts the shares on a prospective yield of 4.4, reducing the
gap with higher yielding rivals. The main question mark concerns Royal's
well-known exposure to potentially substantial US pollution claims. The
company says its reserves are adequate. If you accept that, it becomes
difficult to justify the sizeable discount to net asset value and the shares
look cheap.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Employment in utilities down 0.4m in decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries employed
between them about 900,000 people in 1983, according to Department of
Employment figures. A decade of privatisation and competition later the
figure had fallen to less than 500,000.
This is the job-shedding context in which the announcement from British Gas
must be seen.
The combination of competition, altered management culture, and, at least in
the case of telecommunications, changed technology, has seen a substantial
increase in productivity and a jobs shake-out over the past decade in these
industries.
Much of the job-shedding occurred in the run up to privatisation, but the
trend has continued since.
British Gas employed about 90,000 people just before privatisation in 1986
and is now down to 76,000.
The electricity industry in England and Wales employed 131,400 in 1990 and
now employs about 110,00.
Employment in the water industry has only fallen slightly from 47,000 to
about 45,000. British Telecommunications has dropped most dramatically of
all, from 240,000 to 155,000.
Job losses have in the main been among lower skilled workers, those that
remain are the better paid and higher skilled.
Pay analysts say that those who remain have been receiving pay rises well
above the average, often supplemented by bonuses to reform old working
practices.
At Southern Electric last year, such bonuses ranged between Pounds 250 and
Pounds 600. Senior managers in most utilities have usually done a great deal
better than that.
These new costs, combined with large redundancy payments - BT paid out
Pounds 1bn last financial year - means that real paybill costs for the
utilities have not been falling as fast as the number of employees. But in
most cases the job cuts are so large that the total paybill has still fallen
significantly.
The introduction of competition, deregulation and contracting out of
non-core services can also help to create jobs, although not enough to match
the losses.
In telecommunications, for example, Mercury, the main competitor to BT, now
employs 10,000 people; the two big radio telephone companies, Vodafone and
Cellnet, employ, 2,500 and 1,100 respectively.
Also, big price reductions have saved large users of telecommunications a
lot of money which may have helped to create jobs in other parts of the
business.
Whatever the benefits of privatisation the effect has certainly been to
reduce overall employment and to increase the gap between well paid 'core'
workers and the periphery of insecure, low-paid, employees.
As privatisation spreads from Britain to the rest of Europe this effect is
likely to be repeated, although less dramatically.
The European Commission is forcing the pace by requiring competition in
telecommunications and electricity supply and this is prompting several
countries to opt for privatisation. The German government is also
considering introducing more competition into electricity supply.
Over the past decade continental utilities have been an important source of
employment stability, and even new jobs, as the manufacturing sector has
shed jobs rapidly.
As yesterday's announcement underlines, that has not been the case in
Britain.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Merlin Green net revenue at Pounds 865,544
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net assets per share at Merlin International Green Investment Trust fell
from 106.6p to 74.6p over the 12 months to the end of December. The figure
per zero dividend shares, which were issued during the year, was 54.6p.

FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Paying a high price for Being in Control -
Robert Corzine on the costly demise of the old regional structure in favour
of five new businesses / Way forward after pounds 1.65bn restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one familiar with the UK gas industry ever expected that the task of
unravelling the largest integrated gas business in the West would come
cheaply.
But the Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge and 5,000 additional job losses
announced yesterday by British Gas was the 'mother of all restructuring
charges,' according to one City analyst.
Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said accounting practices prevented
British Gas from phasing in the costs of restructuring over a prolonged
period. 'We had to do it in the year in which the decision was taken,' he
said.
But some analysts suspect that the dramatic announcement may also have been
a reminder to the government and to Ofgas, the industry regulator, of the
practical implications of the decision last December to abolish, beginning
in 1996, British Gas's monopoly on supplying 18m of Britain's 24m
households.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided against breaking
up the company, and decreed that only the gas transportation and storage
business had to be separated by Chinese walls from the trading business.
But senior executives decided that five separate business streams were
needed to cope with increased competition.
Some analysts also detected the influence of Mr Richard Giordano, the new
executive chairman, in yesterday's announcement. Although he has assumed a
low profile since taking over at the beginning of January and did not attend
yesterday's presentation, his appointment was intended to be a catalyst for
the radical change of British Gas' corporate culture as well as its cost
base.
In his written statement Mr Giordano conceded that 'a restructuring of this
magnitude will be painful for some,' but ' . . . we will do our best to be
fair and generous to those who leave.'
The latest announcement brings to 25,000 the total number of job cuts to be
made over five years, although most will disappear over the next three
years, the company says.
There has been scepticism among analysts that the company could actually
meet previously-announced cost-cutting targets. But Mr Rogerson and Mr
Cedric Brown, chief executive, pointed to a fall in employee numbers at the
end of 1993 to 76,453, from 82,146 previously, as proof that British Gas is
actually implementing its plans.
The demise of its old regional structure in favour of the five new national
businesses should also help the company to meet cost-cutting targets,
according to analysts.
The regional structure was well suited to the last 25 years or so, during
which British Gas expanded its share of the UK non-transportation energy
market from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. But managers of the 12 regions
resisted moves which would have eroded their power bases.
'The regions were run like little empires,' according to Mr Simon Flowers,
analyst at Natwest Securities in Edinburgh.
Severance and pension costs totalling Pounds 1.31bn form the bulk of the
restructuring charge, virtually all of which will require cash expenditure,
according to Mr Rogerson. The cost per head will be about Pounds 52,000,
with pension provisions a quarter of that figure.
Other redundancy-related costs include re-training and counselling. Some
Pounds 50m has been allocated for training of staff who are staying but who
will need to assume additional tasks.
The personnel cuts will be made across the new business divisions, say
officials.
The physical division of the business units will cost Pounds 100m, with an
additional Pounds 60m needed to cover payments for leased buildings which
will no longer be needed. A total of 2,900 employees will need to relocate.
Mr Brown dismissed criticism that action could have been taken much earlier
to reduce British Gas's cost base, which will be cut by more than Pounds
600m a year as a result of the restructuring.
He said radical action would have been taken much sooner had it not been for
the prolonged period of uncertainty while the government decided on the
future structure of the gas industry.
'We began looking at restructuring two-and-a-half years ago,' he said, 'but
it would have been stupid if we had embarked on it without the clarity of
the MMC and DTI decisions.'
Mr Brown said it was still not possible to say how much emphasis the company
would place on its non-regulated businesses, such as exploration and
production and activities outside the UK.
Ironically, whatever international strategy emerges is likely to stress
British Gas's expertise as an integrated gas company, able to apply its
various skills in all segments of the 'gas chain' from exploration and
production to processing, distribution and marketing.
But Mr Brown said: 'We need to know what the shipping charges and rate of
return will be on our UK gas transport business before a clear international
strategy can be determined.'
Ofgas is to issue a consultation document on the subject in April, with a
decision expected by October.
The other big uncertainty facing the company is the way in which Ofgas
intends to open the residential market to competition.
One positive development noted by Mr Brown yesterday was an end to the
animosity which marked British Gas's relations with its regulator over the
past few years. It coincided with the appointment last November of Ms Clare
Spottiswoode as the new Ofgas director general.
'Both parties are now listening to each other', said Mr Brown, who stressed
that British Gas was only seeking 'a level playing field' with potential
competitors.
A consultation document giving detailed options for introducing full-scale
competition in the residential market will be published within the next few
weeks, with a firm decision on the way forward expected before the summer,
when government lawyers will begin drafting a new Gas bill for parliament to
consider.
Only then will it become clear whether yesterday's action will be sufficient
to put British Gas in control of its corporate destiny.

FT  25 FEB 94 / ICI rises 78% after drive to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weak pound and cost savings from restructuring pushed ICI's full-year
pre-tax profits up 78 per cent to Pounds 290m. The figure excludes
businesses sold or demerged last year, notably the drugs company Zeneca, and
compares with Pounds 163m in 1992.
The first year-end figures since the Zeneca demerger were in line with
expectations and were accompanied by a cautiously optimistic trading
statement.
Turnover rose 12 per cent to Pounds 8.43bn, mainly because of favourable
exchange rates. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said restructuring
efforts had enhanced pre-interest profits by a further Pounds 150m last
year. Sterling's weakness had added Pounds 75m.
After payments from Zeneca, ICI had accumulated year-end cash of almost
Pounds 1.7bn. Debt was about Pounds 2.2bn and gearing 10.3 per cent,
compared with 11.9 per cent in 1992 on a pro forma basis.
'This obviously places the company in a very strong position to capitalise
on the opportunities ahead,' said Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive. ICI was
looking at the possibility of buying parts of the troubled German industrial
group Metallgesell-schaft.
There have been no direct talks between the two companies, but they are
linked through Ms Ellen Schneider-Lenne, an ICI board member, who also sits
on the board of Deutsche Bank, which has a stake in Metallgesellschaft.
ICI's markets in continental Europe 'remained difficult', said Sir Denys
Henderson, chairman, but growth in Asia-Pacific, the US and UK should mean
improvements in 1994.
Earnings per share were 20.4p against 3.2p and the company held its total
dividend unchanged at 27.5p per share. Mr Hampel said the company's policy
was to have earnings of twice the dividend payout.
The industrial chemicals business, which accounted for 44 per cent of
turnover, made a Pounds 106m trading profit compared with a Pounds 17m loss
thanks to better volumes, lower fixed costs and exchange rate benefits.
There were signs of improvement in PVC and the new plant in Taiwan making
raw materials for polyester fibres was working at full capacity, said Mr
Hampel.
All sectors of chemicals improved except for tioxide, which was hit by low
prices.
The paints division, which represented one fifth of ICI's turnover, suffered
from tough trading conditions in North America and Europe which cut trading
profits by Pounds 12m to Pounds 103m.
Materials made an Pounds 18m profit after breaking even in 1992. It was
boosted by restructuring benefits, better volumes and a contribution from
the acrylics business acquired in July last year from US chemicals company
Du Pont.
Explosives saw profits fall to Pounds 52m from Pounds 59m, with growth in
Australian mining markets offset by weak demand in the US and UK.
Exceptional items included Pounds 106m for the loss-making US composites
business Fiberite, the majority relating to goodwill, and a Pounds 31m
provision covering the closure of Electroclor, a subsidiary in Argentina.
ICI shares fell 2p to 750p.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Drop in cable rates killed Bell and TCI deal: Companies had
settled all issues before agreement was called off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<TEXT>
Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc scuppered what was to have been
the biggest merger in the history of the US telecommunications industry
solely because of the Federal Communications Commission's action, this week,
to lower cable television rates by 7 per cent, the companies said.
The FCC's action lowered the anticipated cashflow of TCI, the largest US
cable television service company, by about Dollars 144m (Pounds 98.6m) a
year, said Mr John Malone, TCI president. This cut the valuation placed on
TCI by Bell Atlantic by about Dollars 2bn, or Dollars 3.30 per share, he
said.
'We were already at the low end of what we thought our company was worth,
mostly because of the decline of the Bell Atlantic stock,' said Mr Malone.
'The deal just wasn't meant to be.'
The companies declined to reveal the final figure of the deal, which was
originally valued at between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn.
Since October, when the merger was announced, Bell Atlantic's share price
has fallen from about Dollars 67 to Dollars 53. Yesterday Bell closed at
Dollars 54 1/2 , up Dollars 1.75. TCI's share price fell Dollars 1.87 to
Dollars 22 3/8 .
Before Tuesday's announcement by the FCC, both Bell Atlantic and TCI had
settled 'all substantial issues, including price' regarding the merger and
had even arranged board meetings for today and Saturday to approve formally
definitive agreements, said Mr James Cullen, president of Bell Atlantic.
Mr Cullen
also said that the terms of the deal had been altered to reflect the drop in
Bell Atlantic's share price over the past four months. The companies also
denied any problems with the Justice Department about the anti-trust
implications of the planned merger.
However, the FCC's recommendation that cable TV rates be lowered by 7 per
cent and that the rollback be applied to all types of cable TV systems,
including TCI's most advanced services, killed the deal, both companies
said.
Analysts were skeptical that Bell Atlantic had been caught by surprise by
the FCC's actions as a cable TV rate cut had been widely anticipated.
However, Mr Cullen rejected as 'ludicrous and absurd' the notion that the
deal might have been called off to put pressure on the FCC to change its
recommendations for rate decreases.
Bell Atlantic now wants to explore the possibility of joint ventures with
TCI. The regional telephone company plans to introduce cable television
service over its networks and look into an interactive television service.
The collapse of the deal could 'slow but not stop' progress toward creation
of 'information superhighways', offering multimedia communications services,
Bell Atlantic said.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Granada poised to clinch LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada looked set to win its Pounds 750m hostile bid for LWT yesterday
after Mercury Asset Management accepted the offer for its 14.2 per cent
stake.
The decision by Mercury, which has been widely seen as crucial to the
outcome of the battle, means Granada goes into the final day of the bid with
42.2 per cent of LWT's shares.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, said: 'It is extremely unusual
to have received such a high level of acceptances at this stage and we are
confident of success.' Although LWT put on a brave face, most independent
observers dismissed its chances of remaining independent. 'It has been on a
knife-edge but I think Granada has got it now,' said one analyst.
Apart from Mercury, Granada's final offer has gained the backing of a
further 8 per cent of LWT's shares. It entered the bid with about 17.5 per
cent and received acceptances for its first offer from around 2.5 per cent.
LWT said: 'We are very encouraged because it means that since the new bid
was announced they have been able to persuade only 7 per cent of the
non-aligned shareholders. We are confident that the genuine LWT shareholders
will see the case for independence and stay with us.'
Clearly disappointed by Mercury's decision, LWT suggested it had been
influenced by its 16 per cent stake in Granada, whose shares would be likely
to fall if the bid fails. However, Mercury has a policy of treating such
stakes separately, as they will be spread between clients. LWT also said
that by accepting before the final day Mercury was trying to influence other
shareholders.
It is understood that Mercury found the decision difficult but was swayed by
the need for further consolidation among ITV companies. LWT's management
appeared to admit as much by its attempt to form an alliance with
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Anglia.
LWT is believed to have the firm backing of shareholders with about 26.5 per
cent of the equity, including its management and staff, and Warburg Pincus,
the US institution represented on the board. Other large shareholders
include Fidelity, AMP and Henderson Administration. It was unclear last
night which, if any, of these had accepted the bid.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Shell warns on oil price outlook: Full-year profits of
Pounds 3.2bn - Fall in fourth quarter / Chemicals loss doubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices are likely to remain at depressed levels for much of this year,
according to Royal Dutch Shell, which yesterday announced a sharp decline in
fourth-quarter results.
Profits on a replacement cost basis, excluding the effects of inventory
changes, were down 18 per cent to Pounds 776m. Part of the fall was caused
by weak oil prices, restructuring charges and losses on chemicals also took
their toll.
Mr John Jennings, chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, said the average
oil price last year was Dollars 17 a barrel, or less than Dollars 10 in 1980
prices. Since then it had fallen to around Dollars 13.50. 'It is very hard
to see the price moving significantly outside the present trading range for
some time,' he warned. Shell expected the growth in demand for oil to rise 1
1/2 to 2 per cent this year, but there was little sign that Opec would cut
production.
The full-year result came to Pounds 3.23bn, just 3 per cent up on the
previous year's Pounds 3.12bn. Income before taxation amounted to Pounds
5.8bn on sales of Pounds 84bn.
The bulk of earnings came from exploration and production which made Pounds
2bn, up from Pounds 1.86bn. But the trend was downwards towards the end of
the year because of the falling oil price, although rising gas sales partly
offset this.
There was much stronger growth in downstream activities, such as refining
and marketing, where earnings were up 55 per cent at Pounds 1.99bn thanks
largely to higher refining margins, particularly in Asia.
The big disappointment was chemicals which made an annual loss of Pounds
409m, almost double the previous year's deficit. 'This segment of our
business continues to face extremely difficult trading conditions,' said Mr
Jennings. However, he pointed out that the US chemicals business managed to
get back into profit, and the underlying operating result of the segment had
flattened out. 'One is tempted to hope that the worst is behind us,' he
added.
Shell has been applying drastic measures to its chemicals division: staffing
has been cut by up to 30 per cent and several plants have been closed.
The metals division was also hit by low prices, losing Pounds 95m, but coal
returned to the black with a profit of Pounds 32m.
Mr Jennings stressed that the group remained 'enormously strong and well
placed to take advantage of opportunities'. He pointed out that the
underlying result, stripped of special items and currency effects, showed a
sharp upturn.
Although cautious about recovery prospects in the OECD countries, the group
was encouraged by trends in Latin America and Asia. Production of oil and
gas would rise as new projects came on stream.
Shell is proposing a final dividend of 13.8p, bringing the total to 24p, an
increase of 9.6 per cent. Royal Dutch is raising its total dividend by 1.8
per cent to Fl 8.60.
The result disappointed the market. Shell shares fell 23p to 699p, and Royal
Dutch Fl 5.7 to Fl 202.7. Mr John Toalster, an analyst with Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull, said Shell was out of favour, but the result showed the
group's financial strength and resilience to oil price movements.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Issue by RJR Nabisco to boost war chest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco the US tobacco and food group best known for its Camel cigarette
brand, yesterday surprised the stock market by announcing a Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) share issue that could signal the start of an acquisition
spree.
It plans to offer 300m shares, called preferred equity redemption stock,
which will pay a quarterly cash dividend for three years, then convert into
ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said the main reason for
the share issue was to cut debt from 44.5 per cent to 43 per cent of
capitalisation in line with a five-year plan.
But only Dollars 500m of the proceeds would be applied specifically to debt
reduction, Mr Harper said. The remaining Dollars 1.5bn could be used for one
or more significant corporate transactions, such as a joint venture, merger,
acquisition, divestiture, asset spin-off, or recapitalisation. 'We have no
specific transaction on the table, but this war chest will help us look at
things we couldn't look at before,' Mr Harper said. 'There are a number of
interesting possibilities. We have been talking to people and will continue
to talk to people, to find investment opportunities.'
Mr Harper said RJR Nabisco would consider any acquisition that provided a 20
per cent return on equity and fell within its 'area of general competence'.
This could include its growth areas of international tobacco, international
food, and domestic food - but not the domestic tobacco market, which is in
decline.
At the end of 1993, RJR Nabisco had Dollars 12.4bn of debt, largely
resulting from the record-breaking Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out of the
company organised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street buy-out
specialist, in 1989.
Last summer - shortly after Philip Morris, the rival US tobacco and food
group, prompted a damaging cigarette price war in the domestic market by
cutting the price of its Marlboro cigarettes - RJR Nabisco attempted to
raise Dollars 1.5bn by issuing 'smoke free' shares pegged to the performance
of its non-tobacco businesses.
The offer was dropped when not enough takers could be found. Wall Street
thought RJR Nabisco was asking too much for the shares because it had sold
substantial parts of its international food business to help pay off the
buy-out debt, leaving it over-exposed to the highly competitive US market.
Yesterday's announcement - and RJR Nabisco's specific reference to using the
funds for a recapitalisation - prompted speculation the company may revive
the scheme, but RJR Nabisco said it had no plans to do so.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Former managers 'misled' group: Metallgesellschaft
supervisory board claims it was misinformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The former management of Metallgesellschaft, one of Germany's biggest
industrial groups, altered documents and gave misleading information to its
supervisory board, the chairman told shareholders yesterday.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who has been chairman of the
Metallgesellschaft supervisory board since March last year, claimed that the
former management had taken actions 'so patently harmful to the group' that
they may face criminal charges.
He was speaking to about 2,000 shareholders of the Frankfurt-based metals,
mining and industrial conglomerate at a heated special meeting.
The meeting, which continued until last night, finally approved a DM3.4bn
(Pounds 1.32bn) rescue package negotiated by the group last month after it
nearly collapsed. The crisis was triggered by speculative trading in oil
futures by MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary, which gave rise to
losses of DM2.3bn.
The supervisory board was heavily criticised at the meeting by some
shareholders who called for the resignation of Mr Schmitz and other members.
It was the first time that Mr Schmitz had responded to widespread criticism
of the supervisory board's role in failing to prevent the debacle.
Mr Schmitz rebutted the charge that the supervisory board had failed
properly to monitor Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief
executive who was dismissed on December 17 last year along with the group's
finance director. Four other directors left at the same time. Mr Schmitz
claimed that the level of supervision was constantly being raised in 1993.
'It was nonetheless during this time that that the company massively
expanded its oil futures operations, which the management board had a duty
to report,' Mr Schmitz said. 'It did not do this. Moreover the supervisory
board was deceived with deliberately falsified information and was therefore
prevented from intervening in time.'
He said he then had no grounds to disbelieve Mr Schimmelbusch. It was now
known that minutes of management board meetings, provided to Mr Schmitz from
the end of May last year at his request, had been tampered with, he claimed.
'(These documents) had been censored in important passages such that they
did not correspond to the the actual course of the meetings or to the
essential message of the original board meeting minutes,' Mr Schmitz
explained. 'In the monthly reports, business developments at MG Corp were
reported in passing and without any indication of peculiarities, such as the
increasing commitment of funds for futures in the US.'
Oil futures commitments increased eightfold to 160m barrels in the 1992-93
financial year. It was unclear when the oils business became a serious
financial risk, Mr Schmitz said. Mr Schimmelbusch had not informed him of a
liquidity squeeze until December 3 last year, he said.

<TEXT>
Royal Dutch/Shell's annual figures confirm its happy knack for smoothing out
the inherent volatilities in the oil industry. With its methodical intent,
the group is also busy exploiting opportunities for future growth. Shell's
heritage has left it with a strong presence in promising far east markets.
Last year some 36 per cent of its Pounds 6.3bn capital expenditure and
exploration spending was targeted at the eastern hemisphere, promising to
give it a long-term competitive edge. Shell's Pounds 496m restructuring
charge shows its determination to cut costs and tackle its blighted European
chemicals business regardless of any upturn. High hopes are held out for new
products such as Carilon.
But like judo wrestlers, Shell's stock market detractors can use those very
strengths against it. Shell has been highly rated for increasing its
dividend throughout recession. But that has left it with an uncomfortably
high payout ratio in the absence of strong earnings gains. The 2 per cent
rise in the Royal Dutch dividend may be more indicative of the payout trend
than the currency-inflated 10 per cent rise at Shell Transport and Trading.
Such progress may pale in comparison with others, such as BP, which have cut
their dividend floor.
Shell's low financial gearing will also make its earnings rebound soggier
than those of more indebted rivals. Less adventurous competitors, boasting a
higher exposure to recovering European and US demand, could also win the
short-term applause.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The profits recovery at ICI owes much to self-help and good fortune. The
snag is that favourable foreign exchange rates can no longer be taken for
granted. Sterling was already working against the company in the fourth
quarter. Unless ICI has the stomach for another big round of
rationalisation, the best of the cost savings have also been had. While
slightly higher prices for titanium dioxide and PVC are encouraging, a
broader recovery in chemicals prices looks some way off.
Still, ICI is generating cash after capital expenditure even at this
depressed point in the cycle - thanks to a squeeze on working capital. With
gearing of only 12 per cent, now that Zeneca has repaid its debts, ICI can
consider some sizeable investments. The company argues that gearing of 30
per cent would be comfortable. That implies at least Pounds 800m to spend -
over and above normal capital investment - should opportunities arise.
Since the thrust of strategy is now towards tighter focus, smaller
acquisitions in ICI's chosen areas of competence look more likely than one
big deal. Financial strength is an especially strong card where potential
sellers have problems. So it is only natural that ICI should show a passing
interest in the tribulations of Metallgesellschaft. With the European
chemicals industry still mired in recession, similar opportunities will
doubtless arise elsewhere. Having taken the knife to costs, though, the
question is whether ICI can spend wisely.

FT  25 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is funny how British Gas, having spent 18 months claiming that it was
being crushed by regulatory pressure, suddenly finds that 38 per cent of its
staff and Pounds 600m of costs are surplus to requirements. The company
argues that it has long had plans to retrench, but that without a clear
regulatory framework it was unable to act.
Yet the gas business has not had the kind of technological change which has,
for example, transformed BT's manning needs. Nor can the Pounds 1.65bn
restructuring cost have been an excuse for avoiding the issue, since the
operation has an enviable 50 per cent rate of return. The suspicion must be
that if these people are not needed now, they have not been needed since the
company was privatised. It seems the monopoly was comfortably immovable
until it was hit by the irresistible force that is Sir James McKinnon.
Nor has British Gas found relief from regulatory pressure. In the medium
term, the RPI-4 price cap and continued loss of market share will be hard to
offset, even with these cuts. Gearing is still rising, despite a 27 per cent
fall in capital expenditure on exploration and production. The sale of
Consumers Gas in Canada will broadly cover the restructuring costs, but that
only underlines how international ambitions will have to become more
selective. A 5.4 per cent yield on the shares offers some defence. Even so,
it is hard to see how real dividend increases can be sustained if the aim
really is for a twice-covered payout.

Distress feeds on distress in financial markets. The FT-SE 100's 74-point
fall yesterday undoubtedly stemmed from the fall of over two points in the
gilts market, which itself can be traced back to worries about US bonds.
Whether there is much logic to these movements is another matter. There was
not much cash selling in UK markets, where the falls were largely futures
driven. There could be any number of reasons for the futures pressure. That
the market is reduced to guessing is testimony both to the worrying lack of
transparency of derivatives as well as to their destabilising power.
The fundamentals do not indicate great need for alarm. Equities may have
been trading on ambitious multiples, but they have fallen 7 per cent from
their peak at the start of the month. So far, the results season has lived
up to expectations; dividends have slightly exceeded them. As for bonds, the
Federal Reserve's pre-emptive tightening should be ultimately positive. If
it keeps inflation at bay, short-term interest rates will end up lower than
they otherwise would have been. There is no sign yet of inflationary
pressures returning in the UK. Nor can the authorities be keen to raise
rates again while the fiscal screw is tightening.
The real problem is that no one knows when the futures pressure will stop.
While it continues, cash buyers might as well sit on their hands and watch
markets become cheaper. Real long-term interest rates are rising both in the
US and in Europe, though, as liquidity disappears from the bond markets.
That cannot continue for long without jeopardising growth. Then equities
really would have something to worry about.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Universities turn to investment bank to help raise private
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK universities have appointed European Capital, the investment banking
boutique, to draw up a blueprint for them to raise finance from the capital
markets.
They plan to use the extra funds for academic capital projects, such as new
libraries and lecture theatres. The committee of vice-chancellors and
principals last year estimated that the universities' total need for extra
capital spending in addition to that provided by the government was Pounds
3.2bn.
Mr John Avery, head of estate management for the government's English higher
education funding council, which will be paying European Capital's fees
jointly with the vice-chancellors, said: 'We see the partnership as becoming
more and more dominated by the universities because clearly there is not
enough public money generated through us to support their capital needs.'
The first funds could be raised by the end of this year, provided European
Capital does not find any serious legal or technical problems. The company's
brief is to prepare a blueprint for a financial vehicle company in which a
syndicate of universities would raise money.
The scheme forms a significant step in the government's private finance
initiative, which is aiming to attract private funds into public sector
infrastructure projects. It takes advantage of freedoms given to
universities to borrow against their assets.
By raising money through a vehicle company that will spread the risk for
borrowers across several projects, universities hope to borrow on more
favourable terms than would be available normally.
Their borrowing capacity against assets funded by the government is still
limited, so that the costs of repaying the loan must not exceed 7 per cent
of their income. However, the funding councils will relax this rule except
where it is plain that a university's financial health could be damaged.
European Capital aims to produce a blueprint on how the financial vehicle
company should be formed by the end of April.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Over to LegCo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, will today publish the second
and more controversial of his two electoral reform bills. China has not
availed itself of the chance for further discussion offered by Mr Patten's
decision to delay this bill, while going ahead with the supposedly
'straightforward' items in a separate bill which was passed by the
Legislative Council (LegCo) on Thursday. Mr Patten could not delay any
longer if arrangements are to be in place for next year's election.
He has not chosen to incorporate into the bill any of the concessions which
the UK offered during eight months of fruitless negotiations with China last
year. These concessions were not popular with the pro-democracy block, which
comprises most of the directly elected members of LegCo, and without whose
support the bill would certainly not pass. But, by publishing a detailed
record of the negotiations in a white paper yesterday, the British
government has dropped a broad hint to centrist members of LegCo about the
sort of amendments it could live with. Mr Patten's advisers reckon the
pro-democracy group is more likely to vote for the bill after it has been
amended in LegCo than if the concessions are presented as British government
policy.
Outsiders may well wonder what is the point of this parliamentary gavotte,
when China is serving notice that it will ignore the result and dissolve the
offending LegCo as soon as Beijing assumes sovereignty in 1997. It seems
quixotic for Britain, after conceding so much, to be jeopardising its
relations with the world's most populous country and fastest-growing economy
for the sake of a few extra seats in an assembly which will only last two
years.
With hindsight, it seems naive of Mr Patten to have imagined that he could
persuade China, by a public demonstration, to accept more than it would in
private talks. We shall never know whether, if he had not chosen this
method, China might have been more willing to accept the 'through train'
arrangement giving LegCo members elected in 1995 security of tenure until
1999.
Yet if he had not set out his proposals in public he would certainly have
been criticised, both in Hong Kong and in the UK, for not even attempting to
set up a representative legislature before handing the colony over to
Chinese rule. Wednesday's vote on his first bill, when he actually had a
majority larger than the one that backed his original proposals, and
including almost all the directly elected members, suggests that support for
what he is trying to do persists among the general population, although this
is not true of the business community. At least this way he is giving Hong
Kong people the chance to experience two years of relative democracy, if
they so choose, and to leave China's rulers with the responsibility of
dismantling it in full view of the world, if they so choose.

The secret's out. Enterprise Oil finance director John Walmsley, who caused
a bit of a stir in August by handing in his notice without another job, has
resurfaced - back at his old firm.
Walmsley, 47, is helping Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton put together a
group of City whiz-kids to work on the great ideas starting to flow from
Morton's government-sponsored Private Finance Panel. Walmsley has known
Morton since his Arthur Andersen days, and Enterprise Oil chairman Graham
Hearne, Walmsley's old boss, used to work with Morton at the Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation. Helps explain why the PFP has taken rooms in
Enterprise's Trafalgar Square HQ.
However, Walmsley's willingness to take an unpaid job for the good of the
nation is not totally altruistic. His new platform gives him super access to
all the nooks and crannies of government, the City and big business. What
better way to look for a permanent job?

The French daily, Liberation, yesterday gave Jacques Toubon, France's
linguistically obsessed culture minister, a cheeky reply to his proposed
bill to ban foreign, particularly English, words in French public life.
Its front-page headline, the Englishness of which would no doubt merit a

reworking of the first English phrase every French schoolchild traditionally
learns: 'My tailor is rich.'

Banana skins have an irresistible magnetism. Britain's education secretary,
John Patten, is supposed to visit Malaysia in April to help push British
sales of educational equipment. Yesterday's news from Malaysia suggests it
may not be worth his going.
Malaysia is, of course, home to the Pergau dam, financed by Pounds 234m in
aid from the UK and now being probed by the foreign affairs committee over
possible links with a Pounds 1bn arms deal.
It would have allowed Patten to diplomatically avoid the National Union of
Teachers' annual conference. However, one man who might not be too unhappy
if the trip was called off is Sir Tim Lankester, now Patten's permanent
secretary. For it was he who, when at the Overseas Development
Administration, advised the government not to touch the dam with a barge
pole.

Lord Whitelaw, grand old man of Tory politics, appears to be enjoying his
return to the political limelight. Just two weeks ago, he forced Michael
Howard into a humiliating retreat on his plans to shake up the police.
Now Observer learns that Willie, as Lady Thatcher always called him, is

inevitable Tory defeats in the local and European elections. He is preparing
to tell John Major that, however much the prime minister admires Lord
Archer's campaigning skills, the extrovert novelist and former MP must not
be given the party chairmanship.
With his own position so precarious, Major will ignore such advice at his

Has Mick Newmarch, the Prudential's outspoken boss, lost his voice? The most
vociferous critic of the proposed Personal Investment Authority has been
maintaining an uncharacteristically low profile since publication of the

One theory is that, by leaving some daylight between his previous utterance

U-turn without attracting undue publicity. Alternatively, he may just be
pausing for dramatic effect before refusing to sign up.
All the same, the sooner Newmarch starts barking again the better. The

It had to happen sooner or later - gambling on gambling has arrived, thanks
to the Chicago Board Options Exchange. On Monday the CBOE starts trading
options on an index of 15 US casino operators on land and water.
It reckons the move will appeal to those interested in hedging exposure to
the gaming sector. It sounds more like a sophisticated version of the old
three-card trick.
But the decision is even more piquant, because Chicago has yet to get
involved in the gambling craze sweeping across the US. The only legal
betting allowed within city limits is on state-sponsored lotteries and
off-track betting on horses.
If Richard Daley, Chicago's mayor, had his way, the windy city would build
its own casino. No way, says Jim Edgar, Illinois governor, who's very
protective about his state's growing riverboat gaming business.
Why not join forces, and get the riverboats plying the city's waters?

FT  25 FEB 94 / No longer just a dreamtime: Nikki Tait examines the impact
of Australia's new legislation on relations between Aboriginal peoples and
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Douglas wants to build a crocodile farm in Broome, 2,000km north
of Perth. He already operates a crocodile park in the remote coastal town,
but said it had become overcrowded to the point where the crocodiles were
maiming each other. The business as it stands is too small to be viable. If
the new project were to go ahead, about 20 jobs, in an area with limited
employment prospects, could be created.
The problem for Mr Douglas is that the local Yawuru Aboriginal people
believe the proposed 21-hectare plot lies on land of spiritual significance,
and that the development could interfere with their ceremonial rites. So
under legislation that came into force on January 1, they have lodged a
claim with Australia's Native Title Tribunal, a new federal organisation to
arbitrate on indigenous peoples' land rights.
It is one of the first demands to be submitted to the tribunal. The process
will be complex. First, the veracity of the tribe's anthropological history
must be established. Next, the claim must be registered and advertised in
local papers. Finally, hearings to determine the claim's merits may take
place.
Meanwhile, Mr Robert Tickner, federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, has
ordered a 30-day halt to work on the site. 'At last it has been recognised
that our cultural heritage is threatened,' said Mr Francis Djaigween, a
Yawuru elder.
Elsewhere, other cases are beginning to be brought under Australia's native
title legislation, which was passed by parliament just before Christmas. The
first claim - from the Wiradjuri people over land in New South Wales -
passed the anthropological test yesterday.
Today debate over the degree to which the act impinges on state rights is
expected to dominate a meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, between the prime
minister, Mr Paul Keating, and Australia's state premiers.
The law stems from a 1992 High Court ruling that said, for the first time,
native title rights could exist in Australia if the indigenous inhabitants
had maintained a 'close and continuing' association with a piece of land.
With that single ruling, the doctrine of terra nullius - the notion that
Australia was unoccupied prior to European settlement  - was overturned.
Until then, Australia had been the only former British colony not to
recognise land ownership by the indigenous peoples - lagging Canada by 200
years and New Zealand by a century and a half.
The High Court ruling, however, was a mixed blessing for Australia's 265,000
Aborigines, who account for 1.6 per cent of the population. While
acknowledging native title rights, the court also declared that existing
leasehold or freehold titles, which had been granted lawfully, should not be
disturbed.
Faced with squaring these two seemingly conflicting requirements, the
government drew up the Native Title Bill. This set out a system for
'validating' most existing land titles and formally cancelling competing
native title rights. Compensation for genuine Aboriginal claims would be
paid by either the state or federal government.
The law also made an exception of mining leases. For these, it said, native
titles could coexist with an existing lease and 'revive' when that lease
expired.
When the Native Title Act was passed on December 21, Mr Keating said it
offered 'a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians'. He added: 'Today,
we move closer to a united Australia which respects this land of ours.'
But as the legislation comes into operation and claims, such as that from
the Yawuru people, start to arrive at the tribunal, the effects are proving
more complicated. The legislation was a political compromise between
conflicting interest groups and, like most compromise deals, it extracted a
price all round.
Those affected fall into four broad groups. The first comprises the
Aborigines and the indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait islands.
Widely dispersed across Australia's vast land mass, they entered the native
title debate with disparate views. For some, the act is a failure because it
eliminates native title rights on large tranches of Australia which had been
theirs.
Others have been more pragmatic, arguing that any chance to claw back some
rights should be seized. 'The land was ours and taken away from us,' said Mr
Peter Costello, a Cape York elder, during the negotiations in Canberra. 'The
European people are going to lead this country, and I won't be coming here
again. But we never said that we were going to take everything . . . We just
want some vacant crown land.'
This may be a realistic assessment of what Aborigines can hope to achieve.
Over the past 200 years, many have moved - or been moved - off their
forebears' land, so the 'close and continuing' land association requirement
will not be readily met. More than a quarter of the Aboriginal population
lives in Australia's eight state/territory capitals.
Using such residence patterns, Aboriginal leaders estimate that only about
10 per cent of their peoples stand a realistic chance of benefiting directly
from the native title legislation.
Because land association is most likely to have been broken when freehold or
leasehold title has been granted to white settlers, the best chances of a
successful claim will be against unused land owned by the nation. Most of
this lies in west Australia. Here a bruising battle between the state and
federal governments is under way, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the
short-term progress of any claims.
While Mr Keating's Labor government was battling to get its land rights
legislation passed in Canberra, the conservative Western Australian
government enacted different native title legislation in Perth. That removed
native title rights altogether, replacing them with much weaker 'rights to
traditional usage' of the land (for ceremonial purposes, for instance).
The Western Australia legislation is already under assault. Aboriginal
groups have mounted a legal challenge, claiming that it breaches federal
racial discrimination legislation.
Mr Keating has suggested that only those states and territories that support
the federal act will get federal help with compensation payments. Mr Richard
Court, premier of Western Australia, said that amounted to 'blackmail'. He
has some backing from other states and territories, which have yet to
introduce their own legislation on the subject.
Even if the federal regime eventually prevails - as seems likely -
short-term confusion is inevitable, further complicating procedures for
processing Aboriginal claims. No sooner had Mr Tickner issued his order over
Broome's proposed crocodile farm, for example, than the Western Australian
authorities announced they would challenge it.
As for the 90 per cent of Aborigines who may gain little directly from the
legislation, the Native Title Act promises a new land fund to assist
Aboriginal land purchases and management 'in a way that provides economic,
environmental, social or cultural benefits'. The fund will form part of a
broader 'social justice' package designed to address the disadvantages faced
by the Aboriginal population.
For many Aborigines, this is every bit as important as the act itself. But
they will have to wait for the details: Canberra has yet to set a budget for
the fund and has said the package would not be finalised until 1995.
The second group affected by the legislation is the mining industry, which
believes it has lost heavily under the new law. It complains that the costs
of doing business in Australia will go up, forcing many companies to look
abroad for new projects.
To some extent, however, the complaints of the mining industry are
exaggerated. Existing leases are 'validated' by the new act, and if a lease
granted before 1994 contained a specific right to renew, that too is
enforceable.
But future exploration, say the mining companies, is another matter. The
Australian Mining Industry Council estimated that the new tribunal might
delay the development of a project by up to two years, and said its members
were already reassessing their exploration plans.
'Title problems are getting worse,' said Mr Hugh Morgan, head of Western
Mining and one of the Native Title Act's most outspoken critics. 'Most
exploration programmes are studying their navels at present for 1994-95.
They (the implications of the Act) are only slowly permeating down.'
The AMIC points to a report by the Centre of International Economics on the
impact of an Aboriginal land rights law that operated in the Northern
Territory since 1976, and the degree to which it has restricted mining
activity. The report estimates that the law has cost the Northern Territory
about ADollars 2.39bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in income over the period.
Defenders of the federal act, however, point out that Northern Territory law
differs significantly from the new legislation - giving Aborigines a right
of veto over mining exploration, for example. At the same time, they say,
the CIE study used figures based on numbers of exploration licences. That
gives a distorted picture, because exploration on Aboriginal land tends be
large scale. Four-fifths of the minerals produced in the Northern Territory
come from Aboriginal land, according to the Central Land Council, which
represents local Aboriginal landholders and claimants.
Nevertheless, the need to resolve native title issues will inevitably add
something to a mining company's costs. How much, and the extent to which it
makes offshore alternatives more attractive, will depend on a variety of
factors - ranging from the efficiency of the Native Title Tribunal and the
attitude of individual Aboriginal groups to external factors such as
Australia's exchange rate.
The mining industry admits that it will take time for the impact of the new
law to be felt. 'In fact, the exploration dollar spent over the next couple
of years will probably go up,' said Mr Geoffrey Ewing, assistant director of
the AMIC, pointing to the long-term nature of the mining business. But
eventually, he warned, 'it's just one of those things which will tip the
balance for some companies'.
Other land-based industries, ranging from Australia's farming community to
the large tourism sector, are the third group affected by the act. In
general, thanks to deft lobbying by the National Farmers Federation, these
are relatively well protected under the legislation because land titles will
be validated.
Any new businesses, however, and those looking to expand or relocate will in
future have to bear in mind the possibility of an Aboriginal challenge - as
the Malcolm Douglas case demonstrates.
The fourth principal effect of the new legislation is on Australian
identity. Most sea-hugging, city-dwelling Australians learn about the
problems of the Aboriginal population second-hand, but their reaction to the
legislation nonetheless has been mostly favourable. As Mr Keating said, no
one's home would be seized, taxes had not risen, jobs were not affected. For
little obvious cost, Australians had gained a sense of having righted old
wrongs.
Whether this mood would persist if an economic price became apparent is more
debatable. There have been suggestions that the costs of the native title
legislation, plus the accompanying Aboriginal social justice package, could
lead to a tax rise at a later date. But even if federal finances taxes do
increase, Australia's long-term unemployment problem is more likely to be
blamed than the Aborigines.
All along, realpolitik has been at the centre of the Australian native title
debate. The country has tried to find a method of melding its original
culture, with its spiritual values and its belief that land is integral to a
way of life, with a more commercial, western approach. While the solution
may lack elegance, Australia is at least offering something to its
indigenous peoples - albeit 200 years too late.
As one Perth-based judge, commenting on the Yawuru case, remarked: 'On one
view, this is a classic clash between God and mammon. The economic interests
of a commercial enterprise are set against the spiritual and cultural life
of a section of the community.
'Of course,' he continued, 'it is not that simple. Both sets of interests
are entirely legitimate.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Yeltsin bends to the winds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The west can no longer base its policies on the assumptions that Russia will
manage market-oriented reform, remain democratic and continue to be
co-operative. But it must also prevent prophecies of doom from becoming
self-fulfilling. Unfortunately, past performance does not suggest it will
walk this tightrope with skill.
Russia's more assertive stance in eastern Europe and the Balkans, a spy
scandal in Washington, the decision of the parliament to grant amnesty to
organisers of last October's uprising and Mr Yeltsin's speech yesterday all
give cause for concern, particularly after the election results and the
resignation of reformers from the government. The speech shows how far the
Russian president feels obliged to adopt the attitudes of his opponents. It
also demonstrates the lack of any coherent economy policy.
What were Mr Yeltsin's main themes? That the Russian state must be
strengthened; that it must defend Russians living in the 'near abroad'; that
Nato must not expand; and, finally, that the tax burden must be cut, while
both the poor and a range of strategic industries are helped.
What, other than that the Russian president is confused, can be concluded
from this litany? One conclusion is that a weakened Mr Yeltsin is trying to
marry the reforming hedgehog with the reactionary snake, the mistake for
which he once condemned Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. A second is that this is
unlikely to endure. Yesterday the rouble fell from 1,624 against the US
dollar to 1,657. Accelerating inflation is unlikely to prove a workable -
still less a palatable - way of bridging the gap between claims upon the
state and the inability of that cadaver to meet them.
This government will soon find itself in dire straits. The west must be able
to respond to that eventuality, for it is conceivable - if unlikely - that
another window for reform would then emerge. The meeting of the finance
ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries in Germany this weekend is the occasion for discussing
what it would then do.
Apparently, the finance ministers and central bank governors intend to ask
the new Russian government to assure them of its determination to bring the
country's inflation under control. In return, they hope to liberate the
funds agreed at the last world economic summit in Tokyo. Nothing could be
more ill-timed. The assurances would be worthless, and aiding a government
that has no real commitment to reform, after failing to aid one that did,
would be typically absurd.
Western policy must be a nuanced holding operation. Russia is not yet a
reliable friend. Nor is it a convinced enemy. The west bears part of the
blame for the failure to achieve the former. It must avoid acting now in
ways that guarantee the latter. The only possible approach is to respond to
provocation, while encouraging co-operation. It will not be easy. But who
imagined it would be?

<TEXT>
Public spending outstrips the willingness of taxpayers to fund it in most
countries of the OECD. Yet there remains considerable demand for greater
investment in infrastructure such as roads, railways and river crossings.
Public services are also denied funds for desirable capital projects.
Demographic trends mean that such pressures are likely to increase. A
shrinking band of people of working age will have to finance public
services, while demand for those services rises from the growing band of
those who have retired. The idea of meeting needs for public services and
infrastructure through private sector investment is proving attractive in
many countries.
This week's decision by the UK Labour party to explore the private financing
of public projects is therefore welcome. A party that promises better public
services needs to explain how it will fund them in an era when the taxpayer
demands more for less. Harnessing private sector capital and management
expertise may be one way of achieving that. If Labour's initiative is to be
convincing, however, the party will need to reconsider its policy of
clamping down on the private sector in the National Health Service.
Despite this inconsistency, Labour's conversion has succeeded in
discomfiting the Conservative government whose private finance initiative,
launched in November 1992, has yet to show any real progress. A list of
projects issued by the Treasury as evidence of its success is heavily larded
with proposals that have yet to get off the drawing board. The accompanying
brochure is consequently filled with artists' impressions rather than
pictures of holes in the ground.
The absence of progress has created a mood of cynicism among those who might
build or finance infrastructure projects. An attempt to sell the
government's initiative to the City at the Mansion House on Tuesday
encountered deep scepticism. As Sir Alastair Morton, the businessman brought
in last November to push the initiative forward, observed, a lot of
businesses have spent a lot of money on proposals and so far have very
little to show for it.
One reason for this is that there is still not a clear understanding in
Whitehall of the level of risk that the private sector will assume in joint
projects. Another is that there are too few incentives for civil servants to
approve them. The search for a perfect formula means that the best has
become the enemy of the good.
One way to shift the logjam would be to set targets for involving the
private sector in areas of public expenditure where the greatest
contribution could be made. Broadcasters, for example, are already required
to use independent producers for 25 per cent of their output. The Social
Market Foundation, an independent thinktank, recently proposed similar
targets for organisations financing public services. The proposal has merit.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY STEEN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It's not just living but the cost of dying which will be outside many
people's reach ('Rule change may push up funeral costs', February 22). Nor
do I believe Europe can be blamed for a possible increase of Pounds 100m in
our funeral costs. It is more likely the result of over-zealous
interpretation by our public officials of rules and regulations made under
the Environmental Protection Act.
The fault lies not with Brussels but with the UK government, which has
allowed the civil service far too much latitude. Nor can we wait for the
passing of the deregulation bill, currently before Parliament; the bill's
teeth are yet to be sharpened let alone tested.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better to lock in directors with
options - or offer them a riskier route? (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER NEWHOUSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Alan Judes (Letters, February 19) laments that the value of share
options is not made clear at the time they are granted. But is he not asking
for the impossible? Even if, as he suggests, 'the value of traded options is
reported on a daily basis', it is misleading to suggest that the application
of a standard valuation formula (such as Black &amp; Scholes) to directors'
remuneration will move corporate governance any further forward. The real
problem with share options is that no one really knows what they will be
worth. Executives and companies alike quite rightly take the view that at
the time of grant the value lies in an as yet unrealised prospect of gain.
The solution lies not in the 'proper disclosure of the value of the option
grants' but in changing the role of shares in long-term incentive schemes
for top management. By granting shares (not options) on the basis of the
company's performance and then locking up those shares for a holding period,
the company can show a real prospective value to both executive and
shareholders. This arrangement, unlike share options, makes a shareholder of
the executive who, like other investors, will lose money if the share price
falls.
The larger companies are now replacing directors' share options with this
kind of scheme, so the joke of it is that by the time the accounting
standards board finally determines a basis for disclosing the value of share
options in the report and accounts, share options may no longer represent a
significant part of directors' remuneration packages.

<TEXT>
Sir, While the position outlined by Mr C W Daws (Letters, February 22)
regarding share options is correct it overlooked another central point.
Share options, as well as rewarding directors, normally, by their structure,
tie them to a company for a number of years as it is usual to have a waiting
period before the option can be exercised.
A cash bonus scheme could only achieve this same aim if payment were
deferred for several years, perhaps on a 'rolling forward' basis.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Grab for a lifebelt: Auditors want to put a cap on their
liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Larry Weinbach, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, the world's largest
accountancy firm, does not hesitate when asked to name the three most
important challenges for his profession today: 'Litigation, litigation and
litigation.'
Mr Weinbach has been leading a campaign in the US to limit the exposure of
auditors to litigation. Yesterday, the largest eight accountancy firms in
the UK joined the bandwagon.
The UK firms want company law amended to allow auditors to negotiate limits
on their liability if they are sued when a company collapses. They would
like to change the principle of joint and several liability in English law,
by which the courts can force auditors to pay the full extent of any damages
regardless of their degree of blame.
However, the firms recognise the difficulty of winning public support for
such a radical change. So in the short term they are calling for section 310
of the 1985 Companies Act to be excised. Under this clause, first introduced
in company law in 1928, auditors are forbidden to place any limit on their
liability. If the section were removed, auditors would be free to negotiate
a cap on their damage liability calculated as a multiple of their audit fee.
Under the present system, the firms' exposure is unlimited, at a time when
the sums to which they are exposed have escalated sharply. In the most
notable example, legal actions commenced against auditors in connection with
the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International total more than
Dollars 8bn in damages.
Settlements reached with auditors in the past few years have also involved
large sums. For example, Ernst &amp; Young paid out Dollars 110m last year in
connection with its audit of a company acquired by Allied Irish Banks, and
Dollars 400m in 1992 in connection with its work on savings and loan
institutions (the equivalent of UK building societies) in the US.
The firms argue that they are increasingly seen as tempting targets for
plaintiffs because they are perceived to have 'deep pockets' - substantial
resources generated by profits or insurance cover. Other potential
defendants in corporate collapses, such as the directors, often have minimal
assets and are therefore not pursued for compensation.
In a submission on Tuesday to the Department of Trade and Industry, the
firms argue that if they remain unable to cap their liability they may turn
away high-risk clients and raise audit fees.
'There is a real danger that firms will collapse,' says Mr Ian Brindle,
senior partner of Price Waterhouse. 'The Big Six firms could become the big
three within a very short space of time.' The firms say that commercial
insurers have stopped providing cover after concluding that the risks of
audit litigation settlements are unquantifiable.
The report sent to the DTI suggests that the number of claims against the
largest six firms jumped from just three in 1982-83 to 627 last year. Over
the same period, insurance premiums increased by a factor of nearly 38 and
the limits below which the firms had no external cover rose 27 times.
For the largest eight firms, insurance premiums, negligence claims and legal
costs as a proportion of audit fee income are calculated to have risen over
the past decade from 2.6 per cent to 8 per cent.
Not everyone is swayed by such figures, however. There are two significant
objections: that auditors are only facing legal actions because they have
audited negligently; and that the firms are still highly profitable and the
crisis not as great as they portray.
Mr Martin Hayman, group legal adviser to Standard Chartered, the
international banking group, says: 'If auditors were doing their job
properly and went back to basics we would not have this litigation. From our
experience there has been a manifest failure by them to carry out their
responsibilities.' The bank successfully sued Coopers &amp; Lybrand and other
defendants for Dollars 62m in 1992 in connection with the audit of
Miniscribe, the US disc-drive maker
Mr John Newman, a partner with Chantrey Vellacott, a medium-sized
accountancy firm, says: 'The campaign is riddled with the illogic that can
only arise through self-interest. Auditors have been given a government
licence to conduct their work. That comes with a cost. Just show me a case
in the last 10 years where the firms have paid out unjustly.'
Mr Brindle replies: 'We do not do every audit perfectly. We are human
beings. If we made a mistake we are willing to pay our fair share. But we
object to paying everyone else's share too. Fairness seems to have gone out
of the window.'
Mr Hayman is also sceptical about the selective figures chosen by the firms
to present their case, which do not show data such as the total value of
claims or settlements, and which give no idea of the firms' profits or
assets. 'If people were to see the worldwide earnings of the firms, they
would not have any sympathy,' he says.
Mr Brindle of Price Waterhouse says the DTI has not requested any such
financial information, although the firms would consider providing it if
asked. But he argues that the litigation crisis is now so great that 'you
may as well take my inside leg measurement, it's as relevant'.
Critics maintain that the argument for reform in the US - which has jury
trials for civil litigation and more writ-happy plaintiffs - is stronger
than in the UK. Mr Emile Woolf, litigation services partner at Kingston
Smith, the accountancy firm, says a change to the law may not be necessary
because recent decisions by English courts have tended to restrict the
liability of auditors for damages.
He adds that introducing and publicising a cap on audit fees would prompt
plaintiffs to increase their claims in litigation up to that level.
For its part, the DTI says that any new legislation would require wide
consultation, and would have to provide a solution that serves 'the wider
public interest', and not just the firms.
The accountancy firms draw some comfort from the appointment late last year
of Professor Andrew Likierman as government accountancy adviser. In 1989 he
co-ordinated a report - later dropped - calling for reform of the law on
audit liability. The question is whether the crisis has become appreciably
worse since then. At present, the public interest case seems weaker than the
self-interest of the firms.
Unless firms furnish additional financial information to the government, and
an analysis is undertaken of the quality of the audits for which they have
been sued, convincing the DTI and the public to support their case may prove
difficult.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Driving too hard a bargain endangers
audit standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A A SOMMER JR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your article, 'Auditing the auditors' (Management,
February 7). Certainly management should ensure that it receives full value
in exchange for a reasonable fee for audit services.
However, the Public Oversight Board, which oversees the peer review
programme of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in the
US, is concerned that unduly harsh bargaining with regard to audit fees may
result, and, according to information we have received, has resulted in
auditors taking measures to reduce the amount of work done in connection
with audits. This has led to a consequent lowering of the quality of such
audits.
In our report of March 5 1993, we strongly urged that boards of directors
and audit committees resist the temptation to drive the hardest possible
bargain lest they damage the quality of the audits they received.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No foul play over rent reviews for
commercial properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM MCKEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr V A G Tregear (Letters, February 9) questions the 'sense and
legality' of upwards-only rent review provisions in commercial leases. But
he presents no evidence to support the emotive suggestions that such
provisions have led to 'agony' for tenants.
In its submission to the government's recent review of the commercial lease
structure, the British Property Federation supplied detailed research on the
effect upwards-only rent reviews (UORRs) have on the market. The principal
conclusions of this research were:
1. For all but seven of the last 22 years, the retail prices index has been
at a higher level than either net rental income or rentals value.
2. Rental values moved faster than retail prices in the early 1970s and late
1980s, but in each case only for a period of about three years.
3. Of new leases agreed on a conventional basis in each of the past 22
years, all but those let in 1989 and 1990 would have produced savings for
the tenant compared with RPI-linked agreements. The average level of savings
to the tenant would have been 24 per cent of the total rent bill.
From this, we see nothing to support Mr Tregear's passionate cry of foul
play.
The government is expected to make an announcement on the conclusions of its
review shortly. There is no case for intervention based on the suggested
effects of UORRs or on principle. The market has demonstrated that it is
able to respond to client needs: 20, 15 and 10-year commercial leases are
now available, as are break clauses. The rental price of much commercial
space has also responded to market pressure in tenants' favour.
Over recent weeks, ministers have made much play of the government's
deregulation initiative and, more particularly, the powers it needs to
repeal legislation burdensome to business. The commercial property market
has responded to the rapid change in clients' needs. It would be a
particular irony if the government were now to ignore its own guiding
principle of minimum intervention by distorting the market.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DALLAS WILLCOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Euro Disney may want your readers to believe prices have been reduced
('Euro Disney shares slide on fears of restructure', February 23), but there
was no evidence of this when my family and I were at the resort a week ago.
As I pointed out in a letter to Euro Disney's managers upon our return, we
found food and gifts to be just as expensive as they were on our first
visit, in July last year. Food was about double what we expect to pay in the
UK; the gifts on sale which are available in Britain were at least 50 per
cent dearer; the variety of food available also continues to be
disappointing.
Euro Disney is still magic, but the trick of encouraging increased sales has
still not been perfected. Dallas Willcox,

FT  25 FEB 94 / Third-degree scolding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take Mr Paddy Ashdown's word for it, Britain is in a profoundly depressed
and bewildered state. 'There is a deep and almost tangible sense of a hope
that has died and a leadership that has failed,' the leader of the Liberal
Democrats says in his new book, Beyond Westminster*. 'There is a dangerous
mood of fatalism, . . . a loss of national self-confidence and even
self-respect,' he tells us. The promise of the last decade, it seems, is now
revealed as an illusion. People are looking for a lead, but do not expect to
find it within traditional politics. We get the picture.
Ordinarily, one might dismiss this kind of talk as the lamentation of a man
cursed with the honour of running the third party in a two-party system. The
Lib Dems know more than most about the politics of frustration, unfulfilled
dreams, broken optimism, unmet expectations. There was a time, little more
than 10 years ago, when Labour appeared to be in terminal decline. The
Liberals were given life by the sudden appearance of the Social Democratic
party, part of whose support came from Labour schismatics. The Liberal-SDP
Alliance became increasingly popular. It undertook to meet the aspirations
of millions of people who had rejected socialism but could not accept what
was becoming known as Thatcherism.
Consider what has happened since. In the 1983 general election, the Alliance
attracted a quarter of the vote, only two points behind Labour's 27.6 per
cent. In the feverish imagination of its supporters, it was about to
overtake the people's party. In 1987 the Liberals and SDP, counted together,
crept up a point, but Labour moved ahead three, to 30.8 per cent. After that
the partnership collapsed. The bulk of the SDP merged with the Liberals and
the rump was wound up.
When he became leader, Mr Ashdown had to build a new centre party out of
burnt embers and ashes. He had half a term in which to do it. At the April
1992 election the score was: Labour 34.4 per cent, Lib Dems 17.8 per cent.
The Labour party not only moved well ahead in popular votes; it also chalked
up more constituencies in which it was placed an encouragingly close second
behind the Conservatives.
These figures can be interpreted in two ways. Labour optimists say that the
third party is on its way out; that their natural prize is an overall
majority in 1996. The early 1980s schism is healing. History is just being a
little slow about it. Lib Dems respond that their April 1992 vote was a
miracle, considering their disarray only three years previously. They came
from nowhere to the votes of nearly a fifth of the electorate. They have
since equalled or outperformed Labour in local elections and by-elections.
Their support is, at last, geographically concentrated. This gives them the
power necessary for success under the first-past-the-post system. An
analysis of opinion polls and other statistical evidence published by the
Electoral Reform Society yesterday suggests that the Lib Dems might be the
biggest gainers in the elections to the European Parliament on June 9.
Victories are also anticipated in the local council elections in May. All
this, plus the possible capture of Eastleigh from the Tories at the
forthcoming by-election would put the Lib Dems back in the headlines.
Mr Ashdown's book must be seen in the context of this arithmetic. The two
larger parties do not offer national salvation. The Lib Dems are tempted to
offer something different in order to succeed. Their speciality has always
been to act locally and think expediently. The Lib Dem leader has gone
local, and thought through the consequences. During parts of 1993 he spent
half his working week outside Parliament visiting and sometimes working with
non-famous, non-political people in the worst areas of Bristol, London,
Manchester and Liverpool. He went down the mine at Monktonhall and spent
time with silk weavers in Suffolk. His 21 excursions in the British Isles,
plus one in Bosnia, led him to the dark conclusions summarised above.
He found optimism to balance the gloom. Where people were free to arrange
things for themselves, through self-help, local community organisations,
small business and the like, he discovered the theme for a subtitle:
'Finding hope in Britain.' He is clear about the direction in which politics
should now travel. 'This country will not solve its problems unless we can
unleash the power and imagination of Britain's communities,' he writes.
Westminster, the home of the national Parliament, was not one of the
solutions; 'it has become one of the problems'.
It is too easy to point out that winning at Westminster has always been a
particularly knotty problem for the Lib Dems. Mr Ashdown's book, which was
worth doing and is worth reading, could then be dismissed.
Let us rather address his effort with the seriousness it deserves. The
policy implications of his experiences among the people are not particularly
profound, but they are not insignificant either. Never mind the tedious
details. Hours could be spent debating whether he is right about taxation or
health, or questioning trendy terms like 'partnership'. The generality is
what matters at this stage.
It is as follows: the Lib Dem leader postulates a less hierarchical society,
in which a better-educated population depends less on central government.
Communities would take responsibility for their own actions. He would run
against the administration just as Lady Thatcher did in her heyday. The
difference is that he would not strengthen Whitehall's control over local
initiatives. That is the mistake now being made, in spades, by Mr John
Major's government.
Sounds familiar, does it not? It is. Similar statements came from
pre-Thatcher Conservatives. They are beginning to be heard, if slightly
muffled, from the post-Thatcher Labour party. The Lib Dems will have a
useful role while Labour's slow and doubtful conversion to getting central
government off our backs remains untested. Meanwhile, Mr Ashdown has made
himself the principal opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, eclipsing the
Labour chap, whoever he may be, with his persistent and pointed questioning
on Bosnia. It would, however, be a mistake to conclude that there is a seat
in a Labour cabinet waiting for him. The voters will decide that.

<TEXT>
Sir, Surely you do not believe that the panel of 'wise men' (Leading
article, February 23) was set up to serve the public and demonstrate the
willingness of government to listen to its critics? It was really a cunning
ploy to disarm its critics, by proving that even the best-paid experts don't
know what's going to happen, nor what should be done to make it better.
As Samuel Brittan showed recently with OECD forecasts, we could have done
them as well by throwing dice.
With the opposition barely differing from the Tories on economic policy, now
is the time to hand over management of the economy to a truly independent
body: the National Lottery.

Friday's schedules prove vividly the remarkably unchanging nature of much
British television. Sometimes it is a matter of repeats. Captain Scarlet And
The Mysterons (6.00 BBC2) was first screened in 1967 and The Man From UNCLE
which follows is even older: it started in 1965. The late-night sci-fi movie
on Channel 4, Them, (12.05) which has been shown umpteen times on
television, is 40 years old.
Some current series are almost as long in the tooth. The press review, What
The Papers Say (7.45 BBC2) first turned up in 1956; Britain's most popular
drama series, Coronation Street (7.30 ITV) began in 1960; and the science
series Tomorrow's World is in its 30th year (7.30 BBC1).
In BBC2's series about six Manchester students, The Living Soap Colin's 21st
birthday coincides with rag week (7.15). In Olympic Grandstand there is
women's figure skating, ice hockey and ski-jumping on BBC2 (8.00). In Love
Hurts the relationship between sub Sloane Ranger Tessa and rich rough
diamond Frank is getting more, not less, complicated (9.30 BBC1).

FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: An acquired taste for the pyramids - Patricia Morison
reviews 'Egyptomania' at the Louvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Venturi put jokey little coloured lotus-columns outside the National
Gallery extension and IM Pei's glass pyramid now squats in the forecourt of
the Louvre. But although post-modern architects now and then use ancient
Egypt as a source for references, repro-Pharaonic seems to have had its day.
It barely survives, except in the tourist gift-shops of Egypt which are
still crammed with pyramid paperweights and busts of Tutenkhamun.
Egyptomania, the Louvre's clever, complicated, but indigestible new
exhibition, opens a chapter in the history of taste. It shows the many forms
for which over two centuries, from 1730 to 1930, western art and
architecture gleefully and unselfconsciously adapted artistic motifs from
the land of the Pharaohs.
Although repro-Ramessian is nowadays rejected as kitsch, Egyptian style was
once extremely influential. It was more exotic than Greco-Roman, more
accessible than Etruscan, and highly prestigious. Egyptian style was
enormously versatile, associated with eternity, manliness, sexiness,
exoticism, non-Christian piety, and patriotism.
As an architectural style, it was also relatively simple and cheap in
comparison with classicism. So it was used extensively, for garden design,
prisons, cemeteries, in bourgeois villas, Russian palaces, and the
staterooms of Mediterranean cruisers.
The exhibition will travel to Canada and Vienna, although not all 300
exhibits appear at each of the venues. Yet there is something undeniably
special about seeing it in Paris. At the Louvre one is just a step away from
the magnificent obelisk looted from the temple of Karnak at Thebes. Close by
are squares where grotesque ceremonies were staged in which huge statues of
Isis, the Goddess Nature, expressed jets of wine from her breasts into the
cups of thirsty revolutionaries. France even has the best claim to be called
the cradle of Egyptology, born on September 27, 1822 when Champollion
announced that he had discovered how to read hieroglyphics.
How will the exhibition look elsewhere? At the Louvre, the organisers have
gone for style over comfort. Tiny video-screens displayed at the cases show
pyramids and obelisks in gardens and play extracts from Mozart's Magic
Flute. The overall design is a pitch-black labyrinth as if it was intended
to evoke some ancient ritual. I found it claustrophobic and tiring.
On the other hand, it made possible a great bit of theatre. Dotted through
the darkness are white rooms containing the 'real thing', famous pieces from
the Louvre's Egyptian galleries. Some pieces are Egyptian and some are
Egyptianising Roman sculptures, chosen not just because of their intrinsic
merits but because they inspired later artists.
The most remarkable of these antique pieces is the exceptionally beautiful
pink marble statue from Munich. It is one of the famous series which Emperor
Hadrian ordered to be made to immortalise his lover, Antinous, drowned in
the Nile. Because eclectic Rome was so enamoured of her Egyptian colony, it
seemed quite natural that Hadrian should order the gorgeous youth to be
represented as the god Osiris. From the mid-16th century, this sculpture
could be seen by visitors to the Villa Albani at Rome, setting a standard
for Egyptian art (as Antinous was thought to be).
The variety and quality of exhibits is overwhelming, with paintings,
furniture, architectural drawings, ceramics, sculpture, jewellery, and
fashion accessories. Theatre design gets a corridor to itself. There are
important set and costume designs for the Magic Flute, for Rossini's Moses,
and for Verdi's Aida, although, as we are reminded, it was the Egyptologist
Mariette Bey who deserves so much of the credit.
Apart from occasional treasures like Schinkel's Magic Flute designs and
Boullee's project for a warrior's grave, there is almost nothing in the show
to which I would give house-room. Not for me the model obelisks and sphinxes
for the mantelpiece, the tremendously elaborate clocks made to look like
Egyptian temples or Nubian slave-girls.
Anyone less insensitive to pseudo-Egyptian furniture will discover rare and
fabulous pieces. Among the most remarkable are two 18th-century bookcases,
one for a French civic library and one commissioned by an Austrian abbot.
Painstaking copies of Egyptian temple style, they were made expressly to
hold the 25 volumes of the celebrated Description de l'Egypte. Remarkable
too, is a late 19th-century grand piano made with two statues of pharaonic
noblemen to each leg.
The selection of paintings is quite as remarkable, including many comically
ghastly 19th-century specimens many of which look still worse for being
badly lit and in such solidly Egyptian company. They make the point well,
however, that successful painters needed to read up Egyptology if they were
to tackle popular subjects like Moses in the Bullrushes, or the Death of
Cleopatra.
John Martin's 'Seventh Plague of Egypt' and David Roberts's 'Departure of
the Israelites' vie to express the sense of grandeur of Egypt. Many of the
most successful painters and paintings of the age were Egyptian-minded;
Gustave Moreau, Hans Makart, and Elihu Vedder's 'Man Questioning the Sphinx'
of 1863. Sir Edward Poynter's epic vision of forced labour, 'Israel in
Egypt', is pure Hollywood and too exhausting to look at for more than a
minute at a time. Images of Cleopatra have a separate section in which the
supreme horror is Cabanel's Salon painting of Cleopatra trying out poisons
on her slaves. Fascinating, too, to see the notorious sado-erotic shocker of
1865, Federico Faruffini's 'Sacrifice of an Egyptian Virgin to the Nile'.
Luc-Olivier Merson's 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt' is another impressively
awful example of a painter taking Egypt seriously. In fact it is a copy made
in 1880, the year after the original had enraptured visitors to the Paris
Salon. On a moonlit night, Joseph lies flat out on the sands and the Virgin
Mary sleeps between the paws of the Sphinx. The unearthly radiance emanating
from the Christ Child in her arms inspired the novelist JK Huysmans to dub
the picture, 'Virgin and Sphinx, Jesus and mayonnaise.'
Egyptomania continues at the Louvre until April 18, sponsored by Fondation
Electricite de France. It then travels to Ottawa and Vienna.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: Beckett plays with master and slave - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To see Beckett's first two plays in quick succession, as one currently can
in London, is an engrossing and startling experience. One is startled, anew,
by the dramatic brilliance and depth of both Waiting for Godot (1949) and
Endgame (1956), but startled too by realising that the former, for all its
power as myth (the title has practically entered the language) and language,
is in some sense a rough draft for the latter.
Endgame, which the Fair Play Theatre Company is staging at Battersea Arts
Centre's Studio 1 (until March 13, then for five days at the Sheffield
Crucible) - astonishingly, it is the play's first London appearance in a
decade - repeats the themes and stratagems of Godot, but in a finer tone.
The master and slave relationship of Pozzo and Lucky, which arguably lends
the main dramatic and poetic interest to Godot, but only, as it were, in the
manner of a star turn, is enlarged to occupy the entire dramatic space of
Endgame.
Pozzo, inexplicably blinded by the second half of Godot, is continued as the
sightless, anguished, orotund egomaniac, Hamm; and Lucky - mute in Godot,
save for his famous single outburst of 'thinking' - has become the more
talkative, though grimly laconic, Clov (who does, at one point, pace about
'having an idea'). The Godot-expecting tramps Vladimir and Estragon are
downgraded in Endgame to Hamm's legless, dustbinned 'accursed progenitors',
Nagg and Nell, who too have spent happy days in the French countryside, or
think they have. The small boy appearing like a perplexed angel at the end
of each Godot act, does not need to take corporeal form at the end of
Endgame: he is merely, movingly, postulated.
In each play there are knockabout routines (with trousers) and gags at the
expense of the audience and the theatrical illusion: but Endgame's
long-ringing alarm clock has a power beyond the vaudevillian. Each play is
consumed with passionate meditation on time and human futility - but in
Endgame the yield of tragic poetry seems to me even greater than in Godot,
just as its construction is all the more lethally taut (a single act of
under 90 minutes).
But perhaps I only feel this way because Endgame received a performance so
roundly superior to that of Godot as staged by Efendi Productions at the
Hammersmith Lyric Studio. The idea behind director Lisa Forrell's
interpretation is that Godot is being awaited somewhere in the Levant; so we
get the sounds of sultry pipes, surging sea and desert wind; we get
hieroglyphics on the low stone wall and a big Mediterranean moon; but we
also get incongruous reminiscences of the Pyrenees and Macon Country.
If we get 50 per cent of Beckett's text, I should be surprised. Nadim
Sawalha's Vladimir makes up more than he ever says right, and when it is
right it is intolerably prosaic. His speech near the end ('Astride of a
grave and a difficult birth') - which, like so many passages in these two
prose plays, achieves the intensity of great verse - has as much moment as
it would if he were counting out money.
Kevork Malikyan's Estragon was better; Bruce Purchase's big and big-bellied
Pozzo was enjoyable for its impossibly elongated posh vowels; and Ben
Daniels's Lucky was a convincing study in frenzy, sweat, and mucus. Even in
his chattering tirade, writhing and spluttering took firm precedence over
the words themselves: it was not a G &amp; S patter-song approach; and
altogether the production expressed a fear of the verbal.
But Beckett plays, owing their coherence ultimately to poetry, can only
properly work through verbal precision and a careful rhythm of pauses.
'Rather difficult and elliptic,' Beckett wrote to Alan Schneider of Endgame,
'mostly depending on the power of the text to claw.'
Drama and even pure gesture come alive once that has been well understood,
as it so gratifyingly has been at Battersea. Scarcely a comma is out of
place in Alasdair Middleton's wise and stirring production, with Brian
Matthew and his wife Pamela Wickington a sharply observed Nagg and Nell;
Peter Bourke a stooped, shuffling Clov, clad in woollen vest and ineffectual
braces, intoned with a London taxi-driver's weary reasonableness that makes
the tragicomedy all the more surprising and potent; and above all, John
Quentin's magnificent, unforgettable, hardly to be bettered Hamm.
He is Shelley's 'old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king', enthroned on
his armchair in dressing gown, toque, thick red socks and goggles with
blooded handkerchief over his face ('Old stancher] You remain]'): thus in
situ at the start and even after the final applause. His fleet changes of
facial expression, perfect vocal pacing and hammy, slightly
Gielgud-flavoured vowels produced an effect by turns hilarious, starkly
poetic, and heartrending. His intermittent howls smacked of King Lear - to
whose tragedy Endgame is a worthy pendant.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: Away from the horrors of ice-dance - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are not times of plenty for dance-lovers in London. Ballet at Covent
Garden is, shockingly, in abeyance for a month; Sadler's Wells offers
nothing. Were it not for the prospect of Twyla Tharp's superb troupe at
Riverside Studios next week, we might suppose that Terpsichore had turned
her face against us. That television has been revealing the full horrors of
'ice-dancing' from Lillehammer only makes matters worse: we saw prodigious
technical skill dedicated to the triumph of the banal, the crass and the
bloody-awful. St Vitus is their patron; pop-trash their tune; deep-frozen
Kama Sutra their dish. Torvill and Dean merited several gold medals because
their movements actually responded to their music.
Meantime, up in Birmingham, that city's orchestral survey of 20th century
music - Towards the Millennium - has turned towards dance in its
consideration of the 1930s. Birmingham Royal Ballet has staged a programme
of three significant works of the period: Serenade, Job, The Green Table.
Each makes a point about the music-theatre of the age, though, save for Job,
not a musical one. Serenade is Balanchine's declaration of intent about
America and the classic ballet. It was his first work made for students
after he arrived in the US in 1933. It showed 'innocent' bodies how
classicism should move from studio to stage. It was also markedly Russian in
responding to Tchaikovsky, greeting a New World with a nostalgic glance
backwards, to a dance-system that had to be reinvented for a new land.
The result remains a masterpiece, in its seeming simplicity, in its stunning
craft and in its absolute physical rightness. Even after 40 years looking at
it, I marvel at how patterns, incidents, spring from the music, live in it,
show Tchaikovsky to us in the most loving and generous way.
The Birmingham dancers are, for the most part, willing servants of the
choreography. They need to yield more to its impulses - at Tuesday's first
performance they looked too much on their best and most reservedly English
behaviour - but it is a piece which will do them a power of good. The last
movement, where Balanchine colours the dance with hints of narrative about
the grief of love lost, was well done. Feelings must not be allowed to get
any more explicit, though, and the girls' unbound hair does not require
unbound emotions. The waltz needed a more secure male presence; Miyako
Yoshida was an unfailing delight, clear, buoyant, at every moment, and
Andrea Tredinnick and Monica Zamora were pleasing as the two other leading
women.
I think a case can be made for seeing Job as Dame Ninette de Valois' most
adventurous choreography. Other works - Rake's Progress; Checkmate; the
merry Prospect Before Us, which ought to be revived - testify to her
dramatic assurance and sense of character in movement. Job tells of her
sense of architecture, of grand control of means, a bold theatrical vision,
rare in its time, and rare today. It is important that this ballet has been
so well revived.
I can see no value though, other than as a museum exhibit, in Kurt Jooss's
The Green Table. I was bored by it nearly 50 years ago when I saw it with
most of the original Jooss dancers. It represents a not very distinguished
strand in German dance, and an even less distinguished strand of social
commentary.

Publifax costs FFr47,000 (Pounds 5,460) and has a telephone handset for
voice communication. Schlumberger says it is the first to be
purpose-designed for public use. The user lays the document on the surface
at the bottom of the terminal. The scanner is several inches above, behind
protection. This ensures documents cannot be lost and minimises the
potential for vandalism. Schlumberger: France, 47 46 62 47

Virtual reality is coming to the workplace. A project called Virtuosi - led
by British Telecommunications - aims to create a computer-generated
environment in which people can work with each other, wherever they happen
to be.
Virtuosi will allow users to work in groups from home or in different
offices and factories around the world. Two pilot services are being
developed. One will improve links between BICC's international cable
factories; a 3-D view of the total organisation will appear on a desktop
computer screen and users will be able to move round this to find people and
information. Video windows and computerised data will be integrated to
support conference calls.
The other scheme, in Nottinghamshire, will allow textile factories to
co-operate in designing and making garments. Remote buyers will be able to
see clothes modelled on a 'virtual catwalk'. Division, a UK company, will
provide systems enabling people to work in the virtual environment, with BT
and GPT (owned by GEC and Siemens) developing the telecommunications
aspects.

FT  25 FEB 94 / People: Mann's long stint at Logica comes to an end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Mann, deputy chairman of Logica, the UK computing services company, is
leaving the group he has served for 25 years. His departure will sever one
of the few remaining unbroken links with the earliest days of the UK
software industry.
Mann joined Logica in 1969 a few weeks after its formation by Len Taylor and
Philip Hughes and was a member of the small group, including the late Pat
Coen and Steve Feldman, which gave the company its distinctive character.
Managing director and chief executive from 1987 to 1993, he steered Logica
through some of its best times and some of the worst. He remembers with a
shudder the trauma of 1991 when financial services customers simply stopped
spending money.
'There is never a good time to leave a company you have been associated with
for so long,' he said yesterday, going on to point out that his decision was
made simpler by the ease with which new chief executive Martin Read has slid
into the role.
Not yet 50, Mann says he has no fixed plans and an open mind about the
future: 'I would be interested in non-executive directorships; there was
never time for that before.' He is also keen to spend more time on
information technology-related activities including the British Computer
Society. He will miss Logica colleagues and customers, he says, but not the
daily trek into London from his tree-bound retreat in Theydon Bois.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Technology: Keeping the knife at bay - Paul Abrahams reports
on the latest advances in prostate therapy, in a series on drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty years ago the American journal Science published an article about 24
inhabitants of a village in the Dominican Republic. The article led Merck,
the world's biggest drugs group, to develop a class of drug likely to save
billions of dollars in healthcare costs.
The article looked at the cases of 24 individuals who until puberty were
believed to be female. At birth they appeared to have a vaginal pouch and a
clitoral-like phallus. However, at about 12 the voices of these
pseudo-hermaphrodites deepened, their muscles developed mass and their
phallus enlarged to become a functional penis.
The authors proposed that the condition was the result of a
genetically-caused deficiency of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. This
enzyme transforms testosterone, the male hormone, into another hormone, DHT,
which is involved in prostate growth.
Researchers at Merck quickly spotted the medical opportunities of
controlling levels of 5-alpha reductase. If the enzyme was implicated in
prostate growth, then it should be possible to block either the production
of the chemical or its action.
According to Brian Leaker, clinical project manager at Pfizer Research, a
quarter of all men in Europe and the US have some clinical signs of benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) - a condition involving an increase in the size
and number of prostate cells - by the age of 50. That means that 17.2m men
in Europe currently display some symptoms. The condition becomes more common
with ageing. Those men in developed nations who survive to 80 have a 50 per
cent chance of being put either on drug therapy or the operating table.
BPH is caused by the physical non-cancerous growth of the prostate from
approximately the size of a walnut to the size of a lemon, says Leaker. The
expansion of the prostate constricts the urethra through which urine flows
out of the bladder. The symptoms of BPH include increased frequency of
urination, hesitancy, leakage and, in some cases, discomfort and pain.
Why the prostate expands with age remains unclear. 'It appears to be a
natural consequence of becoming older - as inevitable as night following
day,' says Mike Wyllie, director of discovery biology at Pfizer Research.
'We know that DHT is a stimulus to growth. But what is happening at the
molecular level is a 'black box'.'
The prostate consists of three distinct anatomical elements. These are a
capsule within which the prostate lies; the true prostate material; and the
muscle tissue around the prostate.
BPH appears to be caused partly by an increase in the number and size of the
cells in the true prostate, and by an increase in the size of the capsule
and muscle tissue around the prostate.
BPH is expensive. Surgery, which involves putting a telescoped strimmer
device down the penis, is the most common therapy. For men over 50, the risk
of requiring such surgery is between 25 per cent and 30 per cent. Annually,
there are more than 400,000 such operations in the US, costing a total of
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn).
Surgery can lead to side-effects such as impotence, bleeding and
incontinence. The operation also sometimes needs to be repeated within a few
years since the prostate continues to grow. A new form of surgery using a
balloon catheter which is inserted and then expanded has recently been
introduced.
The only previous medicinal therapies were herbal. 'In some patients there
is a measurable improvement in urine flow with herbal remedies. The problem
is that the condition waxes and wanes, dependent on stress, cold, and other
therapies. It's difficult to be sure whether the herbal treatment is
actually responsible for any improvement,' explains Wyllie.
After the Science article, Merck's researchers set to work developing a
compound that would act specifically on 5-alpha reductase. They discovered
Proscar, which in a single dose can reduce the levels of DHT in the blood by
an average of 65 per cent.
Merck, and many financial analysts, had high expectations for Proscar. The
company claims the drug, which costs about Dollars 530 a year per patient,
is cost-effective. That compares with surgery at Dollars 8,000 for each
procedure. Nevertheless, sales growth has been slow.
Many urologists have not been convinced about the drug's effectiveness.
First, it takes between three and six months for symptoms to improve;
second, the drug appears to work in only a minority of patients.
'The problem may be that there are two forms of 5-alpha reductase,' says
Kurt Hogaboom, associate director of urology and prostate disease at
SmithKline Beecham. 'Proscar affects type two, but it may be necessary to
control type one too.'
The clinical trials have also proved difficult to design, given that
placebos tend to work well - at least in the short term. Although Proscar
reduces levels of DHT, the direct relationship between DHT and prostate
size, urinary flow and symptomatic relief is yet to be established.
Merck is frustrated by the slow uptake of what it considers a
ground-breaking drug. 'This is one of the breakthroughs of the decade,' says
Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman and chief executive.
'I would not want to speculate why the urologists have been hostile to
Proscar,' says Edward Scolnick, president of Merck research laboratories.
'The drug changes the disease's natural history and it's safe. It's just not
rational not to use it.'
The irony is that other companies may benefit as much if not more from
Merck's work. Many have experimented to see if their existing compounds
might have an effect in BPH. The most successful class have been
alpha-blockers, usually prescribed for heart disease.
Alpha-blockers work by preventing the constriction of muscle, explains Akira
Shiga, manager in charge of BPH and cardiovascular development at Eisai of
Japan. The muscle around the prostate contains unusually large numbers of
alpha receptors which are involved in the expansion of the blood vessels. By
blocking the receptor site, the drug prevents the cells enlarging and so
reduces BPH symptoms.
Alpha-blockers in development or already marketed for BPH include
Synthelabo's Xatral; Pfizer's Cardura; Abbott's Hytrin; Yamanouchi's Harnal;
Eisai's Detantol; and Recordati's REC 15-2739 which is being co-developed by
SmithKline Beecham.
The benefits of alpha-blockers are that they work quickly in relieving
symptoms and are effective in about two-thirds of patients. However, they do
not alter the underlying condition. In addition, most alpha-blockers were
first developed for heart conditions and have a tendency to reduce
blood-pressure which leads to side-effects such as dizziness and fatigue.
A race is on to develop alpha-blockers that act specifically on the
prostatic alpha sites and therefore have reduced side-effects. Toichi
Takenaka, board director in charge of discovery at Yamanouchi of Japan, says
rapid advances in molecular biology have allowed scientists to identify
alpha 1c, a particular sub-type most prevalent in the prostate.
Merck is not abandoning Proscar. The group is 18 months into a four-year
study designed to demonstrate that Proscar changes the disease's natural
history.
Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham is developing its own 5-alpha reductase
inhibitor called epristeride. This is being targeted specifically at type
two alpha-reductase. Fujisawa also has a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor in
development.
'We still really don't know what is going on,' says Leaker. 'But our greater
understanding of molecular biology is going to lead to an exponential
increase in knowledge over the next five years.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / People: de Zoetes still in evidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The integrated securities houses that grew out of Big Bang in the City of
London have swallowed many of the grand old names of British stockbroking;
often the scions of the families themselves are no longer about either.
So Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, is rather
the exception, as is Simon de Zoete, 52, who has just been promoted to
become chairman of BZW's equities division.
Another de Zoete, his 46-year-old younger brother Nick, also works for the
firm in a portfolio management role. The two are great-nephews of Johnny
Bevan, senior partner at de Zoetes until he died in the 1970s.
Previously chairman of the corporate broking arm de Zoete &amp; Bevan, part of
the 1,100-strong equities division, de Zoete succeeds Tim Coghlan who is
retiring at the end of March on his 55th birthday. Coghlan, who has spent 34
years in the City, stays on in a consultancy role.
De Zoete will be working with the division's chief executive Jonathan Davie
and deputy chief executive John Varley. He will continue with the corporate
business he has made his speciality, where his clients include BAT, GEC,
Zeneca and ICI.
He steps down to deputy chairman at de Zoete &amp; Bevan, with Nick Brigstocke,
currently in that seat, moving up to chairman.
BZW has had a good run recently. Last week it was appointed joint broker
with Cazenove to BTR, and has also been appointed lead broker on the planned
flotation of 3i. Meanwhile, Simon de Zoete has more urgent matters on his
hands; he is leading the Granada team in its takeover battle with LWT.

FT  25 FEB 94 / People: Nott ventures into ProShare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gillian Nott, 48, a former BP executive, is to be the next champion of
Britain's small shareholders. On April 1 she takes over from Geoffrey
Maddrell as chief executive of ProShare, the body which promotes wider share
ownership and is sponsored by the public and private sector.
Nott differs from Maddrell in a number of ways. Maddrell, 57, had been chief
executive of a big plc (Tootal, taken over by Coats Viyella in 1991). Nott,
by contrast, comes from a venture capital background. She spent 12 years
with BP and was director of the oil company's venture capital business until
it was sold a year ago.
Since then she has worked as a consultant and has recently completed a study
for the Institute of Directors on the provision of enterprise capital in the
UK.
She describes herself as a 'moderately active' investor and says that after
she left BP she wanted to do 'something completely different' and preferably
'public spirited'. She refused to comment on the size of her salary but it
is thought to be less than the Pounds 100,000 a year which Maddrell was paid
by a Sainsbury charitable trust.
It has been known for some time that ProShare was looking for a replacement
for Maddrell even though he has only been doing the job since October 1991.
ProShare says he had been hired to get the organisation up and running and
now it is time to hand over to someone with fresh ideas. Maddrell has picked
up a number of non-executive directorships and a couple of chairmanships and
will take over from Sir Peter Thompson as ProShare's non-executive chairman.
Sir Peter moves up to president, replacing Sir John Harvey-Jones who is
retiring.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Labour price falls offshore - A north
Italian clothing and footwear company has closed its factory and shifted
production to Asia: 'The only chance of survival.' / Case Study / Fila
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fila, the fast-growing sportswear and shoe maker based in the north Italian
textile town of Biella, has found one way of coping with a fundamental
problem of European manufacturing. It is trying not to have any.
The company started in 1926 as a family-owned knitwear manufacturer. After
widespread changes over the past two decades, Fila's production is now
carried out by about 50 independent low-cost subcontractors around the
world. Roughly 85 per cent of output came from the Far East last year, with
just under 10 per cent of its goods made in Italy.
Fila has switched to Asian production as part of 'globalisation of sales,
sourcing and creativity', according to Mr Enrico Frachey, the 59-year-old
managing director. This has also involved an intense attack on the booming
US market, which accounted for 63 per cent of sales last year.
In his office in front of a wall map of China - 'more and more important for
our future' - Mr Frachey says: 'We are a kind of textbook. The only chance
for US and European companies to survive in this field is to do what we
did.'
Mr Frachey worked for Fila during the 1970s, presiding over its
diversification into sportswear, helped by promotional deals with stars like
Bjorn Borg, the Swedish tennis champion. He left in early 1980. After
rejoining in 1987, he pushed Fila's US expansion and built up
subcontracting.
Fila's basketball shoes, tennis gear and ski outfits compete for retail
supremacy around the world with leading brands such as Reebok, Nike and
Adidas. Now 70 per cent owned by the holding company Gemina, Fila closed its
last production line in Biella in 1983. The old factory floor has been
refurbished into a lavish auditorium for displaying its outfits to the
sportswear trade.
Staff in Italy, which totalled 2,500 in the 1950s and 1,800 in the 1960s,
has now declined to 270, with a further 670 employed abroad - mainly in
quality control, design, distribution and marketing. Turnover has rocketed
10-fold since the late 1980s. Overall sales increased last year to L741bn
(Dollars 441m) from L515bn in 1992. Fila hopes to achieve turnover of
L1,000bn by 1995.
Of its shoe production, roughly 40 per cent is made in Indonesia, and 30 per
cent in China. In sportswear, the two countries each account for 20 to 25
per cent.
Mr Frachey says making up a track suit in an Indonesian or Chinese garment
factory costs L5,000, against L35,000 to L40,000 in Italy. Even South Korea
is now a relatively high-cost site, with production about 40 per cent more
expensive than in China.
Saving manufacturing costs releases funds for the company's huge budget for
promotion and marketing - last year, L60bn or 8 per cent of sales.
With 70 per cent of its costs and revenues in dollars, Fila has become
progressively less Italian. Reflecting US dominance in leisure wear, even
Italian design is now becoming less important. 'Fila is losing the Italian
look. There is more feeling for American brands,' says Mr Frachey.
He does not exclude the possibility that, one day, the company may sever its
Italian ties altogether. 'The European market is a small project. We are
beyond this. Our market is the world.'
This ten-part series began yesterday. It will continue on Monday with a look
at the labour market.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Either get smarter or else get poorer -
European manufacturing risks being too inept to equal the US and too lazy to
match developing economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just how serious is Europe's industrial competitiveness problem? The
question falls into two parts. On the one hand, industry in Europe is by no
means exclusively controlled by Europeans. Much is in the hands of American,
Japanese and other foreign corporations. On the other, the big European
companies are by no means confined to Europe, but conduct their operations
around the world.
The first set of questions thus concerns employees located in Europe: how
far can they compete with workers elsewhere, regardless of who employs them,
and to what extent can they attract investment and technology to Europe?
The second has to do with European managers. Regardless of where they
operate around the globe, how well can they compete against their US or
Japanese rivals? How successful, in a global context, is the European
business culture?
The distinction between these issues is clearly illustrated by a company
like Unilever. With its Anglo-Dutch origins and head offices in London and
Rotterdam, Unilever appears a classic and highly successful European
company. But more than half its operating assets are now outside Europe. Its
European workforce has shrunk by a third over the past decade, while its
global employment has remained constant overall.
In such cases, European corporations are part of the mechanism whereby jobs
are exported from Europe. The interests of European workers and managers
are, thus, in one sense opposed. Certainly, if the footloose European
manager does a good job outside Europe, wealth will flow back to the
European parent via dividends. But dividends form only a very small part of
the wealth created through the value-added chain. And in today's global
financial markets, many shareholders in Unilever, Shell or Siemens are not
European.
The performance of European workers is best examined on a macroeconomic
level, particularly since the picture varies between EU countries. First,
employment. An OECD study of 13 leading industrial countries calculates
that, in the past 20 years, manufacturing employment overall has fallen by 8
per cent. But in Europe it has fallen 20 per cent (35 per cent in the worst
casualty, the UK). In the US it has barely changed, while in Japan it has
risen by 2 per cent.
A similar picture emerges of the contribution of manufacturing to the
economy. The figures are tricky to interpret, since manufacturing's share in
any developed nation tends to fall as a result of rising productivity and
lower prices. The issue is what is happening to industry's contribution to
GDP in volume terms; that is, at constant prices.
On that measure, the OECD reckons that in most European countries -
including Germany, France and the UK - the share of manufacturing has fallen
over the past 20 years. In the US it has stayed roughly the same. In Japan
it has risen.
In terms of research and development, the picture is rather less gloomy.
Between 1985 and 1990, according to a separate OECD study, the EU's share of
industrial R&amp;D rose from 27 per cent to 28 per cent of the OECD total, while
the US share fell from 51 per cent to a still-dominant 45 per cent.
As for inward investment, the picture is cheerful. In 1985, a third of the
world's direct inward investment entered the EU. In the late 1980s, the
figure rocketed, and by 1990 reached almost half. Some, such as Japan's
investment in cars and photocopiers, owed much to the formation of the
single market and the threat of Fortress Europe. Yet, it remains a
corrective to the idea that the rest of the world no longer sees Europe as a
place to make things.
But what does Europe now make? Japan's contribution notwithstanding, the
OECD's 13-country study suggests some dispiriting answers. Take, for
instance, the share of world export markets in manufactured goods. Over the
past 20 years, the US has seen its position eroded by Japan, while Europe's
position has stayed roughly stable.
Within that, though, there has been a tendency for Europe to export more
low-technology goods, such as Italian textiles, and fewer high-technology
goods, such as computers. In Japan, the trend is the reverse: high-tech
sectors provide the fastest growth.
The picture is borne out by data in a recent European Commission publication
which ranks sectors in the EU that gained competitiveness in the period
1986-91 and those that lost it. The top sectors are wood processing, ethyl
alcohol, cotton manufacture and leather tanning. Among the worst are
computers, office equipment, medical equipment and motor components.
Before Europeans become too depressed, however, it is worth examining the
other side of the coin: the competitiveness of European management in the
wider world.
American executives tend to dismiss Europe as an international competitor.
But as a senior executive at Siemens, the German electronics giant, remarks,
Americans wrote off the European electronics industry a decade and more ago.
Yet, in the past decade Siemens's sales in the US have almost trebled to
Dollars 5bn, while its US employees have gone from 13,600 to 33,500.
European Commission figures tend to support this observation. In a ranking
of the world's top 200 industrial groups by turnover, the EU plus EFTA
accounted for 73 companies in 1986, against the US's 79. By 1990 the
European total had reached 79, against the US's 68. Europe also overtook the
US in share of turnover, with 40 per cent versus 37 per cent. Some of this
may be due to currency movements: but there is no doubt European giants like
Shell, Roche or Unilever are the equal of their international competitors.
Having a number of star players, though, is not the same as strength in
depth. A telling sidelight comes from General Electric, one of the US's most
successful companies and its biggest by market value. An important part of
GE's strategy has been to avoid areas where Japan is strong and to focus on
those where the competition is European, such as lighting, power generation
and aero engines.
This might symbolise the danger for Europe. It risks being seen as a soft
target: no longer sophisticated enough to match the US or Japan, and too
lazy and highly paid to match the developing countries. As a half-way house,
this is unsustainable. In the long run, European industry must either get
smarter, or it will get poorer.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Gains via R&amp;D, market share and
cost-cuts - Three leading European manufacturers employ very different
strategies against their international competitors / Philips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is a classic case of a once-great
European company caught between the Japanese hammer and the American anvil.
On the one hand, its battles with Japan in consumer electronics have led to
huge losses. On the other, it has been obliged to abandon high-tech areas in
computers and semiconductors.
Philips's basic problem can be illustrated by comparison with one of its
chief competitors, the Japanese electronics company Matsushita. A decade
ago, Matsushita's sales in dollar terms were smaller than Philips's. They
are now twice as large. The growth of the Japanese company in the 1980s owed
much to the strength of its domestic market, from which Philips was largely
excluded by a combination of protectionism and the peculiarities of the
Japanese retail system.
But the Japanese advantage, whether fair or foul, was a fact of life.
Philips' determination to tackle the competition head-on has been
impressive, but also smacks of arrogance and inflexibility. Despite the
company's recent enormous losses, the struggle continues. In the field of
consumer audio, Philips is confronting Sony's mini-compact disc with its new
digital compact cassette. It has also just opened a factory in Holland to
make flat screen panels, a vitally important technology in which even the
Americans have conceded Japan a virtual monopoly.
Philips could be past the worst. Its cost-cutting and rationalisation in the
past couple of years have been on a scale to suggest that even the notorious
Philips bureaucracy has become genuinely alarmed. And the Japanese
electronics industry is facing problems which may prove structural rather
than cyclical.
Certainly, the investment community is inclined to optimism. In the past
year, Philips's shares have outperformed the Dutch market by two thirds.
However, the company has seen false dawns before. For the pessimists, it may
be more relevant to reflect that the shares have halved relative to the
Dutch market in the past decade.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Gains via R&amp;D, market share and
cost-cuts - Three leading European manufacturers employ very different
strategies against their international competitors / Michelin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michelin of France, the world's biggest tyre maker, made it the hard way. In
1960 it was 10th biggest, by 1970 it was number six and by the end of the
1980s it was number one. Michelin's approach had a Japanese ring: aggressive
international expansion and concentration on market share.
Greenfield investments, followed by the acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich in
1990, have resulted in a 20 per cent share of the world market and a clear
lead over Goodyear of the US and Bridgestone of Japan. At the same time,
Michelin has invested heavily in quality and in R&amp;D, being the first company
to develop and market the radial tyre.
Michelin's rise has been far from smooth. The Uniroyal acquisition was
completed as the US market collapsed. Last year, the European market did
likewise. For several years, the group suffered large losses. But most
industry observers believe the worst is over.
Michelin's ability to pursue its aggressive and sometimes risky strategy
partly reflects its ownership. As a family-controlled group in the
continental European mould, it can afford to be less concerned with
quarterly earnings and more with dominance in markets and technologies. The
benefits are evident in the initially costly but ultimately lucrative
development of radial tyres and in the strengths of geographical diversity.
But now a different message is emanating from Michelin's headquarters at
Clermont-Ferrand. With its market position established and little remaining
scope for growth through acquisitions or new capacity, the company is
shifting emphasis towards increased efficiency and higher margins.
This is to be achieved partly through new, higher value-added products, such
as the green tyre, which reduces fuel consumption.
The company has also embarked on job cuts which have seen staff numbers fall
from 140,000 at the end of 1991 to 125,000. Further reductions are expected
from the introduction of its C3m automated and flexible production process.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Gains via R&amp;D, market share and
cost-cuts - Three leading European manufacturers employ very different
strategies against their international competitors / Roche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche is an example of European industry at
its most effective. Last year, the steady rise in its share price made it
the most highly valued drug company in the world, overhauling Merck of the
US.
Roche's success is based on the performance of European workers at home and
European managers abroad. Swiss-based researchers have discovered a wealth
of commercially valuable drugs. Roche has also proved shrewd in acquiring
assets overseas, notably Californian biotechnology company Genentech.
The achievement owes much to the immense and, no doubt, excessive
profitability of the international drug industry, which governments around
the world are now seeking to control. The results for Roche have been
extraordinary.
Its spending on R&amp;D has been heavy even by the standards of its industry: in
1992, for instance, its pharmaceuticals research bill came to SFr1.6bn
(Dollars 1.1bn), or 24 per cent of its pharmaceutical turnover.
It was also able to plank down Dollars 2bn in 1990 for 60 per cent of
Genentech, a company which had only Dollars 500m in sales and very little
profit. Despite all that, Roche has cash and securities currently estimated
at SFr20bn (Dollars 13.5bn).
In the field of conventional drugs, it is worth recalling that Roche's
success represents a fairly recent comeback. It had a previous glory phase
in the 1960s, based largely on the tranquilliser Valium.
As Valium went off patent, Roche spent heavily on the search for replacement
drugs. For a while, it seemed the money was being wasted. The real strength
of the resulting research pipeline has become apparent only recently.
Roche has also built a formidable position in hospital drugs, claiming to
sell more drugs to US hospitals than any other company in the world.
At the same time, the purchase of Genentech was a particularly bold
strategic move, since biotechnology is a field in which the US has a clear
lead over Europe. Roche has thus hedged its bets against a possible
shortfall in European technology.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Flashes of opportunity amid the gloom -
Industry's performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's industrial performance varies across sectors, as illustrated below.
The picture is not one of unrelieved gloom. There are plenty of
opportunities as well as problems.
Cars: The EU is the world's largest car market and the world's largest car
producer. However, close to 30 per cent of European production is
foreign-owned, with the figure likely to rise to about a third as new
Japanese plants reach full production in the next few years. The European
industry is also more parochial than its US or Japanese rivals, though it is
striving to catch up. BMW and Mercedes are building their first plants in
the US. In China, European carmakers have established an early lead.
Europe is still at an early stage of a huge phase of rationalisation and
restructuring. There are six true volume car makers left: Volkswagen, Fiat,
Renault and Peugeot Citroen, plus Ford and General Motors of the US. Almost
all the smaller players have been absorbed. Though Volvo's merger with
Renault has fallen through, Rover is about to become part of BMW. Among the
big players, at least one further merger looks likely within the next few
years.
The industry is likely to emerge from this phase more competitive than
before. It also has the geographical advantage of a potentially enormous
market on its doorstep, in the form of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
Drugs: The pharmaceutical industry is a European success story. The EU is
the world's biggest producer of prescription drugs, and many of the world's
best-selling drugs have been invented and developed in Europe over the
years. Between 1987 and 1991, EU production grew by 36 per cent in real
terms, compared with 16 per cent for the US. This is also an industry in
which Japan has yet to make its mark.
The chief threat to Europe lies in the rise of biotechnology, which may
supplant much of the traditional chemistry-based drug industry. The US has a
substantial lead here, based largely on its entrepreneurial tradition and
huge pool of venture capital.
Electronics/telecommunications: The picture is mixed. In telecommunications,
Europe has a number of internationally successful equipment suppliers, such
as Siemens, Alcatel, Ericsson and Nokia. It has also struck lucky in mobile
phones, where the European GSM standard is now becoming a global standard
outside the US. This puts US suppliers at a significant disadvantage in an
important growth market.
In electronics, however, Europe is sandwiched between Japan's dominance in
consumer electronics and America's overwhelming strength in high-tech
hardware and software. Unlike the US, Europe has chosen to confront Japan in
consumer electronics, the result being heavy losses for companies such as
Thomson and Philips. Across the high-tech field of computer hardware,
software, semiconductors and micro-processors, Europe as a whole is weak and
risks getting weaker.
Aerospace/defence: Perhaps the EU's biggest industrial success in recent
years has been the establishment of the Airbus consortium as the world's
only real rival to Boeing in civil aircraft manufacture. The financial cost
has been heavy, though, and Airbus's eventual success as an independent
entity cannot be taken for granted.
In the defence industry, European contractors traditionally enjoyed
preferential treatment from their own governments, while the US government
was reluctant to allow sophisticated weaponry into foreign hands. With the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the picture has changed dramatically. Since
1989, US defence exports have risen from Dollars 6bn a year to Dollars 15bn,
while Europe's have halved to around Dollars 5bn. It is not clear that this
process is over. On the other hand, the European industry also lags the US
badly in terms of rationalisation. As in cars, this should make for greater
efficiency, provided it is undertaken in time.
Chemicals: The EU is still by a narrow margin the world's biggest producer
of basic chemicals, just ahead of the US and well ahead of Japan. The threat
comes in petrochemicals, more than half the sector.
Though Europe invented many of the basic plastics, it has some fundamental
handicaps. The US and Middle East have cheaper natural gas as raw material.
The Far East is the main growth market, and Far Eastern producers are
raising capacity accordingly. Several of Europe's leading producers see the
long-term outlook as bleak.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Management: Nothing is forever in business alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We will probably never know exactly what Nobuhiko Kawamoto told the chairman
of BMW in Tokyo on Monday. The disgruntled president of Honda had two main
agenda items: in the wake of BMW's bold purchase of majority control in
Rover three weeks ago, he informed the German car company boss of Honda's
decision to sell its minority stake. And the two men explored the future of
Honda's various joint projects with Rover.
If Kawamoto had been entirely frank and open - which is most unlikely given
the cross-cultural sensitivities involved, and Honda's patent need to
display maximum outrage in order to squeeze higher licensing and other fees
out of Rover - he would have said something like: 'Don't cry for me,
Pischetsrieder.'
The hurt which Honda is suffering is far less than politicians and
commentators of various nationalities have suggested in a spate of emotional
outbursts.
The complainers are right to the extent that breakdowns of the Honda-Rover
kind are rare. Alliances usually end amicably, either in parting, or by one
side acquiring the other. But it is not unknown for one partner to leave the
other in the lurch, either to go it alone or to team up with a rival.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the loser is occasionally Japanese.
Kawasaki drew the short straw two years ago, for instance, when its close
and long-standing collaboration in helicopters with MBB (by then part of
Deutsche Aerospace) ended after the German company created a joint venture,
Eurocopter, with Aerospatiale of France. On a smaller scale, Mazda was
dropped by Ford on a minivan development project, in favour of Nissan.
But in most other senses the tears of the pro-Honda lobby are unwarranted.
Contrary to all the allegations of 'betrayal', there are only two sensible
interpretations of the way Honda allowed Bernd Pischetsrieder and BMW to
steal a march on it.
The less likely, in spite of Honda's display of jilted honour, is that in
its hour of need the Japanese company somehow lost the adroit political
instinct which it has always displayed in the past, in every aspect of its
dealings with business partners and governments.
According to this reading of events, Honda was caught out because it forgot
several fundamental rules for collaborating in the sort of 'strategic
alliance' it has had with Rover. As Jordan Lewis, an American alliance
specialist, says, a key maxim is that 'alliances survive only as long as
each company regards the other as its best partner. So each must take what
steps it can to ensure that the other continues to need it'.
Another rule is that each partner should negotiate an 'exit strategy' at the
beginning of the relationship - and revise it as the years pass  - in case
mutual need disappears, or the shared objectives change.
The second interpretation of events seems far more likely: that Honda
realised precisely what was going on, but that it took a cold business
decision that a majority stake in Rover was either not worth the cost, or
would tie its hands too much in the long run.
According to this reading of events, Honda had its exit route well-prepared.
Unusually for the junior partner in an alliance, Rover certainly did too, by
developing its independent skills in engines and other key areas of the
business.
In stark contrast to the division of opinion among politicians and
journalists, there is a remarkable convergence of views among the academics
and consultants whom I have polled this week.
From vantage points in Italy, France, Washington and California, they all
argue that, even without BMW's intervention, the 15-year-old Honda-Rover
alliance would have come to an end or been scaled back within the next five
years. It was already more than twice the average age of similar
partnerships. This would have happened in one of three ways: through a
complete parting; through Honda's full integration of Rover; or through the
sort of watering down which is now occurring.
As these experts argue, there is a natural life cycle for the sort of
alliances which, as with Honda-Rover, are constructed to give one company
market access and initial production scale in a particular region of the
world, while in return its local partner borrows technology and management
skills - and sometimes also reaps a production benefit.
'For most companies, that's all part of the process of internationalisation
 -such agreements make sense for a while, but not for ever,' says Yves Doz,
an Insead professor who is writing a book on global alliances. 'Eventually,
the partners call it quits, or one takes full control.'
Once the incoming company gains sufficient market access and production
scale to be viable on its own - including through the supply of parts or
complete products from its factories elsewhere in the world - the need for a
regional partner often disappears.
Honda can already meet the first of these conditions, now that it has
decided to continue - at least for a few years - the cross-supply of parts
with Rover. Such a relationship is perfectly normal between rivals these
days in all sorts of industries, including cars.
With local sales from its US production base stagnating, it also meets the
second condition. It has plenty of capacity to supply its UK assembly plant
with parts from the US, even if some of them will have to be redesigned. And
it already exports several complete models from the US to Europe.
So the value of the Rover alliance to Honda was set to decline in any case.
In the words of Joel Bleeke and David Ernst of McKinsey &amp; Co, alliances are
a form of 'arbitrage' in which the value of each partner's contribution
varies over time. In the alliance business, nothing is forever.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Management: Cadbury critique - In London last night Sir Owen
Green, former BTR chairman, delivered the Pall Mall Lecture on UK corporate
governance. The following are edited extracts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is important to recognise that the Cadbury Report (on UK corporate
governance) of 1992 does not have the force of law but that it will have
legal consequences. Our company law concepts and our bases of liability stem
from the fundamental premise of a unitary board. The consequence of an
endeavour to obtain a 'half-way house' between unitary and two-tier boards
must create legal confusion. In the event that the courts are involved in
any issues of governance they will take the (Cadbury) Code as representing
the reasonable requirements of directors.
One questions whether non-executive directors appreciate that their personal
liability may have been substantially increased. Their basic duty of care
and skill would formerly have been governed by the concept of subjective
reasonableness as determined by their personal background and experience.
Executive directors owe a more onerous duty to be judged by objective
reasonableness, irrespective of their personal abilities. The strength of
this distinction may have been diluted, perhaps extinguished, in the case of
members of audit, remuneration and nomination committees whose personal
liability may have been increased.
* * * * *
Cadbury further defines the role of auditors as that of providing the
shareholders with an external and objective check on the directors'
financial statements. It then adds that the framework in which auditors
operate is not well designed to provide objectivity because:
a) Accounting standards currently allow too much scope for presentation and
auditors cannot stand firm against the client's choice of accounting
treatment if that is within permitted standards.
b) Auditors have to work closely with management and will wish to have a
constructive relationship with their clients.
Why might auditors wish to 'stand firm'? If their objection is strong enough
why would they not seek to add a rider to their report? Why are there so
many bodies currently engaged in producing new standards, often additional
and usually controversial? Who are seeking these innovations? Is it the
shareholders in whose interests, mainly if not exclusively, these standards
exist?
Have we not arrived at a point at which the average investor - even the
average analyst - is bemused by a growing complex of figures accompanied by
ever-lengthening notes couched in professional language, supported by a
chairman's report, a chief executive's report, a finance director's
statement, an environmental report and now a corporate governance statement?
As for b), it is indeed sad to read words in which the barely concealed
meaning implies that auditors are hired by managements whose wishes are to
be taken as instructions, provided they do not breach the broad and
versatile accounting standards.
Another feature of the poor framework for objectivity expressed by Cadbury
reads: 'To the extent however that audit firms compete on price and on
meeting the needs of their clients (this must mean the management), this may
be at the expense of meeting the needs of the shareholders.'
These reflections offered by 12 good men and true indicate the level of
general regard to which the auditing profession has fallen.
Shareholders should expect their company's auditors (not the management's
auditors) to challenge the management views where the auditors' principles
are involved and to reject those views where they encourage or condone
management bias against shareholder interests.
An in-depth review of the auditing profession is well overdue. The risk of
confusion of the role of auditor with that of management consultants et al
must be eliminated. Secure the auditor's independence by requiring any
change to be made by a special or extraordinary resolution of the company.
Consider limitation of his liability in certain circumstances. Restore his
role as professional watchdog (but not bloodhound), releasing non-executive
directors to more constructive purposes.
* * * * * * Many people might take the view that the spectacular corporate
failures of recent years, rare as they have been, were more due to the
neglect of requirements of commercial, corporate or common law or inadequacy
of due diligence. The Cadbury recommendations will not eliminate those
hazards or shortcomings.
However, it should be recognised that the talent that can identify, achieve,
or introduce wealth-creating innovation is rare.
Fear of failure, which has often been a strong motivator, can also lead to
reactionary behaviour which fosters regulatory inhibitions which are then
presented as safeguards.
There is danger in an over-emphasis on monitoring; on non-executive
directors' independence from the business of the corporation; on controls
over decision making activities of companies. When coupled with the clearly
reduced status of executives on the governing boards, such requirements must
blunt the competitive edge and deflect the entrepreneurial drive which
characterises participation, let alone success, in a free market.
The emphasis on the special role of the non-executive director has by
definition to be on non-executive matters. In stressing his independent
judgment, his appointment for a specific term, his requirement to review the
performance of the board and the executive, Cadbury casts his role as
chiefly that of a watchdog.
One only has to read the media reaction to corporate failures of recent
years and months to accept that the general expectation of these
appointments is as watchdogs and it will be the most human of consequences
that the watchdog role will be predominant.
The fading reality of a unitary board will be further diluted by continuing
emphasis on the distinctive roles of non-executives in governance. In that
event the introduction, de facto, of the upper tier Teutonic shield of the
great and the good will not be long delayed.
What an irony it would be if the behaviour of non-executive directors under
the influence of some of the Cadbury proposals succeeds in persuading
executives of the advantage of such a change.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Buds of May rail link plan opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposal to route the fast rail link to the Channel tunnel through
unspoiled countryside west of Ashford in Kent yesterday prompted the threat
of legal action from angry local residents.
The Mayday action group said it would be the first legal challenge to the
rail route.
The line at Ashford is one of two short sections of the rail link that were
not finally decided by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, when he
announced the route last month. Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary
that is drawing up plans for the link, announced three possible routes late
on Wednesday.
The most southerly of the suggested routes would cut through countryside
which featured in The Darling Buds of May television series, adapted from
the HE Bates novel.
The government's preferred route would take the link to the north of the
town. Ashford council is in favour of one of two routes that would take the
link through a new international station being built in the centre of town.
A middle route, which was originally rejected because it involved a Pounds
60m tunnel, has become a more likely choice because the Ministry of Defence
has freed land to allow it to run at ground level with only a short tunnel.
Union Railways plans to unveil its options for the second undecided section,
at Pepper Hill near Gravesend, on March 10.
Planning directions that safeguard the route of the Channel rail link and
trigger the procedure for blighted homes to be bought by British Rail come
into effect today.
This means that anyone seeking planning permission to carry out work on the
safeguarded route must obtain the approval of Union Railways.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Property: A health warning - Vanessa Houlder on a report
that calls for improved management of property holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relaxed approach to property characteristic of many British boards has
given way to a more hard-headed consensus: bad property management can
damage a company's competitiveness.
This sea-change in corporate attitudes is underlined by a study of finance
directors' views on property, conducted by consultants Graham Bannock &amp;
Partners for Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
'Many UK companies have only begun to think about the true economic cost of
their property assets in the last few years,' says the report, published
this week. 'Few companies will be able to neglect the scope for cost savings
and enhanced risk-control strategies in this field.'
The reasons behind this shift in attitude include changing economic
conditions, increased competition, the effects of the UK recession and
heightened awareness of the potential risks associated with property.
For the three decades after the second world war, corporate planners
attached little importance to property. Companies were willing to buy their
premises, as low interest rates encouraged borrowing, and they benefited
from rising real property values.
By the 1970s, the rise in real values meant that many companies owned
valuable freehold property in top locations. Moreover, property ownership
fitted in with the trend favouring a diversified portfolio of products and
services.
But in the past 20 years attitudes have again begun to swing. Companies have
increasingly seen their property holdings as 'a mis-allocation of scarce
resources rather than a solid bulwark of support', the report says.
The increase in real property values has slowed since the 1970s. An
increasingly competitive business climate forced companies to specialise in
a narrow range of core activities, which generally excluded property
investment.
This more focused approach added weight to the argument that cash locked up
in property assets should be released. 'If the rate of return on the
company's assets exceeds the expected appreciation of property assets, the
latter should be sold and the money invested in the business,' says the
report.
The recession has sharply increased awareness of the potential risks
associated with property. First, the problems of many financially-strapped
companies were compounded because they occupied properties with long-term
leases and therefore could do little to cut their rental costs. Second,
companies were hit by 'privity of contract'  - they were liable for the rent
on buildings they had vacated, even if they had passed on their lease to a
tenant that had defaulted. Third, companies that owned freeholds were badly
affected by the downturn, as banks cut credit for companies with loans
secured on tangible assets.
Besides market changes, new accounting rules have also forced finance
directors to reassess the real economic costs of their property assets.
These rule changes include the requirement for more consistency in how fixed
assets are represented on a balance sheet.
Companies are also becoming more aware of the scope to raise profitability
and returns on property assets. In a survey of 111 companies in the report,
26 per cent said there was 'considerable scope' for reducing property costs.
The rewards of tighter property management, the report says, are
considerable. Success depends on a business's net profit margins. When net
margins are only about 7 per cent, a reduction in costs of, say, 0.65 per
cent due to better control of property overheads translates into an earnings
rise per share of about 10 per cent.
The scope for improving property management varies between different
companies. The best-run portfolios are those belonging to companies for
which property is an integral part of their core business, such as banks and
hotels.
Another group of companies which tends not to be too concerned about its
property costs are those operating on high net profit margins - such as the
pharmaceutical industry - or companies where property assets are small in
relation to the balance sheet - as in financial services groups.
The companies that have the greatest need to address their property costs
are those in mature industries. Such companies trade on smaller profit
margins and have the widest scope for rationalisation. Moreover, they often
have a complex property portfolio as a result of re-organisations, mergers
and rationalisation.
The report says that improving property management is not easy. Companies
may wish for greater flexibility in their leases, but they may be stymied by
landlords anxious to retain long leases.
Companies operating in a low-inflation and competitive climate will continue
to be under pressure to cut overheads. Those with over-extended portfolios
have little choice but to get to grips with their property costs.

FT  25 FEB 94 / CBI forecast trims hopes for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers saw the best improvement in order books for four years in
February, but have lowered their expectations for economic expansion.
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday joined most other economic
forecasters in predicting that the economy was poised for only modest growth
 -2.3 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent next year.
The CBI said the downward revisions from last November's forecasts - 2.4 per
cent and 2.8 per cent respectively - reflected the expected impact of tax
rises and cuts in public spending in the next two years.
Meanwhile, its latest industrial trends survey showed that the net
proportion of companies assessing order books as below normal is the least
negative since September 1989. Some 19 per cent reported their books to be
above normal, while 30 per cent said they were below. The negative balance
of 11 per cent compares favourably with negative balances of 21 per cent and
36 per cent in January and February last year.
Export order books are also significantly better than they were a year ago,
although there has been no improvement since December, suggesting a rise in
home demand.
The survey, carried out between January 24 and February 16, covered 1,360 of
the UK's biggest manufacturers, which account for about half of manufactured
exports.
It shows that slightly more companies expect to increase domestic prices in
the next four months than to reduce them. The CBI expects inflation to reach
3.1 per cent by the end of this year and 3.7 per cent by the end of next
year. The underlying measure - which excludes mortgage interest payments -
will stay within the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range, but
nearer to the top end.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director, said: 'Last November's
Budget introduced a more restrictive stance on personal taxation than we had
previously anticipated. This has contributed to our downward revision of
growth in national output.'
He added that the tax changes had altered the composition of economic
growth. Consumer spending was now expected to rise moderately this year and
next, but this would depend on individuals running down their savings to
offset the slow growth in take-home pay.
The CBI expects the balance of payments to stay flat this year at about
Pounds 9.7bn - compared with Pounds 9.5bn last year - as recovery in
continental Europe leads to a rise in exports. Unemployment will fall only
slowly.
It stressed that a big risk to the forecasts was uncertainty about the way
in which the economy was likely to respond to the spring tax rises. Although
the forecast assumes that consumer spending will continue to rise, the CBI
pointed out that consumers could turn out to be more cautious than expected.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Moves to help women gain top science posts urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should set a target of filling 25 per cent of its senior
scientific posts with women by the year 2000, an independent advisory
committee said yesterday. At present women make up about 12 per cent of such
appointments.
The Committee on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology was set up
last year by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for science. It has put
forward recommendations with the aim of encouraging more girls to study
science at school and then helping them to gain careers in research.
The proposals range from broadening the secondary school curriculum to
making research grants more flexible so that women scientists can work
part-time when they have family commitments.
According to the committee's report, few women scientists get top scientific
jobs. Only 118 of 917 people serving on government committees in
science-related fields - and six of the 95 members of the councils that
award research grants - are women.
Members of the committee said the most important single recommendation was
that the government should set up a development unit within Mr Waldegrave's
Office of Science and Technology with the specific aim of promoting women's
interests.
'If the development unit is not set up, we're sunk,' said Professor Patricia
Clarke of University College, London.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Property: IPD Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth in commercial property capital values fell from 2.9 per cent in
December to 1.2 per cent in January, according to the Investment Property
Databank, a research group, writes Vanessa Houlder.
Total returns from commercial property remained strongly positive at 1.9 per
cent.
The rate of decline in rental values in January was unchanged from December,
at -0.3 per cent. No sector or region shows clear signs of an upturn in
rental values.
Total returns slowed across all sectors. Industrials and retails both
returned 2.1 per cent for the month, while offices fell back into third
place with a total return of 1.7 per cent.
Total returns for offices in January fell to 1.7 per cent on the back of a
fall in capital growth to less than 1 per cent. Equivalent yields in the
industrial sector shortened from 10.5 per cent in December to 10.3 per cent
in January. Total returns and capital growth of the industrial sector were
2.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.
Six new funds have been added to the IPD monthly index in January,
increasing its total capital value by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.14bn.
The monthly IPD charts of quarterly returns are no longer adjusted to show
annualised movements. This is to prevent a strong short-term performance
from giving an unrealistically high impression of achievable returns.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Tupe 'applies to one-person task'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contracting-out of services performed by just one employee is covered by
the European Union's transfer of undertakings rules, according to a
preliminary opinion of the European Court of Justice.
The opinion of Advocate General Walter Van Gerven in the Schmidt case - that
the European Acquired Rights Directive can apply to the contracting-out of
cleaning services performed by one cleaner - has significant implications
for the UK government's flagship policy on the contracting-out of
public-sector services.
The directive, which was translated into UK law by the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known by the
acronym Tupe, protects the jobs and conditions of employees when the
undertaking they work for changes hands.
New employers must take over all existing contracts of employment, consult
with unions and honour collective agreements.
Confusion over whether Tupe applied to contracting-out has thrown the
government's compulsory competitive tendering and market-testing programmes
into confusion.
The advocate general's opinion follows the approach taken by the European
Court in an earlier case involving the contracting-out by Philips, the Dutch
electronics company, of a staff canteen. But the court said whether the
transfer rules applied to a particular service was a question for national
courts.
Mr Van Gerven said cleaning services were an economic activity to which the
directive applied and the fact that an activity was carried out by only one
person did not prevent the rules applying.
He reiterated that for there to be a transfer the service had to form an
indentifiable 'economic entity' which existed either independently or as
part of a greater organisation.
Although the advocate general's opinion is not binding on the court it is
likely to be followed by the European judges when they come to deliver their
judgment in the summer.
Contractors said yesterday they were becoming resigned to the idea that Tupe
was capable of broad application to contracting-out.
In August last year the English Employment Appeal Tribunal caused fresh
confusion by upholding an industrial tribunal ruling that there was no
transfer when the contract for cleaning Orsett Hospital in Essex came to an
end and a new contract was awarded to a different contractor. This decision,
which contradicts the approach taken by the European Court, will be heard by
the Court of Appeal in June.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Lack of consensus plagues councils shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's attempt to re-draw the map of English local government on
the back of consensus by local politicians looks certain to fail.
In at least nine counties - Cheshire, Cumbria, Essex, Hampshire, Kent,
Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Suffolk and West Sussex - county councillors
are refusing to agree to abandon the two-tier system of districts and
counties, while district councils want the areas to be carved into
all-purpose 'unitary' authorities.
Pressure from local Conservative MPs could be critical to the outcome in
these areas.
Consensus has been reached on some significant changes. Several cities and
large towns - including Brighton and Hove, Leicester, Milton Keynes,
Stoke-on-Trent and Plymouth - seem certain to become all-purpose
authorities, in a return to the status many once enjoyed as county boroughs.
Several counties - including Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Cambridgeshire,
Dorset, Hertfordshire and Shropshire - also seem certain to abandon the
two-tier structure, although there is still room for disagreement over the
shape of the new unitary authorities.
But the failure of many areas to reach any agreement is bad news for the
government, which aims to set up new authorities for 30 per cent of rural
England by May next year, with the rest to follow in May 1996.
It believes this can only be done if councils present consensus plans to the
Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, changed his guidance to Sir John
last September after his plans for the first tranche of counties had met
with fierce criticism from local interest groups. The commission is now to
give priority to locally agreed proposals.
If no agreement can be thrashed out locally the commission and the
government will be left to impose one.
The Association of District Councils supports the government's preferred
position of creating unitary bodies, and has urged its members to agree
mergers. Districts are doing so, although in most counties they are keeping
the number of mergers to a minimum.
The Association of County Councils initially objected to altering the
two-tier structure and now recommends its members to look for new unitary
councils that are as large as possible.
Even counties that are volunteering to split into unitary bodies find
themselves in dispute with local districts. Cambridgeshire, for example, is
in favour of two unitaries, while the districts want five.
Oxfordshire hopes to become one large unitary county, with more power
devolved to towns and parishes, while similar proposals are being explored
by Surrey, where districts have announced plans for five or six unitary
bodies.
Disputes are becoming increasingly acrimonious, with both sets of
authorities accusing their rivals of overspending on publicity and
propaganda. Huntingdonshire District Council and Kent and Surrey county
councils have been accused by local rivals of spending too much on local
'information campaigns'.
Big cities have the strongest case for unitary status, as metropolitan
authorities in London, the West Midlands, South and West Yorkshire and
Manchester and Merseyside are already unitary. Several counties therefore
seem content to allow cities to become unitary, but to keep the rest of the
area unchanged.
Devon is likely to allow Plymouth to become unitary, but will probably call
for a continued two-tier structure for the rest of the county. Staffordshire
and Leicestershire are likely to make similar proposals for Stoke-on-Trent
and Leicester.
Yet districts are unlikely to concur with 'doughnut' agreements, and in
Devon they strongly support creating six new unitary authorities.
In Wiltshire, Thamesdown District Council, which includes Swindon, is likely
to become unitary, while Bournemouth, Luton and Bedford also seem certain to
be part of unitary structures.
But Hampshire is holding out against even a 'doughnut' arrangement and wants
Portsmouth and Southampton to stay within the two-tier system for the rest
of the county.
Support is growing among several counties and a few districts, such as
Congleton in Cheshire, for compromising by reforming the two-tier structure
to remove anomalies and transfer some powers to the districts. The argument
is that this could achieve many of the benefits of reorganisation without
the costs and confusion.
The ACC's vice-chair, Ms Josie Farrington, believes that this could be
achieved within the commission's legal framework. But Mr David Curry, the
local government minister, believes improvements to the two-tier system are
disallowed by the legislation which framed the review.
The ADC strongly backs Mr Curry. Mrs Margaret Singh, the chairman, said
'minor grace and favour' concessions from the counties would be
unacceptable.
With compromises hard to find, the government may soon be in the position it
wanted most to avoid - arbiter of an increasingly heated struggle between
entrenched interests.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's airports are set for a surge in demand for air travel, according
to government forecasts published yesterday, Rachel Johnson writes.
Demand will grow faster at regional airports than London airports, and
business traffic will outpace leisure traffic.
The Department of Transport predicted that air traffic at London and
regional airports is to grow by up to 163 per cent between 1992 and the year
2010 - an annual rate of between 3.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent - provided
there are no constraints from shortages of airport or airspace capacity.
According to the estimates the number of domestic and international
passengers will rise to between 279.5m by 2010, from 106.1m in 1992.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Broker urges cut in whisky output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cut in Scotch whisky production of between 5 per cent and 7 1/2 per cent
this year is needed to reduce a damaging surplus of stock, says a report
published today.
It says output must fall for the fourth consecutive year, although the
reduction need not be as severe as the 15 per cent cut made in 1993. Mr Alan
Gray, the report's author, expects this cut to bring stocks largely into
line with consumption, although production will need to be held at the lower
level through 1995. Mr Gray is a whisky analyst with Sutherland &amp; Partners,
the Edinburgh securities house.
Whisky distillers have been hit by falling demand for four years, but the
market recovered slightly last year, and further improvement is expected
this year. Sutherland says whisky exports increased last year in spite of
recession in many overseas markets, with exports of Bottled in Scotland
blends up 2.7 per cent by the end of November.
Total exports were more than Pounds 2bn for the first time, maintaining
Scotch whisky's position as one of the UK's most important exports.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Tecs attack budget scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government initiative that aims to improve local regeneration schemes has
been criticised by training and enterprise councils as a 'missed
opportunity' for business and job creation.
Employer-led Tecs are among several organisations, including local
authorities, that will be encouraged to bid for the new Single Regeneration
Budget (SRB) which will, from April, replace 20 separate economic
regeneration programmes at present run by five government departments.
Tecs, which administer government training programmes in England and Wales,
have the additional responsibility of spearheading local economic
development. A large part of their economic development budgets will be
subsumed by the new SRB.
Tecs fear that in spite of the different budgets being pulled together into
the SRB, the focus of most of the programmes will remain that of alleviating
deprivation, especially physical and social problems in inner cities. Mr
Edward Roberts, chairman of the Tec National Council, said yesterday: 'While
we accept that improving the physical environment helps to facilitate
growth, we are urging the government to change its draft SRB proposals to
place much greater emphasis on increasing competitiveness, business growth
and skills, and on the physical developments which will support this.'
Strict guidance for SRB bids has been drafted by the government and this has
caused some conflict with Tecs.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Covent Garden scheme revised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera House in Covent Garden has dropped proposals to help fund
its redevelopment by building commercial offices, according to new plans
unveiled yesterday.
The new scheme, drawn up by Stanhope Properties, depends on securing cash
from the Millennium Fund from the National Lottery, and from public appeal.
It involves modernising the stage facilities, providing more seats,
restoring the adjacent Floral Hall building and giving the Royal Ballet a
home at Covent Garden.
The opera house won planning consent in 1990 for a scheme which incorporated
commercial office and retail space. This proposal was criticised by
conservationists and became less commercially attractive as a result of the
decline in the property market. A review of the scheme found that if the
office space were removed it would not be necessary to have deep basements
and the project would take less time and money.
If the new plan is approved by Westminster City Council and funding is
available, the opera house is expected to close in 1997 and reopen by the
year 2000.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Labour pledged to mixed economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith yesterday committed a future Labour government to a mixed
economy by proposing a new partnership between the public and private
sectors.
The Labour leader used a symposium on public and private finance to replace
the party's traditional support for nationalisation and public ownership
with a pledge to marry the private and public sector.
He said: 'We can transcend the old battle lines and the old dogmas that have
held our country and our people back.
'As well as continuing to own and to employ directly, government must take
on a new role, as partner and co-ordinator, working with the private sector
to secure investment and bring together the best of the public-service ethos
and the strengths of private capital and entrepreneurial sprit.'
Mr Smith's new policy came under fire both from both leftwingers in his
party and from the government.
Ms Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington and a
member of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, questioned how
the new partnership would work when the important objective should be
increasing employment.
Ms Abbott said: 'The private sector wants to take all of the profit and none
of the risk.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, welcomed Labour's 'conversion' after
insisting that public service should go hand in hand with public provision.
He said: 'Fifteen years after the government stamped on its tail, the
message has reached the dinosaur's brain. It is time to move. It's new to
Labour, but it has represented mainstream government thinking for more than
a decade.'
Mr Smith, who dismissed the fears of leftwingers in his party, accused the
government of being blind to the opportunities of working towards a genuine
partnership.
He blamed the government's insistence that the Channel tunnel should be
privately financed as an example of a delay in the project due to ideology.
'In Britain we don't even have a starting date for the link to London while
on the French side the rail link has already been completed,' the Labour
leader said. This was a wholly unnecessary price to pay for dogma and such a
project was ready-made for public and private collaboration, he said.
Mr Smith said Labour wanted most leading public utilities kept in the public
sector but where possible there would be private-sector participation.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Council tax expected to rise less than inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Council tax could rise by less than inflation this year, a survey of 67
councils shows.
Public Finance, the journal of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, today publishes findings which show that in 67 councils to have
set a figure the average band D council tax will rise 1.1 per cent - by
Pounds 6.16 to Pounds 561.57.
The demands made by county councils as their share from council tax have
risen an average 6.6 per cent, according to Cipfa.
Only three counties are predicted to set budgets below the government's
capping limits. Changes in central government grant are blamed.
Cuts are most likely in London boroughs and metropolitan districts, because
of changes in the tax base and the cushioning effects of the grants that the
government has made to compensate for changes to the formula which
determines local authority funding. Conservative-controlled Bromley is
reducing its council tax by 7.5 per cent with no cut in services. Liberal
Democrat-controlled Tower Hamlets will leave its tax unchanged.
The biggest increase so far proposed is for Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales, where
band D tax will increase 20.9 per cent, from Pounds 282.09 to Pounds 341.60.
In Northampton it will rise 14.3 per cent. The highest band D figure is
Salford's Pounds 740.
Wandsworth, the Conservative flagship borough in south London, has the
lowest council tax at Pounds 139 - down from last year's Pounds 146.
The council admitted it had benefited from transitional relief paid to
individuals to guard against big increases compared to the former community
charge, but said it had the second lowest needs-related support from the
government of any inner-London borough.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Directors warned on legal liabilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-executive directors of UK companies may not appreciate that their
personal legal liability 'may have substantially increased', a senior
British industrialist warned last night.
Sir Owen Green, recently retired chairman of the industrial conglomerate
BTR, told an audience in London that the 1992 Cadbury report on corporate
governance does not have the force of law, but 'it will have legal
consequences'.
Sir Owen explained that its attempt to create what he called a 'half-way
house' between unitary and two-tier boards 'must create legal confusion'. In
the event that the courts are involved in any issues of governance 'they
will take the (Cadbury) code as representing the reasonable requirements of
directors'.
The strength of the old legal distinction between executive and
non-executive directors may have been diluted, perhaps extinguished, in the
case of members of audit, remuneration and nomination committees.
In setting out his personal corporate governance vision - at odds in many
respects with the Cadbury approach - Sir Owen strongly criticised the role
of auditors and renewed his earlier attack on excessive executive pay.
He said a review of the auditing profession was 'well overdue' and that
auditors' independence from company managements must be restored. This could
be done by making any change in auditors subject to a special or
extraordinary meeting, while limited liability should also be considered.
'Restore his role as professional watchdog - but not bloodhound,' he said.
On pay, Sir Owen called for disclosure of all benefits of high-paid
executives. 'The Cadbury suggestion of remuneration committees of
non-executive directors is demonstrably not a solution.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Big investors urged to be active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One in five of the 250 largest UK-quoted companies meet all important
criteria of best practice in corporate governance and 75 per cent meet most
of them, says a report by the National Association of Pension Funds' Voting
Issues Service after its first year of operation.
That was described as 'encouraging' yesterday by Mr Angus Matheson, retiring
chairman of the NAPF investment committee, at the association's investment
conference in Eastbourne.
Speakers called for active voting by institutional investors, for the
revival of the role of the annual meeting, and proposed attacks on the
management of poorly performing companies.
The Voting Issues Service monitors the 250 companies for controversial
proposals requiring shareholder approval. It supplies details to more than
60 fund-management firms running portfolios worth some Pounds 200bn in
aggregate.
It also tests against a check-list of eight corporate-governance criteria,
including division of the roles of chairman and chief executive, presence of
three or more non-executive directors, and the existence of remuneration and
audit committees of the board.
Mr Matheson told delegates that the service had been well-received but
institutional owners of shares should go further and exercise voting rights.
Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, the newly listed fund management
group, said there was further to go in improving corporate governance.
Non-executive directors were important but selection was capricious,
training virtually non-existent and the job definition vague in the extreme.
The pool from which non-executive directors were drawn should be widened, he
said.
Mr Myners also recommended the resuscitation of the annual meeting. 'The
opportunity exists for a far-sighted chairman to restore the annual meeting
to its rightful place as the nexus of shareholder and management contact,'
he said.
Mr Dale Hanson, chief executive officer of the Dollars 82bn Californian
public-sector pensions system, Calpers, and veteran of many US proxy
battles, told delegates that institutional investors must be active in
pursuing the boards of under-performing companies. 'We are going to remind
the world that shareholders are the owners,' he said. 'We will be targeting
10 companies this year.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Shareholders 'must see option scheme benefit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executive share option schemes must be perceived to offer something to
shareholders as well as to managers, National Association of Pension Funds
delegates were told yesterday, Barry Riley writes.
Last month the association controversially expressed 'strong disapproval' of
the share option scheme since implemented by the investment group M&amp;G. Mr
Angus Matheson, the association's investment committee chairman, yesterday
praised the 'efforts and ingenuity' of several big companies such as Reuters
and Grand Metropolitan in framing their more complex proposals.
Instead of schemes linked simply to the share price - such as the M&amp;G
arrangement - institutional shareholders are now expecting companies to
relate the options to some more sophisticated measure of corporate
performance, such as beating an index.
The association, along with the Association of British Insurers, has for
some time been pressing for executive share options to be subject to
shareholder-oriented guidelines.
But Mr Matheson said that, judging by the responses by companies to the
association's consultative document on the subject, corporate respondees'
level of understanding of share schemes was 'disappointing to say the
least'.
Mr Geoff Lindey, who is about to become investment committee chairman, said
the decision on an appropriate performance yardstick was up to the company.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Lloyd's agency to be closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hogg Group, the insurance broker, yesterday placed KC Webb (Underwriting),
one of its Lloyd's members' agency subsidiaries, into creditors' voluntary
liquidation.
Like its rival broker, JIB Group, which liquidated the Christand agency
earlier this month, Hogg said it was concerned about the size of contingent
claims faced by the agency after the failure on February 14 of the insurance
market's Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer.
The rejection of the deal means that a series of cases by loss-making Names,
the individuals whose assets support the market, are expected to go ahead.
Hearings in a case by about 350 Pulbrook Names against their agents started
in the High Court yesterday, the first case covered by the offer to come to
court.
Mr Anthony Howland Jackson, chairman of Hogg, said the decision did not
affect the right of Names to make claims against the company and that its
errors and omissions insurance - covering agents against the cost of legal
awards - remained intact.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Barry docklands scheme launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 20m scheme to redevelop derelict docklands at Barry, south Wales,
was launched yesterday in an attempt to regenerate what was once the world's
busiest coal port, Roland Adburgham writes.
Planning consent is being sought for housing, shops, business premises and
leisure facilities on 180 acres of land which was formerly rail marshalling
yards.
The scheme is a joint initiative by Associated British Ports and the Welsh
Development Agency.
The photograph above - taken in 1936 - shows holidaymakers watching steamers
passing through Barry Docks.
Site clearance has already started, and an access road linking the docks
with the town is being built by Vale of Glamorgan District Council.
Next month a separate initiative to regenerate the town itself will be
launched by the council, South Glamorgan County Council and the WDA.
The deepwater port opened in 1889 with a railway line connecting it to the
Rhondda coal mines. Within a decade a town of nearly 30,000 people had grown
up, only 10,000 fewer than the present population.

FT  25 FEB 94 / SIB plans split of safety funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial services companies will no longer have to bail out companies in
other sectors of the industry that are unable to meet their liabilities to
investors, under new arrangements published yesterday by the City's chief
watchdog.
The proposals from the Securities and Investments Board will mean an end to
present arrangements for the investors' compensation scheme, under which
costs - up to a liability of Pounds 100m a year - are met by a levy on all
the firms which are members of the self-regulating organ-isations.
The ICS offers a safety net for investors who are entitled to redress but
find that the firm responsible for their predicament has gone out of
business.
The paper underlines SIB's aim of withdrawing from direct regulation of
firms. It says that those firms which it does regulate will be treated for
the purposes of the compensation scheme as though they belonged to the
appropriate self-regulating organisation.
Since this decision was the most controversial of the proposals, it offers
further evidence that SIB is determined that even firms that are not
enthusiastic should have as little choice as possible about joining the new
regulator for retail financial services, the Personal Investment Authority.
Cross-contribution has been a contentious issue in the industry. Under the
new ICS arrangements each self-contained fund will have a limit of Pounds
100m for its potential liability to claims.
Assuming the PIA comes into existence there will be three funds, one for PIA
members, one for members of Imro, the self-regulating organisation for the
fund-management industry, and one for the Securities and Futures Authority,
the self-regulating body for private-client stockbrokers.
The date for the introduction of the new 'stand-alone' funds will depend on
when the PIA becomes operational, which is expected to be in mid-July.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Auditors press for liability changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest accountancy firms yesterday warned of higher audit fees
and a more restrictive service if the law on audit liability was not
reformed.
In a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry made public
yesterday, they urged the government to change the law to allow them to
limit their liability with companies.
The firms say that without such a change they would be reluctant to provide
assurances on forward-looking financial data, or to comment on internal
controls and other proposals in the Cadbury code of corporate governance.
The submission, given to officials on Tuesday, responds to a number of
questions from DTI officials since a meeting held between the firms and Mr
Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs, last July.
It says the number of writs outstanding against the six largest accountants
last year was 627, compared with just three writs a decade ago. Premiums
have risen by 37.5 times in the same period and deductibles - the amount
paid by the firms before triggering any payment from commercial insurers -
by 27 times to Dollars 45m.
Other information prepared by Minet, insurance broker to the firms, says
that the average of the three largest claims was Pounds 500m last year, the
average of the five largest was Pounds 350m and of the 10 largest Pounds
250m. These figures exclude the outstanding writs seeking more than Dollars
8bn in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
They have risen sharply in the past few years to well in excess of the upper
level of commercial insurance cover, which stands at Dollars 105m.
A subcommittee of three of the firms' senior partners has been meeting to
discuss the subject every two weeks, and Ian Greer Associates, a political
lobbyist has been hired to help promote the case.
The firms want removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which
expressly forbids them from negotiating any upper limit on their liability
in audits.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Tory MPs reject compromise on student unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The education bill, a key part of the government's Back to Basics campaign,
appeared to be in deep trouble last night after backbench Conservative
critics rejected compromise proposals on student unions.
The bill has been stalled in the Lords since its second reading in early
January, when peers on all sides objected to provisions giving the
government powers to impose strict restrictions on the activities of student
unions.
A group of prominent Conservative education specialists in the Commons made
clear, however, that they would oppose the bill unless it was amended to
make membership of student unions voluntary.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday offered the two sets of
critics a compromise which would ensure that student unions remained broadly
independent, while abolishing regulations making membership compulsory.
Announcing the revised proposals in the Lords, Baroness Blatch, the junior
education minister, said the government would replace its proposed power to
direct student unions with provisions for a code of practice, including
rights for students to opt out.
The compromise was welcomed by vice-chancellors, who had campaigned strongly
to keep student unions free from what many regarded as a government
takeover.
Mr Ted Nield, spokesman for the committee of vice-chancellors and
principals, said it followed 'very constructive' talks with Lady Blatch and
other ministers.
The rebels in the Commons accused the government of pandering to the
higher-education establishment, and demanded further changes.
Mr Graham Riddick, a parliamentary private secretary who has long campaigned
against compulsory membership, said the proposals would leave unions in the
hands of extremists, and expose students who opted out to victimisation.
He said: 'Clearly the bill will have to be beefed up when it reaches the
Commons.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the compromise as 'an
embarrassing climbdown'.

FT  25 FEB 94 / City banker found guilty of Pounds 100m fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the former City merchant banker, was yesterday
convicted at the Old Bailey of a sophisticated Pounds 100m fraud on a number
of financial institutions in an attempt to prop up the bank he had
established and run.
His conviction came at the end of a three-month trial thought to have cost
more than Pounds 3m. The Serious Fraud Office brought the prosecution after
the collapse in 1991 of Mr Smith's bank, the Wallace Smith Trust Company,
with losses of Pounds 100m.
After deliberating overnight the jury returned guilty verdicts on one
general count of fraudulent trading involving Pounds 100m and two specific
counts of obtaining property by deception. The jury cleared Mr Smith of
three counts of theft. The judge also directed not guilty verdicts on two
false accounting charges. Mr Smith will be sentenced on March 23 and has
been released on conditional bail.
Wallace Smith Trust Company began to run into serious financial problems in
1990. The court heard that to cover its increasing losses Mr Smith, the
chairman and joint managing director, embarked on a series of frauds on
banks and other financial institutions. This was made possible by the highly
centralised and autocratic manner in which he ran his business. At the heart
of the fraud was the practice of 'double-dipping' - using and re-using
certificates of deposit to obtain a series of multi-million pound loans.
To avoid detection Mr Smith laundered the money by routing it out of the UK
into two shell companies in Canada. The money was then returned to the UK
and Mr Smith's bank by charging management fees to the Canadian companies.
Mr Smith told others at Wallace Smith Trust that the two Canadian companies,
based in Edmonton, Alberta, had substantial assets in the form of land, oil
and gas interests along with a wide-ranging portfolio of shares. Both
companies were complete shams. They had no assets, employed no staff and
operated out of one-room offices.
To enable the scheme to work Mr Smith appointed as short-term directors of
these companies accountants who were more interested in travelling the world
than following City careers. They worked in London offices separate to the
main bank and followed Mr Smith's instructions, signing documents as
required.
One former director told the court how Mr Smith had ordered him neither to
discuss the business of the Canadian company with anyone from Wallace Smith
Trust Company nor to acknowledge Mr Smith if the two men met in public.
The scheme deceived both Bank of England supervisors and the bank's
auditors, Deloitte Haskin &amp; Sells, now part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
By late 1990 senior staff with the bank were starting to challenge Mr Smith
about his methods. However, Mr Smith fended off their inquiries and in April
1991 committed his largest single fraud, cheating the Discount Bank and
Trust Company of Dollars 37m (Pounds 25m) by entering into 'repo'
transactions with it using Canadian bonds that never existed.
This prompted further inquiries from bank staff. Mr Michael Hamilton, a
joint managing director, challenged Mr Smith to prove the existence of the
bonds. When he was unable to do so, he forced him to call in the Bank of
England. Within two days the bank was liquidated with debts of Pounds 100m
and Mr Smith arrested.
Mr Smith - who once provided considerable financial support to the Bruges
Group of anti-European MPs - was said in court to have no personal assets
left.
Last night Labour MP Mr Peter Hain demanded that the Bruges Group returned
the money it had received from Wallace Smith. He said: 'They should be
required to pay it back. This is stolen money.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Labour warns on quango abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour government would impose financial penalties on members of unelected
public boards which misused taxpayers' money, Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's
Citizen's Charter spokesman, told the Commons last night.
Launching an attack on the growth of unelected state bodies, he said their
number had grown 'dramatically' during the past 15 years.
Mr Meacher condemned the expansion of government patronage and said that the
number of valuable contracts being awarded to companies which made large
contributions to Conservative party funds was more than a coincidence.
His charges were rejected by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible
for the Citizen's Charter, who said there had been a 36 per cent fall in the
number of non-departmental bodies since the Conservatives had returned to
power in 1979.
Appointments to such bodies were made on the basis of qualifications
regardless of party affiliations, he said.
Mr Meacher said a Labour government would transfer a number of the functions
now discharged by quangos - quasi-non-governmental organisations - to
elected authorities.
Members of the remaining quangos would be subject to the same 'surcharge
discipline' that applied to elected members of local authorities, and be
exposed to a tighter system of public supervision.
A Labour motion condemning the rapid growth in expenditure by quangos and
alleging it had been accompanied by 'increased fraud and waste' was defeated
by a government majority of 45 (308-263).
A government amendment noting that the increased powers and independence
given to the comptroller and auditor general had led to more effective
control of fraud and waste was approved by a majority of 61 (306-245).

FT  25 FEB 94 / Rules set for price-sensitive data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange yesterday released guidance for companies to use in
communicating price-sensitive information to the marketplace, intended to
aid compliance with the insider-trading rules in the new Criminal Justice
Act.
The rules take effect next week.
The exchange said it would discuss with the Treasury a more specific
definition of what constitutes creating a 'false market' for share dealing,
because market participants believe the current definition is too broad and
vague.
The guidance was developed by the exchange and a panel that included
representatives of shareholder groups, securities analysts and the 100 Group
of finance directors.
Mr Martin Hall, the exchange's director of policy, said: 'This is not a
clampdown of information. It is intended to improve the flow of information
into the market.'
Mr Hall said the panel took the view that the faster price-sensitive
information was made available to the marketplace, the less the opportunity
for insider dealing.
He said the exchange did not intend to take steps to see to it that
companies followed the guidance. 'We are not obliging people to observe
this,' he said. The exchange hoped that 'people should observe the spirit of
this and it should not be seen as a bonanza to lawyers'.
The panel stopped short of forming a definition of what constituted
price-sensitive information, saying that it would have to include too many
variables to come up with a consistent standard.
The panel also considered, but rejected, suggestions that companies be
required to issue quarterly trading statements similar to those required in
the US. Mr Hall said: 'It is not part of our scheme of things to present a
push towards quarterly reporting. There was very strong resistance to
another formal regulatory burden.'
Companies are, however, urged to make statements about trading conditions at
regular intervals.
The exchange clarified what a company's obligation is to analysts who make
forecasts about profits. There is no obligation to tell individual analysts
that their forecast is wrong and if companies do so they must immediately
inform the markets generally. An analyst hearing such a forecast is required
to inform the Stock Exchange which, in turn, will ask the company to make a
statement.
Companies ought, however, to make public announcements quickly when they
realise their own forecasts of sales or profits are misleading.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                             MAIN POINTS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Companies should have a consistent procedure for determining what
information is sufficiently significant for it to be price-sensitive
and for releasing that information
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Companies should consider making their internal communications
policies known publicly
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Companies should make arrangements to keep price-sensitive information
confidential until it is announced, and must not allow this information
to leak
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Companies are urged to have a structured communications plan with
regular updates on their trading position and immediate prospects
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Where companies issue lengthy releases either to shareholders or to the
market as a whole which include comments or future trading prospects,
this information should be given due prominence
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
A holding announcement should be used where a company and its advisers
believe that there is a danger of information about an unexpected or
significant event leaking where the facts cannot be confirmed
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
If price-sensitive information is inadvertently released a company
should take immediate steps to ensure that the whole market has access
to the same information
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
A company should correct a public forecast as soon as possible if the
outcome is significantly different
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Companies should not be drawn into correcting incorrect price-sensitive
information or assumptions
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Companies should be prepared to give a 'no comment' answer where
journalists are pressing for price-sensitive information. Where there is
a risk that sufficient price-sensitive information has been collected
for a story to be broadly accurate, a company should ensure the proper
information is widely available

FT  25 FEB 94 / From knee-cappings to normality: Michael Cassell goes on
patrol with the RUC Shankill unit in Belfast, where officers face chilling
experiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sgt Ian McKeown points through the bullet-proof windscreen of his patrol car
to a graffiti-smeared sculpture at the heart of west Belfast's Hammer
estate. 'Looks fair enough by day. But at night, this is where the boys get
a bullet through the knee or the calf,' he says.
A Royal Ulster Constabulary colleague, crammed in the back of the sergeant's
battered blue Escort, explains that the victims turn up by appointment for
punishment after offending their paramilitary minders. Not to appear would
result in an even messier fate.
'There's one who is supposed to have telephoned the ambulance before he set
out, telling them what time to get there,' he says.
Humour, at first, might not seem entirely appropriate in such sickening
circumstances but its importance quickly becomes apparent as Sgt McKeown -
which is not his real name - proceeds with his extraordinary job.
As leader of the nine-strong Shankill patrol unit he has an important role
in the 350-strong team based behind fortress walls at Tennent Street police
station. It is responsible for a territory which offers a cocktail of
everyday urban normality and calculating, murderous extremism. One minute a
driving offence or a 'domestic', the next a car hijacking or a punishment
beating.
Tennent Street's patch includes about three square miles of west and north
Belfast, predominantly Protestant territory squeezed into a wedge bordered
on both sides by republican ghettoes. The IRA launches sorties from the
Ardoyne and the Falls while volunteers from the loyalist Ulster Freedom
Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force take their orders from command centres
on the Highfield estate and the lower Shankill.
Protestant and Roman Catholic paramilitaries pass in the night, launching
raids into each other's areas. The RUC is caught in the middle, hated not
only by the provos but by the loyalists too if they think it is doing its
job too well.
The Tennent Street subdivision has seen 280 murders since the troubles began
more than 20 years ago, 11 of them last year. Nine of those deaths were in
the Shankill Road fish and chip shop bombing last October. Sgt McKeown was
among the first on the scene.
'Someone said there was a secondary device but no one cared. We had to get
them out. It was total chaos,' he recalls quietly. The signatures of 3,200
local people later thanked the police for what they did on that grisly
Saturday afternoon.
None of Tennent Street's officers have been killed since 1987, though a
colleague from a neighbouring area died last week - the first RUC victim of
this year - after a rocket attack in Friendly Street.
Everyone is horrified, though 293 RUC officers have died on the streets of
Northern Ireland since 1969 and people are no longer so easily shocked. Supt
Charlie Robinson, Sgt McKeown's boss, has carried two RUC colleagues to
their graves.
Armed with his Ruger revolver and weighed down by body armour, the sergeant
remains philosophical about the risks. He stresses that his job is as much
about the everyday task of community policing as it is about nailing
paramilitaries. He drives slowly past the derelict Lawnbrook social club,
one-time base for the murderous 'Shankill butchers' of the 1970s. The
surviving gang members got jail sentences totalling 2,000 years.
Sgt McKeown knows by sight a lot of the hard men. As Supt Robinson puts it:
'We stop them all the time. They know you and they know you know them. We
have to treat them absolutely correctly, until we catch them at it.'
The sergeant also knows all the alleyways and short-cuts and can match
endless locations to countless atrocities: 'That's where a young mother was
gunned down in the chemist's shop' - 'A Royal Irish Regiment man was killed
there with an assault rifle on his way to visit his mother.'
On the Crumlin Road he points out the grounds of a chapel, used by the IRA
to launch a recent rocket attack on a police vehicle. 'They stick packets of
digestive biscuits in the back end (of the rocket launcher) to absorb the
shock waves. Can't buy the damn things anywhere in the Ardoyne'.
He checks out an old cottage on the upper Crumlin where a woman was kept
hostage overnight to ensure her businessman husband handed over cash to
terrorists. 'Have to be careful here. It could be wired up. Wouldn't want to
buy it.'
Sgt McKeown stops in Ligoneil, a republican enclave on his beat, to watch an
army 'rummage search' on wasteland for a weapons cache or culvert bombs.
'Almost certainly find something around here, it's a favourite spot.'
So why does he do it? His pay packet bulges from endless overtime and is
further fattened by the Northern Ireland allowance - 'danger money in any
other language'. He has a pride in his work, a great 'crack' with his
colleagues, but above all he wants law and order and decency to prevail on
the streets where he was born.
Things, believe it or not, are getting better. Crime detection is up and
among the nation's highest. Terrorist prevention measures are working and
the neighbourhood policing strategy is paying dividends.
There are no end of applicants ready to join up. Catholics form only about 8
per cent of the total RUC force. In Tennent Street no one knows how many
there are because no one asks.
'It's a very happy place in many ways,' says Supt Robinson. 'We try to keep
the place as normal as possible.' In April Tennent Street's 20 women
officers will, for the first time, go on patrol armed with guns. In Belfast,
normality is a difficult concept to grasp.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Major to make offer to Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will today make a fresh appeal to republican leaders to
embrace the Northern Ireland peace process, offering Sinn Fein a full place
in political life in return for an end to IRA violence.
In a carefully worded message on the eve of Sinn Fein's annual conference in
Dublin, the prime minister will attempt to tip the debate within the
republican movement in favour of accepting the Downing Street declaration.
In today's Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, Mr Major is
expected to offer the most detailed exposition to date of the way ahead for
republicans once the joint declaration has been accepted.
He was backed yesterday by a call from Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, for republican acceptance of the declaration. Mr Reynolds urged
Sinn Fein to adopt a policy of non-coercion of Ulster's Protestants.
He said: 'What the peace declaration offers is a future free of coercion,
British or Irish, loyalist or republican. That is the huge psychological
step that we are asking not just republicans, but everyone, to take.'
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland
minister, is ready to begin more detailed discussions with the province's
constitutional parties.
Mr Ancram expects within days to start exploring the parties' reaction to
the checklist of ideas drawn up earlier this month by Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland secretary.
The talks are to run alongside discussions between officials in London and
Dublin on proposals for a new political settlement. Ministers hope for
progress on both elements of the talks process by the next Anglo-Irish
intergovernmental conference on March 10.
Against a background of mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of
the UK-Irish political initiative, the Ulster Unionists - the province's
largest party - will on Monday publish its proposals for a settlement. These
will focus mainly on a devolved government for Ulster.
Although a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration
is not expected to emerge from the conference, due to a stand-off between
Sinn Fein and the UK over the issue of 'clarification', Dublin has in effect
pointed to a way in which the deadlock might be broken.
Mr Reynolds referred positively to a recent article by Mr Mitchel
McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, stating that Protestants
in the province should not be coerced into a united Ireland. If the Sinn
Fein conference were to make 'a clear endorsement of a policy of
non-coercion' of the unionists, this would represent 'an immense step
forward', Mr Reynolds said.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Fixed-rate home loan costs rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, is today re-issuing a range of
fixed-rate mortgages at higher rates amid worldwide concern over the cost of
lending.
The move came amid reports that other leading building societies were taking
similar action and withdrawing existing fixed-rate offers.
The interest charged on the Halifax's three-year fixed-rate mortgage is
being raised from 6.7 per cent to 6.75 per cent.
The old five-year rate goes up from 7.2 per cent to 7.25 per cent, an extra
Pounds 9 a month on a Pounds 50,000 loan, while 10-year fixed mortgages
undergo the biggest hike from 7.99 per cent to 8.25 per cent.
Two-year mortgages remain unchanged at 6.2 per cent, and the Halifax has
introduced a new four-year term at 6.99 per cent.
Leeds Building Society was reported to have scrapped its five-year fixed
rate of 6.95 per cent and replaced it with a higher-rate mortgage deal.
At the same time Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Coventry and National Counties
building societies were also said to have withdrawn fixed-rate offers,
without yet announcing substitutes.
Halifax said the fixed-rate changes were caused by changing conditions in
the money market. Building societies were having to accept the cash they use
to prop up fixed-rate offers at less favourable rates.
Halifax added: 'The rate reflects what is happening in the money market at
the moment.
'Our general mortgage rate of 7.64 per cent is untouched, but fixed rates
are totally different. We have to go and raise money on the money market to
finance them.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Relatives of trawler crew sue its owner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Relatives of the crew of the lost fishing trawler Pescado have started civil
proceedings against the owner of the vessel, which sank with the loss of all
six aboard 13 miles off Falmouth, Cornwall, in February 1991.
A writ issued in the High Court alleges that the 22-metre, 60-tonne vessel
was operated by the owner at a standard below that expected of a competent
operator. Their solicitor said it also alleged negligence and breach of duty
of care of its employees.
The action has been taken by Mrs Rita Capon, whose daughter Jo-Anne was the
vessel's cook, and Mrs Mary Curry, whose son Neil was Jo-Anne's fiance.
The Plymouth-based Pescado was raised 240ft from the seabed last September
in a Pounds 220,000 operation financed by the Devon and Cornwall police
after Cornwall coroner Mr David Bruce called for an inquiry. This has been
completed and is being considered by Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable John
Evans.
Mr Alan Ayres, a shareholder in Guideday, the Plymouth company which owns
the vessel, said yesterday he would defend the civil allegations vigorously.
He has always claimed the Pescado was sunk by a submarine. This has been
denied by the Ministry of Defence.
A report from the marine accident investigation branch of the Department of
Transport believed the vessel went down after snagging her nets.

FT  25 FEB 94 / PM to counter attacks on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister and the chancellor are to launch an onslaught on what
they call the 'mythology' of Tory tax rises in the next few days, as Labour
continues to accuse the government of disguising the impact of tax increases
and cuts in public expenditure.
Mr John Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke are determined to counter the Labour
party's claim that the level of taxation under the Conservatives is greater
than it was under the last Labour government.
Mr Major will emphasise at the Conservatives' Local Government Conference on
Saturday that tax rises imposed in the last Budget were intended to reduce
the budget deficit, while taxation under Labour simply promoted bigger
spending plans.
He will say that the effect of the November Budget will be to take less cash
out of the economy than Labour claims.
The speeches will coincide with a fresh Labour attack on the Budget. Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday that government figures had shown a
fall in real disposable income of the poorest social groups in the past 15
years.
At prime minister's question time in the Commons Mr Smith claimed that
Social Trends, published by the Department of Social Security, showed that
since 1979 the real income of the bottom 10 per cent of the population -
about 6m people - had decreased both before and after housing costs were
taken into account.
The prime minister countered Mr Smith's claim, saying that real incomes had
'gone up sharply' for vulnerable groups since 1979 - 'over 40 per cent for
pensioners, up for the unemployed, up for those in work and up for those in
work but on relatively low pay as well.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Iraq arms disclosures 'hit public trust'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The disclosure in the Matrix Churchill case of information which the
government tried unsuccessfully to suppress has undermined public faith in
the standards of public service, former foreign office minister Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones told the Scott inquiry yesterday.
Mr Garel-Jones said that he himself had never had 'the slightest doubt'
about the propriety of signing a public immunity certificate seeking to
restrict information. But much of his evidence underlined the extent to
which ministers concerned have felt under increasing political pressure over
the arms-for-Iraq affair.
Mr Garel-Jones, a Tory MP who served as deputy chief whip under Mrs
Thatcher, said that because of 'misleading media coverage' of the
arms-for-Iraq affair, he had to explain to constituents that ministers were
not involved in 'skulduggery'. He said: 'Quite a substantial number of my
constituents have written to me saying how could you possibly involve
yourself in gagging . . . I believe that the suggestion (that the government
was secretly arming Iraq) to be wholly unfounded and to have been fed by the
release of these papers.'
During the Matrix Churchill trial the judge ruled that government documents
for which PII certificates had been signed by several ministers, including
Mr Garel-Jones, should be disclosed to the defence in the interests of
justice. Copies of the documents were subsequently passed to the media
without the judge's approval.
Mr Garel-Jones said no advice to ministers should be made public unless an
'independent judicial authority' ruled the interests of justice to be
overriding or if parliament itself decided so.
He also issued a personal defence of the role in the Iraq affair of Mr
William Waldegrave, his predecessor as foreign office minister. Mr
Waldegrave told the Scott inquiry in October that he approved the export of
Matrix Churchill machine tools in spite of intelligence reports linking the
company to a munitions contract. He was also one of the ministers who agreed
to a relaxation in guidelines on defence exports to Iraq without telling
parliament.
Mr Garel-Jones said he had asked himself, with the evidence of hindsight,
whether he would have done differently had he been in Mr Waldegrave's place.
'I think I would have been pleased to have done so well,' he told the
inquiry.
The inquiry was adjourned until Monday when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, will give evidence.

Directors of Newspaper Publishing, owners of the Independent and Independent
on Sunday, were last night locked in talks over the future ownership of the
newspaper.
The board committee of independent directors was considering whether to
recommend to shareholders a takeover bid from a consortium led by Mirror
Group Newspapers.
Meanwhile, members of the National Union of Journalists at the two
newspapers sent an open letter to Mr Ian Hay Davison, board chairman,
calling for the consortium bid to be rejected because it had 'failed to come
up with a bid proposal that guarantees the independence of the titles or
provides a stable framework of ownership and control'.

Improvements to Northern Ireland's top-security Maze jail complex were

prisons.
He made 76 recommendations in a report on the jail. Five proposals, relating
to security issues, were kept secret.
The report called for better conditions for inmates including access to
toilets at all times, more access to communal areas for education, craft and
hobbies, and arrangements to end the two periods a day when prisoners are
locked up in their cells.
Judge Tumim also said overtime worked by prison officers should be reduced
with a view to abolishing it.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Industry horrified by Malaysian threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Industrialists and bankers were horrified yesterday by the news that the
Malaysian government was planning to cease giving business to British
companies.
A banker involved in financing Malaysian trade said: 'We are doing
everything we can to get the Malaysians to change their minds, otherwise
years of marketing and billions of pounds of potential contracts will go
down the drain.'
The Malaysians will honour existing contracts but there will be no time
limit on the embargo on new business. The banker said the move could be
costly for British companies that were currently negotiating government
contracts worth Pounds 2bn.
A UK-Japanese consortium including Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Gammon
and G-Mats (part of GEC) has signed a memorandum for development and project
management of a new MDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) international airport for
Kuala Lumpur. The initial contract was worth a comparatively modest amount.
The expectation was that bigger contracts would have gone to British
companies. According to a businessman these companies were told yesterday
they would not get any of the more profitable contracts.
British companies including National Grid, PowerGen and Rolls-Royce are
negotiating contracts in Malaysia's fast-expanding power sector.
British construction and engineering companies, including John Laing, Bovis
and John Brown, have won substantial contracts in Malaysia and were hoping
for bigger things as Malaysia geared up to spend millions on infrastructure.
Laing has been negotiating a contract on the construction of a Pounds
200m-plus military base at Mersing.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has been particularly
incensed by press allegations that he was linked to Malaysian officials who
were allegedly in receipt of bribes.
A leading British businessman said: 'He is sick to death of the press
attacks.' The final straw is said to have been an allegation in the Sunday
Times that a British construction company was paying bribes to politicians
in Malaysia.
Today's statement from the Malaysian government is expected to express
'sympathy' for the UK government and British companies over the behaviour of
the British media.
Dr Mahathir has enormous power and influence in Malaysia. He has been in
power for 13 years. A government adviser said ministers viewed attacks on Dr
Mahathir as attacks on Malaysia.
Australia learned this late last year after an aside by prime minister Mr
Paul Keating which described Dr Mahathir as 'recalcitrant' for not attending
a gathering of Asia Pacific leaders. Malaysia reacted by threatening to
cancel Australian business contracts and to downgrade diplomatic relations.
The affair was resolved after public expressions of regret by Mr Keating.
This will be the second time that Dr Mahathir has launched an embargo on
British trade. In October 1981 he initiated a 'Buy British Last' policy that
was maintained for three years, after the withdrawal of UK government
subsidies for foreign students in Britain.
Dr Mahathir frequently attacks what he feels to be western arrogance -
whether it concerns world trade, the environment or human rights. He said
recently: 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous. In
order to be known you have to be nasty.'
Baroness Thatcher worked assiduously and successfully to rebuild the
relationship with Malaysia. She and Dr Mahatir have a high regard for each
other. Since 1988, when she signed a memorandum of understanding with him on
Pounds 1bn of UK defence sales to Malaysia, British companies have won a
series of profitable contracts.
A banker said: 'Apart from Hong Kong, it's the only country in the Asia
Pacific region where British companies have had significant successes.'
Britain has made an estimated Pounds 1.3bn of defence sales to Malaysia
since 1988 and British companies have won civil projects worth considerably
more than that. British exports to Malaysia have risen from Pounds 227m in
1986 to Pounds 862m last year.
But relations with the British government deteriorated last year because Dr
Mahathir was highly critical of what he viewed as Britain's inadequate
support for Bosnia's beleaguered Moslem community.
A businessman with close links to the Malaysian government said: 'He
lectured John Major about Bosnia for 55 minutes when he saw him last
September.'
Dr Mahathir and his cabinet then became annoyed by criticism in the British
press and parliament that the Pounds 1bn arms deal was won because the
government gave Pounds 234m of aid for the dam at Pergau.
A British businessman said: 'They can't see what all the fuss is about.
After all, they want the dam and it's being built by British companies.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / Hurd warns MEPs against Euro manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative members of the European parliament were yesterday given a stern
warning by the party hierarchy not to endorse a federalist manifesto to be
issued today by the party's allies in the European parliament.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, wrote to the party's 32 MEPs disowning
the manifesto and warning that the European elections in June would be
fought 'wholly and exclusively on a British Conservative manifesto'.
The EPP manifesto, released in Brussels today, will endorse economic and
monetary union and federal government.
Mr Hurd's letter coincided with a 90-minute cabinet debate on the impending
European and local government elections, at which Sir Norman Fowler, party
chairman, warned that the Conservatives faced an uphill battle.
In a televised party political broadcast last night Mr Hurd emphasised that
the Tory party would safeguard Britain's sovereignty in Europe.
He said: 'We want to preserve Britain's right to retain most of the
decisions about Britain's future here.'
The broadcast confirmed that the party would focus the European campaign on
Britain's standing in the world.
Sir Norman told the cabinet that private polls gave the party a double-digit
lead over Labour on the issue, compared with a 20-point deficit in most
published opinion polls.
Several senior ministers are expected to make high-profile speeches on
foreign affairs in the next few days as the party attempts to set the
election agenda.
However, the Tories' festering divisions on Europe re-emerged in a speech by
Lord Tebbit, the rightwing former party chairman, to the Radical Society.
Using language likely to irritate the prime minister, he said: 'Day by day
it becomes increasingly obvious that this government and this parliament
here in Westminster are becoming . . . agents for the enforcement of
decisions reached outside our borders by foreigners.
Mr Hurd's decision to send the letter underlines the party leadership's
sensitivity to repeated criticism of the EPP link from rightwing
Euro-sceptic MPs.

FT  25 FEB 94 / PM to challenge tax 'mythology'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister and the chancellor are to launch an onslaught on what
they call the 'mythology' of Tory tax rises in the next few days, as Labour
continues to accuse the government of disguising the impact of tax
increases.
Mr John Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke are determined to counter Labour's claim
that the level of taxation under the Conservatives is greater than it was
under Labour.
Mr Major will emphasise in a speech at the Conservatives' local government
conference on Saturday that tax rises imposed in the last Budget were
intended to reduce the government's budget deficit, while taxation under
Labour simply promoted bigger spending plans.
He will say that the effect of the November Budget will be to take less cash
out of the economy than Labour claims.
The speeches follow a fresh Labour attack on the Budget. Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, said yesterday that government figures had shown a fall in
real disposable income of the poorest social groups in the past 15 years.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Commons committee members ask for Pergau letters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Commons foreign affairs committee are asking the government
to release two confidential letters which outline why Mr John Major gave the
final approval for a Pounds 234m package of government aid for the Pergau
Dam, James Blitz writes.
The letters, written by Sir Charles Powell, a former adviser both to Mr
Major and Baroness Thatcher, could shed light on why the government
continued with the aid project in spite of vehement objections from Sir
Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration.
The letters came to light in a memorandum written to Sir Timothy in spring
1991 by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd said he had
'considered carefully' Sir Tim's arguments but had concluded that 'we should
support the project'.
Another document, a protocol signed in March 1988 by Lord Younger, then
defence secretary, expressly links the provision of aid to the Malaysian
government with a projected arms deal. Malaysia received more money under
the British government's Aid and Trade provision scheme last year than any
other country except China, the Foreign Office revealed yesterday. In a
parliamentary answer, the Foreign Office said Malaysia received Pounds
17.798m in 1992-93.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Tories press Clarke for rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, faces mounting pressure from Conservative
backbench MPs to order another cut in interest rates to speed economic
recovery.
Senior figures on the Tory right, led by Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home
secretary, are urging Mr Clarke to overrule the Bank of England and order a
cut of at least 1 percentage point in base rates from their present level of
5.25 per cent.
Many Tories on the centre and left of the party are also beginning to warn
that unless there is at least a small further cut, the government faces a
rout in the local elections in May and the European elections in June. That
view is being echoed privately by a number of government ministers who
believe that the chancellor was wrong to allow the Bank to limit the cut in
rates earlier this month to only 0.25 of a percentage point.
Mr Clarke himself is said to have been frustrated by the Bank's caution.
Some of his colleagues believe it will temper his enthusiasm for allowing it
a more significant role in monetary policy.
The chancellor is also boxed in by his public commitment to aim for a steady
sustainable recovery with inflation staying low rather than for a rapid
burst of economic growth, risking renewed acceleration in price rises.
That broad objective is widely shared across the party at Westminster. It is
also clear that Mr Baker's view - that interest rates could comfortably be
reduced to 4 per cent - is confined largely to the right of the party.
But with the underlying inflation rate still subdued there is a growing
consensus that Mr Clarke should move swiftly to reduce rates to 5 per cent
and pencil a further reduction to 4.5 per cent in April to coincide with
planned tax increases.
Some ministers share the view on the back benches that the Treasury has
underestimated the damaging impact on confidence of the tax increases, which
will add more than Pounds 12 a week to the income tax bill of the average
household.
In spite of the recent rise in the rate of annual retail prices to 2.5 per
cent, many Con-servative MPs appear convinced that the Bank is continuing to
exaggerate the inflationary pressures in the economy.
But in any event there is an emerging consensus that the risk of an upsurge
in inflation is far outweighed by the potential threat to the government -
and to Mr John Major's position as prime minister - of heavy defeats in the
local and European elections.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Strike by lecturers ruled unlawful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further-education employers yesterday won a 'landmark' High Court ruling
that a planned strike by lecturers was unlawful because they had not been
provided with the names of the potential strikers.
Natfhe, the lecturers' union involved, immediately appealed, and the case
will be heard by the Appeal Court this morning. The union plans to hold a
one-day strike on Tuesday next week in protest against new flexible
contracts.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the Colleges' Employers' Forum, described
the judgment as a 'landmark', and said only 28 per cent of lecturers had
voted for action.
Natfhe described the ruling as a 'disaster for the liberties of trade union
members'.
Unions and labour lawyers were surprised at the move. Mr John Bowers, a
leading labour lawyer, said: 'This is an unexpected interpretation of the
law, and it seems strange that an injunction should be given on those
grounds alone.'
Ms Sue Berryman, the union's chief negotiator, said: 'Parliament will be
seen to have been misled by ministers who resisted amendments to the new
laws on the grounds that trade unions would not be expected to reveal the
names of their members to employers.'
The change to the law on balloting - which was part of the 1993 Trade Union
Reform and Employment Rights Act - appears to have been designed to prevent
unions from surprising large employers over which groups of workers they
call out on strike.
Mr Brendan Barber, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress,
said this interpretation of the law was an invitation to employers to put
pressure on workers before voting. Providing lists of members who were
voting in strike ballots would be a bureaucratic burden for unions.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: A delicate mission to Beijing - Tony
Walker on Sino-EU talks complicated by China rejoining Gatt and by Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, faces a delicate task in
Beijing this weekend in discussions with Ms Wu Yi, the tough-minded Chinese
trade minister.
Sir Leon will be obliged to complain about Chinese threats against British
business over Hong Kong; although as a former British cabinet minister he
will not want to appear to be engaging in special pleading.
London expects, nevertheless, a robust performance since anxiety is growing
among British businessmen about the impact of the lingering row over Hong
Kong Governor Chris Patten's democracy proposals.
China's strong desire to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
is seen as a possible lever. 'It's certainly not in the spirit of Gatt to
discriminate against British commercial interests,' said an official in
Beijing.
Sir Leon is visiting Beijing for a meeting of the Sino-EU Joint Commission,
which convenes annually to review trade and related issues. This joint
session will have a sharper focus since the pace is quickening on
discussions about Beijing's application to rejoin Gatt.
The process has been in train since 1986, but the Tiananmen Square massacre
of 1989 slowed progress until late 1992 when the US resumed closer
consultation.
The Uruguay round, to which China was a party, and the birth next year of
the World Trade Organisation to replace Gatt have further stimulated
discussion. China wants to be a founder member of the WTO, just as it was of
Gatt in 1948, the year before the communist takeover.
Sir Leon will be left in no doubt by Ms Wu of Beijing's wish that
deliberations in Geneva in mid-March of the Gatt working party on China
should take on more urgency.
At a meeting this week in Beijing with Dorothy Dwoskin, the chief US Gatt
negotiator, China's trade minister spoke of a willingness on the part of the
Chinese to be flexible, but US and EU officials say that significant
obstacles stand in the way of China's Gatt entry.
The EU's main concern is to see a strong and enforceable safeguards clause
built into the protocol outlining terms for China's Gatt accession. The EU
fears surges of Chinese imports, and points to a host of what it sees as
dumping problems - discounted pricing of Chinese goods in the European
market - as an example of what might lie ahead.
China is resisting a safeguards clause, fearing that such a measure,
providing for the imposition of quota restrictions, would be used
arbitrarily to stifle Chinese exports.
EU officials argue that because of China's market reforms it should not be
treated differently from other 'free-market' Gatt signatories. Countries of
the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are
intent on ensuring that China's entry to Gatt is subject to the most
rigorous terms. China's boisterous trade performance in the past decade, and
expectations that this marks just the beginning, loom large in western
concerns.
Ten years ago China, with exports of little more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds
13.6bn), accounted for just 1 per cent of world trade. Exports last year
reached Dollars 92bn, or more than 2 per cent of the total.
But more immediately it is trade imbalances that are worrying China's main
trading partners. The US trade deficit with China for the first 11 months of
1993 was Dollars 21.4bn; the EU deficit for last year was expected to be
slightly down on the 1992 figure, which some estimates put as high as
Dollars 12.1bn. Japan's deficit exceeded Dollars 3bn.
US and EU officials, with the Japanese experience in mind, fear that such
imbalances will be perpetuated unless China is obliged further to open its
markets and reduce the monopolistic powers of its state trading
corporations.
'Lack of transparency in their import regulations and their licensing
requirements constitutes in our mind one gigantic tariff barrier,' said an
EU official. The US, for its part, is arguing that China should not be
allowed to impose import restrictions in any individual case unless rules
governing those restrictions are published.
China, whose tangled web of trading rules has been obscured for decades from
the outside world, has undertaken to publish an official journal of its
regulations, but foreign officials in Beijing are sceptical about this
undertaking.
They also have doubts about Beijing's ability to enforce standardised
trading rules across its vast terrain, especially in light of the growing
power of individual provinces and regions.
Among principle US concerns - and this may well be an issue raised by Sir
Leon - is that of access to the China market for service organisations such
as banks, retailers, accountancy and law firms, and advertising agencies.
'They are resistant - very resistant on services,' said a US official.
Rampant counterfeiting of such items as computer software and compact discs
is another issue likely to emerge, with both the US and Europeans determined
to tie respect for intellectual property rights to Gatt entry.
China, in spite of having reduced numbers of items subject to import
licensing, abolished some non-tariff barriers, and unified its currency as a
step towards convertibility, is finding Gatt entry a frustrating process.
While Sir Leon is not likely to adopt a confrontational stance, he will be
duty bound to remind China of the fairly stringent requirements for Gatt
entry. China cannot, for example, expect to get in to Gatt and then
negotiate terms for entry.
'We're trying to get it right before they get in,' said an EU official in
Beijing.

<TEXT>
Respect for basic human rights at work should be included in future
international trade agreements, Mr John Monks, the British Trades Union
Congress general secretary, told the AFL-CIO American union organisation in
Miami yesterday, Robert Taylor, Labour Correspondent, writes from London.
'We must press the case with governments for a clause linking the extension
of trade advantages to respect for employment rights,' he told the AFL-CIO's
executive council. 'In a time of heavy unemployment and insecurity such a
clause in the Gatt would be a powerful defence against protectionism.'
Mr Monks said he hoped the issue would be taken up at next month's jobs
summit conference in Detroit called by President Bill Clinton and at April's
Gatt meeting in Marrakesh.
He claimed there was a need to include a commitment to 'inalienable' rights
in trade agreements.
They would cover the right 'to form and join a union, to work free of
compulsion in conditions where life and limb are safeguarded against the
most dangerous hazards and to have redress when subjected to discrimination
on grounds of sex, race or political or religious belief'.
Earlier this month the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation raised
the possibility of introducing social clauses into trade agreements. Trade
union bodies such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
are also campaigning for them. Social clause supporters believe
international competition must not be allowed to result in declining labour
standards. But strong opposition is coming from Pacific rim countries in
South-East Asia.

FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US to reform export rules -
Non-proliferation of weapons to be main objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday proposed the most comprehensive
overhaul of the US export licensing regime in 15 years and announced an
immediate liberalisation of controls on computers and supercomputers.
The main aim of the proposals, which would constitute a long overdue
revision of the Export Administration Act, the legal underpinnings for
export controls, is to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Past efforts have centred on efforts to keep high technology
out of the hands of the communist countries.
However, the Computer and Communications Industry Association yesterday said
the proposals did not go far enough. 'There will always be unfriendly
countries and dangerous individuals in the world, but the threat to our
security and survival has radically declined,' it said.
The new regime will eliminate the distinction between national security and
foreign policy controls, which the US imposes unilaterally, and focuses on
multilateral non-proliferation control regimes. The Paris-based
Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) is due to
be replaced by an expansion of multilateral groups, such as the current
nuclear supplier group and the missile technology control regime.
The Clinton administration and its allies are now discussing the
establishing of a third multilateral group to control trade in dual-use
technology and conventional weapons.
The US business community, while rarely satisfied with the incremental
relaxation of licensing rules since the end of the cold war, will make clear
gains if Congress accepts the administration's plan. A group set up to
settle disputes over controversial licences will be chaired by the Commerce
Department, instead of the National Security Council as in past
administrations.
The balance between the needs of high technology exporters and the claims of
national security will shift decisively in favour of business.
Unilateral controls will be subjected to annual review and will be
discontinued if they are found to be ineffective or put US companies at
severe competitive disadvantage.
The number of products for which licences are needed will be vastly reduced,
and the licensing process, which often delays sales until they are lost,
will be simplified. The administration is prepared to guarantee that all
licensing decisions be made within 90 days, with most decided at lower
levels in less time.
Under the current regime, the Commerce Department yesterday eased controls
on numerous items, including relaxing the definition of supercomputers, now
defined as achieving 1,500m theoretical operations per second instead of
195m.
Countries on the nuclear non-proliferation special country list - Algeria,
India, Iran, Iraq, Israel and others - will be allowed to buy more
sophisticated digital computers.

Dutch electronics group Philips is joining forces with United International

dozen European countries.
The joint venture will focus at first on the physical infrastructure through
which cable television is transmitted, but may expand later into
programming.
Philips sees cable television as an important outlet for its ambitions in
multi-media electronics. It already owns stakes in cable television networks
in its home town of Eindhoven as well as in Vienna, Paris, Brussels and
other European cities. UIHI has interests in the cable infrastructure of
countries from Norway to Hungary.
The two companies' existing investments in cable television already cover a
potential 2.5m European households, of which 1.5m are subscribers. They plan
to expand the potential number to 7.5m.

<TEXT>
The US Export-Import Bank has come under attack from environmental groups
for supporting projects such as the Soviet-designed nuclear reactors at
Temelin near the Czech border with Austria.
Mr Peter Jankowitsch, former Austrian foreign minister, is in Washington at
the head of a government delegation to voice concerns about 'the
unprecedented merger of old eastern bloc technologies with western nuclear
equipment' that could, he said, pose a safety risk for the whole region.
Speaking at a House banking subcommittee hearing, Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank
chairman, said the bank plans to proceed with its Dollars 317m loan
guarantee backing the sale of a Westinghouse instrumentation and control
system and advanced-design nuclear fuel to Temelin, unless opponents
produced new, convincing information about the risks.
Improvement of procedures to assess environmental risk is already under way,
he said. However, the bank could not carry out its mission if it had to
conduct full-scale environmental impact statements for every transaction.

FT  25 FEB 94 / US says Japan 'drag on world economy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday accused Japan of acting as 'a drag on the world economy',
setting the stage for confrontation at Saturday's meeting in Frankfurt of
finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, called for more action to expand
economic recovery in the G7 countries, particularly in continental Europe
and Japan.
'I'm anxious to learn how Japan intends to create the growth led by domestic
demand needed to cut its external surplus. That surplus clearly is acting as
a drag on the world economy,' he said before leaving for Germany.
Although the G7 meeting had intended to focus principally on questions
surrounding international financial support for Russian economic reform, the
talks could be overshadowed by the US-Japanese argument, which has
intensified since the failure of the two sides to reach agreement on
improving access for US exporters to the Japanese market in their framework
trade talks earlier this month.
Mr Bentsen, who will meet Mr Hirohiso Fujii, Japan's finance minister, at
the weekend, said the US was considering 'a whole myriad of options' in
response to Japan's failure to agree to open its market under the terms of
the framework trade talks.
At Saturday's full G7 meeting, however, the US is likely to focus more on
the macro-economic conditions it believes are a principal determinant of
Japan's trade surplus.
Mr Bentsen is also likely to urge further interest rate cuts to spur
European growth.
Nancy Dunne adds: Market access goals, which Japan refused to accept in
talks with the US, will be set unilaterally by the Clinton administration
under legislation introduced in the House yesterday by the Congressman
Richard Gephardt, the majority leader.
He and other trade 'hawks' have brought forward bills following the failure
of negotiations at the recent meeting in Washington between Mr Clnton and Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister.
Under Mr Gephardt's bill, the Commerce Department will compile an annual
report on market access opportunities for US companies in Japan, based on
industries' competitive position in third countries.
It will define the 'objective criteria' necessary for each industry to gain
access to the Japanese market.
The department will also consult foreign governments, at their request, to
include information on market access opportunities for foreign suppliers in
Japan. The US will try to negotiate with Japan agreements based on the
goals, but if that fails, the unilateral targets can become the basis for
bringing US trade complaints and ultimately sanctions.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Trade row could harm important relationship: A senior
foreign ministry official in Tokyo talks to William Dawkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's senior foreign ministry official warned yesterday that the US-Japan
trade row, if mishandled, could harm one of the world's most important
bilateral relationships. 'If badly handled ..those trade issues have the
danger of affecting our overall relations,' said Mr Kunihiko Saito,
vice-minister for foreign affairs.
He was 'quite embarrassed and even worried' by Japanese press applause for
prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's ref usal to accept US demands for a fixed
target for a decline in Japan's record trade surplus.
Japan had turned down US demands before, on fishery and aviation rights, and
Mr Saito did not wish Tokyo to be thought to have recently become assertive
to the US.
'We failed to reach agreement on only three specific areas in all the many
aspects of our relationship. . . so we should not lose sight of the vast
perspective,' said Mr Saito, in an interview in which he showed a sharp
contrast to the bombastic recent line taken by US officials.
Mr Saito admitted the row had caused damage and that Washington appeared
'mainly interested in improving trade relations with Japan' when Tokyo was
trying to reduce the weight of economic interests on its overall foreign
policy.
'We are getting more and more aware that we cannot continue to pursue only
an economic role for ever and we have to try to meet expectations held by
the rest of the world,' he said.
Despite the row, Japan believed its US relationship was 'essentially sound'
and accorded more importance than ever to keeping close links with
Washington, not least because of its value as guarantor of security in Asia.
'Japan depends on the US for its defence. . . Although the Cold War is now
over, the pot-ential threat to our security continues to exist and we have
no wish whatsoever to develop our military capability. All Asian countries,
particularly members of Asean, think the US-Japan relationship is essential
for the safety, security and prosperity of the whole region. In that sense,
Japan and the US have a responsibility to try to remain friendly,' he said.
Whether the US continued to place such importance on Japan since the
collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the most uncomfortable questions
facing Tokyo's foreign policy planners.
'A few people' in the US government might not share Japan's view of the
paramount strategic value of the relationship, Mr Saito feared. 'We hope the
number of these people will not increase in the future. Perhaps we need more
efforts now than at the time of the Cold War to convince the Americans of
the importance of our bilateral relations.'
Mr Saito drew a distinction between Japan's unchanging desire for close
co-operation with the US and its preparedness to alter policies towards
other countries, in the light of post-Cold War changes.
Despite the risk of the dispute spilling over to other aspects of US-Japan
relations, the government planned to stand firm against numerical targets.
He understood why the US wanted to try new methods of reducing the Japanese
trade surplus in the light of the failure of many previous attempts.
Accepting a precise target 'may alleviate the present pressure but it will
only postpone the problem one year or two years', said Mr Saito.
Other governments, not just the US, would be tempted to blame Japan for
missing such a target and might then restrict Japanese imports on the
pretext of helping Tokyo to meet the goal, he argued.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India must press ahead with further economic liberalisation, trade reforms,
cuts in subsidies and reductions in public borrowing, according to the
government's annual economic survey published yesterday.
Without more economic reform, the country risks losing the hard-won gains of
the recent past, the report presented to parliament by Mr Manmohan Singh,
finance minister, warns.
The report sets the outlines of the government's economic plans for the
financial year starting in April. Its detailed plans will be made public
when Mr Singh presents his budget on Monday.
Investors welcomed the report, prompting a rally on the Bombay Stock
Exchange, where the 30-share index rose 103.55 points to 4132.33, close to
recent highs.
The report estimates the economy will grow only 3.8 per cent in the year to
the end of March, down from 4 per cent the previous year and well short of
the target of 5.6 per cent. Agricultural output is set to decline slightly,
following a record performance the previous year.
Industrial production, which fell sharply when India embarked on reform in
mid-1991, is recovering far more slowly than anticipated, growing just 1 per
cent in the first seven months of 1993-94. But the authors note signs of
recovery in recent months, notably in the consumer goods. industry.
The report blames industry's disappointing performance partly on the unrest
which followed the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque and partly on
continuing uncertainty about the impact of reform, which has curbed
investment and hit capital goods producers hard.
The survey highlights the country's export performance as 'the most striking
evidence of progress,' noting a 19.9 per cent rise in exports in dollar
terms in the nine months to December. With imports weak, because of poor
demand for capital goods and low oil prices, foreign exchange reserves have
soared to Dollars 10.9bn (Pounds 6bn) this month and should reach Dollars
12bn by the end of March. The current account deficit should fall to just
0.5 per cent of the economy, the lowest in 15 years.
The strong current account performance has encouraged more foreign
investment than expected. The combined flow of foreign direct investment,
investment in the stock market and in paper issued by Indian companies
overseas should reach Dollars 2.5bn in 1993-94, up from Dollars 390m last
year.
Weak imports have hit government revenues by depressing customs payments.
With spending also higher than expected (due to extra subsidy hand-outs),
the government's borrowings have climbed far above targets.
The fiscal deficit will be 'substantially higher' than the target of 4.7 per
cent, the report said, though it gives no figure. The deterioration in the
fiscal position remains 'the principal cause of macro-economic concern.'

<TEXT>
Japanese industrial output fell for the second year running in 1993, the
longest decline since the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis.
Production fell 4.5 per cent last year, an apparently encouraging slowdown
on the 6.1 per cent decrease in 1992, according to the ministry of
international trade and industry.
However, stocks of unsold inventories continued to climb by 2.2 per cent,
with a recovery of demand nowhere in sight, a Miti official said.
Output rose in the first quarter of last year, fuelling recovery hopes, but
then went into an accelerating decline, with the final three-month period
down 3.7 per cent compared with the same period the previous year.
Separately, sales at supermarket chains fell 1.1 per cent last month from
January 1993, marking the 17th month of decline since September 1992. While
the overall sales value fell, the volume of goods sold rose last month as
consumers hunted for the cheapest brands, according to the Japan Chain
Stores Association said.
A glimmer of encouragement for the Japanese economy emerged yesterday in the
form of a 23.8 per cent rise in steel exports last year.
The rise, to a four-year record of 23.5m tonnes, was mainly due to demand
early in the year from China, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said.
Property prices in the Tokyo area are showing signs of recovery, according
to a survey by a private research firm, Reuter adds from Tokyo.
Of 621 estate agents surveyed on February 14, 9.0 per cent said land prices
in the Tokyo area had risen from January, 55.5 per cent said they were
little changed and the remainder said prices were declining.
The number of respondents who said land prices were falling dropped for the
second consecutive month.

at a time when Tokyo was trying to reduce the weight of economic interests
on its overall foreign policy.
'We are getting more and more aware that we cannot continue to pursue only
an economic role for ever and we have to try to meet expectations held by
the rest of the world,' he said.
Despite the dispute, Japan believed its US relationship was 'essentially
sound' and accorded more importance than ever to keeping close links with
Washington, not least because of its value as the guarantor of security in
Asia, he said.
'Japan depends on the US for its defence . . . . Although the Cold war is
now over, the potential threat to our security continues to exist and we
have no wish whatsoever to develop our military capability. All Asian
countries, particularly members of Asean (the Association of South East
Asian Nations) think that that the US-Japan relationship is essential for
the safety, security and prosperity of the whole region. In that sense,
Japan and the US have a responsibility to try to remain friendly,' Mr Saito
said.
Whether the US continued to place such importance on Japan since the
collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the most uncomfortable questions
facing the Tokyo government's foreign policy planners.
There may be 'a few people' in the US government who did not share Japan's
view of the paramount strategic value of the relationship, Mr Saito feared.
'We hope that the number of these people will not increase in the future.
Perhaps we need more efforts now than at the time of the Cold war to
convince the Americans of the importance of our bilateral relations,' he
said.
Mr Saito drew a distinction between Japan's unchanging desire for close
co-operation with the US and its preparedness to alter policies towards
other countries, in the light of post-Cold war changes. 'Of course we have
introduced some adjustments in our relations to other countries, but with
the US we will be happiest if we can maintain our former relations,' he
said.
Despite the risk of the dispute spilling over to other aspects of US-Japan
relations, the government planned to stand firm against numerical targets.
He understood why the US wanted to try new methods of reducing the Japanese
trade surplus in the light of the failure of many previous attempts.
Accepting a precise target 'may alleviate the present pressure but it will
only postpone the problem one year or two years', said Mr Saito.
Other governments, not just the US administration, would be tempted to blame
Japan for missing such a target and might then restrict Japanese imports on
the pretext of helping Tokyo to meet the goal, he argued.
Japan would stick to this position, not because it was being assertive, said
Mr Saito, but because it believed this was the right thing to do.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Israeli minister expects further drop in jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in Israel fell to 9 per cent in the final quarter of 1993 -
giving a full year average of 10 per cent, compared with 11.2 per cent in
1992.
The improvement was hailed by Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister,
as vindication of the Labour government's economic policies.
He predicted a further fall in the jobless rate in 1994 to about 9 per cent.
The figures, released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, showed that
101,000 new jobs were created in 1993, an increase of more than 6 per cent
over the previous year.
Analysts attributed the falling jobless totals to three factors:
An increase in Israel's gross domestic product;
Israeli workers in the building trade have replaced many of the 50,000
Palestinians from the occupied territories no longer permitted entry into
Israel;
The slowdown in immigration from the former Soviet Union.
From a low of 6 per cent in 1987, unemployment had been growing steadily
until last year, fuelled by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Russian
Jews.
A new report issued by the Treasury, meanwhile, predicted 5.6 per cent
growth in Israel's GDP for 1994 - a revision of the 5.3 per cent prediction
in the budget last October.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Foreign Office officials yesterday regretted that the Chinese
leadership had not co-operated in moves to proceed with electoral reform in
Hong Kong. But they said that they could wait no longer before introducing a
new round of legislative reform in the colony.
A Foreign Office spokesman said that the UK had made 'strenuous efforts' to
proceed on the basis of an agreement with the Chinese government on
electoral arrangements. He said that the UK had offered revised proposals in
the course of the talks, conditional on reaching an overall acceptable
package. 'Our door has been open all along for discussion with the Chinese
leadership,' the spokesman said. 'It will remain so.' But he claimed that it
was necessary for the Legislative Council to begin work on the second Bill
as soon as possible, since all primary legislation needs to become law in
Hong Kong by the summer recess.
The British government also regretted the Chinese leadership's speedy
dismissal of the proposals. They stressed the proposals were compatible both
with the Joint Declaration made by the UK and China and with the Basic Law,
its post-1997 constitution for the territory.
Officials said that it was in China's interests to acquire a 'successful
Hong Kong' when they assume responsibility for it in 1997.
Yesterday's developments came amid signs that British MPs are increasingly
uneasy about Hong Kong's future.
A survey by an organisation called Access Opinions showed that not a single
MP was 'very confident' that the Chinese would respect the constitutional
arrangements currently being set up under Mr Patten's direction. It showed
that 54 per cent of MPs were 'not very confident' and 27 per cent 'not at
all confident' about the outlook for the colony under Chinese rule.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Beijing swift to show its displeasure
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's reaction to the passage of the partial electoral reform bill through
Hong Kong's Legislative Council was fast and furious.
Accusing Britain of slamming the door on further negotiations over Hong
Kong, Beijing said it would sack representative bodies elected in the last
days of British rule, giving the clearest indication of actions planned when
it resumes control of Hong Kong at midnight on 30 June, 1997.
Britain had 'completely' closed the door on further meetings; 'The British
side should be held fully responsible for ruining the talks,' the official
statement said.
Previously, China had said it was willing to resume discussions if Governor
Chris Patten withdrew his reform bill, but repeatedly warned passage of the
bill would lead to a complete breakdown of negotiations. 'As component parts
of the British political body administering Hong Kong', elected bodies
including the Legislative Council would 'definitely be terminated' in 1997.
It complained about Mr Patten's plans to introduce a more substantial bill
to LegCo today, including remaining elements of his reform package. Beijing
was further angered by Britain's decision to make public the contents of its
17 rounds of secret talks on the Hong Kong issue.
Mr Patten's second and more radical bill, due to be published today, aims
further to extend democracy in Hong Kong by broadening the franchise for
representative institutions such as Legco. Beijing claims these measures
contradict prior Sino-British agreements on Hong Kong's transition to
Chinese rule enshrined in the Joint Declaration of 1984 and the 1990 Basic
Law, or colony's post-1997 constitution.
China's critics say it fears the development of independent-spirited
democratic institutions in Hong Kong because they might serve as a model for
mainland democracy activists after 1997. China is now likely to step up its
own preparations for assuming control of Hong Kong, and in the process seek
to undermine Mr Patten's authority in the last years of British rule.
UK-China talks on practical issues such as the financing of a much-needed
new airport have bogged down because of deteriorating Sino-British political
relations. In its statement, China referred to a new 'political body of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region' that would replace LegCo. Exactly
when this would occur was not clear.
Beijing has been exerting pressure on Hong Kong Chinese involved in the
debate over the colony's future. It has repeatedly accused Mr Patten of
seeking to perpetuate UK colonial interests.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Two stones roll into China's path to HK: A double event has
made Beijing's regaining the colony harder though no less sure - LegCo may
have scored a victory in a war destined to be lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until this week it was possible to argue that developments in Hong Kong were
moving in China's direction. Opinion polls showed people getting bored and
frustrated with the bickering about politics. Governor Chris Patten's
popularity showed signs of slipping. There was even talk of defeat for Mr
Patten in an important vote in the local legislature.
But two things have changed this outlook and made China's recovery of Hong
Kong in 1997 no less certain, but seemingly more difficult. The first was
Wednesday's vote in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on the first stage of Mr
Patten's plans to broaden democracy in the colony; the second, the
publication of a disturbing report about attitudes to China held by the
colony's senior civil servants, virtually all of whom are ethnic Chinese.
Contrary to expectations, Wednesday's vote showed the margin of support in
LegCo for Mr Patten's democracy plans had increased. Excluding the three
officials who had to vote Mr Patten's way, the majority in favour of pushing
ahead rose to 10 from 8 members of the 60-strong assembly.
This increased margin may prove a useful cushion to Mr Patten when LegCo
comes to debate his second political reform bill to be published today. In
the face of Chinese opposition, this bill seeks to broaden the democratic
franchise for 40 of LegCo's seats at present subject to restricted votes.
The significance of Wednesday's vote was that China had drawn a line and
Hong Kong's local politicians collectively crossed it. China had said, and
it repeated it yesterday, that it would repudiate whatever LegCo decided
because no agreement between Beijing and London had been reached on the
conduct of Hong Kong's elections this year and next. LegCo ignored the
warning and defied Beijing.
This defiance may prove no more than an early victory in a war LegCo is
destined to lose. China is viscerally opposed to what Mr Patten is doing; it
views any attempt to lay down the roots of western democracy in Hong Kong as
Britain's way of perpetuating colonial rule. It also holds the cards.
Beijing is busily working on the 'second stove', its term for Hong Kong's
political structure after 1997. The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a
group of 57 mainland officials and Hong Kong plutocrats, has been charged
with designing this structure. The PWC is at present meeting in Beijing to
discuss the future structure of Hong Kong's executive branch of government;
by July it plans to have concluded its work on the political structure.
The hope expressed by British officials is that by the time China resumes
sovereignty over Hong Kong it will see that the result of LegCo's 1995 polls
pose it no threat. As Mr Jimmy McGregor, an independent democrat, put it on
Wednesday: 'What may be impossible or difficult for China to accept today
may be less so in three years' time.
Possibly. But Hong Kong's senior civil servants do not appear to think so.
An academic survey of attitudes to 1997 held by the 1,000 top managers of
the colony's 180,000-strong civil service lays bare a crisis for China in
the making. The civil service, one of Hong Kong's prized elite institutions,
is often credited with providing the foundation for the colony's remarkable
economic success. Members of the directorate, as the top echelon is known,
are recruited from the cream of the colony's educational institutions.
According to Dr Jane Lee, a co-author of the study and a member of the
department of public and social administration at the City Polytechnic of
Hong Kong: 'The civil service in Hong Kong is valued for its efficiency and
rationality; it is seen as incorruptible.
'Even though the government is not elected, it enjoys a high degree of
legitimacy because of the civil service'. Yet her survey found a third of
top civil servants said they plan to leave government administration before
1997; another 30 per cent were undecided. 'Strong resentment exists against
political interference from China. A sense of impotence is evident among
senior bureaucrats,' she and her co-author Prof Joseph Cheng said in the
report.
Senior civil servants have moved to protect themselves by taking out foreign
nationality; 77 per cent have a foreign passport. In doing so, they have
effectively disbarred themselves from senior positions after 1997. When
China resumes sovereignty, top officials will not permitted to have the
right of abode outside Hong Kong.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Inflation index to form new Brazilian currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is next week expected to announce the first steps towards a new
currency to replace the inflation-plagued cruzeiro real.
The move is part of an economic stabilisation plan launched by Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, aimed at tackling Brazil's annual
inflation of about 2,500 per cent.
Mr Cardoso is to launch the Unidade Real de Valor (URV), an inflation index
which will eventually form the basis of a new currency. Brazil uses several
indices to adjust prices and salaries regularly for inflation. But they
measure past inflation and often add to present expectations of price rises.
The government hopes its new index will eliminate such 'inertial' inflation
by stressing current rather than past price rises.
The value of the URV, linked to the US dollar, will be announced daily by
the central bank. The government hopes that businesses will quickly switch
from using cruzeiros to URVs and that the country will be able to move
entirely to the new unit later this year.
The government has yet to explain many of the details of the new unit or
whether its adoption will be compulsory. Workers groups are concerned that
salaries will be converted into URVs on unfavourable terms, leading to a
sudden fall in purchasing power.
Uncertainty about the government's intentions contributed to a sell-off on
the stock market, down more than 7 per cent at one stage yesterday. It was
blamed on rumours - which were denied - that the government was planning
temporarily to block foreign capital inflows. Foreign investors have helped
push the market to record levels this year.

<TEXT>
Progress is reported in talks between the Mexican government and rebels in
the state of Chiapas to end the two-month-old peasant uprising.
Subcommander Marcos, the Zapatista rebels' spokesman, said about a quarter
of their demands had been met after three days of talks. He said Mr Manuel
Camacho, President Carlos Salinas's peace envoy, had agreed to their calls
for better health facilities, education and housing in indigenous
communities in Chiapas, and respect for the rights of Indian peoples.
However, such issues were always the least controversial of the rebel
demands, and the government had predicted early agreement on them. The
Zapatistas' apparent demand for greater autonomy for Indian peoples, and
national economic and political changes will be more difficult to meet.
Subcommander Marcos said that national issues 'are too big for the
negotiating table' and would have to be made in agreement with opposition
parties. Representatives of Mexico's left-wing Party of Democratic
Revolution have met Subcommander Marcos and applauded his calls for greater
democracy.
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD's presidential candidate, said there were
encouraging signs that the government was willing to make the necessary
legal changes to comply with the spirit of a far-reaching accord agreed last
month between Mexico's political parties.
The changes include making electoral tribunals, which judge the legality of
elections, more independent of the government.
A senior government official said a special session of Congress to make the
necessary legal changes was now probable.
Mr Camacho confirmed that substantial progress had been made in the talks.
In an effort to dispel criticisms that he was breaking ranks with the
government which he represents, he he was in constant contact with President
Salinas and he would seek support within society for any peace agreements
reached.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New orders for US durable goods rose 3.7 per cent between December and
January - more than expected in financial markets - but the figures were
distorted by a surge in aircraft orders, which are volatile on a monthly
basis.
Excluding transport, orders rose 0.3 per cent, suggesting a weakening in the
rate of industrial growth since late last year. Excluding defence orders as
well as transport, orders declined 0.2 per cent.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the jump in aircraft orders - which
nearly tripled between December and January - was good news for the
still-depressed Californian economy. He said the figures did not include any
of the new orders expected from Saudi Arabia following the Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 4.1bn) deal struck this month between President Bill Clinton and
King Fahd.
Some analysts had feared that a big jump in durable goods orders would cause
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. Yesterday, however, the
relative weakness of non-transport orders was seen as further evidence that
the pace of growth had slowed to a more sustainable pace after a surge in
the final quarter of last year.
Reports yesterday of another increase in weekly claims for unemployment
insurance, to 378,000, was seen as confirming a deceleration in the pace of
job creation. However, the data on both jobless claims and civilian orders
may have been adversely affected by recent very cold weather.
The increase in durable orders in the year to January was 12.6 per cent,
reflecting strong gains in the second half of 1993.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Relationship still special but showing its age: Washington
views UK alliance from an altered perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The form of their meeting has been carefully contrived to present an image
of easy harmony. But the substance of the encounter will not be quite so
relaxed.
When Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, visits Washington early next
week he will receive the sort of reception from President Bill Clinton which
will be characterised by anxious UK officials as red carpet treatment.
After the recent storms in transatlantic relations Mr Major needs to prove
that he remains a welcome and important visitor in the US capital. Mr
Clinton is equally keen that the visit is seen as a success.
In a ballet of symbolism, the two will meet first in Pittsburgh, one-time
home of Mr Major's grandfather. Preparations are in hand to reciprocate
during Mr Clinton's trip to the UK in June, with a visit to his old college
porter at Oxford, a pint in a favourite pub, and a stay at Chequers.
But the elaborate emphasis on the etiquette disguises a more complicated
picture.
What Britain could once declare with conviction to be the special
relationship has not been as badly damaged as some recent newspaper
headlines have proclaimed.
Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's national security adviser, points out that the
telephone on his desk is programmed to reach Mr Roderick Lyne, his opposite
number at 10 Downing Street with the touch of a single button. Only two of
his other foreign counterparts have their own button.
'Let me very firmly dispute that this is a relationship in trouble,' Mr Lake
said in an interview with British journalists this week. But nor is it as
robust or as warm as Mr Major's government would like to pretend. The world
has changed and with it the relevance and strength of the Anglo-American
alliance.
On one level there have been the rows over Northern Ireland and Bosnia. On
another there was the personal suspicion caused by the support offered to Mr
George Bush by Mr Major's Conservative party in the 1992 presidential
election.
The two leaders should be able to dispose fairly quickly of one of these
pieces of grit in the relationship.
The message conveyed to London in recent days has been that President
Clinton wants to draw a line under his controversial decision earlier this
month to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US.
White House officials deny that they have concluded that the Adams visa was
a mistake, as their counterparts at the State Department or even the Federal
Bureau of Investigations have. 'We'll have to see what the results are. We
can't know yet,' said Mr Lake, insisting that Mr Clinton's disagreement with
Mr Major was purely tactical. British officials, however, take this as a
tacit acknowledgment of error.
The talk of personal animus has also been overstated. There are aides at the
White House - dubbed the 'Munchkins' by one US diplomat - who will lose no
opportunity to exact revenge for Mr Major's support for Mr Bush.
'I believe the president wishes he knew who they were so he could discuss
with them alternative plans for employment,' said Mr Lake, describing the
talk of animosity as 'utter nonsense'. Mr Clinton is astute enough to know
that relations with allies are more important than settling scores.
Bosnia - likely to top the agenda next week - is much more difficult. It
has, in the words of one British minister, been the 'real poison in the
relationship'. Britain was at the forefront last year of Europe's
destruction of Mr Clinton's planned approach to the war in the former
Yugoslav republic. More recently the prime minister acquiesced in the air
strike ultimatum against the Serbs besieging Sarajevo only after strong
pressure from the White House.
Mr Lake hotly denied Mr Clinton had told Mr Major that to do otherwise could
undermine the US commitment to Nato. But senior British ministers and US
diplomats said the president had done just that.
The differences have been smoothed over. But the potential for a further
sharp divergence remains. Mr Major's view is that the west has a chance of
imposing a settlement in Bosnia only if the US commits troops. Washington is
equally determined that no troops will be sent until a political agreement
is reached.
But British officials acknowledge that Mr Clinton could not obtain
congressional backing for the deployment of ground troops at this stage, and
that it will still be difficult if a peace agreement is reached. US
involvement in the peace talks is thus seen as crucial to ensuring its later
involvement in peacekeeping. 'If they are helping to broker the deal, they
can't cop out at the point of implementation,' a senior British official
said.
Mr Major's government insists with some justification that the relationship
can survive such storms. Trade, cultural and economic links remain strong.
In many regions of the world, notably Iraq, Britain remain's Washington's
most reliable ally.
'What is strongest in this relationship is a shared confidence, and through
that shared confidence an ability not only to agree on issues but to
disagree,' said Mr Lake.
But the ending of the cold war, the increasing integration of continental
Europe, unification of Germany and the economic power of the Pacific region
have changed Washington's priorities. Mr Major would do well next week to
acknowledge that reality.

FT  25 FEB 94 / France trims interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The newly-independent Bank of France cut its interest rates for the first
time yesterday, shaving 10 basis points from its intervention rate to 6.1
per cent. It said the cut was in line with a policy of maintaining the
stability of the franc over the medium term. The cautious cut reflected the
bank's efforts to entrench its credibility in fighting inflation. Shares
slid as dealers decided the interest rate cut was only a symbolic move after
last week's rate cut by the German Bundesbank. The CAC-40 index index of the
most widely traded shares lost nearly 2 per cent to 2,208, but ended above
the day's lows.
Italy's industrial producer prices rose 3.7 per cent in the year to
December, and wholesale prices were up an annualised 3.9 per cent. The trade
surplus rose to L2,420bn in December, and to L10,980bn for the whole year.
Switzerland's current account surplus last year rose to SFr27.6bn from
SFr21.15bn. It rose in the last quarter to SFr6.7bn from SFr5.25bn in the
third. Industrial output in the Czech Republic fell a preliminary 5.3 per
cent last year and construction output fell 7.5 per cent. Retail sales rose
1 per cent.
A surge in domestic demand boosted orders for manufacturing industry in
eastern Germany by 7.3 per cent in December compared with November. Orders
rose an annualised 6.7 per cent in December.

Ukraine's parliament sought to put Crimea in its place yesterday, affirming
that the region had no right to conduct independent foreign, defence or
monetary policies. It voted by 222 votes to four to give authorities in the
peninsula a month to bring Crimea's constitution and legislation into line
with Ukrainian law. The move was directed at efforts by Crimea's new

Ukraine's defence minister, Mr Vitaly Radetsky, denied reports that seven

France launched a FFr10m (Pounds 1.14m) campaign to persuade consumers to

fish after a night at sea. EU and other trading partners have accused France
of bending international trade rules by imposing lengthy border checks,
stringent veterinary controls and minimum prices on imported fish.

Faulty engine mountings probably caused the October 1992 Amsterdam air
disaster which killed 47 people. The Netherlands Aviation Safety Board board
said the design and certification of the Boeing 747 pylon was found to be
inadequate to provide the required level of safety.' Boeing has already
started equipping the 747 fleet with stronger engine mountings, one of the
report's recommendations. The El Al Boeing 747 cargo plane lost two of its
four engines and crashed into an apartment block.

Bundesbank board member Mr Edgar Meister said he saw room for further
declines in German money market rates following the central bank's discount
rate cut last week. 'We still do not have a normal interest rate structure,'
Mr Meister said. Inflation of around 2.5 per cent in the past six months,
and expectations that it would stay below 3 per cent provided room for the
rate cut.

Almost 300,000 engineering workers took part in token strikes and mass

negotiations over their pay claim, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The mass day
of action, the biggest so far in the wage round, was part of deliberate
pressure by the engineering trade union, IG Metall, before a strike ballot
is held in the state of Lower Saxony next week. The action coincided with
the third round of pay talks for 3m public sector workers, in which
employers are insisting on a pay freeze. The unions want a 4 per cent pay
rise to keep pace with inflation.

<TEXT>
Reform of the French pension system, due to be presented to parliament in
the spring, is likely to be pushed back to the autumn, the economy ministry
said yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris. It said the expected delay
reflected the time needed to study the various proposals for the
introduction of capitalised pensions to complement the existing 'pay as you
go' system. But it may also reflect concerns that the creation of private
pension funds could discourage consumption and hamper efforts to revive the
economy by stimulating private consumption. Economists believe the
introduction of private pension funds would increase savings and hence
reduce spending.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Firm Yeltsin line offers little joy for west: Russia needs a
stronger state, the president told deputies yesterday. John Lloyd assesses
the new mood in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin, saying he mounted the podium before the
parliamentary deputies 'with a special feeling', yesterday sought to define
a task which could engage all political forces in a common effort - the
strengthening of the Russian state. This was the theme of his 50-minute
speech which, constitutionally, defines the bounds within which government
should work. Long-awaited, once delayed, the speech was the first major
utterance from the president since the December 12 elections gave extreme
right and left parties a large share of the legislature. In choosing the
need to strengthen the state as his central message, he stole some clothes
from the new forces - at the cost of appearing harder on foreign policy and
of sounding largely incoherent on economic policy.
His proposition was that everyone would benefit from a stronger state: the
citizens worried by crime; the reforms which needed regulation; even the
former Soviet states which needed a strong Russia to 'guarantee their
stability'. The process would be achieved on the basis of the new
constitution - the one indisputable victor, he claimed, from the December
elections it was approved by a majority of those voting, but only 33 per
cent of the electorate).
The tone never resorted to the promises of speedy improvement which marked
his speeches over the past two years; instead, it was sombre, even
pessimistic. He emphasised the unrestrained growth of a corrupt and inert
bureaucracy; the lack of a market economy working within agreed rules; the
ignoring of laws and civil behaviour; a 'new estrangement of the government
from the people'.
On economics he sounded most like the Yeltsin of old. He said again reform
must continue, and deepen; that the struggle against inflation remained at
the heart of his policy (and that he would even invoke constitutional
presidential powers to bring it down - but did not define how). In a tone of
exasperation - one of the few times his even, strong delivery showed some
variation - he asked: 'What's stopping us making a brief outline of a range
of strategic industries, highly competitive on the world market and socially
significant for Russia - the more so since experts say this is not more than
10 per cent of Russian enterprises. It's just these plants to which we
should give normal state aid in the next few years.' Mr Yeltsin wants some
winners picked: that assumes he wants some losers lost.
However, he was immediately at pains to reassure the deputies and the
population that he is concerned about the consequences of reform. 'The
task,' he said, 'is to find a sensible relationship between the speed of
reform and of the social sacrifice for it.' He exhorted his ministers not to
forget the poor for a minute, and said that while a range of industries and
citizens must be supported, the tax burden must be cut back.
On foreign policy - the subject Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats has most made his own - he was tough. A
central passage called on the foreign ministry, already taking a much harder
line than before, to stop making concessions to neighbouring states and the
wider world. He said: 'We have a lot of evidence that our fellow countrymen
are being discriminated against. Russia's duty, in deeds, not in words, is
to put an end to these practices. If we are dealing with violations of
legitimate rights of Russians, this is not the exclusive internal affair of
some other country, but our own, exclusive, state affair.'
This could be threatening and was meant to sound so. To move to 'deeds'
could mean anything - from economic sanctions, to a refusal to move troops
from the Baltics, to military action. It is not comforting that Mr Yeltsin
describes as 'lacking resolve' a foreign minister who refers to 'ethnic
cleansing' of Russians in the Baltics, and who suggested Russian troops stay
there indefinitely.
Finally, he was curt on Nato expansion: 'This is the path towards a new
threat for Europe and the world. Russia is not a guest in Europe, but a full
participant in the European community with an interest in its well being.'
It is a speech which - in the aftermath of the Ames spy revelations in
Washington, the anger Russia expressed over Nato's ultimatum to the Bosnian
Serbs and its action in springing to their defence - will produce little joy
in the west. It is the programme of a man who is manoeuvring between
political shoals, and who can no longer afford to expose his patriotic
flank. The question is: how far does this go in practice?

FT  25 FEB 94 / Moscow set to resume gold swaps to finance deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is negotiating to resume gold swaps for the first time since the
Soviet Union's collapse in order to help finance its budget deficit, a
government official said yesterday.
'Such questions are now being examined because a swap is more favourable for
us than a straight sale of gold,' Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Russia's
Precious Metals and Stones Committee, said. 'We are looking at different
proposals to choose those most acceptable to Russia.'
But although he did not give details of the negotiations, he said the
authorities did not have that much gold to offer. The government's reserves,
which were held by his committee, totalled 177.8 tonnes while those of the
central bank amounted to 128 tonnes.
Out of those amounts, the government needed 50 tonnes for jewellery
production and industrial uses, and 'much less' than an initially planned
100 tonnes to redeem a finance ministry gold certificate which falls due in
September.
One western gold analyst said a gold swap would be worthwhile for Russia
only if it involved at least 100 tonnes, raising around Dollars 1bn. He said
he believed that Russia would get much harsher terms than a few years ago
because it was perceived as a much worse credit risk than before.
'It's like going to a pawn shop. If the guy in the pawn shop sees you coming
several times he will give bad treatment. Since it is possible they will be
offering less than 100 tonnes, they might as well sell it.'
Mr Bychkov expected Russia to mine 156.9 tonnes of gold this year, compared
to 149.5 tonnes last year and 149.1 tonnes in 1992. He said Russia would set
up a gold bourse this year as part of plans to liberalise the domestic gold
market. Procedures were now being developed for implementing a decree issued
by President Boris Yeltsin last December, allowing banks to apply for
licences to deal in precious metals. The decree also allowed foreign
investors in gold mining projects to recoup their investment in gold.

FT  25 FEB 94 / US to host talks on new Bosnia state: Ceasefire prompts west
to act quickly on Moslem-Croat confederation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem leaders will meet in Washington at the
weekend for US-sponsored talks aimed at forging a bi-national state in part
of war-torn Bosnia, a top State Department official said last night.
The Zagreb-based Croatian government will also join in the talks, which
spring from US determination to play a pivotal role in the search for peace
in Bosnia.
The move comes as a ceasefire signed by Bosnian Croats and Bosnia Moslem
army commanders is due to come into effect today. The truce mainly affects
central Bosnia but could be expanded to other areas.
Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic had talks with US secretary of state
Warren Christopher in Washington yesterday. Mr Silajdzic said the US was
being 'helpful'.
Under the plans being discussed, Bosnian Croats and the Moslem-led Bosnian
government would incorporate territory westwards and northwards of Sarajevo
into the new entity. The status of Serb-held territories in eastern Bosnia
is being left to separate negotiations.
One of the strengths of the plan is that it gives Croatia and the Moslems a
(face-saving) reason for ending their conflict in part of the republic.
At the same time, the US will be able to support the plan - and the Bosnian
government - providing a pretext for Washington not to commit ground troops
once a peace settlement is signed.
'If both sides agree to the confederation, the peace settlement could be
more benign and require fewer peacekeepers,' one western diplomat said. But
another diplomat disagreed: 'Any ceasefire and peace will require tens of
thousands of peacekeepers.'
The plan could entail transfers of population. 'Each side hates the other so
much. I cannot envisage Moslems and Croats living side by side, for
instance, in Mostar, in the near future,' a diplomat said.
The idea of a confederation has re-emerged for several reasons. First,
Croatia longs for peace, even though President Franjo Tudjman still harks
after his Greater Croatia. The threat of sanctions against Zagreb by the US
and some EU countries has played a role.
Second, the Bosnian prime minister believes the confederation could give the
Moslems access to the sea, and viability as a state.
Third, the plan could be sold to the US as, theoretically, it is seen as
preserving some of Bosnia's territorial integrity and has not been forced on
the Moslems.
The pitfalls are many. Above all, it depends on how the plan is perceived by
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who holds the key to peace.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman indicated in Zagreb yesterday that if a
Moslem-Croat federation was formed in Bosnia it could become part of a
confederation with Croatia.
In a speech to the central committee of his HDZ party, Mr Tudjman said: 'The
thing would be to have a sort of federation of Croats and Moslems (in
Bosnia) which would be in a confederation with Croatia.'
He went on: 'An alliance with the Moslems would protect the interests of the
West. Moslems would be directed towards Western civilisation, eliminating
the elements who would create a fundamentalist Islamic state in Bosnia.'

The prime ministers of Finland, Norway and Sweden meet today in Helsinki to
co-ordinate their positions before sending negotiators to Brussels for the
weekend's make-or-break talks on their terms for entry to the EU, writes
Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
Stockholm has hinted it would consider moving ahead to signing an accession
agreement even if one or all of its fellow applicants - including Austria -
were not ready to do so next week. But Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister,
said he was anxious the Nordic countries should reach agreement
simultaneously.

German industry was more optimistic about its outlook in January, reporting
better export prospects and improved tendencies in orders, the IFO economic
research institute said in its latest monthly survey, Reuter reports from
Munich. Positive reports on the business climate narrowly exceeded negative
ones for the first time for many months.
There were few reports of plans to curtail production.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Moslem-Croat ceasefire raises hope: West seeks to move

<TEXT>
US, United Nations and European Union officials want to forge ahead with the
peace process as Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem armies today begin
withdrawing artillery and other weaponry from central Bosnia.
If the ceasefire holds, officials will help both sides negotiate a
confederation aimed at ending the war in one part of Bosnia.
The proposed confederation envisages the Bosnian Croat and Bosnian
government incorporating territory westwards and northwards of Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital. The status of Serb-held territories in eastern Bosnia is
being left to separate negotiations. One of the strengths of the proposed
plan gives Croatia and the Bosnian government a (face-saving) reason for
ending their conflict in one part of the republic. At the same time, the US
will be able to support the plan - and the Bosnian government - providing a
pretext for Washington not to commit ground troops once a peace settlement
is signed.
'If both sides agree to the confederation, the peace settlement could be
more benign and require fewer peacekeepers,' one western diplomat said.
However, another diplomat disagreed: 'Any ceasefire and peace will require
tens of thousands of peacekeepers.'
However, the western diplomat agreed that the plan would entail transfers of
population. 'Each side hates the other so much. I cannot envisage Moslems
and Croats living side by side, for instance, in Mostar, in the near
future.' The idea of a confederation has re-emerged for several reasons.
First, Croatia longs for peace, even though President Franjo Tudjman still
harks after his Greater Croatia. The threat of sanctions against Zagreb by
the US and some EU countries has also played a role.
Second, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of Bosnia, believes the
confederation could give the Moslems access to the sea, and viability as a
state.
Third, the plan could be sold to the Clinton administration because,
theoretically, it is seen as preserving some of the territorial integrity of
Bosnia and has not been forced on the Moslems. The pitfalls are many. These
include the transfer of populations and the need for troops on the ground.
Above all, it depends on how the plan is perceived by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia, who after all, holds the key to peace in Bosnia.
French defence minister Francois Leotard yesterday expressed impatience that
UN forces had not moved quicker to reopen Tuzla airport for relief supplies
to northern Bosnia, writes David Buchan in Paris. The UN plan has been to
start sending air traffic specialists on March 7 to the Moslem-held airport,
which has been closed for nearly two years by surrounding Serb forces, so
that relief flights can begin by March 18. This timetable now appears to
have slipped.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Germany opens up public road projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday gave the green light for private contractors
to build and operate toll tunnels, bridges and mountain passes to extend the
country's highway system in an important new move to extend private-sector
involvement in the public infrastructure.
A draft law was approved by the cabinet in Bonn as part of the government's
drive to deregulate and privatise wider sectors of the economy. It is
intended to accelerate construction of road projects, such as the proposed
DM10bn (Pounds 3.8bn) tunnel under the Ruhr valley, which otherwise would be
delayed because of the acute squeeze on public finances.
At the same time the cabinet approved plans to step up its overall
privatisation programme, giving top priority to the sale of Deutsche
Lufthansa, the national airline, the Rhine-Main-Danube canal operator, the
Bundesanzeiger publishing house, and the state company controlling motorway
service stations.
The plan to step up private financing and operation of road projects, and to
allow the introduction of toll charges, comes on top of a decision last year
to seek private-sector financing for 12 large road projects, including the
fourth tunnel under the Elbe at Hamburg.
Those 12 projects, costing a total of almost DM3.9bn, would not be privately
operated, but would instead be bought back by the government over 15 years
after their completion, on the basis of a leasing model.
Mr Matthias Wissmann, the transport minister, said the new move would extend
the whole area of private involvement in the road network, although still
not yet allowing construction of toll roads: the projects would be limited
to bridges, tunnels and mountain passes linked to the main highway system.
The government's draft law will now be submitted to the parliamentary groups
of the ruling coalition to refine and send direct to parliament, in order to
speed up the normally cumbersome legal process, and ensure the bill becomes
law before the next elections in October.
Mr Wissmann said that the plan to allow private toll operators as part of
the public highway network would mean the private sector could remove
expensive bottlenecks in the system.
The plan was immediately denounced by the opposition. Ms Ingrid
Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the Social Democratic opposition in the
Bundestag, said it was another blatant example of the government shifting
its bills to the consumer - in this case, the ordinary motorist.
The rest of the government's privatisation programme may prove difficult to
push through before the October elections, officials admitted yesterday.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said that conditions on the stock
exchange, and the results of drastic cost-cutting, made the sale of
Lufthansa particularly attractive. However, it depends on highly sensitive
and complex negotiations on the future financing of the airline's pension
funds, which may well take months to conclude.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, would only say yesterday that the
big privatisation projects would be 'prepared' rather than 'completed' in
the coming months.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Italian Elections (March 27): The rise and rise of
Berlusconi - Robert Graham on growing support for Italian media magnate's
new political party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Watching our support grow has been like looking at a temperature gauge that
climbs up and up,' says an exultant Roberto Lasagna, campaign manager for
media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.
As the campaign for Italy's general elections on March 27 opens today, Mr
Lasagna claims his organisation's polls give Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia
at least 35 per cent of the vote nationwide.
If sustained over the next month such support would give the 57-year-old
owner of the Fininvest media group, who entered the ring only in January, a
good chance of heading the next government.
'There is no precedent in Europe of an entrepreneur entering politics like
this, so close to an election and with a completely new political movement,'
says Mr Lasagna. 'Within less than four months of being created, one in
three voters who have made their minds, is backing Forza Italia.'
The sudden impact of Mr Berlusconi owes something to his novelty value at a
time when Italy's traditional parties have collapsed and their leaders have
been discredited by corruption scandals. He is a genuinely new face even if
he is a household name because his Fininvest media group controls 85 per
cent of commercial television. The secret of his success is the way he has
exploited his wealth and his media outlets with sophisticated marketing to
launch himself and Forza Italia. It is no accident Mr Lasagna should be
campaign manager. He headed Saatchi and Saatchi's Italian operations and has
stepped down to act unpaid as co-ordinator and image maker - what he
cheerfully describes as 'panic manager'.
In the month since he decided to run for parliament, Mr Berlusconi's three
national channels and the host of local television stations he controls have
been reaching into the homes of more than 40 per cent of Italians. Screens
have been flooded with spots of a smiling Mr Berlusconi promising in his
soft Milanese voice a 'new Italian miracle'. Calling himself a liberal, he
says he has entered politics to prevent the left - dominated by the
former-communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) - from running the
country. He promises to create jobs, stimulate economic recovery and lower
taxes.
Although Mr Berlusconi's opponents criticise his platform as over-simplified
and dangerous demagogy, he has found an audience and he knows how to charm.
In his student days he worked as an entertainer on a cruise and has made a
lot of money out of popular entertainment. He and his advisers calculate
many people are unashamedly middle-brow, confused by the collapse of the old
political order and take comfort in the role model of a wealthy self-made
man.
He also is not the innocent he looks. To survive and succeed in business, he
had to fight through the political jungle and his ambitions have been
maturing for a good year. He began setting up a series of Forza Italia clubs
last September, each with a nucleus of 50 people and self-financing through
their own contributions and subsequently inter-linked by computer. These
were modelled on the experience of his AC Milan football supporters' clubs
(hence the name Forza Italia - the cry of Come On Italy).
Mr Berlusconi had intended the entire club network to be placed at the
disposal of the centrist movement of Mr Mario Segni, the former Christian
Democrat referendum leader. However, the two could not see eye to eye and
late in the day Mr Berlusconi decided to use the clubs directly himself.
Without Mr Segni, Mr Berlusconi turned for political support to the populist
Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi in the north and in the south to the
National Alliance, the renamed neo-facist MSI movement of Mr Gianfranco
Fini.
This coalition of forces is now crudely defined as a right-wing alliance,
facing the PDS-dominated Progressive alliance on the left and a rump in the
centre made up largely of the former Christian Democrats regrouped in the
Popular party (PPI) and Mr Segni's Pact for Italy.
Now that the campaign proper has begun, strict rules apply on electoral
propaganda. 'For us the campaign in a sense has ended,' says Mr Lasagna. Mr
Berlusconi has limited access to his trump card, his own media. He must now
shake hands and hold public meetings. With more than 60 per cent of voters
undecided, according to a poll yesterday, the real battle is only just
beginning.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Sweden's polar region thaws over EU deal: Opposition to
European Union membership is softening as the deadline for agreement
approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This,' said the aide to Sweden's conservative Prime Minister Carl Bildt as
he flew into the Arctic, 'is an away match.'
Heading for the small town of Gallivare, 60 miles inside the polar circle,
to campaign for Swedish membership of the European Union, Mr Bildt was
braced for a reception as icy as the sub-zero winter weather.
The area, like most of Sweden's far north, is both a bastion of support for
his chief political opponents, the Social Democrats, and of hostility to the
EU.
In the event, little stirred in the two meetings hosted by Mr Bildt - one of
about 400 school students, the other a town meeting of 150 people. Even the
prime minister's assertion that 'We are part of Europe  - we cannot clip
ourselves out of the map' drew sceptical questions rather than discernable
enthusiasm.
A series of opinion polls in Sweden and neighbouring Finland and Norway
suggest that opposition to joining the union is softening, just as
negotiations with Brussels on the terms for membership come to the crunch -
the deadline set for completion is March 1.
The latest polls in Finland reflect the fear of rising nationalism in
neighbouring Russia, with opposition faltering, to as low as 30 per cent,
and support above 40 per cent.
A series of negotiated decisions in December, on issues such as preserving
high local environmental standards, have seen support for membership in
Sweden strengthen to more than 30 per cent, with the 'no' side slipping to
40 per cent. And in Norway, opposition has fallen below 50 per cent for the
first time in months, with support rising to above 35 per cent.
All three countries - along with fellow applicant Austria - have promised a
referendum later this year to decide the issue.
On the flight back to Stockholm from Gallivare, Mr Bildt was reluctant to
interpret his placid reception as a sign of shifting opinion, but he did
believe feelings had become less entrenched.
'They are now listening very carefully to the arguments - people are more
accessible than before - but there is still a long way to go.' Mr Sten
Birger Grundstrom, headmaster of the Gallivare school visited by the prime
minister, said he felt opposition among his pupils - many of whom will be
old enough to vote in the referendum - was weakening. 'As they learn more
they become less hostile.'
Opposition to membership swirls around a number of issues in Gallivare.
Will the remote areas lose out on the generous regional and agricultural
subsidies they have enjoyed? Will national sovereignty be undermined? Will
foreigners flood an overcrowded job market and tourists trample the
countryside? Will the Nordic way of life - the welfare system - be
dismantled at Brussels' behest?
Mr Grundstrom says for young people, facing 30 per cent youth unemployment
in parts of Sweden and Finland, much depends on the health of the domestic
economy. 'This definitely influences them on the EU question. They link it
to the other things they are unhappy about, such as unemployment. If the
economy really improves, as it looks like it will this year, then so will
opposition to the EU fall.'
A lot will turn on whether the applicant countries win accession agreements
over the next week which they can present as favourable. Even then, there
are plenty who remain adamantly opposed to membership.
'The EU is about centralisation of power,' declared Ms Mona Larsson, a
former hotel administration manager in Gallivare who is now unemployed.
'Brussels will get stronger and stronger, it is inevitable. The EU is like a
ship being built in sections. Soon it will be put together and it will be
controlled by the bridge. It is better that Sweden stays independent.'

FT  25 FEB 94 / EU claims progress on Macedonia dispute
</HEADLINE>

   ATHENS

<TEXT>
Mr Hans van den Broek, EU foreign affairs commissioner, returned to Skopje
yesterday, claiming some progress on his shuttle mission aimed at persuading
Greece and Macedonia to resume talks in their dispute over the former
Yugoslav republic's name and flag.
The Dutch commissioner said after a meeting with Mr Carolos Papoulias, Greek
foreign minister, that there 'were a number of positive points' to be
relayed to Mr Kiro Gligorov, the Macedonian president.
The EU mediation effort has been welcomed by Greece, which maintains that
its European partners have not been supportive enough in the two-year
dispute with Macedonia.
Greece's decision last week to impose a trade embargo on Macedonia, which
appears to violate Treaty of Rome requirements on EU trade, is seen as a way
of involving the EU in the dispute while at the same time putting pressure
on the Skopje government.
Mr Gligorov, in a letter to the Greek prime minister, repeated his offer to
sign a treaty guaranteeing the border with Greece, proposing that it should
also be guaranteed by the EU. This would rebut the Greek demand that
Macedonia's constitution should be changed on the grounds that it includes a
territorial claim on the adjoining Greek province of Macedonia.
Mr Gligorov called for talks to resume immediately under UN auspices,
warning that the trade embargo would 'provoke undesirable consequences for
peace and stability in the Balkans'.
However, the letter made no mention of Greece's demand that Macedonia should
change its flag, in recent weeks the most prominent issue of the dispute.
Macedonian officials privately admit that the flag, carrying a starburst
symbol associated with the ancient Macedonian kingdom of Alexander the
Great, could be considered provocative.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Restructuring costs British Gas Pounds 1.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday counted the cost of losing its residential monopoly
when it announced a Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge to pay for a corporate
restructuring that will prepare it for future competition.
The company said 5,000 more jobs would have to go on top of the 20,000 which
it announced last year. The total number is equivalent to about a third of
the workforce.
But Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, would not rule out additional job cuts
in future, even though the restructuring will reduce the company's cost base
by Pounds 600m.
He said some of the restructuring costs could be traced to government
decrees that British Gas separate its storage and transportation business
from its trading arm. But most of the restructuring was 'management driven
to get us into a form in which we can succeed in competitive markets'.
Mr Richard Giordano, the executive chairman appointed last year to help the
company adopt a more competitive strategy, acknowledged that 'a
restructuring of this magnitude will be painful for some'.
But he noted that independent gas traders had captured 73 per cent of the
firm contract market by the end of 1993, compared with 49 per cent a year
earlier.
Unions reacted to the job cuts by demanding that the government intervene to
ensure that workers were not consigned to long-term unemployment.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour party energy spokesman, called on British Gas not to
make any compulsory redundancies.
The heavy restructuring charges resulted in a net loss on an historical cost
basis for the fourth quarter of Pounds 694m against a Pounds 234m profit the
previous year.
It dragged the full year figure into a loss of Pounds 285m, compared with a
profit of Pounds 681m last time.
Full year operating profits of Pounds 1.68bn (Pounds 1.66bn) before
exceptional charges showed that the underlying business was stable.
The restructuring charge was generally welcomed by analysts, who said it
showed that British Gas was serious about cutting costs.
British Gas shares fell 11p to close at 328p.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, revised its
outlook on British Gas's long-term rating, citing continued uncertainty over
future regulation.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Futures selling hits European bond and share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN, TERRY BYLAND and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy selling in the futures markets pushed European government bond prices
sharply lower yesterday and sparked a fall in share prices.
UK government bonds, known as gilts, posted the biggest losses, with
longer-dated issues falling by more than 2 1/4 points.
Wednesday's slide in US Treasuries, combined with fears that UK interest
rates would not fall further and could even rise, triggered early selling in
London that was later exacerbated by weakness on the continent. The Liffe
March gilt futures contract dropped by 2 23/32 points to 111 13/16 .
After European markets closed, fresh declines in US Treasury prices prompted
heavy selling of equities in New York, where share prices were already weak
on news that the multi-billion dollar merger between Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications had been abandoned.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 51.78 down at 3,839.90. Investors
were unnerved by another big decline in Treasury prices, which pushed the
yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.738 per cent.
The fall in European bond markets prompted the largest one-day fall in UK
equities for the past 16 months, although trading volume in the stock market
was not unduly heavy. The FT-SE 100 Index fell 74.4 to 3,267.5, closing near
its low for the day. The FT-SE 100 is about 7.7 per cent below its trading
peak of 3,539.2 at the beginning of this month.
Other European government bond markets also fell heavily, with traders
reporting heavy selling by US hedge funds. 'The markets are dominated by
overwhelmingly negative sentiment - looking for rational explanations would
be misleading,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi
International.
Nervousness in the bond mar kets has been sparked by the recent rise in US
short-term interest rates and worries about a pick-up in US inflation.
German government bonds fell sharply on concern at potential turmoil in
Russia and the prospect of unfavourable economic data. The March Bund
futures contract on Liffe had dropped by 1.31 points to 96.65 late in the
afternoon in London.
French bonds also fell sharply after the Bank of France trimmed its
intervention rate by 10 basis points to 6.1 per cent, on disappointment over
the size of the cut. The March French bond futures contract on the Matif
exchange dropped by 1.04 points to 126.94.
In European equity markets, Germany's Dax index of the 30 most traded stocks
lost nearly 2 per cent to 2,090. In France, the CAC-40 index slid about 2
per cent to 2,208.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Malaysia set to halt UK deals: Mahathir angry at press
reports about tactics used to win contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government is planning to deny further contracts to British
companies because of its anger at British press reports alleging that bribes
have been offered to Malaysian politicians.
The contracts freeze, which could cost British companies hundreds of
millions of pounds in lost business, was confirmed early today by Mrs
Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister of trade and industry. It was due to be
announced by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance
minister, although a press conference set for this morning was postponed
until later today.
Last night, Mr John Major sent a message to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister, seeking urgent clarification of Malaysia's
position. The Foreign Office was also striving to head off the breakdown in
trade relations.
The sanctions are similar to those imposed under Malaysia's 'Buy British
Last' policy in the early 1980s after Britain withdrew subsidies for foreign
students. They were lifted in the late-1980s after Lady Thatcher, as
premier, worked to rebuild ties with Malaysia.
UK companies, led by GEC, plan to issue a statement - in the form of
national newspaper advertisements - stressing the importance of
Anglo-Malaysian trade. Yesterday they secretly approached Mr Major urging
him to telephone Dr Mahathir.
Dr Mahathir has been angered by UK press reports of the alleged tactics used
by the UK government and UK companies in winning Malaysian contracts. He was
incensed by a report in last weekend's Sunday Times alleging that a British
company had bribed Malaysian politicians, an adviser said.
A banker who knows Dr Mahathir said he had also been bemused by criticism in
the UK parliament and press that a contract to sell Pounds 1bn of arms to
Malaysia was won because the UK gave Pounds 234m in aid for building the
Pergau hydro-electric dam.
Mr Dato Kamarudin Abu, Malaysian High Commissioner in London, said his
government was 'very unhappy about the constant negative reporting'.
Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC, the cable and construction group
involved in the Pergau project, said the ban would be 'a very regrettable
and unfortunate decision for the UK. It has taken us years to build up our
position in Malaysia'.
Malaysia is the biggest market for UK companies in the Asia-Pacific region,
apart from Hong Kong. Exports to Malaysia, most based on contracts with the
Malaysian government, were Pounds 862m in the year to November.
Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, whose construction
subsidiaries have won tens of millions of pounds of Malaysian business,
said: 'This is not only bad for corporate UK but could affect jobs as well.'
Malaysia is expected to say that it will honour existing contracts with
British companies. But a banker who finances Malaysian trade said a stream
of contracts, worth an estimated Pounds 2bn, would now be lost.
Yesterday, the British high commissioner in Malaysia, Mr Duncan Slater, was
told UK companies would receive no further work on a new Pounds 3.4bn
international airport for Kuala Lumpur. An Anglo-Japanese consortium,
including Trafalgar House, BICC and GEC, had signed a memorandum for
development and project management of the airport.
Other leading British companies, such as power groups PowerGen and National
Grid, construction group John Laing and electronics conglomerate GEC, have
been in negotiations with the Malaysian government.

FT  25 FEB 94 / China vows to scrap HK reform: Furious Beijing accuses
Britain of closing door to future talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China accused Britain of slamming the door to future negotiations over Hong
Kong yesterday and vowed to scrap representative bodies elected in the last
days of British rule.
In a statement of barely disguised fury, the Chinese government said Britain
had 'completely' closed the door to further talks on the colony's political
development. But Beijing stopped short of issuing any threats to Hong Kong's
economy.
China was responding to the passage through Hong Kong's Legislative Council
(Legco) yesterday of a bill enshrining the first stage of Governor Chris
Patten's plans for more democracy.
Mr Patten said a second bill would be published today and submitted to LegCo
on March 9. It contains proposals to broaden the franchise, which China
claims break past Sino-British agreements and understanding.
In an attempt to contain the row, Mr Patten said: 'Let us try to draw a line
under this dispute, and co-operate together in other areas in the interests
of the people of Hong Kong.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said the UK looked forward
to co-operation with the Chinese, 'in particular . . . to early agreement on
financing arrangements for the new airport and on Hong Kong's ninth
container terminal'.
Instead, however, China is likely to step up its preparations for assuming
control of Hong Kong. Beijing's Preparatory Work Committee, an
authority-in-waiting comprising senior Chinese officials and leading figures
in Hong Kong, is due to meet today.
After Mr Patten spoke in Legco, the Hong Kong government took the unusual
step of releasing its version of why the talks have floundered without
agreement, charting the course of the negotiations and setting out the
compromises tendered by Britain in a bid to reach a deal. Some 200,000
copies of the 36-page white paper were printed, 60,000 in English and
140,000 in Chinese.
The white paper, entitled Representative Government in Hong Kong, underlines
the gulf between the two sides, although Mr Hurd notes in his introductory
comments: 'Our door has been open all along for discussion with the Chinese
government. It will remain so.'
Accepting the Chinese stance as it stood at the end of eight months and 17
rounds of negotiations would have been to embrace an electoral system that
restricted choice and left elections open to manipulation, increasing the
possibility of corruption and vote rigging, Mr Hurd said.
The three main sticking points to agreement between the two sides on the
first stage agreement are China's insistence on reinstating appointed
members to municipal councils and district boards after 1997; China's
refusal to include the voting method for Legco within the initial agreement;
and China's view that the Hong Kong government should not legislate
unilaterally on any matter which had not been resolved in the talks.
'This time the choice was between sticking to our position or total
surrender,' said one British official.
Key to this were Chinese proposals which, according to the British account,
had sought to slash the original intention to open up the franchise to 2.7m
down to around 840,000 voters.

Wednesday's slide in US Treasuries, combined with fears that UK interest

March gilt futures contract dropped by 2 23/32 points to 111 13/16.
The fall in bond markets across Europe prompted the largest one-day fall in
UK equities for the past 16 months, although trading volume in the stock
market was not unduly heavy. The FT-SE 100 Index fell 74.4 to 3,267.5,
closing near low for the day. The FT-SE 100 is now about 7.7 per cent below
the trading peak of 3,539.2 reached at the beginning of this month.
Other European government bond markets also fell heavily, with traders
reporting heavy selling by US hedge funds - pools of private investor funds
which can be highly geared - and by European institutional investors.
'The markets are dominated by overwhelmingly negative sentiment - looking
for rational explanations would be misleading,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief

Nervousness in the bond markets has been sparked by the recent rise in US

In UK equities, selling was focused on the stock index futures market where
the March contract on the Footsie closed at a substantial discount to the
stock market itself. Traders believed that at least one hedge fund had
suffered big losses, forcing it to sell shares and bonds.
European equity markets also weakened. In Germany the Dax index of the 30
most traded stocks lost nearly 2 per cent to 2,090, and extended its fall
further in post-bourse trading. In France the CAC-40 index slid about 2 per
cent to 2,208.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Yeltsin signals a return to strong state traditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signalled a shift back to the 'strong
state' traditions of Russia and the Soviet Union in a speech to
parliamentary deputies. The speech may have stolen some ideological clothes
from the nationalist opposition but also claimed fidelity to radical
economic reform.
He spoke amid uncertainty over whether the amnesty declared on Wednesday by
the Russian parliament would release those - including former vice president
Alexander Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, former Supreme Soviet chairman
 -held awaiting trial for their part in last October's parliamentary revolt
against the presidency.
Mr Yuri Baturin, Mr Yeltsin's legal aide, was quoted by the Itar-Tass news
agency as saying that the decision could be annulled on legal grounds,
because parliament had in effect pardoned the alleged plotters, a right
which belongs only to the president. However, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, a
constitutional expert who is Mr Yeltsin's emissary to parliament, said the
decision was legal and had to be carried out.
The issue overshadowed the long-awaited speech. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former
first deputy prime minister, speaking in Germany said the decision was 'a
potential cause of civil war'.
Mr Yeltsin's toughest remarks in the 50-minute state of the nation speech
were in passages on foreign policy. In his most unambiguous vein, he warned
that any further expansion of Nato would be a 'path towards new threats for
Europe and the world'. In a similarly stark passage on the 25m Russians
living beyond Russia's borders in the former Soviet states, he said that
Russia would use 'not words, but deeds' to stop discrimination against them,
and to guard their civil rights.
A strengthened state, which was said to be necessary to address everything
from instability in the neighbouring countries caused by rising crime to the
need for economic regulation of the market process, was a theme which ran
throughout the address. Mr Yeltsin spoke steadily but without obvious
emotion, and seemed to have recovered from a recent illness.
Passages on the economy included 'the crisis cannot be overcome as long as
inflation remains high' and 'enterprises must stop producing products which
no one needs'. The remarks signify a continued commitment to radical reforms
in spite of signs that the government is bowing to demands from the
industrial and agricultural lobbies for increased credits.
The president also told his cabinet that improving living standards was a
key task of the year.
In remarks which briefly echoed the programme of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party, Mr Yeltsin called for the
mobilisation of all resources in the fight against crime and for a greater
concentration on the sale of arms abroad to fund social and other programmes
at home.
The strengthening of the state would, he said, draw together the federation
and would unite the government and the parliament in a common political
effort.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Banesto rescue calls for equity
dilution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banesto, the ailing Spanish financial group, is to call an AGM on March 26
at which shareholders will be asked to accept a considerable dilution of
their equity as part of a rescue plan.
A company spokesman said that Mr Alfredo Saenz, the caretaker chairman who
negotiated the rescue with the Bank of Spain and the main domestic banks,
was 'reasonably confident' that he would obtain sufficient backing for the
plan among the bank's 272,000 shareholders next month.
However, Mr Saenz could encounter opposition from Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's
former chairman who was replaced with the rest of Banesto's directors when
the authorities intervened at the end of last year, and from a number of
ex-members of the bank's board.
Mr Conde and the former board could control up to 20 per cent of the bank's
share capital.
The most controversial suggestion in the plan is a 43 per cent write-down of
the nominal value of Banesto shares from Pta700 to Pta400, to help Banesto
absorb over-valued assets estimated at Pta605bn (Dollars 4.3bn).
The spokesman said there had been 'ample conversations' with the Corsair
Fund, which owns nearly 8 per cent of the bank's equity, but it was still
not certain whether Mr Saenz could count on Corsair's support.
If the AGM accepts the cut in Banesto's share value, the deposit guarantee
fund, which is financed by the domestic banks, will inject Pta180bn fresh
capital into Banesto in the form of a share placing, paying the new nominal
value of Pta400 a share.
The placing will make the guarantee fund the owner of nearly 75 per cent of
Banesto's reconstituted capital, and the fund will subsequently auction its
equity to a strategic domestic buyer - either an individual bank or a pool
of banks.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Spain to clear way for EU entrants

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government, which has taken a strong line on terms for admitting
Nordic countries and Austria to the European Union, said yesterday it was
confident negotiations would be successfully completed by the March 1
deadline.
The optimistic assessment by Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's state secretary
for the European Communities, coincided with a private meeting in Madrid
between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission.
Mr Westendorp said there were now 'very few problems left'. Argument over
aid for under-populated areas of Finland, Norway and Sweden had been
'satisfactorily resolved' by the EU's proposal on Tuesday to set up a
separate regional fund, which would leave intact the current criteria for
support given to the EU''s poorest regions.
Enlargement was the EU''s most important and urgent task, Mr Westendorp
said.
He denied that Spain was insisting on budget contributions from the four
countries being channelled into 'cohesion funds' for the poorer states. It
was prepared to see the estimated Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.2bn) a year in new
contributions either spent on the full range of EU policies, including
agriculture, or used to reduce the overall budget burden.
Spain was still trying to ensure that enlargement would not damage its
chances of meeting the 'convergence' criteria for economic and monetary
union. But Mr Westendorp said it would be satisfied with a 'political
declaration' to this effect.
Still to be resolved was the question of Spanish fishing rights in Norwegian
waters, closed off by Norway since 1981. Mr Westendorp indicated that
Madrid''s request for rights to 14,000 tonnes a year was open to
negotiation.
Also to be settled were arrangements for qualified majority voting in the
enlarged community. Spain wants to ensure that alliances of three or more
countries which can now block EU decisions can continue to do so.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Swiss put brave face on transit lorry ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss government is putting a brave face on the anger in neighbouring
countries caused by Sunday's referendum vote to ban transit lorry traffic
through the Alps from 2004.
Mr Bruno Spinner, head of Bern's optimistically titled European Integration
Office, said in an interview that the complaints from Italy and Germany
about Switzerland blocking trans-Alpine transit routes were not justified.
Switzerland was not trying to cut off the flow of transit traffic between
northern and southern Europe, he said. On the contrary, it was investing
several billion dollars to build new rail capacity to handle the ever
increasing volume of traffic. 'We are doing this for Europe, not for us, and
no European Union money will be involved,' Mr Spinner said.
While he regretted that last Sunday's vote would oblige the government to
use force to move transit traffic from the road to the railways, he was
confident that by the time the ban came into force virtually all lorry
traffic would already have moved voluntarily because of the railway's cost
and speed advantages.
He suggested that in the longer term the most important of Sunday's
referendum votes would be the one that approved the government's plan to
relate lorry road taxes to distance travelled. This would enable the
government to push up the costs of using the road to the advantage of the
railways.
'In substance, the Swiss have chosen a solution that is perfectly well
centred in modern European environmental and transport policy. We may be a
few steps ahead of some others, but that is understandable since we and
Austria have the Alps in the middle of our countries.'
Mr Spinner admitted that the vote would make relations with the EU more
difficult in the immediate future. Switzerland has a long list of trade and
other bilateral issues to be negotiated. It fears the Commission will now be
less willing to advance talks, knowing that, as on the transit issue, any
agreement can be overturned by referendum votes.
Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, all important matters must
be submitted to plebiscites and, in other cases, citizens can force the
holding of a plebiscite by petition. Mr Spinner said philosophically that
popular legitimation was a crucial element of policymaking in all democratic
countries, although different countries achieved it in different ways.
'No legislation can stand over the long term without popular support,
especially on emotional issues. Most EU governments understand that we
cannot go in a direction against the will of our people.'
Mr Spinner said the truck ban and the rejection by Swiss voters in December,
1992, of the treaty forming the European Economic Area underscored again the
need for the country to join the EU.
Relations between Switzerland and its neighbouring countries, like those
among all western European countries, were now so complex and intimate that
it was increasingly impractical to resolve everyday problems by negotiating
treaties. 'What we are doing is a substitute for common legislation,' he
said. 'Treaties require ratification procedures and can be undone while
internal rules cannot.'
The challenge, he acknowledged, remained to convince the Swiss people of the
need to join the EU.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Employers back talks on works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European employers confederation, UNICE, looks set to recommend to its
members that they negotiate EU-wide works council agreements with trade
unions to avoid the threat of a directive on workers' consultation being
imposed by Brussels.
The move, which has to be confirmed by a UNICE meeting on March 9, follows
talks in Brussels yesterday between the European employers and the European
Trade Union Confederation.
One ETUC official described the UNICE move as a U-turn, impelled by a change
of tactics by the European Commission earlier this month.
The original Commission proposal for mandatory works councils in
pan-European companies has been blocked by UK opposition for three years.
But after the entry into force in November of the Maastricht Treaty, from
which Britain has an opt-out on social policy, the way was open for the UK's
partners to go ahead on their own.
On February 8, Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commisioner, persuaded the
Commission to approve a revamped plan, intended to be more palatable to
employers. Instead of a blueprint for mandatory consultation with workers
representatives, the new draft directive seeks voluntary agreements, with
unions and employers deciding their own arrangements. There are already 30
such agreements in force across Europe.
But if the two sides failed to agree, a reduced set of minimum requirements
for consultation would be imposed if workers demanded them. This was
dismissed as unacceptable by UNICE. But they and ETUC were given until March
22 to decide whether they could agree on a framework for voluntary
agreements which would obviate the need for the new directive.
'That is obviously now a possibility,' a UNICE spokeswoman said. Although no
formal decision has been taken, the European employers are understood
already to have opted for this course.
According to ETUC, this would accelerate the setting up of works councils in
the 1,500 or so trans-European enterprises identified in the original
directive. There would be less pressure for their introduction in the UK
than if there were a directive. But the ETUC is confident that UK companies
on the continent will be part of the scheme, and still anticipates a
spillover which will gradually involve companies in the UK itself.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Restructuring costs force Mitsubishi to cut forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan's largest trading group, yesterday cut its
profits forecast for the current year because the restructuring it announced
last year would cost much more than expected.
Recession in Japan has also affected trading.
The group warned that it expected net income to fall to a mere Y3bn (Dollars
27.77m) in the year to March, from Y15.3bn.
It had previously forecast only a small reduction to Y15bn this year, its
third annual profit decline.
The main reason is Y80bn of provisions for selling or closing unprofitable
businesses identified in a review of its 600 subsidiaries and affiliates.
Mitsubishi said this compared with Y66bn of provisions in 1992-93 and would
enable the group to start the coming year with a clean balance sheet.
Some of the businesses Mitsubishi bought during its investment excesses in
the late 1980s have turned sour, a problem faced by several leading Japanese
companies during this recession.
Mitsubishi Corporation, which includes oil and fuels, heavy industrial
goods, metals and textiles, is one of several of Japan's keiretsus -
families of companies linked by equity cross-holdings - to reassess their
alliances in the light of recession.
Last year the group disbanded its capital markets division and reorganised
20 to 30 companies including clothing suppliers in Italy and chemicals
interests in Indonesia.
The economy is still difficult and management will continue to monitor asset
quality, said Mitsubishi.
Mitsubishi said capital gains on the sale of securities would cover some of
the restructuring charges.
It expected annual turnover to be unchanged Y14,000bn and planned to
maintain the annual dividend at Y8 per share.

FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures failed to sustain a rally brought about by demand from
UK institutions and once again closed below the recent support level of
3,350, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 3,341, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was actively
sold by leading US houses in the first part of the session, leaving it to
fall to a day's low of 3,329. It was UK buyers that helped to bring a rally
in March and continued demand saw the contract return to trade above its
recent support level by mid-afternoon, reaching a peak of 3,359.
A poor start on Wall Street led to renewed profit-taking until the end of
the session. March finished at 3,338, a small discount to cash and 8 points
below its estimated fair value premium to cash which stands at minus 7 on
this account. Volume at the official close was 15,714 contracts.
Heavy trading in Hanson contributed to an increase in turnover in the traded
options. Total volume was 54,400 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of
15,377 and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 1,336 contracts dealt. In the stock
options, Hanson led the way with 6,468 lots traded, the February 280 calls
being the busiest series. It was followed by Barclays at 2,856 and Tesco at
2,823.
Activity in the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract traded on the OMLX remained
low, with a mere 188 lots dealt.

FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie rallies but closes below the
day's best - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market tried hard to rally yesterday as it digested
Tuesday's comments on economic and interest rate prospects from both sides
of the Atlantic. But the FT-SE 100 Index failed to sustain a brief recovery
to the important 3,350 mark. Bond markets continued to set the pace, and UK
equities were unsettled at the close when US Federal bonds, and Wall Street,
displayed an easier trend. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,341.9
for a gain of 8.2.
Investors remained torn between the favourable views on the domestic economy
expressed by the UK government's independent advisory panel - the Wise Men -
and the discouragement of short-term interest rate optimism from both the
panel and from Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman.
In addition, the equity market had to face the implications of the auction
of Pounds 2.5bn of UK government securities, and trading results from a
number of leading companies, which produced several sharply diverging price
movements.
The Footsie, helped by Wall Street's firm response overnight to Mr
Greenspan's congressional testimony, and led by London's stock index futures
market, advanced 14.7 to 3,348.4 in early trading. Gilt-edged stocks moved
erratically as the auction unwound and the US bond market braced itself for
the outcome of the auction of two-year Federal notes in New York. A rally in
bonds later carried the Footsie briefly to 3,355, a net rise of 21 points
and a brief recapture of an important benchmark for the stock market.
The financial sectors suffered a further setback after National Westminster
Bank disclosed a profits and dividend gain which fell far short of market
expectations. Results from Commercial Union were overshadowed by the
uncertainty cast over the insurance sector in the previous session when
Guardian Royal Exchange warned of increasing competition. Shares in British
Aerospace improved, however, following the trading statement, which showed
heavy provisions in the turbo divisions.
Today brings a list of trading reports from leading UK companies, including
British Gas, Shell Transport and ICI. Some analysts believe that, following
comments from the Wise Men, the UK stock market may now turn away from the
interest rate factors which have been influencing shares, and look for signs
from corporate profits statements that economic recovery is showing through
in profit and loss accounts.
An indication of recovering confidence among investors was shown by the
increase in Seaq trading volume to 822.4m shares from the 625.1m of the
previous session. Second line issues played a significant role, making up
around 60 per cent of the total, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on 6 points
at 3,974.9.
Equity trading volume has been falling away since the Footsie began to give
ground, but there was a sharp recovery on Tuesday when retail, or genuine
customer, business in UK shares jumped to Pounds 1.6bn, a return to the best
levels of the past 12 months.
There were indications yesterday that analysts of the London market, while
remaining optimistic overall, were reconsidering their year-end targets in
the wake of the discouragement given to base rate optimism this week. Some
believe that European bond markets may be able to uncouple from trends in
the US fixed interest sector.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of restructuring charges hung over several food manufacturing
stocks following the Pounds 490m provision by Unilever on Tuesday. The
Anglo-Dutch company blamed tough competition in Europe and the US for the
move, raising fears that companies in similarly competitive markets will
also be forced to retrench.
United Biscuits, which reports finals on March 17, was one company
attracting speculation, the shares dipping 4 to 338p. The company reported
flat profits at the half-way stage in the face of fierce competition in the
biscuit market and at its US subsidiary Keebler. Also touted was Unigate,
which faces restructuring in the UK dairy market later this year, and
continuing changes in consumer tastes as more people use cartons instead of
bottles. The shares fell 6 to 373p. Unilever retreated a further 12 to 1150p
on negative comments on the provisions.
British Gas attracted exceptionally heavy two-way activity following the
regulator's annual review and ahead of preliminary figures today. Some 15m
Gas shares changed hands, with dealers saying that one big institution,
which had been responsible for much of the selling on Tuesday, was
continuing to unload stock. The stock was easily absorbed and Gas shares
held up well to close unaltered at 339p. Traders said today's results could
contain exceptional restructuring of up to Pounds 1bn.
BP continued to edge higher, closing 3 up at 369p on heavy turnover of 14m
although some traders expressed surprise at BP's resilience in the face of
some continued selling from the US. Shell, also made progress ahead of
today's full-year results and rose 4 to 722p.
Barclays Bank shares were unsettled by the slide in NatWest and dropped 10
to 564p, but closed well above the day's low point of 544p, after big
turnover of 9.7m. Lloyds, on the other hand, were boosted by switching out
of the likes of NatWest and Barclays and settled 13 higher at 597p. A seller
of a block of 2.5m shares depressed Abbey National, which closed at 507p.
Commercial Union's preliminary results and dividend were above most market
expectations and triggered an early rise in the shares, although this was
eroded later in the day as dealers continued to fret about pressures on
insurance rates in the UK. Marked up to 634p at the outset CU shares
subsequently fell back to close a net 8 off at 616p. Royals were upset by
worries about the market's response to the current crop of results and
settled 8 off at 290p.
Mining group RTZ closed 14 higher at 828p in the registered shares with
Kleinwort Benson repeating its buy stance and helping the stock recover from
recent falls. Analysts also expect good figures next week from CRA, the
Australian mining conglomerate in which RTZ has a 49 per cent stake.
Hanson rebounded 4 to 279p on consideration of Tuesday's Dollars 1bn
convertible bond issue. Turnover of 11m shares was boosted by the equivalent
of 6.5m shares traded in the form of options.
Bread and pet foods group Carrs Milling attracted bid talk following
disclosure late on Tuesday that Northern Foods had sold its 4.74 per cent
stake to an unidentified buyer. Dalgety was an early favourite, but sources
close to Carrs insisted that the stake went to institutions. Carrs surged 12
to 209p. Dalgety fell 10 to 467p.
Engineering group Siebe broke finished 17 ahead at 606p. The group is to
hold a presentation at SG Warburg next week. BBA Group, shed 5 to 214p, amid
fears that it will announce a charge to cover redundancies with next month's
full-year figures. There were also whispers that the dividend may be
reduced.
Chloride, the batteries manufacturer, held at 32 1/2 p, with the market
alerted to the placing of a near 20 per cent stake in the company by SSA &amp;
Partners, the Swedish company. Turnover in Chloride reached 95m shares.

FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe doubts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A strong initial rise in British Aerospace was checked by sharp profits
downgrades as the market looked towards the near-term prospects for the
group. The shares were up 35 at best but ended the day 9 ahead at 549p after
hefty trading of 7.6m.
BAe reported losses sharply reduced at Pounds 237m, a near 20 per cent jump
in the dividend, favourable cash flow and a lack of surprise write-offs.
However, the analysts' meeting with the company dispersed the euphoria as it
became clear that big losses at the group's commercial aircraft division
were set to continue. BAe also indicated that defence profits were likely to
soften over the next two years.
Long-term bull Strauss Turnbull reduced it current-year forecast by Pounds
35m to Pounds 215m and Paribas cut by Pounds 60m to Pounds 190m. Mr Paul
Compton of Credit Lyonnais Laing came in at the bottom of the range with a
Pounds 165m estimate but remained guardedly optimistic. 'The financial
implications of the recent Rover deal are so significant as to outweigh
trading disappointment,' he argued.

FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest fails to please

Financial stocks were shaken as National Westminster Bank reported
preliminary profits at the lower end of market estimates and disappointed
the market's optimists in revealing a 6 per cent increase in the dividend
total.
NatWest shares plunged soon after the figures were released and ended a
turbulent session 28 1/2 lower at 503 1/2 p. The pressure of selling was
sufficient to produce the heaviest day's business in NatWest shares - 20m -
since September 17, 1992, the day after the UK withdrew from the ERM.
One bank specialist said the market was not especially perturbed by the
profits and dividend figures but there was a worry that the underlying
profits could be coming under pressure. There was also concern that the
exceptionally good results from NatWest Markets may not be sustainable.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fresh worries on rates leave
Dow lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday as worries about a further possible increase
in short-term interest rates drove bond prices down, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 19.98 off at 3,891.68 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.77 to 470.69. The Nasdaq composite shed 2.04
to 789.11. NYSE volume came to 309.9m shares.
The session began quietly, with no fresh economic news due until today's
report on January durable goods orders.
The clean slate brought relative tranquility to the US Treasury market, and
bonds and stocks drifted lower in uninspired trading. The tone in part
reflected the reassuring effect of Tuesday's testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman. He said the Fed was likely to lift interest
rates again, but he left vague the timing of such a move, which appeared to
comfort investors. Just after midday, however, the Treasury market began to
focus on Mr Greenspan's remark that durable goods orders were a factor that
could spur inflation. Traders soon were speculating that today's data could
trigger the next strike by the Fed.
That fear sent bond prices sharply lower during the afternoon, and stocks
followed their lead. By the end of the session, the Dow industrials were
near their lowest levels of the session, with Alcoa, United Technologies and
Goodyear Tire among the biggest losers.
Retailing issues were among the most widely traded. Wal-Mart added Dollars
3/4 at Dollars 29 amid expectations of more restrained growth for the
discount store chain.
Home Depot was also in play yesterday, after releasing strong quarterly
results during the previous session. The do-it-yourself warehouse chain
gained Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 42 3/8 .
In banking, First Interstate Bancorp shot up Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 69 3/4
amid speculation that it was holding merger talks with another company.
Wells Fargo, often suggested as a potential partner with First Interstate,
slid Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 136 7/8 .
Fibreboard rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 on the Amex on a report that
a Minnesota investment group was considering a bid for the building
materials supplier.
Brazil
The Sao Paulo market closed just 0.9 per cent higher in nervous trade after
a strong wave of profit-taking late in the session had erased most of an
early fresh advance.
The Bovespa index, 5.3 per cent stronger at mid-morning, showed a gain on
the day of 93 points at 10,630. Prices fluctuated sharply due to renewed
nervousness over the final congressional vote due to be taken later that day
on economy minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's social welfare fund bill.
Canada
Toronto showed no clear trend yesterday in the wake of the federal budget
which was announced after the stock market close on Tuesday. The TSE 300
index lost 2.8 at 4,368.3 but rises led falls by 428 to 338. Volume was
82.5m shares.
Analysts said the government's projection of a CDollars 39.7bn budget
deficit for the 1995 fiscal year starting April 1 was in line with market
expectations. Business groups gave the budget mixed reviews, mostly for
failing to take bolder action on deficit reduction.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses ignore Wall Street,
stay in high ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses seemed to feel that they were due for a recovery after three
Eurotrack 100 falls in succession, writes Our Markets Staff. Late yesterday,
they were mostly uninclined to change direction when Wall Street wobbled
intermittently lower, on renewed interest rate and inflation fears.
FRANKFURT followed bund and Dax futures higher, although the market also
said that it was waiting for inflation news tomorrow, a January M3 growth
figure that could come in anywhere between 6 and 12 per cent, and more news
on strikes from the IG Metall engineering workers' union.
In the meantime, futures markets chose the more comforting interpretation of
Tuesday's remarks on US interest rates by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman. The March bund future, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B
Metzler in Frankfurt, recovered to around 98 from 97.24 on Monday, and the
Dax future was 32.5 higher at 2,148.5.
This took the Dax index up 20.05 to 2,127.67 on the session, and by another
12.58 to 2,140.25 in Ibis afternoon trading. Turnover eased from DM7.6bn to
DM7.5bn.
Financials, which had suffered from the bond market's weakness, recovered
strongly: Allianz rose DM28 to DM2,628 on the session and DM27 more to
DM2,655 after hours, and Deutsche Bank and Dresdner followed suit. Chemicals
were strong, too, BASF finishing at DM297.50 after a session gain of DM4.80
to DM295.50; the sector, said Ms Altmann, was seen as an early beneficiary
in the economic recovery cycle.
AMSTERDAM resumed an upward course, although Unilever shed a further Fl 2.00
to Fl 219.50, bringing its losses on the week so far to 2.6 per cent, as
investors continued to react to Tuesday's disappointing results and news
that it was to restructure worldwide operations.
The AEX index gained 3.58 to 425.81.
Royal Dutch gained 60 cents to Fl 208.40 ahead of results which are due out
today. Kleinwort Benson, in a note issued earlier this week, commented that
while expecting results at the top end of market expectations, both Shell
and Royal Dutch looked expensive 'as we believe that low dividend cover will
mean pedestrian dividend growth for 1994 onwards'.
Fokker firmed 40 cents to Fl 22.00 on reports that it had won a Fl 10m order
to supply satellite components to British Aerospace.
PARIS was supported by a stronger bond market, although turnover in quities
drifted down to about FFr3.5bn as the CAC-40 index gained 25.27 or 1.1 per
cent to 2,252.00.
While there remains a glimmer of hope that the Bank of France may lower
domestic interest rates today, most traders feel that room for manoeuvre has
become even more restricted following comments by Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, earlier this week.
Activity was generally muted yesterday, with Saint-Gobain rising FFr20 to
FFr682 following news of its rights issue on Tuesday and BSN, the food
group, adding FFr19 to FFr933 as it reported that a promotion campaign at
the end of last year had been successful.
MILAN failed to maintain its early upward momentum and the Comit index shed
2.44 to 669.72 as the market's correction reasserted itself.
Olivetti put on L55 or 2.4 per cent to L2,359 after the news that its
Omnitel consortium had joined forces with a former rival, Pronto Italia, to
make a joint bid for Italy's second cellular phone licence.
Ferruzzi shed L146 or 7.6 per cent to L1,785 after the Consob regulatory
body said that creditor banks which took major stakes during the rights
issue need not make a public buy offer for the group.
BCI shed another L191 or 3.2 per cent to L5,738 after Tuesday's 4.7 per cent
fall ahead of next week's privatisation: the sell-off price is expected to
be well below current levels. Generali, which said that it had taken a 2 per
cent stake in BCI, turned back after an early advance to L40,960 to finish
L403 lower at L40,200.
ZURICH bounced back after the hesitant mood earlier in the week and the SMI
index added 44.7 or 1.5 per cent to 3,027.5, reassured by comments by Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, which came after the market closed on
Tuesday.
UBS picked up SFr25 to SFr1,472 ahead of results tomorrow: analysts are
forecasting group net profit growth of 60 per cent or more, and a higher
dividend.
SMH registered shares put on another SFr8.50 to SFr216 in response to the
co-operation with Mercedes Benz on the Swatchmobile city car project.
MADRID dealers said that the country's own news - a 25-point cut in base
rate - was already discounted, and the equity market lost some of its gains
on the US weakness to close with the general index 3.23 higher at 342.85 in
turnover of Pta33bn.
Repsol rose Pta85 to Pta4,645 after an 11 per cent rise in net profits, but
Tabacalera dropped Pta85 to Pta4,015 before after-hours news of a fall in
parent company profits for 1993.
BRUSSELS took its lead from other bourses as the Bel-20 index ended 7.12
higher at 1,511.47 in turnover of some BFr1.62bn.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul begins to claw back losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Istanbul has begun to claw back some of the losses seen since the start of
the year, although its volatility was reflected in a 5 per cent decline
earlier this week.
With the recent selling led by domestic investors, the international
investment community has been keeping a watching brief on developments.
Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's director of global strategy, reckons the
time has now come to re-enter the Turkish equity market.
Consequently he has lifted the country's weighting in Morgan Stanley's
emerging markets model portfolio to 10 per cent, against a benchmark of 2
per cent.
'The cause of the panic was a credit rating downgrade, a run on the
currency, the resignation of the governor of the central bank, soaring
short-term interest rates (the overnight rate reached 600 per cent at one
point) and a loss of confidence in the prime minister,' he reiterates.
'The devaluation of the currency was mishandled, but necessary,' Mr Biggs
goes on to say. Turkey suffered from a 70 per cent inflation rate last year,
and this led to overvaluation of the lira.
'Naturally,' he concludes, 'exports stagnated and imports boomed, resulting
in the trade deficit going from Dollars 7.7bn in 1992 to Dollars 13.8bn.
'The devaluation has restored Turkey's competitiveness, and the stock market
should be going up, not down. I think it will once the crisis eases and
short-term interest rates start falling.'
Last week's biggest faller was Brazil, a trend that has been reversed this
week.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei subdued as Kuala
Lumpur surges 3.3 per cent

<TEXT>
Activity remained subdued on the last trading day for February settlements,
and share prices edged lower after hovering within a narrow range, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average lost 0.80 at 19,341.83 after a high of 19,466.95 and
low of 19,323.93. Small-lot index-linked trading by dealers and
institutional investors dominated activity after the yen strengthened to the
Y104 level to the dollar, raising uncertainty over the course of the
Japanese currency. Traders said fears of arbitrage unwinding also depressed
sentiment.
The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 5.68 up at 1,577.85 and
the Nikkei 300 rose 1.24 to 291.83. Volume totalled 270m shares, against
325m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 9.04 at 1,318.53.
The yen closed at Y104.65, up Y1.30, as many market participants focused on
Saturday's meeting of top finance officials of the group of seven leading
industrial nations in Frankfurt. In spite of active selling of the yen by
the Bank of Japan, the domestic currency rose on buying by US fund managers
and bank dealers.
Fanuc, a leading machine tool equipment maker, fell Y200 to Y4,090 following
reports that Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura
Securities, had downgraded its rating on the company, saying that the stock
would underperform the Nikkei index.
Retailers were firm on buying by individuals hoping for an earnings rebound
due to the income tax cut next fiscal year. Mitsukoshi, the department
store, jumped Y37 to Y882 and Jusco, the supermarket chain, advanced Y60 to
Y2,340.
Navix Line, a shipping company, was the most active issue of the day,
climbing Y18 to Y363 on buying by overseas investors.
Multimedia shares gained ground. Toshiba rose Y12 to Y738 and Fujitsu Y10 to
Y1,020. Cable makers were also higher, with Furukawa Electric up Y9 to Y704.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y5,000 at Y939,000, while Victor, the
consumer electronics maker, put on Y90 at Y1,130 on hopes of an earnings
rise.
Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y21 to Y873 on profit-taking by individual
investors. Mining stocks had been higher last month on buying by short term
traders, in tandem with firmer gold prices.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 49.24 to 21,437.09 in quiet trading.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets put in mostly positive performances.
KUALA LUMPUR posted a 3.3 per cent rise on retail and foreign buying which
continued to be focused on second line stocks, and particularly
rumour-driven issues. The composite index added 36.60 at 1,141.05.
Arab-Malaysian Development, rumoured to be a takeover target, forged ahead
18 cents, or 5.4 per cent, to MDollars 3.50 in volume of 32m shares. Mulpha
International surged 70 cents, or 11.2 per cent, to MDollars 6.95 on
continued talk of a port privatisation deal.
SINGAPORE was supported by foreign institutional buying in response to what
was viewed as a pro-business national budget released just before the market
closed.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 23.55 to 2,423.91. Some
institutional buying in properties was noted, with Singapore Land gaining 35
cents at SDollars 7.60. A cut in the commercial property tax rate is
expected to boost some property stocks with commercial property exposure.
HONG KONG finished well off the day's highs after some profits were taken.
The Hang Seng index was finally 89.22 ahead at 10,763.23 after a peak for
the session of 10,815.
Among blue chips attracting interest after the recent bear run, Henderson
Land advanced HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 49.25 and Cheung Kong appreciated
25 cents to HKDollars 45.25.
AUSTRALIA climbed on the combination of US interest rate prospects and
upcoming options expiry, the All Ordinaries index closing 16.4 up at 2,218.9
in ADollars 510m turnover.
Among blue chips, BHP rose 16 cents to ADollars 18.36 and News Corp 6 cents
to ADollars 10.22. CRA was 28 cents higher at ADollars 18.20.
NEW ZEALAND took its lead from Wall Street's performance and the NZSE 40
Capital index moved ahead 47.60 to 2,265.24. Ceramco weakened 35 cents to
NZDollars 6.50 on news that 1994 profits are likely to be less than earlier
forecast.
TAIWAN reversed early losses to close higher in a rebound from four straight
days of falls.
Institutional bargain hunting in a wide range of stocks helped the weighted
index improve 35.28 to 5,769.19, although turnover remained thin at TDollars
43.14bn, against Tuesday's TDollars 41.53bn.
KARACHI gained ground on heavy foreign buying, with energy, chemical and
bank issues leading the rally.
The KSE 100 index rose 47.53 to 2,455.11, and dealers said that funds were
encouraged by a positive government policy on privatisation.
BOMBAY fell but sellers withdrew, hoping that they could get improved prices
in the two trading days left before Monday's national budget. The BSE index
ended 56.11 lower at 4,028.78.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar finishes higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rumour that the US and Japan had agreed to a lower yen helped to boost the
value of the dollar yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
In an otherwise quiet day in foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose by
more than Y2 to a mid-morning high of Y106.55 in European trading as talk
circulated that Japan and the US had agreed on a Y110 target for the dollar.
The US currency later fell back as the market discounted the rumour, and
finished in London at Y105.525, a little over a yen higher than the Y104.40
level where it was trading early yesterday. It ended in New York last night
at Y105.70.
There was little movement in Europe, with the D-Mark slightly weaker. It
finished unchanged against the French franc in London at FFr3.398.
Sterling also had a quiet day, ending marginally softer against the D-Mark -
DM2.5513 from DM2.5531 on Tuesday - and the dollar  - Dollars 1.4766 against
Dollars 1.4785.
The origin of the frenzied mid-morning sale of yen was a newsagency report
suggesting that the US and Japan had agreed a Y110 target for the
dollar/yen. Adding fuel to the fire was talk of the Bank of England
intervening on behalf of the Bank of Japan. Neither rumour was confirmed.
Later the dollar fell a yen to Y105.50 after Reuters flashed a Japanese
'senior monetary source' saying that such a currency agreement was unlikely,
currency levels being the domain of the market rather than governments.
Analysts agreed that the sharp movement reflected the nervousness of the
market ahead of the weekend G7 meeting. 'It was indicative of the fact that
the market is concerned that you could actually see something agreed at the
G7 meeting,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in
London.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, responded positively to the
comments of a senior Japanese offic-ial that there might be lee-way on the
issue of trade targets. 'Those were pleasant words, but clearly we want
action,' said Mr Brown.
There was little response in foreign exchange markets to comments made by Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, in his Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to Congress on Tuesday.
The gist of his comments, which were successful in calming nerves in jittery
bond markets, was that inflation was under control. He said the next
movement in interest rates was likely to be up, but gave no indication that
this was imminent.
Attention has now shifted to the release today of January durable goods
orders. Mr Cunningham said this had previously been one of Mr Greenspan's
favourite leading indicators, in spite of its volatility. He did not,
however, expect it to be used as an excuse for tightening.
The German currency had an uneventful day, with most attention focused on
the dollar/yen. One area for comment was the Bundesbank's generous repo. The
central bank allotted DM82.5bn at a fixed rate of 6.0 per cent, adding a net
DM10.3bn to the market at the repo tender.
Some dealers said the cash injection could be a sign that the central bank
was prepar-ing the way for a return next week to a variable tender, which
would indicate a willingness to ease monetary policy.
Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Discount, said, however, that it
was more likely a reflection of technical factors to do with end of the
month minimum reserve requirements. Mr Shaw said he would be surprised if
the Bundesbank set a fixed rate repo next week.
He added that the central bank's monetary policy would probably be
determined in the short term by the outcome of the labour dispute in the
engineering industry.
The D-Mark has recently been under pressure following fears that the dispute
involving IG Metall, the country's largest union, might escalate and cause
damage. Recent indications are that the union is seeking to avoid conflict.
The Bank of Spain cut its key money rate to 8.50 per cent from 8.75 per cent
at the regular repurchase tender for central bank certificates. This was
discounted in the market as Spain had already reduced its intervention rate
on Friday.
The Bank of France monetary council is not expected to announce an easing of
policy when it meets today. 'I think they would like to see a cut in the
German repo rate first and then more than match it,' said Mr Keith Edmonds,
chief analyst at IBJ International.
The Bank of England said it would provide a total of Pounds 2.194bn in its
sale and repurchase facilities commencing on February 24. The interest rate
of 5 5/32 per cent is in line with repos in its regular money market
operations.
In its daily operations yesterday the central bank provided Pounds 600m of
late assistance, taking total assistance for the day to Pounds 978m,
compared to a final forecast of a Pounds 1.3bn shortage.
The Bank did not operate in the early round of bill offers, and this pushed
the overnight rate to an intraday high of 8.5 per cent.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: South African gold mines steer
round the rocks - The strategies of survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African gold mining output in 1993 is estimated at 622 tonnes, an
increase of more than 1 per cent from 1992 and its highest level since 1986.
That ranks as something of an achievement in an industry for which a sharp
decline was forecast by some pundits when many mines struggled to survive
rising costs and flat rand gold prices from 1988 to 1992.
The loss of tens of thousands of jobs, productivity improvements, the rand's
fall against the dollar and increasingly complex use of derivatives to
assure gold revenue have enabled all but two large producers to stay in
business.
Industry results for the final quarter of 1993 showed, however, that
survival could come at a cost. Some mines missed out on the full benefit of
bullion's rally in 1993 as they locked in prices for part of their output at
levels well below the spot level, while others began belatedly to catch up
on capital spending neglected when the gold price was at its lowest.
Although the industry has survived one of the worst periods in its history
largely intact the mines have entered a new era of caution. The shift has
been slow but Mr Dennis Tucker, gold mining analyst at stockbrokers Martin &amp;
Co, believes it is distinct. 'The mining houses crossed a threshold with the
decisions in the past 18 months to develop new mines like Moab, South Deep
and Target as add-on rather than stand-alone projects,' he says.
Moab, providing replacement tonnage for Anglo American's Vaal Reefs at a
current cost of R1.7bn (USDollars 500m), is the farthest advanced of the
projects. Anglovaal is developing the Target prospect from its marginal,
short-life Loraine mine, from which it will in turn be able to develop its
Sun prospect. The group decided in 1992 not to go ahead with the R2.5bn Sun
project on its own, citing the uncertainty surrounding domestic politics and
the gold market.
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment has been developing South Deep from the
neighbouring Western Areas mine slowly, carefully exploring the gold-bearing
reef from underground, rather than sinking a new shaft, which would cost at
least R2bn.
'South Africa has little chance of seeing a repeat of past gold mining booms
because of the geological maturity of the gold fields and unpredictability
of gold prices,' says Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo's gold
and uranium division.
There is little prospect of discovering a new geologically well-defined
field such as the ageing Evander region east of Johannesburg. What areas are
left have difficult orebodies, likely to be exploited only with gold's price
above R50,000 a kilogram (Dollars 450 a troy ounce) and significant
technological improvements, Mr Hewitt adds.
He notes that expensive delays suffered by two now cash-strapped developing
mines, Gencor's Oryx and JCI's Joel, have had a sobering effect on the
industry, underscoring the high risks that come with deep-level mining. Much
of the country's gold output is being extracted from more than 3,000 metres
underground.
With little chance of fiscal incentives to reduce the risk of investment in
new projects - local mining tax, at an effective 40 per cent, is higher than
in Australia, Canada or the US - given the demands of reconstruction and
development, Mr Bernard van Rooyen, recently retired as Gold Fields
executive director responsible for new business, sees South African gold
production declining by about 20 per cent in the years ahead to 450 to 500
tonnes a year. However, there are extensive ore reserves at depth on the
periphery of many of the high-grade gold prices that will prove lucrative
with productivity improvements, a better labour relations climate and more
consistent use of appropriate technology.
'No other country has a gold mining industry which while more than a century
old can boast that it has at least 30 years of mineable ore reserves left,'
says Mr van Rooyen.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU official warns of German
threat to Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restoration of the costly 'switchover' mechanism for European farm prices
could jeopardise the peace clause agreed in the December Gatt deal, a senior
European Commission official said yesterday.
The commission is strongly resisting German pressure to resurrect the
mechanism, part of the 'green money' system which translates Ecu-based
support prices into national currencies. With switchover, every realignment
of currencies pushes up farm prices in all member states in line with the
rise in the strongest currency, usually the D-Mark.
The German government wants the mechanism, in abeyance since last August, to
be restored to protect its farmers from losing income when the D-Mark is
revalued. The future of the farm currency system will be decided under the
German presidency of the EU in the second half of the year.
Mr Jim Cloos, chef de cabinet to Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture
commissioner, said the cost and inflationary impact of switchover 'run
counter to the main thrust of the (common agricultural policy) reform, that
is, a reduction of production.'
'They also have a damaging effect on our competitiveness, reduce our margin
of manoeuvre as regards internal support and could impair the application of
the peace clause,' he told a conference organised by Agra Europe (London)
entitled 'Outlook '94'.
The peace clause prevents Gatt signatories from challenging each other's
agricultural systems, such as the CAP, for nine years from the start of the
deal next year.
Mr Cloos said the Gatt agreement would not require 'any significant
additional efforts' by European farmers over and above the 1992 common
agricultural policy reform, provided reform remained on track. The 'green'
currency question was one of the major threats to the reform, he said.
'It is understandable that governments want to protect their farmers from
the full thrust of currency fluctuations. It is less so to totally insulate
them from monetary realities which impose themselves on all other sectors of
the economy.'
Addressing Europe's commitments under the six-year Gatt deal, Mr Cloos said
the reduction in subsidised cereals exports to 25.9m tonnes in 2000 might
cause constraints. Projections put the exportable surplus of cereals close
to 25m tonnes at that date, he said. But this assumes 1 per cent annual
growth in yields, which some experts think is too low.
Mr Brian Gardner, managing director of EPA Associates, a Brussels-based food
consultancy, told the conference CAP reform was unlikely to reduce budgetary
expenditure, given that the profitability of most European farming depended
on continuing compensation for cuts in support prices.
'If agricultural expenditure continues to exceed the budgetary limits, there
is a likelihood that there could be a concerted attempt to cut back on the
compensatory payments in the later years of a Gatt agreement,' he said.
Mr Cloos said the Commission was investigating two payment schemes to French
pig producers, not just one, as Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture
minister, asserted earlier this week. Britain has complained about the
payments, saying they amount to unfair state aid which is damaging the UK
pig industry.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metal prices rally from
morning lows - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals managed to move off their lows by the end of a generally
uninspiring day's London Metal Exchange trading, although prices still
finished lower.
Three months delivery ALUMINIUM fluctuated around Dollars 1,300 a tonne for
most of the afternoon, with speculative buying helping to prevent a serious
downside move.
COPPER never fully recovered from falling below a key chart level at Dollars
1,885, although the resulting stop-loss selling was not so heavy as to cause
a serious breakdown.
LEAD perked up during the final minutes of the after hours trading session,
although it still ended Dollars 12 down.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE lost nearly all the advance made in
the morning on reports that the Brazilian government was prepared to help
with the coffee sector's financing.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further cocoa deficits forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world cocoa market could see three further years of production deficits,
two of surplus and then another two years of shortfalls, according to a
paper drawn up by the secretariat of the International Cocoa Organisation
(ICCO), reports Reuter.
The paper was discussed yesterday at the first council session of the new
cocoa agreement.
Earlier this month, the ICCO projected a production deficit of 110,000
tonnes in 1993-94 (October-September), which would be the third in
succession. This deficit could grow to 209,000 tonnes in 1994-95 and then be
reduced to 135,000 tonnes in 1995-96 and 31,000 tonnes in 1996-97, the paper
suggested. Two years of small production surpluses of 30,000 tonnes and
18,000 tonnes were then likely, followed in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 by
shortfalls of 41,000 tonnes and 95,000 tonnes.
'Cocoa prices. . . are projected to continue to show significant gains over
the next two years. A noticeable consequence of the price rises is that
growth in the world consumption of cocoa. . . is expected to be arrested and
may even suffer a decline after the 1994-95 season,' the paper said.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India enchanted by mushroom
magic - Output could grow by 800% in three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dark brown morel mushrooms that grow wild in the coniferous hill forests
of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and
Kashmir were until recently a delicacy reserved to the local tribes -
because only they could tell the poisonous from the edible ones.
But Delhi traders have now changed all that. Realising the tremendous export
potential of this delicious fungus they have persuaded the state governments
to auction sections of forest land to them, so that they can reap the morels
with the help of the tribesmen and export them to the US, Switzerland,
Germany and France.
These traders are not alone in eyeing the fast-expanding global market for
mushrooms. Keen to encourage agri-businesses, the Indian government is in
the process of clearing over 20 joint ventures between Indian and foreign
companies to cultivate mushrooms in India, primarily for the export market.
The government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board has received investment
proposals worth over Rs290bn (Pounds 6.25bn) for the food processing
industry, many of them for mushroom cultivation.
Large foreign agri-business companies, including the Dutch giants, Dalsam
Veciep, Haegens, and Genssen Kessel, Monterey Mushrooms of the US, and
Turatti of Italy have already found Indian partners to set up mushroom
cultivations and canning facilities at locations across the country.
India, the world's second-largest producer of vegetables (after China) and
fruit (after Brazil), has only recently realised the tremendous export
potential of the mushroom.
Mushroom cultivation last year accounted for only 3,500 of the 45m tonnes of
vegetables produced, but the government says output will increase to over
30,000 tonnes in the next three years. Increased exports would then yield at
least Rs1bn annually. The government expects at least 12 of the proposed
projects to be set up in the next three years, each producing between 3,000
and 4,000 tonnes a year. Almost all India's existing mushroom farmers run
small-scale units, growing the white button, oyster and paddystraw
varieties.
Although mushroom farming is comparatively new in India investors are being
attracted by abundant and cheap labour - mushrooms have to be picked and
sorted by hand. Compost like chicken manure and paddystraw, which is an
essential requirement for mushroom cultivation, is also easily available.
Most companies will cultivate white button mushrooms, which have a world
market share of nearly 40 per cent. Though hilly areas provide the best
climate for button mushrooms, more and more growers prefer using greenhouses
in urban areas, to facilitate transport and distribution. Mushrooms are
highly perishable, and the domestic market for them is negligible.
'We are very keen to invite foreign investment in this area because improved
technology and state-of-the-art processing machinery could make India an
important mushroom centre,' says an official in the government's ministry of
food processing industries. 'Few mushroom farmers can afford the Rs200,000
it takes to set up a greenhouse unit,' he adds.
As part of its efforts to boost mushroom exports, the Indian government has
approached the European Union for a quota, to save the additional customs
duty levied on third-world countries without a quota. 'Our mushroom exports
have been so negligible, we did not need a quota,' the official says. 'But
we soon will, unless the quota system is abolished altogether.'
Foreign investors, some of whom have applied for permission to set up as
many as five plants in different locations, say that the quality of the
mushrooms available in the Indian market needs to be improved to be able to
compete in the world market. Planting material and processing equipment for
freeze-drying, dehydrating, pickling and deep-freezing will have to be
imported.
'The largest names in the business will soon be here, but we have to ensure
that with them comes the technology and research and development input it
takes to make Indian mushrooms global,' says Mr CK Basu, an official in the
food processing industries ministry.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: European sector consolidates but remains
nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

European government bonds continued to consolidate, but market sentiment
remained jittery and investors were keeping a low profile following the
recent sharp sell-off.
'The mood is still nervous and uncertain, and it would be very justifiable
to remain cautious,' said Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss Bank
Corporation.
Uncertainty over the pace of German easing continues to overhang the
markets. While the Bundesbank last week cut its discount rate by  1/2 point,
it left its more important repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent.
Most observers agree that a cut in that rate would kick off another leg in
the bond rally, which is still seen as justified by Europe's economic
fundamentals. However, a cut in German rates is seen to hinge on the
resolution of the labour dispute in the German engineering sector, and
inflation and money-supply data.
'Until these factors are out of the way, European markets will remain very
exposed to the US market,' said Mr Hall.
While UK gilts ended lower, dragged down by their European counterparts,
traders said the auction of Pounds 2.5bn 7 per cent gilts due 2001 went
smoothly. The auction was covered 1.48 times, with a tail (the difference
between the highest and average accepted yields) of 6 basis points. While
the cover was in line with expectations, news of the long tail caused prices
to dip briefly. Recent auctions have rarely had a tail of more than 2 basis
points.
However, prices soon retraced their losses as little follow-through selling
emerged, and dealers said the new supply was absorbed with relative ease.
German bunds rose initially on a larger-than-expected liquidity injection at
the Bundesbank's repo allocation, but erased their gains in the afternoon to
end slightly lower. The March bund contract on Liffe stood at 97.74 late in
the day, down 0.09 point on the day.
'Technically we're still in a downward trend, and the fundamental situation
isn't promising either,' said a Frankfurt bund dealer, pointing to the
imminent release of January M3 money supply data.
Although the market is discounting a bad number, he said M3 could knock
prices sharply lower if it had been boosted not only by typical seasonal
factors but by growth in the underlying components, such as credit
expansion.
In the French bond market, curve-steepening trades put pressure on the long
end and underpinned the short end. Ahead of next week's 10 and 30-year
auctions and amid hopes for a near-term interest-rate cut, that trend is
likely to continue, a Paris trader said.
US bond prices went into a sharp downturn yesterday after the Treasury's
monthly auction of two-year securities drew little demand.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 lower
at 94 29/32 , with the yield rising to 6.641 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was off  3/16 to 98 13/16 , to yield 4.631 per cent.
The Treasury awarded the Dollars 17bn issue of new two-year paper at a yield
of 4.66 per cent, about 2 basis points higher than expectations, when the
auction failed to generate sufficient interest to warrant the lower rate of
return.
The lack of aggressive bidding came on the heels of renewed concern over the
timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to boost short-term interest
rates. Near midday, prices on the long end of the yield curve dropped amid
speculation that the Fed would lift its Fed Funds target following the
release of January durable goods data today.
In his testimony before a congressional committee on Tuesday, the Fed
chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, said trends in durable goods orders were a
valuable tool in forecasting inflation.
Early in yesterday's session, the fixed-income markets appeared to have been
reassured by the overall tone of Mr Greenspan's comments. As a result,
prices drifted lower in thin trading before jitters over interest rates
resurfaced in the hours before the note auction.

Moody's Investor Service may have to downgrade some of its existing credit
ratings on French local authorities, Reuter reports from Paris.
The US credit rating agency said the credit quality of the local authorities
should remain good. However, their high debt ratings should in no way be
considered by investors as reflecting Moody's opinion on the average
financial strength of 'territorial communities' in France, the agency
stressed.
'Reduced financial elasticity to future stresses may lead to moderate
downgrades of some of the existing ratings, but most of the rated French
communities should be able to preserve institutional and financial
characteristics compatible with the Aa rating range,' it said.
Moody's has ascribed ratings to six French local authorities - Ile-de-France
(Aaa), Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (Aa2), Alpes-Maritimes (Aa2), Essone
(Aa1), Hauts-de-Seine (Aaa) and Seine-et-Marne (Aa1).

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Asian bank offering priced to ensure
smooth launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent volatility in financial markets prompted the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) to give up a few basis points to ensure a smooth launch for its
first global bond offering yesterday.
Although the Dollars 750m, 10-year issue was priced to yield 18 basis points
over comparable US Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 18
to 20 basis points, this was slightly above some market expectations of a
yield spread of 16 basis points.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly, according
to joint lead manager Salomon Brothers. Other banks involved in the deal
said the strongest bid for the bonds was from Asia.
Mr Peter Balon, the ADB's senior treasury officer, said the offering was
oversubscribed and that the pricing reflected his desire to see some
performance in the bonds. The liquidity and the current coupon, as well as
the narrow bid-offer spread, also offered investors an alternative to US
Treasuries, he said.
Yesterday's offering, which accounts for one-quarter of the ADB's Dollars
2.8bn borrowing programme for fiscal 1994, marks a shift in the bank's
funding strategy. Mr Balon said the ADB planned to make at least one global
bond offering a year and he noted that yesterday's deal showed that global
bond offerings could be done successfully for Dollars 750m. The market has
so far regarded Dollars 1bn as the minimum size for a successful global bond
offering.
Mr Balon said the ADB's next large bond issue would be denominated in yen
but that it also planned some Eurobond transactions and issues in the local
Asian markets, including an offering in Taiwanese dollars.
The two other notable deals of the day were from corporate issuers.
TransAtlantic Holdings, the life assurance and property group which reported
its 1993 results yesterday, raised Pounds 250m through an offering of
15-year convertible bonds.
An official at lead manager UBS said although the conversion premium on the
bonds of 12 per cent was below average, the coupon of 5 1/2 per cent was the
lowest to date on conventional Eurosterling convertible bonds. He added that
the recent rise in UK government bond yields might prompt more companies to
tap the convertible bond market before long.
Eridania Beghin-Say, the sugar subsidiary of Ferruzzi Finanziaria of Italy,
launched a FFr1.5bn issue of eight-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which were priced to yield 72 basis points over the interpolated
yield curve for French government bonds, appealed to investors, mainly
French institutions, who were familiar with the name and who were aware of
the problems facing the issuer's parent.
Elsewhere, Nafinsa of Mexico became the first Latin American borrower to tap
the dragon bond market. Its Dollars 250m offering of five-year floating-rate
notes had a discounted margin of 102.7 basis points over Libor. Ispat, a
Mexican steel company, is due to raise Dollars 175m through an offering of
seven-year Eurobonds today, via CS First Boston.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: International banks pushed to
diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slackness of international bank credit over the last three years has
prompted international banks to diversify their sources of revenue through
the underwriting and trading of securities, fund management and the offering
of new services involving derivative products, the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) says in its latest report* on the sector.
It adds that the trend has been reinforced in recent periods by the
volatility of interest and exchange rates which has led to greater demand
from the non-bank sector for hedging and investment services.
Although there was a strong recovery in reporting banks' gross international
claims, from a Dollars 106bn fall in the second quarter last year to a
Dollars 183bn rise in the third quarter, new credit totalled a mere Dollars
5bn in the third quarter, down from Dollars 40bn the previous quarter. The
BIS said this reflected weak demand for funds in the reporting area and an
absolute contraction in banks' claims on all other groups of countries,
except Asia.
The continuing weakness of loan demand from high-quality borrowers also led
to a reduction in new international syndicated credit facilities, to Dollars
49.9bn in the fourth quarter from Dollars 54.1bn in the third, and
accentuated the downward pressure on lending margins.
'While this does not appear to have been reflected so far in reduced spreads
for lower-quality names, there was reportedly some evidence of banks'
increasing willingness to lend to such customers,' the BIS said in the
report.
The report highlighted the rising popularity of Euro-MTN programmes which
accounted for 31 per cent of all net issues of Euro-notes and international
bonds in the fourth quarter. It added that net new issuance reached a
near-record level in the Euro-note market and a peak in the international
bond market, at Dollars 24.8bn and Dollars 56.7bn respectively.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Microsoft ordered to pay patents
damages
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the big US software group, has been ordered to pay Dollars 120m
in damages for infringement of data compression patents held by Stac
Electronics, a small software company. The ruling could have broad
consequences for the personal computer industry.
Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system, MS-DOS 6.0,
contains data compression features that infringe patents held by Stac, a Los
Angeles court has ruled.
The costs of the ruling could be much higher if Microsoft is forced to halt
sales of MS-DOS, even temporarily. Stac said that it would immediately seek
a permanent injunction against Microsoft to prevent further infringement.
The patent infringement ruling could affect the entire industry. Most
personal computers are shipped with Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system
software pre-installed. Technically, any sales subsequent to the court
ruling could constitute further patent infringement.
Stac Electronics' data compression technology doubles the amount of data
that can be stored on a personal computer hard disk file.
Doug Clow, president and chief executive of Stac Electronics said he held
licensing negotiations with Microsoft in 1992, but the companies had been
unable to reach agreement. Subsequently, Microsoft introduced MS-DOS 6.0, a
new version of its PC operating system that includes data compression
technology.
The court ruled that Microsoft's data compression method infringed Stac's
patents. However, the jury determined that the infringement was not
'wilful'.
The court also awarded damages of Dollars 13.6m to Microsoft, for Stac's use
of trade secrets relating to 'undocumented' features of MS-DOS. Mr Clow said
Stac had 'reverse engineered' an element of Microsoft's product to make its
data compression software compatible with MS-DOS.

scheme

<TEXT>
United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday received a setback to its
proposed employee buy-out when the labour union representing 18,000 flight
attendants said it would not take part in the scheme.
However, United has already won agreement from its other 63,000 union and
non-union employees. It is expected to proceed with plans to put the scheme
before shareholders in May or June, with a strong recommendation for
approval.
Under the scheme, drawn up in December by United Airline's management and
the pilots' and machinists' unions, employees are due to receive a 53 per
cent controlling stake in the airline in return for Dollars 5bn worth of
wage cuts and other labour concessions over the next six years.
The Association of Flight Attendants was not a party to the agreement
because it walked out of talks earlier in the year. The protest was over
suggestions that some attendants could be replaced by cheaper, foreign-based
staff.
Yesterday, the association said it believed agreement could be reached on
United's plan to set up a low-cost airline-within-an-airline - dubbed U2 -
to handle domestic short-haul flights. However, it could not accept any
agreement that did not address the issue of foreign domiciles, and what it
termed 'the airline's discriminatory flight attendant weight programme' - a
reference to company rules on maximum weights for cabin staff.

A consortium of Leucadia National Corp of the US and Argentina's Werthein
family is to pay Dollars 85m cash for 60 per cent of state-owned insurance
company and savings bank, Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro (CNAS). Its sale
represents one of Argentina's last big privatisations.
CNAS dominates the local insurance industry, with a 12.5 per cent share of
the market, and its savings bank has assets of Dollars 350m.
The Werthein family controls privately-held Banco Mercantil Argentino, a
middle-ranking commercial bank, and will own 30 per cent of the Caja.
Leucadia will hold another 30 per cent. They will take control of CNAS in
mid-March.
The government plans to float a further 30 per cent of the company on local
and international stock exchanges, but no date has yet been fixed.
The remaining 10 per cent will be held by the employee share ownership
scheme.
In the past three years, Argentina has sold nearly all its state companies,
raising Dollars 9bn in cash and retiring Dollars 10bn in debt.

division

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US car manufacturer, announced yesterday that it will sell its
Mexico-based Acustar electrical wiring division to a newly formed US
subsidiary of Yazaki Corporation, one of its Japanese component suppliers.
After the sale is completed, Chrysler said it would enter a supply agreement
to purchase wire products manufactured by the Yazaki unit.
The terms of the deal were not revealed, but the Acustar wire division,
which has almost all of its 11,000 employees based in eight assembly plants
in Mexico, had sales worth approximately Dollars 300m in 1993.
Industry analysts estimated that the deal was worth anything between Dollars
25m and Dollars 100m.
In selling Acustar, Chrysler is following the lead of Ford and foreign car
companies, which have been recently selling their low-tech, labour-intensive
component manufacturing operations to specialist suppliers.
Chrysler said that one of the motives behind the sale was that it would
allow Acustar to achieve Mexican national supplier status, which makes it
easier for the operation to sell its products in the Mexican market.
This will benefit Chrysler's subsidiary in Mexico, the company said, because
by buying wiring components manufactured by a Mexican supplier, Chrysler
will be entitled to receive more export credits from the Mexican government.

<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz has attributed savings of DM1bn (Dollars 588m) to a new
'partnership' with its suppliers.
At the company's factory at Sindelfingen near Stuttgart, Mr Manfred Remmel,
a director, said costs of certain supplies had dropped by up to 40 per cent
since Mercedes sought to forge a new relationship with its suppliers.
Mercedes, through its so-called Tandem programme, has hammered out 300
projects with suppliers to reduce costs, develop products and improve
quality, Mr Remmel explained.
He drew an unspoken parallel with the aggressive cost-cutting 'hit-squads'
operated by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, purchasing director at
Volkswagen. These have been the focus of criticism within the German car
components industry.
'Our co-operation lives from dialogue, not diktat,' the Mercedes executive
said.
However, he made clear the achievements of the past year were not enough to
eliminate the German automotive industry's cost disadvantages against
foreign, especially Japanese, manufacturers.
When the cost-reduction process began last year, the Japanese enjoyed a 30
per cent cost advantage. The gap had narrowed, but manufacturers and
suppliers had to continue their efforts to become more efficient, Mr Remmel
said.
The drive to cut the costs of supplies was part of Mercedes' broader
cost-cutting strategy. Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes chief executive, explained
recently that a combination of measures - chiefly staff reduction - had
reduced costs by DM4bn last year.
The aim is to close the gap with Japanese suppliers by 1998, he said.
Last month he said to reduce further the cost of supplies - which amounted
to DM19bn last year at the company's 13 production sites in Germany - the
company could buy a higher percentage of components from foreign suppliers.
German components suppliers have been under intense pressure. Mr Konrad
Ellegast, deputy chairman of Phoenix, one of the companies involved in the
Tandem project, said yesterday very few companies in the sector made a
profit last year. Bankruptcies in the sector would continue this year.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: US drugs group signs hospital
contract

Abbott Laboratories, the Illinois-based healthcare company, yesterday signed
a Dollars 500m contract with SunHealth Alliance of Charlotte, North
Carolina. The move adds momentum to the US trend of creating package deals
for US health service suppliers.
The agreement includes pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, drug delivery systems,
intravenous solutions, nutritionals, medical-surgical products, critical
care and anaesthesia products.
The 280-hospital five-year deal is the latest in a series which usually
involves big discounts for the purchasers in return for preferential buying
from one supplier such as Abbott.
In August 1993, US healthcare company Bristol-Myers Squibb signed a
five-year contract to set up preferred status for its products with American
Healthcare Systems of San Diego, California. AHS has more than 1,000
hospitals, and the deal was one of the biggest yet signed.
These arrangements represent an alternative approach to that followed by
Merck, the biggest drugs company in the US, which in July 1993 paid Dollars
6bn for drugs distributor Medco Containment Services.
These deals respond to changing healthcare markets, and anticipate the
reform of healthcare proposed by the Clinton administration.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Old colonial captain to take
controls at Aerolineas - Iberia's loans to the Argentine flag-carrier will
convert to a majority equity share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three-year crisis surrounding the privatisation of Aerolneas Argentinas
may now be close to a solution.
The governments of Argentina and Spain are expected to announce soon that
Iberia, the Spanish national airline, will complete its takeover of
Aerolneas by lifting its stake to 85 per cent from 30 per cent.
This will wipe out about Dollars 700m in loans Iberia has advanced
Aerolneas.
Both sides in the often bitter dispute say the new arrangement puts
Aerolneas on a sound financial footing, and will allow Iberia to push ahead
with modernisation of the struggling airline.
The roots of the convoluted tussle go back to November 1990, when Iberia led
a consortium of local investors that paid Dollars 1.87bn in a cash and
debt-for-equity package for 85 per cent of Aerolneas. However, before the
ink on the contract had dried, Iberia discovered that its Argentine partners
were insolvent.
Then, a disagreement with the government over payment terms escalated into
an angry confrontation that ended with renegotiation of the contract. This
required the government to partially re-nationalise Aerolneas, increasing
its shareholding to 33 per cent from 5 per cent.
Iberia, however, failed to improve Aerolneas's performance. It has had to
pump almost Dollars 700m into the company since 1990 to keep it flying. Last
year, Iberia demanded that the government contribute its share of a Dollars
500m capital increase to shore up Aerolneas's balance sheet.
The refusal by the Argentine economy minister Domingo Cavallo to put any
more money into Aerolneas sparked a new confrontation with Iberia.
Iberia threatened to walk away from Aerolneas unless the government joined
in the capital-raising exercise. In the end, Mr Cavallo decided to allow
Iberia to convert its Dollars 700m loans into equity, substantially diluting
the government's Aerolneas stake.
This required a change in the law to allow Iberia to take a majority share
in Aerolneas without altering its status as Argentina's national airline.
The deal also dilutes the stakes of minority shareholders, nearly all of
them Spanish and Argentine banks, with 27 per cent of the company. However,
these banks merely served as a front for Iberia, whose stake in Aerolneas
was previously limited to 49 per cent.
Once the new arrangement is in place, the government's stake will be cut to
5 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent of Aerolneas will be held by the
employees' share ownership scheme.
Originally, the government wanted to sell its unwanted shares to private
Argentine investors. However, it failed to find any serious buyers.
Investor aversion to Aerolneas is hardly surprising. Not only is it a
chronic lossmaker, but any fresh investor cash would go to Iberia.
Furthermore, investors did not want to risk money in Aerolneas as long as
Iberia remained in charge.
In its three years under Iberia, Aerolneas has lost almost Dollars 500m.
Last year's Dollars 223m net loss was 16 per cent more than in 1992, and
revenues fell 10 per cent to Dollars 1.02bn.
Despite Mr Cavallo's helpfulness in altering the shareholding regulations,
Mr Manuel Moran, an Iberia executive on secondment as Aerolneas's chairman,
complains the new rules could make his life harder by allowing foreign
competitors into the protected domestic market.
Still, he says Aerolneas's health is improving. He forecasts positive
cashflow this year, thanks to cost controls, a sales increase of almost
one-fifth, to Dollars 1.2bn, and recovering market share. He hopes to start
making money in 1995.
He wants to improve Aerolneas's poor performance on the important Miami
corridor by leasing smaller and more efficient jets to on the larger and
more efficient US competitors.
Integration with Iberia and its associated companies in South America,
notably Venezuela's Viasa will continue.
Mr Moran and his predecessors have made similar promises before. Mr Moran,
like previous Iberia executives, blames his difficulties on the government,
predatory competition, adverse market conditions, and hostile staff. In
private, government officials counter by maintaining that Aerolneas's
greatest problem is Iberia's poor management.
Wherever the blame lies, for an Argentina proud of its national symbols,
losing control of the flag-carrier to its old colonial master will be a
bitter blow.

options

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cadillac Fairview, Canada's biggest regional shopping centre owner, has
submitted a debt restructuring plan to its bankers and shareholders. It
proposes asset sales and possibly a public stock offer.
Fairview, once controlled by the Montreal Bronfmans, owns the country's
three leading downtown shopping malls, including the Eaton Centre in
Toronto.
It has suffered from plunging property values since 1990, and has long-term
debt of about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn), including CDollars 860m due to
its banking group in 1997.
Fairview was acquired by Chicago's JMB Realty in 1987 for CDollars 2.9bn,
and taken private. About 41 institutions, including many big North American
pension funds, injected CDollars 700m cash last year.
Mr Graham Eadie, president of Fairview, said the company had to consider
restructuring because of the drastic fall in property values. While there
was no urgent deadline, the options were selling assets or bringing in new
equity through a public offering.
Several Canadian property firms, such as Markborough and Cambridge Shopping
Centres, have raised well over CDollars 500m with stock and convertible
debenture issues in the past few months.
Mr Frank Mayer, analyst with BBN James Capel, said: 'The perception is that
shares of companies such as Fairview can only improve. There is a lot of
room for Canadian investment if an interesting deal is put together.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Boldly seeking aerospace
opportunities - Paul Betts finds McDonnell Douglas cash-rich and back on the
acquisition trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas is back on the acquisition trail to strengthen its core
defence aerospace activities. The US company is also seeking partners in
Europe and Asia for its commercial aircraft operations.
'Our improved financial strengths means we can be a buyer again. That was
not the case two or three years ago,' Mr John McDonnell, the US group's
chairman, said yesterday at the Singapore air show.
The group's net profit rose to USDollars 396m last year, from Dollars 79m in
1992, before exceptional items related to a new accounting standard for
pension benefits. It expects to continue showing 'strong earnings and
positive cashflow' in 1994, said Mr McDonnell.
This would enable the largest US defence contractor to seek acquisitions
offered by the growing consolidation of the US defence industry.
'We are not planning any diversification, but we are going to explore
possible acquisitions to strengthen our aerospace business. If it doesn't
fly we are not interested,' Mr McDonnell said.
The group would focus on opportunities in the US market because Mr McDonnell
believes the time is not yet right to form transnational defence companies.
Last week's announcement by President Bill Clinton of a Dollars 6bn order by
Saudi Arabia for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing commercial aircraft had also
boosted prospects for the company's Douglas commercial aircraft business.
The deal would enable Douglas to rebuild its backlog when it has seen its
commercial aircraft sales and production nose-dive during the past three
years.
Douglas produced only 40 commercial aircraft last year. Twin-engine aircraft
production alone has slumped from 138 aircraft in 1991 to 20 last year.
Despite the sharp drop, the commercial aircraft operations have made money
in the past three years, following extensive cost-cutting and restructuring.
They showed an operating profit of Dollars 40m last year, down from Dollars
102m in 1992. Mr McDonnell said they would again be cash-positive this year,
even though sales were continuing to decline.
However, he conceded the company needed to win more orders for 1996. 'If we
don't, we will have to cut production rates even further,' he warned.
Mr McDonnell said there were two alternative strategies for the commercial
aircraft business. The first was to strengthen the company in its existing
market segments by developing new derivatives of its 156-seat twin-engine
MD80 and MD90 airliners and its 300-seat MD11 three-engine long-range
aircraft.
'At present we are pursuing this strategy,' he said.
The alternative was an international alliance with partners from Europe and
Asia to enable Douglas to develop a broader family of aircraft to compete
across the board with Boeing and Airbus.
He said the company was in talks with 'a number of potential alliance
partners around the world', but declined to name them.
The company failed two years ago to forge a partnership with Taiwan
Aerospace after much-publicised negotiations involving the possible
USDollars 2bn acquisition by Taiwan of a 49 per cent stake in Douglas.
'We learnt our lesson. We are only going to say something this time when we
have something to announce,' he said.
One potential partner is Alenia, the Italian aerospace company controlled by
the Finmeccanica state engineering group. The Italian group confirmed this
week it was holding talks with McDonnell Douglas. Reports have indicated it
was interested in taking between a 10 and 20 per cent stake in Douglas.
As part of its strategy to develop new derivatives of existing commercial
aircraft products, Douglas announced yesterday it was introducing an
extended-range version of its MD11. This will increase the MD11's current
range by 480 nautical miles, to 7,210 nautical miles. The company is also
marketing a smaller 100-seat version of the MD90 twin-engine aircraft called
the MD95.
Mr McDonnell said the group would keep its helicopter activities, which it
had considered selling or putting into a joint venture. The helicopter
operations were no longer a separate subsidiary but had been successfully
integrated into the company's overall structure, Mr McDonnell said.
After shedding about 17,000 jobs last year, Mr McDonnell said the big job
restructuring was probably over, as long as the company's defence and civil
aerospace markets did not continue to decline significantly.

Canon, the Japanese camera and office equipment maker, has agreed to use US
computer group IBM's PowerPC microprocessor technology in future computer
products. It will also help refine technology for use in consumer products
and hand-held devices.
The Canon endorsement is a breakthrough for IBM, which aims to establish
PowerPC as an industry standard competing with Intel's microprocessor
technology. Canon is the first computer systems manufacturer, other than
Apple and IBM itself, to adopt PowerPC as a strategic technology.
The agreement does not entail Canon incorporating PowerPC in its printers,
cameras or copying machines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher first-half profits from its core building materials and products
division offset lower earnings from petroleum refining at Pioneer
International, and allowed the Sydney-based group to report a 15.2 per cent
increase in after-tax profits in the six months to end-December.
Pioneer said that it made ADollars 73.6m (USDollars 52.9m) in the period,
compared with ADollars 63.9m previously, on sales of ADollars 2.84bn,
against ADollars 2.65bn.
Operating profits were little changed overall, at ADollars 159.4m compared
with ADollars 156.5m a year earlier.
However, this conceals a sharp improvement in the building materials and
products business, where earnings before tax and interest rose by 45 per
cent, to ADollars 120m.
Major contributions came from Australian interests, at ADollars 67.5m up 44
per cent, Europe, also up 44 per cent to ADollars 34.5m, and the US, rising
103 per cent to ADollars 22.1m. The Asian operations, by contrast,
registered a loss of ADollars 4.1m, largely due to a fall in concrete prices
in Hong Kong.
The pre-interest contribution from Ampol, the company's petroleum products
subsidiary, fell 27 per cent to ADollars 63.7m. Pioneer blamed a stock loss
of ADollars 13.2m, resulting from falling crude oil prices. Excluding the
stock loss, profits would have fallen by around 12.4 per cent, on a 6.4 per
cent sales increase.
Looking ahead, Pioneer said that it expected that the full-year contribution
from the building materials side would be satisfactory, with a growing
contribution from its Asian and Eastern Europe operations over the next 12
to 18 months.
But it warned that the petroleum activities 'remain extremely difficult with
continued discounting in the retail petroleum market and a further
deterioration in the international refiner margins over the past two
months'.

in Hungarian power

<TEXT>
The Hungarian authorities yesterday cleared the way for foreign groups to
acquire up to 100 per cent of the country's regional power distribution and
conventional power stations in eastern Europe's first electricity
privatisation.
The five regional electricity companies (RECs) are capitalised at Ft240bn
(Dollars 2.4bn) and non-nuclear power generators have a nominal worth of a
further Ft154bn, making this potentially the biggest privatisation so far in
the region.
Interest in the RECs is expected primarily from Electricite de France,
Germany's Bayernwerk and other west European utilities which made offers in
an unsuccessful tender last year when just 15 per cent stakes in the
Hungarian distributors were offered.
AV RT, the state holding company, advised by London-based J. Henry Schroder
Wagg, said it had decided to structure the industry on the UK model,
separating distribution, transmission and generation. Mr Lajos Csepi, AV RT
chief executive, said it hoped to issue the first tenders for sale in April
or May with a view to completion in the autumn.
The holding company said it planned to maintain 50 per cent ownership of the
industry, based on nominal capital structure. The government would control
some nuclear power stations.
Although foreign investors would have the right to take full control, it
cautioned that it was more likely that they would take 'significant' stakes
with the promise of management control. A 'significant stake' is understood
to be at least 30 per cent.
Other tranches would be reserved for employees, partial stock market
flotations and a preferential, government scheme for smaller investors.
The Dollars 875m privatisation of Matav, the Hungarian telecoms company,
followed this pattern.

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand-based forestry, energy and construction
company, yesterday reported sharply higher group profits for the six months
to end-December as a substantial restructuring led to exceptional gains in
revenue.
Consolidated group pre-tax profits rose to NZDollars 442m (USDollars 255m)
from NZDollars 76.5m in the same period last year, on turnover down 13 per
cent to NZDollars 4,313m from NZDollars 4,949m. Earnings per share were rose
to 35.3 cents from 7.9 cents.
The restructuring included a series of asset sales and the partial sale of
the company's forestry division, which led to abnormal gains of NZDollars
350m.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said that in the half year the company
finalised five major sales, raising NZDollars 2.4bn, although payment for a
number of these items was not received during the period.
Fletcher Challenge floated the former stock and station agent Wrightson, and
its retail property company, St Lukes, on the New Zealand stock exchange.
Various Canadian assets were floated, and the company also sold its interest
in Fletcher Challenge Canada and completed the sale of Methanex, the world's
largest methanol maker, to Canadian interests.
But immediate prospects for cash flow and earnings were difficult,
reflecting problems in world commodity products.
Sir Ron Trotter, chairman, said half-year earnings were in line with
expectations - the success of the restructuring had been offset by
deteriorating prices in many of the group's international product markets.
He expected operating profits to be slightly higher in the second half.
Sir Ron said that the restructuring had led to an improvement in the balance
sheet, cutting the company's debt-to-equity ratio to 42.5 per cent from more
than 60 per cent 18 months ago.
The group's earnings after tax, excluding abnormals, were NZDollars 142m
compared with NZDollars 98.4m. Earnings after abnormals were NZDollars
492.1m against NZDollars 153.5m.
Sir Ron said future dividends will carry full imputation for New Zealand
residents, who will receive a tax-free dividend of 6.25 cents a share, and 3
cents for each Forestry Division share.
The restructuring has created three sets of financial results, with the
formation of two subsidiaries, Fletcher Challenge Ordinary Division and
Fletcher Challenge Forests Division, which have their shares listed in New
Zealand, New York, London, Australia and elsewhere.

Two Anglo-Dutch groups have announced plans for joint ventures in India.
Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil concern, is returning after an
absence of 17 years with a joint venture for the production and marketing of
lubricant oils.
Shell, which left India in response to Mrs Indira Gandhi, the former prime
minister's autarchic economic policies, is taking a 51 per cent stake in a
Rs1.3bn (Dollars 41m) venture with Bharat Petroleum, the Indian state-owned
oil company.
Shell brand products went on sale yesterday at 250 garages in northern and
western India. The company hopes to expand across the country and estimates
the Indian market for lubricant oils to be worth Rs40bn a year.
Other international oil groups which have taken advantage of the
government's economic liberalisation to re-establish themselves in India
include Mobil and Pennzoil, the US groups.
Hindustan Lever, the Indian subsidiary of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group, yesterday announced a 50-50 joint venture with
Kimberly-Clark of the US, to manufacture personal care products in India.
Kimberly-Clark Lever the new company, will invest Dollars 10m in a plant in
the state of Maharashtra to manufacture disposable nappies and feminine care
products. The plant will employ 100 people and go into production in 1996.
Hindustan Lever said the company would use its Indian sales force to market
the new products, with Kimberly-Clark contributing its brand-name and
technological expertise.
India's burgeoning middle classes provide an untapped market for personal
products, which are still considered luxury items, and not the necessities
they are in the West. The opening up of the economy has widened the market,
giving Indian consumers a choice for the first time in 40 years.

QBE Insurance Group, the Australian general insurer, yesterday reported net
profits of ADollars 32m (USDollars 44m) before unrealised investment gains
in the six months to end-December, up from ADollars 26.5m in the
year-earlier period. Adding in the unrealised investment gains of ADollars
76.9m, compared with a loss of ADollars 17.2m last time, group profits
surged to ADollars 108.8m from ADollars 9.25m. Gross earned premiums in the
period were ADollars 599.9m, compared with ADollars 469m a year ago.
QBE said that the profits increase resulted from improved claims ratios in
all its divisions, and better expense ratios in the reinsurance and
international primary insurance sectors. The investment gains followed a
sharp rise in the value of the company's equity portfolio.
QBE's directors have a preferred method of accounting for unrealised
investment gains, which involves spreading these over seven years. While
acknowledging this does not comply with local accounting standards, they
yesterday published figures using this alternative approach. These showed
net profits, after the smoothed investment gains, of ADollars 40.1m compared
with ADollars 30.2m last year.

The Spanish government yesterday ruled out taking a shareholding in Santana
Motor, following a threat by the company's Japanese parent, Suzuki, to close
its main Spanish factory unless it received financial support.
The industry ministry said state investment in Santana, which filed for
receivership at the weekend, was out of the question. A spokesman said such
a move would prompt a rush of similar requests. 'The queue would never end,'
he added.
The government position echoes the stand it took last year when Volkswagen,
of Germany, asked for public money to shore up its Spanish offshoot Seat,
now in the throes of a drastic restructuring.
The ministry, which began talks with management on Monday, said it had
received no official word about the company's intention to close the
four-wheel-drive vehicle plant at Linares in southern Spain, which employs
2,400.
Santana, 82 per cent owned by Suzuki, told employee representatives and
unions it would be 'very difficult' to keep the main manufacturing
activities.
Santana said it had accumulated losses of Pta21bn (Dollars 149m) in the last
three years. Unless 'third parties' met its financial requirements it would
be obliged 'to take the measures that the law permits under such
circumstances'.

Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian
newspaper group, yesterday reported after-tax profits of ADollars 16.3m
(USDollars 11.7m) in the year to end-December, up from ADollars 12.4m in the
previous 12 months. Revenues increased from ADollars 143.3m to ADollars
134.3m.
Mr O'Reilly, chief executive of US food group Heinz, is chairman of the
Dublin-based Independent Newspapers of Ireland, which this week moved to
raise its stake in Newspaper Publishing to nearly 30 per cent. Newspaper
Publishing owns Britain's Independent and Independent on Sunday titles.
In part, the improvement in Australia was due to lower finance charges.
Interest paid and borrowing costs were ADollars 6.32m, compared with just
over ADollars 12m the previous year, although interest received also dipped
from ADollars 1.06m to ADollars 496,000. 'APN did not float until May 1992,
and consequently the group had a substantially higher average debt level in
the first half of 1992,' said the company.
However, operating earnings before interest also rose, from ADollars 31.2m
to ADollars 34m. During the year, APN acquired the Peter Isaacson publishing
house in Melbourne, and expanded its titles. The company, whose regional
publications are principally in Queensland and New South Wales, described
the performance as 'creditable'.

Contracts related to three large capital projects and exports to China
helped Murray &amp; Roberts (M&amp;R), the South African engineering and
construction group, offset difficult local trading conditions in the
half-year to December 1993. Pre-tax profit edged forward to R180m (Dollars
51m) from R178m in 1992.
Sales climbed 13 per cent to R3.7bn, as the group's engineering and
materials divisions picked up work on the Alusaf smelter expansion, Columbus
Stainless Steel expansion and Nawakwa Sands projects. Mr Andre van der
Colff, chief executive, said M&amp;R would reap the full benefit of its
involvement in the projects by the year-end.
He said the group continued to export successfully, supplying engine blocks
to Volkswagen South Africa for a R900m order from China, valves for a Hong
Kong/China water pipeline, and seatbelts for a US motor manufacturer.
M&amp;R's exposure to reconstruction spending has made its shares popular among
foreign investors buying South African equities. The shares closed unchanged
at R84.75 yesterday, near their R86 high 10 days ago.
Income before interest and depreciation charges rose to R377m from R340m,
before higher interest payments of R60m against R43m. A lower tax bill
flattered after-tax income, but distributable profit slid to R107m from
R111m. Earnings fell 3 per cent to 171 cents from 177 cents a share.
Mr van der Colff said despite falling operating margins, tight cost controls
were improving the group's cash generation - operating cash flow per share
rose to 363 cents from 255 cents - which lay behind the decision to increase
the interim dividend by 2 cents to 58 cents. It would be an 'exceptional'
achievement, given South Africa's unsettled political and economic climate,
for the group to claw back the earnings decline by the year-end.

<TEXT>
Dyno Industrier, the big Norwegian explosives and chemicals producer,
yesterday reported 1993 pre-tax profits almost doubled as sales advanced 10
per cent, helped by acquisitions, stronger chemicals operations and firmer
south-east Asian markets.
Nevertheless, the board proposed to leave the 1993 dividend unchanged at
NKr2 a share.
Group pre-tax profit rose to NKr307m (Dollars 41m) from NKr161m, as sales
increased by NKr745m to NKr8.23bn. Operating profit rose to NKr414m from
NKr329m.
Operating expenses increased by NKr612m to NKr7.3bn, as depreciation rose by
NKr48m to NKr514m.
Mr Arild Ingierd, president, said the result was acceptable but not
satisfactory, and noted that the plastics division is operating at a loss
due to high investment costs for equipment needed to escalate deliveries of
plastic fuel tanks.
Gains of NKr55m on securities in 1993 were achieved, against losses of
NKr32m in 1992.
Dyno said that about 85 per cent of its operations are now based outside
Norway. It anticipates continued growth in south-east Asia, but North
American and European markets still suffer from excess capacity and tougher
competition.

Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI), Portugal's leading investment bank,
registered a 42 per cent drop in consolidated net profits last year,
compared with 1992, to Es8.1bn (Dollars 46m).
Mr Artur Santos Silva, BPI president, attributed the fall in profits to a 29
per cent reduction in the margin between loans and deposits, and a
substantial increase in provisions from Es3.8bn in 1992 to Es8.3bn last
year.
BPI, which wholly owns the privatised retail bank Banco Fonsecas e Burnay,
partly compensated for a slow 3 per cent growth in consolidated credit with
a 22 per cent rise in commission-based earnings and a 59 per cent increase
in profits from financial operations, mainly government debt security
trading.
Secil, a Portuguese cement producer due for privatisation later this year,
has announced a 5.5 per cent increase in profits in 1993 to Es4bn. Sales
remained virtually unchanged at Es22bn.

SKF, the largest maker of ball and roller bearings, signalled it had turned
the corner to better times yesterday when it announced its first quarterly
operating profit for two years and sharply reduced losses for 1993.
The group made a SKr40m (Dollars 5.04m) profit after financial items in the
last three months of the year, reversing a SKr1.42bn deficit in the same
1992 period. This reduced losses for the full-year to SKr669m, compared with
SKr1.77bn in 1992.
The group predicted a profit for 1994, helped by improving market conditions
and the benefits of cost-cutting. It noted that the European market, which
accounts for 60 per cent of sales, was picking up, even though the German
and French markets remain weak.
The weaker krona enabled the group to raise 1993 sales by 10 per cent to
SKr29.2m from SKr26.6m. Adjusted for disposals and currency factors, sales
fell 4 per cent because increased demand for the group's products in North
America and the Asia Pacific region was unable to offset weak trends in
Europe.
The group was badly hit by the downturn in Europe's car industry, its most
important customer segment, although it noted that its own sales fell less
than the overall 15 per cent decline in car sales.
At the operating level, profits amounted to SKr97m, compared with a
SKr1.18bn loss in 1992. However, financial expenses increased to SKr766m
from SKr592m as the weak krona increased the cost of financing foreign
currency loans.
The group's main bearings and seals unit cut losses sharply to SKr329m from
SKr1.26bn as sales rose to SKr27.2bn from SKr22.7bn. There was also a
reduced deficit at Ovako Steel, where losses fell to SKr351m from SKr442m
despite a 6 per cent drop in sales to SKr2.89bn.
The loss per share before extraordinary items was SKr5.70, compared with
SKr13.20 in 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, is raising DM700m
(Dollars 397.7m) through a deeply discounted one-for-eight rights issue. The
group said funds from the issue would bolster its financial position.
While announcing the issue, Munich Re predicted losses from mainstream
reinsurance business - before investment income - in the financial year to
June would be reduced. Although there had been abundant natural disasters in
1993, the knock-on effect on the reinsurance industry had been less severe
than in previous years, the group explained.
Growth in premium income during the financial year to June 1994 would be in
the region of 10 per cent, the same as in the past two years. It said it was
too early to judge the precise level of overall profitability for the group
but was confident that investment income would again compensate for
underwriting losses.
This would enable last year's dividend of DM11 per share to be matched,
Munich Re said. Last year underwriting losses rose to DM1.27bn from DM1.12bn
but after investment income, net earnings climbed to DM287m from DM278m.
Premium income rose to DM25.56bn from DM23bn.
The new shares are priced at DM800, a discount of about 75 per cent. The
shares closed down DM20 at DM3,020 yesterday.
Each new share comes with a warrant attached and four of these will allow
the shareholder to subscribe for one further Munich Re share at an exercise
price of DM2,650. The warrants may be exercised between July 4 this year and
March 13 1998.

Olivetti
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the Olivetti computers and office equipment group rose sharply
against the trend yesterday as investors reacted to its improved prospects
of running Italy's second mobile communications network.
Olivetti stock jumped L55 to close at L2,359 following this week's news that
Pronto Italia, one of the three bidders for the cellular licence, was
joining forces with the Olivetti-led Omnitel consortium.
The move by Pronto Italia, an alliance of Germany's Mannesmann and Pacific
Telesis of the US with a group of Italian banks and medium-sized companies,
reduces the contest to a two-horse race.
The other contestant is Unitel, a consortium combining Fiat, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire and Vodafone of the UK. In January,
Etra, the fourth serious bidder, dominated by subsidiaries of the
state-controlled Eni energy and chemicals concern, joined forces with
Unitel.
Pronto Italia's decision has been seen as a big boost for Omnitel, which has
been pushing strongly for the licence. Italy is now Europe's third biggest
cellular communications market after the UK and Germany, with about 1.2m
subscribers
Demand might have increased even faster had Italy's anti-monopoly
authorities not stopped the state-controlled Sip telephones utility from
soliciting new subscribers. Sip monopolises the existing analogue network
and had started experimental services with a system based on the new
Europe-wide GSM digital network standard when it was told not to solicit for
GSM business.
The ban followed a European Union ruling demanding an end to state
monopolies in mobile communications and the introduction of private sector
competition. After some delays, the decision to break Sip's monopoly is now
moving ahead in earnest.
The latest jockeying for position among the contestants comes ahead of a
March 1 deadline for final proposals. Bids will then be put to the team of
consultants and bankers commissioned by Italy's posts ministry to assess the
plans. A winner is expected to be named by the end of April.
That deadline is by no means certain, however. Should a choice not be made
in time, the prospect of a new government after the March 27 general
election could tempt the existing government, which will stay on as
caretaker until a new administration is sworn in, to put off a decision.
Postponement has its merits; choosing a winner is a political minefield
given the prestige and political clout of the companies involved.
Mr Maurizio Pagani, the post minister, indicated earlier this month that a
choice could come before the end of April if ministry specialists found that
one bid was patently superior to the others. A finely-matched contest, on
the other hand, would make the decision that much harder, he implied
Analysts are unable to pinpoint a clear front runner on either technological
or financial grounds. Although each of the consortia has tried to
distinguish itself from its rivals, all have stressed their avant-garde
technology, experience, financial muscle and marketing and distribution
skills.
However, this week's apparent boost to Omnitel does not leave Unitel
entirely down and out. Within minutes of the news, it responded by
announcing a deal with IBM's Italy-based regional headquarters to develop
and use special IBM software for its new network. Although IBM is not taking
a stake, the association of such a prestigious name with Unitel was seen as
a speedy attempt at limit the damage of the surprise Pronto Italia-Omnitel
alliance.

AssiDoman, a newly formed state-owned Swedish forestry group due to be
partly privatised next month, yesterday reported a 1993 profit after
financial items of SKr983m (Dollars 124m), more than two times the 1992
result of SKr310m.
The government is aiming to raise up to SKr9bn through an offering of 49 per
cent of the company. AssiDoman, formed at the start of this year from the
two companies Assi and Doman, is the fourth-largest Swedish forestry group
and one of Europe's top 10.
It intends to bid for another 51 per cent state-owned Swedish forestry
group, Ncb, following completion of the partial privatisation. Analysts said
the result was ahead of previous expectations of a profit after financial
items of about SKr700m. Turnover of SKr12.4bn was 9 per cent ahead of the
1992 figure of SKr11.4bn.
AssiDoman included an extraordinary charge of SKr791m, to leave a pre-tax
profit of SKr192m, compared with a loss of SKr141m in 1992.

Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth largest bank, is planning to pay a dividend of
DKr8 per share for 1993 after reporting a net profit of DKr443m (Dollars
65.73m) compared with a 1992 loss of DKr913m. No dividend was paid for 1992.
Financial income increased strongly to DKr2.95bn from DKr1.82bn, boosted by
last year's increase in the value of bonds and shares.
Costs were stable at DKr1.46bn, while bad loss provisions were cut to
DKr844m from DKr1.26bn. Operating profit, before extraordinary costs of
DKr131m, was DKr584m, a return of 15.6 per cent on equity, against a 1992
loss of DKr916m.
The bank broke new ground for disclosure by Danish banks by publishing the
accumulated sum of its provisions. This amounted to DKr1.7bn, or 4.56 per
cent of loans and guarantees, while non-performing credits were DKr1.53bn,
or 4.10 per cent of loans and guarantees.
The balance sheet total was DKr56bn at the end of last year and capital
adequacy ratio 10.9 per cent, including an 8.1 per cent tier 1 ratio.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Corp hit by Y80bn
provision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan's largest trading group, yesterday cut its
profits forecast for the current year, saying that a restructuring announced
last year would cost much more than had been expected. The recession in
Japan has also affected trading
The group, the core of the diversified Mitsubishi group, warned that it
expected net income to fall to a mere Y3bn (Dollars 28m) for the year to
March, from Y15.3bn in 1993. It had been forecasting only a small decline in
net income to Y15bn this year, its third annual profit decline.
The main reason is the Y80bn Mitsubishi provision plans to make for selling
or closing unprofitable businesses, in a review launched late last year of
its 600 subsidiaries and affiliates. This compares with Y66bn of provisions
in the year to March 1993, and will enable the group to start this year with
a clean balance sheet, Mitsubishi said.
Mitsubishi Corporation, which embraces oil and fuels, heavy industrial
goods, metals, textiles and goods among other sectors, is one of several of
Japan's keiretsus, or families of companies linked by equity cross-holdings,
to have been forced to reassess their alliances in the light of the
recession.
The Mitsubishi move was prompted by the poor performance of some of the
several hundred businesses it acquired or invested in during the economic
upturn of the late 1980s. Those investments were themselves the consequence
of a previous strategic rethink, in 1986, when the group responded to the
coming upturn of the time by expanding its activities.
Capital gains on the sale of securities will cover some of the restructuring
charges, said Mitsubishi. It expects turnover to be unchanged at Y14,000bn
and plans to maintain the annual dividend at Y8 per share.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: SMH advance slows to 7% as sales
remain flat

<TEXT>
SMH, the leading Swiss watchmaking group forming a joint venture with
Mercedes-Benz of Germany to build an environmentally friendly city car, has
reported 1993 net income of SFr440m (Dollars 297.2m), up 7 per cent on 1992.
The rise was much smaller than in 1991 and 1992 when the group, known best
for its Swatch watches, recorded rises of 32 per cent and 64 per cent
respectively. Sales last year were flat at SFr2.86bn.
The group described the results as 'favourable' and said they were achieved
in spite of currency losses and largely unchanged end-user prices in soft
currency countries.
The directors propose to increase dividends from 18 per cent of par value to
20 per cent.
Shares in SMH, which revived the Swiss watch industry in the early 1980s,
have been highly volatile recently as investors worried that the growth
potential of the watch business and other ventures, such as Swatch
telephones, was fading.
Also, the withdrawal in December of Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss
financier, from the group that holds the controlling shareholding in SMH,
unnerved investors.
For a long time, there has also been uncertainty about the so-called
'Swatchmobile' project. Mr Nicolas Hayek, SMH chairman, had long talked
about launching a revolutionary small, environmentally friendly car that SMH
had developed. Prior to reviving SMH, he spent most of his time as an
independent consultant to the automotive industry.
He saw the car as an 'emotional product,' much like a watch, and felt that
his experiences of both the car and watch industries qualified him to make
it a success. However, an attempt to form an alliance with Volkswagen to
build the car collapsed last year.
Mr Hayek has kept details of the project secret, but according to various
reports, the Swatchmobile will be 2.8 metres long and have an aluminium body
and a hybrid petrol and electric engine.
News of the venture with Mercedes has pushed up SMH shares. In the past two
sessions, the bearer shares have gained 8 per cent to SFr1,004.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fidelity Japanese placing raises Pounds 86m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidelity Japanese Values has raised Pounds 86m during its placing stage. The
public offer, which closes on March 8, could bring the fund up to a total
Pounds 150m.
Ordinary shares in the investment trust are being offered at 100p, with one
warrant attached for every five shares. Dealings are expected to start on
March 15.
Strong institutional demand for the fund illustrates the findings of recent
surveys, which have shown that UK fund managers are increasing their
weightings in Japan. Fidelity argues that smaller and medium-sized
companies, in which the fund will specialise, will be best placed to benefit
from any recovery, as well as from deregulation and other changes in the
economy.
Fidelity is better known for its unit trusts, this being only its second UK
investment trust. The group already has a Japanese Smaller Companies unit
trust, run by the same fund management team which will manage Japanese
Values. It is the seventh best performing Japanese unit trust over five
years, but ranks 35 out of 74 in the sector over three years.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: James Smith Estates raising Pounds 12.3m to
fund acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Smith Estates, the Sussex-based property investment company, is
raising a net Pounds 12.3m through a placing and open offer. It is also
intending to move up from the USM to the Official List.
The proceeds will be used to fund acquisitions, including Pounds 8m for
three recent commercial property purchases in Sussex and Hampshire.
The company is also having talks on other purchases with a total value in
excess of the balance of the funds raised.
The company said that it intended to raise additional finance through the
issue of long-term fixed interest debt.
Some 10.3m shares have been conditionally placed at 125p and are being
offered to shareholders on a 2-for-3 basis. The shares closed unchanged at
133p.
The offer is sponsored by Close Brothers; brokers are de Zoete &amp; Bevan.
On the present year the company said it was trading satisfactorily with
gross rental income from property investment held at March 25 1993 running
at similar levels to a year earlier. Since March 24 the open market
valuation of the investment property portfolio had increased by Pounds 2.57m
to Pounds 26.6m.
Directors said without unforeseen circumstances they intended to recommend a
final dividend of 3.1p for an increased total of 4.65p (4.2p).

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Irish Permanent plans listing -
Market capitalisation of about IPounds 200m expected in summer float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Permanent Building Society, the largest building society in the
Republic of Ireland, is to seek a flotation on the London and Dublin stock
exchanges in the early summer.
The IPBS has 30 per cent of the Irish residential mortgage market, assets of
IPounds 2.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn) and reserves of IPounds 156.2m.
Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive, said the conversion of IPBS from its mutual
status to a plc was 'a strategic issue, to obtain access to the equity
market on an ongoing basis.'
The company simultaneously reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to IPounds 29m (IPounds 21.5m) for the year to December 31.
Net interest income grew by 33 per cent to IPounds 80.4m, while the
cost/income ratio was reduced to 60.5 per cent (64.3 per cent). A target
ratio of 50 per cent has been set for 1996.
IPBS is the first building society in the Republic to seek conversion, and
the move marks a major development in Ireland's financial services industry.
Market liberalisation in recent years has permitted banks and building
societies to broaden their range of services, such that the distinction
between them is becoming increasingly blurred.
The resulting intensification of competition has placed building societies
at a relative disadvantage to publicly-quoted banks, as their mutual status
limits them to raising capital largely from retained profits.
Members'approval for conversion of the society's mutual status to a plc and
flotation will be sought at the annual meeting in four weeks' time.
Conversion will result in the issue of 81m free shares to an estimated
227,000 qualifying members of and a cash distribution of up to IPounds 200
each for a further 100,000 members who do not qualify for the free shares.
The flotation, in June 'or soon thereafter,' will raise up to IPounds 50m in
new capital with the issue of a further 36m shares.
Mr Douglas said the flotation shares would be placed with institutions and
offered through subscription rights, rather than an open offer.
He added that on completion of the flotation, market capitalisation was
expected to be between IPounds 180m and IPounds 200m, giving an indicative
share price of 150p to 166p.
Growth strategy would focus on the personal savings and lending segment of
the Irish market, and the development of a life assurance business.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: ACT reorganises to focus on financial
software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT, the computing services company, has embarked on a programme of
restructuring and disposals which will leave it, possibly by the end of this
year, as a tightly-focused financial software concern.
The company at present comprises two divisions. Financial software products
generate Pounds 150m of group annual sales totalling Pounds 250m but account
for 80 per cent of profits. Information systems covers a diverse group of
companies, including computer maintenance and hospital management systems.
The company has already disposed of Cablestream to Siemens of Germany for
Pounds 5m and Brann Marketing to its management for Pounds 8m.
On the basis of restructuring announcements made earlier this week it is
expected that other non-core activities will be sold soon. These could
include Network Si, a computer networking subsidiary, Computer Support,
which provides maintenance and outsourcing services, Medisys, which
specialises in the healthcare market and Logsys, an open systems supplier to
central and local government.
ACT intends to integrate its three financial software subsidiaries - Kindle,
BIS Banking Systems and ACT Financial Systems - under a central operating
board. The board will comprise Mr Roger Foster, ACT founder and chairman, Mr
Mike Hart, group managing director, and Mr Brian Whitty, finance director,
together with managing directors of the three subsidiaries, Mr Kieran Nagle,
Mr Paul Newton and Mr Eurfyl ap Gwilym.
Kindle, based in Dublin, will be renamed ACT Banking Systems and be
responsible for marketing banking products to emerging financial centres in
eastern Europe and the Middle East.
BIS Banking Systems will be renamed ACT International and will be
responsible for marketing in established financial centres. ACT Financial
Systems will be responsible for marketing in the UK.
Mr Foster said the strategy was designed to give the company a single
corporate identity in the financial world, eliminating duplication in
offices, marketing, products and research and development.
'The game plan is to establish a global presence in a single niche market,
financial services. If you are a UK company without a global presence you
will be squeezed by bigger companies.'
ACT, with 3,500 staff, is one of the UK's largest computer services groups.
Founded as a computer bureau, it moved into personal computers before
selling its hardware division to Mitsubishi Electric of Japan four years
ago.
It has since made a series of acquisitions, chiefly in the financial
services areas, including Quotient and NMW, the stock processors and Kindle
and BIS Banking Systems, which supply banking packages.
BIS cost Pounds 93.5m, financed partly through a rights issue. ACT now has
no debt and no cash. The disposals will raise substantial sums, which it is
thought will be used partly to buy small companies providing financial
software which fill gaps in its packaged software product line.
Analysts broadly welcomed the new strategy. Ms Sue Cox of Warburg said it
was a logical progression. The company's chief problem had been credibility
with such a broad spread of activities.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dale Electric blames deficit on provisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dale Electric International, the maker of power systems, tumbled from
pre-tax profits of Pounds 544,000 to losses of Pounds 933,000 in the half
year to October 31.
Mr Iain Dale, chairman, said that the warning issued in October estimating a
Pounds 700,000 first half loss was an 'impressionistic forecast' of the
deterioration in trading conditions. He said that the loss related to
provisions against contracts.
Although the aviation sector remained depressed, he said the group was
already benefiting from increased worldwide investment in airport
infrastructure. Measures to achieve annualised cost savings of Pounds 1.1m
had been implemented.
Mr Dale added that the order book at January 31 was ahead 62 per cent at
Pounds 26m (Pounds 16m).
Turnover from continuing activities fell to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 26.7m).
Losses per share were 6.74p (3.02p earnings). The interim dividend is halved
to 1p.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Algerian oil and gas find for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, has made its
third oil and gas discovery in eastern Algeria.
The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US - Lasmo's partner in the
venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at a cumulative rate of
8,100 barrels of oil and condensate and 82.5m cu ft of gas a day.
It is the third discovery from four exploration wells which Anadarko has
drilled in the area. Two additional prospects in the area will be drilled
soon, according to Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer.
The desert areas being explored have so far been free from any of the
political violence affecting Algeria. But drilling crews and technical staff
are flown directly to the area, thus avoiding the capital, Algiers.
Further drilling to appraise the full potential of the discoveries is likely
to take place later this year, the company said. It is also assessing the
overall potential of Algeria in light of the string of discoveries.
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, an independent exploration and production
company, has found gas in a new field to the west of the large Qadripur gas
field in Pakistan.
The discovery in the Ghauspur block was in geology similar to that of
Qadripur. But the different composition of the gas confirmed it was a
separate field, the company said.
Gas from the latest find has a relatively low calorific value and a high
nitrogen content, but the company believes it could be marketable if the
reserve proves large enough.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hopes for a turnround in injury time -
Wembley has five weeks to attempt to pacify lenders and investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's self-proclaimed 'Venue of Legends' has moved into financial injury
time.
Wembley, owner of the north London sports and exhibition complex, has
exactly five weeks in which to complete a radical disposal programme that
threatens to kill off its position as a diversified entertainment and
leisure group.
Since mid-1992 it has sold off assets worth more than Pounds 37m, but still
failed to pacify lenders owed Pounds 139m and investors who have seen the
share price tumble from a 1987 high of 157p to 16p.
Profits have not fared any better. In spite of steadily rising turnover, the
group reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12m in 1992 on sales 13 per cent
ahead at Pounds 191.4m, and only moved into profit last year following asset
sales.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, is candid about where the group went wrong.
'For six years, we spent Pounds 1m a month on Wembley and we thought we
could spin out businesses from the stadium. We did that using cash, and then
we hit the recession at 100 miles an hour with a weak balance sheet.'
Confronted with a debt mountain and operating profits dependent on bookings
for pop concerts and a few full-house soccer matches, the banks told him to
start selling assets.
As he prepares to sign away the next tranche of subsidiaries in the US,
analysts in London are predicting that Sir Brian will be left with a company
still valued at more than Pounds 45m but with few assets to speak of.
Once the disposal programme is complete, all that will remain is the north
London exhibition arena, conference hall and stadium, plus a few greyhound
tracks and a hospitality furniture business.
Although Sir Brian is confident that there is scope there to generate fresh
operating profits, analysts are expecting 1993 annual losses of at least
Pounds 1.5m and, at best, a Pounds 500,000 gain in 1994.
'They are going to have start motoring a bit to see any earnings growth.
Even if pre-tax profits reached Pounds 3m, earnings per share would be no
more than half a penny,' according to one analyst.
The balance sheet, meanwhile, could be further depleted as the disposal
programme feeds through.
The group's operating properties were valued at Pounds 286.2m in December
1990. But assets sales are now expected to lead to large write-downs on
fixed assets, which the group put at Pounds 353m at the end of 1992.
A shadow, meanwhile, has been cast over future income by a dispute with the
Football Association, which now wants a share of the perimeter advertising
revenue which Wembley earns from soccer matches.
In a piece of brinkmanship, Mr Trevor Phillips, the FA's commercial
director, threatened to move England fixtures and the FA Cup Final elsewhere
if he could not extract a better deal.
Wembley knows such a move is unlikely, but the threat has unsettled its
investors. Worse still, it has failed to secure pop concert bookings this
year - a main revenue earner.
Acknowledging the importance of such concerts, Mr Bob Heaver, a Wembley
director, says: 'Only about half our revenue comes from football; the FA Cup
Final is probably the biggest earner, but Madonna can run it close.'
Nevertheless, he is optimistic that the stadium can lead the company back to
financial health. Standing in one of the executive suites in the 80,000-seat
arena, he says the company has drawn up plans for a large-scale
refurbishment.
Chartered surveyors, architects and engineers have been consulted to see if
another tier of seats could be added, an athletics track installed, the
internal pillars removed, and, most ambitiously, it is investigating roofing
over the pitch.
'Once the technological problems with maintaining the turf are sorted out, a
roof over the complex could go up in 18 months,' he says.
Analysts, however, say Wembley's performance since its last right issue,
which raised Pounds 37.3m in 1992, could make it difficult to attract fresh
capital for these schemes.
'There is some uncertainty whether they could ask investors for more cash,
especially given the concentration of offshore shareholders,' said one
analyst.
His concern centres on the interests of Rolaco Holdings, a Switzerland-based
company with stakes in Club Mediterranee and the Kempinski hotel group.
Rolaco is the investor group behind Orpington Investments, which holds an
11.25 per cent stake.
Mr Heaver dismisses such concerns. He says the company can rely on
shareholders controlling at least 16 per cent to push through its plans.
Those plans involve turning Wembley into the fulcrum of a stadium management
business. To that end, it has set up Wembley International, a new division
which has already won a 10-year contract to run the new HKDollars 80m
(Pounds 7m) Hong Kong Stadium and acted as consultants for new arenas in
South Africa and east Asia.
'These stadiums are all multi-purpose venues and that's what we're
developing at Wembley,' says Mr Heaver.
'We know there's a lot of work to be done, but the game's not over by a long
way.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wembley's asset sales expected soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wembley, the greyhound track operator and owner of the famous London
stadium, is expected to sell two of its largest assets this week to comply
with a banking deadline to cut borrowings by Pounds 40m, writes Tim Burt.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, is understood to be completing negotiations in
the US to dispose of the Lincoln Greyhound track in Rhode Island and Pacer
Cats, the computer ticketing company.
The sale of Pacer Cats, which produces and services ticket computer systems
in North America and Europe, is expected to raise about Pounds 20m, taking
the disposal programme within 5 per cent of the total repayments due by
March 31.
Although the moves will significantly reduce Wembley's net debt - put at
Pounds 139m at the interim stage last year - lenders, led by Barclays, have
also demanded repayment of a further Pounds 10m by the end of the year.
Concerned at gearing levels, which touched almost 80 per cent last year, the
banks are expected to force more disposals.
Industry analysts yesterday predicted that the group would have to sell some
of its remaining greyhound tracks in Britain and the US.
'There are more disposals to come. Even if Wembley meets the bank deadlines
they will still be quite highly geared,' said one analyst.
Speaking from the US, Sir Brian admitted: 'The group is just treading water.
Until we finish the disposals programme we cannot embrace new business
plans.'
Those plans centre on developing its arena management business and signing
new advertising contracts for its flagship asset, Wembley stadium.
Moves to sign new advertising deals have, however, prompted a row with the
Football Association, which has a 20-year contract with Wembley to stage all
of its major domestic soccer fixtures and international matches at the north
London site.
Under the contract, signed in 1982, Wembley receives between 25 and 32 per
cent of ticket sales and 25 per cent of television revenue, but retains
complete control of perimeter advertising.
The FA, which wants to renegotiate the agreement, has been angered by a deal
signed by Wembley last month with Sports and Outdoor Media, the
international advertising agency which already handles the Melbourne Cricket
Ground and Lord's.
Mr Tim Crow, sales director at the agency, said it hoped to sign advertising
agreements with 10 international corporations, which would be designated
'official sponsors' for all events at Wembley.
'In perimeter advertising, nothing like this has yet been achieved in the
UK. We're not selling soccer, we're selling Wembley stadium,' he said.
The FA, which is in arbitration with Wembley, is understood to regard the
scheme as a threat to its own plans to win new sponsors for English
football.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic rises to Pounds 67m aided by
insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TransAtlantic Holdings, the property and life assurance group controlled by
Mr Donald Gordon, the South African financier, yesterday reported a 19 per
cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 56.5m to Pounds 67m.
The results were ahead of market expectations, primarily due to 50 per
cent-owned associate Sun Life, which 'showed exceptionally strong growth',
according to Mr Gordon, TransAtlantic's chairman.
Earnings rose by 59 per cent to 13.24p (8.35p), reflecting mainly a fall in
tax to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 19.2m) thanks to scrip dividends which saved
ACT. A final dividend of 6p is announced, representing an unchanged
full-year pay-out of 12p.
Sun Life's contribution increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 42.7m. UAP,
France's largest insurer, owns the other 50 per cent of the life insurer.
New annual regular premiums increased by 25 per cent to Pounds 106.7m and
single premiums increased by 60 per cent to Pounds 2.24bn. Sun Life reported
pre-tax profit of Pounds 59.3m, up from Pounds 51.3m.
TransAtlantic's property interests, incorporating the Capital &amp; Counties,
contributed increased operating profit before administrative expenses of
Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 71.4m).
TransAtlantic is finalising the flotation of its shopping centre interests
into a separately listed company, Capital Shopping Centres, which should
have an initial market capitalisation of about Pounds 600m.
The remaining property portfolio is also valued at Pounds 600m, and Mr
Gordon said the company planned to increase its non-retail property
activities.
TransAtlantic yesterday finalised a Pounds 250m convertible bond issue,
which will fund the recent Pounds 162m purchase of Sun Alliance's share of
the Harlequin shopping centre in Watford, and reduce its floating rate debt
to Pounds 58m.
Mr Gordon said the company was interested in establishing a new leg to its
business by investing in a life assurance company in North America. There
were numerous opportunities. 'If you come out with a cheque for Dollars 1bn,
you can do a lot of things in the US,' he said. TransAtlantic also owns 3
per cent of Sun Alliance.
TransAtlantic's net asset value per share rose by 6 per cent to 298p in
1993, but the company said that the current book valuation of Sun Life
'materially understates TransAtlantic's net asset value.'
COMMENT
TransAtlantic's results provide some justification for the recent strong
performance of the share price, demonstrating the strength of new business
growth at Sun Life, amid a competitive market. Profits should reach Pounds
75m in 1994, putting TransAtlantic shares on a p/e of 30. This is
aggressive, despite the long-term nature of its shopping centre investments.
Fair market values for property and insurance would push the net asset value
closer to the share price; but unless Donald Gordon pulls a choice
acquisition out of the hat, the shares look fairly valued.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Spurs shares dip to 82p on profits downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club now 50.1 per
cent owned by Mr Alan Sugar, its chairman, fell 10p to 82p yesterday on news
that pre-tax profits for the six months to November 30 had fallen from
Pounds 3.28m to Pounds 644,000.
However, Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said profits on continuing
operations before interest rose from Pounds 242,000 to Pounds 275,000.
Meanwhile a case brought by Tottenham for winding-up Edennote, a company
controlled by Mr Terry Venables, Spurs' ousted chief executive and team
manager, was yesterday adjourned until April, as Mr Venables plans to fight
the petition.
Mr Sandy said Tottenham had sought the winding-up over Pounds 335,000, which
was the adjudication by the taxing master of money owed from a possible
Pounds 400,000. This, plus a further Pounds 150,000 of costs over Mr
Venables' claim for wrongful dismissal as chief executive last summer were
provided for in last year's accounts.
The Football Association is still investigating the club over player
transfer dealings, but Mr Sandy said Mr Rick Parry, Premier League chief
executive, did not expect the club to be relegated.
Turnover fell to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 15.1m) as the proceeds from the
disposal of players' registrations fell to Pounds 4.54m (Pounds 8.15m). The
figure was boosted by Pounds 2.8m from the Pounds 5.5m sale of Paul
Gascoigne.
Interest payable was Pounds 86,000 (receivable Pounds 352,000, including
Pounds 450,000 from the Gascoigne sale). Earnings per share tumbled to 2.7p
(19.2p). There is no interim dividend.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson to raise Dollars 232m from sale and
Beazer US flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson is to receive Dollars 232m (Pounds 157m) from the flotation of Beazer
Homes USA, which was priced yesterday, and the sale of property in Hawaii.
The Anglo-American conglomerate will today issue the pathfinder prospectus
for the flotation of Beazer Homes in the UK which will be completed by the
group's half year end in March.
The net book value of the assets being sold was Dollars 201m at January 31.
Mr David Clarke, chief executive officer of Hanson Industries, Hanson's US
business, said the share sale 'demonstrates the premium value of Hanson's
individual business units'. Hanson shares rose 4p to 279p.
The sale of the two housebuilding activities, acquired with the purchase of
Beazer in December 1991, will help in Hanson's efforts to cut its gearing -
which stood at 86 per cent in the September 30 balance sheet. The news
followed Tuesday's Dollars 1bn convertible bond issue.
At the year end Hanson's net debt stood at Pounds 3.4bn compared to
shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.95bn. Prior to the Beazer US deal, Hanson
had raised Pounds 256m from disposals in this financial year.
The price for the US share issue was set at Dollars 17.50, in the middle of
the revised price range of Dollars 16.50 - Dollars 18.50 a share. Hanson is
selling 6m shares, cutting its stake to 33.3 per cent, but could sell a
further 900,000 if underwriters find strong demand which would cut the
holding to 25.8 per cent.
Beazer Homes USA is also issuing Dollars 115m of 10 year senior notes,
carrying a 9 per cent coupon. With the repayment of debt to Hanson and the
proceeds from the share sale, Hanson is receiving Dollars 184m.
The balance of Dollars 48m is coming from the sale of 220 acres on Ma'ili
Kai, Oahu, the stock of Lokelani Construction and houses under construction
to Schuler Homes. Hanson acquired these with its purchase of Kaiser Cement
Corp.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Four directors at Lonrho to receive Pounds
2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payments totalling more than Pounds 2.4m are being paid to four Lonrho
directors, aged between 64 and 77, who are leaving the international trading
group's board.
In a highly unusual compensation package, the company is asking shareholders
to approve payments of Pounds 772,624 each to Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert
Dunlop, both deputy chairmen, aged 64 and 66. Meanwhile, the 74-year-old
chairman Mr Rene Leclezio will receive Dollars 732,000 (Pounds 491,000) and
Pounds 120,000 in other payments. Sir Peter Youens, 77, gets Pounds 300,000.
The payments are bigger than each director's one-year contractual
entitlement because no director can be removed from the board without its
unanimous consent. In other words, a director can only be removed with his
consent.
Lonrho's accounts, published yesterday, also disclose that the group's
76-year-old founder and joint chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who has no
plans to retire, received remuneration last year totalling Pounds 1.62m
(Pounds 1.65m).
The payments to the four directors are bigger than expected because each
will remain a director of a Lonrho subsidiary until December 31, 1998. Their
remuneration for these directorships is part of their packages.
Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive with Mr Rowland, believes the payouts
are justified because it gives him control of the board. The four are
closely identified with Mr Rowland, who has resisted some of Mr Bock's plans
to transform Lonrho into a more orthodox company.
A spokesman for Mr Bock said: 'There is nothing to explain about the
payments which represent two years' salary. The four will remain directors
of a subsidiary they have been closely identified with.'
Lonrho's institutional investors have already indicated to Mr Bock that they
will support the compensation arrangements.
One of the company's biggest shareholders said: 'Lonrho is proposing to pay
out a huge amount of money to persuade old directors to step down when the
retiring age of directors at most companies is 65. However, in these
circumstances we believe it still represents good value for money.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bibby puts Pounds 75m flotation on ice
after offer from AB Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Bibby &amp; Sons has put the imminent Pounds 75m flotation of half its
business on ice while it considers an offer for its agricultural division
from Associated British Foods.
The division was one of four that was to form the new company whose
flotation was announced last October. It was a means of cutting Bibby's
debt, which stood at Pounds 122.8m at the year end following the ill-fated
Pounds 82m acquisition of Finanzauto, the Spanish distributor for
Caterpillar in July 1992.
The offer from ABF, the milling, baking and grocery products group which has
substantial cash balances, is conditional on due diligence and negotiation
on price. But Bibby hopes to be in a position to give a clear message to
shareholders about the future at its delayed annual meeting, which has now
been set for March 30.
Bibby, which is 79 per cent owned by Barlow Rand, the South African group,
also released first quarter results yesterday which showed a recovery in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 3.46m. However, operating
profits from the agricultural side fell from Pounds 731,000 to Pounds
580,000.
Analysts said the sale of the agricultural business could raise Pounds 20m,
although ABF might need to spend more on restructuring the business. They
said it would fit well with ABF's animal feeds activities which derive from
both its milling and British Sugar businesses.
ABF has made two acquisitions in the field recently, KW Agriculture and
Yorkshire Country Feeds. Mr Harry Bailey, finance director, said there was
'no grand strategy' to become a leader in the industry, but where ABF could
see a sensible addition at a price to give a good return it would make
acquisitions.
Bibby's first quarter figures showed turnover static at Pounds 210m (Pounds
209m). Earnings per share were ahead from 0.52p to 1.22p.

MAI, the broadcasting and moneybroking group headed by Lord Hollick, is
increasing its stake in Satellite Information Services, which provides a
television-based racing service to betting shops, from 7 per cent to 17.5
per cent.
The shares come from Sears, the Selfridges retailing group, which is selling
its entire 12.7 per cent stake for Pounds 9.9m.
MAI is paying Pounds 8.1m for 10.5 per cent and Racal Electronics is buying
the remainder, increasing its stake to 22.2 per cent.
MAI, which controls Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television, said the
move was a natural extension of its television interests. 'With the
proliferation of television channels there will definitely be a sports
channel at some stage, perhaps even a racing channel.'
SIS dominates the coverage of UK racing, producing between five and 12 hours
of live television a day.
SIS was formed in 1986 by the then big four book-makers, Coral, Ladbroke,
Mecca and William Hill (then owned by Sears), for which it has been a very
successful investment.
Set up with Pounds 10m of equity, SIS paid out a special divi-dend of Pounds
55m last year and is now valued at over Pounds 77m on the basis of the Sears
sale.
William Hill, now owned by Brent Walker, the heavily indebted property and
leisure group, has a 15 per cent stake worth Pounds 11.7m.
Sears, which will make a profit on disposal of about Pounds 9.8m, said the
sale was in line with its strategy of selling off its non-retail interests.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Serif makes progress with losses cut to
Pounds 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Serif, the USM-quoted specialist printing and packaging group which in
November launched a Pounds 4.9m rights issue, yesterday reported a cut in
pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 1.23m for 1993.
The company said at the time of the cash call that without the rights, its
ability to trade would depend on the support of its bankers, which might not
be forthcoming.
Serif said yesterday that the proceeds had been utilised to reduce creditors
and provide additional working capital.
Turnover totalled Pounds 18.8m, a decline of Pounds 2.6m, of which Pounds 2m
was due to the disposal of the bingo activity in 1992. Losses per share came
out at 3.9p (6.2p).
Comparisons have been restated for FRS 3.
Sales at Spottiswoode Ballantyne were affected by lower than expected demand
in the first part of the year, but margins improved in the second half and
benefit was gained from the new web press commissioned in June.
Although sales of security products and packaging at Cowells increased
during the year, margins were hit by production disruption, caused by
difficulties in commissioning new machinery for print-ing and plastic card
production.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals shows healthy recovery
to Pounds 2.95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Community Hospitals Group, the private medical care company, recovered from
last year's recessionary malaise to report a healthy 58 per cent increase to
Pounds 2.95m in interim pre-tax profits.
The increase for the six months to December 31 was achieved on turnover
ahead 19 per cent to Pounds 27.2m.
Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, said the profits rise was due to margin
improvement in the hospitals division and the contribution from new nursing
homes.
The results had also compared to a particularly depressed first half in
1992, which had been hit by higher interest charges and a fall in hospital
revenues.
Mr Dexter was optimistic that the group would maintain growth this year,
albeit at a slower rate.
The interim dividend is increased by 17 per cent to 2.8p, payable from
earnings up 53 per cent to 6.6p.
The group also offered a 'best view' opinion on full year profits, showing a
pre-tax range of Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 7.8m, on sales in the Pounds 55m to
Pounds 58m range. Earnings per shares were estimated at between 16p and
17.5p.
Operating profits from hospitals were 48 per cent higher at Pounds 3.06m, on
turnover 14 per cent up to Pounds 21.6m. Mr Dexter said the division had
improved operating margins from 10.9 per cent to 14.2 per cent. Costs had
been cut by an estimated Pounds 500,000 on an annualised basis.
The hospitals capital investment programme, which totalled about Pounds 65m
since the group's flotation in 1989, was now largely complete.
The continuing care businesses, including nursing homes, contributed Pounds
1.09m at the operating level, against Pounds 660,000 last year. Some Pounds
300,000 of the improvement was contributed by three new nursing homes.
Turnover was 49 per cent higher at Pounds 5.63m, and occupancy rates for the
operational homes rose to 91 per cent from the high 80s.

FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Second half boost for Grafton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A marked improvement in second half trading enabled Grafton Group, the
Dublin-based builders' merchant, to lift full year pre-tax profits by 7 per
cent to IPounds 4.13m (Pounds 3.97m).
The directors said that a general reduction in interest rates and renewed
economic confidence had had a positive impact on construction demand and
consumer spending in all of the company's main markets.
Sales for the 12 months to end-December rose by 9 per cent to IPounds 104.9m
(IPounds 96.4m). For the second six months they rose by 16 per cent.
Lower interest rates resulted in a reduction in interest charges from
IPounds 1.23m to IPounds 692,000.
Earnings per share improved from 18.6p to 20.9p and a final dividend of
4.25p makes an increased total of 7.25p (6.5p).
The directors expect Grafton to 'benefit strongly' in 1994 from improved
markets and from substantial investments in recent years to strengthen the
operating position.
The opening six months to June 30 saw pre-tax profits fall from IPounds
1.85m to IPounds 1.21m. Turnover was virtually static at IPounds 48.6m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Breweries, the regional brewer and pubs operator, said yesterday that
it was revaluing its estate and was in talks with its bankers regarding a
possible restructuring of its obligations.
The company also said that it was reviewing its strategy and a number of
acquisition opportunities which could significantly broaden the base of its
activities.
The board hopes to conclude the discussions shortly.
In August, United announced a reduction in pre-tax losses to Pounds 189,376
(Pounds 283,607) for the six months to May 31. The possibility of a capital
restructuring was mentioned at the same time.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Only the vows will satisfy the sceptics -
Why the float of 3i is again being proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the promised wedding between institutional investors and 3i, the UK's
leading provider of equity finance to small and medium-sized businesses, is
finally held this summer it will mark the end of one of the most prolonged
and turbulent courtships the stock market has ever known.
The suggestion that the six clearing banks and the Bank of England which own
3i - formed in 1945 as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation -
may finally float up to 40 per cent of its equity provokes some natural
scepticism. The notion of a float has been around for up to a decade.
Yet the banks, led by National Westminster and Barclays, which between them
own 41 per cent of 3i's equity, have good reason to support a 3i float now.
'There is hardly going to be a better time. It is just common sense really,'
said a director of one of the shareholding banks yesterday.
The last attempt to float 3i early in 1993 came to grief because National
Westminster and Barclays decided that they would not gain enough from
selling their stakes. Although 3i's net assets had risen to Pounds 1.3bn by
then, the sale price was not likely to be sufficiently attractive.
This is because NatWest, which holds a 23.1 per cent stake, is among
shareholders which equity account for 3i. This allows them not only to gain
from 3i dividends but from the rise in net asset values. This is thought to
add about Pounds 15m a year to NatWest profits, in addition to the dividend
income.
This means that the float price for 3i becomes a delicate calculation. Banks
such as NatWest have to gain enough from the one-off sale of part of their
stakes in return for giving up regular income. The loss would be more
pronounced if it prevented them from equity accounting their stakes.
Accordingly, the rise in the shares of venture capital investment trusts -
the most obvious comparison being Electra - over the past year was very
significant.
The sector discount to net asset values has now fallen to about 11 per cent,
compared with a historic high of 35 per cent.
The most immediate benefit of a flotation for the shareholders is that 3i
will gain investment trust status. At the moment it is classed by the Inland
Revenue as an investment company and is required to pay corporation tax on
profits made from the sale of assets.
Once 3i floats as an investment trust, there will be no corporation tax
liability on the sale of investments and group shareholders' funds will be
that much better off.
As to the size of the float, 3i's advisers, Baring Brothers, and
shareholders are understood to have chosen to sell no more than a third of
the company in order to avoid the substantially greater cost involved in a
larger sale like that of Wellcome shares last year.
The float nevertheless left some of the venture capital industry somewhat
uneasy. Some venture capital groups which are raising new capital are having
an exceptionally difficult time persuading UK institutions to replenish
their funds.
Institutions may have decided not to invest in these new funds in order to
enter the unquoted company sector indirectly via the 3i flotation.
3i added further to the competition for funds earlier this month when for
the first time it raised a Ecu300m (Pounds 227m) fund of its own. 'There is
no doubt potential investors were attracted by the spread of our business
and the enormous deal flow we enjoy,' said Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief
executive.
3i denies the move into fund management has anything to do with the float.
But it is clearly planning to raise further fee-earning funds, possibly for
investment in the UK.
Such a move would inevitably drain funds that might have flowed to the
venture capital groups already focused on investing in smaller unquoted
companies.
By raising funds 3i will also be able to keep more of the deals it finds and
has to syndicate because of its policy of only taking minority stakes in its
investments.
3i could therefore become a significantly less generous provider of deals to
smaller venture capital groups. This is likely to lead to further pressure
for consolidation among the smaller venture capital suppliers within the
industry.
So will 3i change its approach to its market once it becomes a quoted
company and an FT-SE 100 stock to boot?
'We are not going to shorten the time horizons for our investments,' says Mr
Charles Richardson, director of corporate affairs. One of 3i's selling
points, it says, is that it does not push companies to provide investors
with an exit, unlike many other venture capital providers.
A company's management is the 'best judge' of when to seek a float or a
trade sale, 3i says. But the 3i flotation will give it greater flexibility
to sharpen its focus on the smaller unquoted investment sector.
The group is considering, for example, setting up a venture capital
investment trust or regional venture capital trust along the lines proposed
by the chancellor in the last budget. This depends on details of the trusts
which the Treasury expects to announce by the end of the month.
Aside from the financial calculations, the shareholder banks decided that 3i
had reached the stage where it should benefit from the financial discipline
of a Stock Exchange listing. They regarded the group as having reshaped
itself in a way that would withstand investor scrutiny.
Despite the financial and managerial logic, the engagement has been mooted
so long that there will be a sceptical City audience until the vows are
finally exchanged.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Survey finds optimism among smaller
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's smaller companies are bullish about growth prospects in the short
term, in spite of looming tax increases which some have speculated could
hinder economic recovery.
A survey by brokers SG Warburg showed that 74 per cent of companies expected
an improvement in the economy over the next 12 months.
This contrasts sharply with recent public opinion polls, which showed that
only 13 per cent of respondents expected an improvement.
The survey also showed that more companies felt there had been no change in
the timeliness of invoice payment, which was widely considered to be poor.
About Pounds 50bn is estimated to be outstanding on overdue invoices in the
UK. Some 58 per cent of companies questioned favoured the introduction of
statutory interest on late payments. About a third opposed legislation.
The survey, A View From the Boardroom, was based on the responses of 448
chairmen and chief executives of companies with market values of less than
Pounds 300m.
It is Warburg's first attempt to track comprehensively the views of senior
executives in the smaller companies sector. The survey, conducted in January
and February, will be produced on a three or four-monthly basis.
Companies were found to be more optimistic than just three months ago, with
46 per cent of those surveyed saying order books were between 1 per cent and
10 per cent ahead in that period. About a third of companies said orders had
remained static. Two thirds said they expected sales to increase over the
next three months.
The economic growth expected by UK companies is unlikely to mean a change in
employment levels, however.
The consumer goods sector was less optimistic than either the manufacturing
or service industries. This contrasts with recent statistics showing a pick
up in consumer spending.
Some 39 per cent of consumer goods companies reported that import
penetration of their UK markets had 'increased a little'.
Mr Richard Hickinbotham, head of Warburg's smaller companies research team,
said the findings of the survey 'are particularly bullish for small
companies' earnings prospects'.
However, to justify further outperformance in an already buoyant small
company sector, 'we need to see the results of the survey reflected in
company statements and ultimately in meaningful earnings advances', Mr
Hickinbotham said.

Commercial Union, the largest of the UK's composite insurers, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 211m for 1993 - underlining the recovery
in the general insurance market.
The figures, which compared with a profit of Pounds 24m in 1992, were at the
top end of analysts' expectations.
Earnings improved to 55.9p (46.8p) and a final dividend of 9.75p makes a
24.85p (24.35p) total on increased capital.
Like Guardian Royal Exchange, which reported on Tuesday, CU benefited
especially from an improvement in trading conditions in the UK, where
underwriting losses fell to Pounds 57m (Pounds 162m) over the year and an
underwriting profit of Pounds 3m was achieved in the last quarter of the
year.
Mr Peter Foster, general manager finance, said the improvement was
'substantially' due to rate increases, premiums having risen by an average
of 10 per cent on commercial property and 15 per cent on liability and
commercial motor business.
London market marine business had been underwritten at rates between 15 per
cent and 25 per cent higher than in 1992 and rates for domestic business,
mainly house buildings and contents, were described as firm. CU confirmed,
however, that there has been some 'softening' of rates in the motor
insurance market. The company had not cut its own rates but acknowledged
that it had lost market share, shedding between three and four per cent of
its 614,000 policyholders over the year.
In the fourth quarter motor insurance premium income was 18 per cent down on
the same period of 1992, indicating that many of these customers were lost
towards the end of the year.
Mr John Carter, chief executive, cautioned that changes in the way insurers
were assessing motor insurance risks made any assessment of overall rate
movements more difficult. 'Some rates will go down and others up,' he said.
The group also benefited from a low level of weather and subsidence claims,
as well as a reduction in its overheads, following heavy cost-cutting since
1990. Expenses in the UK now amount to only 8.4 per cent of premium income,
compared to about 15 per cent in 1990.
Overall premium income during 1993 increased from Pounds 5.57bn to Pounds
5.97bn. Life income fell to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 2bn), while general
insurance income rose to Pounds 4.07bn (Pounds 3.57bn), with 7 per cent of
the rise due to rate increases and a further 3 per cent attributable to
increased volume.
Investment income rose to Pounds 363m (Pounds 325m) and underwriting losses
fell to Pounds 277m (Pounds 431m). Associated undertakings' earnings were
Pounds 13m (Pounds 19m). Non-life operating profits amounted to Pounds 99m
(loss of Pounds 87m) and life profits were Pounds 119m (Pounds 118m). Pounds
7m was lost after CU closed its Argentine subsidiary.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Bell, TCI call off Dollars 21.4bn merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 21.4bn merger of Bell Atlantic , the US regional company, with
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television service company, has
been called off.
Bell Atlantic blamed the 'unsettled regulatory climate' in the US for the
unravelling of what was to have been the biggest merger in the history of
the US telecommunications industry.
The proposed merger had been widely seen as the most significant move in a
broad convergence of the telephone, cable television, computer and
entertainment industries to create nation-wide 'information superhighways'.
The Clinton administration has endorsed legislation that would allow
telephone companies, such as Bell Atlantic, to enter the field of
multi-media information services, including interactive television.
'This administration will not let existing regulatory structures impede or
distort the evolution of the communications industry,' Vice President Gore
promised at a recent meeting of industry leaders. Differing regulations that
currently apply to telephone and cable television companies should be
harmonised, the vice president said.
However, such changes are yet to be enacted and it now appears that
regulations have in fact deterred Bell and TCI from moving forward with
their merger plans.
The companies said a change in federal cable TV regulations, controlling
prices, made it impossible to close the deal.
'We are disappointed, but the unsettled regulatory climate made it too
difficult for the parties to value the future today,' said Bell's chairman
Raymond Smith
The companies initially set a December deadline to reach a definitive merger
agreement. But the deadline was twice extended. The merger plan also
included Liberty Media, a cable programming company which TCI spun off in
1991 and recently reacquired.
Bell serves the middle part of America's eastern seaboard and has been one
of the most aggressive companies trying to enter the multimedia industry.
TCI has been built up by Mr John Malone, its chief executive, over 20 years
into a company serving some 20 per cent of US homes.

FT  24 FEB 94 / UK banks aim to sell off a third of their 3i stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's high street banks are aiming to sell about one third of the shares
they own in 3i, Europe's largest supplier of venture capital to unquoted
companies, the group has confirmed.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive, estimated yesterday that the sale
would raise between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m.
3i is expected to produce a pathfinder prospectus before its preliminary
results are published in early June, ahead of a summer flotation.
The group said the impetus came from the active shareholders - the four UK
high street banks, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland - and not
from the other shareholder, the Bank of England.
Two years ago 3i postponed a flotation after disagreement among the
shareholders over the value of their investments. Since then, 3i's value has
risen and the discounts at which venture capital investment trusts are
trading to their net asset values have fallen to historically low levels.
The move was greeted with mixed feelings within the venture capital
industry. Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director of Electra, the investment
trust, welcomed the news. 'It will be a FT-SE 100 stock which people will
have to hold in their portfolios,' he said. 'We are always happy that more
people should understand what we are trying to do.'
However, some smaller venture capital providers, which compete more directly
with 3i in providing equity and finance packages, recognise their access to
capital may be squeezed.
Some fund managers say institutions may choose to take an exposure to the
unquoted sector through an investment in 3i rather than through an
investment in a relatively small venture capital fund.
Mr Macpherson dismissed the argument that 3i's shareholders would be selling
at the top of the market.
'It is rather like buying a house. Good houses just don't come along that
often,' he said.
Since 3i last raised funds from its shareholders in 1986, its shareholders'
funds have risen by more than 15 times.
Baring Brothers is adviser to the flotation.

FT  24 FEB 94 / NatWest surges at pre-tax level: Fall in provisions -
Trading surplus rises only 9% / 'Going has been tougher'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 30 per cent fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds
1.26bn, from Pounds 1.79bn, allowed National Westminster Bank to raise
pre-tax profits sharply last year, despite a reduction in income from
lending.
Britain's second biggest bank showed the pressures on high street banks'
lending business, even though non-interest income was boosted by capital
markets and foreign exchange trading, as well as by heavy sales of life
insurance policies.
Although pre-tax profits surged to Pounds 989m from Pounds 367m in 1992, the
trading surplus of income over expenses rose by only 9 per cent to Pounds
2.4bn, against Pounds 2.2bn. Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, said this was
achieved through tight management of costs and efforts to diversify sources
of income. 'The going has been a lot tougher' in the UK branch banking
operations, which returned to a profit of Pounds 180m, compared with a
Pounds 137m loss. He anticipated that lending would 'remain subdued for some
time.'
Net interest income fell by 2 per cent to Pounds 3.68bn, partly because the
net interest margin on assets narrowed from 3 per cent to 2.8 per cent.
Increased competition for domestic savings contributed to the margin fall.
The return on ordinary equity rose to 10.8 per cent, against 3 per cent,
although the bank's stated target is 17.5 per cent. Lord Alexander said the
return was inadequate. The bank was confident that it could reach its target
rate, but it might have to consider reducing that target if UK inflation and
interest rates remained low.
The most profitable business sector of the bank was NatWest Markets, its
corporate and investment banking arm, which made a profit of Pounds 453m,
against Pounds 232m. There were record profits in capital markets.
NatWest Life, the life insurance subsidiary, contributed Pounds 60m to
profits, while Lombard North Central, the assets and personal finance arm,
increased profits to Pounds 178m, compared with Pounds 116m for the previous
15 months.
Assets weighted by risk fell by Pounds 4.5bn to Pounds 103.4bn because of a
lack of lending growth. With retained earnings of Pounds 276m, this helped
the ratio of tier one capital to risk-weighted assets to rise from 5.2 to
5.7 per cent.
Expenses increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 4.58bn, including a 4 per cent
rise in staff costs. This was partly cause by a rise in staff profit-sharing
and profit-related pay, despite a net reduction of 3,800 in staff numbers.
NatWest raised its total dividend by 6 per cent to 18.5p, after a final
payout of 12.1p (11.375p). The increase in the total was less than those
made by TSB Group and Lloyds.
Earnings per share advanced from 10p to 35p.
The shares closed 28.5p down at 503.5p.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Credit Lyonnais seeks to raise Pounds 2.3bn from asset sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, is planning to
sell more than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.29bn) of assets over the next two years to
repair its balance sheet.
A spokesman confirmed the bank's policy of disposing of a significant part
of its investment portfolio, although he declined to specify the exact
target. 'The amount and the timing will depend on market conditions,' he
said.
The move is an important step in the loss-making bank's restructuring, which
is also expected to include a state-backed capital increase of between
FFr3bn and FFr4bn and the transfer of non-performing property assets to a
newly created shell company.
Industry analysts described the decision to sell assets as a positive step.
They estimated the bank suffered losses of up to FFr4bn in 1993 which could
push its capital ratio below 8 per cent.
'It is a good move,' said Mrs Jennifer Oliver Martin, banking analyst at
Morgan Stanley. 'It should strengthen the balance sheet by reducing assets
and achieving some capital gains.'
Observers said the first move would probably be a reduction in the bank's
relatively liquid shareholdings in listed companies. These include stakes in
Bouygues, the construction group, Bollore, the engineering and shipping
company, and Navigation Mixte, the diversified holding company in which
Credit Lyonnais holds 14 per cent.
The bank also holds stakes in several state-owned companies, including
Usinor-Sacilor, the steel group, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace group. The
total value of Credit Lyonnais' shareholdings is estimated at about FFr55bn.
Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on other elements of its restructuring
plan. Negotiations with the government concerning a capital increase and the
creation of a shell company for property loans are, however, thought to be
near completion.

FT  24 FEB 94 / BAe cuts losses and posts higher dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace yesterday reported a sharply reduced Pounds 237m pre-tax
loss for 1993 reflecting lower exceptional costs together with a return to
profits at the operating level.
The pre-tax loss, which compares with the group's record breaking Pounds
1.2bn deficit in 1992, was struck after Pounds 308m of exceptional charges
including a further Pounds 250m provision to cover potential losses on
aircraft financing leases. The 1992 results included Pounds 1bn of
exceptional charges.
Despite the continued losses, the board signalled its confidence in the
future by proposing an increased final dividend of 5p, from 4p, making 8.3p
for the year - a 19 per cent advance. The group's shares closed up 9p at
549p.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's outgoing chairman, said 1993 had marked 'a turning
point' with real progress being made towards refocusing the group on its
strengths in defence and aerospace, including the recently announced sale of
Rover Cars to BMW.
Over the past year BAe has also sold its Corporate Jets business and the
Ballast Nedham group of construction companies.
Mr Cahill, who is stepping down after only two years of his five-year term
and will be replaced by a part-time non-executive chairman, Mr Bob Bauman,
said BAe 'has made the culture change from a 'cost plus' to a 'cost
conscious' company'.
Excluding provisions, the group posted a Pounds 229m operating profit
compared with a Pounds 66m loss the previous year, on sales which increased
by 7.85 per cent to Pounds 10.8m.
The turnround at the operating level was led by the motor vehicle operations
which turned a Pounds 49m loss in 1992 into a Pounds 56m profit on sales
which rose by almost 17 per cent to Pounds 4.3m.
The other highlight was a halving of the losses on commercial aircraft
operations which fell from Pounds 337m to Pounds 162m, on sales which grew
to Pounds 1.58bn (Pounds 1.49bn.)
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said that despite the stalled talks with
Taiwan Aerospace over a regional aircraft joint venture, the main objective
of the regional aircraft operations continued to be to position both the
Jetstream and Avro businesses into international groupings to reduce risk
and enhance market access.
Mr Evans added that it had been 'a good year' for Airbus in which BAE has a
20 per cent stake. He said the European aircraft manufacturer moved into
profit in the second half helped by a richer mix of sales.
The core defence operations turned in another solid performance contributing
Pounds 345m (Pounds 352m) to profits on flat sales of Pounds 3.96bn (Pounds
4bn) while increasing their order book by Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 8.8bn. Mr
Evans said that since 1988 profits per employee had increased fourfold.
Interest charges increased from Pounds 126m to Pounds 186m. After tax of
Pounds 6m (Pounds 272m) and minorities, the net loss was Pounds 214m (Pounds
888m.)
However the larger than expected Pounds 326m operating cash inflow enabled
BAe to end the year with reduced net debt of Pounds 165m (Pounds 257m)
representing gearing of 9.9 per cent. Shareholders funds fell to Pounds
1.51bn (Pounds 1.78bn.)

<TEXT>
British Aerospace said yesterday that the Rover vehicles business had
achieved a Pounds 128m turnround in 1993 at the trading level before taking
into account exceptional items. Rover's profit before interest, but
including exceptional items, rose to Pounds 56m last year from a loss of
Pounds 49m.
The Land Rover four-wheel drive vehicle operations accounted for the lion's
share of the profits, and BAe refused to disclose whether the car operations
alone had managed to break even.
Total Rover group vehicle production (including Land Rover) rose 6.2 per
cent last year to 430,211 from 404,971. Within this total, production of the
Honda Concerto fell to 18,406 from 32,444.
Mr George Simpson, Rover group chairman, said capital expenditure by Rover
rose by Pounds 12m to Pounds 222m last year and had averaged Pounds 200m a
year in the last five years. The workforce increased to 33,900 at the end of
1993 from 33,500. The number of white collar jobs had been cut, but
production workers had been added at the Solihull and Cowley assembly
plants.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Lilley signed Matrix 'gag' order after opposing trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley agreed to restrict information wanted by the defence in the
Matrix Churchill court case even though he believed the trial should not go
ahead, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Lilley, now social security secretary, signed a public interest immunity
(PII) certificate in the committal proceedings of the Matrix Churchill trial
after his officials dissuaded him from attempting to stop it.
'It was pointed out to me that it would be quite improper for a minister to
interfere with an independent prosecuting authority (Customs). Had I
interfered, I think there would have been a very different inquiry going on
now,' Mr Lilley said.
He said that while serving as trade secretary he had concluded that the
prosecution would 'certainly fail' after learning that one of the
businessmen being prosecuted had been working for British intelligence.
He had also accepted a key aspect of the defence case - that businessmen
charged with illegally exporting arms to Iraq had carried out their
activities on the basis of advice given to them by Mr Alan Clark, a former
trade minister.
Mr Lilley defended his signing of a PII certificate on the basis that there
was a 'collective ministerial responsibility' to protect the confidentiality
of advice given to ministers by officials.
'You can't unilaterally blow a hole in it (the system of PIIs) and expect to
remain on board the ship,' he said after being asked by Lord Justice Scott
whether he had any discretion not to sign.
Mr Lilley also said he been advised by government lawyers that none of the
documents he was attempting to suppress would have any 'significant
relevance' in the Matrix Churchill case.
However, the legal position of ministers signing PII certificates was again
challenged by Lord Justice Scott, who made it clear that he considers the
subject a central issue of his inquiry.
With his counsel, Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, referring to specific documents
covered by Mr Lilley's certificate, the judge questioned the necessity of
the minister signing a 'class claim' covering suppression of a wide range of
Whitehall documents, some of which the defence claimed were vital to ensure
a fair trial. Mr Lilley said he had once questioned why, as a minister, he
had no more power than that of 'a limited role in classifying documents',
but did not receive a 'satisfactory answer'.
The minister's evidence last night fuelled the Labour party's growing
offensive against the government over the Scott inquiry.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, said it
'beggared belief' that a cabinet minister knew the Matrix Churchill
prosecution was a 'mistake' but could do nothing to 'stop a trial that could
have put innocent men in prison'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Tories split over European allies' federal stance in poll
manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European People's party, the grouping that includes Britain's
Conservative party, will call tomorrow for a federal European Union with a
single currency and an independent central bank.
The group's manifesto for the European parliament elections in June was
agreed three weeks ago, but has been kept under wraps to avoid embarrassing
the Conservative party, which is deeply divided about the contents.
The manifesto will be released without fanfare in Brussels tomorrow.
However, a French translation obtained by the Financial Times says that the
EPP's member parties have decided 'to make the process of European
integration and unification proceed resolutely'.
The manifesto says that economic and monetary union is 'indispensable' to
stability and prosperity, and that the Union is 'incomplete' without the
social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
It also calls for a European constitution; cross-border policing; a common
external frontier giving control of visas for non-Europeans to the Union;
harmonisation of national guidelines governing political refugees; a common
defence and security policy and stronger powers for Europe's parliament.
'It is only through a federal structure that the European Union can
guarantee the respect and diversity of the national and regional identities
and at the same time engender the common effort that is necessary to solve
the problems of the future of Europe,' it says.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, said the party was not
committed to the EPP manifesto. 'We will be standing on a British
Conservative manifesto,' he said.
Officials also pointed out that Mr John Major, the prime minister, has
secured an opt-out from some of the federalist elements of the manifesto,
such as economic and monetary union and the social chapter.
However, the EPP document will inevitably refocus attention on the party's
unsuccessful attempts to paper over a deep split on Europe, which emerged
during the debate on the Maastricht treaty last year.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East and a leading critic of the EU,
said his party was 'closely integrated' with the EPP, which whips its
members along Westminster lines and has common spokesmen on departmental
issues.
'It is quite clear that the EPP is setting out in detail the principles of a
centralised socialist state in which a wide range of policies which have
been condemned by the Conservative party are set out and developed,' he
said.
'I genuinely don't see how the Conservative party can live with the kind of
arrangement that we have had. I would be happier being linked to the British
Labour party than to this extreme socialist party.'
The Conservatives' problems will be compounded today when European MPs vote
on a report on the Maastricht treaty, drafted by a Luxembourg member of the
EPP, which condemns Britain's decision to opt-out from the social chapter.

FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the turbulence of the last week, the Bank of England must be glad to
have got yesterday's gilts auction away successfully. But if the cover of
1.5 times looks respectable, the six basis point difference between the
average and the lowest accepted yield leaves room for doubt about the
strength of demand. It looks as though cover was boosted by a number of
rogue bids submitted on the off chance of picking up paper on the cheap.
With overseas demand at a low ebb, it did not help that the Chancellor's
panel of independent advisers was lukewarm about further interest rate cuts
on Tuesday. That sapped confidence at the short end of the market, while Mr
Alan Greenspan's soothing words to Congress have not yet fully calmed
sentiment at the longer end of international markets. At some stage, the
positive fundamentals should draw buyers out again. After all, inflation is
low and at least one more cut in UK rates remains in prospect. Gilts' 70
basis point yield premium over US Treasury issues is a good starting point
for a recovery. But it may take a while to make itself felt.

<TEXT>
It was understandable that CU should sing sweet lullabies to the market
following the screaming that accompanied GRE's warnings of softening rates.
But it is doubtful that CU's reassurances will be enough to reverse the
sector's weakness. CU's figures confirm that private motor insurance may
have peaked. But at least CU is in the enviable position that having gained
market share in the upswing it can afford to lose volumes when rates turn
down. The 18 per cent decline in fourth-quarter private motor premium income
shows how quickly it has reacted.
In past cycles, weakness in one market has quickly spilled into others as
insurers have sought to offset market share losses. CU suggests the motor
sector is driving down its own by-way this time and that rates are still
firming elsewhere. If so, it is difficult to believe that composite insurers
are not undervalued. Motor insurance is a small proportion of overall
business. CU is well capitalised following its rights issue, yields more
than 5 per cent and has scope to maintain a progressive dividend policy. A
strong life business adds another defensive dimension.
But such theoretical considerations will carry little weight with anyone
other than value funds. The market's fears may be premature but they are not
wrong. Even if it is shown that the market has over-reacted, it is unclear
that CU will benefit. Legislative changes in the US are beginning to cast a
worrying shadow.

FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: National Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After TSB, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland raised their dividends by 20
per cent or more, the stock market decided that a mere 6 per cent increase
from National Westminster was stingy and marked the shares down accordingly.
It would have cost only another Pounds 40m to increase the dividend by 20
per cent and cover would still have been close to 1.7 times. That NatWest
chose to be cautious suggests both doubts of its own about growth and that
it is still anxious to conserve its capital. Tier 1 capital has risen to 5.7
per cent from 5.2 but half the improvement was due to a Pounds 4bn drop in
weighted risk assets.
Unlike Lloyds, which has plenty of capital and sees signs of a revival in
loan demand, NatWest maintains that loan demand is sluggish. Were it to
recover, the bank has ample scope to create new tier 1 capital by converting
the exchangeable capital securities it issued last year. In that sense, it
is simply being economic, operating flexibly with just enough capital to
meet the needs of the moment. Such an approach would be laudable if it
produced a high return. NatWest's net return on shareholders' funds is 10.8
per cent, half that of Lloyds.
It is difficult to see where the earnings will come from to boost that
return. NatWest points proudly to the growing importance of non-interest
income, but that is inevitable when interest income is falling. Since fee
income is flat, the main driving force has been dealing profits and
so-called 'other' income, which includes a commendable contribution from
insurance but a jumble of other items such as venture capital and securities
gains. NatWest has scope to grow, for example, in its Coutts private banking
division. The bank itself is talking of a 'sensible' acquisition in the US.
It would never make a foolish one, would it?

FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Defensive strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise in British Aerospace's results yesterday was that there were no
surprises. That was not because the company has been flouting the
puritanical rules on disclosure post-LIG, but more that BAe seems to have
broken with its long habit of producing dead rabbits from hats. Indeed,
there were even some pleasant developments. The Pounds 128m turnround in
Rover's underlying profits, while flagged at the time of the BMW deal, was
rather lost in the hullabaloo. The figure is a credit to the transformation
of the company, though BAe will no longer benefit from the work. And as it
owes much to Land Rover, where sales rose by 30 per cent, it hints at some
of the goodies BMW has in store.
Shorn of most of Professor Sir Roland Smith's distractions, BAe is left with
two main challenges. Operating losses of Pounds 120m in turboprop aircraft
this year, and perhaps Pounds 80m thereafter, need to be curbed. Finding a
joint venture partner is a priority, though the worry must be that, with the
market so poor, two badly bleeding operations may be merged into one badly
bleeding operation. Grinding out defence profits from the order book is the
other task, and while costs have been cut, the suspicion remains that there
is more to go for.
From the market's perspective, the limited visibility of defence earnings
and the uncertainty over margins are a concern. Since the company must also
persuade doubters that it is not in the hands of a defence mafia, more
detail on the business would serve both purposes. The greater the confidence
in the exposed core of the company, the lower the discount the market will
apply to those profits. Yet even given that healthy degree of scepticism,
BAe's earnings prospects for the next two years imply plenty of upside for
the shares.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Personal View: Safety net for pensions custodians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN FRANKS and STEPHEN SCHAEFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taken together, the following three events are rather surprising. First,
about Pounds 400m is discovered to be missing from the Maxwell pensions
funds. The problem, so far as we know, had nothing to do with underfunding
or with poor investment performance. Rather, the money just was not with the
custodians, where it was supposed to be. Second, in the wake of what is
surely the most serious financial scandal of recent times, the government
asked a committee under Professor Goode to examine the law as it applies to
pensions. The report does not propose any substantive changes in the area of
safe custody and, in particular, does not recommend making the use of
independent custodians mandatory. Among the reasons given is that the use of
custodians may 'give the semblance of protection without the reality'.
Third, in its 'Custody Review', the Securities and Investments Board says
that it does not feel the case has been made for bringing custody under the
regulatory umbrella and making it an authorisable activity.
Can all this make sense? Goode is right to have doubts about the
contribution which commonly existing forms of custody can make to the safety
of client assets. A custodian typically works under a contract drawn up by
the pension fund trustees. Duties will typically include the safe-keeping of
assets, their delivery or receipt after authorised transactions, and the
provision of a reporting system. Such a contract will usually not require
the custodian to use its judgment and discretion to protect the assets of
investors but rather to follow the instruction of the pension fund trustees
or their delegates. If the trustees instruct the custodian to deliver client
assets to some third party, as appears to have occurred in the Maxwell case,
the custodian will do it so long as this is consistent with the custody
contract (which it usually will be). In contrast, our view is that the form
of the contract can be altered substantially to improve protection for
client property against fraud and misuse.
One of the principles of protecting investors is that those with
responsibility ought to be in a position to provide compensation if that
responsibility is abused. In pension funds the responsibility lies with the
trustees but they are rarely able to provide compensation. Regulating
custodians will not change this substantially. This may be why the SIB does
not support making custody an authorisable activity and why Professor Goode
does not favour mandating the use of custodians. What pensions regulation
ought to focus on, however, is the type of contract under which custodians
operate. It should be a legal requirement that the contract with custodians
provides a duty of care to the trust fund and its beneficiaries rather than
the trustee. One implication for the Maxwell type of case would be that, if
the trustees were to give instructions to the custodian which the latter
considered prejudicial to the interests of pension fund beneficiaries, the
custodian would be obliged to refuse to carry out such instructions, and
failing that would be liable for the consequences. This would also have the
effect of providing another 'whistleblower' for beneficiaries just as
Goode's proposals would do in the case of auditors. If this change were made
it would be necessary to subject custodians to a 'fit and proper' test and
to minimum capital requirements to ensure they can meet liabilities in the
event of claims against them. This, in turn, would require that custody
becomes an authorisable activity.
We believe this approach would be more effective than Professor Goode's
proposals, which would create a fund to compensate pension fund
beneficiaries in the event that the assets were misappropriated. A
compensation scheme will do nothing to diminish the incidence of fraud;
indeed, it is nothing more than a compulsory insurance scheme where the
premiums will (almost certainly) be unrelated to the risks. Honest firms
will subsidise dishonest firms, efficient firms will subsidise inefficient
firms and the scheme will weaken the incentive for firms to take sensible
actions on their own behalf to prevent fraud. If a compensation scheme has a
role at all, it should not be the principal weapon in the current drive to
protect the investor against fraud. It would be far better to give a greater
role to properly regulated custodians, to let the market for custody
services discriminate between good risks and bad risks and to leave any
compensation scheme to cope with the few cases that slip through the net.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Trans-Alpine road traffic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One cannot help feeling sympathy with the Swiss and the Austrians. Nationals
of both countries are horrified at the prospect of yet more lorries
thundering through the Alps, spewing out pollution and destroying the
natural beauty.
Such emotions are behind last weekend's Swiss referendum, in which a
majority voted to ban all transit lorry traffic through the Alps over 10
years. They also explain the tough stance currently being taken by Austria
in its negotiations to join the European Union. It wants to maintain, for
another 10 years, restrictions on the number of EU lorries allowed to cross
Austria.
The Austrians and Swiss have their hearts in the right place. The
environmental damage caused by trans-Alpine road traffic must be curtailed.
But the means both countries are employing to achieve this goal leave much
to be desired and threaten to disrupt relations between them and other
European countries.
The main problem is the discriminatory nature of the policies. In
Switzerland's case, only transit traffic is to be banned. Lorries travelling
within the country or between Switzerland and other countries will not be
affected. The main loser will be traffic between the north and south of
Europe, particularly between Germany and Italy.
Similarly, Austria wishes to keep its 'eco-points' system, which limits the
number of lorries allowed to cross the country. This is an environmentally
adjusted quota system: transit quotas are given to each Union country and
then adjusted according to how dirty the lorries are. Again, only transit
traffic is affected. In this case, a big loser is Greece.
Sticking point
Both the Swiss and Austrian approaches are causing friction with the
European Union. In the Swiss case, discrimination is not the only issue. The
referendum, which is binding unless repealed by another referendum, means
the government will not be able to abide by the terms of an accord with the
EU on lorry traffic. The EU will rightly worry whether future agreements
with the Swiss government are worth the paper on which they are written.
But the Austrian dimension is more pressing because Alpine traffic has
become a sticking point in the enlargement negotiations which are near their
deadline. The talks were always going to be difficult. But the knock-on
effects of the Swiss referendum have made things worse. Austrians are afraid
that traffic banned from crossing Switzerland will be diverted through their
Alps instead.
A way must be found of reconciling the environmental concerns of the Alpine
nations with the need to move goods between different parts of Europe. The
obvious solution is to place a greater emphasis on rail transport. This, in
turn, requires more investment in rail infrastructure and a tilting of the
economic incentives so that haulage companies find it attractive to switch
their goods from road to rail.
Little progress
Switzerland has made much progress in switching traffic from road to rail.
Nearly 80 per cent of transit traffic already goes this way. Matters will be
improved when the new SFr20bn Gotthard rail tunnel is complete. The country
also plans to link lorry road taxes to the distance they travel.
Austria, by contrast, has made little progress in improving its trans-Alpine
rail infrastructure. Feasibility studies for a new Ecu10bn rail link through
the Brenner pass are not yet finished, meaning completion is at least 10,
and perhaps 20, years away. It is possible, though, that the Brenner link
will receive a fillip as part of the European Union's trans-European
networks initiative which is now gaining momentum. The European Commission
is holding a meeting of Alpine states to discuss trans-Alpine infrastructure
next month.
Austria's concerns, of course, cannot wait until this process is concluded.
The deadline for the enlargement talks is too pressing.
The Union must therefore publicly and swiftly reassure Austria that it fully
sympathises with its desire to protect the Alps. But it must continue to
stress that such protection must be applied on a non-discriminatory basis.
Evenhandedness would not only be fairer to EU countries. It would also offer
greater protection for the environment.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Nice benefits, whatabout the borders: Andrew Adonis asks if
the performance of the UK telecoms industry offers an example for other
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is Europe's telecommunications laboratory. For the past decade it
has pioneered policies of privatising and promoting competition far in
advance of the rest of the European Union. Even US companies, generally
considered to have more advanced telecoms systems, regard it as a test bed
for new services they may introduce back home.
Other EU states - most immediately Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany -
are embarking on telecoms privatisations. Deregulation is also advancing
across Europe; competition between providers of basic voice services will be
allowed by 1998 in most EU states.
A sound assessment of the UK's experience is therefore important. That makes
a government-sponsored study of the international competitiveness of UK
telecoms infrastructure, published this week, essential reading. The study,
prepared by Mr Robert Harrison of the London-based PA Consulting Group, is
not an unqualified paean of praise, though some of the shortcomings it
identifies are as much Europe-wide as British. Its findings have significant
implications, however, for other countries going down the UK route.
Overall, the report ranks UK telecoms performance 'consistently a good
second', often to the US. It does not put the UK out in front in any field.
But that may be unfair in the case of regulation, given the UK government's
innovative decision to license combined cable TV and telephone operators, a
move which has demonstrated the economies available from dual provision and
stimulated competition in a field - the local network - previously regarded
as a natural monopoly.
The US looks set to proceed down a similar road, and several US Baby Bell
companies will be able to apply back home the experience they have gained
investing a total of nearly Pounds 5bn in urban cable networks in the UK.
Britain also scores well in the areas of network investment and mobile
communications. In cash terms its network investment for 1990 is ranked
behind the US, Japan and Germany but, after adjustments for differences in
equipment prices paid by different operators, the UK's investment per line
ranks second only to the US. UK network operators boast open procurement
policies. In any case, all or part of the UK's largest domestic equipment
suppliers have been sold to overseas companies in the last decade, weakening
old ties.
The implication is stark: the incestuous relationships between the
state-owned European tele-coms operators and indigenous equipment suppliers
are lead-ing operators to pay excessive prices for equipment.
Similarly, in cellular communications, the UK policy of encouraging
competition from the mid-1980s, and limiting the role played by BT, the
former monopoly operator of fixed-wire services, has paid dividends.
Penetration of cellular mobile services is far higher in the UK than in
Germany, the Netherlands and France, although it still lags behind the
Scandinavian countries.
Looking ahead, how well placed is the UK in the race to realise in Europe
the 'super-highway' vision of high-capacity networks, providing interactive
entertainment and communications, trumpeted by Vice-President Al Gore in the
US?
Mr Gore is determined to leave the new networks' construction to the private
sector. Telecoms companies appear to be responding: several Baby Bells have
announced upgrading programmes in the past few months, aiming to replace
copper wires with fibre in local networks. At least three of them - Nynex,
US West and Bellsouth - are also undertaking commercial experiments with
fibre connected not just to businesses, but to homes, schools and hospitals.
In the UK, BT has until now appeared keener on spending sprees abroad than
on upgrading its network at home - witness its Dollars 5.3bn splash last
year on a stake in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance carrier, while
its UK investment was bottoming out.
BT has claimed that a government ban on it providing entertainment services
over its own network until at least 2001 made it uneconomic to lay fibre in
the local network. Some observers feared that the government was promoting
competition in basic telephony at the expense of network modernisation.
However, Mr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development and procurement,
indicated yesterday that BT might be on the verge of launching a massive
programme to extend fibre to the local network. BT is coming to recognise
that its future depends on developing a high-capacity network akin to that
envisaged in the US. If it goes forward, it will be the largest network
investment programme since digitalisation, and will make Britain one of the
first European states to go fully down the local fibre route. 'It's all
about timescale: we might even take fibre right into the home,' said Mr
Rudge.
If consumers are ever to use the new 'super-highways', operators will not
only have to invest in new networks, but make the services affordable.
Unfortunately, the DTI study gives only cursory attention to the crucial
area of pricing and the impact of competition in driving down margins that
have historically been kept high in many countries, as a surrogate form of
national taxation.
One study cited in the report suggests that in 1992 BT charged higher
residential prices than six other large national operators (see graph),
while its business prices were significantly lower than those of France,
Germany, Japan and the US. However, a 1993 survey, comparing calls of set
distances and charge bands between the seven countries, shows BT in a more
favourable light, although still more expensive than the Netherlands, Sweden
and the US.
The comparisons, though tentative, lend weight to the argument that
competition has driven down prices. Significantly, until recently
competition in the UK centred almost exclusively on the business market:
Mercury, BT's sole rival until the abolition of the post-privatisation
duopoly in 1991, has about two-thirds of the City of London's outgoing
long-distance telecoms traffic, but has only just started pitching seriously
for large-scale residential traffic.
It has taken Mercury nearly a decade to take a 10 per cent market share in
the UK telecoms market. Compared with new competitors in US, Australia and
New Zealand, its progress has been glacial.
Differences in national regulation may account for Mercury's slow
development, but the effect has been to allow BT to safeguard its margins
and profits, checked only by a price cap set by Oftel, the regulator. A
telling comparison can be made between BT's pricing policy and that of New
Zealand Telecom, forced into aggressive, almost weekly price-cutting last
summer and autumn to fend off a new competitor, Clear Communications, which
had gained an 18 per cent share of the long-distance market in barely two
years.
However, competition in Britain can achieve only so much on its own. The DTI
highlights two areas where European prices are uncompetitive compared with
the US.
First, on leased lines. The differential between internal long-distance and
cross-border public call charges has been a long-standing grievance. But it
applies also to leased lines, critical to the business market. According to
the DTI study, a leased line between France and Germany costs nearly twice
as much as the same line leased within either of the two countries, and
about 16 times as much as a 200km leased line in the US.
Second, the cost of very high bandwidth leased lines - capable of carrying
far greater telecoms volumes - is equally distorted. In Germany, the costs
of such leased circuits can be five times as much as in the US. Mr Harrison,
the report's author, said: 'This difference in tariffing policy between the
US and other countries means that users in the US tend to regard bandwidth
as a commodity, and face a far lower cost penalty in experimenting with
broadband applications.'
Though benefits from liberalisation in Britain appear considerable, and may
give the country a competitive edge in the EU, a clear lesson from this
week's study is the limitations of liberalisation in one country. To
maintain a competitive edge against the US in telecoms, England's borders
must extend to the Rhine.

Reading the runes - ie Lonrho's latest annual report - one might think so.
It lacks his usual statement and big picture at the start of the report.
Retiring chairman, Rene Leclezio, has taken over the slot.
Could it be occupied next year by Rowland's joint chief executive, Dieter

For that to happen Rowland would have to be long retired.

Labour's heroic struggle to win friends and influence people in the business
community moved last night to the Pavilion restaurant in Soho, where a
modest dinner - Pounds 20 a head - was hosted by Robin Cook, the party's
irrepressible trade and industry spokesman.
Cook has agreed to become president of a new group, the Forum For Business
and Industry. The forum says it will recruit some industrial big guns and
act as a sounding board for Labour's nascent industrial plans.
More practically, it will also help foot the bill for the painstaking
process of constructing policy.
Forum members will be expected to cough up Pounds 500 a year to help fund
activities. So far 25 recruits have signed up; who they are is currently
being kept under wraps. But perhaps a policy costing only Pounds 12,500 to
develop is not much to shout about.

Whatever happened to Alan Wheatley, the former senior London partner of
Price Waterhouse? Yesterday should have been his big day. Final confirmation
came that 3i, the venture capital giant, is to be floated on the stock
market and Tring, the budget CD company, made its stock market debut. By
rights Wheatley should have been chairman of both companies.
However, Wheatley quit as chairman of 3i last April, after less than a year
in the job, because 3i's planned stock exchange flotation had been delayed.
In October he was tipped to be chairman of Tring, a budget CD and cassette
group, which was planning to come to the market.
Once again the flotation was delayed he got cold feet.
No doubt Wheatley - a non-exec of Forte, Babcock and Legal &amp; General - had
good reasons for standing down.
But if he really wants to make a name for himself as a company chairman, he
needs to stick with his charges through good times and bad.

Talk about red tape. A group of hacks wanting to visit the Sizewell B

regulations require compliance.
But at least the visitors can hope to keep their trousers on, unlike a
German doctor who visited Scotland's Dounreay power station recently.
Unbeknownst to the poor man, his trews contained a drop of radioactive
iodine used in treating a patient. Alarm bells rang and, since he was inside
the plant, the regulations forbade his departing with radioactive material.
He made his exit in a pair of Dounreay overalls.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few are the occasions when John Major can wait for a speech from Lady
Thatcher with equanimity, particularly at an event organised by Patrick
Robertson of Bruges Group fame.
One such seems set to occur early next month during a London conference
entitled World Trade after Gatt - Issues for Europe and its Competitors. For
a change, Lady Thatcher will be beating the drum for a cause beloved by her
successor when she talks about the need for an open trading system. The
conference is a first for Robertson's Taskforce Communications set up by one
of Lady T's greatest admirers, Lord Parkinson.
Queueing up to listen will be Arthur Dunkel, the long-suffering Gatt
director-general, who oversaw the birth of the Uruguay Round. So will Sir
Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, who will pronounce on international
telecommunications, Laurent Fabius, former French prime minister, on the
reactions of his country, John Flemming, erstwhile chief economist at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on multilateralism, and
DeAnne Julius, British Airways' new chief economist, on trade in services.
Above all, one of the heroes of the round, Sir Leon Brittan, will analyse
the policies of the European Union. So should he and, for that matter, John
Major, wait with pleasurable anticipation for what their former boss will
have to say?
Probably not. It would be surprising if she were not to take the opportunity
to belabour the European Union for its interventionism, protectionism, et
al. Trust that Robertson chap to stir up trouble again.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence planning is one of the most difficult activities that any government
has to engage in. The lead times involved are very long, especially when new
weapons systems have to be designed, tested, commissioned and deployed, a
process that can take up to 20 years. Yet defence postures have to respond
to international circumstances which can change very rapidly, as the last
five years have spectacularly demonstrated.
When, as in this case, the change takes the form of a sudden diminution,
indeed virtual disappearance, of the main threat which a country's defences
had been designed to meet, a wise government will not respond precipitately
by slashing its defence budget, but will take time to assess the new
situation and think through its implications. Judged by that standard, the
French government has been wiser than most of its allies. The defence white
paper it published yesterday was in fact the first since 1972, and purports
to assess France's strategic priorities up to the year 2010. Even now it
does not involve explicit choices about military spending: those will come
in a five-year 'loi de programmation', to be presented in the spring.
Unhappy memories
The contrast with the British procedure is striking. Since 1989, the British
government has resisted pressure for a formal 'defence review' (a phrase
which brings back unhappy memories of successive rounds of cuts in the 1960s
and 1970s). But that did not stop it rushing out, in 1990, a document
entitled 'Options for Change' - misleadingly, since instead of offering a
range of options it imposed a fixed menu of cuts which were unmistakably
'Treasury-driven', rather than a considered response to a new strategic
situation. The inconvenience of this method was all too well illustrated
yesterday when the government, introducing the third and final phase of the
cuts, found itself obliged to send redundancy notices to men serving in
Bosnia, a few days after it had turned down their British commander's
request for reinforcements on the grounds that there are no more troops to
spare.
The French white paper is comparable in conception to the 'Bottom-Up Review'
published last September by the ill-fated US defence secretary, Mr Les
Aspin, though it attempts to look even further ahead, and is in some ways
more radical. It begins by conceding that 'for the first time in history,
there is no direct threat to French frontiers', but seeks to convince the
French public that there are nonetheless real dangers affecting the security
of Europe as a whole, to which France must, with its allies and partners, be
able to respond.
Symbolic legacies
It does not propose either to scrap France's independent nuclear deterrent
or to go back into Nato's integrated command. Thus the two great symbolic
legacies of Charles de Gaulle are preserved. Yet, in a passage which
certainly owes more to the present incumbent of the Elysee than to the
founder of the fifth republic, it does envisage, at least hypothetically, a
future when 'vital European interests, understood as such by Europeans and
others', may make it possible to work out a 'European nuclear doctrine'; and
it does acknowledge Nato as 'the main defence organisation', whose meetings
can be attended on an ad hoc basis by French defence ministers and chiefs of
staff, notably when peacekeeping or, as Nato now calls them, 'peace support'
operations are involved. Thus does doctrine catch up with and legitimise
recent practice.
But armies do not live by doctrine alone. Mr Aspin's Bottom-Up Review was an
honest and lucid document, but congressional experts doubt whether the money
will be found for forces of the size it implicitly calls for. Similarly,
French economists and parliamentarians have noted that, large as it is, the
French defence budget does not cover the cost of all the weapons systems now
planned or in production. The real political test for Mr Francois Leotard,
the defence minister, will come with the loi de programmation; and the test
of France's European commitment will come when its partners ask for the
right for their companies to tender for French defence contracts, or to
acquire equity in French defence companies.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Post-communism: the rival models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries are
to seek assurances this weekend that Russia is taking action to avoid
hyperinflation and control budget deficits.
They have already been given their answer by the head of the Russian central
bank, Victor Gerashchenko (who is a one-man refutation of the more
simple-minded case for central bank independence). Gerashchenko has said
that the Russian government would have difficulty in keeping its 1994
deficit below two or three times the 1993 level, when inflation was 900 per
cent.
If you think that these rates of credit creation and inflation bought any
growth, take a look at the table showing real gross domestic product falling
by double-digit percentages in each of the past three years. It is hardly
surprising that the extreme nationalists and renamed communists did so well
in the recent Russian parliamentary elections.
At this point the whole sad story becomes ammunition for another ideological
debate in the west. One school of thought would use these estimates rather
bitterly to count the cost of western-sponsored reform. Another would use
them to underline the costs of avoiding real reform.
A spirited exposition of the first point of view is provided by the Oxford
political philosopher, John Gray, in a booklet entitled Post Communist
Society in Transition*. Gray, who was once the authorised expositor of
Hayek, now attacks western governments for 'a species of free-market
fundamentalism' in their approach to former communist countries. He calls
the prevailing attitude 'not only intellectually indefensible; it is
politically frivolous, and dangerous in the highest degree'.
One of Gray's strongest points is that by far the most powerful forces in
the former communist countries have been nationalism and religion, which
none of the schools of reformers foresaw or took into account. His avowed
purpose is to go through all the models that have been proposed for the
former communist countries and say that none of them is adequate to the
historical singularities of countries such as Russia. But since even
political theorists cannot just dwell on the uniqueness of each society, he
comes quite near to recommending the Japanese example. His most telling
dictum, however, is that the success of post-communist governments depends
on their ability 'to secure national security, to protect their citizens
from foreign attack, civil strife and organised criminality'.
Gray singles out Harvard's Professor Jeffrey Sachs as a villain of the
piece. The latter has played an effective role in the highly successful
Polish reforms, which are being maintained by a new government containing
many former communists. He has also been an adviser to the reformers in the
Soviet Union and Russia and is more than capable of taking care of himself.
Sachs avoids getting into a debate on whether the new kinds of capitalism
will be based on western ideas of individualism or Confucian ideas of the
supremacy of the family or society. He simply points out that the countries
with which he has been concerned have been faced with a hyperinflation,
which would break down any structure of society unless shock therapy is
undertaken. As he remarks, Gorbachev's Soviet Union and Hungary and Poland
did try gradualist strategies in the 1980s, which ended up in macro-economic
disaster.
In a co-authored article in the November issue of International Economy, he
confronts head-on the frequent references to the Chinese model. China, in
fact, did have a big bang in its rural sector, which accounted for more than
70 per cent of employment in 1978. Within a few years China's leaders
allowed peasant families to move out of agricultural communes and to control
their own farming plots, and also to move to new non-state industries in
rural and coastal areas. China's problem was to generate basic economic
development, starting with a huge surplus agricultural population. Russia's
problem has been that of economic restructuring in a country where more than
85 per cent of the population is in industry and services; but too many of
them are locked into obsolete military-industrial structures.
As for Japan, Sachs reminds us that in 1949 the US imposed a rigorous
IMF-style stabilisation plan. This remark appears in a book on The Political
Economy of Policy Reform, edited by John Williamson, just published by the
Washington Institute for International Economics. Williamson himself goes
some way to meet the Gray-type ideological attack by distinguishing between
what he calls the Washington programme of market-based reform and
Thatcher-Reagan neo-conservative ideology.
Williamson's three slogans are stability, market oriented and
outward-directed reform. His more specific list starts with fiscal
discipline and goes on to public expenditure and tax reform, financial
liberalisation, realistic exchange rates, trade liberalisation, freedom for
inward investment, privatisation and deregulation.
This is not altogether convincing. Even 10 years ago, items such as
privatisation, deregulation or financial liberalisation would not have
appeared on the list; and it is only thanks to the efforts of those who have
been prepared to be tarred with the neo-conservative brush that they have
now become orthodox. Hard science is not to be sought in this area; and the
awful name 'technopols', which Williamson gives to politically powerful
economists, should be dropped like red hot coal. A perfectly good
alternative term is 'political economist'.
The book considers 11 countries that are regarded as successful examples of
reform and two which have failed. The countries covered range from New
Zealand via Poland to Mexico; but neither the Group of Seven main industrial
countries nor Russia and China are covered. The purpose is to establish the
conditions required for successful reform. But most of the candidates -
ranging from social consensus to strong dictatorship, and surprise treatment
to gradualism - appear neither necessary nor sufficient.
The nearest to a common thread is political leadership. But, looked at in
detail, it is a subtle commodity. The leadership that the reforming New
Zealand Labour prime minister, Mr David Lange, gave was for a nuclear-free
South Pacific; this gave his finance minister Roger Douglas a chance to get
his act together.
In Poland, the motivation of the leadership, which gave economic reform its
chance, was the urge to rejoin Europe. Somewhat similar factors were at work
in Mediterranean countries where leftwing leaders could get away with market
policies by asserting they were necessary to become full members of the EU.
But I have run out of space without having had a chance to discuss an issue
that causes acute divisions among political economists of the Washington
consensus. Sachs passionately believes that lack of adequate western aid at
make-or-break moments has much to do with the fall of Yegor Gaidar and other
Russian reformers. The IMF view is that these reformers never had the power
for a credible programme.
Sachs exaggerates the role of overseas help in economic take-off. England,
which first experienced industrial revolution, could not by definition draw
on the resources of earlier pioneers. Where he may be right is that overseas
help can be crucial to the political survival of reform-market governments
hanging on by a thread.
If opportunities have been missed, the IMF is, however, only a minor
culprit. A decision to use economic aid to sustain particular governments in
Russia or elsewhere is a summit one to be made by presidents and prime
ministers and they abandon their duty if they delegate it to 'experts'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong name for cancelled BCCI session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY POPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article, 'Sir Sonny had special loan' (February 16) you repeat
the allegation that a session at a crime symposium at Cambridge University
in 1989 on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and money
laundering 'was cancelled on the directions of the (Commonwealth)
secretary-general's office'.
At the time of the symposium, officials of a branch of the BCCI in the US
had been convicted of money laundering. Sir Sonny Ramphal was then
Commonwealth secretary-general.
Had this suggestion been referred to the secretariat, rather than simply
reported, it would have been made clear that, as the one with overall
responsibility for the programme at Cambridge, I alone was the one who took
the decision not to name the BCCI in the agenda item as such, but gave full
approval for discussion of the money laundering conviction. This in fact
took place. At that stage, there was no reason other than that conviction to
have suspected that the BCCI was engaged in large-scale fraud and money
laundering.
At no time was the question referred to Sir Sonny Ramphal, or referred to
any member of the staff of his private office.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Book Review: Northern exposure for the unskilled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH-SOUTH TRADE: EMPLOYMENT AND INEQUALITY
Clarendon Press, Oxford 482 pages, Pounds 45
In 1930s Britain, a highly qualified professional such as a univer-sity
professor earned seven times the average wage and probably employed two
full-time servants. Now he or she earns about twice the average wage and
might employ someone to clean once a week.
Part of the thesis of Adrian Wood's disturbing book is that levels of
inequality in the developed world not experienced for 50 years are being
re-established as a result of economic convergence between rich and poor
countries.
For most of the period since the second world war there has been a steady
increase in the income of all citizens in the developed world. Though there
have been large differences between the passengers, the ship of state has
sailed ahead with everyone on board.
Adrian Wood believes that the rich and the poor in developed countries are
now in different boats, one rising and one sinking. Like Robert Reich, the
US labour secretary, in his book The Work of Nations, Wood says the dividing
line is no longer between capital and labour but between skilled and
unskilled.
Wood's book is part of a growing body of work on inequality, which seeks to
explain the slump in demand for unskilled labour in developed economies,
manifested in falling real wages for many American workers and persistently
high unemployment in Europe. But what distinguishes it from the received
wisdom is that it places trade with developing countries, rather than
technological change, at the centre of the explanation.
The argument is summed up by the author with typical clarity in the first
paragraph: 'Expansion of trade has linked the labour markets of developed
countries (the north) more closely with those of developing countries (the
south). This greater economic intimacy has had large benefits, raising
average living standards in the north, and accelerating development in the
south. But it has hurt unskilled workers in the north, reducing their wages
and pushing them out of jobs. Northern governments must take action to solve
this problem.'
Few would deny that north-south trade has changed significantly in recent
years. Instead of the south sending raw materials to the north and the north
sending manufactured goods to the south, the relationship is now dominated
by the exchange of manufactured goods. The north sends skill-intensive
computers to the south and the south sends labour-intensive textiles to the
north.
But the scale of the change is often not appreciated. The annual value of
the south's manufacturing exports to the north has increased from virtually
nothing in 1950 to Dollars 250bn in 1990. Some economists say this has had
little net impact on employment in the north. As countries such as South
Korea (where wages have doubled in the past five years) become richer, they
stimulate demand for sophisticated goods from the north. Further, although
Dollars 250bn sounds a big figure, it still represents only 3 1/2 per cent
of the north's consumption of manufactured goods, up from 1 1/2 per cent in
1970. Thus demand for less skilled labour in the north has only been reduced
by a few hundred thousand jobs.
Wood disagrees. He says the impact of trade on labour demand in the north is
10 times greater than most previous estimates and has created a 20 per cent
fall in demand for unskilled labour across the developed world. Previous
calculations, he says, have not accounted for the fact that many northern
companies have responded to the threat of southern competition by
introducing production methods which eliminate low-skill labour. The south's
declining demand for labour-intensive manufactures from the north has also
been ignored, as have large areas of manufacturing where the north no longer
competes.
Not all of these arguments carry equal weight. The observation that northern
companies have introduced new production methods raises the question of why
they were not doing this anyway, if it was profitable to do so. And with
only 18 per cent of employees in Britain working in manufacturing, it seems
implausible that such a far-reaching impact on overall job levels should be
conducted through such a small group.
Why, in any case, is this shift in world trading patterns occurring now?
Supporters of the trade case, such as Wood, say that a large gap opened up
between wages in the developed world and the undeveloped world in the
century to 1960, and that a combination of technology (containerisation),
politics (the end of empire and the removal of trade barriers) and education
(the trebling of literacy rates in the past 30 years) has only allowed this
gap to be exploited by the south relatively recently.
Supporters of the technology case as an explanation for inequality can, just
as convincingly, point to labour-saving innovations, such as robotics, which
did not exist until a few years ago. Nevertheless, Wood has eloquently
raised the profile of trade in the debate about skills, equality and
employment. Rather disarmingly, he accepts that the technology argument
might be equally plausible, but as a strong opponent of protectionism, his
policy prescriptions remain the same.
The solutions are familiar but well argued: more help for unskilled workers
to acquire skills, and income supplements for low-paid workers. The taxes to
finance such initiatives should not destroy the incentive to acquire skills.
The justification for intervention by governments is that it is unfair that
the poorer members of northern society should suffer as a result of changes
which benefit the majority. Those who suffer can also make life unpleasant
for those who do not. It is preferable, says Wood, to be taxed than to be
mugged.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Smokescreen for more work by fewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOB TYRRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Handy has once again produced a rare book (Personal View,
February 21) that analyses incisively and with originality some of the key
dilemmas facing modern managers. In particular, he exposes the tension
produced by calls for flexible and adaptable companies and the need for a
committed and effective core of key knowledge workers. He is also very
persuasive in his prescription for companies suffering this tension.
However he, like the RSA in its recent interim report on its Inquiry into
Tomorrow's Company, is much less convincing in explaining and justifying the
call for tomorrow's company to operate in an 'inclusive' way. Isn't the term
more of a smokescreen than illuminating when applied to the workforce and
the wider community? In what sense can these 'stakeholders' be described as
included when more managers are, as Handy points out, applying the formula '
1/2 x 2 x 3' (half the workforce paid twice as much to produce three times
as much)?
Reconciling the conflicts between global pressures to operate more
competitive companies (part of which means having less intrusive and
'burdensome' state sectors, deregulated labour markets and privatised
welfare states) and the fallout this creates in terms of increasing numbers
of excluded is one of the major social and political challenges facing
Britain. Concealing this conflict behind a warm-hearted but ultimate empty
rhetoric is doing no one any favours.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I run a small, independent financial advice business, with a team both
honest and competent. I have retained 95 per cent of my clients for more
than 20 years, some quite well known. I do not choose to handle clients'
money, yet I have to pay ever increasing fees to Fimbra, the self-regulatory
organisation for independent financial advisers in the UK, to protect the
public from unscrupulous advisers. Now the powers that be are getting rid of
Fimbra, and the Personal Investment Authority is being foisted on us with
even more people who know nothing about financial products peering at our
files and, you have guessed, ever increasing fees.
I am 100 per cent behind consumer protection but, please, is there anyone
out there who can explain to me why Roger Levitt has been discharged from
his Pounds 65m debts and received a sentence of 180 hours' community
service, and why I, and hundreds like me, will be squeezed out of business
in the next few years because of onerous charges?
How I wonder will that help the consumer. But, in any case, do any of you
care?

FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Motives for metals group rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER WHALEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Craven's article (Management: 'Testimony to the German system',
February 18) concerning the rescue of Metallgesellschaft is very disturbing.
Were it not for the involvement of commercial banks as lenders to and
investors in Metallgesellschaft, there would be no need for the Dollars 1bn
plus bailout so hastily arranged in recent weeks. Moreover, Mr Craven makes
only the weakest justification of the company's deliverance from the
liquidators by raising the uncomfortable spectre of lost jobs. He dares
discuss the situation based upon economic utility since the lenders' ability
to protect their secured interests as creditors was compromised by their
conflicting role as shareholders.
No rational person wants to see a company fail or workers put out of their
jobs, yet the rescue of Metallgesellschaft poses a basic economic and moral
dilemma. Investment bankers often mouth platitudes about 'free market'
discipline, but when a large private company in which they hold equity
stakes fails, these same bankers fall back upon the political expedience of
corporate statism. If Metallgesellschaft had 5,800 employees instead of 10
times that number, and the banks involved were lenders rather than investors
too, would Mr Craven be so eager to fashion a rescue? Clearly the answer is
no.
We cannot all equally enjoy the benefits of free-market capitalism without
the taint of favouritism and cronyism unless failure comes as readily as
success. Other firms and their employees that operate in the industries in
which Metallgesellschaft also participates are penalised by the preferential
treatment shown this company, which happens to have bankers on its governing
board as investors and creditors. This is especially true in industries such
as metals and mining, in which over-capacity has severely reduced
profitability in recent years.
The real issue here is not simply conflict of interest. The discussion
should revolve around whether it is appropriate in the first instance for a
bank to use funds raised from depositors and guaranteed by an explicit
government bank safety net to finance and, in this case, replace the equity
of a commercial company, particularly one that squandered its equity through
reckless speculation in volatile energy markets.
Surely this politically motivated rescue is no example for the future of a
stable, healthy and transparent free-market political economy, as Mr Craven
seems to suggest.

Sir, I read with interest your article about government-sponsored guidelines

FT  24 FEB 94 / Arts: Chicago's 'Wozzeck' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the English National Opera did a few seasons ago, but over the span of a
decade, the Lyric Opera of Chicago is offering a conspectus of 20th-century
opera. There were grand plans for Wozzeck: a cast led by Franz Grundheber;
Daniel Barenboim to conduct; and a production by Patrice Chereau, his first
for any American opera company. But the production, which was seen in Paris
last year, turned out to be too expensive for Chicago in its lighting
demands, and so the Lyric Opera set about mounting its own instant version.
Luckily Franz Grundheber survived from the original plans. His Wozzeck here
is, as usual, grave and grey, sung out of a sort of somnolence, an embattled
numbness of spirit, but always capable of sudden rises or falls into
something sweetly melodious for a momentary phrase.
Another survivor from the original project is Graham Clark, who as the
Captain gives a brilliantly precise and vigorous performance, vocally
creating the image of a man who appropriates command as a thin, bright
shield for himself. But in other respects the casting is not so happy.
Kathryn Harries as Marie is hampered by a vibrato that slackly pulls down
the flying kite of her intensity, and Norman Bailey as the Doctor lacks
focus. The staging, too, is a mixed success. Put on the spot, Chicago called
upon a director with plentiful experience of this opera, going back to an
Edinburgh Festival production in the late 1970s: David Alden. This version
has his signatures (the bare light bulb, the blood-smeared surgical gown for
the Doctor), some of his abiding faults (the lack of a feeling of outdoors,
the diversion of musical developments - such as the crisis of the
Wozzeck-Doctor scene - to support groundless stage business), and some
triumphant inventions, new and old.
Many of the most effective innovations come from the use of a ramp on the
stage up towards the audience, so that characters at the front seem enlarged
 -often grotesquely enlarged - against the perspective provided by furniture
and people at the back of the set (designed by Charles Edwards). The strong
use of shadow also works to create powerful dissonances of scale.
However, some of the imagery is adventitious (an instance would be the
slantwise view of modern Chicago occasionally exhibited in a corner) and the
expressionist rhetoric is untrusting of the music. Unfortunately, the
orchestral score is not defending itself under Richard Buckley's baton: much
of the more discontinuous music is a tangle of inert blobs and streaks, and
the performance all through is short-breathed. Perhaps, under the
circumstances, this was the best that could be done. But the Lyric Opera
needs more than decent retrievals to support its fair claim to being
artistically as well as financially the healthiest of the big American
companies.

<TEXT>
PHILADELPHIA (12) Jonathan Demme
KAFKA (15) Steven Soderbergh
COOL RUNNINGS (PG)John Turteltaub
THE PELICAN BRIEF (12) Alan J. Pakula
Is it good to be gay? For Britain, the sight of Hollywood and the House of
Commons jumping on the same bandwagon in the same week must be the most
startling - and/or stirring - of modern times. Westminster gives us a new
age of consent. Tinseltown with Philadelphia gives us a new age of
moviegoing awareness. And even Uncle Oscar has clambered on the zeitgeist,
with a best actor nomination for the film's star Tom Hanks.
Hanks has this writer's vote. His believability as an Aids-ravaged,
job-dismissed lawyer gives shape and measure to the film's at times
flood-level sentimentalism. The first mainstream US movie ever to tackle
Aids, Philadelphia is directed by Jonathan Demme as if he had been abducted
by Gay Lib and forced to make amends for his Silence Of The Lambs. You
recall that brouhaha: film pilloried by agit-gays right up to Oscar time for
its picture of a (seemingly) homosexual serial killer.
Philadelphia takes a lawyer and crosses out 'seemingly.' Hanks's face
already shows the tell-tale blots of Kaposi's Sarcoma when a job superior
asks 'What's that on your forehead, pal?' Hanks mutters something about
squash balls, but we know better. He is losing weight; his gay friends are
offering make-up tips ('Tahitian bronze' to hide the lesions); and the film
is offering captions like 'Nine days later' to stress that this is ticking
time-bomb territory, where love and illness meet in a countdown to
apocalypse.
While half our brain hardens itself to the threat of hyperbole, the other
half senses something wonderful here. Ron Nyswaner's script plots the film
as a legal suspense story, using courtroom scenes to resolve Hanks's
unfair-dismissal suit against the firm that has soon pushed him off the
payroll and torn up partnership promises. This is just the populist approach
 -what filmgoer resists a trial? - to capture all those gay-rights-resistant
audiences in America's Bible belts or Britain's own bigotry zones.
Hanks's co-star Denzel Washington adds another twist to the plot. He is the
radical black lawyer who agrees to be Hanks's legal Galahad, even though the
one flaw in Mr W's liberalism is a tendency to homophobia. While we are
turning to mush during Hanks's big self-revelation scene - a surreally-lit
fantasia in which our tearful hero expounds the Maria Callas aria keening
from his CD-player while he 'dances' with his dripfeed stand - DW looks on
with a blend of cautious scepticism and heterosexual high anxiety. (By the
film's final fade, of course, he has resolved his problems and become as
mushy as the rest of us).
To have made this character a black was a touch of genius. It means that Mr
and Mrs Intolerant Filmgoer, if they want to make an anti-gay alliance with
one of the film's characters, must do so with a member of another 'minority'
they might not be on kissing terms with. Only alternative: to side with the
bigwig bigots (Jason Robards and Co) who spend the movie's second half
pinned to their attorney's table while the camera frisks them for guilty
reaction shots.
Philadelphia knows every trick and plays it. But it will still send all but
the stoniest cineastes sniffling from the theatre. Its heart is in the right
place and whatever else may be sorcery or special pleading, Hanks is the
real thing: no sentimental martyr but a messy, plausible collage of rage,
bewilderment, self-pity, resignation and gallows humour. That puckered baby
face, that elastic voice with the built-in shrugs, preside over a
convincingly wasted body: one from which Hanks shed 30 pounds for filming,
in acting's most heroic dietary crash-course since De Niro went the other
way in Raging Bull.
Philadelphia comes with a big, bold, bells-and-whistles subject. 'Ah, an
Aids movie]' - everyone can say it. But what is Kafka, the second film from
director Steven (sex, lies and videotape) Soderbergh, about? Limping into
London two years after it was made, this Prague-filmed fantasy about Franz K
(Jeremy Irons) and the Gothic adventures he might have had if he had been a
fictional character, chasing murderers, mutants and mad doctors, is like two
hours on a free-association couch in the 'K' section of the Great Literature
library.
Screenwriter Lem Dobbs must have said 'Kafka' to himself and then gone
berserk at his mental word-processor. He gives us vast clickety-click
offices; a pair of sinister twins; Theresa Russell as one of FK's
standard-issue teasing heroines; Alec Guinness and Ian Holm as assorted
authority figures; and a riot of cobbled streets, graveyards and beetling
castles. What we do not have is a plot, unless you count the jumble of
conspiracy shenanigans that climax somehow in a castle laboratory.
Soderbergh and Dobbs may feel they must pay their dues to German
Expressionism, but why should we pay to watch? We tire quickly - and a
perplexed-looking Irons looks as if he tired even more quickly - of the
in-joky names (Murnau, Orlok) and invocations of art gone-by.
Other choices this week are the non-pretentious Cool Runnings and the
somnolently zigzagging The Pelican Brief. The first is all about the
Jamaican bobsled team that made history when they competed at the 1988
Calgary winter Olympics. Four sun-black West Indians, played by actors whose
names seem to have fallen off a Scrabble board, parlay their home-town
sprinting and go-kart skills into the art of hurtling down snow chutes.
A film that might have been 'inspirational' proves 'inspired'. Debut
director John Turteltaub has a comic timing that Hollywood veterans might
envy, and the script rattles around like a crowded bobsled risking sharp
corners. Boldest touch of all was to cast fat and funny John Candy as the
team's trainer, an ex-Gold Medal winner, and then to fill him with a sour,
abrasive, worldweary wit worthy of Walter Matthau. A surprise; a delight.
Neither of those words suggests itself for The Pelican Brief. You remember
the twists and thrills in the John Grisham-based The Firm? Repeat here, with
diminished returns. Julia Roberts is the fledgeling lawyer who flies
straight into a Giant Conspiracy, beginning with the murder of two Supreme
Court justices. And the supporting characters are famous Hollywood names
pushed unceremoniously into the victim or villain lobby - Sam Shepard, John
Heard, Robert Culp - while the plot dashes through every picturesque
power-corridor it can find, ending up at the White House.
The only character you believe in is Denzel Washington as Miss JR's newsman
friend, flying out from Philadelphia to sketch in another sharp-nosed knight
errant. As for Roberts herself, I never felt I was watching a frightened
truth-seeker, more an actress drowning in too much plot. Alan J. Pakula, who
could direct films like this in his sleep (All The President's Men, The
Parallax View), seems to have done so here.
Finally, a brief hat-doffing to the success of these islands at the recent
Berlin Film Festival. The Golden Bear for best film placed its paw on In The
Name Of The Father. The Golden Bear for best actress hugged Crissy Rock in
Ken Loach's new Ladybird, Ladybird. (Mr Hanks got best actor for
Philadelphia). And Loach himself won the International Critics Prize for his
truth-based drama that for all its bureaucracy-walloping OTT tendencies -
multiple mother (Miss Rock) keeps losing babies to overzealous social
workers - had more energy than all the other films in Berlin put together.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Arts: A 1930s 'Boheme' - English Touring Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A touring opera company has a special duty to seek out new audiences. For
the past few years there has been a lively debate as to whether it is better
to present the operas to them in an up-to-date and obviously relevant style
or stay truthful to the composers' intentions - a dilemma to which English
Touring Opera seems to have found a good working compromise.
The new production for its spring season is La Boheme, which has just had
its opening performance at Sadler's Wells, London. This is commonly referred
to as a 'verismo' opera, though the term is hardly appropriate. Puccini may
pretend to be showing us life as it really was, but his picture of penniless
students sharing a garret in Paris one romantic Christmas in the 1830s is
highly idealised.
Producers today like to strip away the tinsel if possible and Thomas de
Mallet Burgess is no exception, though such a limited budget for the sets
(Martin Johns the designer) may have forced his hand. His Mimi and Rodolfo
are not trendily poor, beautiful people. Mimi is a plain girl, who wears
sensible shoes and has to put on glasses to look for her lost key. Her
chubby Rodolfo, in a drab brown jacket and striped pullover, dresses for
homely warmth, not to look the archetypal poet.
All this makes it easier for the central couple to touch the emotions.
Christine Bunning catches the awkwardness of shy Mimi, less convincingly her
fragility, and sings the music strongly with unfailing, sure tone. Geraint
Dodd is a husky-voiced Rodolfo lower down, brighter and easier at the top,
which is a bonus in a British tenor. They play sensitively together.
The dominant Bohemian is Adrian Clarke's Marcello, incisively sung, an
honest sort of fellow who can look a friend in the eye when the going gets
rough. Majella Cullagh matures into an appropriately serious-minded Musetta
for him by the end. Jonathan May's Colline and Meurig Davies's Schaunard
have to provide the fun, the latter with Hitler-esque moustache. Their
scenes together go nimbly under Martin Andre's lightweight direction.
The reference they make to Hitler is meant to have a point. The production
has shifted the period forward a century to the 1930s, though not for any
obvious reason. A lot of play is also made over the Parisian locale, with
army officers and gendarmes roaming the streets. Quite why a nun should drop
in for an evening of transvestite fun at the Cafe Momus I do not know, but
never mind. The production has given us believable people who could live
anytime, anywhere, and that is more important.
The same strength distinguishes the production of Donizetti's L'elisir
d'amore, with which the Puccini is playing in tandem. Sometimes one can go
months without seeing real people on an operatic stage. English Touring
Opera offers that particular pleasure twice over. It deserves good audiences
around the country.

We are promised Britt Ekland, Lulu, Adrian Edmondson, Helen Lederer, Jo
Brand and Zandra Rhodes all 'guesting' in Absolutely Fabulous. Can this
really be a good idea? The opening episode of this series packed in a
similar roster of star names, and turned out to be the least funny episode
of the lot (9.35 BBC1). A newer and more conventional comedy, Nelson's
Column, stars John Gordon Sinclair, the eternal juvenile lead from Gregory's
Girl, as a lovelorn (well, randy) local newspaper reporter (8.00 BBC1).
BBC2 begins a three-part series, In Search Of Our Ancestors, with
anthropologist Donald Johanson returning to Ethiopia to re-tell the story of
the 'missing link' (9.30 BBC2). Commando relies on the same exultation in
military macho that used to sell 'Battle' comics to schoolboys in the 1950s.
Tough chaps face fearful challenges and are driven to the limits of
endurance (9.30 ITV).
Will Late Picasso complete BBC2's Picasso season by facing up to the public
contempt for the Modern movement? (11.15 BBC2).

FT  24 FEB 94 / Arts: Eric Clapton - Pop music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it's February it must be Clapton at the Albert Hall. 'Old slow hand' has
returned for the eighth successive year for a string of dates which have
become as ritualistic as the Proms. The crowd stays the same - City types
who jog embarrassingly out of time with the music; the songs are
predictable, culminating in 'Layla', at which the committed believers rush
to the front to make a Mass of it; and the man is unchangeable, as ordinary
as his guitar playing is out of this world.
Yet there are always subtle differences. This year Clapton is pared down to
minimalist jeans and T-shirt, crew cut and glasses, to go with his current
pre-occupation with the blues. He begins unplugged, static, and solo on a
chair. Then as the blues roll the stage fills with musicians, obviously
professionals because they are weighed down in black suits.
Clapton indulges himself outrageously as he pours out the best of Elmore
James, Howlin' Wolf and the rest of the sad bunch of travelling men. A good
blues, like 'Hoochie coochie man', hits the spot, but there comes a point
when you cannot take any more misery. Clapton tests the loyalty of his fans
before relieving the gloom by bringing on the girls and the brass and
letting go with 'White Room'. This is what the audience expected and lays
back, in its turn, to be indulged.
It was not to be; well, only fitfully. Clapton did go back to basics with an
intimate 'Tears in Heaven', which now seems less maudlin and more heart
felt, but then the blues got a grip again. In a way it matters little.
Clapton is in staggering form as a guitarist. Just as you can be tone deaf
and wonder at Stern on the violin or Horovitz on the piano, so Clapton's
genius is transparent as his guitar speaks the sad music.
There is a feeling that the Clapton concerts have become an event for those
chasing the place to be rather than for the fans who have kept the faith
since proclaiming Clapton as God in the 1960s. When he sings 'Wonderful
Tonight' just one couple of romantics held aloft their lighters aflame. By
his musical professionalism Eric Clapton has made the atmosphere at the
Albert Hall no different from that conjured up by the most acclaimed
classical maestro. It is a memorable experience, but it is not rock and
roll.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Brand new Birmingham
 -A city selling itself as a product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unveiling this week by the City of Birmingham of a new 'corporate'
identity raises the question: how much is a city like a company? Birmingham
City Council, which represents more citizens in one body than any other city
in Britain, is the latest to adopt a brand symbol as a focus for its
promotional activities.
'Birmingham is a product. It is capable of being 'branded', just as Cadbury
brands its chocolate products,' according to the Birmingham Marketing
Partnership, the organisation behind the new logo. But cities are not
chocolates; they have real and complex cultural identities.
Nevertheless, according to Adrian Day of Siegel and Gale, the consultants
responsible for the new symbol. 'The marketing of cities as brands is coming
to the fore.' In the past, a city council marketing director would earn far
less than a counterpart in industry, an indication of the traditional
amateurism of civic promotion. Now, commercial methods and salaries to match
are emerging. The phenomenon is especially noticeable in regional centres.
Behind the new promotional drive is Birmingham Marketing Partnership, a
coalition of public- and private-sector resources set up by the
Labour-controlled council last summer. 'Past efforts to market Birmingham
were very fragmented,' says Philip Calcutt, the partnership's marketing
director. 'We are trying to bring some coherence.' Most big businesses in
the Birmingham area support the new city brand, says Calcutt. The challenge
now is to persuade smaller companies to use it - and use it correctly.
The implementation of a new corporate identity for a company can be tightly
controlled in a way that is not possible with a city brand, and opinions
created by graphic designer Milton Glaser for the City of New York in 1976
was deliberately not protected. Anybody could use it - or misuse it. An
alternative is for imprimaturs of a country, region or city to be awarded by
accreditation to comparatively few traders who can be relied upon to use it
properly and thus enhance the brand.
Birmingham has chosen a middle course. It hoped to persuade many of the
small businesses at the unveiling at the International Convention Centre on
Tuesday to adopt the symbol in their advertising and literature. 'The
broader its application, the better,' says Calcutt. The symbol is to be
registered as a trade mark, however, and users will have to apply the usage
guidelines prepared by Siegel and Gale to ensure that it is displayed to
best effect.
Birmingham Marketing Partnership's future role will be to co-ordinate
projects originated by partners such as the National Exhibition Centre or
the West Midlands Development Agency. For example, travellers to Birmingham
for sports championships or exhibitions receive 'VIP passports' entitling
them to offers in restaurants and facilities. Such a scheme appears simple,
but requires co-ordination.
The architecture of the National Exhibition Centre, the International
Conference Centre and Symphony Hall may not compare with the splendours of,
say, Barcelona or Lyon - two other 'second' cities which have a brand
symbol. But Birmingham Marketing Partnership and Siegel and Gale agree that
without the cultural and commercial qualities of Birmingham, the creation of
the brand would have been a waste of time. 'They realised they had the
product; now they've got the expression of it,' says Day.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Gambling on a
gut-feeling - Why spending substantial amounts on advertising is not always
easy to justify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peperami is a bit of an animal, but it has not always been that way. It
started as a rather sad salami stick with sluggish sales; by 1989 the savory
snack had almost died completely, when it was withdrawn in its old
formulation because of a salmonella scare.
Then, last year, advertising agency Still Price Lintas produced a Pounds 2m
advertising campaign for Peperami's manufacturer, Unilever subsidiary Van
den Bergh Foods. An animated Peperami popped up on UK TV screens, together
with the catchphrase: 'It's a bit of an animal.' Which bit was not
specified, but the character got the attention of audiences, particularly
the young males at which the manufacturers were aiming the product.
The advertisements were followed by a 35 per cent cent increase in the
volume of sales, and in 1993 the retail value of the brand reached Pounds
22.5m in the UK. A second set of ads, featuring the same animated salami on
legs, is due to start in just over a week.
Justifying the expense of a second advertising campaign will hardly have
been difficult for Simon Turner, Van den Bergh's marketing director. He
estimates that the first campaign accounted for at least a 25 per cent
increase in sales; the other 10 per cent would have come from changes in
distribution and the way the product was displayed.
But for other marketers, who are only too aware of the way finance directors
tend to lop budgets during a recession, it is not always so straightforward
to develop a convincing case for spending money on advertising. Evaluating
its effectiveness is not always easy and there are still clients, as well as
agencies, who rely on instinct and a prayer.
Says Janet Hull, director of advertising effectiveness at the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising: 'All of us know cases where gut-feel has
ruled.' The IPA is planning an education campaign intended to increase the
agencies' and clients' sophistication in this area.
Hull emphasises that it is vital to establish what is being measured from
the outset. For example, the advertising of a new product would be expected
to lead to a sharp increase in trial by consumers; for a well-established
brand, the aim might be to bring it up to date or broaden its reach; for a
mature brand, success might be limited to slowing the rate of decline.
An illustration of how advertising can add value to a new product is
provided by the campaign surrounding the launch of the Volkswagen Golf Mark
II in 1984. The usual cycle of car launches is that a new model - unless it
is truly innovative - has an advantage in the market for, at most, about
three years and is then superseded by another maker's new model.
Volkswagen's aim with the Golf Mark II was to use advertising to extend this
initial advantage beyond the three-year mark. It had to do this without the
bonus of the new car being particularly innovative - indeed, the motoring
press expressed disappointment that the new model was so conservative.
Following two highly-acclaimed ads by agency BMP DDB Needham, which ran in
eight bursts on television between 1985 and 1989, market share did, indeed,
carry on increasing for six years, dipping in the seventh because of supply
problems. The ads, explains BMP DDB Needham, were centred on the driver of
the car, rather than the car itself, 'breaking the product-focused rules of
the market'.
According to VW, an advertising outlay of Pounds 10.9m during 1985-89
produced extra sales of nearly 37,000 cars and additional gross profit of
about Pounds 30m. Research confirms that these extra sales did not result
from lower prices, lack of competition or improved distribution.
The case for the part advertising had to play in the sustained sales of the
car was set out in 1992 in a prize-winning submission for the biennial
advertising effectiveness awards, which are run by the IPA, though largely
judged by representatives of industry. The closing date for this year's
awards is June 1 - Van den Bergh and Still Price Lintas plan to enter
Peperami.
The overall winner of the 1992 awards was another campaign by BMP DDB
Needham, this time for the National Diary Council which was trying to slow
down the sharp decline in demand for doorstep deliveries of milk. The
success of the campaign demonstrated the potential effectiveness of
advertising when a mature market finds itself under pressure.
In 1980, nearly 90 per cent of households had milk delivered; just 10 years
later, social and demographic changes, but most of all, fierce price
competition from supermarkets, forced the figure down to 69 per cent. Milk
deliveries were losing 1m customers a year and it was estimated that, if the
trend continued, there would be nothing left of the market within 12 years.
The advertising agency rejected the idea of trying to recruit new customers
and concentrated instead on those who were on the brink of cancelling
deliveries. The beginning of the slippery slope towards cancellation was
found to be the point when consumers started to buy some of their milk,
perhaps at the weekend, from the supermarket. These consumers were targeted
with TV ads which focused on the convenience of having milk delivered,
rather than carting it home.
From January 1990 to April 1991, the milkman's share of the market declined
at an average of 0.43 per cent share points per months; from May to December
1991, which coincided with the advertising campaign, there was a decline of
just 0.01 percentage points. It was established that no other factors were
behind the stabilisation in sales.
The judges of the effectiveness awards concluded: 'Whatever the future for
home delivery, the advertising monies spent to date by the industry have
been paid back handsomely.' As Hull points out, marketing directors armed
with this proof - only possible to provide when measures of effectiveness
are built in to a campaign - will be the best-equipped to fend off the
finance director when times are tough.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Good ad for the
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the beleaguered advertising agency, can take some comfort
from figures due to be published tomorrow in Campaign, the advertising
industry journal.
Saatchi has lengthened its lead over all other UK agencies, with a 16 per
cent increase in billings for 1993. This appears to have been achieved at
the same time as a 3 per cent cut in staffing.
Unfortunately this performance is not matched by the agency in the US, where
Charles Scott, chief executive of the group, is wrestling with the structure
and attempting to attract new business. Just days ago it was disclosed that
Bob Kennedy, the former US Saatchi chief, had received a Pounds 4m pay-off
after just a year in the job.
Overall, the Campaign figures show significantly higher billings for the top
UK agencies, reflecting, says the journal, advertisers' growing confidence
in the economic recovery. The increase, as measured by the Register-Meal
tracking group, was 11 per cent during the year.
In second place, behind Saatchi's Pounds 264m of billings, comes Ogilvy and
Mather, part of the WPP group, with a 6 per cent increase to Pounds 197m. J
Walter Thompson, also part of WPP, slipped this year from second to third
place in the billings league, with Pounds 185m - a 5 per cent drop on 1992.
Abbott Mead Vickers climbed from eighth to fourth position, with a 28 per
cent increase to Pounds 180m.
Other strong performances during the year were from Kevin Morley Group (up
51 per cent); Butterfield Day Devito Hockney (up 75 per cent); and Howell
Henry Chaldecott Lury (up 72 per cent).
Saatchi was not the only agency to achieve a productivity increase last
year: across the top 30 agencies, productivity increased by 15 per cent from
billings per head of Pounds 520,000 in 1992 to Pounds 597,000 last year.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Why a buoyant US and Asia pity poor old
listless Europe - The view from outside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS, MARTIN DICKSON and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's flagging prowess prompts surprise, criticism and - worst of all -
pity from business leaders in the US and Asia. Many American executives,
basking in their country's economic revival, are scathing about the Old
World's inability to find the path back to growth.
Although corporate Japan is preoccupied by the country's own recession, its
representatives wonder aloud about Europe's capacity to solve its problems.
Elsewhere, in east Asia's booming 'tiger' economies, industrialists say
bluntly that Europe will slip further in the competitiveness league unless
it adopts more free market medicine.
Many US executives attribute their country's economic recovery to the
creative energy of American capitalism. They view Europe, by contrast, as a
soft, sclerotic society, addicted to subsidies, welfare handouts and long
holidays.
'Painful as it must be, Europe needs to celebrate change,' says Mr Tom
Theobald, chairman of Continental Bank. 'Some wonderful cultural and
societal values are bottled up in European tradition, but the communication
and transportation revolution no longers allows the continent to be walled
off from world competititors. Change is frightening, even in America, but
Europe must master the art.'
Americans acknowledge that, in sectors such as power generation equipment,
chemicals and retailing, Europe remains competitive. However, Europe is
regarded as lagging badly in many important high technology industries,
including computer hardware and software, data networking, and multi-media
telephony and entertainment.
One top executive at a leading US electronics group says most American
companies know relatively little about European companies because so few of
them are good enough to set standards in their individual sectors. European
volume motor manufacturers, for years protected from Japanese competition,
are regarded as well behind the European operations of Ford and General
Motors in productivity and cost-cutting.
Americans point to recent decisions by Germany's BMW and Mercedes-Benz to
locate new factories in the southern US. This shows, they say, how European
industry is trying to escape high domestic costs by moving abroad.
Japanese executives these days pay less attention to Europe, reflecting a
shift in Japan's investment priorities to China and other parts of Asia.
Additionally, BMW's surprise move to buy 80 per cent of Rover, the UK motor
company in which Honda holds a 20 per cent stake, has reminded Japanese
businessmen of the differences in corporate culture between Europe and Asia.
Mr Toyoo Gyoten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo, says Europe faces 'multiple
challenges' as a result of 'dangerously high' unemployment and post-cold war
uncertainties. Mr Gyoten says an important priority is 'to complete the
reunification of Germany as soon as possible'.
'United Germany is bound to play the role of an anchor in the economic and
political stability of Europe. However, it didn't take much time for our
German friends to discover that the task of unification was indeed a
daunting one.'
Mr Gyoten adds that the collapse of the European Monetary System has
'maimed' momentum towards economic integration. Europe will remain a
federation of nation states, he says. 'Convergence of economic fundamentals
must come first before artificial institutionalisation (of European union.)'
The most outspoken advocacy of free market solutions comes from South Korea.
Mr Bae Soonhoon, president of Daewoo Electronics, says: 'The solution to the
European malaise is simple: give Adam Smith as much chance to work as
possible. Remove the paternalistic protection given to industry and workers,
which in many cases is neither wanted or needed.
'Europeans must recognise that today's comforts have been made possible by
the industriousness of their forefathers, and the value of hard work must be
relearned from them.'
Mr SaKong Il, a former South Korean finance minister and president of the
Institute for Global Economics in Seoul, says Europe has lost its sense of
priorities. 'It has been devoting too much time and energy to political
integration. It has not paid enough attention to unemployment and other
social problems. These are now the issues - and they cannot be remedied by
quick-fix solutions.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Sunderland's torch of hope - or is it a
flare of doom? - Case study, Nissan / When competition bites, Europeans can
adjust their attitudes. Management at Nissan's UK car plant aims to outdo
the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For optimists seeking signs of revival in run-down north-east England, the
Nissan motor company's car factory on the outskirts of Sunderland symbolises
Britain's new manufacturing prowess. For rivals like Peugeot or Ford of
Europe, the Nissan plant is an instrument of Japanese power, brought into
the bastion of the European Union to undermine the continent's indigenous
car companies. Whatever the ultimate verdict on Nissan's Pounds 900m
Sunderland plant, it potently illustrates the mood of change and challenge
sweeping Europe.
The precepts put into effect at Nissan demonstrate that, when competition
bites, European managers and workers can radically adjust practices and
attitudes. In an increasingly integrated world, foreign ownership is no bar
to economic accomplishment. Nissan last year was Britain's biggest motor
exporter, selling abroad 75 per cent of output.
Clad in a bright blue production uniform, Mr Ian Gibson, 47, managing
director of Nissan's UK operations, joined the company in 1984 after 16
years with Ford in Britain and Germany.
Expounding how the UK must learn from Germany and Japan - 'the two great
manufacturing nations' - he says the watchwords of the roughly 4,000-strong
workforce are flexibility, perfectionism and determination.
The plant came on stream in 1986. It was the right moment to benefit from
labour market deregulation in Thatcherite Britain and the country's
late-1980s economic boom. Japanese capital, technology and work methods,
twinned with British pragmatism and a brand new greenfield site, proved a
winning combination.
'We were a pilot enterprise,' says Mr Gibson. 'We had no existing
bureaucracy or (corporate) culture to change.' Now, he says, productivity
equals that of comparably-sized Japanese plants.
Lean production, by definition, cannot provide jobs for tens of thousands.
The company hires for its production teams - average age 23 or 24 - only
those who show Nissan-style commitment.
Furthermore, Nissan is now showing it is as vulnerable to the economic cycle
as General Motors or Volkswagen.
Nissan is cutting about 600 jobs through voluntary redundancies, introduced
to adapt production to reduced 1993-94 European car demand. This year's
output will be between 200,000 and 220,000 Primera and Micra cars, compared
with 246,000 last year.
Sunderland's unemployment rate, meanwhile, is 13 per cent. When Nissan
launched its last recruitment drive, two years ago, 32,000 people applied
for 1,600 jobs.
Sunderland's dire employment picture adds point to Mr Gibson's view that
there are no short cuts along the gritty road to success.
He takes pride in the plant's efforts to exceed Japanese quality standards.
'Our biggest competitor is not Ford or Renault. It is Nissan Japan.'
Pointing to Sunderland's links with European component suppliers, as well as
engineers and designers at Nissan research facilities in the UK and on the
European mainland, he plays down the influence of its Japanese parent.
'We have been given no magic gift, no secret passport. We have assembled a
collection of best practices where the most important questions are not
technical or mechanical, but broader management issues: how to organise
people and things so that manufacturing runs well . . . People's approach
and attitude are more important than technical skills.'
In the crucial question of new car development, Mr Gibson even sees room for
self-sufficiency. 'If our team of British and European engineers and
suppliers was to leave the company tomorrow, we couldn't build a new car. If
the Japanese left, it would take 18 months longer - but we could do it.'
Brave words, posing a question than only the brave can answer: could
north-east England's dark industrial fields one day raise a Japanese
manufacturing culture, without the Japanese?

FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A relapse into Eurosclerosis - The
European Union needs deregulation and radical public sector reform to avoid
becoming an economic backwater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade ago, Europe was afflicted by a fevered debate on its poor economic
performance. The policy doctors decided the correct diagnosis was
'Eurosclerosis'; their cure was completion of the single market, an idea
subsequently incorporated into the Single European Act of 1987. For a time
that remedy seemed effective. In the event, however, completion of the
single market at the end of 1992 coincided with another recession and
another bout of Europessimism.
This time, the European Union has devised the white paper on growth,
competitiveness and employment put forward by the president of the
Commission, Jacques Delors, last December. By previous standards, it is a
modest document. It eschews Brussels-led legislation in favour of a menu of
recommendations for macro-economic stability, modest spending on
infrastructure and small dollops of labour market deregulation.
In the title of the white paper, 'competitiveness' is inserted between
'growth' and 'employment'. This is a little misleading. Overall, an economy
performs, either well or badly: the notion of competitiveness is most
relevant to sectors that are exposed to the international market,
particularly manufactures.
Start then with aggregate performance. Until recently, the Japanese economy
grew far faster than those of the US and the EU, whose growth was similar
(see chart). By contrast, the overall employment and labour productivity
performances of the US and EU presented mirror images of each other: between
1980 and 1992, employment grew by 18 per cent in the US, while labour
productivity rose 12 per cent; meanwhile, employment in the EU grew by only
6 per cent, but labour productivity rose by 22 per cent. The EU's superior
productivity growth was wasteful, however, since it coincided with rising
unemployment.
The employment record of EU manufacturing is much the same as that of the
US, both showing steep absolute declines. Thus the EU's jobs failure results
from relatively poor employment generation in the more sheltered service
activities. The central role of services in employment is inescapable, since
by 1990 71 per cent of civilian employment in the US was generated by
services, up from 56 per cent in 1960, while the proportion in the EU was 61
per cent, up from 39 per cent in 1960.
Within advanced economies developments in manufacturing have long had
negative effects on employment, for two reasons: the volume of manufactured
output has tended to rise no more rapidly than output as a whole;
manufacturing also offers exceptionally favourable opportunities for
increases in labour productivity.
The EU's chief overall failure has, in short, been its inability to create
jobs. Economies with greater labour flexibility, such as the US, have
generated more service sector jobs, many of them part time and many of them
taken by women.
Turn next to international competitiveness. Some three-quarters of the total
merchandise exports of EU member states consists of manufactures. World
trade in commercial services was only Dollars 1,000bn in 1992, as against
Dollars 3,640bn of merchandise trade, of which Dollars 2,650bn was in
manufactures. Manufacturing activities are, therefore, much the most exposed
to the forces of international competition.
The output of US manufactures between 1980 and 1992 rose twice as much as
that of the EU, while Japan's rose far more. Output per person in EU
manufacturing also rose less than in the US and Japan. This does not reflect
an even performance throughout the EU. Between 1980 and 1989, according to
the OECD, manufactured output per person rose only 15 per cent in West
Germany and 29 per cent in France, but by 47 per cent in Italy and more than
50 per cent in the UK.
Meanwhile, the share of EU external manufactured exports in world exports
shrank from 21.9 per cent in 1980 to 19.4 per cent in 1986 and then 17.6 per
cent in 1992. The EU has also become more inward-looking: between 1986 and
1992, the share of its members' exports going to one another rose from 54.1
to 59.7 per cent.
One explanation for the poor performance of manufacturing exports must be
the EU's relative emphasis on internal rather than external liberalisation.
The EU has, in effect, been pursuing an import-substitution strategy, one
favouring internal sales over exports.
A second explanation would be a mixture of inadequate innovation with an
unfavourable industrial structure.
Magnus Blomstrom, a Swedish economist, notes that in 1987 the research and
development intensity of US exports of manufactures to the EU was almost
twice as high as in its imports from the EU. He also labels 51 per cent of
US exports of manufactures to the EU in that year 'high technology', 29 per
cent 'medium technology' and just 20 per cent 'low technology'. By contrast,
he found that 23 per cent of the EU's exports to the US were high
technology, 44 per cent were medium technology and 33 per cent were low
technology.
By specialising in goods that lack dynamic world markets or technological
sophistication, European industry would be increasingly exposed to
competition based on price. EU production is, in fact, already subject to
growing competition from East Asian exporters of labour-intensive, medium-
and low-technology manufactures. Thus, between 1981 and 1991 the volume of
exports from east Asian developing countries, mainly of manufactures, grew
at 10.3 per cent a year, while the EU's grew at only 4.1 per cent. Their
pressure can only increase.
An American economist, Larry Franko, has shown that between 1980 and 1990
the share of large EU companies improved modestly relative to their peers in
the other big advanced economies in production of chemicals, consumer goods,
pharmaceuticals and petroleum products. Of these, only pharmaceuticals has
been a particularly dynamic industry. By contrast, European companies barely
maintained their position in motor vehicles, electrical equipment and
electronics, despite protection of the European market. Worse, their share
of the world's 12 largest companies' output remained stuck at a negligible 7
per cent in computers and office equipment, the most dynamic of all
manufacturing industries.
A third explanation for both poor export performance and slow growth of
output is the high level and adverse development of EU costs.
According to figures from Morgan Stanley and DRI McGraw-Hill, 1993 labour
costs per hour in the EU's most important economy, west Germany, were some
50 per cent higher than those of the US and Japan. Even labour costs per
hour in east Germany were higher than in the US and Japan, while those of
France were close to US and Japanese levels. Yet OECD statistics suggest
that productivity per hour in US manufacturing is still about a third higher
than in the most advanced economies of continental Europe.
In addition, leading European currencies have experienced substantial real
appreciations vis a vis the US dollar since the early 1970s. The US dollar's
appreciation between 1979 and 1985 was but a blip in this trend. Other
European currencies have suffered the same fate as the D-Mark, particularly
the pound sterling, whose real appreciation since 1970 has been the biggest
of the major European currencies.
The last major issue is whether there is a link between the EU's poor
overall employment generation, on the one hand, and the weak performance of
manufacturing, the sector most exposed to global competition, on the other.
There is: high labour costs. If domestic costs are pushed progressively
above market-clearing levels, employment will shrink, or at least not rise
as fast as could be hoped, since capital will be substituted for labour. In
addition, the industries most exposed to international competition should
lag behind the rest of the economy, as profits are squeezed. Both have
happened in the EU.
Between 1980 and 1992 US average real wages (before direct taxes) fell by
about 8 per cent. Over the same period, however, British real wages rose by
36 per cent, German by 22 per cent, Italian by 14 per cent and French by 13
per cent. It is easy to see why Americans voted for a candidate who promised
them more 'good jobs'. Yet it is also easy to see why the EU has generated
few jobs and its internationally competing industries have struggled.
Three explanations might be advanced for the EU's high and rising labour
costs in the presence of growing unemployment: first, inadequate
competition, particularly for the output of its service industries; second,
legislation intended to give security to workers, which reduces the
competitive pressure from outsiders on insiders; finally, the relatively
high burden of taxation and particularly of direct charges on labour, which
European workers have been unwilling to absorb in their take home pay.
The solution to the twin problems of poor employment creation and inadequate
competitiveness lies in greater competition, labour market deregulation and
radical reform of the public sector. If such changes are ruled out as
politically unrealistic, reality will have its revenge. Eurosclerosis will
become permanent and the European Union eventually a backwater in the global
economy.

What the industrialists think
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
CARLO DE BENEDETTI
Chairman of Italy's Olivetti computer group
'European politicians must make greater efforts to understand where
the world is going, rather than just concentrate on their own little
gardens. They must recognise the importance of China. They must see
that the upturn in many American industries has come not just because
of cyclical recovery, but because of deeper structural changes.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
SIR DENYS HENDERSON
Chairman of Britain's ICI/Zeneca chemicals &amp; pharmaceuticals group
'A general problem is the excess of regulations stultifying industry.
If we cannot fight our corner with the US and competitors in the Far
East, Europe will be in severe trouble. There has been a steep change
recently among companies in continental Europe. They realise they are
not competitive when social charges add 80 to 90 per cent to wage
costs.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
TYLL NECKER
Chairman of Hako-Werke &amp; president of Federation of German Industry
'Everywhere - particularly in France and Germany - the public sector's
share of the economy is too high. We need further support for
innovation: in some fields, such as genetic engineering in Germany,
there are still far too many hindrances. We also need to do more in the
field of education and a general overhaul of social security systems is
what is required.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
EBERHARD VON KOERBER
Chairman of European side of Swiss-Swedish ABB engineering group
'We will all have to go through a severe crisis - not so much in the
UK, more in places like Spain and Germany. Even with improved
economic growth, we will experience higher structural unemployment
throughout Europe. Without this pressure of pain, Europe will not react
in the correct way. The structural crisis we are facing is in fact a
unique opportunity.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOEL GOUTARD
Chairman of French motor components maker Valeo
'We need to cut interest rates. The French franc's attachment to the
D-Mark has caused horrible unemployment. I do not see any usefulness
in the idea of monetary union, which is anyway utopian. Europe has to
face up to an increasingly hispanic North America, and from countries
like China and India that now have freed their reserves of
expression and imagination.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: An elusive corporate consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European economies are becoming more integrated, but European business
leaders remain a highly diverse breed. Today's continent-wide opinion poll
for the FT and five other European newspapers shows marked differences in
attitudes to the continent's economic challenges.
The continent seems to divide along north-south lines. Executives in the UK,
Germany and the Netherlands generally favour free-market solutions to
Europe's competitiveness difficulties, while those in France and Spain lean
towards solutions involving government action - including a sharpening of
protection against imports.
The northern countries - above all, Britain and Germany - are more doubtful
about possibilities for economic and monetary union and about the benefits
of the European single market. The larger companies surveyed view monetary
union with most scepticism.
On the basic question of whether Europe will remain competitive during the
next 10 years, the Dutch, Belgians and British have the lowest expectations,
with 50 per cent, 45 per cent and 42 per cent respectively saying they
believe Europe will slip behind. There is a general consensus that the
countries posing the main competitive problems are the 'tiger' economies in
east Asia. For the UK and France, China is seen as a much greater long-term
economic threat than the US or Japan. Among British executives, for
instance, 54 per cent say China is the 'greatest threat', while only 24 per
cent and 12 per cent hold this view of Japan and the US respectively.
Countries closer to the nascent market economies of eastern Europe take a
more serious view of competition from this region. German, Belgian and Dutch
business leaders see eastern Europe as a graver challenge than China, Japan
or the US.
Forty-three per cent of Belgian respondents see eastern Europe as a serious
threat, with 40 per cent of those in the Netherlands and 26 per cent in
Germany taking this view.
German and British companies are considered most likely to succeed in
cutting production costs and increasing competitiveness during the next five
years. Spain and France are generally expected to fare less well.
However, underlying doubts about the German economy are highlighted by a
significant minority of respondents - 23 per cent - who believe Germany will
achieve the least success in cost-pruning.
Forty-one per cent of respondents believe Germany will fare best at reducing
costs, with this view most widely held among German, Spanish and Dutch
executives.
The UK is regarded as the next most successful cost-cutter, with 21 per cent
of executives supporting this view.
German, Belgian and Spanish participants are most confident that Europe's
worst recession since 1975 will give way to modest economic recovery this
year - a view held by 78 per cent, 76 per cent and 71 per cent respectively
in the three countries.
Even the relative optimists, however, mainly believe that this year's growth
in EU countries will be below 1 per cent.
In line with diminished growth prospects, 45 per cent of respondents say
they will reduce their workforces this year, with only 10 per cent expecting
an increase and 44 per cent intending to keep staff unchanged. Fifty two per
cent of manufacturing companies plan job cuts, while the proportion in
service industries is only 33 per cent. The proportion of companies planning
to reduce staff is highest in Germany (55 per cent), the Netherlands (50 per
cent) and Belgium (48 per cent).
There are large differences on one of the most emotive questions in the poll
 -possible trade barriers against eastern Europe and Asia. Twenty-six per
cent of French respondents favour higher trade barriers against imports,
with only 17 per cent saying existing barriers should be lowered. But, in
Britain and Germany, only 4 and 5 per cent want higher barriers, while 69
per cent and 62 per cent want to lower them. No Dutch industrialists
surveyed favoured raising barriers, with 71 per cent saying they should be
lowered.
Executives' commonly lack detailed knowledge of the Delors white paper on
growth and competitiveness. Only 22 per cent say they are familiar with it;
of these, 70 per cent say it is 'fairly good' or 'very good'. Reaction is
most positive in Germany, Italy and Spain, but more scep-tical in Britain
and France.
Business leaders display disappointment with the fading quality of national
political leadership , as well as a lack of enthusiasm for EU institutions.
Forty-one per cent say the quality of political leaders has deteriorated
during the past 15 years, while 36 per cent say it has improved. In a solid
vote against Chancellor Helmut Kohl, opinion is most negative in Germany,
where 68 per cent say leadership has declined since the 1970s.
Nearly half of respondents say they do not know who they would like as the
new president of the Commission next year. Buoyed by support from business
leaders in their own countries, Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of
the Commission - who has said he does not want to stand again - and Mr Ruud
Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, lead the poll, each with 9 per cent
support.
Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner for external economic relations, comes
next with 8 per cent. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is favoured by an
overall 2 per cent of respondents - but only one per cent of executives in
his own country believe he would be right for the job.
CAN EUROPE COMPETE?
This is the first instalment of a special 10-part FT series examining
Europe's response to intensifying world-wide competition. Subsequent
articles, appearing every weekday for the next fortnight, will look at:
Manufacturing. How good are European workers and managers?
The Labour Market. Why is Europe suffering from chronic unemployment and
sluggish job creation?
Service Industries. Can services create the jobs lost in manfacturing?
Technology and Innovation. Is Europe being left behind in the global race
for technological advantage?
The Environment. Are green rules a burden or boon?
Financial markets. Is Europe a world-beater in financial services?
The European market. How complete is the single market? And what role can
eastern Europe play?
Grey Europe. Europe's population is ageing. What will this mean for
business, the economy and the role of the state?
The Cure. How companies, governments and employees can meet the challenge.
WHERE EUROPE IS HEADING - THE VIEW FROM THE BOARDROOM
The poll, commissioned by the FT in association with Die Zeit (Germany), Les
Echos (France), Il Sole 24 Ore (Italy),  Expansion (Spain) and Het
Financieele Dagblad (Netherlands), was carried out by Harris Research. It is
based on telephone interviews carried out between January 6 and February 6
with directors of 507 top companies in seven European countries, of which
331 are manufacturing and 176 service companies. The survey sample, drawn
from Europe's top 15,000 companies ranked by turnover, was split among the
following countries: Belgium (42), France (86), Germany (85), Italy (84),
Netherlands (42), Spain (84), UK (84).

FT  24 FEB 94 / People: WDA selects Hartop for top job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chief executive of the Welsh Development Agency is to be Barry
Hartop, an Englishman who resigned as managing director of Gestetner Office
Systems Division when the company issued a profits warning in 1991.
He replaces Philip Head, who resigned last October after the publication of
a scathing report on the WDA by the Commons public accounts committee. Head,
who stayed in place until this month while a successor was found, has become
head of property services at the Further Education Funding Council in
England.
Hartop, who is 51, will take up the post on March 7. He has the job of
implementing the agency's new slimmer structure, announced by David
Rowe-Beddoe, the chairman, in January. The agency is being revamped into
three regional divisions plus the international division, with a target date
for completion of October. In the meantime, about 70 of the agency's 420
jobs will be lost.
'Wales's success in attracting inward investment is second to none,' Hartop
says. 'I want to ensure that not only is the WDA well placed to build on and
continue this success, but also that it focuses on stimulating indigenous
business growth.'
Hartop became Gestetner's managing director in 1989, after 24 years with
Unilever. From 1983 until he joined Gestetner, he was chairman and managing
director of Lever Industrial. He has worked as a consultant with City
venture capital funds since 1962.
According to Rowe-Beddoe, who appointed Hartop with the approval of John
Redwood, Welsh secretary: 'Barry Hartop brings a wealth of management
expertise, gleaned in world-class organisations.'

If so many management textbooks stress how important customers are, why do
so few companies take any notice?
British Airways' previous regime mirrored businesses across the country -
customers were all that stopped the real work getting done. Turning this
around has been an impressive achievement for Charles Weiser.
The software has only been a small part of this success. While the system is
good, it still has a number of rough edges. It does not use the full power
of graphical user interface
provided by IBM's OS/2. The workstations all run a terminal emulator that
mimics an old-fashioned screen. Faxes and letters are displayed on a second
screen.
In many ways, it appears clumsy in use. If operators wishes to pan the
second screen or zoom in on a particular area, they have to look at the
first and type on the keyboard. While it is not an issue at present, worries
over repetitive strain injury should make BA look at the ergonomic issues
soon.
The system integrates reasonably well with external BA database systems and
the customer liaison staff have more access to BA systems than many
managers. The current methods might be helped by more sophisticated software
but at least the current system works.
I liked the idea that staff could measure their own performance using
Caress.
They can compare their workload with that of their peers and look at how
well they are achieving agreed targets. Likewise, managers can see which
members of their team do less well and then develop tailored training
packages for them.
As ever, the human management story overshadows the technology. The system
succeeds because of Weiser's skills rather than because of any technical
wizardry.
The study shows that success is produced by managers, not just technology.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Technology: A caress for the customer - Software at Work /
British Airways is using a 'workflow' computer system to respond to
complaints. Claire Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of
software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The airline once pilloried for misusing computers to filch customers has
changed its ways with the help of a new system to handle complaints.
'Caress' is a good name for the new British Airways system. Every employee
in customer relations who logs on to the computer, ready for a day of
reading angry letters and creating mollifying replies, is reminded of the
strong business philosophy of customer loyalty.
There was a time when an apposite name for the complaints system might have
been 'Tough]', but that was before the arrival of Charles Weiser, appointed
as head of the customer relations department in 1992. Weiser introduced the
idea of customer loyalty to the department. Up to then his career at BA had
been spent in implementing ideas to woo and keep customers.
Experience with BA's Executive Club, Air Miles and the Frequent Flyer
programmes had given Weiser a grasp of what mattered to whom. 'BA's
customers are quality conscious, vocal and demanding in their views - highly
diverse, not necessarily UK-based, but with the common thread that they
demand quality,' he says.
When Weiser arrived at customer relations, staff were accustomed to a
defensive approach to the job. Callers were told to put complaints in
writing. Letters could take weeks to answer and replies were often delayed
by exhaustive inquiries about what went wrong and whether or not the company
was bound to compensate.
The approach was summed up by Weiser as investigate, adjudicate, and then
compensate. 'We used to spend more on lawyers' fees than we did on
compensation to our Executive Club members,' says Weiser. 'There were 13
steps to any inquiry, and it took until step 10 to reply to the customer.'
Ranks of filing cabinets stored letters by the class of complainant
(corporate, personal), and then by case number.
The filing system made it impossible to link cases and often resulted in a
paper-chase around the office, with one person looking for a particular
file, unaware that someone else might be handling another aspect of the
investigation.
Weiser's rule book is a lot thinner than BAs' two-inch tome on what
circumstances merit compensation, and to what degree. A complaint, he
believes, indicates a customer who cares enough to write or telephone, and
offers BA an opportunity to impress. His aim is to put the problem right, to
impress the complainant with the speed and quality of response and, most
importantly, to retain that person's good opinion and future custom.
It costs five times as much to find a new customer as it does to keep an
existing one, is a rule hallowed by retail and services companies, and never
far from Weiser's mind. 'Somebody will tell a story about a bad experience
to 10 or so different people. They will tell a further nine about a good
response: that's going a long way to create the right impression.'
Weiser's starting point is to work out how much a customer is worth 'in
lifetime value' to the company in future custom; incoming complaints are
ranked accordingly. Continuity of case-handling was impossible with the old,
defensive system.
It was, in any case, time for a computer update. No existing system on the
market at the time embodied the new philosophy to Weiser's satisfaction. He
wanted a system that would make it possible to respond swiftly, personalised
to the degree that the complainant was not only given a proper answer, but
in such a way that he or she was made to feel 'listened to' and even
special.
The department went through a process recognised elsewhere as 'change
management' or business process re-engineering. It took a year to change the
fundamental attitude, according to Weiser. 'Now we ask, 'what can we do to
keep this customer with us?' An apology, a refund, a bouquet of flowers? It
might even be a full refund. What people want is an apology, quickly, not in
two or three months, and an assurance that it won't happen again.'
Any system that could deliver this speedy, sympathetic service had to deal
with a vast mailbag: an average of 400 letters a day, accompanied by various
pieces of 'evidence' such as cheques or items of cutlery. It needed links,
not only between the various service teams in the department, but to other
parts of BA. Each complaint has to be followed through with thorough
investigation and communication with the various departments accused of a
shortfall in service.
Cutting down on re-keying, and providing these links was an essential part
of the system that evolved. IBM suggested a long-term business partner,
Space Computer Systems, to undertake a bespoke system for BA, running on an
IBM AS400. It provides each workstation with a pair of screens, one
displaying the letter, another for tracking the workflow, creating the
reply, checking the 'audit trail' of who had done what about a particular
complaint. 'Our approach,' explains Vince Southcott of Space Computer
Systems, 'was to bring all the information to the workstation, automate the
key elements.'
The Caress system has access to other BA systems (booking, flight
information) from which information can be 'cut and pasted' into letters.
The daily input of letters and any accompaniments is scanned in, then
categorised by the duty supervisor as one of 23 types of complaint and for
urgency of reply. From that point, every process is tracked, with
supervisors checking the progress and case-load. The staff work in teams,
taking it in turns to answer the telephone calls that are now positively
encouraged.
There are weekly report meetings and formal channels of feedback between
customer services and the other areas such as catering, baggage handling,
and the various terminals. Customer relations are now on-site and are a
respected voice among other operations.
'If we have a problem, we can now analyse it,' says Helen Mann, systems
co-ordinator. She rates highly the 'feel-good factor' staff are now able to
deliver immediately, especially by telephone. 'Before, we had to look in the
book, but this system allows us to drill down into immense detail.'
Responses are not ready-made form letters, although there are strict rules
about the wording. Clare Todd, a team leader, is taking her turn at
correspondence, with 350 letters on the stack. 'There's a lot less
frustration, you can see what's going on, and we can spend a lot more time
both with the complainants, and with the team,' she says.
The 12-week backlog, and its paper-chase, have disappeared. As if on cue,
two men appear with barrows to wheel away the last remaining filing
cabinets. What is embodied in the system is not the rule book, but a
common-sense approach of 'own the customer, own the problem, own the
response'. But it is obvious that Weiser knows the rules in minute depth.
Only three customers in 1,000 complain. Only one in five is compensated, but
there is evidence - some of it on the noticeboard - that complainants deeply
appreciate the personal touch that the system has cultivated. 'The
satisfaction rate is enormous,' says Weiser, convinced that the system is
swiftly paying for itself. 'More than 60 to 70 per cent will fly BA again.'
BUZZWORDS
WORKFLOW is a term used to describe computer systems that track the progress
of a job or process from one person and activity to another. The structure
of the business process is built into the software. Document image
processing and electronic mail and 'groupware' (defining particular work and
message groups within the processes) are often a part of a workflow system.

FT  24 FEB 94 / People: UBS gets Carter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Chris Carter took the call from the headhunters looking for a new head
of global equity strategy for UBS, he says he thought long and hard before
even agreeing to an interview.
That was not just because the research division at the Swiss bank's London
investment arm had been in a state of some upheaval, but also because the
jump from what he describes as the 'relatively secure' world of fund
management, where he has spent his career, to that of stockbroking research,
is a big one.
'Fund managers are always critical of broker research material and if
anything the strategists get even more stick than the company analysts. So I
decided to take up the challenge of designing a product with which fund
managers could not find fault.'
Carter, 34, comes from Cigna International Investment Advisors, the
international arm of the fund management operation of the US insurance
giant. There he had been head of international equities for a group with
Dollars 6bn under management. Before 1991 he had spent nine years with Bank
of America Investment Management and then World Invest, the management
buy-out of the BoA operation.
He replaces Guy Rigden who is currently writing a business plan for UBS's
push into the modish field of emerging markets preparatory to heading up the
equity emerging markets division.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Hayter, who has turned his hand to a broad range of information
technology-related consultancy work since he left the London Stock Exchange
in 1990, has become a non-exec-utive director and deputy chairman of
Unipalm, the connective software and service suppliers that is seeking a
listing in about a month's time.
'This company is the leading UK operator of Internet (a global computer
network) and Internet development is on the verge of lift-off,' is how
Hayter, 55, explains his interest.
He says he was introduced to Unipalm by 3i, who in turn knew him from cable
access-ories manufacturer Critchley where he is also on the board. Critchley
was floated at the end of 1992.
Hayter is doing some additional advisory work for the company, keeping him
busy seven or eight days a month. He says he wanted to go on the board,
rather than merely act as a consultant, because he was interested in a
longer term relationship with the company.
His last job at the stock exchange had been as managing director of the
trading markets division, and he describes his leaving as 'the best thing
that ever happened to me', adding that his last year working under the then
chief executive Peter Rawlins was 'quite difficult'.
Since then, Hayter (above right) has advised Shell on its international data
network, explored with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, aspects of
networked multi-media services, and been engaged in projects for stock
exchanges in France, Hungary Switzerland and Germany. His other
non-executive posts include Cognotec, the foreign exchange information and
trading house, and Synergo, a supplier of software to stockbrokers and fund
managers. He is also an advisory board member of Bankinter in Madrid.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Recruitment: Duty to report may not put the heat on
fraudsters - The debate on the role of auditors in detecting and acting on
corporate crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To listen to Mr Martyn Jones speak, you might think he was arguing from the
Conservative benches in the House of Commons for the motion on hanging on
Tuesday, rather than commenting from the solitude of his office on the
debate a week earlier about auditors' duties to regulators.
'In some countries they take fraudsters out and shoot them,' he says. 'Here
what do we do with them? They live the life of Riley, their charges are
reduced before trial, their expenses are paid, they go on bail, their
sentences are ludicrously short, their wives live well while they're inside,
you can't find the money they've stolen, and they do an advanced accounting
course to pass the time in jail.
'Meanwhile the accountancy profession sets up another committee, and adds to
the Byzantine structure of standards. Every time there's a scandal, the
auditor becomes the whipping boy. The fraudsters must be laughing their
heads off. People forget their names, they get another job and start over
again. What a fantastic way of life.'
Behind the rhetoric, Mr Jones, auditing technical partner with Touche Ross,
is raising some important questions about current approaches to corporate
fraud detection and prevention in the UK.
His outburst has been triggered by the debate in parliament last week that
has led to new statutory instruments requiring auditors to report any fraud
they detect to the regulators of banks, building societies, insurance
companies and the financial service sector.
The legislation was introduced in the wake of the 1992 Bingham report into
the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. It suggested
that the auditor's existing right in law to report fraud should be enhanced
into a formal duty.
Jones and other observers of the debate are sceptical of the new amendments.
They argue that auditors do currently alert regulators to fraud, either
directly or more commonly through the more discreet route of putting
pressure on their client to do so themselves.
The problem is not in communicating with regulators once fraud has been
discovered, but in identifying it in the first place. In other words, Jones
argues that auditors are very often unable to detect fraud.
'We can't put people under oath, demand powers of search, examine third
parties records or premises, insist on auditing related parties, or get
behind bank records to see money flows,' he says. 'In reality, auditors'
powers are very limited.'
He believes that most frauds require the use of a number of 'bit players' to
falsify documents or misrepresent facts which can mislead the auditors, and
yet who are rarely prosecuted. His solution is to increase the punishments
for those who engage in deceit.
There are currently provisions for these offences, most notably section 389A
of the 1985 Companies Act, which makes it a criminal offence to deceive the
auditor. But Jones calls the clause 'pathetic', arguing that it is rarely
used by prosecutors.
The only instance to date has been against Anthony Cole of Bestwood, who was
convicted last year of making a false statement to an auditor. Charges of
providing false information to auditors are also made in the current trials
of Mr Nazmu Virani of Control Securities and Mr Mohammed Baqi of BCCI. Mr
Muhammed Naviede faces a similar charge in the Arrows case scheduled to
begin in September.
It seems that the Serious Fraud Office tends to go for 'six of the best',
concentrating on a few more wide-ranging charges that encapsulate the
criminality of a fraud and which carry longer penalties. The risk is that
these are harder to prove, and do little to deter the bit players.
Jones would like to see extra barbs added to the clause by increasing the
existing maximum sentence of two years up to five, and making those found
guilty personally liable for any losses caused by the fraud. He says the
legislation should also be extended. The law on pension funds carries only a
Pounds 400 fine for not providing information to auditors, for example. The
regulations on deceiving auditors in flotation documents and for other
industry sectors are weak or non-existent. He would also like to see the
professional bodies take a tougher line.
These views have apparently been received with some sympathy by government.
Mr Robert Hughes, head of litigation support at Ernst &amp; Young, supports the
idea of the 'Nuremburg principles', by which minor players in a fraud would
be unable to excuse themselves by saying that they were only obeying orders.
Mr Julian Osborne, secretary to the professional ethics committee of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is less convinced.
He says the institute receives at least two substantive cases a week to its
anonymous ethical hotline from accountants concerned about what they have
come across. He says that accountants convicted of fraud will always be
subject to professional discipline, but that sometimes no trial takes place
because the police and revenue authorities may reach a settlement and decide
not to prosecute.
But he argues that when the institute investigates, the responsibility
should generally fall on the more senior accountants at board level. 'That
is more equitable,' he says. 'The others are not in a position of power, and
it may not be evidence from the orders they are given that something is
deceitful. They may just be told 'this is the way we're going to value stock
and don't question it.''
He would prefer new regulations to protect employees in companies, who
currently have none of the guarantees or privileges of auditors such as
confidentiality if they attempt to warn their superiors of suspected fraud.
A more sceptical view on Jones' case is that it throws up a smokescreen to
conceal the responsibilities of auditors. Perhaps, as Mr Austin Mitchell, MP
for Great Grimsby, suggested in the Commons debate last week, auditors
should be under an obligation to detect fraud: a requirement already in
place for auditors to local authorities.
Certainly the larger accountancy firms all offer fraud detection services.
For example, Mr Ian Huntingdon from the forensic accounting team at KPMG
Peat Marwick says his staff would be likely to detect more fraud than
auditors examining a company. But he stresses that they are employed for a
very different purpose, usually after fraud has been detected, and that the
time and costs involved are considerably greater. Others argue that this
more antagonistic approach to auditing would jeopardise client trust and
openness.
Mr Hughes adds that there are many warning signs in every audit. 'In 99
cases out of 100 they are not frauds, and the explanation is honest,' he
says.
Yet Mitchell's views are not isolated. Mr John Knox, deputy director of the
Serious Fraud Office, argued in a speech last year that auditors very often
fail to detect fraud. While one reason was the deceptions practised on them,
there were many others.
These included reliance on uncorroborated representations from management;
failure to identify related-party transactions; failure to understand the
nature of the business; and inadequate audit testing. Auditors were all too
often too trusting.
Ultimately, it is the fraudsters who deserve most attention and criticism.
But in many cases, auditors have spotted the rudiments of the fraud but not
drawn the right conclusions. That does not necessarily mean they have
deliberately conspired to withhold knowledge of fraud from regulators. But
it does mean they still need to think harder about whether they are doing
enough to meet the expectations placed upon them.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Regulator warms to British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, says it believes the senior management of
British Gas 'has genuinely embraced competition' only two months after the
government decreed that the company's monopoly in supplying 18m mainly
residential customers should be ended in 1998.
Ms Claire Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said in presenting the
regulator's annual report yesterday that 'on many fronts we both have the
same strategic aims'.
The regulator's enthusiastic assessment of British Gas's attitude to
competition was in marked contrast to earlier reports, in which the company
came in for severe criticism.
Ms Spottiswoode conceded, however, that British Gas's new attitude to future
competition was based in large part on its desire to reduce the influence of
the regulator on its businesses.
She said positive changes are already apparent as a result of the company's
decision last year to restructure its domestic operations into five business
areas.
She noted that the heads of the company's public gas supply business and its
transport and storage division were diverging on a number of issues, a sign
that the separation of the businesses was beginning to function.
The report praised British Gas for making good progress in slowing the rate
of growth in the number of consumer complaints.
Ofgas received 1,842 complaints from consumers last year compared with 1,827
in 1992 and 968 in 1991.
Progress was also being made on the consultation document which will contain
detailed plans for ending British Gas's monopoly. This will begin in 1996
with the opening to competition of 5 per cent of the market for users of
fewer than 2,500 therms a year.
The paper, which will be published jointly with the Department of Trade and
Industry, has been sent to ministers. Publication is expected by the middle
of next month.

FT  24 FEB 94 / MPs again back Sunday opening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill which will permit large stores to open for six hours on Sundays
cleared its final hurdle in the Commons last night when it was given a third
reading by a majority of 93 (311-218).
Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, said it would sort out the muddle of
Sunday trading after years of failed attempts to reform the 1950 Sunday
Shops Act.
He described it as a 'clear and enforceable' measure which would commend
itself to the majority of people in England and Wales.
The Sunday Trading Bill, which now goes to the Lords, survived virtually
unscathed when, during the report stage, opponents made a series of attempts
to wreck its key provision.
The absence of the party whips - MPs were allowed a free vote - led to
confusion with many Labour backbenchers uncertain how to vote on an
amendment seeking to limit the partial de-regulation to small shops with a
floorspace of less than 3,000 sq ft. It was defeated by 300 votes to 239,
with Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, rejecting demands for a recount.
An attempt to restrict Sunday opening to morning periods of not more than 4
1/2 hours was defeated by 308 votes to 258. Opponents of the bill gained one
success when an amendment preventing shops opening on Easter Sunday and when
Christmas falls on a Sunday was carried by 57 votes (304-247).

FT  24 FEB 94 / IoD urges end to 'enterprise deficit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is suffering from an 'enterprise deficit' according to the Institute
of Directors, which called yesterday for a rethink of the role of companies
and directors in the economy.
In a consultation document published yesterday the IoD argues that, in the
debate on corporate governance, too much emphasis has been placed on the
integrity of directors while the question of how best to promote enterprise
has been neglected.
Lord Young, IoD president and chairman of Cable and Wireless, said the
Cadbury report on corporate governance had limited itself to the behaviour
of directors whereas it was more important to 'get the wealth aspect first'.
'Enterprise without integrity is the motto of the Mafia. Integrity without
enterprise is the principle of nationalised industries. What we need is a
combination of both.'
The report argues that the enterprise deficit - the absence of innovation,
investment and risk-taking by companies - is partly responsible for the poor
international standing of Britain's economy. 'Future improvement in British
economic performance requires more new UK companies to be established and
more existing companies to grow,' the report says. It adds that this is
needed to balance the dominance of large quoted companies in the economy.
As the government increasingly loosens the contraints on business, the onus
rests with directors to ensure that they are running their companies in a
competent and professional manner, the document says.
It questions whether boards of directors are capable of supplying enterprise
on the scale the economy requires. It argues for a role for non-executive
directors that is more dynamic than the controlling role spelled out in the
Cadbury report.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD, said the IoD rejected the idea
that non-executives were watchdogs. 'They should be round the table bringing
new skills. You get the watchdog role for free. What you want them for is
what they can contribute.'
The document lays down four main functions for boards of directors. These
are: to set the strategic direction of the company, to make sure that
strategy is being implemented, to monitor executive management and to
provide information. It argues that all directors should take part in all
these tasks.
In setting directors' pay, the report states there should be no pay-offs for
failure, and that objectivity and openness are essential in determining what
compensation executives deserve.
The paper is part of an IoD initiative to associate itself more closely with
the needs of directors, as well as with its better known function as a
lobbying body. Earlier this week, the IoD published a draft set of standards
covering the composition and behaviour of boards.

FT  24 FEB 94 / IoD hoists new flags
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two new flags were hoisted outside the Institute of Directors' Pall Mall
headquarters yesterday. On the old flags the IoD's initials were all the
same size. But yesterday, the O was smaller and the D was bigger. Moreover
the D seemed to have been printed on top of the O.
This was no mistake, it was the IoD's new 'visual personality' which Mr
Peter Morgan, its director-general, unveiled with pride yesterday. 'The new
logo emphasises the D is for Director' he said.
The cost of the logo, which was designed by Mr Alan Fletcher - who has
worked on corporate identity for Reuters and Lloyd's of London - was Pounds
60,000, of which Pounds 40,000 was design fees. This compares with the
millions spent by companies such as BT.
The logo is part of an attempt to improve the IoD's sense of design, and
make its documents and brochures smarter. 'We do our radical policy papers
no favour by producing them in banal covers,' Mr Morgan said.
He defended the decision to spend the money. 'Corporate identity is a
vehicle to underpin the product,' he said.

FT  24 FEB 94 / TUC sets up new governing structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest internal shake-up of the Trades Union Congress for 73 years was
agreed yesterday by senior union leaders in spite of reservations about the
speed of the proposed changes from the TGWU general union.
The reforms, being carried through by Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary,
involve making the organisation more of a campaigning body.
All of its 17 committees are to be abolished and replaced by a governing
executive board. A new department is to be established for campaign and
lobbying activities. The general council is to meet about five times a year
instead of monthly.
The TUC is planning the 'relaunch' for March 1. A number of events and
conferences are to be held in the next few months on issues such as
unemployment and inner-city deprivation.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Labour policy on EU will hit jobs, says Fowler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party formally launched its European election campaign
yesterday with a broadside against Labour's 'damaging' employment policies.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, claimed that Labour was
committed to a European socialist group manifesto that would destroy
millions of British jobs.
But the attack was widely seen as an attempt to deflect attention from
tomorrow's scheduled launch of the federalist manifesto of the European
People's Party, the European parliament group which embraces the Tories.
Sir Norman said the Conservatives were not committed to the EPP manifesto,
which is likely to prompt an angry response from Euro-sceptic Tory
rightwingers.
He said the Conservatives would fight the June election on a separate
manifesto being drawn up by a group headed by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary.
However, the manifesto will not be published until close to the election in
an attempt to minimise the danger of worsening the party's deep divisions on
Europe.
Sir Norman said the socialist group's proposals for a statutory minimum wage
and a 35-hour week would destroy more than 2m jobs and cost British business
Pounds 20bn.
'A socialist Europe would mean a high-cost Europe, with new and heavier
burdens placed on business. Labour and their socialist friends would totally
undermine Britain's competitiveness in world markets,' he said.
Labour has repeatedly denied Conservative claims that it is committed to a
35-hour week. The idea is presented in the socialist group manifesto as one
of several options for job creation.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, dismissed the Tory attack as
'just another rehash of old lies and propaganda from a party bankrupt of
ideas'.
Mr Prescott said Labour was committed only to a review of 'voluntary
work-sharing', which would increase employment at the expense of overtime
working.
Sir Norman said the Conservatives would be 'fighting to win' the elections,
in spite of widespread expectations that the party will suffer a heavy
defeat.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Self-regulation of press sought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of British Editors, the Guild of Editors and the
International Press Institute yesterday launched a document detailing the
case against new legal restrictions on the media.
In the document - Media Freedom and Media Regulation - the three
organisations identify 46 statutes which they say inhibit reporting, list
the media's self-regulation measures and argue that there are potential
dangers in further restrictions on the public's right to know.
Mr James Bishop, ABE chairman, says in his preface to the document that
'there is continuing difficulty in reconciling the individual's right to
privacy and the public's right to know.
'But the legal constraints already in place, together with the latest steps
in self-regulation, provide sufficient protection of privacy and are more
than adequate to meet current parliamentary concern.'
The document was drafted by Prof Hugh Stephenson, professor of journalism at
London's City University, after a meeting of more than 60 newspaper,
magazine, radio and television editors last autumn.
The meeting followed pressure for legislation to make invasion of privacy a
civil wrong, and the replacement of the present system of press
self-regulation centred on the Press Complaints Commission.
The paper gives examples of news items it believes could have been barred by
legislation, including coverage of the Lyme Bay canoeing disaster, reports
of the acceptance of a foreign holiday from a prominent Palestinian by Mr
David Mellor, former heritage secretary, World in Action's investigation of
the Birmingham Six and the publication of Mr Michael Mates's letter to Mr
Asil Nadir.
Mr Bishop said self-regulation had been developing all the time. 'We believe
it is now working very effectively.'
Privacy legislation could not stop abuses, he said. 'There are laws against
murder but murders still happen.' Self-regulation meant editors sitting down
together to try to prevent any problems.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Race body aims to boost impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission for Racial Equality yesterday announced a new structure aimed
at making better use of its resources and meeting Citizen's Charter
standards.
Commission staff will be deployed to work more closely with other agencies
as part of a 'promotional drive throughout society'.
Mr Herman Ouseley, commission chairman, said racial discrimination was
'subtle, covert and sophisticated'. The restructuring was intended to make
the commission more responsive and effective, and to bring it closer to its
clients - both the institutions that came to it for guidance and the victims
of discrimination.
Under its Citizen's Charter undertakings the commission will set standards
for handling inquiries - for example acknowledging letters in two working
days and providing full replies in a further eight.
With resources limited and a budget unlikely to increase in real terms in
the near future, members of the commission believe greater collaboration
with other agencies offers the best chance of increasing the commission's
influence.
The commission is campaigning with other race relations bodies for stronger
laws. Members of the Commons home affairs committee are investigating racial
attacks and have been considering whether there should be a new specific
offence of racial violence or racial harassment.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Portillo defends curb on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday underlined
his determination to push ahead with the government's long-term review of
public spending in spite of accusations from some Tory backbenchers that the
project is being quietly shelved.
Mr Portillo told the Oxford Union yesterday that the government was
determined to pursue its 'root and branch' examination of the spending
policies of Whitehall departments, questioning the direction programmes were
taking and whether every aspect of the money spent was fully justified.
He said: 'Without a rigorous approach to planning and management there is a
real danger of public spending rising inexorably as a share of GDP. If
spending rises as a share of national income, either taxes must rise or
borrowing must rise, or both.'
Mr Portillo welcomed the results of fundamental reviews last year in social
security, health, education and at the Home Office.
He said eight more reviews were under way in areas such as transport, the
legal departments, Customs and the Treasury.
Some Tory backbenchers were concerned yesterday that - in spite of Mr
Portillo's assurances - the government had not cut departmental budgets with
the rigour called for in the first four reviews.
A senior Tory MP said: 'There is a great deal of scepticism, not about
Michael Portillo, but about whether anything will come from this whole
process. The reviews are referred to as a crutch whenever ministers are
under pressure, but nothing ever seems to happen.'
He rejected a claim by Mr Portillo yesterday that a restructuring of social
security spending announced in the review had been successfully implemented
in the last Budget.
Another backbencher said the reform of statutory sick pay arrangements and
the increased targeting of benefits were 'already in the pipeline before the
last Budget'.
He added that an important test of the government's convictions would be
whether it was prepared to cut the legal-aid budget in the forthcoming
review of legal departments.
Mr Portillo was keen yesterday to reject another criticism of the last
Budget, that cuts in departmental spending were brought about by using the
emergency reserve.
He said that money was used in the Budget 'not to boost expenditure
programmes but to cut government borrowing'. He added that it had always
been spent in previous Budgets, implying that it was wrong for anyone to
suggest otherwise.

FT  24 FEB 94 / BNF faces further Sellafield challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels faces a further legal challenge over its Sellafield
nuclear waste reprocessing complex in Cumbria, which has been dogged by
controversy over the site's Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant.
Copeland borough councillors decided on Tuesday night to grant outline
planning permission to BNF for its proposed Pounds 300m mixed oxide (Mox)
fuel manufacturing plant. This would mix plutonium from the adjacent Thorp
plant with uranium to produce nuclear reactor fuel for sale to Europe and
the Far East.
Yesterday Nuclear-Free Local Authorities, representing 160 councils
throughout Britain, said it was considering applying for judicial review of
the decision.
The authorities argue that BNF's environmental statement for the Mox plant,
and the way Copeland handled the application, breached European law. They
also contend BNF has not demonstrated that the plant's benefits would
outweigh its drawbacks.
The go-ahead was also condemned by anti-nuclear groups which argue that Mox
fuel is commercially unattractive, and that its main function will be to
convert the plutonium stockpile from Thorp's operation into a different
form.
Mr Simon Roberts of Friends of the Earth said: 'It's a logical extension of
the misguided logic which led to Thorp. BNF seem keen to create a herd of
white elephants at Sellafield.'
Last October BNF began operating a Pounds 26m demonstration Mox plant at
Sellafield, with an 8-tonne annual fuel output capacity. The main Mox plant,
which will create 200 jobs, would have a 120-tonne annual output. Worldwide
demand for Mox fuel is below 100 tonnes annually but BNF expects it to
exceed 300 tonnes by the year 2000.
Its only firm Mox customer is NOK, the Swiss utility, but BNF is talking to
potential customers in Germany and Japan. The company says the fuel will be
30 per cent cheaper than conventional uranium fuel: 'We're here to make
money ultimately; if it wasn't cost effective we wouldn't be able to do it.'
Mr Bob Metcalfe, Copeland's director of development and services, said the
council had followed legal advice on its handling of the application. The
economics of Mox fuel were not a planning matter, he added. Mr Metcalfe said
the council's legal advice suggested any legal challenge could not be
sustained.
The nuclear-free authorities will discuss the possibility of a legal
challenge on Monday.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Dedicated followers of 1960s fashions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The irony seems to have escaped the Conservatives. For a year now - even
before it coined that ill-fated phrase 'back to basics' - Mr John Major's
government has been promising to overturn the fashionable nostrums of the
1960s.
This week most of the cabinet and much of the Tory party lined up behind
those same icons of social liberalism. An attempt to reimpose capital
punishment was thrown out by a huge majority. MPs then voted to lower the
homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18.
There were four great acts of parliament during the 1960s which defined the
climate of the age. One abolished hanging. Another liberalised the divorce
law. Two more legalised abortion and decriminalised homosexuality.
This week's votes underlined that for all the government's rhetoric there is
no going back. Fashions of the 1960s have become conventional wisdom of the
1990s. The cabinet, fortunately, shares that wisdom.
Take the hanging vote. Only two members of the cabinet - Mr John Redwood and
Mr Ian Lang - voted with the pro-lobby. Despite his sympathy for some of the
less civilised instincts of the Tory party conference, Mr Michael Howard was
at the forefront of those arguing against.
The line-up on the age of consent for homosexuals was not much different.
Only four senior ministers - Mr Redwood again, Mr John Gummer, Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr John Patten - lined up against the move to 18.
More opposed calls for homosexuals to be treated equally with heterosexuals
by setting 16 as the age of consent. But many of these ministers did so in
the expectation that two or three years from now parliament will vote for
just that.
The picture is not quite as straightforward as regards abortion. Parliament
has recently reduced the limit under which foetuses can be aborted. But that
decision was linked to advances in medical science rather than to any shift
in the moral climate.
As for the final benchmark of the swinging 60s - liberalisation of the
divorce law - the government seems set to move further in the same
direction.
Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, is known to favour reducing the minimum
period of separation before divorce from two years to one. Others in the
cabinet are less sure. But nearly all accept that the tide is flowing that
way. So the pillars of 1960s liberalism remain in place - supported one and
all by a prime minister and a cabinet publicly pledged to return to the
mythical good old days of the 1950s.
They might argue that one or two things have changed in recent weeks. The
success of the tabloids in linking 'back to basics' with the private lives
of MPs has led Mr Major to take a tougher line with errant ministers. But
even here there is an important caveat: only those sexual indiscretions
which reach the public domain are to be swiftly punished.
The government is adamant that its flagship theme remains in place, but the
words are already becoming hard to find in ministerial speeches. It would be
bad politics to admit defeat. But like the Citizen's Charter before it, it
can be allowed quietly to sink into oblivion. Anyway, the government's
problems run much deeper. The present confusion is a symptom not a cause.
It was elected in 1992 on a platform which promised to call a halt to the
revolutionary radicalism of the Thatcherite 1980s. In its place Mr Major
offered a more conventional conservatism which promised to make things work
rather than to dismantle them.
But the prime minister has been running in the opposite direction ever
since, attempting to define his administration with radical legislation from
which even Baroness Thatcher would have retreated.
Rail privatisation, the shake-up of the police, yet another education bill
and the push for single-tier local authorities are symptomatic of a
government frightened to stop legislating lest it then finds itself with
nothing to say. And when the new laws go wrong - as they frequently do - it
has a perfect excuse for yet more legislation.
Traditional strengths of Conservatism - competent management, measured
change and careful reform - have been forgotten as ministers scramble to put
more laws on to the statute book. An approach that manages to be frantic and
fragmented has forced Mr Major to look to snappy but empty slogans to
provide a semblance of coherence.
This week's parliamentary triumphs for the social liberalism of the 1960s
provided another salutary reminder that politics is just a bit more
complicated than that.
