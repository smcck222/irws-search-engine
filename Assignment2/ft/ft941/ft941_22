FT  24 FEB 94 / Labour raps grant aid to Tory council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the government of giving Wandsworth council an
unfair share of grants. It said the share-out would allow the London borough
 -a Conservative 'flagship' - to set a low council tax.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said Wandsworth was receiving
11.6 per cent of the government's total 'non-needs' grants for England even
though the borough has only 0.9 per cent of the population. The move put
council tax at the centre of Labour's local election campaign in London.
Labour attacked Wandsworth's high figures for transitional relief - intended
to shield individuals who had a low poll tax from sharp annual increases -
and the 'buffering' grant it had received to minimise the impact of changes
in the formula for distributing grant. According to Mr Straw, these two
subsidies were equivalent to Pounds 474 for each Wandsworth council
taxpayer.
'The favouritism shown to Wandsworth this year is a consequence of the way
in which the government has stuffed central government grant into the
borough over the past few years,' he said. 'It is because government grant
kept the poll tax and then the council tax artificially low in the borough
that it is to receive so much relief this year.'
Westminster, a neighbouring Conservative borough, has set the current lowest
council tax in England, at Pounds 245 for properties in band D, which
represents a Pounds 50 cut since 1993-94.
Most other London local authorities are likely to set their council tax next
week.
County councils yesterday attacked the local government minister's assertion
that improving the current two-tier system of local government is not
allowed by law.
The comments, made by Mr David Curry at a conference of the Association of
District Councils on Tuesday, dashed counties' hopes of a compromise outcome
to the local government review, which would see counties devolve some of
their powers to districts.
Mr Curry said the legislation allowed only for the continuation of the
two-tier status quo or for all-purpose unitary authorities.
However, counties now seem set on continuing their call for less radical
reforms of the existing structure.
Ms Josie Farrington, leader of the Labour-controlled Association of County
Councils, claimed Mr Curry had 'missed the point'. She said: 'It is now
clear that the local government commission can recommend a continuation of
the two-tier structure.
'Obviously, where that structure ought to be improved it can be. However,
contrary to what Mr Curry said, there is no need to change the law to enable
this to happen.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / Code adopted for funeral payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main representative organisation for providers of prepaid funeral plans
yesterday responded to Monday's launch of an Office of Fair Trading
investigation into the industry by announcing its own code of practice.
The National Association for Pre-Paid Funeral Plans, whose six member
companies represent more than 75 per cent of the industry, said the code
aimed to 'ensure the highest standards of practice are maintained when
dealing with this . . . area of planning'.
The code stipulates that member companies must practise tasteful
advertising, set up independent trust funds with separate custodians, submit
to annual actuarial or accountants' reviews and provide any information
requested by the association. There is also a formal complaints procedure.
Mr Chris Pitchford, sales and marketing director for the company Dignity,
who speaks on behalf of the association, said: 'The industry needs an
association that has teeth. We would like to have the same reputation as the
Association of British Travel Agents.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / CBI raps pay costs in public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's failure to control public-sector pay is one of the main
reasons for the current tax increases, the Confederation of British Industry
said yesterday.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said yesterday: 'During the
recession total government paybills have risen from 13 per cent to 14.2 per
cent of national output. That is a good part of the reason we now face large
tax increases.'
He was introducing a CBI paper urging the public sector to copy the
private-sector shift to decentralised bargaining and pay flexibility.
The paper says that the annual increase in paybills in private-sector
manufacturing and services fell close to zero last year compared with a rise
of nearly 4 per cent in the public sector.
The CBI said service-sector settlements rose 2.6 per cent in the third
quarter of 1993 compared with an earnings rise of 2.25 per cent. It said
this was the first time in living memory that earnings had risen more slowly
than settlements.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Directors guided on insider trade law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Stock Exchange-sponsored committee will today issue a code of conduct
telling company directors they should no longer privately correct individual
analysts' profit forecasts, but must instead inform the entire market of
such price-sensitive information.
Institutional investors and stockbrokers who receive unpublished price
sensitive information will also be advised to encourage companies to publish
the information widely.
The new code has been drawn up so that companies, shareholders and
stockbrokers can be confident that they can communicate with each other
without infringing the Criminal Justice Act provision on insider trading,
which will come into force next Tuesday.
The code has been drafted by a committee consisting of representatives of
the 100 Group of finance directors, the Institutional Fund Managers
Association and the Association of British Insurers.
A member of the committee said: 'It does spell out the circumstances under
which the companies should disclose information and points out that
dribbling out information is unacceptable.'
Among other things, the document discusses how company directors should deal
with analysts' earnings estimates which are wildly wrong. It will tell
companies that they are not required to correct a false impression by an
analyst. However, if a correction is given to the analyst, it must be
simultaneously communicated to the market as a whole.
A committee member said the committee was particularly concerned about
earnings forecasts from analysts who are employed by the company's own
stockbroker 'whose forecasts have been surprisingly accurate'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Tories join attack on army job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was criticised by all parties at Westminster yesterday over a
new round of army redundancies.
Tory backbenchers joined MPs from the opposition parties to attack the 7,000
job losses made under the third phase of a cuts programme.
There was particular concern about the prospect of redundancies among
officers and other ranks serving in Bosnia.
Downing Street officials said last night that the number of compulsory
redundancies among troops in Bosnia would 'only just' run into double
figures. Redundancies would be 'across the board'. It would be the same for
troops in Ulster and elsewhere as it would be for those in Bosnia.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, giving details of the cuts in a
parliamentary written answer, said there would be just over 1,000
redundancies. All those selected would be notified today.
Mr Winston Churchill, a Tory member of the cross-party Commons defence
committee, said: 'We are strongly opposed, on an all-party committee basis,
to these cuts.'
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said the government was 'badly
mismanaging British military forces'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Police and students clash in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Police clashed with students in London yesterday during a demonstration in
protest against cuts in the value of the student grant. About 7,000 students
took part in the march organised by the leftwing Student Activist Alliance.
The action followed the government decision - announced in the November
Budget - to cut grants by 10 per cent in the next academic year. Similar
cuts are planned for the next two years. The shortfall will be made up with
student loans.
The demonstrators forced the closure of Westminster, Lambeth, Waterloo and
Hungerford bridges yesterday afternoon - causing widespread traffic
problems.
The police made three arrests for public disorder but said that otherwise
the demonstrators were 'fairly quiet'.
The alliance hopes to spread its campaign with a national shutdown of
colleges and universities in support of a strike by Natfhe, the lecturers'
union, on March 1.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Companies breach R&amp;D accounting standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A quarter of companies that refer to research-and-development expenditure in
their annual reports are breaching accounting standards, a survey of
financial reporting said yesterday.
From a sample of 300 companies, 148 disclose evidence of R&amp;D - usually in
the chairman's statement - but 25 per cent of these do not show the amount
they spend. Fourteen per cent of the 65 FT-SE 100 companies that spend on
R&amp;D do not disclose the amount.
This practice contradicts SSAP 13, the accounting standard on R&amp;D, which
demands disclosure of the amount split between spending in the current year
and that capitalised over future years.
The details emerge in Financial Reporting 1993-94, the annual survey of
company accounts produced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales.
Mr David Tonkin, joint editor, said it was 'misleading' for companies to
state that they spent money on R&amp;D unless the amount was material. If it was
material, the amount should be disclosed.
The survey shows that reporting practice is beginning to be affected by the
changing accounting standards regime, especially FRS 3, the new standard on
the profit-and-loss account. It shows that the number of companies with
'extraordinary items' - abolished by the standard - fell from 52 per cent in
last year's survey to 26 per cent.
It also shows a slight increase in the number of accounts qualified or
prefaced by special comments from companies' auditors - rising from 4 per
cent to 6 per cent.
A chapter in the book describes existing regulations governing the
advertising of half-year reports as 'lamentable'.
It recommends that companies should be obliged to state whether they are
exempt from requirements of the Stock Exchange, and says that the report
should be dated.
The survey suggests that the reforms being undertaken by the Accounting
Standards Board are emphasising disclosure rather than tightly prescriptive
measurement.

FT  24 FEB 94 / NHS 'is little improved' by reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Health Service reforms have so far done little to improve quality
of service or patient choice, one of the most extensive studies of the
service concludes today.
The study, by the King's Fund Institute healthcare think-tank, suggests that
this may be the result of the massive scale of organisational change that
the reforms generated. New systems that have been put in place, it
concludes, offer the potential for real gains over the next few years.
The reforms, based on dividing responsibility for purchasing healthcare from
its provision within an internal market, came into effect in April 1991.
Seven research projects were funded by the King's Fund, with the results
published today by Professor Ray Robinson, director of the Institute of
Health Policy Studies at Southampton University, and Professor Julian Le
Grand, who lectures on health policy at the London School of Economics.
Only GP fundholding is identified as having produced benefits, notably in
improving the responsiveness of hospitals to GPs' views. The report
acknowledges that there is anxiety about the possibility of fundholding GPs'
patients getting preferential treatment, but says this might simply be a
transitional problem.
Forming NHS trusts to manage hospitals and other services offers the
potential for greater efficiency through competition, says the report,
although claims that trusts have led to greater efficiency are hard to
substantiate.
Patient involvement in the choice of hospital to which they are referred has
always been low and, at least during the early years of the reforms, this
does not appear to have changed. Services for elderly people have not
improved in terms of choice, accessibility, communication or quality.
Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS, said changes to the structure
of the health service were not yet fully in place. Much streamlining had yet
to be achieved.
Sir Duncan added that the report recognised the problem of a systematic
evaluation of the reforms.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Government cuts insurance tax rate to 2.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday bowed to pressure from the insurance industry by
modifying the proposed tax on premiums and reducing its rate from 3 per cent
to 2.5 per cent.
The change will only marginally reduce the amount of money raised annually
from the tax, introduced in the November Budget - but the changes are
expected to yield administrative savings for insurance companies and were
widely welcomed by the industry.
Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British
Insurers, said: 'It is much easier for everybody and good news for
policyholders.'
Following the changes, announced yesterday by Sir John Cope,
paymaster-general, the premium tax will be charged on insurance premiums on
a gross rather than a net basis - before, rather than after the deduction of
brokerage commission. The change will make the tax easier for insurance
companies to collect, and the rate has been lowered to reduce the extra
burden on insurers and their customers which would have resulted.
Sir John said: 'The reduction of the rate is directly linked to the decision
to tax gross rather than net premiums. We have been able to address the
concerns of the insurance industry about the operation of the new tax to
make it simpler and . . . its administration easier.'
The yield from the tax will now be about Pounds 760m in its first full year
rising to Pounds 835m in 1996-97. That compares with forecasts - calculated
on the basis of a 3 per cent rate - of Pounds 775m and Pounds 840m.
Sir John said the proposed changes met the insurance industry's requests
'for greater flexibility and for arrangements which tie in more closely with
existing systems'.
The change will have no impact on policyholders, who will still face average
increases of 35p per week on buildings, contents and motor insurance.
Mr Baker said the tax as originally proposed would have 'distorted'
competition between companies which sell direct to the public and those
which sell through brokers. Commission rates differ between types of
insurance, so the tax would also have been difficult to administer.
Mr Peter Foster, general manager, finance, of Commercial Union, the UK's
largest composite (general and life) insurance company, said: 'There is
still a danger that the rate of the tax could be increased, but obviously
people have been taking note of the representations the industry has made.'
Insurers will be able to account for the tax in line with existing
accounting procedures rather than on a 'cash receipts basis'. They will be
able to account for the tax quarterly rather than monthly as originally
proposed, and longer-term policies, for which a premium has already been
paid, will not be subject to the tax.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Thatcher may have tried to skirt aid rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, appears to have tried to
circumvent government rules on aid and arms sales by making separate
references to offers of defence equipment and overseas aid in a letter sent
to the Malaysian government in 1988.
The letter, which was sent to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, confirmed that Britain would go ahead with a promised offer of aid
that would eventually be used to build a dam on the Pergau river.
But careful phrasing of the letter also assured him that Britain wanted to
complete the sale of Pounds 1bn of defence equipment, without expressly
linking the two issues.
Details of the document were given yesterday to members of the Commons
foreign affairs committee, which next week will cross-examine Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, on Britain's decision in 1988 to offer nearly
Pounds 300m of aid to help build the Pergau dam.
The dam project has been described by government auditors as 'a very bad
buy'. Labour MPs have accused ministers of breaking established guidelines
on aid provision in order to secure a defence deal with the Kuala Lumpur
government.
In a statement made to the committee this week Mr Hurd acknowledged that the
aid provision and defence sales were 'briefly linked' in a protocol in March
1988 on the sales of military equipment signed by Lord Younger, then defence
secretary.
A Foreign Office summary of the protocol was given to the committee
yesterday. It says that the protocol contained a reference to a grant in
support of non-military projects 'which should amount to no less than a
specific value of the (defence) equipment'.
In the months following the signing of the protocol, however, the government
took furious measures to formally de-link the projects, while assuring
Malaysia that both were going ahead.
Lady Thatcher's letter of August 8 of that year was a critical assurance. A
Foreign Office summary of the letter said that 'she was glad to be able to
confirm the assurance that the British government had always given the
Malaysian government that Pounds 70m of grant aid in association with Pounds
130m of ECGD cover would be available for civil projects'.
But the summary continues: 'The prime minister said she looked forward to Dr
Mahathir's visit to Britain in September 1988, when she hoped that the
memorandum of understanding on the defence package could be signed.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / TSB supports creation of PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB, the banking group, yesterday came out in support of the proposed
Personal Investment Authority and announced its plan to apply for membership
of the new regulator.
Elsewhere, doubts about the new authority were expressed by the Consumers'
Association which told the Commons Treasury committee that there should be a
shift to 'a simple, clear system of statutory regulation'.
The TSB move will be a welcome boost to the PIA, which faces continued
scepticism in the financial services industry. The authority must attract
substantial support in order to achieve credibility.
TSB said bringing all supervision and regulation of financial services for
personal customers under one body would make it easier to achieve higher and
more consistent standards. TSB's existing regulator is Lautro, the
self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry.
In evidence to the MPs the Consumers' Association called for a new office of
director-general of investor protection, directly accountable to government
and parliament. The regulator would have statutory powers to make the
industry comply and would be funded by a statutory levy.
The association said a successful PIA would help to rationalise the current
regulatory structure but its effectiveness would be limited by the
continuing ability of individuals and companies in the sector to choose
their own regulator.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Single mothers on increase in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a third of births in Wales are to unmarried women, a rate which
has tripled in a decade, official figures showed yesterday.
The latest edition of Welsh Social Trends says that 340 of every 1,000
births were outside marriage in 1992 compared with 312 in England and Wales
as a whole. The rate is nearly nine times higher than it was 40 years ago.
Nearly half of all households in Wales were headed in 1992 by someone who
was economically inactive or unemployed. In 1991 average earnings for
full-time male workers were only 87 per cent of the British figure.
The report shows migration was the most important factor in population
change, overshadowing natural change. In recent years, most Welsh counties
have had net inflows of people and by 2011 the population is expected to
rise by 124,000 to 3.01m.
The number of people who speak Welsh has risen slightly since 1981, although
there were far fewer than before the second world war. In 1991 more than
500,000 people in the principality spoke Welsh, with the proportion of
children who were either fluent or could speak a 'fair amount' higher than
in the population as a whole.

Mr Churchill said the committee did not regard the cuts as inevitable. The
committee had 'called on the government last year not only to cease these
cuts but possibly to reverse them'.
He added: 'I happen to be opposed to all these redundancies, but the fact is
that if one is going to have redundancies it is regrettably impossible to be
selective as between those who happen at any moment to be in Northern
Ireland, the Falklands, Cyprus or, as the case may be, Bosnia.'
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said it was 'outrageous' that
British troops would be 'sacked' while they were risking their lives in
Bosnia.
The government was 'badly mismanaging British military forces'. What was
needed was a full defence review rather than 'arbitrary cuts imposed by the
Treasury'.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said the cuts were
'foolish and insensitive'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / CBI hits at paybill for public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's failure to control public-sector pay is one of the main
reasons for the current tax increases, according to the Confederation of
British Industry.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said yesterday: 'During the
recession total government paybills have risen from 13 per cent to 14.2 per
cent of national output. That is a good part of the reason we now face large
tax increases.'
He was introducing a CBI paper urging the public sector to copy the
private-sector shift to decentralised bargaining and pay flexibility.
'During the 1980s a big gap opened up between public and private sector in
pay determination,' he said.
The paper says that the annual increase in paybills in private-sector
manufacturing and services fell close to zero last year compared with a rise
of nearly 4 per cent in the public sector.
The CBI says that freezing the public-sector paybill, as the government
intends to do each year until 1997, will lead to job losses. This will not
increase unemployment provided the private sector expands to absorb the
public-sector jobs.
The CBI intervention comes just a few weeks before pay determination is
decentralised for about 300,000 civil servants in civil service agencies.
However most of the big agencies - such as the benefits agency - are
expected to stick to the national pay rates for the immediate future. The
CBI said service-sector earnings rose more slowly than settlements for the
first time in living memory. This 'negative earnings drift' was the result
of lower overtime and bonus payments. Service-sector settlements at 2.6 per
cent in the third quarter of last year compared with an earnings increase of
2.25 per cent.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Hattersley to quit at next election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, is to leave parliament at
the next general election after more than 30 years as an MP. His decision,
although not unexpected, will deprive Labour of one of its few MPs with
ministerial experience.
Yesterday's announcement came just two weeks after Mr Bryan Gould, another
leading Labour figure of the past decade, said he was quitting politics to
return to his native New Zealand.
Mr Hattersley, 61, a novelist and accomplished newspaper columnist, told
officials in his Birmingham Sparkbrook constituency that in two years he
would want to 'concentrate on books not speeches'. He suggested that his
successor should come from 'one of the minority communities who have made
their home in this constituency'.
A Yorkshireman with a fondness for the good life, Mr Hattersley served for
three years in the Callaghan cabinet of the late 1970s as secretary of state
for prices and consumer protection.
He is better remembered as the junior partner to Mr Neil Kinnock on the
'dream ticket' of 1983 that was to lead the party to two straight general
election defeats.
Mr Hattersley was widely seen as the former leader's rightwing foil,
especially in the early days of their partnership. His departmental
responsibilities, first as Labour's chief Treasury spokesman and later as
spokesman for home affairs, helped him maintain a high profile at
Westminster.

FT  24 FEB 94 / M-way tolls to be levied from 1998
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 375 companies have responded to a call from the government for
proposals to develop an electronic tolling system for Britain's motorways.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday announced the timetable
for applications from companies to take part in trials. The government
intends that charging of tolls will start in 1998.
Ninety per cent of companies that had expressed an interest were British, Mr
MacGregor said. ICL, the Japanese-owned computer company, said it was
interested in taking part.
The cost of installing electronic equipment at the 700 motorway junctions
could exceed Pounds 100m, Mr MacGregor said. The trials would cost several
million pounds.
Many other countries are working on electronic tolls but none of them yet
has a system which could cope with the volumes of traffic on Britain's
motorways or with the features which the government wants to include.
The tolling system would have to work on motorways carrying up to 12,000
vehicles an hour at speeds of up to 70 mph without slowing traffic flow. It
would have to allow charges to be varied according to time of day and
vehicle type.
The government intends to install a fully electronic system with no facility
for motorists to pay cash. But it would have to take account of foreign
visitors and people making unplanned emergency trips.
One possibility is for a system of smart cards on vehicle windscreens which
would be 'read' by monitors on overhead gantries.
Toll booths common on Continental and US motorways have been rejected
because they require too much space and slow traffic.
The system chosen must be fraud-proof and allow the authorities to trace
motorists who travel without paying. However, the system must allow
motorists the option of choosing that their routes should not be traceable,
although there might be an extra charge for this.
France, Germany and Austria are soon to start limited tests of electronic
tolling. The British government is keen to introduce a system compatible
with other European Union members and holds regular discussions with French
and German officials.
The government has previously calculated that, if tolls were set at 1.5p a
mile for cars and 4.5p for trucks, tolling the 1,900 mile motorway network
would raise Pounds 700m a year.

A fleet of electric cars may be launched in Coventry in 1996. Warwickshire
Institute is conducting a Pounds 50,000 feasibility study on the scheme for
the city and Peugeot, the French car company.
The project, backed by a consortium which includes PowerGen, IBM and East
Midlands Electricity, is planned to coincide with the centenary of the
British car industry and a redevelopment of the city centre. It is likely to
provide electric cars hired for individual journeys using a 'smart card'
electronic monitoring system.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Press bodies detail case against regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of British Editors, the Guild of Editors and the
International Press Institute yesterday launched a document detailing the
case against new legal restrictions on the media.
The document identifies 46 statutes which they say inhibit reporting, lists
the media's selfregulation measures and argues that there are potential
dangers in further restrictions on the public's right to know.
Mr James Bishop, ABE chairman, says that 'there is continuing difficulty in
reconciling the individual's right to privacy and the public's right to
know. But the legal constraints already in place, together with the latest
steps in self-regulation, provide sufficient protection of privacy and are
more than adequate to meet current parliamentary concern.'
The document was drafted by Professor Hugh Stephenson, professor of
journalism at London's City University, after a meeting of more than 60
newspaper, magazine, radio and television editors last autumn.
There has been pressure from outside the industry for legislation to make
invasion of privacy a civil wrong, and for the replacement of the present
system of press self-regulation.

Staff will be deployed to work more closely with other agencies as part of a

Mr Herman Ouseley, commission chairman, said racial discrimination was

the commission more responsive and effective, and to bring it closer to its
clients - both the institutions that came to it for guidance and the victims
of discrimination.

Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, said in a written answer that
3,434 company winding-up orders had been made following petitions by Customs
and Excise. This was out of a total of 9,542 orders. In 1987-88 just 690 of
the 3,952 winding-up orders were made following Customs and Excise

FT  24 FEB 94 / Two-year house price rise forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices will rise faster than general inflation over the next two
years, says a report by brokers' firm UBS. In the medium term it expects
prices to stagnate in real terms.
The report says economic and demographic factors should 'prevent a return to
an 80s-style boom' and predicts that between 1996 and 2000 house prices will
rise broadly in line with general inflation, 'implying little hope of real
capital gains'.
The report warns that the number of first-time buyers would fall over the
next five years. A cautious approach to lending by building societies and
banks, the overhang of debt and fears of potential buyers that history might
repeat itself would also inhibit demand.
In the short term the brokers expect house prices to rise by 7 per cent this
year and the same amount in 1995.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Ashdown calls for defeat of BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first priority of every democratic political party must be to stamp out
the far-right British National Party in Tower Hamlets in May's council
elections, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, told his party's
London region conference last night.
Mr Ashdown said the politics of race must not be allowed to get a grip again
in London's East End. Provided that was the first priority of the Liberal
Democrat campaign in the Isle of Dogs, where the BNP won a by-election in
September, he would campaign there.
A Liberal Democrat inquiry found that some of the party's activists in Tower
Hamlets had pandered to racist sentiment in leaflets distributed during the
by-election.
Tower Hamlets party members accepted the findings this month only after
being threatened with suspension from the national party.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Decision due today on MGN bid for Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and Independent
on Sunday newspapers, will meet again today to decide whether to recommend
to shareholders the takeover bid by a consortium led by Mirror Group
Newspapers.
An announcement is thought possible today. But Newspaper Publishing's
independent directors would not comment on the outcome of a meeting held
yesterday, other than to repeat their commitment to making a response 'as
soon as practicable'.
The directors added: 'There is a constructive dialogue (with the consortium)
that needs to continue. The discussion we have had has been a useful one.'
The MGN-led consortium raised its bid on Sunday from 261.6p to 350p a share,
in a mixture of cash and MGN shares, valuing the company at Pounds 73.65m.
However, it did not raise the cash alternative of 250p per share.
Other members of the consortium, which already holds more than 47 per cent
of Newspaper Publishing, include El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy,
and three founders of the newspapers.
Newspaper Publishing's directors held back on Monday from recommending the
consortium's offer until it received more details. But it is thought likely
to recommend it - unless it receives a rival bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly, the
Irish publisher.
Mr O'Reilly's company, Independent Newspapers of Ireland, raised its stake
in Newspaper Publishing from 24.99 per cent to 29.99 per cent on Tuesday -
the maximum possible without triggering a full bid for the company - subject
to approval under competition regulations from the Department of Trade and
Industry.
The Irish company says it is keeping all options open although Mr O'Reilly
has consistently said his aim was to be a significant minority shareholder
who could play a positive role in revitalising the newspapers. Observers
suggest Mr O'Reilly would be deterred from launching a full bid by the high
price he would need to pay to woo the continental European shareholders.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Tories to contract out running of annual conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory party managers are taking the government's business philosophy to heart
 -Conservative Central Office is to contract out management of its annual
conference with the aim of making a profit from it.
Officials said the autumn conference, one of the centrepieces of the
political calendar, usually costs the party a lot of money, but they
declined to say how much.
Under contracting out, the party hopes this year to break even and make a
significant profit in future years. The party said yesterday that CCO
Conferences, a new subsidiary of the World Conference Travel management
consultancy, would manage the conference as well as the party's other main
gatherings, including the local government conference, the central council
and the Scottish, Welsh and women's conferences.
Party officials said the new arrangements reflected the party's need to put
its finances on a firmer footing.
In recent months the party has gone to some lengths to put its finances in
order after a deficit of Pounds 15.3m in the year to March 1993. The new
company will be responsible for arranging most of the facilities at the
conference, including accreditation, hotel accommodation and the design of
the stage.
An important aim will be to increase revenue from a commercial exhibition
traditionally held in the conference foyer.
Exhibitors include companies and other bodies which wish to lobby delegates.
The party insisted that there would be no increases in the amount charged to
delegates to attend the annual conference, which is held in Blackpool,
Brighton or Bournemouth.
The chief executive of the new company is Mr Michael Lockett, the owner and
founder of World Conference Travel. Mr Tim Collins, the Tory party's
director of communications, will be the non-executive chairman.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said yesterday: 'By applying the
Conservative principle of contracting out to this part of our own activities
at Central Office, I expect the party at all levels to reap significant
gains.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / Unionists in warning on peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government attempts to broker a political settlement in Northern Ireland had
a fresh setback yesterday when a senior Ulster Unionist said that his
party's participation in future round-table discussions could not be taken
for granted.
The warning came as senior ministers stepped up their efforts - in advance
of Sinn Fein's annual conference near Dublin this weekend - to persuade the
IRA's political wing to accept the Downing Street declaration.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, used speeches in Birmingham and London to offer fresh reassurance
to nationalists about the government's aims and intentions.
Sir Patrick sought to cover new ground in explaining how London expected
north-south relations to develop. He emphasised that a settlement could
provide new safeguards against discrimination.
As unionists in Ulster reacted suspiciously to Sir Patrick's remarks Mr
James Nicholson, UUP chairman and leader of the party's team in the
political talks process, warned that London and Dublin should 'in no way'
take the position of the province's largest party for granted.
Mr Nicholson, an MEP, said from Brussels that the UUP would not return to
round-table talks unless there was 'a strong possibility that the process
would move forward in a positive manner'.
He emphasised that the UUP had not endorsed the declaration.
Mr Nicholson complained that his last meeting with Mr Michael Ancram, the
Northern Ireland minister co-ordinating the talks process, was 'quite
frankly, a waste of time'. He said: 'The process was going nowhere. The
whole thing does not add up as far as we are concerned.'
Sir Patrick said there was a role for 'new institutions which will recruit .
. . the talents of all the people in the island of Ireland, so as to develop
purposefully and profitably the relationship between the two parts of the
island.'
He said that as trust and confidence grew north-south institutions could
'help transform the relationship between nationalists and unionists and -
but only if it was so agreed - they could take on an increasingly dynamic
role on the island and beyond it.'
There was 'no necessity for these institutions to impinge on either
country's sovereign independence'.
Sir Patrick said a political accommodation 'might well' include 'some form
of entrenchment of human rights.' He added: 'There could be agreement to
ensure that the nationalist and unionist identities would genuinely, and in
practical ways, enjoy parity of esteem.'

FT  24 FEB 94 / Labour leaders resist shops bill policy switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour policy switch on Sunday trading aimed at securing the defeat of the
bill providing for limited de-regulation in England and Wales was ruled out
by Ms Joan Ruddock, a junior shadow home office minister, in the Commons
last night.
She made clear that Labour MPs would not be whipped to vote against the
third reading in spite of the government's refusal to include improved
employment protection provisions in the bill. Ms Ruddock said Labour MPs
would have a free vote - as they did for the second reading of the bill.
Mr Ray Powell, a Labour whip who is sponsored by the Usdaw shopworkers'
union, bitterly attacked the free vote decision.
He recalled that Labour MPs were subjected to a three-line whip during the
committee stage on the employment protection issue.
Mr David Alton, Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Mossley Hill, protested
that the second reading majority, to which he contributed, had been obtained
on the basis of a 'false prospectus'.
Mr Alton looked to the House of Lords to remedy the situation should it
prove impossible to defeat the bill in the Commons.

FT  24 FEB 94 / British Gas 'genuinely embracing' competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, says it believes British Gas 'has
genuinely embraced competition', only two months after the government
decreed that the company's monopoly in supplying 18m mainly residential
customers should be ended in 1998.
Ms Claire Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general, said in presenting its
annual report yesterday that 'on many fronts we both have the same strategic
aims.'
The regulator's enthusiastic assessment of British Gas's attitude to
competition was in marked contrast to earlier reports, in which the company
came in for severe criticism.
Ms Spottiswoode conceded, however, that British Gas's new attitude to future
competition was based in large part on its desire to reduce the influence of
the regulator on its businesses.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Funds pressed on asset strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pension funds should broaden investment strategies away from equities to
reflect their rapidly increasing maturity, speakers told the Eastbourne
investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds
yesterday.
But Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, a member of the Goode Committee on pension law
reform, denied that any shift towards fixed-interest bonds and other less
risky assets should be blamed on his committee's recommendation of a minimum
solvency standard.
'It is the age of the scheme that dictates asset allocation and not the
minimum solvency standard,' said Mr Ross Goobey, who is the chief executive
of PosTel, the manager of the British Telecom and Post Office pension funds.
He said it was contradictory that consulting actuaries who were warning of
the impact of a solvency standard were also attempting to persuade clients
to pay for asset-liability studies which would highlight the need to invest
in less volatile assets.
A consultant, Ms Meredith Brooks, of Frank Russell, said too few pension
schemes were taking sufficient notice of changes in their liability
structure. 'In my experience, a lot of pension fund trustees are quite
intimidated by fund managers,' she said.
Mr Terry Webb, a former IBM pension fund manager now with RGB International,
said that, so far, the asset-liability studies undertaken by UK pension
schemes had seldom resulted in a substantial modification to the investment
policies.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Selling weakens unit trust levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors continued to pour money into unit trusts last month,
against a background of low interest rates, by investing a net Pounds 534m -
gross sales minus repurchases. However, heavy selling by institutions
reduced total net investment for January to Pounds 490m.
Both figures, issued yesterday by the Association of Unit Trust and
Investment Funds, are lower than December's, although the drop in retail
investment is only from Pounds 569m. Overall net investment was almost
halved from Pounds 895m. Private investors made net investments of Pounds
500m or more in August, October and December last year.
January's net retail investment represents a steep increase on January last
year, when private investors accounted for Pounds 112m of net sales. The
most popular retail funds last month were international growth and UK equity
income funds.
Repurchases in December from institutions, and to a lesser extent, private
investors, were high in the Far East, according to the association, which
attributed the reason to profit-taking after strong performance in the
region. The average Far East (excluding Japan) fund rose 86 per cent in
1993, according to HSW statistical information.
After falling out of favour in 1993, Japan became January's best-selling
fund with total net sales of Pounds 268m, of which Pounds 195m was due to
institutions and Pounds 73m from private investors.
Total gross sales of unit trusts last month were Pounds 1.94bn, and the
value of funds, at Pounds 99.9bn, was the highest recorded.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A committee sponsored by the Stock Exchange will today issue a code of
conduct instructing directors that they should no longer privately correct
individual analysts' profits forecasts but should inform the entire market,
Norma Cohen and Robert Peston write.
Institutional investors and stockbrokers which receive unpublished price
sensitive information will also be advised to encourage companies to publish
the information widely.
The new code has been drawn up so that companies, shareholders and
stockbrokers can be confident they can communicate with each other without
infringing the provision of the Criminal Justice Act on insider trading,
which comes into force on Tuesday.
It has been drafted by representatives of the 100 Group of Finance
Directors, the Institutional Fund Managers Association and the Association
of British Insurers.
One member said the committee was particularly concerned about earnings
forecasts from analysts employed by a company's own stockbroker which 'have
been surprisingly accurate'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Asian investors lead the way in Vietnam -
FT writers on those who beat the Americans to it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long before President Bill Clinton lifted the US trade embargo against
Vietnam earlier this month, Washington's Asian allies were investing and
trading enthusiastically with Vietnam and profiting from the growth
unleashed by economic reform after 1987.
US groups are likely to use their influence in sectors such as computers,
telecommunications, aerospace and oil exploration to challenge Asian and
European rivals already established in the country.
Taiwan and Hong Kong are the biggest foreign investors in Vietnam. Together
they have proposed more than Dollars 2.7bn worth of projects.
Taiwanese businessmen in particular benefit from their links to ethnic
Chinese businessmen in Cholon, the Chinatown of Ho Chi Minh City. Taiwan's
government is also keen to diversify offshore investment away from China.
Big Taiwanese players with joint ventures in Vietnam include the Ching Foong
conglomerate, the sole motorcycle assembler in the country, and food group
Ve Dan, which is investing Dollars 180m to produce monosodium glutamate,
instant noodles and drinks.
Hong Kong's Wharf Holdings, which this month opened the doors of its
260-room Omni Saigon hotel, managed to do so within 18 months of signing the
initial agreement with Japanese and Vietnamese partners.
However, with the return to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, some
Hong Kong companies are cautious about dealing with Vietnam because of the
long-standing hostility between Hanoi and Beijing.
It is Cable and Wireless, parent of Hongkong Telecom, rather than Hongkong
Telecom that is exploring the potential of the underdeveloped Vietnamese
market.
Also breaking into the telecommunications market is Hong Kong-listed ABC
Communications, whose paging service in Ho Chi Minh City is being augmented
with operations in Hanoi and Haiphong. Confronted by regulatory obstacles in
China, the group has sunk HKDollars 10m (Pounds 877,000) into Vietnam.
South Korean businesses, already among the biggest investors in Vietnam with
about Dollars 500m promised to Vietnamese projects, could increase their
investments with the end of the US embargo.
Seoul and Hanoi established diplomatic relations in December 1992, but South
Korean companies had begun investing in Vietnam in the late 1980s.
Medium-sized Korean textile and toy producers, interested in exploiting
Vietnam's low wage costs, have so far provided most of the investment.
Daewoo has been the most aggressive among the Korean conglomerates trying to
establish a firm foothold before the Japanese. 'We prefer to invest in
countries, such as Vietnam, where the Japanese are not dominant,' said Mr
Bae Soonhoon, president of Daewoo Electronics.
Daewoo is building a Dollars 35m joint venture motor vehicle assembly plant
in Hanoi, which will produce 10,000 cars, trucks and buses annually
beginning in 1995. It will soon begin operation of a Dollars 170m
joint-venture TV picture tube factory in Hanoi and has started construction
of a Dollars 134m business centre complex, including a 300-room hotel, in
the capital.
Hyundai is planning projects to build a container plant and a ship repair
yard and is considering establishing a car assembly plant. It also wants to
help construct a motorway linking Hanoi to Haiphong, and may seek offshore
oil exploration rights.
Samsung plans to construct a large chemical plant near Hanoi and is
negotiating a joint venture to produce medical equipment near Ho Chi Minh
City. Lucky-Goldstar is hoping to sell telecommunications equipment, such as
telephone exchanges, to Vietnam and plans to set up a consumer electronics
sales network.
Japanese companies, which were sensitive to US criticism and had not
previously been in the vanguard of the Asian investment rush into Vietnam,
have been busy catching up in the past two years.
New Japanese investment, negligible in 1988, increased to a peak in 1992 of
Dollars 220m, before falling back to Dollars 90m during the first 11 months
last year, according to Jetro, the Japan external trade organisation.
The big trading houses such as Nissho Iwai and Mitsui have been among the
most active. Mitsui, which exports machinery and chemicals to Vietnam and
sends out oil and prawns, expects to double its turnover in Vietnam this
year, although it refuses to give figures.
The end of the US embargo represented good and bad news, said Mr Yasuo
Ogawa, assistant general manager at Mitsui. The positive aspect was that it
allowed Japanese companies to set up joint-ventures with American groups;
the company had already teamed up with Unisys, the US computer group, to
tackle the Vietnamese market. The negative aspect was that competition would
intensify.
Mitsui has more than 20 projects in the pipeline. It already owns minority
stakes in a polyester and rayon factory, and a 240,000-tonne a year steel
plant costing Dollars 60m. It has put in bids to construct a container port
at Than Tuan, near Ho Chi Minh City and wants to construct a 60,000 tonnes a
year PVC plant. It is making a bid with British Gas and TransCanada to build
an offshore oil-field pipeline.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Clinton &amp; Co looks for business -
Administration is fighting for more foreign orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant, insists that it is just one of
several companies vying for a contract to be awarded next month to expand
Saudi Arabia's telecoms system.
However, it has one clear advantage: the commitment of the Clinton
administration to mobilise the resources of the federal government to help
US businesses compete aggressively for large overseas contracts.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, went twice to Saudi Arabia in pursuit of
last week's Dollars 6bn aerospace deal for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. He
also has made it clear that the administration will do 'everything possible'
to help AT&amp;T's bid succeed. 'The Saudis are adding 1.5bn new lines. That's
Dollars 4bn worth of business. The question is will NEC, Siemens or AT&amp;T get
it?' said Mr Brown.
Indicative of the administration's aim to capture large chunks of the
world's infrastructure business is its plan to establish a commerce
department advocacy centre. It will be along the lines of the 'war rooms'
set up in the Clinton presidential campaign and the fight to pass the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
The centre will co-ordinate all US government support on behalf of US
companies and mobilise resources and support for nearly 100 important
government procurement projects abroad. It will devise the same kind of
intense intergovernmental strategy for economic ends as the government does
for political and security objectives.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, commerce department undersecretary for trade, said
government advocacy would go beyond the usual representations by ambassadors
or visiting senior officials to making strenuous efforts 'involving
everything from financing to foreign policy pressure'.
Mr Garten is now in Asia in support of US telecommunications, aerospace and
energy companies and 'forming effective working relationships with
businesses on the ground'. He is seeking 'new ways to pursue commercial
partnerships' there, targeting particularly Indonesia and China, where
'hundreds of billions of dollars of new construction and rebuilding
contracts are being placed up for bidding'.
Mr Brown, his aides say, has already helped Motorola win a Dollars 100m
cellular telephone contract in Kuwait. He has his sights on other deals,
including telecommunications in China and fighter aircraft in Malaysia.
The Commerce Department is already developing strategic plans for each of
the 10 'big emerging markets' on which it has decided to focus its energies
 -Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Poland, South Korea,
South Africa and the Chinese Economic Area (including mainland China, Taiwan
and Hong Kong).
These markets are expected to provide 44 per cent of the world's new trade
opportunities over the next 20 years.
In line with that strategy, Mr Brown is planning next year to visit Asia
twice, and Latin America, South Africa and Russia.
An intensive effort to expand US trade and investment in Mexico is already
under way with the department's 'Export Mexico' campaign, which aims to
assist small and medium-sized companies into the market.

FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Canada cuts industrial input duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Competitive pressures on Canadian manufacturers caused by free-trade
agreements with the US and Mexico have led Ottawa to propose a unilateral
cut in customs duties on a wide range of industrial inputs.
One customs official estimated that about 1,500 items would be covered,
notably electronic and other components.
The cuts, announced by Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, in Tuesday's
federal budget, will be part of a sweeping three-year review of the tariff
structure by the Finance Department. That review is likely to include the
rounding out of decimal points in specific customs duties, elimination of
low 'nuisance' duties, and other measures to simplify and improve the
transparency of tariffs.
According to budget documents, the tariff structure has become increasingly
complex and costly to administer, partly as a result of multilateral
trade-liberalisation exercises, such as the recently concluded Uruguay
Round.
The 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and the recently implemented North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) have put many Canadian industries at a
disadvantage to US counterparts, which pay lower duties on raw materials,
parts and components imported from third countries.
The impact has been mitigated up to now by duty drawbacks, under which
customs duties are refunded on inputs used for goods which are eventually
exported. Under the US-Canada FTA and Nafta, however, drawbacks on goods
shipped to the US and Mexico are due to be eliminated on January 1 1996. The
US accounts for three-quarters of Canada's export trade.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union was accused yesterday by the US of acting in violation of
Gatt rules by imposing new restrictions on imports of white fish, following
recent violent protests by French fishermen.
At a meeting of Gatt's governing council, the US complained that in the wake
of French moves to disrupt fish trade the EU had 'unilaterally and, we
believe, illegally' notified trading partners of restrictions on fish
imports at prices below reference levels.
EU officials said the restrictions, which apply to white fish from all
sources, especially cod, haddock, coalfish, hake, monkfish and Alaska
pollack, were in response to a crisis in the fish market. The minimum import
price scheme, introduced on February 5 and due to end on March 15, was
designed to stabilise the market and prevent price declines.
Brazil took issue with US plans to subsidise 25,000 tonnes of soyabean oil
exports to China, which it said ran counter to the spirit of the accords
limiting agricultural export subsidies. The US said the amount was less than
2 per cent of China's total annual imports of vegetable oils.
Australia expressed concern the US might be tempted to make increased use
this year of its export subsidy scheme, the export enhancement programme, to
reduce farm surpluses before the Uruguay Round comes into effect.

<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho, the presidential peace envoy in Mexico's southern state
of Chiapas, has linked the resolution of the 54-day peasant uprising there
to national democratic reforms, in an apparent switch in strategy.
After publicly insisting that negotiations with the Zapatista rebels must
focus on economic and social problems in Chiapas, Mr Camacho seemed to join
with the rebels after the second day of talks in criticising Mexico's
political system. He agreed that democracy must play a part in a solution to
the uprising.
'Many of us want changes in the country. We want more democracy, more
freedoms and advances in justice,' he said 'The solution is a new treatment
for all indigenous communities in the country and a commitment to
democracy.'
Mr Camacho, known for his negotiating skills, may have changed his tone to
gain the trust and confidence of the Zapatistas before seeking concessions
from them. But he could be acting on behalf of President Carlos Salinas, who
in the past has used Mr Camacho to prepare the public for democratic
changes.
However, Mr Camacho is known to believe privately that electoral reform is
an essential condition for an agreement with the Zapatistas. Discussions
between the government and the opposition parties on democratic reforms have
recently stalled, and Mr Camacho may have been trying to press on the
governing party the importance of making the necessary political concessions
if it wants to solve the conflict in Chiapas.

FT  24 FEB 94 / IMF ready to relaunch special fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has at last collected enough promises of
money to relaunch its enhanced structural adjustment facility, a special
fund to lend money to low income countries at subsidised interest rates.
The Washington-based institution has gathered SDR4.5bn (Pounds 4.19bn) of
pledges for the ESAF capital account, on which donor countries will receive
interest, and SDR2bn of outright gifts, including SDR600m of its own
capital, for a separate subsidy account used to lower the interest rate
charged to borrower countries to 0.5 per cent.
This is a little short of the IMF's original target of SDR5bn for the
capital account and SDR2.1bn for the subsidy account, but the board has
decided to press ahead and make loans from the new ESAF.
IMF member governments have generally praised the work of the ESAF since it
was set up in 1987, but budget constraints have made it difficult to collect
the money needed to replenish the facility, virtually exhausted by the
authorisation of a SDR606.6m loan to Pakistan earlier this week.
The US promised a Dollars 100m gift in its budget earlier this month and now
Germany, the last major industrial country not to have contributed, has
pledged money for the capital account, though not the subsidy account.
Most countries that qualify for ESAF loans are in sub-Saharan Africa, but
the IMF board yesterday approved the addition of Armenia, Georgia,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Macedonia and Cameroon.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said yesterday he was especially
impressed by the contributions many developing countries have made to the
ESAF. The facility would play an important role in supporting economic
adjustment in francophone West Africa after the devaluation of the CFA franc
in January, he said.

FT  24 FEB 94 / US tempers outrage over spying: Christopher points up
broader interests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US yesterday maintained its tone of outrage over the arrest of an
alleged Russian spy at the Central Intelligence Agency, but officials made
clear that they had broader interests at stake in their relationship with
the government of President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the administration would
'take every measure to protect the US and to prevent such activities from
being carried out in the future'. He insisted, however, that Russia's
progress towards elective democracy and a market economy was more important
to the US's strategic interests.
'Events in Russia over the past few weeks have revived our fears about the
future. The dangers in Russia are very real, but I would want to emphasise
that these events should be put into perspective,' Mr Christopher told the
Senate committee on foreign relations.
US officials were certainly not under the illusion that the KGB's successor
agencies had entirely given up operations in the US, nor has the CIA stopped
spying in Russia.
Nevertheless, Monday's arrest of Mr Aldrich Ames, a senior CIA official,
makes it more difficult for the administration to argue publicly for large
sums of financial aid to Russia. Charges filed against him in a federal
court alleged that he continued spying for the Russian foreign intelligence
service, in return for a total of Dollars 1.5m, after the break-up of the
Soviet Union.
Senator Dennis DeConcini, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee,
called last night for a 60-day freeze on aid to Russia. 'We're handing over
Dollars 2bn to the Russians, and it seems to me it's not asking too much to
ask them to back off this kind of stuff,' he said.
Russia yesterday sought to play down the issue, pointing out that both
countries continued to spy on each other.
'It would be inappropriate to blow this story into a political scandal.
After all, intelligence, even in a changing world, remains intelligence,
with its own specific methods and interests,' Itar-Tass said.
'Nothing has changed,' said Mr Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first deputy director
of the External Intelligence Service recently. The latter was hived off from
the former KGB with the Soviet Union's collapse, while domestic operations
were concentrated in a new Security Ministry which in December was replaced
by the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service.
The Russian paymasters of Mr Ames and other spies were doubtless seeking the
same sort of information as most other intelligence agencies, with the added
suspicion that their former cold war enemy was seeking to make the most of
chaos in the former Soviet Union.
Russia's new weaknesses range from political instability, a loss of
water-tight borders as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse, and the
creation around it of a dozen new states, which Russia says are also spying
on it.
Without giving details, one Russian security source, obviously proud of the
public news of a Russian success in penetrating US intelligence, said
yesterday that Mr Ames had been an important agent.
Mr Ames's former role in counter-intelligence would have given him access to
sensitive details of the CIA's own agents in the former Soviet Union, as
well as to the CIA's efforts to ensure that it was not penetrated in turn by
the Soviet Union.
Nonetheless, US officials appear to be ready to smooth over the row so long
as Russia is willing to go through the motions of contrition.
Among other gestures, the US would like Russia voluntarily to withdraw those
of its diplomats who were involved with Mr Ames. It would also like Russia
to refrain from expelling the CIA's station chief in Moscow, which in the
cold war years would have been a traditional tit-for-tat measure.
Although the CIA is smarting over the discovery of a 'mole' so high in its
ranks, the case may help the agency make the case for preserving the US
intelligence budget, which has come under fire in Congress as overblown for
the post-cold war era.
Mr James Woolsey, director of central intelligence, has argued that the CIA
is needed more than ever both in tracking new threats such as terrorism or
nuclear proliferation, and in economic intelligence, which he has described
as 'the hottest current topic in intelligence policy'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Canadian business in cuts warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders and economists have warned that the financial markets'
confidence in Canada could be severely shaken if the Liberal government
fails to deliver big public spending cuts over the next 12 months.
The warnings tempered a mildly favourable response to the package of
restraint and tax-broadening measures contained in the new Liberal
government's first budget, tabled by Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, on
Tuesday. Markets showed little reaction to the budget yesterday.
Mr Martin projected a drop in the deficit from CDollars 45.7bn (Pounds
23.30bn) in the year to March 31 1994, to CDollars 39.7bn next year and
CDollars 32.76bn in 1995/96.
He promised longer-term reductions in next year's budget, following a review
of Canada's costly social security programmes and the system of transfers to
the 10 provinces. These two items plus subsidies make up 61 per cent of
Ottawa's total spending (excluding debt payments).
The Liberals, who came to office last November, have pledged to cut the
deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1997.
The projected drop in the deficit over the next two years is predicated
largely on a sharp rise in government revenues. But Mr Michael Manford,
chief economist at ScotiaMcLeod, said yesterday 'the only way that the
deficit is going to be materially reduced is by spending cuts.'
The concern centres on the continuing spiral in Ottawa's debt burden.
Despite the lower deficit, net debt is expected to rise from 67.6 per cent
of GDP in fiscal 1993 to 75 per cent in 1996. Almost a third of federal
revenues are channelled into debt-service payments.
Among tax loopholes closed by the budget are a CDollars 100,000 capital
gains exemption, and the ability of Canadian-based companies to avoid tax by
channelling income through foreign affiliates.
Spending cuts include the closure or consolidation of more than a third of
Canada's 60 military installations as part of a 12 per cent cut in defence
spending over the next five years.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Envoy backs reforms in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho, the presidential peace envoy in Mexico's southern state
of Chiapas, has linked the resolution of the 54-day peasant uprising there
to national democratic reforms, in an apparent switch in strategy.
After publicly insisting that negotiations with the Zapatista rebels must
focus on economic and social problems in Chiapas, Mr Camacho seemed to join
with the rebels after the second day of talks in criticising Mexico's
political system. He agreed that democracy must play a part in a solution to
the uprising.
'Many of us want changes in the country. We want more democracy, more
freedoms and advances in justice,' he said 'The solution is a new treatment
for all indigenous communities in the country and a commitment to democracy
in Mexico.'
Mr Camacho, known for his negotiating skills, may have changed his tone to
gain the trust and confidence of the Zapatistas before seeking concessions
from them. Alternatively he could be acting on behalf of President Carlos
Salinas, who in the past has used Mr Camacho to prepare public opinion for
democratic changes.
However, Mr Camacho is known to believe privately that electoral reform is
an essential condition for an agreement with the Zapatistas. Discussions
between the government and the opposition parties on democratic reforms have
recently stalled, and Mr Camacho may have been trying to press on the
governing party the importance of making the necessary political concessions
if it wants to solve the conflict in Chiapas.
Speculation has risen Mr Camacho is using the peace talks to lay out his own
agenda for democracy and establish his independence from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mr Camacho failed to win the party's
presidential nomination for this year's election, but is still thought to
have presidential ambitions.
The rebel spokesman sub-commander Marcos warned that if negotiations broke
down the Zapatistas would return to war. 'If peace is not dignified and
true, who will deny us the sacred right of living and dying like dignified
men and women? Who will impede us returning back to war and death?' he said.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday picked Ms Jamie Gorelick, general
counsel at the Pentagon, to be its new deputy attorney general.
Attorney General Janet Reno, who asked Mr Philip Heymann, her last deputy,
to leave because of different management styles, said Ms Gorelick was 'an
accomplished lawyer and a proven leader'.
The nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, and the 43-year-old
lawyer could face some hostility from conservative Republicans who have
complained about the way she handled them while at the defence department.
Ms Gorelick has already passed the confirmation hurdle once when she was
appointed to her Pentagon position. But, like Mr Strobe Talbott, who was
confirmed by the Senate this week as deputy secretary of state after some
rancorous debate, she could face greater difficulty in winning votes for
this more public post.
Nevertheless, her nomination is expected to be approved without too much
difficulty. She has considerable experience of the nomination process, since
she supervised not only the administration's defence nominees but also Ms
Reno's own confirmation hearings last year.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Fund managers face private trading curbs: Protecting US
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The firing of a senior fund manager for failing to report details of his
private share dealings has started a debate in the US mutual fund industry
over the widespread practice of managers trading their own share portfolios
while running large investment funds.
Mutual funds regulations may be tightened to ensure investors do not lose
confidence in the huge US fund industry.
There is no law against fund managers trading stocks for themselves while
managing their clients' money. They are required, however, to inform their
company when they do so. It is up to the company to ensure managers do not
conduct trades that benefit themselves at their customers' cost.
Such abuse includes illegal practices such as 'front running' (fund managers
buying shares for themselves before buying them for the fund), accepting
hidden fees from a company when they buy its shares for the fund, or
accepting favours from a client who does business with the fund (such as
being granted privileged access to private stock placements).
The firing in January of Mr John Kawecke, a successful and high-profile
money manager at the Invesco fund group, was not as a result of illegal
behaviour. He was accused of failing to report his personal trades to the
fund company.
Mr Kawecke's departure attracted a lot of attention because he was well
known in the industry and the publicity quickly led to revelations of
apparently similar cases at a number of leading fund companies.
A few days after Mr Kawecke was fired, for example, it was revealed that the
Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating personal trades by
employees of Fidelity, the country's largest fund group.
Other cases involving possible conflicts of interest in fund managers'
dealings were publicised, including the news that the Chicago-based
investment group Kemper had paid Dollars 9.8m in October to settle
government charges that one of its mutual fund managers had kept profitable
futures trades for an employee profit-sharing account while dumping
unprofitable trades into two of the firm's mutual funds.
Fund companies and politicians in Washington began to worry that investors
would start to lose confidence in the mutual fund industry. At the behest of
Congressman Edward Markey, the chairman of a House finance subcommittee, the
SEC launched a study into fund managers' trading activities.
The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry trade body, has
announced the launch of its own study into fund managers' personal share
dealings. Like the rest of the industry, it sees nothing wrong in fund
managers running their own portfolios. It is, and always has been, a common
practice.
'Most companies believe (allowing managers to run their own portfolios)
keeps them hungry, and ensures that they're paying attention to their funds.
It's a way of keeping people sharp,' says Mr Jim Coursey, a mutual fund
industry analyst who works for Morningstar, the Chicago-based financial
services and information firm.
However, Mr Stanley Sporkin, a Washington DC district court judge who led
the SEC's enforcement division during the 1970s, believes the industry
should, to eliminate all possible conflicts of interest, consider requiring
professionals to place their investments in a blind trust while they manage
mutual funds.
The debate has focused attention on the broader concern that the mutual fund
industry may have outgrown its regulatory framework. The industry's recent
growth has been dramatic. In 1980, just 6 per cent of all households owned
mutual funds worth Dollars 135bn. Today, 27 per cent of all households, or
almost 40m people, have more than Dollars 2,000bn invested in funds.
Although most observers believe the regulations are adequate, some
legislators are worried that the SEC, the chief regulator of mutual funds,
lacks the staff to enforce them properly.
The structure of the industry has also changed. Whereas once, only
investment firms and securities houses sold mutual funds, today commercial
banks are aggressively marketing in-house mutual funds to depositors.
Legislators fear that as banks become more involved in the securities
industry through mutual funds and other activities, regulators will find it
increasingly difficult to determine the safety and soundness of bank
finances. They also fear that customers may be buying mutual funds from
banks without realising that their investments, unlike the money in their
bank account, are not backed by a federal guarantee.
Congressman Markey would like to see banks conduct all their mutual fund and
other securities industry-type activities in separate corporate entities. He
also would like the SEC to take on more staff to regulate the fund industry,
and wants regulations governing the marketing of mutual funds by banks
tightened so that customers are fully informed about what they are buying.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first stage of governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms for Hong Kong
have won more support than expected after a marathon series of debates in
the colony's 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo).
The support for the governor's legislation was in defiance of China's
wishes. After last November's breakdown in Sino-British talks on the
colony's political development, Beijing warned that it would dissolve LegCo
on resumption of sovereignty in 1997 and hold fresh elections if LegCo voted
on the Patten package.
Mr Tam Yiu-chung, of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment
of Hong Kong, said the passage of the bill 'signifies that Britain has gone
down the road of no return.' He said that trust between the UK and China had
been 'totally shattered'.
The crucial vote was on a motion to defer consideration of the bill. This
vote, which was expected to be close, gave Mr Patten a majority of 13 and
improved on the majority of 11 he secured in November 1992 when LegCo first
voted on his democratic proposals. It paves the way for the publication
tomorrow of Mr Patten's second bill to broaden the democratic franchise in
Hong Kong.
LegCo members approved Mr Patten's plan to lower the voting age in Hong Kong
to 18, abolish appointments to local government, and institute popular
voting in the three tiers of government in the colony. LegCo also removed
the prohibition on Hong Kong delegates to People's Congresses in China
standing for election in the colony.
The normally polite atmosphere which pervades LegCo gave way to some
uncharacteristically robust parliamentary exchanges during the 10 hours of
debate. Anti-British feeling ran high in conservative circles.
Mrs Elsie Tu, an independent who tried to get Mr Patten's bill deferred,
said passage of the bill would only increase uncertainty about 1997. In 1997
the governor would be 'basking in the glory' of having introduced limited
democracy in Hong Kong but 'we in Hong Kong do not know what is in store for
us, we have to face 1997,' she said.
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said the passage of the bill
was a test of Hong Kong's ability to secure its high degree of autonomy as
promised by China in the 1984 Joint Declaration. 'It is important to
remember that Hong Kong's political arrangements and elections should not be
decided by Beijing - even after 1997,' he said.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Small is successful in a liberalised India: A new breed of
entrepreneurs making the best of a more open economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Packaging is my first love. You can wake me up at two o'clock in the
morning and I will talk about packaging,' says Mr Ashok Chaturvedi, a Delhi
businessman who has made his fortune out of plastic bags.
Mr Chaturvedi, who has three telephones on his desk and a radio telephone in
each of his three Mercedes cars, lives and breathes packaging. His smallest
bags are pouches for selling individual packs of tea, spices and shampoos.
His biggest are zip-locked sacks strong enough to take a tyre.
Flex, the group 38-year-old Mr Chaturvedi founded only 10 years ago, expects
to see sales rise 70-80 per cent in the year to June from Rs1.4bn (Pounds
30m) last year, with a similar increase next year. Mr Chaturvedi says:
'There's no limit. This is going to be the biggest flexible packaging
business in the world.'
Mr Chaturvedi is one of a new breed of Indian entrepreneurs that has been
quick to seize the opportunities created by the economic reforms started by
Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, in the mid-1980s, and greatly
extended under his successor Mr P V Narasimha Rao.
Free of the burdens which saddle many larger groups - such as over-manning,
out-dated plant and bloated corporate bureaucracies - younger companies are
showing how best to take advantage of liberalisation, notably in bringing
new technology into India and searching out export markets.
Mr Pradip Shah, managing director of Crisi, a credit rating agency, says the
opportunities created by reform often suit smaller companies better since
they require rapid responses. Mr Chaturvedi is more blunt: 'Reform can allow
the fast to move faster, but it cannot bring the dead back to life.'
The performance of small companies has yet to have much impact on national
industrial production figures which show India remains stuck in a
three-year-long recession, albeit with faint signs of recovery ahead.
However, high-growth pockets such as the southern edge of Delhi, the
engineering centre of Pune in western India, and the southern city of
Bangalore are seeing much higher rates of increase. All have fostered strong
communities of small companies.
Nowhere is this more visible than in Bangalore, which has long been a centre
for high-technology engineering, diversified into electronics and software
in the 1980s and is now moving into other advanced industries.
One such new-generation company is Biocon India, a biotechnology company
supplying enzymes for use in brewing, food-processing, textiles and other
industries.
Biocon's founder is Ms Karin Mazumdar, a qualified master brewer who started
the company at the age of 25 in 1979 after she failed to get a job in the
male-dominated brewing industry.
Like Mr Chaturvedi, she had little money of her own and began the business
in a garage with an investment of just Rs3,000. She persuaded Biocon
Biotechnology, an Irish enzyme maker, to take a stake in her company and to
transfer know-how.
Today Ms Mazumdar has annual sales of Rs165m, exports half her output and
employs 105 people, 25 of them scientists with advanced degrees.
'India,' says Ms Mazumdar, 'is the most cost-effective place in the world
for high-technology research. The salary of a good PhD-qualified researcher
is only Rs10,000 a month - a fraction of rates in the US.'
Ms Mazumdar says economic reform is bringing a big boost to her business
because it is forcing customers to become more competitive and up-grade
their products. 'Companies used to be so complacent. Now they are not.'
If biotechnology is one of India's newest industries, leather is one of its
oldest. But the opening of India's economy, especially the government's
export drive, has created fresh opportunities.
Mr Narayana Bhatt, a Bangalore lawyer, and his wife, Mrs Madhura Bhatt,
noticed in the 1970s that most traditional producers were tanners making
goods without paying much attention to fashion. Mrs Bhatt started making
high-fashion handbags in her garage. As the business grew, her husband
joined her and they diversified into leather coats and other garments.
Their company, Namaste Exports, expects to see sales of more than Rs1. bn in
the year to March, a 40 per cent increase on last year. Almost all the
output is exported.
Mr Bhatt, Namaste's chairman, says the biggest effect of reform has been to
transform attitudes to making money. 'Before, if you went into business
people said you were a selfish capitalist. Now we are free of that
thinking.'
Few Indian entrepreneurs can claim to have achieved as much as Mr
Chaturvedi, Ms Mazumdar and Mr Bhatt in so short a time. Failure is almost
as common as success among young businesses and many entrepreneurs spend
their lives just trying to break even. Moreover, the penalties for failure
in India are harsh - nearly every day, there are newspaper reports of
self-employed businessmen beaten or killed by loan sharks.
Yet, the odds are steadily improving in the entrepreneur's favour. Though Mr
Chaturvedi, Ms Mazumdar and Mr Bhatt's businesses were started well before
the latest phase of reform, the three founders agree that liberalisation has
greatly improved their prospects.
And they are all convinced that return to the pre-reform days of socialist
bureaucratic overkill is unthinkable. As Mr Bhatt says: 'We will never allow
things to go back. There are too many of us now.'

<TEXT>
The Vienna-based Inter-national Atomic Energy Agency yesterday urged North
Korea to issue entry visas to its inspectors as soon as possible. An IAEA
spokesman said the agency was 'dismayed' at the unexpected delay to a
programme of inspections agreed a week ago between the agency and Pyongyang.
'The content of the mission is not in dispute any longer. The scope and
objectives (of the inspections) have all been agreed. What is at issue is a
date and visas,' Mr David Kyd, an IAEA spokesman, said.
A team of IAEA inspectors was expected to begin inspections at seven North
Korean sites on Tuesday, but they have not been given visas.
North Korea has said issuing of visas would depend on the outcome of
bilateral discussions with the US, Mr Kyd added.
But the agency would not be formally referring the issue to the UN Security
Council. The council can impose sanctions against North Korea if it
continues to resist compliance with the 1969 nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.
The IAEA's board would send its latest status report on North Korea to the
UN.
North Korea announced last year it was withdrawing from the
non-proliferation treaty, but later relented. In recent weeks, it has again
threatened to pull out of the international safeguards system entirely.
US and North Korean officials are expected to meet today in New York to
discuss new demands by Pyongyang concerning international inspections.
In a meeting with the US yesterday, North Korea demanded Washington make a
written pledge on concessions, in return for Pyongyang allowing the IAEA
inspection team into the country, according to South Korean news agency
Yonhap.
The US promises would include suspending this year's US 'Team Spirit'
military exercise in South Korea and reopening high-level talks between
Washington and Pyongyang on possible US diplomatic recognition and economic
aid.
The US has already verbally agreed to carry out these measures if North
Korea lets in the IAEA inspectors and resumes talks with South Korea on
de-nuclearisation.
But disagreements still exist on the timing of the US steps and whether
Washington is willing to make these commitments in writing.

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Hu, Singapore's finance minister, yesterday unveiled a 1994
budget with modest tax relief and rebates for the country's 2.8m people
together with a range of incentives designed to improve competitiveness.
'We are at a turning point,' said Mr Hu. 'We have become a newly
industrialised eco-nomy. . . but Singaporeans must not be lulled into
thinking we have arrived and start relaxing and taking progress and
prosperity for granted.'
While Mr Hu said income tax rates would not be reduced, the unexpectedly
high 9.9 per cent economic growth figure for 1993 meant the government could
grant an across-the-board one-off rebate of 5 per cent. Rebates on housing
and rental charges were among a series of measures designed to offset the
impact of a 3 per cent general sales tax, to be introduced on April 1.
A 3 percentage point cut in corporation tax to 27 per cent was announced in
last year's budget. 'As the economy is expected to grow at a rate well above
the target range of 4-6 per cent, there is no need to adjust our tax rate
this year further to stimulate the economy.'
However, property tax rates would be progressively cut, with a 1 percentage
point reduction to 15 per cent this year, to reduce business costs and
increase Singapore's competitiveness in attracting foreign investments. Tax
incentives were also announced to encourage Singaporean business to invest
overseas.
But business costs within Singapore are likely to rise, with a 1.5
percentage point increase to 20 per cent in employers' contributions to the
central provident fund, the compulsory savings scheme.
Mr Hu said revenues were likely to exceed expenditure by SDollars 2.2bn
(Pounds 948m) in 1994. But he emphasised the need to increase economic
competitiveness and warned against any relaxation of the country's strict
spending policies.
'Government expenditure will continue to focus on areas that support and
promote economic growth for Singapore,' he added. 'We must avoid the
pitfalls of welfarism which, as the experience of socialist and western
democratic governments has shown, sooner or later leads to dependency and
destruction of the work ethic.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government, currently re-evaluating its nuclear policy, is
likely to suspend development of its controversial plutonium recycling
programme.
The decision is expected to be announced in June by the country's Atomic
Energy Commission, which has been assessing Japan's long-term nuclear policy
for the past 18 months.
The review would include delaying construction of a prototype fast breeder
reactor using plutonium as fuel and the launch of a plutonium processing
plant. It is a drastic change in stance by the Japanese government, which
has staunchly stood by its ambitious nuclear programme formulated in the
1950s.
Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, director in charge of Japan's nuclear policy at the
Science and Technology Agency, cited technical difficulties for the delay,
and said it had not abandoned its goal of becoming completely energy
self-sufficient through recycling nuclear fuel.
The shift comes amid mounting international criticism over its plutonium
recycling policy, stemming from concerns of nuclear proliferation and the
world's current excess supply of plutonium.
It also poses questions for Thorp, the UK plutonium reprocessing plant owned
by British Nuclear Fuels. Japanese electric utilities are Thorp's largest
clients and have shipped 2,300 tonnes of used nuclear fuel to Sellafield to
be processed.

<TEXT>
A former Vietnamese cabinet minister was sentenced by a Hanoi court
yesterday to three years' jail for corruption, at the end of a trial
designed to show the communist government's determination to crack down on
widespread bribery and fraud.
Mr Vu Ngoc Hai, 62, the former energy minister, and eight others were
convicted of embezzling some Dollars 300,000 (Pounds 166,000) while buying
steel for the building of a new electric power line linking north Vietnam
with the south. Mr Hai, who said he was innocent, was the highest-ranking
Vietnamese official to have been tried for corruption.
Corruption has spread rapidly since the Vietnamese government began
liberalising the economy in 1986, irritating foreign investors and angering
poorer Vietnamese citizens, who are often forced to pay bribes to civil
servants for routine transactions.
The government of prime minister Vo Van Kiet has made the fight against
corruption a priority, and the case of Mr Hai and his associates attracted
intense interest in Vietnam. The court was packed throughout the six-day
trial.
The power line project, aimed at bringing surplus electricity from the north
to the industries of the south, was sensitive because it could end up
costing double the estimated Dollars 300m because of delays, corruption and
poor planning. Protesting his innocence, Mr Hai said: 'I have been true to
the party for 48 years.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's main electronics manufacturers yesterday strongly criticised the
telecommunications ministry's surprise decision to review the country's high
definition television programme, saying they would continue to promote the
analogue HDTV system at present in use.
Mr Tadashi Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronics Industry Association of
Japan and president of NEC, said yesterday it was his firm belief that the
Japanese HDTV system, developed by the public broadcaster NHK and known as
Hi-Vision, would continue.
Hi-Vision was one of the few technologies Japan had developed on its own and
one which it could be proud of. 'If there is a better system, maybe we
should use that system, but there is no such system at present. Hi-Vision is
the only existing high definition TV system anywhere in the world,' he
declared.
Mr Sekimoto's remarks came in the wake of statements by a ministry official
supporting digital TV over Japan's currently-used analogue Hi-Vision.
Mr Akimasa Egawa, director general of the ministry's broadcasting
administration bureau, proposed that Japan promote a digital HDTV system in
order not to step out of line with the international trend towards digital
television. His remarks shocked the industry which has been selling
Hi-Vision sets, and has poured as much as Y1,000bn (Pounds 6.32bn) into
developing Hi-Vision, according to industry estimates.
It was in Japan's interests to continue developing Hi-Vision, Mr Sekimoto
added. The government, NHK and consumer electronics makers have together put
efforts into Hi-Vision broadcasting. Efforts will be made to extend
broadcasting time, increase software, and reduce the price.
Mr Sekimoto was joined in his defence of Hi-Vision by Mr Norio Ohga,
president of Sony, Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, and other
representatives of Japan's leading electronics companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy,
yesterday appeared to rule out immediate measures to calm the Chinese
economy which grew by 13 per cent last year and which shows little sign of
slowing.
Mr Zhu, who was speaking before leaving on a nine-day visit to Japan, voiced
concern about the possibility of social unrest should the government crack
down too hard on economic activity.
'China is aiming for fast, healthy and sustained economic growth and if the
rate of growth was forced down artificially, it would cause social
instability,' he said.
The Chinese official, who found himself at loggerheads with powerful
regional officials last year over a 16-point austerity programme, repeated
an official growth forecast for this year of 9 per cent.
But western economists doubt China will be abe to bring its rate of real GNP
growth down much below 10 per cent in 1994 without risking a 'hard landing'.
This is something Mr Zhu has said he wishes to avoid at all costs.
Mr Zhu predicted that China's rate of growth would be maintained at about 9
per cent for the next few years. He described prices in the first weeks of
this year as 'stable.''
Inflation has emerged as the biggest challenge to the authorities. Retail
prices (excluding services) rose by more than 15 per cent in December
compared with a year earlier.
The cost of living for 35 major cities increased by 24 per cent in the 12
months to December, with the cost of services increasing sharply - by 38 per
cent compared with the rate of 16.5 per cent for consumer goods.
Officials of the State Statistical Bureau were quoted yesterday as saying
that 'inflation. . . still posed a threat to the sustainable and healthy
growth of the national economy.'
Many state enterprises are close to bankruptcy, starved of funds and beyond
producing marketable products.
Mr Zhu's lengthy visit to Japan indicates a warming of the business
relationship. Japanese companies had been wary of investing in China, but
sentiment appears to be changing.
Two-way trade reached Dollars 37.8bn (Pounds 21bn), with Chinese exports to
Japan totalling Dollars 20.5bn and imports Dollars 17.2bn.

Israel has sent word to Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir
Arafat that it plans to complete its military pull-out from the Gaza Strip
and the Jericho area of the West Bank by the third week in May, government
officials said yesterday.
Earlier this week, the Israeli environment minister, Mr Yossi Sarid, said
that, by late May, he expected Mr Arafat to relocate from Tunis to a new PLO
headquarters in Jericho.
The Israeli officials spoke as Israeli-PLO peace talks, bogged down in
arguments over the minutiae of Palestinian self-rule, appeared to be moving
into high gear. Israel's Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said agreement
had been reached on the size of the Palestinian police force, 'plus or minus
8,000 for the Gaza and Jericho stage.'
Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said he believed the original
April 13 target date for completing the Israeli withdrawal would not be
missed by more than two or three weeks. Sometime in the spring, he said,
'we'll be able to celebrate a task completed'.
In Cairo, Israel and the PLO agreed to reconvene next week for further talks
on the police force, other security arrangements and civil administration
issues related to the transfer of power. The PLO's delegation head, Mr Nabil
Sha'ath, and his Israeli counterpart, Maj-General Amnon Shahak, expressed
satisfaction at progress made. The release of Palestinian prisoners remained
under discussion. 'But only a little is left to do,' Mr Sha'ath stated.
He believed agreement had been reached on rules of conduct and deployment of
a Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho after Israeli withdrawal. He
has spoken of a meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin as early as next
weekend to wrap up final issues. Mr Beilin said such a meeting was 'not far
off'.
Talks in Paris on the economic aspects of Palestinian autonomy have stalled
because of disputes over the future trading relationship between Israel and
the areas under Palestinian self-rule. The Palestinians want their own
currency and an independent foreign trade policy. Israel rejects the
currency demand.

The Bank of Spain yesterday followed up a quarter-point cut in its daily
intervention rate at the end of last week by lowering its benchmark rate
from 8.75 per cent to 8.50 per cent at its 10 day repurchase tender for
central bank certificates. The move disappointed some analysts who had hoped
for a half-point cut but it reflected caution by the authorities after
higher than expected price increases in January which put annualised
inflation at 5 per cent. Markets still expect the benchmark rate to be down
to around 7 per cent by the end of the year.
Italy's industrial output fell 2.8 per cent last year against a 0.6 per cent
fall in 1992. Output fell in the first three quarters, but rose 0.2 per cent
in the final quarter. Dutch consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent year-on-year
in volume in the fourth quarter of 1993, and by 0.8 per cent over the whole
year, against a rise of 2.1 per cent in 1992.
French household spending on manufactured goods was up 1.4 per in January
this year over last year. In December, 1993, consumer spending was 3.9 per
cent below December 1992.

Madrid's conservative city council has reacted angrily to a survey
suggesting its pavements are the most dog-fouled in Europe, although the
same survey said Madrid's Atocha station was Europe's cleanest, writes
Bronwen Maddox. The comparison of nine European capitals by the Tidy Britain
Group, a London-based charity campaigning against litter, ranked London as
the cleanest city and Athens the dirtiest. Amsterdam had the most graffiti,
Rome the most fly-posting and Berlin the most vandalism. Paris's Boulevard
Haussmann was ranked Europe's dirtiest shopping street. The councillor in
charge of cleaning Madrid said the report was biased, that Berne was much
cleaner than London and that Amsterdam was dirtier than Madrid.

<TEXT>
The resignation of seven Ukrainian generals, reported yesterday, is raising
questions about the country's security as the army - the second largest in
Europe - descends into financial disarray and personnel squabbles, writes
Jill Barshay in Kiev. The generals resigned in protest at lack of
consultation by President Leonid Kravchuk when he appointed a new air force
chief. In an effort to persuade Ukraine to rely not on nuclear weapons, but
on conventional forces for its security, the west has been eager to bolster
the Ukrainian army. But creating a swift battle-ready, defensive army out of
the remnants of the old Soviet military machine has not been easy for the
financially troubled two-year-old nation.
While former defence minister Mr Konstantin Morozov is widely praised for
rapidly establishing a Ukrainian army on the heels of the Soviet Union's
collapse, its leadership is politicised and divided. The ranks are poorly
organised and there is little money to train soldiers properly. Last week in
Ukraine's military newspaper, Narodna Armia, senior generals complained that
the 650,000 troops had received less than 10 per cent of their pay.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Croats and Moslems agree Bosnia truce: Washington and Moscow
join in diplomatic drive to lay groundwork for a wider peace plan

Bosnian Croats and Moslems agreed a ceasefire yesterday as the US, Russia
and western Europe pressed ahead with efforts to lay the basis for peace in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The ceasefire, to start at 11 am GMT tomorrow, was announced by Mr Yasushi
Akashi, the United Nations envoy. It was agreed at UN-sponsored talks in
Zagreb between Mr Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army, and
Mr Ante Roso, the Bosnian Croat military chief.
The accord appears a success for international efforts to build on the peace
arrangements for Sarajevo, where the threat of Nato air strikes combined
with Russian pressure has led to withdrawal of Serb artillery.
The Croats and Moslems agreed all heavy weapons would be handed over to UN
troops or withdrawn from battle fronts. Mortars will be pulled back 10km
from front lines, and tanks and heavy artillery 20km. UN troops will move in
to ensure compliance. If the truce holds in central Bosnia, it could pave
the way for lifting the Croat siege of Mostar, in western Hercegovina.
In their latest efforts, Washington, the UN, the European Union and Russia
are engaging in a three-pronged strategy aimed at creating a new peace plan
for Bosnia-Hercegovina, according to diplomats.
Under this strategy mediators are pressing for firm ceasefires in certain
regions, allowing unhindered access for humanitarian aid convoys and
eventual demilitarisation of the areas. But diplomats said success would
depend on a western commitment to send more peacekeepers to Bosnia - for
which omens are not good.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, and Mr Charles Redman,
US special envoy, held talks in Zagreb yesterday with Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, the international peace negotiators. The talks
centred on Croatia and the Bosnian government agreeing to an eventual
'confederation' for Bosnia, following a ceasefire in central Bosnia and
lifting of the siege of Mostar.
US officials had hoped Germany would play a greater role in persuading
Croatia to pull its troops out of western Hercegovina. Mr Mate Granic,
Croatia's foreign minister, said yesterday Zagreb had withdrawn about 1,200
troops from western Hercegovina. But US officials said the pressure from
Bonn was not enough.
'It might be in the interests of the Moslems to sign up to a confederation,'
a Belgrade-based diplomat said. 'If not, they will be left with an unviable
state. If they are to have any hope of survival, the Moslems must make a
deal with either the Serbs or the Croats.'
This is where Washington's role is crucial, as part of the second prong to
the strategy. US and European leaders have told Bosnian president Alija
Izetbegovic they will help postwar reconstruction in an effort to win Moslem
endorsement of the diplomatic peace initiative. But Mr Izetbegovic is cool
largely because Croatia still refuses to withdraw its troops.
The third element involves the Russians, who can put pressure on the Serbs.
'Trying to coalesce these three elements of the strategy will be difficult,'
a British diplomat said, adding that pressure to capitalise on involvement
by Moscow and Washington must not be squandered.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday proposed an international summit
on Bosnia - an idea welcomed with caution by western nations.

in efforts to widen ceasefire and get unhindered access for aid convoys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia are embarking on a
three-pronged strategy aimed at creating a new peace plan for
Bosnia-Hercegovina, western diplomats said yesterday.
The strategy, which coincides with talks between Bosnian and Croat military
leaders in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, involves diplomats concentrating
on certain regions in Bosnia with the aim of securing ceasefires, allowing
the unhindered access of humanitarian aid convoys, and the eventual
de-militarisation of these areas.
However, diplomats said the crucial success of any plan involves a
commitment by western governments to send many more peace-keepers to
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The omens are not good: a request by Gen Sir Michael
Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, for an extra 3,000 troops for Sarajevo has not
yet been met.
'We now have to apply pressure. But this must be underpinned by carrots and
sticks to all three sides,' a US diplomat said.
Yesterday, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, and special
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, and Mr Charle Redmon, US special envoy, held
talks in Zagreb with Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, the
international peace negotiators.
The talks centre on Croatia and the Bosnian government agreeing to an
eventual 'confederation' for Bosnia, and in the short term, securing
ceasefires in central Bosnia and lifting the Croat siege of the city of
Mostar in western Hercegovina.
US officials had hoped Germany would play a greater role in persuading
Croatia to pull its troops out of western Hercegovina. Yesterday, Mr Mate
Granic, Croatia's foreign minister, who held talks in Bonn with Mr Klaus
Kinkel, his German counterpart, said Zagreb had withdrawn about 1,200 troops
from western Hercegovina. But US officials said the pressure from Bonn was
not enough.
The White House indicated an agreement between the Croats and Moslems might
be a way in isolating the Bosnian Serbs who often fight alongside Bosnia's
Croats against the Moslem forces. But Serbia and Croatia share the same aim:
the eventual annexation of parts of western Hercegovina to Croatia and
eastern Bosnia to Serbia at the expense of the Bosnian Moslems.
'It might be in the interests of the Moslems to sign up to a confederation.
If not, they will be left with an unviable state. If they are to have any
hope of survival, the Moslems must make a deal with either the Serbs or the
Croats,' said a diplomat based in Belgrade.
This is where Washington's role, as part of the second prong to the
strategy, is crucial. US and European leaders have told Mr Alija
Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, that they will help with post-war
reconstruction in an attempt to win Moslem endorsement for the new
diplomatic peace initiative. But Mr Izetbegovic is cool to the plan largely
because Croatia still refuses to withdraw its troops from Bosnia. The third
element involves the Russians who are in a position to put pressure on the
Serbs.
'Trying to coalesce these three elements of the strategy will be difficult,'
a British diplomat said, adding that the pressure to capitalise on
involvement by Moscow and Washington must not be squandered.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Pensions reform plan unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A plan to create a French system of private capitalised pension funds, which
draws from the British and German systems, was unveiled by Mr Jacques
Barrot, chairman of the National Assembly's finance committee, yesterday.
The plan proposes that new pension funds should be managed independently but
be allowed to invest part of their capital in contributing companies. Mr
Barrot's proposals will form a basis for negotiations in the government's
plan to reform its creaking pension system.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, has said he plans to introduce a
bill on pension reform in the spring. The government is seeking to ease
pressure on the existing 'pay as you go' state system, which has a deficit
of almost FFr20bn (Dollars 3.34bn) as a result of France's ageing population
and rising unemployment.
By creating a system of powerful private pension funds, the French
government hopes to promote the development of France's financial markets.
In the UK and the US, pension funds are some of the largest investors on the
stock market.
Mr Barrot recommends pension funds should invest at least 30 per cent of
employer contributions into the company which employs them.
He said funds should also pay out pensions solely in life annuities rather
than in capital and they should invest at least half of their assets in
shares.
According to Mr Barrot, this system strikes a balance between the UK system,
in which pension funds are run independently, and the German system, where
companies make provisions for pensions in their balance sheets.
Under the proposals, contributions to pension funds should receive tax
exemptions. Industry analysts estimated this could entail costs of
FFr15bn-FFr20bn to establish a system of capitalised pension funds.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Utilities could sue over reactor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, acknowledged yesterday that
the government could be sued for up to FFr18bn (Pounds 2bn) by French,
Italian and German utilities as a result of its decision to use their
Superphenix fast breeder reactor for research into nuclear waste rather than
producing electricity.
Explaining the government's controversial decision, Mr Longuet said: 'There
is no good financial solution to this problem - stopping the reactor costs
money, starting it costs money.' He said France was not abandoning its lead
over other countries in fast breeder reactor technology, but for the time
being it was more important to use the Superphenix for research into
destroying plutonium waste than creating it.
Superphenix was conceived in the 1970s, and commissioned in 1986, to produce
more plutonium byproduct than it took in from French nuclear power stations,
in order to make France self-sufficient in nuclear fuel. But the subsequent
fall in uranium prices, availability of plutonium from de-commissioned
Russian nuclear weapons and the growing problem of plutonium waste from
France's 56 reactors have pursuaded the French government to try to turn
Superphenix into a destroyer, not a creator of plutonium.
Last month the French nuclear safety inspectorate said Superphenix, shut
down since a July 1990 accident, coud be restarted, but only at low power
and provided work on its sodium cooling system was finished. This decision
appeared to have forced the government's hand, because the three partners in
the Nersa consortium which runs Superphenix - Electricite de France, Enel of
Italy and SBK of Germany - might have sued it for continuing the shutdown on
political grounds.
But anticipating unhappiness among the Nersa partners that they now face no
prospect of generating electricity from the reactor for some time, Mr
Longuet said he hoped they would stay in the consortium to draw useful
research from Superphenix's new use as a waste disposal prototype.
Dismantling the reactor entirely would cost the consortium FFr8-10bn in
addition to losing them their original FFr278bn in the ill-fated plant, Mr
Longuet said.
EdF and Enel yesterday said they were still considering their reaction to
the government decision. Ministers could put no figure on the cost of the
new research programme, but said the CEA, the French atomic energy
authority, would bear much of the research costs itself.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Paris makes European security ambitions clear: Long-awaited
policy goes against the trend among allies towards retrenchment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's defence white paper published yesterday is designed
to set military policy for 15-20 years. That is perhaps why its 159 pages
make no explicit mention of the Bosnian crisis, which Paris obviously hopes
will be over long before then.
French ambitions to play a leading, even the leading, part in future
European security arrangements shine through right from the start. In the
foreword, Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, says 'France must set an
example, not in a 19th century-style concert of powers, but in 'Europe'',
while Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, asks his countrymen to make 'the
necessary efforts by which France will play a major role in building a
common European defence'.
After working wordily through all the uncertainties and risks in post-cold
war Europe, the paper concludes that 'France will maintain its effort' well
into the next century. That is a radical conclusion, at a time when
virtually all its allies are sharply paring their military spending.
Yet France has gone 22 years without a defence white paper. So why one now?
One reason has to do with domestic politics - Mr Balladur's desire to
encroach on President Francois Mitterrand's constitutional prerogative on
defence, and in the words of one white paper committee member 'to gather the
strategic community around the prime minister' in preparation for Mr
Balladur, or another Gaullist like Mr Jacques Chirac, winning next year's
presidential election.
Mr Mitterrand's role in the paper's preparation has been largely passive. It
had to have his approval, but he confined himself mainly to resisting
conservative attempts to undermine his moratorium on French nuclear weapon
tests, and to make France's nuclear deterrent more 'useable' by calling for
design of smaller, cleaner weapons.
The other motive is to preserve the famous French consensus on defence in
the post-cold war world. The 1972 white paper defined French security in a
geographically narrow and nationalist way, to be defended by French forces
operating semi-detached from Nato or any other allies. As such, it won
remarkable public support.
The dangers are now different and more diffuse, but, the paper argues, no
less real to France in that they affect the whole European Union into which
France is increasingly embedded.
It marks Germany and Britain out as key partners. France wants to see
Germany throw off its constitutional and political inhibitions to playing a
wider military role in Europe, while with Britain 'the level of our
co-operation must be significantly raised' because the two countries
'possess relatively important capacity for external action' and 'the will to
use it'. But the paper also points to the military and defence potential of
Italy, Spain, and Sweden.
Far from expressing any animus against Washington or Nato, the paper
acknowledges the US as today's 'only military giant' and the alliance as
'the principal organisation of defence'. France will not go back on its 1966
withdrawal from Nato's integrated command, but the paper puts on the record
that French defence ministers and chiefs of staff will attend Nato meetings
on a case-by-case basis, particularly when peacekeeping operations are
involved.
The goals which the white paper sets for the Balladur government's
forthcoming framework law for military spending over the 1995-2000 period
are:
Maintaining the nuclear deterrent and filling gaps in conventional forces
such as intelligence-gathering, logistics and air transport. The ability to
transport some 120,000-130,000 troops and equipment overseas, let its
113-ship navy fall to no fewer than 100, and keep 20 squadrons in its air
force.
Continue to build its own nuclear weapons and maintain an autonomous
capability in such technologies as electronic warfare, stealth weaponry and
intelligence. But apart from this, 'there is no area in which France cannot
share with other European countries'.
This clearly means more arms co-operation with EU partners. The paper
foreshadows a joint arms agency with Germany which Paris wants to set up at
this summer's Franco-German summit, and again it contains a note of the
frustrated suitor with Britain 'whose research and industrial potential is
most comparable to ours'.

FT  24 FEB 94 / France maps out military strategy into next century: White
paper aims to preserve public consensus on defence and quash any notion of a
'peace dividend'

<TEXT>
The French government pledged itself to an ambitious defence policy, working
in greater co-operation with its European and Nato allies, in a white paper
designed to map out French military strategy into the next century.
The dual purpose of the long-awaited white paper, according to a senior
defence official, was to preserve the French public consensus on defence in
the uncertainties of the post cold war world, and to 'torpedo the idea that
France can reap a peace divided'.
It is designed to lay the ground for a framework law later this year on
military spending in the 1995-2000 period.
In their foreword to the white paper, Mr Francois Leotard, the defence
minister, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said France should
'set an example to Europe' which, while preserving its Nato link to the US,
'could not leave its defence to others'.
But both men were earlier drawn into a clash with their fellow conservative
Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist mayor of Paris who at a meeting on Tuesday
criticised the government for buckling under to Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand's insistence that the white paper implicitly endorse his April
1992 freeze on French nuclear weapon tests in the south Pacific.
The argument has injected further tension into the rivalry between Mr Chirac
and Mr Balladur for the gaullist nomination in next year's presidential
election.
The white paper merely endorses the compromise between the Balladur
government and Mr Mitterrand for a new programme of simulated nuclear tests.
France, which alone among the principal western countries has actually
increased its spending on military equipment slightly this year, 'must
maintain its effort, says the white paper.
In addition to keeping the country's nuclear deterrent, the white paper
calls for improvements in French conventional forces in areas like
intelligence-gathering, logisitics and air trans-port.
The white paper stresses that Germany and Britain are France's key partners
in a stronger common European defence, as set out in the Maastricht treaty,
as well as in more industrial co-operation in arms manufacture.
As for French forces, it says that France should be able to transport up to
130,000 men and their equipment to overseas trouble spots, keep a navy of
100 ships and an air force of 20 squadrons of aircraft.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, yesterday warned the European
car industry that Brussels would not protect it indefinitely from Japanese
competition.
He said there would be no change to the EU-Japan agreement on market access,
signalling that the commitment to open the EU market by the end of 1999 must
stand.
But he held out the prospect of a substantial aid package to help
restructuring and hinted that he expected to see further mergers along the
lines of the Rover-BMW deal.
Unveiling a Commission strategy paper on the future of the European car
industry, Mr Bangemann said: 'We are not advocating mergers, (but) we do
believe that not all the European car industry have the necessary size to
compete in the world market.'
He urged European car makers to target emerging markets in the Far East and
Latin America for both sales and production. The commission is pushing for
better market access for EU car exports in Japan, US, South Korea, East
Europe and Turkey.
The agreement struck between Japan and the EU in July 1991 envisages the
progressive opening of European markets to Japanese imports by 2000,
allowing Japanese exporters to increase market share when the European
market is growing.
The Commission report calls for measures to tackle the structural weakness
in the European car industry including:
Allocating EU funds for retraining workers, with up to Ecu4bn of EU funds
potentially available.
Developing joint programmes of research and development, with Ecu1.3bn of
funds likely to be earmarked between 1994 and 1998.
New measures to smooth the operation of the internal market, such as
streamlining the distribution system and harmonising vehicle taxes.
Introducing a range of environmental standards, aimed at promoting cleaner
and more efficient cars.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans van den Broek, EU foreign affairs commissioner, will today attempt
to break the impasse in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia which has
triggered a political crisis in the European Union.
The Dutch commissioner will present a letter from President Kiro Gligorov of
Macedonia to Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek socialist prime minister,
offering to renew a dialogue with Athens over the disputed use of the name
Macedonia.
Last week, Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, ordered a
partial trade embargo against the former Yugoslav republic. The ban left
Athens isolated and blew a hole in the common foreign policy foreseen in the
Maastricht treaty. Belgium joined the US and six other EU member states
yesterday in recognising Macedonia.
Mr van den Broek's mission offers a slender hope of defusing the diplomatic
dispute which centres on Greek claims that Macedonia's name, flag and
constitution amount to a territorial claim on its own province of the same
name.
Mr van den Broek said yesterday that two hours of talks with President
Gligorov had been 'very intense and productive'. He declined to reveal
contents of the letter, but Macedonian officials said it offered to renew a
dialogue under the aegis of the EU and the UN.
In Brussels, there is some concern that Mr van den Broek's political mission
could conflict with the Commission's legal role as guardian of the Treaty of
Rome. Officials are irritated by Greece's delay in offering a written legal
defence of last week's trade embargo, especially as it holds the rotating EU
presidency.
On Tuesday, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, set in motion steps to
take Greece to the European Court on the grounds that the embargo violates
the treaty's requirements for the free circulation of goods and for a common
external trade policy.

FT  24 FEB 94 / BT plans 'superhighway' services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is set to announce a massive investment programme
aimed at creating 'information superhighways' capable of delivering a range
of inter-active video, banking and shopping services into homes across the
country.
The investment programme, the largest since the introduction of digital
exchanges in the mid-1980s, could involve replacing much of BT's local
'copper wire' networks with fibre-optics.
Estimates suggest the total outlay could exceed Pounds 10bn over more than a
decade, although large-scale investment would be unlikely to start for at
least three years. Dr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development and
procurement, told the FT yesterday an announcement about extending
fibre-optics to BT's local network was likely 'in the next few months.
'What we really want to do is to deliver services on demand - not just
video. We believe there is a much broader range of services which could be
delivered.'
As well as videos, shopping and banking, he cited estate and travel agency,
travel and holiday services and health and educational programmes as
important markets.
'There is no way we could justify an investment of this kind on just one
service,' he said, adding that the step required 'vision' but was little
different in kind from that taken for digitalisation in the early 1980s when
the costs 'looked horrendous'.
Most of BT's long-distance network is already fibre, but most of its local
network is copper, which has limited transmission capacity. Dr Rudge said BT
might be able to take fibre right into the home - not just to street level -
if the cost of the necessary electronics continued to fall.
BT's move comes on the back of similar announcements by US and Japanese
operators, who see consumer and public sector markets, not just business
demand, for new inter-active services. Last April NTT, the Japanese domestic
operator, announced plans to invest Dollars 396m to install fibre to all
subscribers by 2015.
Most of the US regional Bell operators have plans to extend fibre into their
local networks. Ameritech, which has 12m customers in the Midwest, last
month announced plans for a 'digital video network' extending to half its
network by the end of the decade. US West, which covers 14 western states,
earlier this month announced plans to build a hybrid fibre and coaxial
network.
BT hopes soon to offer a video service over existing copper wire, using
technology about to be piloted at Colchester in Essex.
But Dr Rudge said copper-based methods were only 'an interim solution'. Last
night BT said an initial trial with fibre-optics would take place in the
spring using the homes of 60 BT employees at Kesgrave, near Ipswich.
If it proved successful, the experiment would be extended to 2,500 BT
customers around the country, possibly in the autumn. The system might then
be introduced nationwide.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Honda set to revise all Rover contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honda intends to continue all its current projects with the Rover group,
despite its decision to sever its equity link with the UK carmaker.
But it has told BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker which is
acquiring Rover from British Aerospace, that it wishes to renegotiate all
the existing Honda/Rover contracts in the light of the change of ownership
of the UK carmaker.
The Japanese carmaker is expected to seek a significant increase in its
licensing royalties and components prices as the price for it continuing the
series of licensing agreements and components supply deals which underpin
more than two-thirds of Rover's current car production. The renegotiation
would involve the Rover 200, 400, 600 and 800 series, and threatens to
reduce the profitability of the Rover business, which returned to an
operating profit last year after two years of losses.
Honda supplies around 8 per cent of Rover's total materials and components
purchasing.
It is understood that the assurance that the Japanese carmaker intended to
continue all 'present and presently planned projects' was given by Mr
Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, when he met Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW
management board chairman on Monday.
Publicly Honda has said only that it intended to withdraw from its 20 per
cent equity holding in the Rover vehicle operations.
The assurance appears to calm fears that the BMW takeover of Rover - BMW is
paying Pounds 800m and assuming Rover group net debt of Pounds 200m and
off-balance sheet funding of Pounds 700m - could lead to significant
disruption of production at Rover's UK plants.
BMW believes that the Honda assurance also means that the Japanese carmaker
will press ahead as planned with the so-called HH/Theta project to develop a
new generation of cars to replace the current Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto
sister cars.
This project is already well advanced, and the Honda version of the new car
is due to enter production in the autumn at the Japanese carmaker's plant at
Swindon, Wiltshire. Rover will start production of its version of this
family car shortly afterwards at its Longbridge, Birmingham, plant.
Many components suppliers to Honda and Rover are at an advanced stage in
preparing to supply parts for this new car range - the most important volume
car in the Rover line-up - and any delay would have been disruptive to them.
While Honda is expected to adopt a tough stance in the contract
renegotiations, BMW will be able to use the lever that the Rover business is
also a profitable part of the Japanese carmaker's operations.
Rover is thought to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 100m to
Honda. BMW's purchase of Rover should be complete by mid-March.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Yeltsin faces showdown over coup plotters: Aides suggest
Russian president will ignore parliament's order to pardon rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin was moving towards a possible showdown with the new
Russian parliament after it voted yesterday to pardon the organisers of last
October's armed rebellion and the leaders of the 1991 coup.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, described
parliament's decision as 'ruinous politicking'. It had 'failed to draw
lessons from the bitter experience' of last October when parliament was
blasted by Mr Yeltsin's tanks.
Reformers in parliament said the move was a step towards civil strife and
threatened the destabilisation of Russia. Presidential aides suggested
parliament's order would be ignored.
The vote came on the eve of a state of the nation speech Mr Yeltsin is due
to make to parliament today. If he goes ahead with the speech, it will end
weeks of presidential silence after last December's election triumph of
communists and ultra-nationalists and the announcement by Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, prime minister, of 'corrections' to Mr Yeltsin's bold market
reforms.
One presidential aide urged Mr Yeltsin not to make the speech.
But officials said two of the president's advisers were last night working
on last minute changes to the draft in reaction to parliament's moves.
The resolution, which was adopted in parliament by 253 votes to 67, ordered
the immediate release from prison of Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former
vice-president who launched last October's armed uprising, and dozens of
others, including those who launched the 1991 coup attempt against then
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Drafted by Mr Victor Illyukhin, a Communist who once tried to sue Mr
Gorbachev for allegedly causing the break-up of the Soviet Union, the
resolution was described by supporters as a step towards national
reconciliation.
It confronts Mr Yeltsin with a dramatic choice. Either he defies an order he
has no constitutional right to veto, because it is a resolution and not a
law, or he can try to compromise with parliament, risking the possibility of
being forced to resign or to call early elections.
Mr Sergei Yushenkov, an organiser of Russia's Choice, the anti-Communist
alliance of loyal presidential supporters whom Mr Yeltsin failed to support
in the December parliamentary elections, said the resolution was 'a
declaration of civil war'.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the parliamentary leader of Russia's Choice, said Mr
Yeltsin 'has no right to veto this extremely dangerous decision' and said he
was 'absolutely convinced that this is a step towards destabilisation in
Russia'.
Scenting blood, Mr Gennady Ziuganov, the Communist leader who says he wants
to turn his party into a social democratic organisation, advised Mr Yeltsin
to resign.
The resolution provides an amnesty for all the participants, whether
convicted or not, of the October 1993 uprising and the August 1991 coup, as
well as bloody attacks on police by Communists and nationalists last May
Day.

FT  24 FEB 94 / France says'Non' to creeping franglais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Balladur government yesterday stepped up its counter-offensive against
the incursions of English by announcing that it is considering legislation
to make the use of French compulsory in public advertising, announcements
and conferences, on radio and television and in work contracts.
The government has not yet decided what penalties to impose for the use of a
foreign word where a French equivalent exists and officials suggest the most
likely sanction would be removal of any public subsidy from the offending
organisation. The possibility of fines and even prison sentences has
apparently not been ruled out.
Considered in cabinet yesterday, the language bill will this spring go to
parliament, where last December deputies showed that, if anything, they were
more exercised than the government about the dilution of French culture.
MPs passed into law a requirement that by January 1996 all French radio
stations must bring the percentage of French songs in the music they
broadcast up to 40 per cent. That followed France's successful and
domestically popular attempt to prevent quotas for French films being
negotiated away in the Gatt talks, as the US had insisted.
Recently the legislators became a target when the secretary of the Academie
Francaise, guardian of the purity of the French language, complained to the
president of the National Assembly that MPs were using slipshod and improper
French in their debates.
The bill does not identify English explicitly as the culprit, but Mr Jacques
Toubon, the culture minister, did so yesterday in an interview in Le Monde
newspaper. 'Anglo-Saxon countries, far from contenting themselves by
passively benefiting from the situation of English . . . are deploying
considerable efforts . . . to conquer new territory for their language,' the
minister complained.
He has already publicly bridled at the decision by Eurotunnel, the
Anglo-French company, to dub its Channel tunnel train 'Le Shuttle' rather
'La Navette', and in yesterday's interview went on to warn that 'use of a
foreign language is not always innocent . . . it can become an instrument of
domination'.
Despite the efforts of the Academie Francaise to dream up French equivalents
to expressions such as 'le corner' kick in football, such franglais may
prove hard to stamp out. French businessmen find 'le cash flow' easier to
use than 'la marge brute d'autofinancement'.
But perhaps fining such franglais users will help the French government with
its own cash-flow problem, otherwise known as its deficit.

FT  24 FEB 94 / Poll shows Europe split on trade access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European business leaders favour reducing barriers to imports from east Asia
and eastern Europe and cutting government intervention to boost the
continent's long-term economic prospects, according to an opinion poll for
the Financial Times published today.
The survey of senior directors from 507 top European companies in seven
countries underlines the sluggish recovery from recession as well as
disappointment with the 1993 single market. Some 77 per cent of respondents
said they had registered no benefits from last year's measures to lower
Europe's internal trade barriers.
The poll, carried out by Harris Research for the FT and five other European
newspapers, highlights large divergences of opinion among executives in the
main European Union countries. While 55 per cent of respondents favour
easier access for imports from regions such as east Asia and eastern Europe,
26 per cent in France and 27 per cent in Spain want higher trade barriers.
The main points are:
40 per cent of respondents expect the EU economy to contract this year,
while 51 per cent expect growth of 1 per cent or less.
Only 10 per cent expect to increase staff in 1994, with 45 per cent planning
job cuts. British executives are far less enthusiastic about deepening EU
integration than on the Continent.
51 per cent of respondents think a single European currency would improve
competitiveness. German and UK executives are most sceptical.
The 'tiger' economies of east Asia, such as Korea and Taiwan, are seen as
the greatest threats to European industry.
German, Dutch and Belgian executives are particularly worried about
competition from eastern Europe.
Companies hold divergent views on measures to stimulate the economy. Some 51
per cent of German executives want tax cuts, while 63 per cent of UK
respondents want minimal EU involvement in the economy.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain seeks to raise
FFr3.6bn

<TEXT>
Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday
announced a one-for-11 rights issue to raise FFr3.6bn (Dollars 616m). The
new shares will be priced at FFr550, a sharp discount from the FFr674 at
which trading opened yesterday.
The company said the capital increase would strengthen its balance sheet and
allow it to expand. However, a spokesman said that there was no specific
project behind the issue.
Over the past few years, the group has been seeking to reduce its debt
burden. Last year, group debts were reduced to FFr15bn from FFr18.1bn, and
the debt-to-equity ratio came down to 40 per cent at the end of 1993.
However, the company has also been seeking to expand in new markets, with an
emphasis on eastern Europe and south-east Asia.
Saint Gobain said that the company's principal shareholders had agreed to
subscribe to the offer, which will be managed by Banque Nationale de Paris,
Banque Indosuez and Lazard Freres. Shareholders will have priority rights to
subscribe to the issue between March 1 and March 21. The new shares will
have rights to the 1994 dividend.
The group's shares fell from FFr674 to FFr662 yesterday, following the news
of the rights issue. The shares have risen strongly over the past month,
since the company announced better-than-expected results, of FFr1.3bn, for
last year and after upbeat comments about this year's trading prospects by
Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman.
The rights issue is the latest in a series of capital increases by French
industrial groups, including Compagnie Generale des Eaux and Lafarge Coppee.
The SBF, the French stock market association, said the Paris market would be
able to absorb further issues, in spite of the impact of several substantial
privatisation issues.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: ICI sells 44.6% interest in Westralian
Sands for Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries has sold its 44.6 per cent stake in Westralian
Sands, an Australian producer of raw materials for the manufacture of
titanium dioxide, widely used in paint and paper production.
Proceeds of the sale amounted to Pounds 35m, and 'approaching Pounds 10m'
profit should be recorded in ICI's first quarter figures because the price
was higher than the book valuation.
Although the business was profitable, its disposal will have 'negligible'
impact on earnings, the company said.
The sale, by ICI's Tioxide subsidiary, appears to run counter to its
strategy of strengthening its position in the titanium dioxide market. Last
year it agreed a Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m) joint venture in North America
with Kronos, a subsidiary of NL Industries of Houston, Texas.
ICI said it sold the Westralian stake partly because it did not want to be
in mineral extraction and partly because the raw materials supplied by
Westralian were better suited to the obsolescent sulphate method of
titanium dioxide manufacture.
The rival chloride method is increasingly popular with manufacturers largely
because it is less polluting.
Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Tioxide's Japanese partner, has also sold its 18.5
per cent shareholding in Westralian.
Mr Ken Court, Westralian chairman, said that although Tioxide and Ishihara
would no longer have a stake in his company, both had large long-term
contracts to buy titanium minerals from Westralian.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Swedish PM defends EU budget demand: European Union
enlargement negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rejection of Sweden's controversial demand for reductions in its budgetary
contributions during its first five years in the European Union would
threaten the campaign for approval of union membership in a promised
referendum, according to Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister.
In a strong defence of Stockholm's attempt to phase in its budgetary
contributions, Mr Bildt said having to pay up from year one the full
SKr19bn-Skr20bn (Dollars 2.42bn) in gross contributions Sweden calculates it
will owe would cause 'a severe fiscal shock' at a time when the government
is having to cut back public spending to control a budget deficit running at
almost 15 per cent of gross domestic product.
'That would cause us real difficulties in the referendum campaign,' Mr Bildt
said in an interview.
Sweden's demand, lodged last week, that it be exempt from three-fifths of
its gross contributions for the first three years and not pay in full until
the sixth year has strengthened counter demands from existing members, led
by Spain, on how the new EU members' contributions are spent. Negotiations
on terms of accession for Sweden and its fellow-applicants Austria, Finland
and Norway are reaching a make-or-break stage with the EU's March 1 deadline
for completion now less than a week away. If the deadline is missed, the
target date of January 1 1995 for the four to enter the EU could lapse.
Mr Bildt stressed that Sweden's budget demand was temporary.' We fully
accept that Sweden will become one of the greatest - if not the greatest -
per capita contributor to the budget. We are asking only that our present
difficulties be taken into account for the first few years.'
He said he remained optimistic that the accession talks could be completed
by the March 1 deadline, but he attacked one Spanish demand, that the four
applicants be excluded from plans to establish a European monetary union.
'It is plainly absurd to say we should be without any say on Emu. They
cannot seriously think that this can be acceptable,' he said.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Frosty relations between 'Vikings' and 'Amigos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nordic nations now engaged in tortured negotiations to join the European
Union tend to believe that the Spanish have got it in for them, a view
shared by many of Spain's EU partners.
Spanish negotiators in the enlargement talks in Brussels this week with
Finland, Sweden, Norway (and Austria) have raised a thicket of obstacles for
the applicant countries to weave through, most recently over their future
entitlement to EU regional aid.
But Spain was instrumental yesterday in inventing a new kind of Euro-region,
to ensure that the almost empty, frozen north of Norway, Sweden and Finland
will get development aid from Brussels.
The neat-minded European Commission originally proposed including these
regions under 'Objective 1' of the existing 'Structural Funds'  - the
highest level of EU aid reserved for poor and backward regions such as
Andalucia in southern Spain. Spain (and others) objected that areas such as
Norrbotten in north Sweden, however remote, had a per capita income at 113
per cent of the EU average. This is about double Andalucia's average incomes
and over the Objective 1 threshold of 75 per cent.
Not to be dissuaded, the Commission came back with with a proposal for a new
'Objective 1A' classification, covering regions with a population density no
greater than seven people per square kilometre. '1A for Arctic' snorted the
Spaniards, who as relative newcomers to the Euro-club are less impressed by
the acronymic logorrhea and procedural wheezes of the more established
Eurocracy.
So '1A' was thrown out, for fear the rich newcomers would create confusion
with the really deserving recipients of EU money, that is Spain, Greece,
Portugal and Ireland.
But Spain did not want to be ungracious, and agreed on a special Nordic
regime for areas with eight or fewer inhabitants per square kilometre of
ice. Spain's European affairs minister, Mr Carlos Westendorp, one of the
hardest negotiators on the EU circuit, came prepared to do a deal. On the
flight from Madrid, he decided that the Nordic gods would smile on the
applicants, and that therefore the new regional scheme should be called Thor
(Territorial Help for Overfrozen regions), or Odin (Outstanding Donation for
Iced North).
Not to be outdone, his negotiating colleagues added Viking (Viable
Indicative Kit for Incorporating Nordic Goals) and Fiord (Financial
Instrument for Overfrozen Regions Demanding it). In case these suggestions
were 'returned to sender', they were countersigned 'Amigos'  - Arctic Most
Isolated Genuine Overfrozen System.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Dresdner Bank anger at tax raids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, is set to lodge a formal
complaint with the constitutional court over the conduct of tax authorities
in a series of recent raids at the bank's main branches in Frankfurt and
Dusseldorf.
The bank said yesterday it had been advised the raids were unconstitutional.
Up to 40 investigators have been involved in the tax probe, which focuses on
allegations that Dresdner bank employees have helped customers evade tax by
transferring money to Luxembourg. With court approval the tax authorities
have also confiscated mail sent from Luxembourg to Dresdner's Dusseldorf
branch.
The probe has sent shock-waves through the German banking community. Wealthy
Germans have transferred tens of billions of D-Marks to Luxembourg in recent
years to evade taxes but German financial institutions are prohibited from
actively promoting such business. The law was toughened last year to oblige
banks to check the identification and tax position of people making large
cash deposits.
The tax authorities alleged that Dresdner employees deliberately left off
details of customers, names and addresses from forms transferring money from
Germany to the Grand Duchy. Dresdner says this is in itself not illegal and
claims that the authorities have abused the constitution.

FT  23 FEB 94 / France admits defeat on reactor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France said yesterday it was abandoning its long and costly bid to run the
accident-prone Superphenix fast-breeder nuclear reactor as the world's first
commercial-scale breeder reactor and use it for research only.
The reactor would be used primarily for research into eliminating the
plutonium byproduct and other radioactive waste from ordinary French
reactors, the government said.
Superphenix was built at a cost of FFr29bn (Dollars 4.84bn) to produce up to
1,200MW of electricity, but it has run at full power for only 174 days since
it was commissioned in 1986.
Last month, the French nuclear safety directorate said Superphenix could be
restarted, but at less than full power and only if current work to improve
the safety of its sodium cooling system was finished. The reactor has been
shut down since a liquid sodium fire in July 1990.
Yesterday, the government said its decision not to restart the reactor at
full power was also because it wanted to limit the quantity of plutonium it
produced.
A breeder reactor can in theory, as its name implies, produce more fuel than
it consumes. This feature was considered an advantage when Superphenix was
conceived in the 1970s but has since been undermined by the fall in uranium
prices.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Rome government ends Fiat labour dispute to save jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has forged a costly deal between Fiat, the country's
biggest private employer, and the unions to avoid big job losses and
lay-offs in the motor industry. Fiat lost close to L1,800bn (Dollars 1.06bn)
last year.
The deal, affecting 16,600 of Fiat's 95,000 Italian workforce, contains
three main elements: an unprecedented use of early retirement for 6,600, and
special funding for 2,200 losing their jobs; the introduction of
work-sharing and a shorter working week influenced by events at Volkswagen;
a commitment by the government and Fiat to invest L450bn in developing
non-polluting cars.
An industry analyst described the agreement as 'the last of the old-style
corporatist deals with the state bankrolling labour peace and giving Fiat a
helping hand'.
A leading member of the main engineering union, Fiom, said: 'We fought hard
to make the point that this is throwing money at funding job losses instead
of finding money to finance an industrial strategy. This is a financial
solution; it does not secure the industrial future of Fiat or future jobs in
the motor industry.'
Fiat announced in November it wanted to cut the labour force by 5 per cent
and lay off 10 per cent more for two years. When it began implementing the
programme last month without union agreement there was a series of stoppages
at Fiat plants, especially those most at risk of closure.
The government wanted to bring the two sides together to avoid serious
labour unrest in the run-up to the March general elections.
Fiat has made an important concession in accepting the principle of
'solidarity contracts', a catch-all phrase covering work-sharing, a shorter
working week and lower salaries to ensure that people keep their jobs. Until
recently, it was insisting that this was not a productive use of labour and
proposed lay-offs for two years pending a sales recovery.
In return for acceptance the government has shouldered more of the social
and political cost of streamlining Fiat's automotive operations. Some 2,200
jobs have been saved.
However, the unions have not obtained the guarantees they would like about
Fiat's future. They fear plants could close, including Mirafiori, the
historic centre of Fiat's operations in Turin. They fear that production
will shift from the north to new plants like Melfi in the south and abroad.
The agreements on funding a clean car  - mostly for an electric car  - are
vague and it is not clear what proportion of the money will come from the
government. The success of the deal depends ultimately on whether the car
market begins to recover this year and whether Fiat returns as quickly to
profit as promised.

FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International conglomerate Hanson retreated 6 1/2 to 275p on turnover of 10m
shares as the group announced that it was raising Dollars 1bn through one of
the largest ever convertible bond offerings.
There was concern that the move could be a disguised rights issue carried
out in order to build up Hanson's war chest. And some analysts said the deal
might ultimately increase the amount of equity in issue by around 3.5 per
cent, thus diluting the value of existing shares. US reluctance to buy the
shares yesterday was, in fact, said to be in order to take advantage of the
issue, which one analyst described as 'extremely clever'.
Hanson is offering bonds which can be converted into shares at approximately
a 20 per cent premium to yesterday's price. Most analysts argued that the
conglomerate had managed to lock itself into a low rate fixed for seven
years at a time when US rates seem poised to rise. The announcement
coincided with Mr Alan Greenspan's warnings on US rates.
Big restructuring charges at Unilever saw the shares retreat sharply and
remain under pressure for most of the session. The stock ended 37 down at
1162p after 4.6m traded.
Rumours of provisions had overhung the shares recently, but yesterday's
Pounds 490m took the market by surprise. Analysts also remarked on the
weaker than expected volumes and the slightly cautious tone taken by the
company at the results meeting.
There were still some different interpretations of the outlook for the
stock. One food specialist said the generally bleak outlook for food
manufacturing meant Unilever's restructuring move could turn into an annual
event as the company attempted to keep up with events.
But Mr Carl Short at SGST believes Unilever's prospects for 1994 and beyond
are positive and the provisions augur well for subsequent trading. 'The
stock rating looks undemanding at these levels,' he said.
British Aerospace gained 9 at 540p ahead of today's full-year results. A
loss is expected but there are high hopes that the figures will show an
improvement in underlying performance.
Music and rental group Thorn EMI hit an all-time high of 1148p, up 10, on 2m
shares traded after reporting satisfactory results. However, analysts
considering upgrading profits forecasts came away discouraged after meeting
the company. Forecasts were left at around the Pounds 345m level for the
full year.
Rank Organisation added 4 at 1087p on the hope of good trading news at its
agm today.
Sedgwick, the UK's biggest insurance broker, pleased the market with its
preliminary results and the shares rose 5 to 188p, helping to stabilise
Willis Corroon, which settled only 2 easier at 208p.
Full-year results at the top end of analysts forecasts saw SmithKline
Beecham 'A' hold steady at 406p.
Textiles group Dawson International improved 9 to 155p on speculative
buying.
Conglomerate BTR firmed 2 1/2 to 370p after it said it was floating its
builders merchants subsidiary Graham Group at 183p a share. Lonrho eased 3
to 154p as nerves about next month's flotation of Ashanti Goldfield, in
which it holds a 45 per cent stake, set in.
Very heavy two-way business in Burton saw turnover hit 32m; the shares
slipped about a penny to 52 1/2 p.

settled marginally higher on the session at 339p, ahead of publication this
morning of the annual report from Ofgas, the industry regulator. In
addition, Gas's preliminary results are scheduled for tomorrow.
Kleinwort Benson is forecasting 'clean' historic cost net income of Pounds
1bn, the top of the market range, and an 8.6p final dividend, making 15p for
the year, a rise of 5.6 per cent and again at the top of the market range.
Nomura is more conservative on both its earnings and dividend estimates,
going for net income of Pounds 947m and a dividend total of 14.5p.

FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers led lower by GRE

<TEXT>
The composite insurers' preliminary reporting season got off to a disastrous
start, with a warning from Guardian Royal Exchange of increasing competition
in the UK market more than offsetting top of the range results from the
company.
Shares of all the big five UK composites were badly mauled, but none more so
than Guardian Royal's, which dropped 16, or 6.8 per cent, to 218p, in spite
of the good profits and satisfactory increase in the dividend total.
Turnover was a heavy 6.8m. Less than a month ago GRE shares reached a
four-year high of 247p.
The market took fright at worries that the UK premium rating environment may
have peaked and that the composites' earnings may be about to come under
pressure. Some analysts said, however, that the market had overreacted to
the GRE statement. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance specialist at Morgan Stanley,
said he expected the composites' earnings to continue to grow this year and
next year and pointed to the sector's 50 per cent yields premium over the
market. At BZW, Mr Andrew Pitt said he believed 'a softening of premium
rates can be accommodated by the continuing earnings recovery in the
sector'.
Commercial Union, due to report this morning, fell to 614p before closing 9
off at 624p, and Royal, with figures tomorrow, lost 8 at 298p. Sun Alliance
dipped 13 to 361p and General Accident 30 to 647p.

<TEXT>
A late afternoon rally in government bonds helped stock index futures close
off the day's low point after the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100
Index crashed through another support level, writes Joel Kibazo.
The reading on the March contract on the FT-SE 100 at the official close of
trading was 3,323, having earlier reached a low for the session of 3,302.
A setback in bond markets, together with an uncertain outlook on domestic
interest rates, reversed an initial advance in the contract. A trader said
that 'the contract was relentlessly sold down for most of the morning' and
it fell through the 3,340 support level. At one stage it recorded an
18-point discount to the underlying cash market, which followed it lower
over the lunchtime period.
The keenly awaited speech from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, which
helped to lift the bonds out of the doldrums, brought bargain hunters for
the contract, helping to reduce earlier losses. March was at a 7-point
discount to cash at the finish. Volume at the official close was 17,231
lots.
Activity in traded options improved and turnover rose to 47,384 contracts,
of which 23,473 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,703 in the Euro FT-SE
option. Guinness was the busiest stock option at 2,481 contracts dealt.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the OMLX, volume was 140 lots.

FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses halved in nervous
trading session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market ended one of the most difficult trading sessions of
recent weeks in relatively good form, helped by a rally in government bonds
following first reports from the testimony to the US Congress by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Traders admitted that nerves had
been taut throughout the day but regarded the final loss of 16.6 on the
FT-SE 100 Index, against a 30-point fall at midsession, as bearable, even
though the important 3,350 testing level was lost in early trading.
The closing Footsie reading of 3,333.7 left the index with little apparent
support above the 3,300 or even 3,250 mark. But in the stock index futures
sector, which has seen most of the recent sell-ing pressure, the March
contract on the Footsie index finished virtually in line with fair value, a
welcome improvement on recent performance.
Mr Greenspan's warning that real short-term interest rates in the US are
likely to rise was no worse than the market had expected and international
market analysts tended to focus on the more positive aspects of his speech.
The session had started uneasily for London, with government bonds reversing
early gains and the stock market hit by weakness in stock index futures. The
hardest blow, which sent the Footsie down by 30 points, came from the UK
government's panel of independent economic forecasters - the Wise Men  - who
warned of upward, as well as downward, pressures on domestic interest rates.
But the panel also suggested that economic growth would be solid enough to
withstand the tax rises due in April, a view supported by stronger GDP
statistics for the final quarter of last year. These two factors
strengthened stock market confidence in the outlook for UK company results.
The consensus view was that economic growth must be good for shares, even if
it diminishes the chances of a base rate cut in the near term. At Strauss
Turnbull, analysts drew attention to the strength of the consumer spending
content in the GDP figures.
The market soon recovered from the setback, which had also been wrought by
disappointment with trading statements from Unilever and Guardian Royal
Exchange.
The uncertainty across the range of equities took a further 15 points off
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which ended at 3,968.9. Trading volume was light at
first but picked up sharply towards the close as European bond markets
responded well to Mr Greenspan's comments. Seaq volume was finally 625.2m
shares, just below the total for the previous day. On Monday, London equity
trading was inhibited by the holiday closure on Wall Street, and customer,
or retail, activity in UK shares returned a value of only Pounds 983.6m, the
first non-holiday session to fall below the Pounds 1bn mark for many months.
Dealers stressed that selling pressure over the past fortnight has been
relatively modest
London markets were happy to see Mr Greenspan's speech to Congress safely
out of the way and confidence was encouraged by Wall Street's strong rise in
early trading yesterday. The Footsie has fallen nearly 6 per cent from its
peak, largely in response to worries over Federal Reserve policies. UK
stocks will this morning face the question of whether yesterday's warnings
on near term interest rate trends will put further pressure on valuations of
the equity market.

FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities advance as bonds
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks finished with solid gains yesterday after bonds responded
favourably to congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 24.20 higher at 3,911.66 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.77 ahead at 471.46. The American SE composite
gained 1.43 at 472.38, while the Nasdaq composite ended 2.30 up at 791.15
after recovering from early weakness. New York SE volume was 270m shares and
advances outscored declines by 1,139 to 996.
During Mr Alan Greenspan's remarks on monetary policy to the House banking
sub-committee, the market displayed none of the volatility which has
frequently surfaced since the Fed's decision to lift interest rates two
weeks ago. Stocks opened firmer, held their early gains and began to
accelerate near midday.
The key was a steady bond market. Speculation about the Fed's intentions
triggered a sharp sell-off in US Treasuries last week, but Mr Greenspan's
comments yesterday morning held no nasty surprises for the fixed-income
markets.
The Fed chairman, in his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, told
lawmakers that real short-term rates were likely to increase from present
levels, but he gave no hint on the timing of the central bank's next
tightening.
Mr Greenspan bolstered sentiment by restating his view that inflation was
under control and that he was committed to price stability. His comments
were enough to send longer-dated government bonds moderately higher on the
day.
Amid the fanfare surrounding Mr Greenspan's appearance on Capitol Hill, news
of a larger than expected decline in consumer confidence passed with little
notice. The Conference Board said its February index fell to 80.8, from a
revised 82.6 the previous month. A reading of 83 was expected by analysts.
By contrast, the announcement of a bullish first quarter by Deere captured
plenty of attention, with the stock jumping Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 82 1/2
. The farm equipment manufacturer posted earnings of Dollars 1.02 a share,
against an operating loss of 48 cents a year earlier.
Investors saw Deere's performance as a positive indication for other stocks
sensitive to economic trends. Among the Dow industrials, Caterpillar climbed
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 110 5/8 , 3M Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 107 3/4 and
Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 7/8 , but Alcoa shed Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 77.
In health care, newly merged Columbia HCA added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 42
3/4 after Merrill Lynch lifted its rating on the issue to 'long-term buy'.
Beverly Enterprises gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 14 5/8 on reports that it
was holding talks that could lead to a buy-out by Columbia.
Quaker Oats was Dollars 1 3/8 higher at Dollars 64 3/8 , thanks to an
upgrading by Ms Nomi Ghez, the Goldman Sachs analyst.
On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 7/8 . The
company announced that it was re-entering the notebook computer market.
Castle Energy dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 8 7/8 after
Metallgesellschaft said it might sell its 40 per cent stake in the oil
refining concern.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo surged 13.5 per cent in active trade, spurred by
strong buying in major blue chips such as telecom, mining, oil, power
utility and steel companies.
The Bovespa index of the 54 most active stocks ended 1,251 up at 10,537,
marking the highest daily rise since January 1992. Turnover totalled
Cr226.1bn (Dollars 380.2m).
Analysts said renewed optimism over the stabilisation programme put forward
by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister, boosted the market.
Traders were confident that congress would approve the government's social
welfare fund proposal during a second vote scheduled for today in Brasilia.
Analysts said fears over the implementation of a new single price index were
also prompting players to pump fresh money into the stock market. Mr Cardoso
has said that he will adopt the new index on March 1.
Telebras, the telecommunications group, soared 16.3 per cent to Cr29.30,
while Vale do Rio Doce, the mining company, was up 18 per cent to Cr72.
Petrobras, the oil group, was 15 per cent higher at Cr115.
Canada
Toronto ended mixed after moderate trading as market participants awaited
the release of the federal budget later that day. The TSE 300 index gained
22.1 at 4,371.1 but declining issues led advances by 399 to 368 after volume
of 69.8m shares.

FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Political worries remove the sparkle
from Manila - But support for equities remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippine stock market has eased substantially from the all-time peaks
it hit early in January, following on from its sparkling performance in
1993.
While optimism over economic recovery has given it some support in recent
weeks, the close in the composite index yesterday, down 2.17 at 3,003.43,
leaves it with a decline of 9 per cent since the start of the year.
In 1993 the index soared by more than 150 per cent; and, according to many
analysts, worries over the political environment could still derail the
nascent recovery.
Yet the performance of equities accelerated in the last quarter of 1993,
influenced by the influx of foreign funds into Asian markets in general. By
the end of 1993, market capitalisation had soared to 956bn pesos (Dollars
34bn), an increase of 182 per cent from the previous year.
Tremors on the political front, caused by bickerings over the leadership of
the ruling coalition, and proposed changes in the constitution, were
followed later by popular protest over a package of price increases: in
petroleum products, power rates and transport fares.
Mr Fidel Ramos, the president, had to reverse the increases to stave off
labour strikes and street demonstrations. Meetings are now being held with
various sectors to come up with new government revenue schemes that will not
entail price adjustments.
All of this has not been lost on investors. After turnover averaged some 3bn
pesos a day in early January, it has fallen to 1.3bn pesos a day at the
country's two main exchanges, Manila and Makati.
Most domestic analysts are unperturbed, calculating that because of expected
faster economic growth - forecasts put it at 4.5 per cent this year, after
2.3 per cent in 1993 - equities should turn in similar gains this year.
Forecasts suggest that the composite index could rise to between 4,000 to
4,500 in the first half; there are corporate earnings growth expectations of
between 40 and 50 per cent in 1994.
After hectic sessions in late-December and early-January, trading in recent
weeks has become conspicuously selective, with interest concentrated on
market leaders.
Current favourites include PLDT, the telecommunications group, which closed
yesterday off 5 pesos at 2,135 pesos, San Miguel, the beer and food group,
down 5 pesos at 219 pesos, Meralco, the power utility, 2.50 pesos easier at
455 pesos, Ayala, the property-based conglomerate, down 1.50 pesos at 33.50
pesos, and its subsidiary Ayala Land, up 0.50 pesos at 33.50 pesos,
Philippine National Bank, off 5 pesos at 655 pesos, and Benpres, the
telecommunications company.
Most brokers are advising investors to take a long term view and to avoid
speculative issues.
Some analysts comment that food shares may have the best earnings potential,
because of the high level of disposable income that is spent by households
on food.
Others point to property and construction services stocks, which should
benefit from the economic recovery.
Overall economic growth this year is expected to be bolstered by increased
infrastructure spending by the government and accelerated inflows of foreign
investments. Domestic interest rates remain high - between 15 to 20 per cent
 -compared to levels in global capital markets, but they have fallen
substantially from historic highs seen in 1991.

Tokyo
Share prices fluctuated on arbitrage trading, the Nikkei 225 average finally
closing moderately lower on small-lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index lost 51.31 at 19,342.63 after setting a day's low of 19,327.13,
and a high of 19,561.56. The Topix index of all first section stocks
finished 2.21 up at 1,572.17.
The Nikkei 225 rallied at the end of the morning on reports that Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, a representative of the Japan Renewal party, had said that he was in
favour of numerical targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets.
Prospects of a compromise between the US and Japan over trade encouraged
stock and currency market dealers, pushing up the Nikkei briefly and
supporting the dollar against the yen.
Volume came to 310m shares, against 234m. Rises led falls by 614 to 388,
with 174 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 was 0.08 firmer at 290.59, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 0.37 to 1,304.42.
Steel issues were lower on profit-taking. Nippon Steel receded Y3 to Y337
and Kobe Steel Y7 to Y260. Selling also hit some banks, with Industrial Bank
of Japan down Y10 to Y3,190 and Sumitomo Bank slipping Y20 to Y2,120.
Brokers, however, were higher on institutional buying. Nomura Securities
gained Y10 at Y2,240.
Telecommunications and high-technology stocks were firm on the multimedia
theme. Toshiba, the day's most active issue, rose Y9 to Y726 and Hitachi Y8
to Y900. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y20,000 to Y934,000.
But profit-taking depressed Matsushita Electric Industrial by Y30 to Y1,690,
while TDK relinquished Y50 at Y6,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 123.45 to 21,387.85 in volume of 109.6m
shares. Roundup
Rebounds were seen in some Pacific Rim markets after Monday's weakness.
HONG KONG was sharply higher on active bargain hunting and futures-linked
buying. The Hang Seng index closed near the day's high, up 217.56, or 2.1
per cent, at 10,674.01, having picked up from a 151-point deficit after some
early profit-taking. Preliminary volume was low at HKDollars 5.1bn but above
Monday's HKDollars 4.26bn.
February and March index futures surged forward 390 and 395 points
respectively to 10,850 and 10,860, leaving premiums of about 180 points to
the cash market.
Blue chips in the property sector, which suffered most losses in the recent
bear run, became targets of the late buying. Sun Hung Kai Properties jumped
HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 61 and Henderson Land HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars
47.50.
SINGAPORE advanced 2.1 per cent on strong institutional and retail buying
which took the market back to levels last seen in late December. The Straits
Times Industrial index added 49.49 at 2,400.36, underpinned by expectations
of good corporate results, and a positive government budget announcement
today.
AUSTRALIA recouped half of Monday's loss, helped by futures trading, but
investors remained hesitant ahead of last night's speech by Mr Alan
Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve Board chairman. The All Ordinaries index
ended 24 ahead at 2,202.5.
NEW ZEALAND finished weaker after a roller-coaster day's trading that saw
the NZSE-40 capital index lose 30 points, recover to 4 points above the
opening mark, and collapse again at the close.
The early drop was attributed to worries about weakness in the US and
European markets, before investors were heartened by news that Moody's, the
US ratings agency, was considering a possible upgrade of New Zealand's
sovereign debt. But the higher trend could not be maintained and the index
fell back to finish 23.76 down at 2,217.64.
TAIWAN closed lower for the fourth straight session and turnover continued
to shrink, although some late buying in selected financials was viewed as a
positive sign.
The weighted index quickly gave up an early gain to finish a net 49.98 off
at 5,733.91, in turnover that fell to TDollars 41.53bn, its lowest this
year, compared with Monday's TDollars 42.2bn.
SEOUL closed higher amid demand for blue chips, although some selling
pressure knocked prices off an early peak. The composite index gained 7.22
at 953.22, having touched 959.11 in the morning. Volume was a moderate 33m
shares.
JAKARTA rebounded on local support in slow trading, and the JKSE index
improved 9.09 to 552.85.
BOMBAY ended softer on mild profit-taking and lack of buying support at
levels which market players considered high after Monday's 5.5 per cent
advance. The BSE 30-share index retreated 44.63 to 4,084.89.
KARACHI felt the benefit of a fresh inflow of foreign funds to the chemical
and energy sectors which took the KSE index 32.17 higher to 2,407.58.

FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover from early
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses threw off their earlier weakness late yesterday afternoon although,
in Washington, the much-awaited testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, seemed to indicate that further increases in US interest
rates were simply a matter of time, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT responded to a rising US equity market and the Dax index, which
had slipped just below 2,100 during the session - which it closed 11.91
lower at 2,107.62 - recovered to 2,113.64 in Ibis trade by the end of the
day.
Turnover rose from DM6.4bn to DM7.6bn. The afternoon produced some big
winners in the financial sector, after a brief dip in bunds immediately
after the Greenspan news. Allianz hit DM2622.5 in London after falling DM29
to DM2,600 on the session and Bayernhypo DM464 after DM454, down DM7.30.
In industrials, BMW recovered from a Honda scare to end DM15 to the good on
the afternoon at DM854 after falling DM9 to DM839 on the session.
Mannesmann's 1993 loss left it DM4 lower DM421 after a relatively stable
morning, and brokers said foreign buying took Contnental, the tyremaker, up
DM6.50 on the session to DM272.50.
PARIS gathered pace after viewing Mr Greenspan's comments as mildly positive
for equities. On the first day of the new account the CAC-40 index improved
11.53 to 2,226.73 in turnover of FFr4.8bn.
St-Gobain was one of the sharpest fallers, down FFr12 at FFr662 after the
industrial materials group announced a FFr3.6bn rights issue.
Euro Disney dipped FFr2.05 to FFr34.75 as investors remained worried about
restructuring plans.
AMSTERDAM was disappointed with Unilever's results, marking the shares down
Fl 6.30 or 2.7 per cent to Fl 221.50 by the close. The downturn in the food
and comsumer products stock had a marked effect on the AEX index, which
ended the session off 3.30 at 422.23.
While Unilever's results came in at the bottom end of forecasts, most
analysts' remain broadly positive about the group's prospects, with
expectations that it will benefit from the recovery in worldwide consumer
markets.
Nedlloyd, the transport and distribution group, was another loser, off Fl
2.50 at Fl 73.30, with some investors continuing to switch into the
convertible bond.
ZURICH edged lower as waited for Mr Greenspan, with program trading related
to futures and options adding to the unpredictable mood. The SMI index shed
14.8 to 2,982.8.
SMH registered added SFr6.50 to SFr207.50 on the Daimler go ahead for
Mercedes to co-operate in the development of the environmentally friendly
Swatch-Mobile small car project.
MILAN fell prey to profit-taking after its recent strong run, prompting
expectations that the market could face a volatile period in the run-up to
elections next month. The Comit index fell 12.39 or 1.8 per cent to 672.16.
Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan noted that much of the day's
selling was by domestic investors, while foreigners, already fully weighted
in Italian stocks, had become increasingly reluctant to buy at current high
prices.
The banking sector remained at the centre of attention. BCI fell 4.9 per
cent on profit-taking ahead of its privatisation which begins next week. The
ordinary stock, which has surged more than 25 percent since the start of the
year, shed L305 to L6,234.
Fiat fell L89 to L4,890 as a series of strikes and protests against Monday
night's agreement on jobs cuts clouded the chances that a final agreement
would be signed before the weekend deadline.
ISTANBUL's composite index lost another 932.62 or 5.4 per cent to 16,317.5.
WARSAW saw Bank Slaski shares rise 10 per cent to 4.6m zlotys after the
stock exchange's supervisory body again refused on Monday evening to suspend
the stock, in spite of pressure from the finance ministry, writes
Christopher Bobinski.
Bank Slaski management has now confirmed that the bank's broking office is
registering stocks without delay which means that those shareholders who
have accounts with brokers are now able to sell and buy the stock freely.
Demand for Bank Slaski shares remains high with turnover at 171bn zlotys
(Dollars 7.7m) yesterday seeing a mere 25 per cent of buy offers finding
sellers.
Although the share price has oscillated at around eight times its public
offer price of 500,000 zlotys, the price/earnings ratio of 22.9 means it is
the cheapest on the exchange, where the average p/e is 34.5.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar finishes lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday weakened after comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the US Federal Reserve, dampened speculation of another near-term rise in
US interest rates, writes Philip Gawith.
Against a background of nervous financial markets, Mr Greenspan appeared to
pursue a policy of calming nerves by giving away as little as possible.
Indeed, some observers were underwhelmed by his efforts, saying he had
succeeded only in turning what had formerly been a highlight in the
financial calendar into a bore.
The US currency ended softer against the D-Mark at DM1.7269, down from
Monday's DM1.7275. It was also easier against the yen as US-Japan trade
tensions remained to the fore ahead of Saturday's meeting of G7 finance
ministers in Frankfurt, where this issue is expected to top the agenda. In
New York the dollar finished at DM1.7235 and Y105.54.
In Europe the D-Mark enjoyed support from an unchanged repo rate at 6 per
cent, but worries about industrial unrest continue to weigh on the currency.
It finished unchanged at FFr3.398, was stronger against the Italian lira but
lower against the Belgian franc.
The weaker dollar reflected Mr Greenspan's failure to deliver the message of
further monetary tightening that many in the market had anticipated. Little
that he said was new, and no light was shed on the crucial question of the
timing of the next policy move. The movements in the currency, however, were
mild.
The market's view of Mr Greenspan's comments was bolstered by a lower than
expected US consumer confidence number for February - 80.8 compared to a
market expectation of 82.7 - which appears to support the view that a
further tightening of policy might be premature.
Reports from Asian markets said the Bank of Japan was continuing to
intervene to support the dollar against the yen.
Sterling performed reasonably well yesterday, buoyed by a slight upward
revision of fourth-quarter GDP growth to 0.8 per cent from a provisional
estimate of 0.7 per cent. It closed mildly higher in London against the
dollar at Dollars 1.4785, from Dollars 1.4755 on Monday. It also improved
against the D-Mark, ending at DM2.5531 from DM2.5488, although analysts said
this was mostly a reflection of D-Mark weakness.
Indeed, Mr Mark Geddes, UK Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets,
said the 'tone' in the market towards sterling was 'very negative'. He added
that there had been a 'subtle change' in sentiment towards the pound since
the rate cut of two weeks ago. 'Market attention has now shifted to when,
and not if, interest rates will next be cut.'
Against this background Mr Geddes said he was surprised at the optimistic
tone of the report produced yesterday by the panel of six wise men who
advise the government on economic policy. The panel said it did not believe
tax increases that take effect in April would threaten the recovery. It did
say, however, that it expected interest rates to rise next year.
This view was taken to heart in the sterling futures market, with prices at
the long end falling sharply. Yesterday afternoon the September 95 future
had dropped by 21 points to trade at 93.92. The December 94 future was
trading at 94.70, showing the market view that the base rate is likely to be
5.3 per cent at the end of the year - higher than the existing rate of 5.25
per cent.
Some analysts said the impact of the report had probably been exaggerated by
the fact that it came at a time when there is a general nervousness about
interest rates.
Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister of Canada's newly formed Liberal
government, yesterday delivered his budget against the background of a
market jittery about the state of fiscal and monetary policy.
The Canadian dollar has recently been under considerable pressure, a problem
exacerbated by the virtual disappearance of the historical interest rate
differential with the US dollar.
The gap on three-month Treasury bills has fallen to 33 basis points, the
narrowest level in more than a decade, compared to a peak of 600 points
early in 1990. The spread on 30-year bonds is currently 80 basis points.
Mr Martin aggravated matters earlier this month when he said Canadian rates
might fall below US rates. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said Mr
Martin would probably have done better to pursue this aim by stealth.
Mr Geddes said the Canadian dollar might show short-term strength if the
budget deficit announced were below CDollars 40bn. The government has been
vocal in saying how difficult this would be to achieve, and posting a figure
below this level would be a psychological fillip for the government and
currency.
The Bank of England yesterday provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.65bn
of assistance, in line with its revised forecast liquidity shortage. The
bulk of assistance was given through a Pounds 1.25bn repo arrangement at the
prevailing interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan oil deal back on
track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the biggest-ever oil deals, on which negotiations have been stalled
for nearly a year, is back on the drawing board and a decision is expected
in the next few months.
Mr Heydar Aliev, president of Azerbaijan, has decreed that negotiations
restart and a contract be signed with a seven-member western consortium for
the exploitation of multi-billion dollar reserves in the Caspian Sea.
Mr Aliev is in London this week for talks with Mr John Major, the British
Prime Minister, as well as with British Petroleum and other oil companies.
The Azeri president earlier this month dramatically raised the status of the
negotiations when he put the Azeri State Oil Company back in charge of the
talks with the consortium and told it to conclude a deal as soon as
possible. The heads of the companies' delegations have been summoned to
talks in Baku, the Azeri capital, on Friday.
Mr Aliev has also decreed explicitly that the western advisers, including
leading law firms and accountancy companies, should again be retained to
advise the Azeri government on the terms of the deal. The consortium sees
this as the most promising move for some months, underlining the seriousness
of the Azeri side and making more likely an agreement to which both sides
could assent.
After coming to power last year Mr Aliev slowed down negotiations and
removed the Azeri company from direct responsibility, Now, however, a series
of events are forcing his hand.
The war with Armenia over the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh within
Azerbaijan has gone badly for the Azeris, with 20 per cent of their
territory now in Armenian hands and over 1m refugees living in camps around
Baku. Mr Aliev, speaking in the capital over the weekend, said that it was
now taking 'an ever increasing part of our spending' to feed the people and
keep the war going.
A major platform in the Gneshli field, the main production field now in
operation, collapsed recently and cannot be replaced because the cost is
prohibitive.
The amount of oil brought ashore by the Azeri State Oil Company is set to
decline rapidly, because lack of maintenance has allowed a gas cap to build
up.
Added to this, separate negotiations between the Azeri government and
Lukoil, the Russian state oil company, appear to have concluded - though Mr
Aliev would not confirm this - that Lukoil will take a 10 per cent stake in
the consortium - that 10 per cent coming out of the 25 per cent stake
originally reserved for the Azeri company.
Though there were fears that the entry of the Russians would complicate the
issue, the western partners - which include, besides BP, Statoil, Penzoil,
Amoco and Ramco - now believe that it will make the deal more stable.
Russia, whose influence in Azerbaijan has grown, was in a position to
exercise considerable pressure and could have blocked one possible pipeline
route out of Azerbaijan.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact comes into operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new five-year cocoa agreement went into force yesterday, even though
membership by consumer countries was short of requirements.
Brazil's completion of membership formalities means that producer countries
in the pact represent nearly 87 per cent of world exports, well above the
required 80 per cent.
But consumer membership represents only 54 per cent of world imports, short
of the necessary 60 per cent. Pact members are expected today to give
countries a new deadline of the end of the cocoa year in September to join
up. Portugal is expected to do so shortly, with Ireland, Italy and Slovakia
following. But Russia, representing just over 2 per cent of imports, gave no
indication yesterday about joining.
The agreement will aim to balance supply and demand.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commissioner rejects Gatt
attack on EU banana regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rene Steichen, European agriculture commissioner, has rejected a report
by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade attacking the European Union's
preferential trade with banana producers in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific.
He said the report was unacceptable because of the political and economic
consequences for the former colonies if the EU was forced to open its market
to cheaper Latin American bananas.
The Gatt report, published earlier this month, upheld a complaint by five
Latin American banana exporters that trade with ACP states under the Lome
convention contravened Gatt rules.
'Banana exports to the EU are the mainstay of certain ACP economies and the
community is not prepared to walk away from these countries,' said a
commission official.
The commission has withdrawn an offer to increase access to Latin American
bananas from 2m tonnes to 2.2m tonnes over two years because those countries
did not accept the condition that they drop their complaint to Gatt.
Brussels is due to submit proposals on market access, including bananas, to
Gatt in the next few days. 'If those five countries came back before that
and said we can accept (the increased offer), I can imagine one could find a
means of putting it back on the table,' said the official.
However, the Latin Americans want an increase in the quota to 2.5m tonnes,
and reductions in tariffs for bananas both within and above the quota. They
also want a reform the import licence system for bananas entering the EU,
which they say discriminates against new producers.
Mr Steichen said there might be a need for a one-off increase in imports,
which would benefit Latin American growers, because of a recent shortage of
supplies. But this would not affect the quota.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash crisis threatens Nigerian
earnings - Debts to private sector partners stand at Dollars 750m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's failure to fund the state's 60 per cent share of the country's
2m-barrels-a-day oil production is jeopardising its only major source of
export earnings.
As arrears due from the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
to its private sector partners reach about Dollars 750m, the multinationals
who produce Nigeria's oil have suspended payments to contractors at oil
fields and postponed investment in big projects until the government clears
the five-month backlog.
When the oil companies meet head of state General Sani Abacha later this
month they will present him with a stark choice: scale down production
capacity or divest some of the state's assets in the oil fields. Unless the
government resolves the cash crisis, within two years oil production
capacity will fall by 25 per cent.
'The trouble is that the people who run the country are not thinking about
two years down the line, they seem to be more concerned with the next few
weeks,' says an oil industry expert in Nigeria.
Although the head of state's budget speech last month set aside Dollars
3.1bn for oil exploration and production, the oil majors say that NNPC has a
dedicated account for cash calls to the value of 200,000 b/d, which at the
budget's assumed price of Dollars 14 a barrel, is not nearly enough.
The problem lies not with the budget but with implementation and it casts
doubt on the government's claim to have made its accounts more transparent.
The oil industry needs about Dollars 3.6bn this year to operate and maintain
capacity. NNPC's share of that is just over Dollars 2bn.
NNPC's arrears were at a tolerable level until mid-1993. But 'last year's
dedicated account for NNPC's payments was not enough when oil prices fell',
according to a senior oil executive. 'Arrears built up, reaching Dollars
455m by end of November. From the start of this year all payments have to be
approved by the presidency.'
Since General Abacha took over the government in November, payment of cash
calls has almost dried up. In January, two cheques in naira from NNPC to
Shell for local costs were bounced by the central bank, leading to a
desperate scramble to pay salaries at the end of the month.
In the face of a severe balance of payments deficit Nigeria needs every
petrodollar it can get. The oil fields are producing at maximum capacity of
about 2m b/d a day, just over its Opec quota for crude oil, and the
government plans to raise capacity to 2.5m b/d to increase its quota and
allow it to benefit from any future rally in the oil price.
A sale of about 9 per cent of the equity in existing joint ventures could be
politically damaging, but unless the cash crisis in the industry is
resolved, the government's projections will become meaningless and the
economy will be threatened with collapse. Last July the government breached
its 40 per cent ceiling on foreign holdings in the oil joint ventures when
it sold sold 5 per cent of the biggest venture, Shell's 955,000 b/d
operation, to Elf Nigeria for about Dollars 500m, taking the combined
Shell-Elf-Agip share to 45 per cent. Divestment of another 4 per cent of the
Shell fields and 9 per cent of the joint ventures operated by Mobil, Chevron
and others would leave NNPC with a majority stake but reduce government's
cash calls to a more manageable level.
The rapid investment by the oil multinationals in the gas industry will soon
be competing for more scarce state funds. The final investment decision on
the Liquefied Natural Gas plant is due next March and will require the
government to put in another Dollars 1.2bn. Moreover, it has yet to secure
its share of Chevron's Dollars 500m gas gathering project at the Escravos
field. Meanwhile, private sector finance is providing the impetus for the
exploration of new deep water blocks, following the award of exploration and
production contracts to multinational oil companies last year.

European farm ministers have dismissed plans for an extra 3 per cent cut in
the butter price for 1994-95 and further curbs on beef aid, saying they
would inflict more hardship on farmers, Reuter reports from Brussels.
France, together with Spain and other southern member states, also
criticised the Commission's delay in proposing wine, sugar, fruit and

Mr Rene Steichen, the farm commissioner, said he was 'dumbstruck' by
ministers' demands for more aid when the budget was already stretched beyond
the limit.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Welsh cereal growers appeal to
Brussels over compensation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh cereal growers are calling on Brussels to intervene in their battle
with the UK government over compensation payments for cuts in cereal support
prices.
The Welsh want to receive the same payments as English cereal growers.
Pressure from Wales's 4,000 cereal farmers forced the government last week
to drop controversial proposals to divide Wales into two regions based on
1,000 parishes, with one region getting higher payments than the other.
The scheme was denounced as unfair and divisive by the National Farmers'
Union of England and Wales. In some cases, neighbours and even single farms
were split into separate payment regions.
However, the Welsh farmers are just as angry about the government's new
proposals to divide Wales this year into two payment regions based on
existing Less Favoured Areas and non-Less Favoured Areas. Farmers in the
former receive special payments for livestock because of the poor terrain
and will receive lower cereals payments than counterparts.
Mr Bill Goldsworthy, Welsh NFU director, has written to Mr Frank Leguen de
Lacroix, assistant to the agriculture director-general, to ask for his views
on the new proposals.
When Mr Lacroix visited Wales in January, he said he was puzzled by the
earlier, parish-based proposals.
'You will appreciate I am sure, following your visit, that this decision is
equally unpalatable to a different section of Welsh cereal growers,' Mr
Goldsworthy told Mr Lacroix.
He said some Welsh cereal growers producing top yields of eight or nine
tonnes a hectare would get compensation based on output of only 3.32 tonnes
a hectare, while other Welsh growers would be granted 5.17 tonnes a hectare
and English cereal farmers would get 5.93 tonnes a hectare.
Mr John Redwood, secretary of state for Wales, said last week that most
specialist cereal growers were in the non-LFAs and would benefit from higher
payments in line with the views of the industry.
Making England and Wales a single payment region 'would not be in the best
interests of the UK as a whole,' said an official, declining to elaborate.
English cereal farmers, who would suffer a small drop in payments, appear to
have accepted the idea of a single region, with Mr David Naish, NFU
president, strongly advocating it.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Long-dated Treasuries advance after
testimony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds advanced yesterday after congressional
testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman produced no unpleasant surprises.
The price of short-dated paper was down slightly. Late in the session, the
benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 higher at 95 15/32 ,with the
yield slipping to 6.596 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note eased
 1/32 to 99, to yield 4.527 per cent.
The market's reaction to remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was
restrained, in sharp contrast to the volatility of recent sessions.
In his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy, he told
lawmakers that real short-term interest rates were likely to increase, but
he gave no indication of the timing of the central bank's next move to lift
its target for the Fed Funds rate, now at 3.25 per cent.
Mr Greenspan stressed, however, that a failure to tighten 'in a timely
manner' would lead to an unnecessary rise in long-term rates on the
financial markets.
Despite his vigilant tone on inflation, long-term bond prices fell during
the first hour of testimony. When a significant sell-off failed to
materialise, however, the market quickly reversed course.
After several false starts, the long bond pushed well into positive
territory during the afternoon. The short end, however, remained weak.
Amid the attention focused on the Fed chairman's comments, a
bigger-than-expected decline in consumer confidence this month went largely
unnoticed.
The Conference Board, an industry association, said its index fell to 80.8
for February, from a revised 82.6 in January, and compared with a consensus
forecast of 83.
In Europe, bond markets stabilised after their recent sharp falls, but
trading conditions remained volatile. While some traders reported cautious
buying by professional investors, most said activity remained thin.
According to Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International, the
European bond markets are beginning to build a base from which they can
rally. 'Now that Treasuries have begun to stabilise, the European markets
can focus again on their own fundamentals, allowing them to push ahead,' he
said.
Most observers expect a sustainable European bond market recovery to be
triggered by the next cut in the Bundesbank's rate for securities repurchase
agreements. The rate has again been fixed at 6 per cent for today's repo
allocation, but is expected to fall once the wage talks in the German
engineering sector have been resolved.
Like most European markets, UK gilts had a rollercoaster session. The short
end came under pressure following a report from the UK Treasury panel of
advisers, known as the six wise men, which showed divisions over the need
for further cuts in interest rates.
The long end of the yield curve strengthened slightly, supported by
continental European markets. Nevertheless, gilts underperformed bunds, with
the 10-year spread over Germany widening to 90 basis points from 85 basis
points on Monday.
The market's firmer tone boosted hopes that today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn
of 7 per cent gilts due 2001 would go smoothly.
German government bonds ended a volatile session slightly higher. In
after-hours trading the bund future rose further to close near the day's
high of 97.95, up from 97.36 on Monday.
Traders now are awaiting January M3 money supply numbers, expected this
week. Although most traders expect them to lie above the Bundesbank's target
range, 'a bad number could cause a kneejerk sell-off,' said one dealer.
French bonds ended little changed, in line with most other markets. The
notional long bond futures contract on Matif closed at 127.54, up 0.02
point.
Japanese government bonds firmed in Tokyo and continued to strengthen in
London as speculation of a cut in the 1.75 per cent official discount rate
intensified. Easing talk was fuelled by the release of a worse-than-expected
diffusion index and the announcement that the Bank of Japan will publish its
quarterly Tankan economic report on March 1, earlier than expected.
The June JGB futures contract rose 0.14 point to 112.39 in Tokyo but rose
further to 112.80 in late London trading.

<TEXT>
Bangkok Bank's Dollars 400m convertible Eurobond has received a lukewarm
response, forcing the bank to reduce the price at which holders can convert
the bonds into shares, according to bankers and brokers in Bangkok.
The offer is the largest Thai Euroconvertible issue to date. Thai companies
raised Dollars 1.4bn by this method last year.
Typical Thai conversion price premiums above the share price at the time of
launch have been 20 per cent; Bangkok Bank had hoped for a premium of
between 23 and 26 per cent, but was obliged to settle at 15 per cent.
The interest rate for the issue, lead managed by Morgan Stanley, was set at
3.25 per cent. The issue was fully subscribed, with options for a further
Dollars 60m, although Bangkok Bank had considered raising up to Dollars
500m.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Ghana sells stakes in seven
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Ghana sold stakes in seven Ghanaian companies to
international investors yesterday in a deal worth Dollars 25m - equivalent
to nearly one-quarter of the total market capitalisation of the Ghana stock
market.
The government has stressed its determination to forge ahead with its
privatisation programme, encourage foreign direct and portfolio investment
in Ghana, and improve trading and liquidity on the stock market.
Next month, it is due to sell up to 25 per cent of Ashanti Goldfields
Corporation, the country's biggest gold producer, jointly owned by UK-based
Lonrho group and the government.
The sale would reduce the government stake from 55 per cent to 30 per cent,
in a deal which analysts believe could raise Pounds 250m (Dollars 369m).
However, a group of Ghanaians oppose the sale, and are taking legal action
in an attempt to block the offering. Their high court hearing was adjourned
yesterday. Some investment bankers believe the action is unlikely to pose
much of a threat to the offering.
The government yesterday sold its entire holdings in seven companies listed
on the Ghana stock exchange - Accra Brewery, Equity Insurance, Guinness
Ghana, Kumasi Brewery, Pioneer Tobacco, Standard &amp; Chartered Ghana, and
Unilever Ghana.
The shares were placed with international fund management groups by Databank
Brokerage, a Ghanaian investment bank, and Blakeney Management, a
London-based adviser to emerging market funds.
Mr Miles Morland, of Blakeney Management, said the Ghanaian government had
sold stakes varying in size from 18 per cent to 40 per cent. Most of these
companies have key foreign shareholders (for example, Unilever in the case
of Unilever Ghana), while the remaining shares are in public hands.
Yesterday's transaction, combined with the forthcoming Ashanti Goldfields
deal, should 'act as a catalyst to get the privatisation process going,'
said Mr Morland.
There are 15 companies listed on the Ghana stock exchange. The volume of
trading is expected to increase dramatically once Ashanti Goldfields is
floated.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Bonds: East Japan Railway launches Dollars
600m Eurobond offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several issuers took advantage of yesterday's bounce in leading government
bond markets to get their planned international bond offerings off the
ground.
The main deal of the day was East Japan Railway's widely-expected Dollars
600m offering of 10-year Eurobonds. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 55
basis points over comparable US Treasuries, was judged to be fair to
generous by the market so syndicate managers involved in the deal were
surprised at the disappointing level of interest from the Far East and some
areas of Europe.
However, they reported brisk demand for the bonds from UK and German
institutions and from US offshore accounts in the afternoon.
Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that by the close of business in London it
was left with around Dollars 25m worth of its allocation of just over half
of the whole offering. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was
largely unchanged from its launch level.
Meanwhile, the market was limbering up for the imminent launch of the
much-heralded 10-year global bond offering from the Asian Development Bank
(ADB). Price talk on the proposed Dollars 750m transaction, which is being
jointly led by IBJ International and Salomon Brothers, ranged between 16 and
20 basis points over US Treasuries. Syndicate managers expected the ADB deal
to be launched at the start of Tokyo trading today.
The African Development Bank has awarded the mandate for its forthcoming
Dollars 500m offering of 10-year Eurobonds to Lehman Brothers and Salomon
Brothers. The bonds are expected to be priced to yield around four basis
points above the yield on the ADB offer.
Elsewhere, Tokyo Electron raised FFr1.1bn through a four-year bond issue
with warrants attached. Lead manager Nomura France said the offering was the
first of its type by a Japanese company since 1991 and reflected renewed
interest in the Euro-French franc market by Japanese issuers.
The Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday signed a Pounds 1.5bn Euro-medium-term
note programme. The multi-currency programme has been arranged by Merrill
Lynch.
Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has placed New Zealand's
double-A3 foreign currency rating on review for a possible upgrade. Around
Dollars 7.8bn of long-term debt is affected.
Moody's said its move reflected signs that the restructuring of the New
Zealand economy, which has been under way for a number of years, was having
the expected salutary effects.
Moody's review will focus on the sustainability of present economic trends
in a changing political environment, since the new electoral system may mean
that coalition-building becomes the norm, contrary to New Zealand tradition.

Home Shopping Network and Tele-Communications of the US yesterday announced
they had set up a joint venture with Sumitomo of Japan to introduce a
television shopping channel in Japan. Transmissions are expected to begin
within a year.
The three companies have signed a letter of intent as a first step towards
establishing a television shopping business in Japan similar to those
already operating in the US. They said they hoped to involve other big
companies in the venture.
Home Shopping Network at present operates three cable and broadcast services
capable of reaching 60m viewers in the US. It said recently-announced
changes in Japanese government policy on television regulation had opened
the way to greater openness in cable and direct-to-home distribution.
The companies said the channel would be tested soon after a feasibility
study.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: UK banks seek new identity on
Wall Street - Patrick Harverson examines the strategy of 'Americanisation'
among foreign securities firms in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just after 7am on a winter morning in New York as 30 equity analysts
and salesmen cram into a conference room in the offices of S. G. Warburg,
the UK investment bank.
Almost everyone in the room is American. The only hint that Warburg is a UK
firm is the English voice over the speakerphone - and that is coming from
Hong Kong.
A similar meeting is taking place at the downtown offices of NatWest
Securities, the US offshoot of another UK bank.
As at Warburg, there is little to suggest NatWest is a UK firm. Of the 250
staff in its equities division in New York, only 20 are from the UK. At
Warburg, just 12 of 257 are British.
Like other foreign securities firms seeking to establish a presence in the
US, UK investment banks have adopted a strategy of 'Americanisation'.
Once the New York units were mere outposts, staffed by expatriates eager to
earn their spurs before returning home to promotion. Today, they operate as
US firms in their own right, employing local talent to target niches in
local markets, as well as carrying on the traditional business of selling US
securities to international clients and advising on cross-border
transactions.
The change has been most marked at Warburg and NatWest, two firms that
tried, and mostly failed, in the 1980s and early 1990s to earn respect on
Wall Street.
At NatWest, an attempt to build a US equities business ran into trouble when
the London head office balked at the extent of the New York operation's
independence.
Mr Arthur Kirsch, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert equities chief who had
been hired to run County NatWest Securities (as it was then called), 'did
not want to integrate the US operation with the UK and the rest of the
global network,' explains Mr James O'Donnell, current chief executive of the
New York unit.
Under Mr Kirsch, NatWest also tried to break into mainstream US equities
trading, but with little success against Wall Street competition. Mr Kirsch
left at the end of 1992.
At Warburg, a lack of ambition was the problem. For years, the firm's New
York office had been run by British bankers temporarily posted to the US.
Their lack of knowledge and experience of local markets meant the unit
stayed small, sleepy and not particularly profitable.
After these contrasting experiences, Warburg and NatWest are trying to forge
new identities on Wall Street - and they have set their sights high.
Mr Thomas Wyman, Warburg's chairman in New York, says the US operation has
to build a name for itself on Wall Street if its parent is to prosper as a
global adviser and investment bank.
'Major American corporations don't want to deal with branch offices. They
want to deal with banks,' he says.
Warburg is focusing on three areas: research; domestic and international
sales and trading; and investment banking, particularly underwriting US
stock issues.
Since March 1992, when Mr Ed Olsen was hired from Salomon Brothers to run
Warburg's equities department, the number of US-based analysts has risen
from 14 to 34. Warburg has beefed up its share of trading in foreign and US
stocks and now ranks fifth among firms trading American depositary receipts.
Although it only ranks 25th among Wall Street houses trading New York Stock
Exchange listed issues, its volume of listed business has trebled since
1992.
Warburg has also grown quickly in equity underwriting, albeit from a tiny
base. In 1992, it underwrote four equity deals in the US, lead-managing two.
Last year, it took part in 22 deals, leading 11 - crucially seven of these
were issues of stock by US companies.
Most of these deals were small, however, and few involved big corporate
names. The one headline-grabber was a Dollars 113m equity issue for Cummins
Engine.
Mr Olsen sees further progress in 1994, predicting that by midsummer Warburg
will have passed last year's underwriting total.
One reason for the increased confidence is the new freedom granted by its
parent. Mr Wyman says: 'We have acquired a large measure of self-reliance
and independence.' Crucial decisions, such as how much capital is committed
to equities trading, are now made in New York, not London.
At NatWest Securities, the original problem was too much autonomy. Unlike Mr
Kirsch, however, the current chief executive, Mr O'Donnell, worked for
NatWest in London and has a good relationship with top management there.
NatWest's strategy is two-fold: to become the top non-US equity trading and
underwriting firm on Wall Street, and to develop a profitable business in a
few specialised sectors, such as researching, and underwriting US equities.
It has already climbed from 30th among ADR traders two years ago to ninth.
In equities, it ranks 15th among traders of NYSE-listed securities, the
highest ranking of a non-US firm, excluding the Anglo-American Wertheim
Schroder.
As an underwriter, NatWest was involved in 53 deals worth Dollars 14.6bn
last year, up from 23 worth Dollars 1.4bn in 1992. It lead-managed 47 US
corporate issues, with an average size of more than Dollars 100m.
After all the hiring of staff and aggressive pursuit of new business, are
Warburg and NatWest making money in New York? Neither firm would disclose
details, but Mr Wyman said Warburg's performance was ahead of his
expectations. 'We will be a more than useful contributor to group earnings.'
At NatWest, Mr O'Donnell said revenues in the current fiscal year should be
20 - 30 per cent up on the previous year's Dollars 100m-plus total. His goal
is to take revenues to Dollars 250m over the next two to three years.
But a question remains. Both firms have expanded their US equities business
during a Wall Street boom. What happens when market activity slows, when
institutional investors stop buying and when companies issue less stock?
Both claim that growth is being carefully controlled. But, for the time
being at least, there is so much work to do that neither seems worried about
under-employed staff.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Gencor to pay 5 cents interim
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gencor, the South African mining conglomerate in talks to buy Billiton from
Royal Dutch Shell, has reported distributable profit of R254m (Dollars 73m)
for the four months ended December, the first results since the group sold
its industrial interests last year.
Comparing the results with earlier figures is complicated by Gencor's
disposals and a change in financial year-end from August to June. Pro forma
distributable profit for the year ended August 1993 stood at R612m. Gencor
is paying an interim dividend of 5 cents a share.
Gencor's gold, ferro-alloy and mineral sands businesses performed strongly
thanks largely to improved operating efficiencies and with little help from
commodity prices.
In contrast, investment income was weaker as spending on three large capital
projects - the Alusaf smelter expansion, Columbus Stainless Steel joint
venture, and Oryx gold mine - drained R1bn from cash resources.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said Gencor was two years from enjoying the
strong cash-flow which Alusaf and Columbus would generate once the plants
were commissioned.
In the short term, with only a nervous recovery in some commodities markets,
Gencor would do well to meet its forecast of 37.5 cents a share full-year
earnings.
'Gencor is nevertheless poised for dramatic earnings growth when the
commodity cycle turns, as one day it must,' Mr Gilbertson said.
He added that negotiations over Billiton, which has important aluminium and
nickel assets, were taking longer than expected to conclude.
In buying Billiton, Gencor has the chance of putting together a low-cost
integrated aluminium business which would propel the group to being one of
the world's top five producers.
Chances of a successful negotiation, although complicated by financing
arrangements, were better than ever, the group said, but it was 'willing to
walk away from the deal' if it was not sealed by June 30.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canadian cement group sharply
reduces its losses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, sharply
reduced its losses in 1993.
The group said it expects to be profitable for all of 1994, benefiting from
a stronger Ontario market and better prices in Canada and the north-eastern
US.
Sales rose by 8.6 per cent to CDollars 507m (USDollars 378m) in 1993, helped
by higher spot market sales, while the loss was cut to CDollars 7.8m, or 20
cents a share, compared with a deficit for 1992 of CDollars 39.9m, or 94
cents.
In the final quarter of 1993, St Lawrence showed a profit of CDollars 2m, or
4 cents a share against a loss of CDollars 18.2m, or 43 cents (after a
special provision), a year earlier. Sales advanced by 6 per cent to CDollars
144m.
The company, which is controlled by the Swiss-based Holderbank group, said
it would reap the full benefits of cost reductions and asset restructuring
in 1994-95.

Kyowa Hakko, the Japanese chemicals and drugs group, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits up 4.5 per cent at Y17bn (Dollars 160m). The results were
achieved on sales down 0.6 per cent at Y294bn.
Mr Katuji Kuwabara, managing director, said a substantial sales decline in
chemicals had been more than offset by a robust performance from the
pharmaceuticals, alcohol and food operations. The company reported post-tax
profits up 4.1 per cent at Y6.28bn.
The group predicted pre-tax profits this financial year would be almost flat
at Y17bn on sales up 2.9 per cent at Y303bn. It reckoned operating profits
would be unchanged at Y18.5bn and post-tax profits Y6.3bn.
The company, which is Japan's ninth largest drugs group, said the cuts in
domestic drugs prices due to be implemented in April would reduce its sales
by about Y5bn. Chemical prices were likely to remain low, even if sales
increased, it added. The company said it would raise its research and
development spending by Y1.2bn to Y19.1bn this year.
Meanwhile, Chugai, one of Japan's fastest growing drugs groups, yesterday
warned its sales and profits would slow rapidly this year because of the
government measures to reduce drugs spending.
The company's healthcare sales fell 4.5 per cent last year to Y27.2bn, while
pesticide sales were up 24.8 per cent to Y608m. Overseas sales rose 11.4 per
cent to Y6.4bn.
The group said pre-tax profits would grow only 2.8 per cent this year to
Y17.5bn, compared with a 16.2 per cent increase last year.
Sales would grow only 4.3 per cent to Y158bn, compared with a rise of 5.7
per cent in 1993.

Japanese brewers

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's three leading brewers saw a fall in non-consolidated sales for the
year to December as last year's unusually cool summer and the prolonged
economic downturn stemmed consumer demand for beer and other beverages.
However, profits were mixed as streamlining efforts helped Asahi, while
Sapporo also saw earnings rise on the back of new beer brands.
Kirin, the industry leader, saw declines in profits for the second
consecutive year in spite of a rise in its pharmaceutical sales. Beer sales
fell 1.5 per cent to Y1,307.6bn (Dollars 12.3bn) while its drugs division
posted a 37.7 per cent rise in sales to Y25.6bn. The company saw a 3.3 per
cent fall in after-tax profits to Y36.2bn.
For the current year to December, Kirin expects pre-tax profits to rise 5.2
per cent to Y81bn due to lower material costs on a 3.9 per cent sales rise
to Y1,400bn. On a consolidated basis, the company posted an 8.4 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits for the year to last December to Y87bn on a 1.7 per
cent decline in sales to Y1,574.8bn.
Rationalisation helped Asahi increase profits in spite of its first sales
decline in 14 years. Non-consolidated operating profits for the year to last
December climbed 8.7 per cent and after-tax profits rose 9.6 per cent to
Y4.4bn. However, the rise in pre-tax profits was trimmed to 4.6 per cent at
Y14.6bn due to equity-linked bond redemptions worth Dollars 1bn. The company
also booked a loss of Y1.6bn by liquidating its subsidiaries.
For the full year to next December, Asahi expects a 2.1 per cent rise in
parent pre-tax profits to Y15bn on a rise in sales to Y780bn.
Sapporo was the sole brewer to see an expansion in beer sales last year
thanks to new brands including low calorie beers. The company reported a
sales and pre-tax profits rise for the fourth consecutive year. After-tax
profits rose 48.9 per cent due to a fall in corporate taxes.
For the full year to December, Sapporo expects profits to remain flat at
Y11.1bn on a 4.2 per cent rise in sales to Y595bn.

at nine months

Honda, the Japanese carmaker, suffered a 53.1 per cent decline in pre-tax
profits to Y35.04bn (Dollars 330m) in the first nine months of its financial
year to the end of December.
Honda, which announced this week that it is to sever its 20 per cent equity
link with Rover, the UK carmaker, blamed the fall in profits on the
recession in Japan and Europe and on the strong yen.
Honda's profits have been falling for three years. The strong yen cut group
operating profits by Y103bn in the nine months, the company said. Group
turnover in the period fell by 9.5 per cent to Y2,820bn.
Pre-tax profits in the third quarter to December fell by 31 per cent to
Y12.54bn from Y18.23bn a year earlier, while turnover fell by 2.8 per cent
to Y947.96bn. Operating profits fell by 19 per cent to Y18.5bn from Y23.0bn.
Honda said that the strong yen had reduced operating profits by Y38bn in the
third quarter.
The Japanese carmaker, which was stunned three weeks ago by the takeover by
BMW of British Aerospace's 80 per cent stake in Rover, said yesterday that
it was confident about treading an independent path in Europe.
Mr Shinichi Tanaka, Honda spokesman, said that the company aimed to be
independent in Europe. 'We are confident about pursuing our own way,' said
Mr Tanaka. 'By early 1995 we will have a significant marketing force in
Europe.'
In the early 1980s Honda's entire focus had been on the US and at the time
the company had not been capable of dealing with both the US and with
Europe. The 15-year relationship with Rover had meant that 'we could get
into Europe without sacrificing our operations in the US,' he said.
Honda forecast that its European car sales, including both imported and
locally produced vehicles, would rise by 15.8 per cent to 181,000 in 1994.
The company said that it expected that tax cuts in Japan would boost
domestic sales, but warned that excess stocks in the industry could lead to
heavy discounting.
Honda expected to continue reducing capacity in Japan to cope with lower
demand and with an increasing transfer of manufacturing overseas.
It has been slimming down its operations since 1992 and aims to be able to
break even at a capacity level of 1m units.
Honda said that it expected its car exports in 1994 to fall to 484,000 from
570,728 in 1993, while it forecast a rise in output overseas to 805,000 in
1994 from 677,000 last year.
Honda said it was still on target to meet its forecast of net income of
Y17.3bn in the current financial year, against Y37.1bn a year earlier, on a
turnover of Y3,774bn, compared with Y4,132bn.

BIL GT, the leading banking group in Liechtenstein, has reported a 75 per
cent jump in 1993 consolidated net income to SFr141.3m (Dollars 97.1m) and
proposed raising its dividend from SFr13 to SFr17.
The group, formerly known as Bank in Liechtenstein, said it benefited from a
falling interest rate trend which encouraged investors to shift funds from
short-term instruments to the equity and bond markets.
Total revenues rose 34 per cent to SFr553.3m, with fees and commissions
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total income.
The bank itself achieved record income, and GT Management, the London based
fund management group, had a 'very successful year'.
The group's funds under administration soared 43 per cent to SFr55.2bn.
The directors warned that the exceptional business growth rates of the past
two years were unlikely to be maintained, but said the group had made a
successful start to the current year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transportation group, is selling the bulk of its
shipping and development division - including its 50 per cent interest in
the Condor cross-channel ferries in the UK - for approximately ADollars 125m
(USDollars 89m).
The deal is structured so that a new company, headed by members of the
shipping division's existing management, buys the business. TNT said it
expected to receive ADollars 125.4m from the deal.
Meanwhile, the new company, called Holyman, will raise funds to meet the
bulk of this purchase price by floating some 62m shares on the stock market
to raise ADollars 123.4m.
The sale is conditional on the flotation being completed successfully but if
it proceeds smoothly, Holyman will also take on about ADollars 8m of lease
debt within the business.
The new company will make 35 per cent of the share issue, around 21.6m
shares, available to TNT shareholders and convertible preference
shareholders on a priority basis.
The businesses to be sold are fairly diverse and were acquired by TNT over
the past two decades. They range from the ship-owning and chartering
business in Australia, to the Hydrolines fast ferries, which plough the
Hudson River in New York, the Palm Valley pipeline in the Northern Territory
and a wood-chip trading operation in Queensland.
The sale will not include TNT's 50 per cent interest in the Union Shipping
Group, the Sydney Monorail, or its event merchandising business, called TNT
Leisure.
Holyman said yesterday that it expected revenue in the year to end-December
1994 to be ADollars 39.1m, and net profit to stand at ADollars 12.9m. The
shares are being sold on an earnings multiple of 9.6 times.
The sale is in line with TNT's policy of selling 'non-core' assets, in an
effort to reduce the group's heavy debt levels. In its last annual report,
the group said that it had identified over ADollars 200m worth of assets for
sale during 1993/4 and a further ADollars 150m-ADollars 200m worth which
might be disposed of in the future.

<TEXT>
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics
company, said yesterday that it is giving its wholly-owned subsidiary NL
Finance a grant of Y80bn (Dollars 753m) to help reduce its interest burden
arising from bad loans, writes Our Financial Staff.
A further Y100bn will be made available to the subsidiary in the form of
soft loans.
The grant has forced Matsushita to cut its 1993 - 94 group pre-tax profit
forecast to Y120bn against Y168.35bn in 1992 - 93.
Net profit is expected to fall by 44 per cent on turnover down 7 per cent.
The company reported a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the three
months to end-December to Y47.1bn.
NL Finance was set up in March 1992 to take over the loans of another
Matsushita unit, National Leasing. Its current loan book totals Y340bn.
TDK, the Japanese magnetic tape and components manufacturer, suffered a 46
per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y5.1bn in the three
months to December, from Y9.49bn for the same period a year earlier, AP-DJ
reports from Tokyo.
Net profit was 62 per cent lower at Y1.94bn, compared with Y5.06bn, on sales
of Y116.54bn, 15 per cent down on the year-earlier figure of Y136.52bn.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Deere increases to Dollars 87m
on strong US demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deere &amp; Co, the US agriculture and construction equipment manufacturer, said
strong North American demand boosted first-quarter income to Dollars 87m, or
Dollars 1.02 a share, reversing a year-ago loss before accounting charges of
Dollars 36.9m, or 48 cents.
Sales in the quarter jumped 21 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.4bn
in last year's first quarter. The strong sales enabled Deere's plants to
remain open on full schedules during the quarter, increasing production
tonnage 25 per cent on last year's depressed first quarter. The company's
shares jumped Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 82 1/2 .
Deere's equipment businesses had been expected to benefit from rising farm
income, low interest rates, and a modest economic recovery that has
stimulated new home construction. However, the earnings improvement was far
better than forecast.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said that he expected Deere's 1994 worldwide
production tonnage to rise about 13 per cent over 1993 output. Most of the
production increase will be in Deere's North American equipment operations.
He added that overseas sales of Deere products continued to be relatively
weak, but the company was outperforming the industry.
'First-quarter North American retail sales provide a strong base for
operations during the remainder of the year,' Mr Becherer said.
Despite weather-related shortfalls of corn and soya-bean production, US farm
net cash income is forecast to have achieved record levels in 1993. In
Europe, Mr Becherer said 1994 farm equipment sales were predicted to be no
worse than in 1993.
During the first quarter, Deere's worldwide farm equipment sales jumped 29
per cent to Dollars 887m and sales of industrial and construction equipment
rose 33 per cent to Dollars 308m. Lawn care equipment sales rose 9 per cent
to Dollars 212m.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fourth quarter up 16%, but
growth slows at Wal-Mart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wal-Mart Stores, the biggest US retailer, increased net income by 16 per
cent to Dollars 868m in the fourth quarter to January 31, ending a year in
which the rate of profits growth slowed significantly.
Net income for the year was 17 per cent ahead at Dollars 2.33bn, on sales 21
per cent ahead at Dollars 67.34bn. This produced a 17 per cent increase in
earnings per share to Dollars 1.02.
In the previous five years, earnings per share grew at an average 25 per
cent a year, and in the five years before that averaged 36 per cent. Some
analysts believe the latest figures reflect an inevitable maturing of the
company's rapid development.
Last spring the shares were re-rated downwards, as the market adjusted to
the prospect of a decline in earnings growth. Shares yesterday were Dollars
 1/2 ahead at Dollars 28 1/4 , compared with a 12-month high of Dollars 34.
Although the pace slowed, Wal-Mart pointed out it was positioned for further
expansion. During the year it added 143 new Wal-Mart stores and 164 Sam's
Club membership warehouses, 99 of which were Pace clubs acquired from the
rival Kmart stores group.
It has also expanded geographically, partly through its joint venture with
the Cifra retailing group in Mexico and partly through last month's
acquisition of Woolworth's 120 Woolco stores in Canada, which are to be
converted to the Wal-Mart format.
Fourth-quarter sales were 19 per cent ahead at Dollars 20.36bn, and earnings
per share rose 13 per cent to 38 cents.

<TEXT>
Canon, the Japanese camera and office equipment maker, has agreed to use US
computer group IBM's PowerPC microprocessor technology in future computer
products, and will help refine technology for use in consumer products and
hand-held devices.
The Canon endorsement represents a breakthrough for IBM, which aims to
establish PowerPC as an industry standard competing with Intel's dominant
microprocessor technology. Canon is the first computer systems manufacturer,
other than Apple and IBM itself, to adopt PowerPC as a strategic technology.
Canon is not, however, a big participant in the personal computer market and
the agreement does not include any plans for Canon to incorporate PowerPC in
its widely used printers, cameras or copying machines, IBM said.
IBM said that it has distributed about 800 PowerPC 'reference
specifications' to companies exploring the use of the technology. The
agreement with Canon 'may be the first of many,' a spokesman said.

BoM is the first of Canada's big six banks to report for the first quarter

improvements and peak profits by their brokerage subsidiaries.
BoM's net profit was CDollars 197m (USDollars 147m), or 72 cents a share, up
from CDollars 155m, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Return on common equity was

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ranger Oil profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Ranger Oil, the Calgary-based oil and gas developer and producer with
interests in Western Canada, the US, North Sea and South West Africa,
reported net profit of USDollars 20.2m, or 21 cents a share, for 1993, down
from Dollars 23.5m, or 24 cents in 1992.
The decline was due to lower tax recoveries stemming from reduced North Sea
exploration, partly offset by lower expenses.
Daily oil output was little changed at 13,800 barrels, but gas output rose
to 113m cu ft daily from 94.1m, due to the start-up of the Markham gasfield
in the southern North Sea and new finds in North America.
Net capital spending was Dollars 111m in 1993, down from Dollars 61m in
1992, including an acquisition.
Ranger has just announced results from a successful well 115 miles east of
Aberdeen. Another well is planned late this year directly to the north.
Homestake Mining of the US is to develop the Eskay Creek gold-silver mine in
northern British Columbia for about CDollars 75m (USDollars 55m). Start-up
is planned for next January.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Macy in rescue talks to block
Federated

<TEXT>
R H Macy, the US department store group that has been operating under
chapter 11 protection from its creditors for more than two years, yesterday
said it had started talks with General Electric Capital and Fidelity
Investments about a possible rescue.
The rescue could block a rival move by Federated Department Stores group,
owner of the Bloomingdale's department stores, which has procured a slice of
Macy's secured debt with the aim of taking over the company.
GE Capital, an investment subsidiary of General Electric, is already one of
Macy's principal shareholders, while Fidelity Investments, a company that
takes stakes in potential bankruptcy turnrounds, holds Dollars 490m worth of
Macy's bank debt.
Late yesterday, Macy won a four-month extension of the time during which it
has the exclusive right to come up with a reorganisation plan. A federal
bankruptcy court appointed Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of state,
to mediate.
Macy is now expected to continue discussions with GE Capital and Fidelity in
the hope of engineering a rescue that will preserve the group's continuing
independence under the existing management.
Federated has made clear it wants to merge Macy's 111 stores with its own.
Its position as a creditor gives it the power to veto any rival scheme - but
if Macy and its allies come up with a plan that pays off Federated's debt,
Federated will cease to have any role in the proceedings.
ConAgra, which for years financed acquisitions with stock, says it is more
likely to pay cash, Reuter reports.
Mr Stephen Key, executive vice-president and chief financial officer,
yesterday told analysts that ConAgra, the nation's largest independent food
company, would be comfortable with acquisitions exceeding Dollars 1bn,
combining cash flow and debt capacity.

<TEXT>
Mr Laurie Cox, chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), said
yesterday that it had decided not to allow companies to issue shares with
differential voting rights but would adhere to the 'one share, one vote
principle'.
Whether the ASX should relax its listing rules became controversial last
year after Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation said that it wanted to issue
a tranche of new shares with multiple or 'super' voting rights.
News Corp is one of the biggest and most heavily traded stocks on the ASX
and there were fears that, if the ASX did not meet its request, the company
would move its listing to another international exchange where the rules
were less constricting. Companies are able to issue shares with differential
voting rights on the New York Stock Exchange.
However, News Corp's request for a change was fiercely opposed by local
institutional investors, who feared that it could encourage dubious
practices and undermine shareholder rights. Although News Corp withdrew its
scheme voluntarily, the ASX said it would still make a decision on the
principle involved.
'In deciding not to change its listing rules, the ASX board had taken into
account that the present listing rule providing for one share-one vote for
ordinary shares, coupled with the ASX's power to administer the rule
flexibly, had served the need of the Australian capital market well,' said
Mr Cox.
Mr Cox added that the ASX will issue an exposure draft, available by June,
setting out guidelines for the criteria it will use in administering the
relevant listing rule.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: May beats forecast with Dollars
711m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
May Department Stores, the leading US department store group, ended its year
to January 29 with net earnings of Dollars 711m, an increase of 18 per cent
over the previous year's Dollars 603m.
The figure was comfortably ahead of the 11-13 per cent target for annual
earnings growth that Mr David Farrell, the chairman and chief executive, set
for the group over the next five years at an analysts' meeting last October.
Fourth-quarter sales rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 3.57bn while net earnings
rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 365m and fully diluted earnings per share
advanced by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.37.
Full-year sales also rose by 8 per cent, to Dollars 11bn, and fully-diluted
earnings per share rose by 17 per cent to Dollars 2.65.
May said that during the year it opened 13 new department stores and 216
Payless ShoeSource stores as part of its five-year plan to add 100
department stores and 1,200 Payless ShoeSource stores. These represented an
extra 2.7m sq ft of retail space.
The group had also benefited from the consolidation of its department store
operations into four divisions, which had lowered costs, and from the
related closure of some low-productivity stores.

Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), Portugal's biggest retail banking group,
yesterday reported a 16.3 per cent increase in consolidated net profits in
1993 to Es23.5bn (Dollars 134m). Net assets for the group rose 52.4 per cent
to Es3,426bn.
BPA plans to seek shareholder approval in March for a rights issue that
would increase share capital from Es100bn to Es110bn. A dividend of Es132
per share, 10 per cent higher than in 1992, was announced.
The group also plans capital increases for Uniao de Bancos Portugueses, a
retail bank in which BPA bought a controlling stake in 1993, and for Banco
Comercial de Macau, the third bank in the group.
Despite recession last year, the amount of credit extended by BPA increased
51.7 per cent to Es1,452bn and deposits grew 61.1 per cent to Es2,056bn.
Trading in government debt securities earned the group Es961bn, up 51.3 per
cent.
The third stage of the privatisation of BPA later this year will reduce the
state holding to about 25 per cent. This stake will be further diluted by
the planned capital increase, in which the state is not expected to
participate.
Celulose do Caima, one of Portugal's four big paper pulp producers,
yesterday announced a loss of Es5.5bn for 1993, which it described as one of
the worst years ever for the industry worldwide.
The loss, which compares with a loss of Es1bn in 1992, included an
extraordinary cost of Es4.3bn for the closure of one of the company's two
main production centres because of excess capacity in a depressed market.

Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, yesterday reported a 28 per cent
increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 181.2m, following strong
contributions from its investment banking and securities trading businesses.
The final quarter took profits for the fiscal year 1993 to Dollars 786.1m,
compared with Dollars 510.5m the previous year.
Net revenues for the final quarter were up 33 per cent to Dollars 925.4m,
and for the full year up 38 per cent to Dollars 4.16bn.
In the latest quarter, Morgan Stanley's principal trading business - trading
securities for itself and its customers - was especially strong, with
revenues rising 83 per cent to Dollars 286.1m.
During the year, the bank said results from customer-related global
fixed-income and equity businesses and commodities and foreign exchange
trading were particularly positive.
Investment banking revenue in the fourth quarter rose only 7.5 per cent to
Dollars 244.9m, but over the year it increased 28 per cent to Dollars
1.24bn, as debt and equity underwriting volume and growth in demand for
financial and advisory services both rose.
Among its merchant banking deals during 1993, Morgan Stanley singled out the
revenues generated by the initial public offering of Southern Pacific
Railroad and the second offering of Kohl's Corporation stock.
Commission revenues in the quarter rose 35 per cent to Dollars 110.1m, and
earnings from asset management and administration climbed 54 per cent to
Dollars 74.8m.
On the cost side, non-interest expenses rose 35 per cent in the three months
to Dollars 677.7m, due primarily to a sharp rise in employee compensation
payments, which are linked to the firm's profitability.
Morgan Stanley also announced an 11 per cent increase in its regular
quarterly dividend to 30 cents, and plans for an additional Dollars 150m
buy-back of common stock.
During fiscal 1993, the firm strengthened its capital base through issues of
new long-term debt and convertible preferred stock. As of January 31, its
capital stood at Dollars 9.8bn.
Yesterday's results had little impact upon the bank's share price, which was
unchanged at Dollars 70 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, and Snia, a subsidiary of Fiat of
Italy, are to pool their engineering plastics operations in a joint venture.
The move, announced yesterday by the two companies, is designed to
strengthen their position in a depressed sector. It is the latest step in a
process of combining and rationalising their fibres and polymers activities.
Last year, Snia and Rhone-Poulenc set up a 50-50 joint venture in carpet and
poly-amide fibres. Earlier this year, they established a venture in
polyamide textile yarn, which is used in the manufacture of stockings.
The new company, which will be called Nyltech, will also be a 50-50 joint
venture and will pool all of the engineering plastics operations of
Rhone-Poulenc and Caffaro, a division of Snia. Engineering plastics are
highly resistant to heat and are used in a range of industrial products,
including automotive and aircraft components.
The new company will have annual sales of about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 205.5m)
and will employ about 800 people.
It will be based in Lyon, involving the relocation of current employees but
no significant job cuts, according to Rhone-Poulenc. All of the production
sites and technical centres will be included in the joint venture.
According to Rhone-Poulenc, the venture will allow greater efficiency in
production and marketing. Research and development costs will be shared,
marketing costs will be reduced, and product ranges will be combined.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares slide on
fears of restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, fell yesterday, losing
FFr2.05 to close at FFr34.75, as investors anticipated that debt
restructuring talks would involve a significant capital increase.
Negotiations between Euro Disney, its creditor banks, and Walt Disney, the
US entertainment group which holds 49 per cent of the European leisure
company, are expected to start within the next week.
A report on Euro Disney's financial situation and commercial strategy,
prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group, has been sent to
creditor banks, clearing the way for restructuring talks.
According to the report, Euro Disney requires a capital increase of between
FFr12bn and FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to ease the burden of its FFr20.3bn
debt. 'The need for a big capital increase has been obvious for a while and
was spelt out in the preliminary audit report,' said one industry analyst.
'But the clearing of the way for serious negotiations has probably focused
attention on the implications concerning the dilution of earnings.'
Although details of the audit have not been disclosed, it is thought to
endorse many of the principal elements of a new strategy drawn up by Mr
Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney chairman.
This strategy includes a series of measures aimed at cutting costs and
increasing sales. Seasonal pricing schemes have been introduced for
admission to the theme park and for its hotels. At low season, for example,
hotel prices for four people range from between FFr400 and FFr1,600 per
night. Restaurants now provide less expensive meals, and there is an
emphasis on cheaper products, below FFr150, in the theme park's shops.
Euro Disney says it has also targeted its marketing efforts on areas with
greatest potential, such as London, Munich and the border areas between
France and Germany.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Glaverbel, the Belgian glassmaker, yesterday said rising selling prices in
North America and Europe, and tighter control of financial costs, had helped
it to reduce the heavy losses of the first half of 1993.
The net loss at Glaverbel, Europe's third-largest flat glass producer, was
BFr2.06bn (Dollars 58.4m) in 1993, compared with a BFr715 profit in 1992.
However, BFr1.78bn of this loss was incurred in the first half of the year.
The improved performance in the second half meant losses here were kept to
BFr154m.
Glaverbel blamed its poor performance in the first half on falling prices,
an extensive programme of redundancies and restructuring, and the heavy
losses at AFG Industries, its North American subsidiary.
Overall sales in 1993 reached BFr30.75bn, down 7.2 per cent on the previous
year.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Handelsbanken back to black as
loan losses fall
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Svenska Handelsbanken yesterday confirmed its position as the most resilient
of the Nordic region's crisis-hit banks, reporting a surge back into the
black to an operating profit of SKr1.8bn (Dollars 230m) in 1993 from a loss
in 1992 of SKr840m.
A 12 per cent rise in operating income, to SKr14.14bn, and a 15 per cent
fall in loan losses, to SKr6.8bn, produced the turnround. Combined with a
SKr2.6bn rights issue last October, the profits strengthened the bank's
capital adequacy ratio to 12.9 per cent, comfortably above the international
minimum level of 8 per cent. Two Swedish banks, Nordbanken and Gota Bank,
plunged below that level in 1992.
Handelsbanken said it would pay its dividend, omitted last year, at SKr2 a
share for both A and B shares.
However, the Stockholm stock market, which long ago discounted a speedy
recovery in the banking sector, was unimpressed. Analysts said the
Handelsbanken result was at the low end of expectations, and its B shares
fell SKr4 yesterday to close at SKr128.
Handelsbanken said a 10 per cent rise in net interest income to SKr9.9bn,
fuelled by lower market interest rates and a shift to Swedish kronor lending
from foreign currency, helped push up total income. Commission income fell 3
per cent, to SKr2.8bn, as a 66 per cent rise in investment banking fees was
offset by a crash in foreign currency-related fees, which were at record
levels in 1992.
The biggest increase in income, however, came from realised profits on
investment bonds. These were SKr537m, against SKr150m last time. Income from
property seized as collateral for bad loans also soared, to SKr313m from
SKr59m.
The SKr6.8bn in loan losses - most attributed to real estate  - amounted to
2.2 per cent of the total loan portfolio, down from 2.5 per cent, and
significantly below the average in the Swedish banking sector. Problem loans
after provisions for possible loan losses of SKr6.87bn were down 26 per cent
at SKr9.7bn.
Total expenses were up 2 per cent at SKr5.4bn. However, Handelsbanken
attributed the rise to a SKr114m allocation made to a staff profit-sharing
foundation. Under a long-standing agreement, this can take up to one-third
of the value paid in dividends to shareholders if Handelsbanken's result is
better than the average of other listed banks in Sweden.

A strong performance from its Wilson Sporting Goods arm enabled Amer, the
Finnish consumer group, to raise profits sharply in 1993.
The group made a profit of FM118m (Dollars 21.2m) in the 10 months to
December 31 1993, up 62 per cent from FM73m in the same 1992 period.
Pro-forma profits for the whole of 1993 were FM119m, compared with a FM7m
loss in 1992. The company is changing its fiscal year to the calendar year.
The weaker Finnish markka flattered full-year sales, which climbed to
FM7.66bn from FM6.75bn. Excluding currencies, sales were down 3 per cent
because of recession in key markets.
Operating profit rose to FM366m from FM290m, as the contribution from Wilson
helped to offset weaker performances from the group's paper, tobacco and
publishing divisions.
Wilson, which is strong in the US, doubled operating profits to FM245m as
the benefits of new products, marketing and a cost-cutting drive started to
show through.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: First Pacific places Dutch
investment

<TEXT>
First Pacific, the Hong Kong investment group, yesterday sold its entire
43.2 per cent stake in Internatio-Muller, the Dutch trading and technical
installation company, through a private placement.
The 2.4m shares, placed by a syndicate led by ING Bank of the Netherlands,
were sold to institutions in the UK, continental Europe and eastern Asia at
a price of Fl 86.50 each, a discount of Fl 2.20 to Monday's closing price.
The Fl 208m (Dollars 108.3m) transaction comes nearly three years after
First Pacific stunned the Dutch business community by revealing it had built
up the stake. The investment was the first step in what ultimately proved to
be an unsuccessful attempt to merge Internatio-Muller with Hagemeyer, a
Dutch-based trading company majority-owned by First Pacific.
After First Pacific unveiled its large minority holding in Internatio-Muller
in May 1991, the Dutch company responded with an emergency issue of
preference shares to a friendly company-related foundation, thereby diluting
its Hong Kong suitor's voting rights.
Internatio-Muller said yesterday it may now ask shareholders to authorise
the withdrawal of these preference shares when they meet in May.
The timing of the divestment allows First Pacific to benefit from the recent
strength of the Amsterdam stock exchange, where Internatio-Muller's shares
have been trading near 12-month highs. The Dutch company's shares were
trading at well below Fl 80 when First Pacific was building up its stake in
early 1991.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of heavy loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mannesmann, the German engineering group, said yesterday it would report a
substantial loss in 1993.
Without quantifying the loss, it said in its preliminary review of the 1993
financial year that the group had suffered from the continuing weakness of
the world economy. Restructuring measures and adverse currency movements had
also taken their toll.
The economic downturn had hit customer demand, Mannesmann said, and led to
sharp price falls in certain sectors of the business, especially the steel
tubes activities. Turnover for the group was stagnant, up slightly to
DM28.04bn (Dollars 16.5bn) from DM28.02bn, while order intake rose by 1 per
cent, from DM27.76bn to DM27.94bn.
Income from the telecommunications business, which comprises the D2 cellular
telephone network operated by the group's Mobilfunk subsidiary, increased
from DM138m to DM902m. Investors' excitement about the potential for this
operation drove the shares up 86 per cent last year.
Restructuring measures led to a significant reduction in the group's
break-even point and enhanced productivity, Mannesmann said. This had
strengthened the group's international competition. During the year, the
workforce fell 6 per cent to 127,861.
Mannesmann indicated that only one of its six divisions made a profit in
1993. However, while machine tools achieved a positive result, the figure
was down heavily from 1992, on sales down 2 per cent to DM12.47bn. There was
an especially high loss in automotive components, where restructuring
charges were high. Turnover here fell 7 per cent to DM6.08bn.
Electrical engineering and electronics fell into a loss, partly reflecting
outlays on large orders which have yet to produce any income.
The traditional steel pipes business reported a large loss, while start-up
losses in the telecommunications division were reduced.

Net asset value at Temple Bar Investment Trust, taking prior charges at par,
rose 23.6 per cent from 310.9p to 384.17p over the 1993 year.
The performance was in line with the trust's benchmark - the FT-SE-A
All-Share Index - which improved 23.4 per cent over the 12 months.
Attributable revenue dipped to Pounds 7.67m (Pounds 7.82m), reflecting a
full term interest cost on the trust's Pounds 25m debenture issue and
'continued weak dividend growth in the UK'.
A lower tax charge helped restrict the decline in earnings per share to
13.319p (13.57p).
A recommended final distribution of 8.95p lifts the total for the year to
13.55p.

<TEXT>
Regina, the USM-traded Royal Jelly products company, slipped back into the
red in the second six months and for the full year to August 31 ran up a
loss of Pounds 224,000 at the pre-tax level.
That was a marked improvement on the previous year's deficit of Pounds 1.23m
and was scored from turnover marginally higher at Pounds 2.05m (Pounds
1.91m).
Losses per share were cut from 0.91p to 0.18p.
In the opening half year sales were ahead of budget, primarily because of
stocking up by the new UK and Singapore distributors. Profits for the period
amounted to Pounds 143,000.
However, Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, chairman and chief executive, said it was not
possible to sustain the sales increase in the second six months.
Looking ahead, he said the Japanese market showed 'great growth potential'.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pifco advances 18% despite patchy consumer
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pifco, the manufacturer of small appliances, announced an 18 per cent
increase in half year profits despite patchy consumer spending and difficult
trading conditions in Europe.
The Manchester-based group saw pre-tax profits increase to Pounds 1.22m
(Pounds 1.03m) in the six months to October 31.
Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said the rise had been achieved despite lower
sales on products marketed under brands names including Russell Hobbs,
Salton and Carmen.
'Our market share has fallen off in the past year, but we've gone for
profitability rather than volume sales,' he said.
Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 20.4m) as retailers cut
prices in a bid to kick start consumer spending.
Faced with erratic demand for so-called hard goods - ranging from toasters
and kettles to hair dryers and Christmas lights - the company has embarked
on a new strategy to maximise sales.
The Pifco and Salton brands have been repositioned to exploit the budget
market, while some Russell Hobbs, Tower and Carmen products have been
redefined as higher priced 'premium' goods.
'We're looking to regain market share with revised brands,' Mr Webber added.
The company, which ended the half year with a net cash balance of Pounds
2.3m (Pounds 100,000), said it was also considering acquisitions in the UK
and continental Europe.
Mr James Wallace, finance director, said such acquisitions would probably be
funded by a rights issue and would aim to increase exports, currently 23 per
cent of sales.
'We're looking for well-run businesses in our core industry. We can do so
because cash generation has been strong and we've kept costs under control,'
he said.
Earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 7.1p (5.9p). The interim dividend is
1.9p, up 9 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Finelist raises Pounds 15.9m in flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finelist, the vehicle components distributor, yesterday announced a placing
price of 130p to raise Pounds 15.9m from its forthcoming flotation.
Most of the funds raised by the placing, involving 12.2m ordinary shares,
will be realised by the current management and venture capital shareholders,
3i and NatWest Ventures, which together helped the company build up its
portfolio of 73 UK outlets.
Mr Chris Swan, chairman, said existing investors would be selling 7.97m
shares worth Pounds 10.4m, of which management shareholders are expected to
receive Pounds 3.5m. Following the flotation, directors and their families
will retain a 21.1 per cent stake - held mostly by Mr Swan, who expects to
control 19 per cent.
The company, trading principally under the Autela name, will receive Pounds
4.9m, of which Pounds 2.9m will be used to reduce gearing and redeem
preference and A ordinary shares. 'The remaining Pounds 2m will be used to
expand. We have the infrastructure and people in place to handle another 20
sites,' Mr Swan said yesterday.
He predicted that pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 would reach Pounds
2.3m, well ahead of the previous year's Pounds 1m.
COMMENT
Brokers BZW and sponsors NatWest Markets have opted for a price below the
prevailing rate for the distributor sector, so analysts expect a premium on
first day dealings next Monday. Although the placing leaves Finelist with a
relatively modest Pounds 2m to play with, the company - valued at Pounds
28.3m - should emerge from the process debt free and well placed to expand.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline pays Pounds 23m for coach
operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Badgerline yesterday announced its largest acquisition and the first since
it came to the market last November.
The bus company is paying Pounds 23m for PMT Group, the Staffordshire-based
coach operator.
Badgerline, which has operations in the Midlands, south Wales and the south
of England, has grown rapidly through acquisition since a Pounds 3m
management buy-out from the National Bus Company in 1986.
The deal marks its first move into the Staffordshire and Cheshire area.
It came to the market last year at 115p with a market value of Pounds 99.3m.
The shares closed up 5p at 124p yesterday.
Badgerline is paying Pounds 7m in cash, Pounds 8m in loan notes and Pounds
8m in shares for PMT. Debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds will rise
to 168 per cent on a pro forma basis.
However, net assets were expected to be some Pounds 2.7m higher than the pro
forma figures and gearing was expected to be closer to 150 per cent after
the acquisition.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman, said he expected the acquisition to be
earnings enhancing in the current year. PMT made pre-tax profits of Pounds
3m on sales of Pounds 26m for the year to December 31. Pro forma net assets
were Pounds 3.3m.
Mr Mike Moors, former chairman of PMT, will hold 5.4 per cent of the
enlarged group. Mr Smallwood will remain the largest shareholder with 6.6
per cent.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Partco plans sharp gearing reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partco, Britain's largest independent distributor of automotive parts and
equipment, said yesterday it planned to cut gearing in half and repay Pounds
13.4m of preference shares following its flotation next month.
The Northampton-based group predicted its placing and intermediaries offer
would raise Pounds 25m, giving the company a market value of Pounds 50m.
Mr Chris Scott, finance director, said funds raised by the float would
enable the group to repay preference shares issued to institutional
investors as part of the 1986 buy-out from Quinton Hazell, the 1989 purchase
of GKN Autoparts and a refinancing package in 1991.
'After repaying the prefence shares, we will reduce gearing by more than
Pounds 2m and use the remainder to strengthen the balance sheet,' he said.
The company, which delivers branded and own label products to business
customers from a 210-branch network, said the placing would also enable it
to proceed with expansion plans that could see it double in size over the
next few years.
Mr Peter Redfern, managing director, said its ability to pursue that course
was underlined by a sharp improvement in profits.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 4.28m (Pounds 2.05m) in 1993,
while turnover increased 5 per cent to Pounds 124.3m. Operating profits rose
to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.5m), and gross margins were 34.3 per cent.
The group announced earnings per share of 11.6p (3.1p) and a 2.9p dividend -
the first in three years.
COMMENT
Independent garages like one-stop shopping and Partco has gained 45,000
customers as a result. Although it over-extended itself with the Pounds
22.7m GKN acquisition in 1989 and was forced to resort to refinancing during
the recession, it is coming to the market at a time when garages and fleet
operators are consolidating orders with a few national suppliers. Even
though some of the original backers want out, the company should have enough
cash to begin its ambitious expansion strategy and keep gearing at
manageable levels.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Graham sets float price at 183p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Group, the builders' merchant, yesterday ann-ounced a price of 183p
per share for its March flotation - earning Pounds 209.8m before expenses
for BTR, the industrial conglomerate which has been seeking to reduce debt
by disposals.
About 65 per cent of the 114.6m shares are to be placed with institutions.
The prospectus, issued yesterday, shows a notional annual net dividend of
4.6p, for a yield of 3.1 per cent at the offer price.
Earnings, adjusted for management charges incurred under BTR, amounted to
9.1p in 1993.
The prospectus also showed a cash outflow of Pounds 17.9m for the year to
end-December 1993, against an inflow of Pounds 15.5m, from operating
activities before capital expenditure of Pounds 34.3m (Pounds 3m).
Mr Bob Elsmore, finance director, said the turnround was due to increased
stocks to meet greater demand, non-recurring items arising from the demerger
and early repayment of creditors.
Mr Ian Mills, managing director, stressed the opportunities for Graham in a
recovering market, with its 148 national branches and exposure to both the
heavier side of merchanting, such as timber and bricks, as well as the
lighter plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms businesses.
Graham's independent status would also allow it to focus on improving
margins through a better mix of product and investing in refurbishment.
About Pounds 36m was budgeted for investment until 1996, which Mr Mills said
should be funded by 'our own resour-ces'.
Graham is the UK's fourth largest builders' merchant.
The group, which compares itself to Travis Perkins and Wolseley as both have
heavy and light businesses, is coming to the market on a historic multiple
of 17.4.
After adjusting for BTR's charges, the p/e rises to 20.1. Analysts are
forecasting operating profits for 1994 of about Pounds 19m, against Pounds
15.3m last year, and earnings of about 9.9p, leaving a prospective p/e of
about 18.5.
COMMENT
Graham is likely to be popular with investors, mostly because of its
exposure to the recovering housing market. While it may not be offering an
overly generous yield, investors are likely to focus on the recovery
potential to 1996. It would appear that much can be done quickly to improve
performance, which has been hindered by a lack of investment under its
former parent. The shares are expected to trade on a premium to the offer
price while the new approach is being rolled out.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 40m tag on Appld Distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applied Distribution Group, formed five years ago as the result of a Pounds
16.5m management buy-out of Geest's contract distribution business,
yesterday published the pathfinder for its proposed flotation next month.
The company, which is planning to come to market via a placing likely to
value the group at about Pounds 40m, also reported a 27 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.23m on turnover which grew to Pounds 26.5m
(Pounds 21.4m) in 1993.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.4m). Since 1991 the
group, which provides third-party warehousing and distribution services
mainly to retailers and food manufacturers, has increased its turnover and
operating profits by 44 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.
The group, which has invested a further Pounds 4.5m since the MBO and repaid
Pounds 6.25m of debt, has benefited from the growing outsourcing trend among
UK retailers and manufacturers to contract out their warehousing and
transport needs.
Applied Distribution's main customers include J Sainsbury,
Somerfield/Gateway, Nestle, Esso, Whitworth's Produce and the Co-operative
Wholesale Society. It operates nationally from five depots.
The group is planning to use the net proceeds of the placing to repay Pounds
11m of debt.
The placing is being organised by Baring Brothers with NatWest Wood
Mackenzie as brokers to the issue. Pricing is on March 10 and trading is
expected to begin on March 17.

which owns the Holiday Inn hotel in Lisbon.
The Es2.5bn (Pounds 9.7m) sale and other asset disposals are part of the
plan Buckingham has agreed with its bankers to give a period of stability in
which to reduce borrowings by October 31 1994.
Part of that plan involves loan stock holders sanctioning the payment of the

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Radstone Technology heads for stock market
with valuation of Pounds 19.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Radstone Technology, a specialist electronics group which is
coming to market through a placing with institutional investors, were priced
at 125p yesterday, valuing the group at Pounds 19.2m.
The placing, sponsored by Beeson Gregory, involves about 10m shares,
representing two thirds of the group's expanded share capital.
Radstone, which designs and manufactures advanced computer sub-systems for
industrial and military use, was founded in May 1988 as the result of a
Pounds 4.1m management buy-out from Plessey led by Mr Charles Paterson,
Radstone's managing director.
The MBO team, which raised an additional Pounds 3.9m of financing, was
backed by a syndicate of venture capitalist investors led by 3i. The placing
includes 4.09m shares placed on behalf of existing shareholders.
The placing will also raise about Pounds 7m net of new funds for the group,
of which Pounds 3.9m will be used to repay convertible stock, leaving the
group with a strong balance sheet and no gearing.
Radstone, which pioneered the design and production of off-the-shelf
computer boards for use in extreme environments, has three operating
divisions - military products, industrial products and Foundation
Technology, a specialist surface mount technology board assembler which was
acquired in 1991.
The group has manufacturing operations in Towcester and Corby and
subsidiaries in the US and France.
Radstone reported profits before exceptionals of Pounds 985,000 on turnover
of Pounds 25.9m in the year to end-March 1993. Pre-tax profits were Pounds
1.87m. The board is forecasting profits before tax and Pounds 150,000 of
exceptional items of not less than Pounds 1.5m in the current year and
adjusted earnings per share of 7.9p. The shares are expected to begin
trading on February 28.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Rothschild looks to China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NM Rothschild is to set up a representative office in Shanghai to build up
its corporate finance and bullion finance operations in China.
The company has received approval from the People's Bank of China, and the
office will open next month.
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman, said: 'Rothschilds began doing business
in China 150 years ago. Conditions have never been more promising.'
Rothschild, in an alliance with Smith New Court, its 26.5 per cent-owned
associate, was one of the first merchant banks to compete for mandates for B
shares - China-listed shares that could be owned by foreign investors.
The merchant bank is keen to participate in financing bullion projects in
China, an area where foreign involvement is soon expected to be allowed.
The office will employ only a small number of staff, but its primary aim
will be to raise the bank's profile in Shanghai, which is rapidly evolving
as China's new financial centre.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Seeking Pounds 1bn for organic growths -
The prospects for the development of the biotechnology sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British biotechnology sector is looking to raise Pounds 1bn from the
stock market over the next three years, more than the total equity
investment in the sector to date.
According to a new survey by Arthur Andersen, the accountants, and the
BioIndustry Association, the independent biotechnology sector is planning a
large shift from private and venture capital funding to the stock market.
Following last year's change in the Stock Exchange's listing rules for
research-based businesses there have been a flood of biotechnology
flotations. The survey, published today, suggests there are many more in the
pipeline.
Mr David Kirk, head of Andersen's technology group, says it is an open
question whether the stock market can absorb the number of potential new
issues and warns that investor sentiment remains vulnerable to
disappointment.
'One hopes there is the appetite, but one catastrophe could upset the
sector.'
The survey shows that less than half of the UK's biotechnology companies
believe they have sufficient financial resources to pursue their long-term
strategic goals.
In particular, they may have to drop their ambitions to become fully
integrated companies which market the products they have developed.
One of the survey's most interesting findings is that 43 per cent of
companies plan to become fully integrated. For a further 34 per cent the
strategy is to use partners either for marketing or manufacture.
The report states: 'The objective of full integration may well be reasonable
for the UK's most successful companies. However, as more companies reach the
expensive product development phase of their growth, so the competition for
available funds will increase and many may have to revise their strategy.'
Excluding the biotechnology arms of larger companies, Andersen identified
166 companies 'whose primary commercial activity depends on the application
of biological organisms, systems or processes'. The sector, which employs
7,400 people and spent Pounds 130m on research and development last year,
has been funded by about Pounds 900m of equity up October 31.
Based on the responses to a questionnaire Andersen calculates that the
sector is looking for Pounds 1.1bn of equity over the next three years. The
total demand is likely to be greater still given that this figure applies
only to existing businesses, and that more than a quarter of the companies
in the survey are less than five years old.
To date, the vast majority of equity funding has come from private
individuals or venture capitalists. But the companies expected 84 per cent
of future equity funding to come from public markets.
Most companies said that they had found it difficult to raise finance and
believed that the City generally had a negative attitude to biotechnology.
They blamed this on the perceived lack of commercial experience of the
companies' managements and the lack of exit routes for investors.
The problem arises because the typical four to six year investment period,
over which most venture capital firms work, is not long enough to see a
biotechnology company to flotation. Until the Stock Exchange changed its
rules companies could not, other than in exceptional cases, come to market
without a history of mainstream revenues.
The recent relaxation means companies can float earlier so bridging what
Andersen calls the 'realisation gap'.
Mr Vernon Spencer of Andersen's biotechnology group, believes the change
will ease the funding problems of start-ups as well as more mature
companies. 'If venture capital companies are getting money out through
flotations they are more likely to invest it back at the start of the
cycle.'
The biotechnology sector had turnover of Pounds 470m in 1992-93 which, based
on the companies' own estimates, will have nearly doubled to Pounds 878m in
1995-96. Yet the strength of the product development pipeline indicates even
faster growth after that with research and development spending set to rise
by half to Pounds 202m in 1995-96. However, to put this in context, Glaxo
alone is likely to spend about Pounds 200m on research this year with a
further Pounds 600m-Pounds 700m on development.
Mr Kirk believes that the UK industry is at a turning point. 'There were
positive developments on a wide range of fronts last year including finance,
regulation and the intellectual property environment.' However, the report
concludes that further change in all these areas is required to capitalise
on the UK's 'excellent reputation for biotechnological innovation'.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: LWT's final salvo in bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LWT yesterday fired the final salvo in its defence from Granada's Pounds
800m bid by underlining the management's confidence in its growth prospects
as an independent company.
In a letter to shareholders Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, said:'LWT's
board and senior management are confident that the Granada offer fails to
reflect the future earnings potential of the company. This confidence is
based on an outstanding record, a strong start to 1994, and a detailed
understanding of the television industry.'
Referring to the management's large stake in the company he added:'We are
backing our judgement with over Pounds 75m invested in LWT.'
A spokesman for Granada replied: 'They passed the point of indifference in
terms of their personal wealth some time ago.' Sir Christopher accused
Granada of 'trying to scare' LWT into accepting by suggesting that the LWT
share price would be vulnerable if the bid failed.
But Sir Christopher pointed to the re-rating of the sector over the last
three months which has seen three bids and the proposed subscription by
Flextech for 20 per cent of HTV.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Unilever restructuring foods and detergents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full-year figures from Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group,
were dominated by unexpectedly large restructuring costs of Pounds 490m.
Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said the charges would be concentrated on foods
and detergents, with North America carrying a disproportionate share.
Of the total, 57 per cent will be incurred in Europe and 37 per cent in
North America. By product division, 37 per cent will come in food, 37 per
cent in detergents, 14 per cent in personal products and 11 per cent in
speciality chemicals.
In operating profit terms, Europe showed a full year increase of 4 per cent
to Pounds 1.33bn, before restructuring charges and at current exchange
rates. Sir Michael said this was despite a distinct slowdown in sales in
southern Europe in the second half of the year. Sales in central Europe had
doubled to Pounds 300m, and were profitable.
Operating profits in North America were ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 427m,
but down 6 per cent at constant exchange rates.
Sir Michael said the launch of liquid detergents 'had not lived up to
expectations', and that marketing changes and cost reductions were being
carried out accordingly.
He denied that Unilever was at the mercy of Procter &amp; Gamble, the market
leader. 'Unilever is at the beck and call of nobody', he said. 'What we may
do is choose not to take a bloody nose in the plains, but move to the
hills.' Overall, Lever US had remained in profit for the year, he said.
In the rest of the world, sales expanded 31 per cent to Pounds 7bn and
profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 668m. Though much of this was due to
acquisition, Sir Michael said, the momentum of earnings growth from the
developing world was undiminished. In Japan, sales volume grew by 15 per
cent, and a profit was made for the first time in a number of years.
In divisional terms, much the strongest performance came from personal
products, where operating profits at current exchange rates was 33 per cent
higher at Pounds 419m. In food, profits were 8 per cent higher at Pounds
1.19bn. Detergents were up 6 per cent at Pounds 489m and speciality
chemicals up 14 per cent at Pounds 277m.
After net interest payable of Pounds 147m (Pounds 148m), pre-tax profits
after exceptionals and at current exchange rates were Pounds 1.94bn (Pounds
2.03bn). After tax of Pounds 580m (Pounds 686m) and minorities of Pounds 67m
(Pounds 52m), net profits were static at Pounds 1.3bn. Following dividend
payments of Pounds 542m (Pounds 473m), retained profits were Pounds 754m
(Pounds 818m).
Net debt rose by Pounds 300m to Pounds 1.4bn, after expenditure on
acquisitions of Pounds 590m. Gearing was 21 per cent (19.5 per cent) at the
year end.
In the fourth quarter, at constant rates of exchange, operating profits
before exceptionals were up 6 per cent to Pounds 606m on sales up 4 per cent
at Pounds 6.77bn. Net profits before exceptionals were 7 per cent up at
Pounds 394m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the Birming-ham-based industrial engineering group, has sold
its ED Hinchcliffe curtain walling subsidiary to Norcros, the building and
consumer products group, for a nominal sum.
Hinchcliffe, which lapsed into loss during the first half and checked profit
growth at Triplex, will be merged with Crittall, the UK's main curtain
walling company.
It is the sixth disposal of a building products company by Triplex. With the
exception of two companies, having a combined turnover of Pounds 11m,
Triplex has ended its involvement with the sector to concentrate on products
for the automotive and power industries.
The net effect of the disposals has been to give Triplex Pounds 6.5m in
cash.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bellwinch continues recovery with Pounds
0.27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bellwinch, the home counties house-builder, continued its recovery in the
six months to December 31, making pre-tax profits of Pounds 274,000 compared
with losses of Pounds 97,000.
The share price, in spite of the improvement, slipped 3p to 55p.
Turnover, excluding discontinued operations, rose from Pounds 5.44m to
Pounds 8.53m. Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p, compared with losses of
0.6p.
The company said it sold 89 homes in the half year, a 48 per cent rise. The
increase in sales was partly because it was also selling from more
development sites. The underlying increase in volume was between a fifth and
a quarter, the company said.
Average prices had risen from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 82,000 because of a
change in sales mix. Margins had improved as the group had begun to use up
land acquired more expensively during the late 1980s.
The company said it expected to sell nearly 200 (184) homes during the full
year. Sales were expected to rise to more than 300 during 1994-95 as the
group took advantage of its increased land buying.
The number of plots under control with planning permission had risen from
250 to more than 600. Net borrowings stand at Pounds 1.5m compared with
shareholders' funds approaching Pounds 11m. Gearing of 4.8 per cent (66.4
per cent) would have been substantially higher but for a Pounds 6.5m share
placing last summer.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Provisions cut helps Bradford &amp; Bingley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bradford &amp; Bingley building society, the UK's eighth largest, yesterday
reported a 47 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 91.3m to Pounds
134.3m for the year to end-December.
The result was helped by a steep fall in provisions for bad and doubtful
debts, from Pounds 81m to Pounds 43.7m, which the society said was a result
of lower interest rates and a slight improvement in the housing market.
However, it has also set aside about Pounds 5m against possible liabilities
as a result of its 6,000 pension transfer cases.
Total mortgage lending was down slightly, to Pounds 1.8bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Mr
John Smith, finance director, said that reflected both the strong
competition in the mortgage market, and the society's tightening of its
lending criteria and refusal to carry out uneconomic lending.
Despite the strong competition for retail savings, net retail savings
receipts were Pounds 348m - about 16 per cent of the building societies'
savings market. The percentage of wholesale funds fell from 25.6 per cent to
23.7 per cent.
Income from the society's financial planning business - it is an independent
financial adviser - rose by 20 per cent from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 30.9m.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said the results were in line
with the 'bounce-back' of the sector as a whole after the difficulties
caused by the levels of bad debts in recent years. He added that the results
were particularly impressive because the growth followed 'reasonable'
results last year as well.
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 154m (Pounds 139.6m) and operating
profits came through at Pounds 178m (Pounds 172.3m).
Assets grew by 6.3 per cent from Pounds 13bn to Pounds 13.9bn.
Coventry Building Society achieved a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 32.1m in the year to December 31.
The advance was largely because of a fall in mortgage arrears which enabled
the society to cut provisions by 60 per cent to Pounds 5.5m. The pre-tax
result was after a Pounds 1.2m exceptional charge for management
reorganisation.
The society's assets grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 2.97bn.
Pre-tax profits of the Newcastle Building Society rose by 6 per cent from
Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 13.9m in 1993, after a fall in provisions for loans
and advances to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 2.13m).
Total assets increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.19bn (Pounds 1.08bn).

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Macro 4 shows advance to Pounds 5.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macro 4, a computing services company which specialises in software for IBM
mainframe and midrange computers, maintained its 26 year record of growth
with a 9.4 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.4m.
The rise was achieved despite difficult trading conditions and lower
interest rates.
Turnover for the six months to December 31 was up 7.9 per cent at Pounds
12.1m (Pounds 11.2m).
The results were slightly below market expectations, however, and the shares
fell 38p to close at 675p, pushed by analysts' fears that second half
trading would not show an improvement and dividend growth might not be
maintained.
But Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said there had been misunderstandings, as the
company traditionally performed better in the second half.
'Despite continued difficult trading conditions, the board expects the
second year profit to exceed the first half, assuming stable trading
conditions,' he said.
Operating profits were up 15 per cent at Pounds 4.85m, but this improvement
was offset by a 23 per cent decline in interest earnings from Pounds 715,000
to Pounds 549,000. Macro 4 is a cash-rich company which traditionally
expects a substantial contribution to profits from its cash balances, which
stood at Pounds 19.3m at the year end.
Earnings per share were up 8.1 per cent at 16p (14.8p) and the interim
dividend goes up 28 per cent to 8.02p (6.27p).
Macro 4 is unusual among UK software houses in the international nature of
its business. Only 18 per cent of its revenues derive from the UK, while 33
per cent come from the US. Furthermore, it rents, rather than sells,
licences for its products, so guaranteeing recurrent income.
COMMENT
Macro 4 has proved a quietly effective performer over the years. It has high
gross profit margins and is strongly cash generating. It has shown it can
hold its own against US systems software houses like Legent Corporation and
Computer Associates. The big question is whether it can continue to grow
profitably when the market for mainframe computers is stagnating. Mr Kelly
believes large customers will increasingly use their mainframes as servers
in client server systems. The move to systems software on IBM's midrange
AS/400 computers will further help to counter any downturn in the big
systems marketplace. Analysts are marking in about Pounds 11.5m pre-tax for
the full year, leaving the shares slightly underpriced.

FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: AIB turns in IPounds 196m after
IPounds 97m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's main clearing bank, reported pre-tax profits
of IPounds 195.9m (Pounds 188m) for 1993, compared with a restated IPounds
175.8m for the nine months to the end of 1992. This was after an exceptional
charge of IPounds 96.7m representing the present value of AIB's ongoing
liabilities of IPounds 14.3m per annum, relating to the collapse of
insurance subsidiary Icarom, in 1985.
In previous years, this has been included as an annual charge, but as the
legal disputes were finally settled last year, the group has now decided to
incorporate the liability as an exceptional charge.
The main sources of profit growth were a reduction in bad debt provisions to
IPounds 134.6m (1.1 per cent of the loan book), an increase to IPounds 410m
in income from non-core activities such as mortgage lending, life assurance,
securities trading and activities in its capital markets divisions, and a
strong contribution of IPounds 115.5m from the group's US subsidiary.
Two-thirds of the pre-tax profits are now earned outside Ireland. Net
interest income on the group's core banking activities grew by 6.9 per cent
to IPounds 829.6m, which is equivalent to a 3.4 per cent increase on a
constant currency basis.
The group's UK operations returned to profit in 1993 and in Ireland core
deposits grew 19 per cent. Loan demand however fell in all markets. There
was a small improvement in net interest margins.
Reported earnings per share were 20.2p, but when adjusted for items from
continuing operations amounted to 26.8p. A final dividend of 5.65p is
recommended, for a total of 9.75p, an increase of 12.1 per cent on 1992 on
an annualised basis. Before the exceptional item, this gives a dividend
cover of 2.7.
COMMENT
The substantial drop in interest rates and an improving economic outlook in
all of AIB's markets provides a sound basis for continuing improvement in
1994. The group has finally turned around its loss-making UK division, and
the strong performance of the US subsidiary points to future expansion
overseas. Having finally cleared up the financial consequences of its
disastrous foray into the insurance market in the 1980s, and taken an
exceptional charge now to cover future liabilities, the group's accounts can
now show a clearer picture of underlying performance. Market analysts are
forecasting pre-tax profits for 1994 of about IPounds 340m, earnings of
29.6p and dividend growth of 10 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Manders shopping centre sold for Pounds 82m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manders, the paints, inks and property group which on December 19 sold its
decorative paints division for Pounds 55m, announced yesterday the sale to
Prudential of the Mander Centre, its Wolverhampton shopping centre and sole
investment property interest, for about Pounds 82m.
Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, explained that the sale, following
the paints disposal, 'strategically realigns the group as a speciality
chemicals company with the emphasis on printing inks'.
On December 16, Manders augmented its inks division with the Pounds 26.7m
acquisition of the printing inks and graphic supplies business of Croda
International.
Mr John Farmer, finance director, said: 'We were a stool with three legs and
we've chopped off two.' However, he added that there was sufficient spread
within the inks business - not least geographically since the Croda
acquisition - for one leg to be steady enough for the group.
Asked about how the cash consideration would be used, Mr Farmer said that UK
acquisitions would be 'small and useful', but that the serious money would
go to expand the international side of the inks business.
Mr Farmer reckoned that the consideration - payable on June 24  - had 'set a
new level in terms of yield for shopping centres'.
It had been given an open market valuation of Pounds 65m at the end of
December 1989; by the end of 1991, that figure had fallen to Pounds 57.5m.
A potential tax liability of up to Pounds 10m - payable in September 1995 -
will result, said Mr Farmer, though this was a 'worst-case scenario'.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Exchange gains lift Sedgwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange gains offset a fall in investment income and allowed
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, to increase 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds
70.5m, compared with Pounds 56.7m previously.
Earnings per share grew from 7.8p to 9p, while a final dividend of 3p per
share made an unchanged total for the year of 6p.
Brokerage and fee income increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 762m (Pounds
631.9m). Excluding acquisitions and exchange rate gains, the underlying
growth rate was 3 per cent.
Expenses increased to Pounds 722.5m (Pounds 610.3m), an underlying increase
of 2 per cent. Interest and investment income fell from Pounds 53m to Pounds
47.7m.
Share of associates' losses fell to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3.1m), while the
insurance underwriting result amounted to a loss of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds
900,000 profit), with losses at the River Thames, a London market company,
increasing to Pounds 6.9m. Interest payable fell to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds
15.7m).
Foreign exchange gains resulting from both the strength of the US dollar
over the year and successful hedging amounted to Pounds 16.2m.
A generally improving economy helped US retail income grow by 6 per cent.
However, despite increases in premium rates in the reinsurance market,
income at Sedgwick Payne, the group's reinsurance arm, fell by 2 per cent.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, suggested a shortage of capacity in the
energy market and the decision by many buyers in the marine market to buy
less cover was responsible.
Losses at Sedgwick's Lloyd's agency subsidiary increased to Pounds 1.4m
(Pounds 1.3m). Mr Riley said that Sedgwick was concerned about the failure
of the Lloyd's settlement offer last week, but was 'confident that the
strength of our members' agency will carry it through this difficult
period.'
'We are prudently reserved and have quite a small problem compared with the
rest of the market,' he added.
COMMENT
Cynics will suggest that the markets were unduly impressed yesterday by
profits that had more to do with foreign exchange gains than any significant
underlying growth in business. Indeed measured against some of its smaller
and faster growing rivals, Sedgwick - on an historic p/e of 21 on
yesterday's closing price - looks fully valued. However, there is a positive
side to the story. Expenses are under control and following the acquisition
of Noble Lowndes last year the quality of group earnings has improved, with
nearly a third of income coming likely to come from fees this year. Also,
Sedgwick - with more than 35 per cent of its income stemming from US retail
business - is well placed to benefit from US economic recovery, the strength
of the dollar, the long forecast 'turn' in the US insurance market and
possible rises in US interest rates.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Guardian Royal jumps to Pounds 751m -
Investment gains, underwriting and lower UK claims boost insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increases in insurance rates, a reduction in claims in the UK, and
investment gains, helped lift Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the
five composite insurance companies, to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 751m for
1993 against Pounds 150m last time.
Excluding investment gains, the pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 183m
against Pounds 3m in 1992.
Earnings per share leapt from 13.2p to 74.5p. A 4.95p recommended final
makes a full year payout of 7.6p, an 8.6 per cent increase.
However, hints from the company that rates in some sectors of the UK market
could soon begin to fall were badly received by investors, who marked the
shares down 16p to close at 218p.
Other insurance companies - which report their 1993 results over the next
month - were also caught in the fall-out.
'The increase in worldwide premiums written from Pounds 2.24bn to Pounds
2.61bn indicates the success achieved in retaining a large quantity of
business while increasing premium rates substantially,' said Mr Sid Hopkins,
chief executive.
GRE's three main overseas markets - Ireland, Germany, and the US  - all
produced better results, but the improvement centred on the UK, from where
GRE derives 43 per cent of its non-life premium income.
Underwriting profits were achieved on a number of lines - including motor,
home insurance and commercial property, and underwriting losses fell to
Pounds 29m (Pounds 170m).
Mr John Sinclair, head of UK operations, said: 'The improvement demonstrates
the consistency of our approach in assesing risks, charging adequate
premiums and scrutinising all claims carefully.' GRE would 'maintain its
stance' even though 'regrettably there are signs of the market softening.'
Mr Hopkins later reiterated GRE's determination not to 'follow the market
down', stressing that the company had considerable scope to maintain or
increase its premium income without reducing rates.
A new direct insurance company - selling both motor and home insurance  -
will begin operations later this year. GRE could also make further
reductions in the amount of personal lines business it cedes to reinsurers
by way of a quota share reinsurance treaty.
Shareholders' funds at the end of 1993 amounted to 193p per share, a 47 per
cent increase over the year. The solvency ratio - which measures
shareholders' funds as a percentage of non-life premium income - amounted to
64 per cent (51 per cent).

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI advances to Pounds 251m at nine
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Thorn EMI rose from Pounds 245m to Pounds 251.1m in the
nine months to December 31.
Turnover of Pounds 3.31bn compared with Pounds 3.29bn.
The group was reporting quarterly profits for the first time.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said that although Christmas sales had been
encouraging, they were now flat. He said: 'It's not doom and gloom, but it's
not sunshine and light either.'
Operating profits of continuing operations rose from Pounds 236.9m to Pounds
291.4m. After tax of Pounds 95.8m (Pounds 78.1m) and minorities,
attributable profits were Pounds 5m lower at Pounds 151m.
Music profits rose 39 per cent to Pounds 212m while rental profits were up
12.6 per cent to Pounds 90.4m. The HMV music chain saw profits advance to
Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 1.9m). Security and electronics lost Pounds 17.5m,
compared with a Pounds 2.2m profit.
At period end net borrowings had been reduced to Pounds 534.8m (Pounds
761.5m) mainly resulting from disposals.
Mr Warren Rudman, the former US Senator, said yesterday that Thorn EMI's
American rental business provided many consumers with access to goods they
would not otherwise have had.
Mr Rudman was speaking after the conclusion of his investigation into
alleged malpractice at Thorn's Rent-A-Center subsidiary.
He said it was untrue that Rent-A-Center relied exclusively on poor
customers who were open to exploitation. The investigation, he said, had
found that 19 per cent of Rent-A-Center customers had annual household
incomes of more than Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 27,000). A further 39 per cent
had incomes of between Dollars 20,000 and Dollars 40,000.
Mr Rudman said he had relied on three sources in preparing his 250-page
report, which will be published in a few weeks' time.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals 29% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Chemicals, the dyes and speciality chemicals company, pushed
pre-tax profits up by 29 per cent from Pounds 10.1m to a record Pounds 13m
in 1993.
However, the shares ended 11p lower at 459p yesterday after Mr Phillip Lowe,
the chairman, warned that market conditions were unlikely to improve in
1994. But he predicted that the company 'will continue to make progress'.
'Last year was tougher than we anticipated and I do not expect to see any
general improvement until towards the end of 1994.' In particular, Mr Lowe
is sceptical about the improvement in the UK economy.
He added, however, that the company's important markets in America and
Australia were 'set fair' and it was currently 'very busy across the field'.
Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 112m despite an average reduction in
prices of an estimated 4 per cent. About 90 per cent of the company's sales
are overseas and Mr Lowe said that of last year's Pounds 3m profits increase
about Pounds 1m was due to exchange rate movements. A further Pounds 1m was
the interest benefit from last February's Pounds 24.3m rights issue.
The best performance came from Australia where operating profits rose by
more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m on sales up a third to Pounds 22m.
Capital spending rose from Pounds 10m to Pounds 13.6m in 1993 and is
expected to remain at that level in the current year.
Earnings per share on the enlarged equity rose by 18 per cent to 21.1p.
The dividend is lifted 6 per cent to 8.1p (7.65p).
COMMENT
There will be precious few chemical companies reporting record figures for
1993 so the market's response to Yorkshire's results looked slightly
grudging. True, the chairman was gloomy about the market outlook. But then
Yorkshire has never let economic problems get it down. Over the last few
years it has generated very strong growth in Australia while the economy has
been flat on its back. That growth came mainly from expansion into new
pigment markets, a process which has a long way to go in other countries,
while Yorkshire has still barely scratched the surface of the huge US
market. With current exchange rates still helpful profits should reach
Pounds 15.3m this year for earnings growth of about 12 per cent. But after a
good run the shares are now on 19 times prospective earnings and are due a
pause for breath.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Tomato war ends as market is sliced up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The transatlantic tomato war is over. Zeneca, the UK biosciences company,
and its US foes, Calgene and Campbell Soup, have negotiated a comprehensive
settlement of their long-standing dispute over patents for genetically
engineered non-squashy tomatoes.
The three companies have agreed how to slice up the market for so-called PG
tomatoes, which last longer than the natural fruit without rotting. These
are expected to take a substantial segment of the Dollars 11bn (Pounds
7.5bn) a year world market for tomatoes, because they can be picked ripe and
still reach the supermarket or processing plant in good condition.
Calgene, a Californian biotechnology company, will have exclusive worldwide
rights to fresh PG tomatoes. It is ready to sell these in the US under the
Flavr Savr trademark.
Zeneca and Campbell will share world rights to use PG tomatoes for processed
foods such as paste, soups and ketchup. These are likely to reach the US
market late in 1995, according to Zeneca.
Mr Simon Best, manager of Zeneca's fruit and vegetables business, said the
UK company was happy to give up the fresh PG market 'because we are
developing alternative technologies to achieve a tomato that will keep for
longer with a better flavour.'
The dispute arose because Zeneca and Calgene (with funding from Campbell)
independently developed the same genetic method for blocking the PG enzyme
which makes tomatoes soften as they ripen.
Zeneca's attempt to squash the Calgene patent made Mr Roger Salquist,
Calgene chief executive, see red. 'I didn't spend Dollars 95m in research in
order to give it away to some bozos from Great Britain,' he was quoted as
saying in 1992.
Now the companies are regrouping to fight a common enemy - the anti-biotech
activists who see the PG tomato as a target in their battle against
genetically engineered food.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cap &amp; Regional seeks Pounds 25m for
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital and Regional Properties, the USM-quoted property investment company,
yesterday announced a rights issue to fund the bulk of a Pounds 33.4m
property acquisition from Throgmorton Trust.
The acquisition was accompanied by the announcement of pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 422,000) for the year to December 25.
The company is buying R Green Properties, which comprises six large mainly
commercial properties in the south of England.
Mr Martin Barber, chairman, said the acquisition 'will bring a substantial
portfolio of properties which provide a range of opportunities to be
exploited'.
The portfolio has a current rental yield of Pounds 2.9m, or 8.7 per cent,
but there is a high vacancy rate in several buildings.
The acquisition is being partly funded by a 1-for-2 rights issue at 173p,
compared with yesterday's closing price of 210p, up 6p. It will raise a net
Pounds 25.3m. The balance will be covered by a new Pounds 10m bank facility.
Capital and Regional's gearing will fall from 72 per cent to 59 per cent,
following the rights issue and acquisition. Mr Barber said he would be happy
to see gearing rise to 100 per cent, given his current confidence in the UK
property market.
During 1993, the company's net assets per share rose from 157.8p to 163.8pm,
as a result of a 16 per cent increase in the value of its UK property
portfolio, and property purchases funded by new equity.
The company also succeeded in floating its joint venture US property
interests on the American Stock Exchange, as CenterPoint. It retains a 22.6
per cent stake.
Net rental and fee income rose 24 per cent to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 6.03m),
reflecting the enlarged portfolio. Earnings per share rose sixfold to 3.04p
(0.41p), and the company is recommending a final dividend of 1p, making a
full year payout of 1.5p (1.1p).

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: GKN and Westland strategy talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairmen of GKN and Westland met yesterday for the first time since GKN
launched its hostile Pounds 497m bid for the helicopter maker a fortnight
ago.
Sir David Lees asked to meet Mr Alan Jones, his Westland counterpart, to
reiterate GKN's strategic reasons for making the bid.
Although Mr Jones has urged Westland shareholders to reject GKN's offer, Sir
David said they had an amicable discussion during which he reiterated his
determination to preserve the Yeovil-based company's management structure
and continue with its existing defence projects.
'I told Alan that I was concerned that the process might appear to be
hostile. We have no wish for it to be interpreted that way,' he said.
There were no signs last night, however, that Mr Jones had altered his
opposition to GKN, which announced its bid earlier this month after
acquiring an 18.7 per cent stake in Westland from United Technologies, the
US parent of Sikorsky helicopters.
The acquisition took GKN's holding to 45 per cent and forced it to mount a
full bid. Sir David also met a number of MPs whose constituencies border the
Westland plant to give reassurances on job cuts and the affects of a
takeover.

FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson to raise Dollars 1bn via convertible
bond offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, intends to raise Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) through one of the largest-ever international convertible bond
offerings.
The company said the proceeds of the offering, which will be issued by its
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Hanson America, would be used to retire
existing bank debt.
Bankers involved in arranging the widely-expected offering said the funds
raised would partly refinance the expensive debt which Hanson inherited when
it bought Quantum Chemical Corporation last year.
They added that the structure of the deal, which is being arranged by Lehman
Brothers, provided Hanson with a tax-efficient way to finance its US
operations.
Last week, Hanson announced plans to complete the refinancing of Quantum's
Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.6bn) worth of junk bond debt. The company is to
redeem three bond issues on March 15 with a total of Dollars 900m
outstanding, which were paying an average interest rate of 11.4 per cent. It
redeemed Dollars 1.15bn of bonds at the end of October last year and bought
Dollars 300m of bonds in the market. Altogether this debt bore an average
rate of 11 per cent.
The new bonds, which are exchangeable into Hanson's American depositary
shares, are likely to have a current yield of about three per cent. But
since the bonds will be issued at a relatively deep discount to par, their
yield to maturity is likely to be between 5 1/4 and 5 3/4 per cent.
The bonds are expected to have a maturity of seven years and carry a
conversion premium of between 20 to 22 per cent. Yesterday Hanson's ADSs
traded at Dollars 20 3/8 , down  5/8 on the day.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Shake-up costs limit Unilever profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group, has launched a
restructuring programme costing Pounds 490m worldwide over the next three
years. The programme will lead to 7,500 job losses, of which up to 1,000
could come in the UK.
The annual savings would amount to about Pounds 240m, Unilever said.
However, the charge pulled down full-year profits to Pounds 1.94bn before
tax, a fall of 4 per cent. In underlying terms, profits were up 11 per cent,
half the rise being due to the weakness of sterling.
The cost-cutting is further evidence of the pressures felt by branded goods
manufacturers in the developed world. Last July Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's
dominant competitor in the US, took a charge of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1.02bn) to cover 13,000 job losses and the closure of 30 factories.
Unilever chairman Sir Michael Perry said two-thirds of the restructuring
charge would be a cash cost, the rest being the write-off of plant. Over the
past five years, he said, Unilever had spent some Pounds 600m on
restructuring. The same underlying rate of spending was likely to continue.
But the strength of the business allowed an acceleration of the programme at
present.
Unilever's last big restructuring exercise was launched three years ago in
preparation for the European single market, at a cost of Pounds 305m. The
programme, now three-quarters complete, was producing annual savings of some
Pounds 150m, the company said.
This time the blow will be heavier in the US, where Unilever has been badly
buffeted in detergents wars with Procter &amp; Gamble. Of the total cost, 37 per
cent will be incurred in north America and 57 per cent in Europe, still
Unilever's biggest field of operations.
Sir Michael played down suggestions that branded goods were coming under
pressure from low-cost competition in the US and Europe. Most comment on the
subject had been over the top, he said. While Unilever had been forced in
the UK to cut the price of its tea brands, this was an isolated example.
The latest job losses amount to 2.5 per cent of the 300,000 workforce.
However, Sir Michael said, this did not imply that the workforce was
falling, since Unilever was also expanding in other markets.
Despite the fall in earnings, the full year dividend was raised 17 per cent
to 25.03p. The shares fell 38p to 1162p.

Net charges:                    Pounds 490m after Pounds 518m costs and
                                           Pounds 28m disposal proceeds
Job losses:                            7,500 jobs out of Pounds 300,000
Operations affected:                        60 projects in 20 countries
Annual savings:                          Pounds 240m within three years
Worst hit:                                         detergents in the US

                                 and made it imperative to operate with

FT  23 FEB 94 / Metallgesellschaft plans DM1bn disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based metals, mining and
industrial group, is planning to raise at least DM1bn (Pounds 390m) from
disposals this year, according to its chief executive.
At his first press conference since taking over before Christmas, Mr Kajo
Neukirchen said yesterday that proceeds from disposals, alongside other
cuts, would help halve the group's DM9.4bn debts by September.
He indicated that losses from speculative oil derivatives trading in the US
amounted to nearly DM1.5bn in the three months to December. This was in line
with the figure given to bankers last month when a DM3.4bn rescue package
was agreed. This brings the total amount lost in speculative oil futures
trading, conducted through the New York-based MG Corp, to DM2.3bn.
The explosion of activity in oil futures trading during 1993 was still not
fully explained, Mr Neukirchen said. The volume of oil MG Corp contracted to
deliver rose from 20m barrels to 160m barrels between October 1992 and the
end of last year. The final position was equivalent to 80 days' oil
production by Kuwait. Details of an investigation would emerge at a
shareholders' meeting on March 30.
Mr Neukirchen expressed cautious optimism about the group's future but said
a strategy had yet to be finalised. Job cuts were to be limited to 7,500 of
the group's 43,292 employees, which would save DM550m a year. He intended to
cut the cost of materials and other items by DM1bn this year.
Included on the list of 'for sale' candidates are the mining activities,
grouped together in the 50.1 per cent owned Metall Mining Corporation, a
Canadian company. Mr Neukirchen said the mining activities required too much
capital.
This was the first time that Metallgesellschaft had confirmed that the
mining businesses were to be sold alongside the 46.7 per cent stake in
Kolbenschmidt, a supplier to the car industry, and three smaller holdings.
But the disposal of mining is not surprising as Metallgesellschaft has
pointedly omitted to mention it as a core business.
Mr Neukirchen praised the big German banks for mounting the rescue operation
which ensured the group's survival last month, but declined to pass comment
on the role of the supervisory board in failing to prevent the crisis at MG
Corp. He indicated that Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who
is supervisory board chairman, would address the issue at tomorrow's special
annual general meeting.
Excluding MG Corp, there was a pre-tax profit of DM35.3m in the three months
to December, on turnover of DM4.3bn.

FT  23 FEB 94 / SmithKline confident of Tagamet's successors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of new products from SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare
company, will be strong enough to counter 'a dramatic fall' in sales of
Tagamet, once its best-selling drug, according to Mr Jan Leschly, incoming
chief executive.
Tagamet loses US patent protection in May and at least 10 generic versions
of the drug would then be launched, Mr Leschly said yesterday.
Concern over the impact of Tagamet's patent expiry has been one reason for
the company's near 5 per cent fall in share price over the past year.
But Mr Leschly was 'quite confident' that sales of four new drugs '
antidepressant Seroxat (Paxil in the US), arthritis treatment Relifex
(Relafen), cancer drug Kytril and hepatitis A vaccine Havrix ' 'will be able
to offset the declining sales of Tagamet'. Sales of the four new drugs more
than doubled from Pounds 212m in 1992 to Pounds 463m last year.
Pre-tax profits for 1993 rose 12 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn, at the top end
of analysts' forecasts. Turnover increased 18 per cent to Pounds 6.16bn,
thanks to a strong final quarter. But price pressures in several large
pharmaceuticals markets meant that the trading profit margin fell 1.5
percentage points to 19.1 per cent.
A fourth quarter dividend of 3.3p per A share makes a total of 10.9p, up 24
per cent. Earnings climbed 5 per cent to 29.1p.
Mr Bob Bauman, who leaves to chair British Aerospace in April, said that the
dividend cover had now reached the company's target level.
SmithKline Beecham eliminated year-end debt for the first time since the
1989 merger of SmithKline Beckman of the US with Beecham of the UK. Net cash
amounted to Pounds 38m, compared with Pounds 392m debt.
In the divisions, pharmaceuticals sales rose 21 per cent to Pounds 3.48bn.
When currency factors are taken out, the growth was 9 per cent. The rise was
driven by sales and not prices, said Mr Bauman.
Tagamet sales fell 6 per cent to Pounds 673m, with currency gains stripped
out. After more than 15 years as SmithKline Beckman's and then SmithKline
Beecham's best selling product, it is now second to Augmentin, the
antibiotic whose sales rose 17 per cent to Pounds 760m.
To improve drugs sales further, Mr Leschly said the group was prepared to
enter into alliances both in the US and Europe.
Other divisions saw steady progress. Sales at Consumer Healthcare, which
includes brands such as the soft drink Ribena and toothpaste Aquafresh, rose
12 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Wall of liquidity drains into a statistical maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in the supply of money quickly drives up asset prices and
eventually fuels economic expansion. This is a basic cyclical theory and
explains why the stock market tends to be a lead indicator of the underlying
economy. But real life is rarely that simple.
Even the Bundesbank is wavering in its interpretation of monetary growth.
The annual German M3 growth rate of 8.1 per cent, it says, has been
temporarily boosted by factors such as the tax-based repatriation of funds
from Luxembourg. So D-Mark interest rates are coming down even though
monetary growth is well above the 6.5 per cent ceiling of the target range.
But excessive monetary growth is at present almost uniquely a German
problem. Around the world the monetary aggregates are not at all buoyant.
Broad money growth for the G10 countries, for instance, was running at about
3 per cent last year. There is a clash here with all those loosely-worded
stories about the 'wall of liquidity' which has been driving up bond and
equity markets. Why doesn't it show up in the statistics?
One obvious problem is that the monetarists juggle with a whole row of Ms,
some narrowly defined so that they reflect only the level of everyday
transactions in the shops, others wide enough to include assets which can
count in some circumstances as long-term savings.
In the mid-1980s the British government struggled to restrain double-digit
growth in broad money but discovered that raising interest rates only served
to fuel the problem. Moderately high interest rates tend to encourage the
growth of the banking system. In the end the British Treasury got bored and
frustrated and decided to focus on other monetary targets instead, like the
exchange rate, with equal lack of success.
More recently the US Federal Reserve embarked on a radical policy of very
low interest rates, from which it has only just begun to retreat (with a
further interest rate warning from the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan
yesterday). Far from boosting monetary growth, the 3 per cent interest
caused a deceleration of the broader aggregates as investors fled deposits.
Low interest rates can cause the banking system to shrink, as activity
shifts to the securities markets. However, the narrowest definitions of
money have been growing quite fast, sometimes at more than 10 per cent
year-on-year - although growth has slowed recently.
One of Britain's leading monetarists, Tim Congdon, continues to believe that
steady growth of broad money - defined as 'assets that can be used to make
payments' - is essential to economic stability. In his latest Gerrard &amp;
National Monthly Economic Review he says this can be done if sales of
government debt are actively juggled to supplement the impact of short-term
interest rate changes. Last year, for instance, the British government
should have underfunded its deficit in order to increase the growth rate of
broad money. Yet he is pleased by the very recent acceleration of M4 and
thinks that the impact of easier money will overwhelm the negative effect of
imminent tax increases.
Internationally, however, such an analysis does not seem very helpful. The
US economy is growing quite strongly even though broad money has contracted
in real terms over several years, while the German economy is in deep
recession even though M3 is overshooting there.
The trouble is, money can move across borders and change its form; central
bankers may set a money target, but the public can have a different idea of
the money it wants to hold.
If the Federal Reserve pumps liquidity into the money market and holds
interest rates down to 3 per cent, the impact may not be primarily seen in
the US. It may cause disappointment amongst international dollar bulls. It
may be felt in faraway countries where locals are eagerly selling assets to
bargain-hunting US mutual funds. Last year the stock market rose by 7 per
cent in the US but by 121 per cent in Hong Kong. Incidentally, inflation is
just under 3 per cent in the US but 24 per cent in China.
Of course, if these alternative assets, whether US Treasury bonds or
emerging market equities, suddenly look dangerous, ordinary money might not
seem so unattractive after all.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Thorn US cleared of improper practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI was largely cleared yesterday of improper practices at its
American rental subsidiary in an investigation carried out by former US
Senator Warren Rudman.
Mr Rudman said that although some of the allegations in a Wall Street
Journal article last September were true, they were unrepresentative. The
vast majority of customers of the Rent-A-Center subsidiary were satisfied
with their treatment.
'We are sure that some misconduct occurs, but it is pretty isolated, it's
not pervasive and it's not company policy,' Mr Rudman said. He had made some
recommendations to the company on improving its training.
Mr Rudman said it was true, as alleged in the article, that a Rent-A-Center
franchisee entered a customer's home with former Hell's Angels. The same
franchisee, who had now left the company, had put superglue on customers'
locks.
An allegation that a late-paying customer had been forced into a van and
made to carry heavy goods was incorrect. The customer was a friend of the
employee and had helped him voluntarily, although this was against company
rules.
Mr Rudman said he had found no evidence of employees demanding sexual
favours from customers, as alleged.
He found 91 per cent of customers said they were treated with respect. Of
those whose payments were late, 91 per cent said the company tried to help
them find a solution.
Mr Rudman said he had recommended the company improve its procedures in
three ways, although he stressed that abuses were not widespread.
It should strengthen its rules preventing employees from entering customers'
homes where no adult was present.
Employees needed better training on liability damage waiver agreements.
These allow customers to stop payment if goods are stolen or damaged but,
unlike insurance, do not provide for their replacement. He said a small
number of employees were selling waiver agreements as insurance.
Some customers thought they were receiving new goods when they were getting
used products. The company needed to provide clearer explanations, he said.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Greenspan moves to allay fears over US inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jitters in financial markets about higher US inflation were overdone, Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated yesterday.
He said further increases in US short-term interest rates were likely this
year as the Fed returned US monetary policy to a more 'neutral' stance, but
the tone of his remarks to Congress suggested another move was unlikely in
the immediate future.
Mr Greenspan said recent increases in the prices of some commodities and
manufactured goods probably reflected the strength of industrial orders and
production and should not be seen as evidence that inflation was
accelerating.
His comments about inflation were intended to reassure bond market
investors, who have become apprehensive about inflation prospects following
the Fed's decision on February 4 to raise short-term interest rates by a
quarter of a point to 3 1/4 per cent. Long bond yields have risen sharply to
well over 6.5 per cent on the assumption that the Fed would not have acted
as it did if inflation were not a threat.
Yesterday, Wall Street was mildly encouraged by his remarks. Long bonds
showed moderate gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.20
higher at 3,911.66. Delivering his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary
report to Congress, Mr Greenspan sought to place the Fed's February 4
decision in a longer-term perspective.
The Fed was gradually tightening monetary policy not because inflation posed
an immediate threat but to prevent it getting out of control in 1995 and
1996, he said. The abnormally low interest rates of recent years were no
longer justified because debt burdens were sharply reduced and the economy
growing vigorously.
'To promote sustainable growth, history suggests that real short-term rates
are more likely to have to rise than fall from here.' Mr Greenspan added
that he hoped any increase in real short-term rates could be achieved in
part through a further decline in inflation expectations.
He said the Fed was no longer putting much faith in monetary aggregates as a
guide to policy. He surprised some members of Congress by arguing that the
gold price was a reliable guide to future inflation prospects, along with
exchange rates and the interest rate yield curve.
He forecast economic growth of 3 per cent or slightly more this year.
Inflation would be about 3 per cent this year, fractionally higher than last
year. The long-term economic outlook remained the best in decades.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Japanese TV faces shake-up: Readiness to scrap high
definition system angers electronics industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry shocked the consumer
electronics industry yesterday by making clear it was prepared to dump the
country's high definition television system, developed over 30 years, in
favour of more sophisticated digital technology.
The shift makes the establishment of a worldwide digital standard for HDTV
increasingly likely. The US is poised to finalise its own digital HDTV
standards and is about to begin field tests of the new technology.
NHK, the Japanese public broadcasting network, is already broadcasting eight
hours of programmes a day in the analogue HDTV format. The Japanese
electronics industry has poured huge amounts into developing equipment based
on the analogue system. More than 20,000 wide-screen sets have been sold to
wholesalers and the public.
Mr Akimasa Egawa, director-general of the ministry's broadcasting
administration bureau, said yesterday that Japan should consider many
possibilities in the context of a global trend towards digital systems.
The ministry would make a final decision in July.
Japanese broadcast and consumer electronics industry representatives
described the move as 'very regrettable' and demanded a retraction.
Representatives of the European and US industries welcomed the move.
The US, Japan and the European Union plan to adopt the high definition TV
system by the late 1990s.
The statement from the ministry stunned NHK which developed Japan's high
definition TV system, known as Hi-Vision. It said Mr Egawa's remarks 'hinder
the progress of Hi-Vision promotion, spoil the efforts hitherto made by the
concerned parties, run counter to audience expectation and are thus very
regrettable'.
The Electronics Industry Association of Japan, representing equipment
makers, pointed out that digital TV was still far away from realisation and
therefore Mr Egawa's remarks would cause undue confusion in the market.
NHK began developing its own HDTV 30 years ago and tried to make it a world
standard by encouraging the US and Europe to adopt its system. However,
fears that adopting NHK's system would give Japanese consumer electronics
makers a significant head start led the EU, under pressure from European
consumer electronics makers, to develop its own analogue HDTV system.
The US decided to adopt a digital system developed by a US consortium, and
has pressed hard recently to establish digital as the world standard for
HDTV. Last year the EU decided to ditch its development attempts, and could
now move towards adopting a digital system.

<TEXT>
Careless talk costs money, as Guardian Royal Exchange found yesterday when
it suggested that the UK insurance market showed signs of softening. The
resulting 7 per cent fall in the shares was probably more than was warranted
in the short run. But it is testimony to the way investors fear competition
will develop now that balance sheets have been repaired and capacity
increased. This time the insurance cycle could be tougher than usual. Direct
Line telephone insurance has put additional pressure on pricing. With
sluggish economic recovery, consumer demand for insurance is also likely to
remain subdued.
GRE, of course, simply intended to signal it was aware of the dangers and
would proceed with caution. But insurance companies always say that sort of
thing. The real test will be how they behave as the competition actually
develops. GRE has one disadvantage in that it has come late to telephone
selling. To justify the costs, it will need additional volume in what looks
like a buyer's market. Then there is its weakness in life insurance, where
operating profits of only Pounds 23m compare with Pounds 359m in other
categories. Pressure on this side is bound to intensify as the Nationwide
tie expires.
At least GRE has rebuilt net assets without recourse to shareholders. That
still leaves the question of how the capital will be deployed to earn a
decent return. Unless it can find an answer GRE might have done better to
follow recent banking examples and increase its dividend by more than 8.6
per cent. Perhaps it wants a bulwark against difficult times ahead. It needs
more than that to justify a yield which, at 4.4 per cent, remains
substantially below most of its peers.
3i
3i is in danger of becoming something of a tease. Talk of its imminent
flotation seems to come around with the spring tides or the periodic low
water marks of its owners' liquidity. Presumably advisers are happy to
continue collecting fees for doing the same work time and again, but the
banks' age-long indecisiveness risks undermining 3i's credibility and boring
the market.
Assuming that this is not a drill, one can understand the banks' desire to
move now. Investment trust discounts to net assets are at their lowest for
more than a generation. 3i would have a good shanty to sing about prospects
for its wide spread of unquoted company investments. With recession and the
working capital squeeze passing, small businesses may well be an attractive
play. Certainly more so than two years ago when the clearers wanted to sell
3i as practically their only asset not damaged by flood.
In the past year the FT-SE SmallCap index has handsomely outperformed the
rest of the market. The risk, however, is that the pedestrian banks will
miss the top of the cycle. Sagging bonds are already hinting at the
mortality of the current bull run. And at these kinds of discount,
investment trusts hardly count as cheap assets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after SmithKline and Beecham were fused, Mr Bob Bauman can bow
out having delivered the earnings growth which shareholders demanded. From
the outside at least, the integration of the two companies also seems to
have gone reasonably smoothly. Yet there are still reasons to wonder whether
the merger was strictly necessary. Some of the strengths of the combined
company - size and a complementary mix of products - are now a drag on sales
and earnings growth. Pharmaceuticals remains the most important source of
profits. Yet Tagamet, which has always been a source of worry, came from
SmithKline, while many of the newer compounds which will replace it
originated within Beecham. Its shareholders might have fared better if it
had disposed of its personal care business and soldiered on as a drugs
company.
The Tagamet pain is about to strike in earnest, with the expiry of its US
patent in May. Quite how fast Tagamet will lose ground to the generic
competition is unclear, though there have been some drastic declines
elsewhere in recent years. More general uncertainty over US healthcare
reform also remains a depressant. And while the dividend has risen by a 24
per cent, that looks like a one-off rebasing, rather than the kind of cash
avalanche which is about to hit Glaxo shareholders. The single-figure
earnings growth expected in 1994 will probably come entirely from currency
gains. With an encouraging range of new products, there is life after
Tagamet, but shareholders are not enjoying it yet.

<TEXT>
It is not hard to see why the market was rattled by Unilever's full-year
figures yesterday. Of the whopping Pounds 490m restructuring charge, Pounds
280m relates to Europe, just three years after the company wrote off Pounds
305m in preparation for the single market. In underlying terms,
restructuring costs worldwide are running at around Pounds 120m a year into
the dateless future. Meanwhile, advertising expenditure last year rose by 20
per cent, the reward being sales up 7 per cent and volume up 1.5 per cent,
or almost zero in the final quarter. Plainly, Unilever's world is slowing
down.
But neither is it hard to construct a case for the defence. Unilever is a
formidable cash machine, whose relentless investment in brands and
production efficiency in the depths of recession cannot be matched by its
regional competitors. It thus represents a store of value waiting to be
unlocked by economic recovery. It also has enviable exposure to the
developing world, where sales and profits grew last year by almost a
quarter, even at constant exchange rates. And if it has fouled up in US
detergents lately, that is a matter of swings and roundabouts. Indeed, the
fact that it is breaking even on several billions of dollars of sales could
be seen as an opportunity.
The question is how long it will take for all this value to be realised, and
how sharp the earnings recovery will be when it comes. In the meantime,
however humble the earnings multiple, the yield is a meagre 2.7 per cent.
The 17 per cent increase in the PLC dividend is deceptive, since it is
driven by an NV dividend up only in line with Dutch inflation of 1.7 per
cent. The stock is plainly out of fashion, and may stay that way for a
while.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Council tendering target reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced a scaling down of its ambitious plans for
exposing local authority services to private sector competition.
English metropolitan councils will be required to put out to competitive
tender 65 per cent of their white-collar construction services, rather than
the 90 per cent ministers proposed in 1992.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities claimed the
reduction in competitive tendering for construction was the result of
'pressure from local authorities', and said it would attempt to reduce the
figure still further during consultation, which lasts until May.
Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, said the proposals, announced in a
consultation paper, were the result of 'frank, positive and useful
discussions between central and local government'.
The construction services are architecture, engineering, surveying and
valuation, which account for a total budget of more than Pounds 1m. They
will be the first white-collar services compulsorily exposed to competition
under the government's competitive tendering programme. The 90 per cent
target was to have applied for all white-collar services.
A series of separate exemptions for small councils and for those that have
recently started large projects means that many authorities will be required
to market-test much less than 65 per cent of their services when competitive
tendering becomes compulsory in October next year.
Authorities will also be free not to take the cheapest bid; they can make
their own judgments about the trade-off between quality and cost, provided
the procedures are 'fair and even-handed'.
However, local authorities in England and Wales will have to publish
accounts to enable the costs of their services to be compared with others.
Mr Baldry said he assumed comparisons would 'identify the best and stimulate
the rest'.
Officials made clear that they would not publish the data in the form of
'league tables'. It will appear as a memorandum to council accounts, and
will be subject to audit.
The new statements of support service and costs will be introduced next year
for legal and construction-related services and will later be extended to
cover information technology, finance, personnel and administration.
They must show the total cost of each service to the council  - whether it
has been provided by private contractors or in-house  - and how much has
been charged to other council departments for use of services.
Councils reacted negatively, with Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of
Labour-controlled Newcastle city council, saying the new statements would be
'bureaucratic, time-consuming and expensive to prepare'.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Enter more dragons: John Burton assesses South Korean
President Kim's achievements in his first year and the challenges ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kim Young-sam's first year as South Korean president has been a good one,
dispelling the low expectations held by officials and business leaders when
he was elected.
His most notable and durable achievement so far has been in purging the
remnants of the military elite that ruled the country from 1961 until early
last year, while curbing the powers of the once-feared intelligence agency.
University professors have replaced ex-army officers in senior government
posts.
The political house-cleaning, begun shortly after the former political
dissident was inaugurated as president on February 25 last year, has made
his government the most democratic in Korean history. South Korea now has
one of the most politically free societies in Asia, on a par with Japan in
terms of fair elections, an unfettered press and civil liberties.
Mr Kim has also attacked the corruption in the political system by banning
corporate funding of politicians' election campaigns. Bribery of bureaucrats
has been made more difficult by last summer's abolition of anonymous bank
accounts, which tended to conceal illicit funds. More than 1,500 officials
have been sacked or forced to resign on corruption charges after having to
disclose their personal assets.
Mr Kim's aura of success has been helped by an improving economy. Exports
rose by 9.6 per cent in 1993 as the Korean won fell against the yen, the
currency of its main trading rival, Japan.
The strength of exports has boosted investment, as companies have increased
production capacity, particularly in Korea's main export markets of
semiconductors, shipbuilding and cars. Factory expansion has been encouraged
by lower interest rates, which have fallen to 12 per cent from 17 per cent a
year ago as the government has sought to stimulate the economy by cutting
the cost of borrowing. Gross national product rose 5.3 per cent last year,
against 4.7 per cent in 1992, and is expected to grow by at least 6 per cent
this year.
Meanwhile, labour unrest has waned (the number of strikes dropped to 144
last year from 235 in 1992) and companies are forecasting improved earnings
this year thanks to the growth in exports. Corporate confidence has sent the
Seoul stock market general index towards its April 1989 peak of 1,006
points.
Taken together, the political reforms and surging economy made Mr Kim a
popular president last year, with approval ratings reaching 90 per cent at
one point.
But the president is now risking his popularity. He is trying to move the
country into a new phase, in which he hopes to keep South Korea on Asia's
economic fast track by tackling its traditional xenophobic attitude.
He has support for his attempts to persuade North Korea, locked in its
extreme nationalist doctrine of juche (self-reliance), to open itself to
foreign investment as well as international nuclear inspections. But he has
run into opposition at home with his promises to 'internationalise' the
South Korean economy, by increasing its exposure to market forces and by
dismantling protectionist trade barriers.
When he announced last November that South Korea would accept limited rice
imports as part of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt talks, opinion surveys
indicated that 60 per cent of South Koreans opposed the move. There were
daily demonstrations in the streets of Seoul. Protesters argued that rice
imports would throw farmers out of work and destroy Korea's strong
agricultural tradition. The cabinet was forced to resign in response to the
criticism, and President Kim's popularity declined to its current rating of
60 per cent.
Falling public support could eventually weaken the president's commitment to
economic reforms. Few dispute the president's personal belief in the need
for reform, but, as Mr Ahn Chung-si, a professor of political science at
Seoul National University, says: 'Kim is a populist and he closely watches
the opinion polls.'
'I'm convinced that Kim firmly believes that the internationalisation of the
economy is necessary if Korea is to stay competitive,' says one western
ambassador. 'The problem is that there is great resistence to change lower
down in the bureaucracy, because it means a loss of power.'
So far, Mr Kim's progress towards opening up South Korea has been tentative.
The government has produced a series of five-year plans to deregulate the
economy and liberalise financial markets to achieve its goal of joining the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 1996.
But most of the promised reforms are not scheduled to take effect until the
last two years of Mr Kim's mandatory single term, which ends in early 1998.
Some foreign businessmen worry this will give bureaucrats time to stall the
changes.
For example, the finance ministry tried recently to cool the stock market by
requiring advanced deposits on stock purchases from institutional investors.
Its action, described by the ministry as an anti-inflation move, has
discouraged foreign investment. It has also fuelled fears that the
government will try to delay a plan to increase the proportion of listed
shares that overseas funds can buy, currently 10 per cent.
'Appearance is often more important than substance in Korean society and the
issuance of five-year plans may be seen as a substitute for actual
progress,' says one frustrated western broker.
But the president may be ready to confront recalcitrant bureaucrats. He
appears to be seeking a tactical alliance with the chaebol, the country's
leading conglomerates, to push through his reforms. The chaebol welcome his
promises of cutting red tape and the lifting of state-imposed credit
restrictions.
When he came to power a year ago, Mr Kim attacked the chaebol for their
close ties with his conservative political opponents, and he promised to
reduce their industrial power. He is now praising them for pioneering
Korea's internationalisation efforts through their widespread activities
abroad, including in the European Union. He is encouraging bureaucrats to
study chaebol management methods and is sending his own staff to a
management institute run by Samsung, one of the biggest industrial groups.
But Mr Kim's change of attitude towards the chaebol may undercut public
support for his economic reforms. Many Koreans distrust the big
conglomerates because of their collaboration with the former military
dictatorship and the concentration of economic power in their hands.
Public suspicion of Mr Kim's plans for internationalisation has also been
stirred up by western pressure on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections.
The issue arouses anti-US feelings in South Korea, where the influential
media claim 'American hardliners' are raising tensions to persuade Seoul to
buy US weapons.
At the same time, the US is being blamed for forcing South Korea to open its
rice market. Small manufacturing companies and service industries,
threatened with increased foreign competition in the domestic market, are
exploiting such anti-US sentiment to build public resistance to the lifting
of trade barriers.
When the government recently announced that foreigners could operate private
educational institutes, the head of the domestic association of private
schools declared: 'What these foreign countries have in mind is to
disseminate their cultures as the surest way of selling more goods here. The
US is our biggest enemy as far as trade negotiations are concerned.'
Such declarations highlight the uphill battle Mr Kim faces in persuading
Koreans to accept internationalisation. A public backlash against his plans
could benefit the opposition Democratic party, which holds protectionist
views, in the 1996 parliamentary elections.
Liberalisation will increase economic problems in the short term, as it
forces companies, large and small, to rationalise and shed jobs in order to
become efficient. The danger for the president is that many Koreans may
rebel against making such sacrifices, rather than embrace the opportunities
for longer-term prosperity.
In spite of past successes, the economy is a source of concern among the
public, as opinion surveys indicate. Inflation is rising, reaching an annual
rate of 6.4 per cent in January. Unemployment, although low at 3 per cent,
is inching upwards as small industries relocate abroad to take advantage of
cheaper labour.
The president is still popular, but the painful changes he is prescribing
may whittle away the support he needs to see his reforms through.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Personal Viewpoint: Lesson in maximising human capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British education system is badly skewed. Performance is good at the
higher end, but inadequate at the primary and nursery level. To remedy this
defect, the National Commission on Education last November put forward
proposals in its report, Learning to Succeed (Heinemann, Pounds 4.99), to
recoup Pounds 1.3bn a year from public expenditure by 2000. This saving
would finance part of the Pounds 3.2bn-a-year public cost of its other
recommendations, notably universal nursery education, now accepted as a goal
by the prime minister, Mr John Major.
The NCE proposals are in line with current discussion by the government and
opposition on harnessing more private finance for public projects.
The average graduate can expect a good return on investment in a degree,
with higher lifetime income. Yet the risks and time-lags are such that few
would-be graduates can borrow from banks on expectations alone. The market
in investment in human capital has to be helped by government. This can be
done at lower cost to the public purse than grants and student loans, which
are both charged against the public sector borrowing requirement.
The present student loan scheme is entirely financed by the government
although some of the money is to be repaid in later years. The alternative
is to obtain finance from the private sector - banks, pension and insurance
funds - and give it a Treasury guarantee, in return for an assured return of
about  1/2 per cent over the cost of money. Such guarantees are given in the
UK for export loans, and in the US for student loans and some mortgages.
Loans would be as good as gilt-edged, and would thus not need capital to
back them in bank balance sheets. They could be securitised and traded in
the bond market.
Only the likely default percentage, not the whole loan, would be counted as
part of the PSBR. The default percentage would be reduced by changing
another Treasury rule - that the tax system cannot be used to collect
student loan repayments. The use of tax returns for this purpose would
reduce the risk of default. The NCE has put a high figure of 20 per cent on
the default risk, and it might well turn out to be less. The present sums
allocated for student loans could thus be made to go five times as far.
This scheme would involve higher interest payments than the present zero
real rates for student loans. The burden on graduates could be reduced by
giving tax relief on the loan interest, bringing it down from 6 per cent to
4.5 per cent at current figures. Savings from the phasing out of mortgage
interest relief could be recycled into student loan interest relief. As at
present, loan servicing would be suspended while graduates were out of work.
While they were in work it would be related to their income above a certain
minimum level. Once the interest and the loan had been repaid, graduates
would not pay any additional tax. The NCE has therefore called its scheme
the 'higher education contribution', or maintenance allowance, to show that
it is not a graduate tax.
Students would not be forced to enter the scheme, and would get a discount
for payment up-front. They would be expected to finance 20 per cent of
average tuition fees each year, and would be able to borrow their
maintenance at more generous levels than the present inflation-eroded
allowance, thus incurring a total obligation of perhaps Pounds 12,000 by the
end of a three-year course, repayable over up to 20 years.
This would end the present system of free tuition even for students from
high-income groups, without penalising those pursuing more expensive
subjects. It would avoid the most sought-after universities using the scheme
to finance top-up fees, enabling them further to enhance their relative
advantage. There would also be an end to the present grants for students
from lower-income households. The graduate's future income, not the parent's
present income, would determine the ability to pay.
This type of scheme is different from that turned down by the banks in 1989.
The banks were then expected to administer and monitor individual student
loans provided by the government, involving extra work without adequate
recompense. Here the roles would be reversed, with the banks and other
financial institutions providing the finance for loans guaranteed,
administered and monitored by the government, the student loan company and
the universities.
Private financial institutions should welcome the opportunity to invest in
the human capital essential for the UK to close the gap with its economic
competitors.

Will he, won't he? Now that the Church of England has swept away the last
barrier to women priests, what's to stop environment secretary John Gummer
becoming the first cabinet minister to convert to the Catholic faith?
Gummer, son of an Anglican clergyman, has been teetering on the brink for
ages. He resigned from the Synod last year because of his opposition to
female priests, and read the lesson at the first Catholic communion of Ann
Widdecombe, a junior minister at the Department of Employment.
If Gummer follows Widdecombe, the Duchess of Kent et al on the path to Rome
 -and the smart money is that he will - it will mean that the prime minister
will have one fewer experts to turn to the next time he has to vet a new
clutch of bishops.
Apart from that, the defection would hardly rock the government.

According to Janet Scott, president of the Beaumont Society, which runs
helplines for transvestites, having two photo cards could prove very
convenient for some cross-dressers. 'Those who are confident enough to go
shopping in their female persona would certainly want to have a second
card.'
And you could still blame the shopping spree on your other half.

Get on the right side of Jack Walker, the Blackburn businessman who sold his
steel stockholding business to British Steel for Pounds 330m, and he'll see
you right.
Yesterday, the 63-year-old Walker popped down to London on the way to watch
his beloved Blackburn Rovers play at Norwich, and launched his latest
adventure - a low-cost, high-security anti-fraud system called Datastrip.
It's far too complicated to explain in this column but Ed Mallory,
ex-Eastman Kodak and managing director of Datastrip, likens its potential
impact to that of Microsoft, the computer software firm. Heady stuff.
Walker, who already owns an airline, a lot of property and a football club,
admits that he's no high-tech expert. However, he has known John Watt, one
of Datastrip's founders, since the early 1970s, when Watt headed the
Northern Ireland Finance Corporation and Walker was keen to provide the
steel to build factories there.
When Watt, now an expert on credit cards, suggested the idea, Walker had a
'gut feeling' that he was on to a winner. Given the size of his fortune,
Walker could afford the punt.
But less fortunate entrepreneurs, tired of trotting round timid venture
capital firms, must wish there were more Jack Walkers around.

The environment is set to become a big issue in global trade policy. But the
question confronting members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
is how precisely to deal with it. The solution that seems likely to be
chosen at the April ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, convened to confirm
the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, is
establishment of an exploratory committee on trade and the environment with
loose terms of reference. That must be the sensible way to proceed.
The 118 nations that took part in the Uruguay Round agreed last December
that a comprehensive work programme on trade and the environment should be
put to the ministers. Since then they have come to realise that there is no
agreement on a committee's precise mandate or lifespan. Environmentalists
are understandably unhappy with this, since they fear that such a committee
will dodge the issues. Equally understandably, developing countries fear
that green attitudes mask a rabid new form of protectionism.
Since the international trading regime can only be based on consensus, an
agreement to explore issues must be the starting point. What makes this not
just essential, but right, are the difficulties of the issues.
Environmentalists want, for example, the right to discriminate between
identical products, on the basis of how they are produced. They also want
the power to impose anti-dumping duties on goods whose production involves
low environmental standards. Both these demands, questionable enough in
themselves, could evidently turn into excuses for increased protection. Rank
hypocrisy is another risk. People in the north complain, for example, about
the way developing countries are cutting down their rain forests, so
exacerbating global warming. But they tend to forget that the 15 per cent of
the world's population in rich countries generates 60 per cent of the gases
responsible for global warming.
While consistency between trade law and multilateral environmental
agreements must be secured, anything beyond that should be approached with
caution and humility. The starting point is an open-minded exploration of
such questions as the proper diversity in environmental standards, possible
remedies for international environmental spillovers and the degree to which
product prices reflect their full environmental costs.
Any new committee could not do better than start from the principles
outlined last December at the end of the Uruguay Round. Among them was the
statement that 'there should not be, nor need be, any policy contradiction
between upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable
multilateral trading system on the one hand, and acting for the protection
of the environment . . . , on the other'. This reconciliation is achievable
but its negotiation will, like the Uruguay Round, require years rather than
months.

The so-called 'wise men' of British economics have opened up the economic
policy debate, highlighted major issues and increased their saliency in
public discussion. They have also been a valuable sounding board for the
Treasury. This stimulus to public understanding is welcome, but there is a
case for taking the process further still.
The panel of economic forecasters was proposed by the former chancellor, Mr
Norman Lamont, in his 'Mansion House' speech of October 1992, which also
announced the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report. Combined with
the new inflation target, these changes defined the government's post-ERM
approach to economic policy. The panel, subsequently known as the wise men,
was to provide an independent benchmark for Treasury forecasts. It comprised
economists from all sections of opinion. Inevitably, they would disagree,
providing convenient cover for the Treasury's mistakes. But that
heterogeneity genuinely reflected the diversity in opinion.
The panel's latest report, published yesterday, underlined the persistence
of these disagreements. It also showed, once again, the emergence of strange
bedfellows. This time, for example, arch-monetarist Patrick Minford agreed
with the neo-Keynesian Wynne Godley, against the other four, on the need to
cut interest rates still further.
The publicity generated by this officially sponsored dialogue is greater
than the participants would secure on their own. They are, of course, not
the only good economists working on macroeconomics, but they are a capable
enough group.
The panel has proved its limited worth, but now needs to be supplemented. In
Germany the government funds six research institutions to produce rich and
detailed economic analysis. The UK, on the other hand, has moved away from
this. Starved of funds, many forecasters have closed. The government should
help support as many independent institutions as possible to provide
forecasts and analysis.
Another approach would be to establish an independent council of economic
advisers, on US lines, to publish regular forecasts and analysis. Such a
council could supplement, or substitute for, the Treasury's team of
forecasters. It would make sense as part of an attempt to reduce the
dominance of the Treasury over economic policymaking.
The chancellor of the exchequer may be tempted, instead, simply to sack the
wise men. This would bring the government a long way back towards business
as usual. What must not be forgotten, however, is that the panel was created
as part of an effort to defuse the anger and contempt born of policy
failure. The wise men should continue to shed light on the complexities of
the UK economy in preparation for the point at which inflationary pressures
again become a serious challenge.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Leading Article: HDTV blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only country to come out reasonably well from the long-running
high-definition television wars is the US. Japan's telecommunications
ministry yesterday effectively pulled the rug from under the country's
30-year attempt to promote its Hi-Vision system. The European Union
abandoned its campaign to promote its rival HD-Mac standard last year.
The cause of Japan's and Europe's expensive about-turns were realisations
that the technologies they were pushing were out of date. Both standards are
based on old-fashioned analogue transmission methods.
By contrast, the US standard, unveiled only last week by a 'grand alliance'
of high-tech companies, is based on digital technology. This has two main
advantages: digital signals can be compressed, allowing many more TV
channels to be transmitted over a given 'bandwidth'; and images can be more
easily manipulated and edited, making the technology more suited for the
emerging world of multimedia communications. Both Japan and Europe are now
likely to go down the digital route.
Japan and Europe failed in this field largely because they wanted to lead
the race in developing a new technology and lost sight of what consumers
wanted. They were therefore eager to fix their standards too soon, so
stifling innovation. The US government, by contrast, allowed time for ideas
to bubble before attempting to impose order. The grand alliance was formed
only last year.
US industry may now reap the rewards of its more market-led approach. A
shift towards digital television may offer US companies a route back into
the consumer electronics industry from which tough Japanese competition in
the 1970s and 1980s virtually excluded them. Computer companies, which
already have an expertise in digital technologies, may be among the biggest
beneficiaries.
But US industry will not find everything going its way. For a start, it is
still possible that Japan and Europe will seek to develop their own digital
HDTV standards. Even if they do not, it will be hard to deny Japanese and
European manufacturers access to US technology. The two biggest European TV
makers, Thomson and Philips, are in fact members of the grand alliance.
The bigger question is whether a market can be developed for the US
standard. Europe's HD-Mac collapsed because broadcasters were reluctant to
make programmes to its standard. Japan crossed that hurdle but fell at the
second: consumers baulked at spending hundreds of thousands of yen on a new
set when the only advantages were a wider screen and a somewhat sharper
image.
The US digital HDTV standard has advantages which neither of the analogue
standards enjoyed. But manufacturers will still face the same uphill task of
persuading consumers to scrap their current TV sets.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Green sheen on Whitehall machine: Bronwen Maddox questions
the depth of the UK government's environmental commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of green campaigners being dragged away last week from bulldozers
clearing a path for a motorway link in Wanstead, east London, can have done
little to enhance the UK government's efforts to build an environmentally
friendly image.
Only a month earlier, Mr John Major, the prime minister, personally launched
a set of policies for protecting the environment with an appeal to
'individual citizens' to change their way of life.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, recently attacked the
encroachment of 'urban sprawl' on the countryside and the construction of
shopping malls outside towns. On Monday he called for tighter protection for
green belts - the countryside encircling large towns, where development is
strictly controlled.
This level of activity is in sharp contrast to the government's low-key
approach to environmental issues last year. Mr Gummer's predecessor, Mr
Michael Howard, was forthright in saying last summer that recession had
pushed the environment down the political agenda.
The government's attitude is now more vigorous. 'There is no question that
Mr Gummer is giving countryside and conservation issues a lot of emphasis,'
says Mr Jim Turner of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, whose
members carry out much of the construction work causing Mr Gummer concern.
The government's change of tone prompts several questions: why is it now
paying greenery so much attention, and how deep is its environmental
commitment? Was last week's 'Battle of Wanstonia', as the media dubbed it,
an indication that government policy puts construction ahead of the
environment, or an unfortunately timed exception?
Part of the answer to the first question is Mr Gummer's own greenness. He
has adopted an evangelical approach to environmentalism, exhorting people to
switch off their lights when they leave the room, walk short distances
rather than drive, and put only one cup of water in the kettle.
He describes the quest for 'sustainable development' - preserving the
natural world for future generations - as 'the most important task of the
environment department'. He says this is more pressing even than the thorny
question of local government reorganisation, which also falls into his
portfolio. 'There is so much to do to achieve sustainable development, and
so many people to convince, it can't be put off,' he says.
Comments like this have won him support in the green movement, normally
critical of environment secretaries. According to Mr Ben Plowden of the
Council for the Protection of Rural England: 'Mr Gummer has introduced a
welcome note of plain language to the debate, and I think he appears to be
genuinely committed to these issues.'
A second reason for the flurry of activity lies simply in the momentum that
bureaucracy has acquired, environment department officials point out. The UK
committed itself at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to produce a series of
detailed reports setting out its strategy on a wide range of issues. The
work has occupied dozens of environment department staff.
Ministers say, too, that the department is currently free for the first time
in months from introducing large-scale primary legislation, allowing them to
spend more time on developing the details of green policy.
A third reason for this year's burst of greenery, some critics suggest, is
the local government and European Parliament elections in May and June. The
last European elections, in 1989, saw the Green party grab 15 per cent of
the vote, eclipsing the Social Democrat-Liberal alliance.
Backbench Tories are increasingly worried that the countryside and
conservation are sensitive issues which could surface in the southern
constituencies which are traditional Conservative heartlands.
Conservative MPs are concerned that conservation efforts are threatened by
present transport policies, notably the Pounds 23bn road-building programme.
Sir Geoffrey Pattie, Conservative MP for Chertsey and Walton, one of the
constituencies affected by the widening of the M25 motorway encircling
London, says: 'It is difficult to say how the issue will affect local
elections, but when I raise the M25 standard a lot of people flock to me.'
He has organised a group of about a dozen MPs to question the need for the
road-building programme.
The engineering contractors' federation has run repeated tests of backbench
opinion and found 'a very big change in level of support for the road
programme', according to Mr Turner. Until the middle of last year, 40 per
cent of MPs surveyed said infrastructure spending plans were 'inadequate',
but that figure has halved. More MPs now consider spending to be sufficient.
Rising concern about conservation among MPs and the public provide an
opportunity for the Labour party to go on the attack in the upcoming
election battles. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, says:
'People are getting more worried about pollution and destruction of
countryside. We will be wanting to make these an issue in the elections this
spring.'
Mr Gummer himself acknowledges that the environment is likely to be an
important issue in both sets of elections, although he calls it 'a constant,
underlying consideration for people' rather than one of their most pressing
concerns.
Critics of the government's environment policy argue that its recent green
pronouncements are superficial. And if the government is greening its
policies specifically with the spring elections in mind, they add, voters
will see through the surface presentations to underlying contradictions in
policy.
The best example of conflict, critics suggest, is that the government
appears repeatedly to put roads ahead of the environment. There are likely
to be more 'Wanstonias' staged by green activists, they claim. As well as
approval for the widening of the M25, the past year has also seen the start
of construction of the motorway through Twyford Down in Hampshire. The
scrapping of proposals for a highway through Oxleas Wood in south-east
London remains one of the environmental campaigners' few successes.
According to Sir Geoffrey Pattie: 'We must be getting close to some kind of
embarrassment point - Mr Major came out with this great spiel about
sustainable development, yet if you put the microscope over some of those
paragraphs they don't sit too well with transport policies.'
On a broader front, environmental pressure groups such as Greenpeace and
Friends of the Earth, together with opposition MPs, feel that the UK's
environment policy contains other anomalies. They have attacked the UK's
attempt to persuade the European Commission to give it more time to comply
with expensive water standards.
Mr Chris Smith says: 'European directives are the only reason we have proper
protection on drinking water - if the government were deliberately targeting
the green vote, it would not be trying to get drinking water standards
revised.'
Environmentalists also feel betrayed by the licensing of the Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant, last year's most controversial environmental issue. They
saw it as an indication that the government values industrial profit above
environmental concerns.
Mr Gummer's response to such criticisms is that it is always difficult to
reconcile environmental initiatives with other priorities. 'We no longer
intend to satisfy all the demand for roads that people's use of cars will
cause,' he says, but adds: 'There is no question that in some cases we need
more roads.'
He sees negotiation of these compromises as an inescapable part of his job.
But he will find it hard to remove a widespread perception that the
government has not yet matched its green words with green action. The extent
to which people care about this gap will be tested in the spring elections.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A workaholic - but only during
opening hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN RAYMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your self-assessment test on workaholism (Management: 'Are you a
workaholic?', February 18) certainly reflected the current, familiaphobic
obsession with quantity of work, rather than quality. The questions were
designed mainly to assess how much our work encroached on our private lives,
but none of them asked how productive we were during our normal working
hours or how well we thought we did our jobs.
I scraped into the 'You certainly take things easy' category. No, I work
hard when I am at the office so that I do not have to do it at home.
Conversely, if I twiddled my thumbs for part of the day, so that I had to
catch up with work at the weekend, I might make it into the 'reasonable
balance and healthy lifestyle' category. You can still be an alcoholic if
you only drink during opening hours. Why is it not the same for workaholics?

FT  23 FEB 94 / Uncle Sam's absence: The US attitude to Bosnia could
undermine Nato's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, 'believes we can build
on the Sarajevo model and use it in other parts of Bosnia', according to a
senior officer on his staff, quoted by Reuters on Monday. But the same day,
US President Bill Clinton proclaimed his wariness about issuing further Nato
ultimatums in other parts of Bosnia, warning that Nato should 'not undertake
a mission it is not able to perform'.
This is worrying, because Nato's ability to perform almost any mission
depends more on Mr Clinton's willingness to give the necessary orders than
on anything else. The threat to bomb heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area was
taken more seriously than earlier threats because the US, which would
provide the largest number of bombers, and France, which has the largest
number of troops on the ground, were both clearly determined to carry it
out. If Mr Clinton says he does not believe Nato can intervene elsewhere in
Bosnia, the chances are that others, such as the Serbs shelling Tuzla
airport and the Croats besieging Mostar, will not believe it either.
No doubt it would take time for Nato to agree on any further ultimatums,
even if the US pushes for them strongly. But that need not matter. What is
needed at this stage is for the Russians to warn the Serbs, and the Germans
to warn the Croats, that they are in real danger of being targeted by Nato
if they continue shelling and do not allow relief supplies to reach the
beleaguered population in areas still under Bosnian government control.
Of course, both protecting powers can say, no doubt in good faith, that they
strongly oppose air strikes against their proteges and will do their best to
block them - just as Lady Thatcher used to tell the South Africans, with
evident sincerity, that she was doing her best to resist further sanctions
against them. Such a distribution of roles is an essential part of the
diplomatic game. But it only works if the protector can say credibly that
his best efforts will be unsuccessful unless the protege takes significant
steps in the desired direction.
Mr Clinton's remark is therefore unfortunate. It tends to undermine the Nato
strategy for bringing peace to Bosnia which - however imperfect, however
tragically overdue - is just beginning to look as though it might actually
exist. Worse than that, it is symptomatic of a general US half-heartedness
about international commitments, particularly those with a military
ingredient, which is generating a lot of insecurity, especially in central
Europe.
The behaviour of Hungary is instructive. In 1992 Hungary welcomed Nato
surveillance aircraft (Awacs) to its airspace, for the purpose of monitoring
the UN-imposed no-fly zone over Bosnia. It also sought Nato guarantees
against Serbian retaliation, but its overriding concern was to play its part
in a Nato operation aimed at halting Serb aggression.
This year, when Nato issued its ultimatum to the Serbs around Sarajevo,
Hungary served notice that it would ban the Awacs overflights if any air
strikes were carried out. 'Hungary will not take part,' said Prime Minister
Peter Boross. 'We have to live with Serbia and the Serbian people for
hundreds more years.'
Hungary has suffered from economic sanctions against Serbia; it was
irritated at not being consulted by Nato before the ultimatum was issued,
which hardly chimed with the 'partnership for peace' it had just been
offered; and it is worried about repercussions for the 400,000 ethnic
Hungarians in northern Serbia (Vojvodina) if relations deteriorate further.
Still, the change in its attitude is eloquent. Eighteen months ago Hungary
was eager to back a Nato operation, and believed Nato could protect it from
any adverse consequences. Now it assumes a neutral posture as soon as things
get rough.
What has happened in between? Russia has become much more assertive. The
European Union has accepted the continued primacy of Nato in defence
matters. Nato has rebuffed applications for membership from Hungary and
other central European countries. The US has announced its withdrawal from
Somalia, after one incident in which 12 US soldiers were killed. And the US
has repeatedly refused requests from its European allies to put troops on
the ground in Bosnia. It did so again this week when Pavel Grachev, Russian
defence minister, suggested it should match Russia's action by deploying
troops in Sarajevo.
Mr Clinton did, in his televised statement on Monday, reiterate his
willingness to provide up to half the ground troops needed to help enforce
an eventual peace agreement in Bosnia, if he judged such an agreement
'enforceable'. But that pledge remains subject to congressional consent,
which will not be easy to obtain unless Mr Clinton throws the full weight of
his authority behind the request. That means that the hypothetical agreement
must be presented as a major achievement of US diplomacy, not a piece of
shabby realpolitik which the US has grudgingly accepted.
That in turn requires that the US play a much more prominent role in
negotiating a peace agreement than it has done up to now. There have been
some signs of this in the last fortnight, with Mr Charles Redman, the US
special envoy, trying hard to resolve the conflict between the Bosnian
government and the Croats. But to be effective, US involvement needs to be
at a higher level than that, and part of a much clearer overall strategy.
Not only Bosnia's fate, but the credibility of the Atlantic alliance and the
prospect for any effective security system in Europe, are now at stake.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: CIS initiative merits support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN AARONSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Lloyd argues ('Mr Absent without leave', February 19) that the
closer economic relations now being forged between several republics of the
former Soviet Union may reflect either 'a neo-imperialist impulse' on the
part of Russia, or 'an eastern version of the European Community'. No doubt
the motivation of some Russians comes under the first heading, but it would
be wrong to condemn all such moves towards closer integration.
Last week I was in Minsk (Belarus) on a European Commission technical
assistance mission and attended the inaugural meeting of the Commonwealth of
Independent States' council of anti-monopoly committees, which aims to
co-ordinate competition policy and law across the territories of the 12 CIS
members.
In many CIS countries the anti-monopoly committee is almost the only organ
of government actively pursuing market-oriented reform policies and each
hopes to gain moral and practical support from the others.
In time, this council could develop into a supranational competition
authority similar to DG1V of the European Commission, which is an important
part of the glue which holds the EU together.
Of course, Russia dominates the CIS economically to a far greater extent
than any one economy dominates the EU, and the first chairman of the council
will be a Russian. Nonetheless, his term is only for two years and each
country will have equal representation at council meetings. It is also
significant that the CIS secretariat is based in Minsk, not Moscow: the
Belarussians see the city developing into the Brussels of the east.
Western agencies are already supporting the work of individual anti-monopoly
committees, but there seems a good case for technical assistance to this
CIS-wide initiative as well. More generally, effective reform would be
advanced if the west made at least a rudimentary application of competition
policy a condition for financial assistance.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to rethink benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT A CRENIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint (February 17) concludes by
suggesting greater targeting of benefits by means testing ('the sums would
be much better used in improving income-related benefits and increasing
their take-up'). The rise in targeting benefits by income has occurred
throughout most of the EU states in the last decade. Although in itself
attractive, the concept of greater means testing is prone to lead to less
take-up of benefits. The reasons for individuals not to take up means-tested
benefits are the stigma attached, the costs of claiming that arise, or a
lack of sufficient information. The majority of non take-up is attributed to
the former two: stigma is likely to be an intrinsic feature of means-tested
benefits, and the process of means testing gives rise to costs to claimants.
The fact remains take-up rates for non-means-tested benefits have always
been considerably higher than those for means-tested benefits, in spite of
attempts by governments to encourage the latter. For social security to
survive into the next century, it is perhaps time to rethink social security
benefits as we know them and, instead, to consider some of the other options
such as a negative income tax.

<TEXT>
Sir, Bravo for setting us all straight on the real motives behind James
Elles's personal efforts as chairman of the Transatlantic Policy Network
(Observer, February 18). How could he have fooled not only Messrs Strauss
and Sutherland, but also the White House, half the cabinet, the US Congress,
the European Commission, the European Parliament, Her Majesty's Government
and European industry's principal representatives here in Brussels - not to
mention two dozen of the world's leading corporations (European and
American) - that he was really doing anything useful at all?
And how silly to have believed there are politicians whose motives are any
more high-minded than junketeering and re-election - or indeed that future
relations between Europe and America should cause anybody any legitimate
concern. It was high time to remind the naive that in these matters
Englishmen certainly know best. So praise be to Observer for being so
observant, and for saving us any need to continue our subscription to The
Sun.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protectorate for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY BLOOMFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Now that the siege of Sarajevo looks like being fully lifted, it is
time for the international community to move into other areas. For more than
a year our organisation has been promoting the idea of a United Nations
Transitional Authority for Bosnia (similar to the UNTAC operation in
Cambodia).
Last year at the Geneva talks it was agreed by all sides in the conflict to
establish a UN Protectorate in Sarajevo and an EU protectorate in Mostar.
Unfortunately, the establishment of these protectorates was tied in with an
overall peace settlement, but surely now is the time for a 'de-linking' from
an overall settlement and for those protectorates to be put in place now.
The idea of a UN administration seems to be gradually dawning on people both
within the UN itself and also in the outside world. Such an idea is a
sensible and practical way of ending the conflict and should be pursued by
the international community.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: Masterful 'Coppelia' - Ballet in Antwerp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP

<TEXT>
Belgium should be proud of the Royal Ballet of Flanders which I saw at the
Antwerp Opera House. It is now the country's only classical troupe, an
ensemble of clear, true gifts. That it is so is owed to Robert Denvers,
artistic director since 1987, who is also a celebrated teacher and has given
his troupe a bright cutting edge in performance.
It is this sense of an eager, disciplined troupe which makes the company's
latest acquisition, Coppelia, so welcome. The version has been mounted by
Attilio Labis, and decorated by Roger Bernard. The effect is very different
from the usual run of stagings which propose funny hats and rather too much
friskiness from the peasantry. Bernard's stage picture is of a skeletal wood
setting, very handsome but suggesting that we are in Old Fretworkburg, with
an added thought that the whole location might be an elaborate clockwork toy
from Coppelius' workshop (which is itself a madness of cogs and wheels,
merrily ticking away).
Equally stripped is the dance action. With no cosy inn or rustic shack,
there is no cause for peasant stampings and cheerless merriment by grinning
supernumeraries. The village is inhabited by dancers. Coppelius is something
of a cypher. The burgomaster is got up like Humpty-Dumpty en grande
toilette, and lurks. The choreography is the thing, and well done.
The action is traditional, but more aerodynamically trim than is usual.
Czardas and mazurka are given their full value, but Labis' text for the
first two acts is largely that which he knew at the Paris Opera, where he
was a celebrated etoile. The dance is light, bright; and it is brought off
with engaging style by a charming Turkish ballerina, Aysem Sunal, as
Swanilda, and by Eric Frederic as a buoyant Frantz. Sunal sails happily
through the steps, rejoicing in their delicacy; Frederic, with a strong,
sure technique, makes something attractive of Frantz, who is not the most
endearing of balletic characters.
The Flanders' dancers show admirably clean pairs of heels in the peasant
rompings (and Roger Bernard dresses them attractively). The octet of friends
who dog Swanilda's every move are delightful. Clean style, dancing that has
an 'open' quality with nothing pinched or prissy, make their appearance a
pleasure and Labis has treated them well. His innovations come with the
final act, which he has largely re-made.
Gone are many of the sacred old numbers, for Work and Prayer and Dawn - and
anyone else a weak-minded producer cared to bring in. The pretty Dance of
the Hours is a fantasy in which Coppelius dreams of fair women who turn into
dolls (which is, after all, the ballet's theme). The introduction of an
Arabian dance seems to me regrettable - we are suddenly being menaced by The
Nutcracker, just when we thought that the plague had passed. But, all in
all, the staging makes sense, and, given the skill of the Flanders' artists
dancing, it is a happy view of a musical masterpiece that sustains a dear
and not inconsiderable ballet.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: The Madness of Esme and Shaz - Fringe theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is the sitcom recipe: take two characters and arrange them so they
cannot live together and cannot live apart; blend them together, make them
unpredictable enough to change, but staid enough to remain the same. It
works with serious ingredients, too. But The Madness of Esme and Shaz by
Sarah Daniels at the Royal Court Upstairs is a good dish which stays too
long on the table; it starts hot and goes cold.
Esme, a retired civil servant, finds she has a niece called Sharon ('Shaz')
who has been in a secure psychiatric hospital for 13 years and is now due
for release. She offers her home to Shaz, whose swearing, smoking, drinking
and lesbianism at first seem like an affront to everything the God-fearing
Esme values.
A battle of wills begins, and a sad mutual past of child abuse emerges. A
partner of Shaz crosses their lives briefly, putting the feminist view of
men who abuse children: 'Most women are locked up just for losing their
temper.' At this point the play works well, the dialogue is trenchant and
witty, and the characters well defined.
But then Shaz, in a fine scene from the local Benefit Office, assaults a
police officer, and is sent back to the secure unit. Esme buys a replica
gun, sells her flat, rents a car she cannot drive, and springs Shaz from
jail to take her to a new life on the Greek islands - Mytilene, now Lesbos,
home of Sappho.
The central performances rather than the central characters carry the play.
Marlene Sidaway as Esme makes her grow and change in the direction of her
niece; she finds warmth and scope in a difficult part. Tanya Ronder as Shaz
is all angst and aggression, restless on stage and using her whole body to
play the part.
The versatile set (Kate Owen) is a triptych of doors and a raised platform
which keeps the action clean. Jessica Dromgoole directs.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: The Kitchen - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.' On the other hand,
President Truman's motto always seemed like an invitation to get into the
thick of it. And so it is with Stephen Daldry's magnificent revival of
Arnold Wesker's play at the Royal Court.
Even the theatre has been transformed. Part of the audience sits on what
used to be the stage. The huge kitchen is placed in what was once the front
stalls. Excitement rises on the moment of entry.
The Kitchen, first performed without decor at the Court in 1959 and then in
its present full-length version in 1961, can be seen on several levels.
First, it is a piece of triumphant theatricality: a cast of 28, bitching,
quarrelling, joking, loving, occasionally running amok but usually getting
on with the job of dishing up meals for a busy London restaurant.
No food is served; even Wesker recognised that cooking on stage would be
impractical. All that is mimed. For the rest, all the implements are there
and all the staff in their strange hierarchy: kitchen porters, waitresses
running in and out, pastry cooks, the chef and sometimes the restaurateur.
The production is worth seeing for this versatility alone.
The interchanges never stop, even when lunch-time demand is at its peak: an
odd flirtation here, a social comment there, a few broken plates, yet
somehow the service goes on. Watch, for example, the riveting performance by
the perpetually smoking Annette Badland in the minor part of Bertha, a
vegetable cook. I single her out partly because, in this theatre in the
round, she worked close to where I sat: if the other small players are
anything like as good, the production is even better than I have suggested.
The surprise is that the underlying symbolism remains effective. It works
because it is unobtrusive. The other meaning of the kitchen ovens is clear
without being stressed. A dark-looking Cypriot called Gaston in the kitchen
quarrels with one of the Germans, but they more or less patch it up. More
strikingly, the German Peter - the boiled fish chef and the main character
in the piece, played by Christopher Fulford - makes it up with the Jew.
There is an Irishman called Kevin (Dermot Kerrigan) who works on fried fish
and an English tramp (Sam Beazley) openly borrowed from Harold Pinter's The
Caretaker. All these characters act together: all have dreams, like Michael
the hamburger chef who imagines the football score Leyton Orient 18 Arsenal
nil.
The ageing restaurateur played by Ric Morgan makes his main appearance
towards the end wondering what has gone wrong when the place blows up. He
has paid high wages, done his best to serve his customers and is plainly
Jewish. Yet nothing is rubbed in and there is no preaching. The Kitchen has
stood the test of time: under Daldry's loving treatment it has matured. This
is a very humane play.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken almost the entire series of The Day Today to get used to its
peculiar mixture. The pastiche, such as Christopher Morris's habitual
caricature of Paxman, was hilarious from the outset.
Other aspects, especially the pantomime elements (police clamping the
homeless, say) seemed out of place. In the end it is a very funny series
which happens to take news and current affairs television as its subject
matter (9.15 BBC2).
Jayne Zito's husband was fatally stabbed 14 months ago by a schizophrenic
who had been 'released into the community'. Since then there have been at
least 14 other cases of killings by the mentally ill. Dispatches examines
the dangers in the government policy of releasing so many patients from
mental institutions (9.00 C4).
The producer of The Underworld apparently believes that this series 'in no
way glamorises crime'. Yet that is, of course, precisely what it does,
repeatedly and emphatically. The second episode (9.30 BBC1) deals with the
Richardson and Kray gangs in London in the 1960s.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: In the line of truth - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first people to practise eugenics (compulsory sterilisation to improve
the population) were the Nazis, right? Wrong. According to Channel 4's
Secret History it was the Americans who first ran a programme in Virginia
which was copied by Hitler.
The over-flying of Soviet territory during the cold war and the
photographing of Russian missile sites from very high spy planes was a habit
limited to the Americans. True? False. According to Timewatch on BBC2 the
American president told his military chiefs to stop it, so they got the RAF
to do it for them. All of a sudden you begin to understand just how special
the Special Relationship may have been.
Vladimir Pozner, the oh-so-charming apologist for hardline communism who
used to be wheeled into television studios by the politburo to use his
fluent New York English to pooh-pooh any suggestion of totalitarian
tendencies in the Soviet state (dissenters locked in asylums? Phooey]) was
presumably a favourite son of the Kremlin? On the contrary, Arena on BBC2
revealed that the Russian authorities distrusted him so much they would not
even allow him on Soviet television.
Formal apartheid, with the state setting up separate bodies to do the same
job, each staffed exclusively by people of one skin colour, is a policy
peculiar to South Africa? No: Network First on ITV recently told the
fascinating story of the USAF's 332nd Fighter Group, an all-black outfit
which, during the second world war, fought from segregated bases.
So the revision of history goes on. No doubt it always has, first by word of
mouth, then via the printed word. Pretty clearly most academic historians
still believe that the right and proper way to publicise new research or
circulate newly released material is via the article in the learned journal
or book. Yet the extent to which television is becoming a force in history
is unmistakable. A serious force? Hard to say, but certainly a popular
force.
When I was a boy it was not books but the cinema which taught us that the
bridge on the River Kwai, and by extension the Burma Railway, were built by
Allied prisoners of war; and that one of the greatest triumphs of that war
was the raid by the RAF's 617 Squadron on the Ruhr dams. Recent television
programmes have revealed that many of the men who built the Burma Railway
were enslaved Asians from Japanese occupied territories; and that while the
Dambusters did indeed smash a hole in the Moehne dam they failed completely
with the Sorpe. Since the very essence of this attack was that the Moehne
and Sorpe should be breached simultaneously, it is not merely parenthetic
that the Sorpe raid failed  - and failed because Barnes Wallis, inventor of
the bouncing bomb and boffin hero of the famous movie, miscalculated what it
would take to crack the massive earth embankments of the Sorpe. They proved
far stronger than the concrete curtain of the Moehne.
It is not hard to find people who deeply resent uppity young television
producers practising this sort of revisionism. Question the strategic value
of the dams raid and its cost in Allied lives, and you are poking holes in a
previously seamless web of patriotic pride. Yet it is surely better in the
end to know the truth . . . or at least to have it made available by a
programme such as Chris Haws' Secret History.
This was not one of those programmes that simply turn received wisdom upside
down or pour scorn on the fond beliefs of old men. It was more subtle than
that, acknowledging the propaganda value of the raid, and giving an account
of it that was considerably more complicated than that provided by the 1954
film. By interviewing the aircrew of the Lancaster bomber F for Freddie,
Haws and his director Alex Beetham brought out more vividly than any cinema
production the courage and compassion of the men who flew on such missions.
I shall not quickly forget the account by one of Freddie's crew of how it
felt to watch your friends in the Lancaster alongside you being shot down,
nor the thoughts upon looking down after the Moehne was breached and seeing
car headlights disappear under the flooding water. It is this sort of
personal witness - absent from movies and far less effective in print -
which brings such power to television's version of history. That is
doubtless what makes many academics so deeply uneasy. Just as Mary
Whitehouse believes herself immune to all that sex and violence that she so
selflessly monitors although it corrupts the rest of us, so historians
believe that only they are equipped to construe the evidence soberly from
history's witnesses. Not so. They may be more expert, but if television can
offer it to all of us direct, we should have the chance to see for
ourselves.
Of course there can be drawbacks to this steady increase in the volume of
televised history. The producers may be so determined to leave no
heartstring untugged, as with last week's Secret History on that American
eugenics scheme, 'The Lynchburg Story', that they end up with a programme
that feels more like fiction than fact. Here we had the commentary delivered
in stage whisper by an actress who sounded as though she might break into
sobs at any moment. As cameras panned around the empty rooms of the home
where candidates for sterilisation were held we were treated to mood music
worthy of Brief Encounter. In a story of this sort nothing is more moving
than the appalling truth.
More serious, more common, and far more difficult to overcome is the problem
faced by the makers of The Underworld, BBC1's new series about organised
crime in Britain (mainly London) since 1945. This comes to us with anxious
disclaimers about glamorising criminals which is, of course, precisely what
it does. Matters are not helped by interviewing grizzly safe crackers or
gangsters complete with year-round suntans and smart lightweight clothing on
Mediterranean locations: that sort of glamorisation could easily have been
avoided. What is almost impossible to overcome is the absence of documentary
material at the heart of these men's activities.
It is all very well to see someone sawing a chunk off a teeny little modern
starting handle and to hear the villain explaining how they used a
rubber-covered length (of a whacking great 1950s starting handle) to cosh
innocent people, but that is no substitute for actually seeing the mayhem.
What we get from these programmes is a succession of old men, keen not to
leave too bad an impression for posterity. What television needs, but of
course lacks, is some vivid footage of virile young thugs beating bank
messengers to the ground or terrorising innocent members of the public. We
need to see burgled citizens explaining at the time how it felt to have
their homes and furniture smashed to bits and then to be robbed.
What matters most in the end is the intention, integrity and intelligence of
the programme maker. We know from such magnificent series as All Our Working
Lives, End Of Empire and A Secret World Of Sex that detailed social history
is possible on television, even if political history tends to be easier.
Furthermore, programme makers are going to find richer and richer seams
because the archives are growing all the time: television itself will
eventually be the richest repository of our history.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Wozzeck' in Chicago - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the English National Opera did a few seasons ago, but over the span of a
decade, the Lyric Opera of Chicago is offering a conspectus of 20th-century
opera. There were grand plans for Wozzeck: a cast led by Franz Grundheber;
Daniel Barenboim to conduct; and a production by Patrice Chereau, his first
for any American opera company. But the production, which was seen in Paris
last year, turned out to be too expensive for Chicago in its lighting
demands, and so the Lyric Opera set about mounting its own instant version.
Luckily Franz Grundheber survived from the original plans. His Wozzeck here
is, as usual, grave and grey, sung out of a sort of somnolence, an embattled
numbness of spirit, but always capable of sudden rises or falls into
something sweetly melodious for a momentary phrase.
Another survivor from the original project is Graham Clark, who as the
Captain gives a brilliantly precise and vigorous performance, vocally
creating the image of a man who appropriates command as a thin, bright
shield for himself. But in other respects the casting is not so happy.
Kathryn Harries as Marie is hampered by a vibrato that slackly pulls down
the flying kite of her intensity, and Norman Bailey as the Doctor lacks
focus. The staging, too, is a mixed success. Put on the spot, Chicago called
upon a director with plentiful experience of this opera, going back to an
Edinburgh Festival production in the late 1970s: David Alden. This version
has his signatures (the bare light bulb, the blood-smeared surgical gown for
the Doctor), some of his abiding faults (the lack of a feeling of outdoors,
the diversion of musical developments - such as the crisis of the
Wozzeck-Doctor scene  - to support groundless stage business), and some
triumphant inventions, new and old.
Many of the most effective innovations come from the use of a ramp on the
stage up towards the audience, so that characters at the front seem enlarged
 -often grotesquely enlarged  - against the perspective provided by
furniture and people at the back of the set (designed by Charles Edwards).
The strong use of shadow also works to create powerful dissonances of scale.
However, some of the imagery is adventitious (an instance would be the
slantwise view of modern Chicago occasionally exhibited in a corner) and the
expressionist rhetoric is untrusting of the music. Unfortunately, the
orchestral score is not defending itself under Richard Buckley's baton: much
of the more discontinuous music is a tangle of inert blobs and streaks, and
the performance all through is short-breathed. Perhaps, under the
circumstances, this was the best that could be done. But the Lyric Opera
needs more than decent retrievals to support its fair claim to being
artistically as well as financially the healthiest of the big American
companies.

FT  23 FEB 94 / People: Williams wooed back to Mosaic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Williams, who quit Mosaic Investments in 1991 after a policy
disagreement, has been wooed back by the management of the one-time
high-flying mini-conglomerate to take up the post of executive chairman.
'The group is made up of entrepreneurs looking to build their businesses
within a quoted vehicle. One of the problems has been a succession of
chairmen, none of whom really knew how to handle them all,' says Williams.
Not very long after the previous chairman Andrew Davison had been appointed
 -in September of last year - Williams says he received a 'grand deputation'
from the management asking him to come back. 'I hate seeing things I have
been associated with go wrong.' Davison is to stay on as a non-executive
director.
Aside from the group's best known activity - character licensing for the
likes of Tom and Jerry and Thunderbird and once the Ninja Turtles - Mosaic's
other products range from spirit measures to coat-hangers to the creases in
restaurant menus.
After Williams, the acquisitions expert, left the company Mosaic ran into
serious financial trouble and substantially restructured. The share price
stood at 280p when he left; since then it has been suspended and relisted,
and yesterday it closed up 6p at 27p. Only one, non-executive, member is
left from the board with which Williams fell out.
Williams, 41, in turn had been running printing ink specialist Usher-Walker,
which he turned round and sold to Sun Chemical of America in the autumn of
1992. Since then, he says, he has kept his hand in in the City, 'doing
flotations and MBOs and the like'. He hopes that some of the still private
companies in which he has got involved might be candidates for the Mosaic
stable at some stage.
He also now reckons he has a good base from which to build. 'The company is
viewed as a rag-bag and a mess but it is debt-free. The strategy is to find
out the state of everything and then if necessary rejig all the pieces to
get some focus.'
Tomkins boss Greg Hutchings, who with Williams was one of the founders, left
the board in October 1992, but still retains a stake of just over 4 per
cent.

Du Pont opened the first large-scale CFC production site in 1931 at
Deepwater, New Jersey. When it closed, 60 years later, it was the world's
biggest CFC plant.
The shutdown was part of a worldwide reduction in CFC manufacturing as
makers of refrigerators and air conditioning systems switched over to the
ozone-friendlier HFCs.
Industry estimates suggest CFC capacity in the mid-1980s was about 1.2m
tonnes a year. Now, it is one third that level. Du Pont is nevertheless
still one of the world's biggest CFC manufacturers.
Other makers include the UK's ICI, France's Elf Atochem, Allied Signal and
LaRoche of the US, and Akzo of the Netherlands.
Some of these companies are switching rapidly to the production of HFCs,
though as a greenhouse gas, HFC may have production ceilings progressively
imposed. HFC capacity has risen from practically zero four years ago to
close to 100,000 tonnes a year now.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Middlesex Holdings, the renamed Ferromet Group headed by ex-England
cricketer Phil Edmonds, is the latest UK company to appoint a director from
the CIS.
Alexander Vladislavlev, the former first deputy minister of foreign affairs
for the USSR, will become an executive director and is expected to play a
key role in identifying business opportunities in the CIS. Middlesex owns a
variety of businesses around the world, including gold mining in the US, and
metal and petrochemical trading in the CIS.
Other companies to have gained CIS board representation recently include
Aminex, in natural resources, and Marine &amp; Mercantile, in petroleum
distribution.
Middlesex chief executive, Masoud Alikhani, an Iranian businessman who has
lived in the UK since 1979, injected his private businesses into the company
through a share subscription in November. He and a group of Russian
investors, four of whom are employees, own 29.9 per cent of Middlesex.
Alikhani says he intends to exploit opportunities for trading within the
CIS. The lack of a financial or trading infrastructure there gives Middlesex
an opportunity to provide essential trading facilities to the individual
republics, he says.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Climate cools to HFCs - The
industry's preferred alternative to CFCs is under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the last official publicity events undertaken by Tim Yeo, former UK
environment minister, was to be photographed with a CFC-free refrigerator,
one of 10 bought by his department.
He left office under a cloud, but the fridge is still there. Its presence
shows the attention given to environmental issues in the energetic debate
about the merits of the various CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) alternatives in
refrigeration.
Doubts have arisen over new, ozone-benign gases, called HFCs
(hydrofluorocarbons), and over the returns the chemical industry can expect
from its investments in the design and manufacture of these gases.
The debate is being fanned by the imminent end of CFC production in the
west, leaving the refrigeration industry dependent on existing stocks of the
gases.
CFCs are controlled by the United Nations under the Montreal Protocol, which
stipulates phase-out at the end of 1995. Members of the European Union must
cease production at the end of 1994, but existing stocks can be used after
that date until they run out.
Now, the environmental credibility of HFCs - long criticised by
environmental groups for their global warming potential - has been
questioned officially by the US and UK governments.
Not only is the Yeo fridge CFC-free, but it avoids use of the chemical
industry's alternative refrigerant, HFC 134a - made by Du Pont of the US
using the Suva brand name and by Britain's ICI as Klea. Instead, it uses
hydrocarbons, running on a butane/propane mix; its insulating foam was blown
with another hydrocarbon, cyclopentane. Until recently, nearly all domestic
fridges used CFC as the refrigerant and to blow the insulating foam.
Yeo's German-made fridge, Greenfreeze, is promoted by Greenpeace. The
environmental group has been largely responsible for re-introducing
hydrocarbons as a viable alternative to CFCs and HFCs.
Hydrocarbons and other natural gases such as ammonia were widely used as
refrigerants before CFCs were invented. Ammonia is used in large-scale
chillers, such as in ice-rinks, and in small fridges.
Most big German manufacturers have launched a hydrocarbon fridge or plan to
do so, although they are also starting to use HFC 134a. Bosch-Siemens of
Germany, for instance, recently said it would stop using HFCs as soon as
replacements could be found. By the start of 1995, more than 80 per cent of
its production will use hydrocarbons only. The rest - mainly frost-free
models - will use 134a as a refrigerant until an alternative is found.
'Until recently, 134a was to be the only alternative. Soon, it will not be
an alternative at all,' predicts Corin Millais, a specialist in CFC
alternatives at Greenpeace. But the threat to 134a and other HFC blends must
be seen in the context of the whole market for CFC alternatives.
The value to the chemical industry of the domestic fridge market is
'peanuts', according to Maurice Perrenoud, industry specialist at Du Pont
Fluorochemicals in Geneva. According to Mike Harris, an ICI spokesman, the
market comprises around 5 per cent of the total refrigeration sector, which
includes industrial chilling and air conditioning.
Du Pont and ICI see their main markets for HFCs emerging in the non-domestic
markets. 'Most new cars will be using 134a in their air conditioning systems
by the end of the year,' says Harris. Du Pont and ICI have spent heavily on
developing HFCs and building plants to make the chemical. Du Pont says it
has invested Dollars 500m (Pounds 300m) on CFC-alternatives, including
solvents, propellants, foam blowers and refrigerants. ICI's investment is
around Pounds 250m.
HFCs cannot replace CFCs without big changes in refrigeration technology. Du
Pont and ICI have had to develop new technologies, such as special
lubricants, to enable fridge makers to use HFCs.
Until recently, the chemical companies were worried about the slow sales of
HFCs and the lack of enthusiasm shown by potential customers. They now say
that sales are growing. 'It is looking that we built the right plants in the
right place, but with hindsight maybe six months too early,' says Harris.
Andrew Benson, chemicals analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, stockbrokers
to ICI, says hydrocarbons will not be a threat to the emerging HFC market
and he expects substantial increases in sales of HFCs.
Meanwhile, the refrigeration industry appears divided about the merits of
HFCs. Also, many are worried that if they decide to use HFCs, they might
become locked into a technology that could increase their costs and limit
choices later on.
This debate is obscured by technicalities surrounding the merits of various
refrigerants, the growing unease in some sectors about the global warming
potential of HFCs and the increasing emphasis on the energy efficiency of
refrigerants.
There are, however, three certainties. First, HFCs are not necessarily the
easy option for the refrigeration industry, although they will be used in
some circumstances. The biggest problem lies in making HFCs work with
systems designed for CFCs.
This is especially acute in the US where a large proportion of cars have
air-conditioning systems. Although manufacturers are offering to replace the
CFCs with HFCs and make the necessary technical changes, the process is
neither cheap nor necessarily effective.
This has led to the US government asking Du Pont to continue making CFCs for
a year longer than the company intended. Du Pont planned to stop making CFCs
by the end of this year, but the US Environmental Protection Agency says the
car industry needs another year for a smooth phase-out and to maintain its
warranty promises.
Second, more HFC alternatives will become viable as research progresses  -
Greenpeace can cite working technologies that use carbon dioxide and even
water. Hydrocarbons and ammonia, while suitable in some circumstances and
acceptable to some countries, suffer from safety problems. Ammonia is highly
toxic and has to be used under strictly controlled conditions, while
hydrocarbons are a fire hazard and potentially explosive.
Third, the refrigeration industry has been very slow to face the problem of
finding suitable alternatives before CFCs run out. It took Greenpeace to
show the fridge makers that there were existing and viable alternatives to
CFCs and HFCs. Without this impetus, it is unlikely that hydrocarbons -
which are only one alternative - would now be offered by leading makers of
domestic fridges.
Meanwhile, further complications grow. US President Bill Clinton's Climate
Change Action Plan, revealed last year, includes plans to control emissions
of HFCs. The UK government announced similar plans as part of its commitment
to the climate change treaty. This means HFCs could in the near future
become controlled gases in the same way as CFCs.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Arguing against tree tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A timber tax, suggested in London last month by Ioannis Paleokrassas, the
European Union's environment commissioner, could be environmentally
destructive, leading economists argue.
Paleokrassas, who wants a tax to discriminate between timber from virgin and
cultivated forests to help preserve native forests, has not yet taken steps
to make the proposal formal.
But Brazilian and Scandinavian timber producers have condemned his
suggestion as potentially protectionist. They claimed, too, that the largest
producers do not take wood from virgin forests and that a tax is
unnecessary.
Richard Sandbrook, director of the International Institute for Environment
and Development (IIED), a respected London-based think-tank, says that such
a tax might 'reduce the incentives for sustainable timber management'.
The heart of the IIED's criticism was set out in a report commissioned by
the International Tropical Timber Organisation last year, and written by Ed
Barbier, now a lecturer at York University.
The report says that, in the short term, a tax would cut a timber-producing
country's earnings. It might then encourage it to increase timber exports to
countries not imposing a tax to maintain its level of foreign exchange
earnings. In the longer term, a tax would cut producers' profitability and
might encourage them to convert forests - cultivated and virgin - to other
uses, they say.
Resistance to a proposed tax is hardly surprising. But EU countries have
been increasingly vocal in criticising Brussels for ignoring the impact of
environmental measures on industrial competitiveness.
The recent near-bankruptcy of the German packaging recycling schemes is also
a reminder of how unpredictable the results of ill-thought out policies can
be.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Aircraft emissions sky high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Considering the number of aircraft in the sky, surprisingly little is heard
about their effect on the environment. Yet aircraft emit large quantities of
pollutants, often at high altitudes where their effect is greater than at
sea level.
Leonie Archer's new book* does not claim to break new research ground but
puts the case for a more concerted approach to the problem.
It is very difficult to measure aircraft emissions at high altitude. Most of
the statistics are estimates based on fuel consumption figures. Furthermore,
the emission regulations for aircraft were last revised by the International
Civil Aviation Organisation in 1981 and only apply up to 3,000 feet, after
which aircraft are deemed to be 'cruising'. So there is little regulatory
pressure on manufacturers to fit cleaner engines.
The book suggests there is a consensus that civilian aircraft emit about
550m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year - equivalent to about 3 per cent of the
carbon dioxide created by man. Aircraft also account for 2-3 per cent of the
nitrous oxide and 0.18 per cent of the sulphur dioxide. These are not
alarming amounts, but at high altitudes may damage the ozone layer by
enabling acid to form.
Aircraft cause the greatest potential damage by emitting water which, when
it freezes, creates a thin veil over the sky which could contribute to
global warming by reflecting back the earth's heat.
There are several ways to restrict the environmental impact of the expected
growth in air travel. Technology can improve aerodynamics and engine
efficiency. Air traffic control can also be improved to shorten journey
times.
Archer says much can be done by tightening regulations and researching the
impact of aircraft emissions more closely.

FT  23 FEB 94 / People: Dawson to step down from F&amp;C
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, whose funds under management have grown from
Pounds 2bn to Pounds 10.5bn in the space of five years, has looked outside
to replace its chief investment officer, Oliver Dawson, 63, who is stepping
down within nine months.
James Ogilvy, F&amp;C's chief executive, purposely employed an American firm of
headhunters to find Chilton 'Tony' Thomson who had been chief investment
officer at Bankers Trust Global Assets Investment Management.
'We needed someone who could pull the whole thing together,' Ogilvy
explains. 'We are contrarians and we are very good at stock-picking. But we
are now a very much bigger business. Without abandoning the bottom-up
approach, we need a well-structured asset-allocation strategy and hence
someone with slightly different qualifications from Oliver.'
F&amp;C has just appointed its first chief operating officer, which Ogilvy sees
as another reflection of the sort of infrastructure demanded by a larger
operation.
Dawson, whom Ogilvy describes as a 'brilliant academic', had been senior
partner of Buckmaster &amp; Moore before joining F&amp;C in 1980. He stepped down as
chairman of F&amp;C Management in October 1992. He will however continue, pro
tem, to manage the roughly Pounds 600m of funds under management from some
Cambridge colleges, business that he brought with him to F&amp;C.
Thomson, a 51-year-old American who has lived in the UK for many years and
is married to an Englishwoman, had worked on the asset management side at
Morgan Guaranty and American Express before joining Gartmore in 1989. He
left there for Bankers three years later.
Ogilvy defends Thomson's somewhat peripatetic career. 'His one mistake,
certainly financially, was to go to Bankers.' While Gartmore has in the
meantime been floated, Bankers decided recently to try and pull its
international investment management business back to the US. Thomson was
offered the chance to move to New York.
F&amp;C, Britain's oldest investment trust, has 16 nationalities on the staff -
'mostly on the emerging markets side', according to Ogilvy  - but Thomson
will be only the second American. (See Observer)

FT  23 FEB 94 / Management: An invitation to think afresh - Book Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR GRAHAM DAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It says something about the difficulty of describing Charles Handy's latest
book that its title is different in Britain and the US. In Britain it is
entitled The Empty Raincoat; I read The Age of Paradox*, the version
published in the US, in which there were 'several structural changes'.
Handy's other published work is hard to describe and this book is no
exception - there is no neat bookseller's slot which suits. It is not a
textbook and certainly not a business book expounding the latest management
fad. I have the same difficulty with Peter Drucker's books.
Handy's earlier book, The Age of Unreason, is written by a thinker who
wishes to stimulate others to think, hopefully some of them in business. If
the management of business is more than just earning a living and if, in the
broadest sense, such management must evolve, then the very few writers -
Drucker and Handy are two  - who write conceptually and philosophically
about business, are precious. Handy has a significant advantage over Drucker
because he writes so well.
However, The Age of Paradox is not for business people exclusively - that
would be much too narrow an audience. If you are part of, think about, care
about, or are in any way influenced by the world of work, and who is not,
this powerful and moving book is for you.
I am now much less comfortable than I was before reading it. If that was his
intention, in relation to the management community, then, at least with me,
he has succeeded.
However, I suspect, honest man that he is, that Handy had no such intention
and wrote as he did partly out of some retrospective dissatisfaction with
the positiveness of The Age of Unreason. To those who enjoyed this book,
beware. The Age of Paradox is a sequel only in the sense that it follows The
Age of Unreason in time.
The Age of Paradox is deceptively easy to read. The writing is so good and
the style so smooth that one is caught up, initially, with sheer enjoyment
in the act of reading. It is not until the various propositions, gently
advanced, are taken on board that disquiet arises.
If, as a manager, one has tried to think larger thoughts to contemplate an
end game for one's nation, business or self, then The Age of Paradox is
worrying. I recognised a little too much of the corporate me, and did not
like what I saw. But what I saw was the truth. That is not to say that,
other than for the purposes of this review, I would have turned from the
book. On the contrary I was virtually enthralled by it.
Some fundamental ideas are advanced. The most compelling is that the
organisations in which we work are less and less relevant to the business
challenge. It is as if someone, in this case Handy, had directed my
attention to a reality which previously, at best, I perceived but dimly.
This invitation both to rethink and think afresh is the book's chief appeal.
Frequently I wanted to say, in happy surprise: 'That's it] Exactly.'
The thought occurred that Handy was writing for his and my generation. I
considered whether present generational dissatisfaction might have coloured
the book but, by the time I had finished it, I had concluded this was not
the case. Age and experience may have contributed, and so they should, but
the book's appeal is not to any particular generation.
I suspect with some satisfaction that economists will generally dislike the
book; all those ideas and insights but no graphs or tables and only a single
curve, the Sigmoid. Economists aside, I would prescribe The Age of Paradox
particularly for middle managers, university vice-chancellor aspirants and
all politicians below 50. This cross section, if they read with open minds,
could be helped a little to make a future difference.
Finally, I was struck by the book's basic morality. Not judgmental, but
putting human concerns before the reader when describing thoughts and
concepts which are about people and their behaviour, not about transient
organisational structures.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Management: Styles of execution - In light of the BMW-Rover
deal / A look at the contrasting attitudes between German and British
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As BMW and Rover begin to get to know each other, and start deciding how to
achieve the Bavarian company's goal of collaborating without destroying
Rover's motivation and British character, new evidence has emerged of the
deep gulf which separates managerial attitudes and behaviour in many German
and British companies.
The gap is so fundamental, especially among middle managers, that it can
pose severe problems for companies from the two countries which either merge
or collaborate, according to a study by a team of German and British
academics called 'Managing in Britain and Germany', which will be published
this autumn.
The phenomenon manifests itself in the contrasting attitudes of many Germans
and Britons to managerial expertise and authority, according to the
academics, from Mannheim University and Templeton College, Oxford. This
schism results, in turn, from the very different levels of qualification,
and sorts of career paths, which are typical in the two countries.
These contrasting patterns encourage many German and British managers to
hold opposed views of the nature of management itself, according to a
working paper by the German side of the team, under Alfred Kieser.
The academics' conclusions are based on a comparative study of three
industries - brewing, construction and insurance  - but are in line with the
results of several broader studies over the past 20 years.
The project leader, Rosemary Stewart of Templeton College, says the gulf in
attitudes and behaviour may be narrowing in high-technology industries such
as electronics, but she doubts whether they are doing so to the same extent
in the motor industry.
German managers - both top and middle  - consider technical skill to be the
most important aspect of their jobs, according to the working paper. It adds
that German managers consider they earn their authority with colleagues and
subordinates from this 'expert knowledge', rather than from their position
in the organisational hierarchy. Half the German managers in the study did
not even mention their leadership responsibilities.
By stark contrast, British middle managers see themselves as executives
first and technicians second, says the working paper. The term 'management',
it continues, 'was on everyone's lips', but more than a third of them did
not even mention technical responsibilities. In some cases this may be
because they do not possess the requisite technical expertise to do their
jobs in a way which their German counterparts would consider effective, the
academics suggest.
As a result, German middle managers may find that the only people within
their British partner companies who are capable of helping them solve
routine problems are 'operatives' who do not have management rank, conclude
Kieser and co. Such an approach is bound to raise status problems in due
course, but 'there seems to be no way out given the current lack of
knowledge of each other's system'.
Other practical results of these differences in attitude include a greater
tendency of British middle managers to regard the design of their
departments as their own prerogative, and to reorganise them more frequently
than happens in Germany, say the academics.
German middle managers can have 'major problems in dealing with this', they
point out, since British middle managers also change their jobs more often.
As a result, UK organisations often undergo 'more or less constant change'.
Of the 30 British middle managers in the study, 13 had held their current
job for less than two years (compared with only three in Germany), and
another 12 (seven in Germany) for less than four. One British insurance
company manager had changed jobs nine times in eight years, and a
construction company manager seven times in 11 years. Many of the Britons
had also moved between unrelated departments or functional areas.
In contrast, all but one of the Germans had stayed in the same functional
area. Twenty of them had occupied their current positions for five years or
more (12 of them for more than 10), compared with only five of the Britons.
The Mannheim researchers almost certainly exaggerate the strengths of the
German pattern; its very stability feeds the rigid attitudes which stop many
German companies from adjusting to external change. But the academics are
correct about the drawbacks of the unstable and technically-deficient
British pattern. And they are right in concluding that the two countries do
not merely have different career systems but also, in effect, different ways
of doing business.
That does not necessarily mean that the findings of the Mannheim-Templeton
study should be taken as a direct warning to BMW and Rover. The latter's
ability to learn from its long relationship with Honda has made the
attitudes of many of its managers more Japanese than British - especially as
regards the technical content of their jobs, as well as the source of their
own organisational status. On both counts, Japanese and German attitudes are
not too far distant from each other.
In contrast with the long line of academic studies cited by Stewart and
Keiser, other researchers have concluded that the variance of managerial
attitudes between industries can in some cases be greater than it is between
countries.
If this reading proves correct, Rover's managers could find that they have
relatively few differences with their new BMW masters. But the truth is
likely to lie somewhere in the middle, with the Stewart-Keiser study having
more than a modicum of relevance for both the Bavarians and the Brits. It
certainly does for companies in many other industries.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Recruitment: It's all changing in the Footsie shuffle - Jobs
/ Putting finance directors in their place is no longer as straightforward
as before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Job shuffling among finance directors in Footsie 100 companies appears to be
establishing a discernible pattern.
As Caradon, Redland and Prudential all seek to fill finance director
vacancies, what might have seemed straightforward musical chairs is
developing more complex characteristics as companies and individuals embrace
fundamental considerations about the general role of the finance director.
City headhunters are reporting an increasing desire among large employers
for more rounded career profiles among potential finance directors. They
want strategists as much as they want accountants. The days of the boardroom
number cruncher whose main concern is a polished set of accounts now seem to
be on the wane.
Gerald Corbett, the outgoing director of finance at Redland, about to move
to Grand Metropolitan in April, and Archie Norman, who was finance director
of Kingfisher before becoming chief executive of Asda in October 1991, are
cited as the new role models for a changing breed.
The moves appear to support evidence collected by Sir Geoffrey Owen,
Professor Peter Abell and Mike Cranna at the London School of Economics.
Their recent report, The Changing Role of the Finance Director, carried out
for the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business, identified a desire for
finance directors to have broader business responsibilities.
Most of those surveyed said that the job would become more entrepreneurial.
At the same time the report found that the role was becoming increasingly
demanding with more complicated functions.
This is not to say that traditional qualifications are no longer valued. An
accountancy background and a degree would be considered essential by most
leading companies. According to Carolyn Eadie of Spencer Stuart, the ideal
CV for a financial director in a top public limited company might show
combinations of accountancy, an MBA, treasury qualifications and experience
as a strategy consultant. 'They could have a grounding in any of these four
areas but qualifications in two of them might be expected,' she said.
She added: 'There are still lots of people running big companies with few or
no qualifications but it's a dwindling group.'
The corporate finance route is still there but it appears to be becoming
less fashionable. Philip Hampton, who joined British Steel from Lazards in
1991 and Patrick Dayton, who went to English China Clays from Schroders in
1992 are two examples of younger men who made the transition.
John Hignett, whose retirement from the main board of Glaxo was announced
this month, was in his mid 50s when he made the move a few years earlier.
Hignett's corporate finance background as a managing director at Lazard
Brothers merchant bank and a former head of the City's Takeover Panel was
considered by some as an atypical preparation for such a post even then.
Glaxo took a year of soul-searching, including advertising the post in
newspapers, before falling back on the old boys' network.
Hignett relinquished the finance director job more than a year ago while
remaining on the Glaxo board, allowing John Coombe to slot into the role.
Coombe now absorbs the rest of Hignett's duties, covering management and
investment of corporate funds.
Not all transitions are achieved so smoothly. Reports by recruiters of more
boardroom shuffles in the pipeline may lead to some discomfort for insecure
executives unaware that headhunters, operating in secrecy, are looking for
replacements. In practice the unfortunate incumbent is often alerted, either
intentionally to soften the blow or by a tip off on the boardroom
grape-vine.
Headhunters Norman Broadbent say that filling the post of finance director
is the most sought-after requirement for top professional recruiters at
present.
As companies seek to refocus themselves some finance directors such as
Daniel Cohen at Caradon and Michael Pragnell at Courtaulds have changed
roles to adopt other board responsibilities. Movement inevitably creates a
knock-on effect in the market for leading executives and the emergence from
recession is increasing confidence not only in companies preparing for
growth but in individuals who have been positioning themselves for a career
leap over years of inactivity. Playing Footsie with finance directors may
have only just begun.
City Screen, the on-line magazine available to users of the Reuters service
in the financial markets, has started a job advertise- ment section. The
company believes that its rates - Pounds 400 for a single insertion running
a week, discounted for longer runs - will compare favourably with newspaper
advertising. Details of the service from City Screen UK, 146-148 Cromwell
Road, London SW7 4EF. Tel: 071-835 1616.
The table (left) shows a selection of findings from Day Associates' latest

FT  23 FEB 94 / Prices hamper Europe's competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The study raises 'serious issues' about Europe's competitiveness against the
US in telecommunications, according to its author.
Mr Robert Harrison highlighted the large difference between national and
cross-border charges for leasing lines in Europe, and the much higher cost
in Europe of renting very high-capacity lines of the kind needed to provide
multi-media services.
The cost of leasing 1.5 MBit lines between France and Germany was found to
be more than double that of leasing similar lines within either of the two
countries.
The cost of very high capacity lines, providing 34/45 MBit circuits, was
also starkly different, costing more than 2.6 times as much as much for a
50km link in the UK compared with the US. Charges were higher still in
Germany.
Germany also scored poorly in cost terms. The report suggests that its state
telecommunications company pays far more than international market prices
for equipment, hampering its ability to modernise its network.
Mr Harrison said: 'Multinationals, in particular, tend to look at Europe as
a whole, not one country, so these differentials must be a cause of
concern.'
He said they might be a barrier not only to location, but to innovation,
because of the need for low-cost broadband capacity to encourage
organisations to experiment with new applications.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Telecoms are high in world ranking: BT charges most for
domestic use, says DTI survey of advanced nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's telecommunications rank a 'a good second' internationally, says a
government study comparing telecoms in the UK with those in six other
advanced countries.
The study - comparing everything from prices to network modernisation - does
not find the UK the most advanced in any sphere, though no one country was
consistently better. The US scored higher on many counts.
Britain was found to have the most expensive residential calls of any of the
seven countries, however, with average charges almost twice those in Sweden
and the Netherlands.
The figures were based on British Telecommunications charges as at January
1992. Its prices are now undercut in parts of the residential market by
Mercury and the cable companies. BT has cut residential prices sharply since
1992 - but so have companies in the other six countries.
The study, part of the exercise in rating UK industrial sectors against
those of other countries that was launched by the Department of Trade and
Industry last year, was hailed by the government as support for its policy
of liberalising telecommunications infrastructure and services faster than
the rest of the EU.
The UK will soon have three long-distance telecoms networks and cable
companies - mainly US-owned - are investing nearly Pounds 5bn in building
local TV and telephone networks in competition with BT.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'Competition in
telecoms infrastructure as well as services has played a large part in
stimulating the adoption of leading-edge technology in UK networks.'
The report, compiled by Mr Robert Harrison of PA Consulting Group, found
Britain was fourth out of seven in deployment of fibre cable in the core
network, the essential requirement for broadband services of the kind
envisaged by proponents of a 'superhighway' that would offer advanced
interactive services.
Figures for investment in the network also provide an ambiguous picture.
Britain is ranked behind Germany, Japan and the US in terms of investment
per line, but comes out second behind the US when the figures are adjusted
for price and specification of equipment.
The UK scored highly in the provision of digital lines, enabling the
provision of advanced network services, where it was ranked second behind
France; and also in the take-up of cellular mobile services, where it is on
a par with the US although still some way behind Sweden.
The report noted a view 'held by some in the industry' that a 'clearer
vision' was needed of national telecoms objectives. It also said an issue of
concern was the poor regard in which telecoms services were widely held in
the UK.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Growth figure for end of last year revised upwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was slightly stronger
than previously estimated, with gross domestic product increasing by a
seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent, up from the earlier estimate of 0.7 per
cent.
Figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that for
last year as a whole GDP was 2 per cent higher than in 1992. If oil and gas
are excluded, the rise in GDP was 1.7 per cent, down from the 1.8 per cent
previously estimated.
Economic output in the fourth quarter of last year was 2.6 per cent higher
than in the same period of 1992. If oil and gas are excluded the increase
was 2.2 per cent.
Construction output, which was previously seen as flat in the fourth
quarter, is estimated as having risen by about 1 per cent between the third
and fourth quarters. This factor is mainly responsible for the upgrading of
fourth-quarter GDP growth.
The figures give a more detailed breakdown of the economy than was available
in the preliminary GDP estimate, published in January. They show that
stockbuilding played a substantial part in fourth-quarter growth, with the
value of stocks rising by Pounds 597m.
Capital spending by manufacturers was flat in the fourth quarter and 2 per
cent lower than in the same period of 1992. Gross domestic fixed capital
formation fell 0.3 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1992 and last
year.
The statistics show that one measure of inflation, the GDP deflator, is
gathering pace. According to the CSO the deflator rose by 3.5 per cent for
last year as a whole, the lowest annual rise since 1968. In the fourth
quarter, however, the deflator rose 1.7 per cent and was 4.5 per cent higher
than in the same period of 1992.
The GDP deflator is calculated after subtracting the effect of import
prices. Since import prices have been falling, this indicates that
home-based inflation is higher than shown by other measures.
Analysts differed on the importance of the deflator. Mr Robert Barrie of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd said it was a sign that companies had been increasing
their margins with price increases. Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg
Securities pointed to the poor quality of the trade statistics, which are
used to calculate the GDP deflator. He said the consumers' expenditure
deflator, which was growing at an annual rate of only 3 per cent in the
fourth quarter, was a better indicator of inflationary pressures.
One sign of improved company margins was a 22.9 per cent rise in the gross
trading profits of companies last year. Profits in the fourth quarter were
26.9 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992.
The gross trading surplus of public corporations rose 50.1 per cent between
1992 and last year. The CSO said this rise might have been caused by the
addition of new entities to the sector, such as National Health Service
trusts.
Meanwhile, income from employment rose 2.9 per cent between 1992 and last
year, the lowest growth rate recorded since the series started in 1948.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Gazumping complaints rise steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gazumping has risen sharply in the housing market, within a climate of
increasing complaints made to the corporate estate agents' ombudsman,
according to his report published yesterday.
Mr David Quayle, ombudsman, said that the number of initial inquiries within
the terms of reference of the voluntary scheme rose to 965 last year
compared with 701 in his report for 1992. Cases completed rose to 198, an
increase of 45 per cent over the previous 12 months.
Mr Quayle used the publication of his report to call for urgent reform of
the process of house buying. He said that it 'should be simpler and faster
and give those involved a greater degree of certainty'.
The ombudsman found for the first time in favour of more member agencies
than complainants, a development which Mr Quayle attributed to stricter
adherence by members to the code of practice. Complaints last year also
reflected for the first time more initial enquiries from buyers than by
sellers.
Initial enquiries about gazumping rose to 100 last year from the 32 noted in
the 1992 report. While this does not make it the largest area of complaint -
that is still maladministration - it is the fastest growing, and Mr Quayle
said it was the 'single issue causing most anger' among complainants.
Mr Quayle renewed his criticism of the practice of lenders telling estate
agents to obtain 'best and final offers', because of complaints from buyers
who seemed to have provided the best only to be overtaken by a later one.
The practice was particularly prevalent in the disposal of repossessed
properties by organisations such as banks and building societies.
Mr Quayle also expressed concern that 'over-computerisation' produced
dangers that the nuances of conversations between agents and buyers and
sellers were not properly recorded. The highest award made was for Pounds
5,500 and most of the 71 awards made were for less than Pounds 500.
The voluntary scheme, which was set up in 1990, covers about 90 per cent of
corporate estate agents, but does not include independent agents.
The report covers 16 months, as it takes account of a change of year-end
from end-August to end-December.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Ashdown alleges Tory split on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown last night gave a foretaste of the Liberal Democrats'
European election campaign, combining remarks highlighting the benefits
Britain derives from the European Union with a passage mocking the
Conservative split on Europe.
The Liberal Democrat leader called for a 'Europe-wide strategy of investment
in training and infrastructure', especially transport and information
technology.
'Information highways . . . will bring jobs and opportunities to regions
scarred by the collapse of traditional industries and to the remotest parts
of our islands,' he said.
Mr Ashdown, speaking in London three days before the European People's party
 -the Conservatives' federalist allies in the European parliament -
publishes its manifesto for June's elections, said the Tories were split on
Europe.
This meant government policy was geared to 'holding together a fractured
party' and not to promoting Britain's best interests.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was leading two parties, a moderate,
pro-European party symbolised by Conservative MEPs in Brussels and a
'negative party of rightwing xenophobes' who made 'nasty speeches about
foreign benefit-scroungers and corrupt foreign politicians'.
The Liberal Democrats are confident of making headway in the elections at
the expense of the Conservatives, particularly in south-west England.
Mr Ashdown said the challenge for pro-Europeans was to transform the
European ideal into something which mattered in people's 'practical everyday
lives'.
He said Britain received 40 per cent of all EU support for the redevelopment
of declining industrial regions and 50 per cent of the Rechar budget to help
economic regeneration in coalfield communities.

FT  23 FEB 94 / BR to compete for service franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail plans to take an active part in bidding for franchises for
parts of its own network, it emerged yesterday.
It had previously been widely assumed that BR would have a passive role,
buying parts of the network for which there were no other bidders.
BR will still have to satisfy Mr Roger Salmon, the franchise director, who
will oversee the bidding process, that it is not misusing its powers to bid
to run railway services. However it plans to remain an active operator of
train services.
'The view of the BR board is that it will bid where it can and seek to make
services profitable,' BR said.
'We will bid where we are allowed and where it makes commercial sense. We
will positively go out there and won't get franchises by default.'
BR takes the view that its long experience of running the railway network
will put it in a strong position to provide value for money from any
franchises it wins.
'It would be irresponsible not to bid, knowing we were the most
experienced,' it said.
BR's plans to bid for franchises appear to have been fortified by a belief
that there will not be many bidders.
The first franchise, for the Gatwick Express airport service, is due to be
offered for sale at the end of 1994 with a further seven expected to go on
sale in 1995.
When the government framed the railways bill it excluded BR from bidding for
franchises because this would place management teams keen to stage buy-outs
in a very difficult position.
Last-minute opposition in the House of Lords, however, led to an amendment
which allowed BR to bid if no credible private-sector bidder emerged.
In an apparent attempt to defuse criticism from managers who might want to
stage buy-outs, BR said that if it won any franchises it would operate them
commercially before selling them on to management buy-out teams or to
private buyers.
Mr Salmon said he would consider any bid for a franchise seriously but he
did not think that BR would be permitted to bid in the early stages of the
auction.
'In the early days I would expect there to be buy-out bidders who would have
difficulty bidding against their own employer so I would be inclined to
resist a BR bid.'
Mr Salmon said there had been no change in his office's policy towards
bidders but he would be opposed to BR bids if they discouraged other bidders
and reduced competition for a franchise. He said he would have no objection
to BR selling on a franchise to an acceptable purchaser.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Faster inquiries aim to cut years off road building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday gave details of proposals aimed at shortening the
time taken for public inquiries into new road schemes.
With recent measures to reduce the length of the planning process, the
effect of the proposed changes could be to cut total time taken to plan and
build new roads from an average of 13 years to only eight, the transport
department said.
The government hopes to have the new rules in place by the summer after a
three-month period for public consultation, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said in a Commons written answer.
The main changes to the rules are:
Giving a formal standing to pre-inquiry meetings so that contentious issues
can be resolved early. Allowing the inspector to set a timetable for the
inquiry in advance. Requiring statements of evidence to be presented and
exchanged before the inquiry.
Allowing the inspector to study long statements before an inquiry with only
summaries read out at proceedings.
Giving inspectors the right to refuse evidence they believe to be irrelevant
or repetitious.
The new rules would apply in England and Wales only. Scotland already has a
'fast tracking' procedure to speed roadbuilding programmes.
'These measures will bring highway inquiry rules into line with other
planning inquiries while stopping deliberate attempts to slow their
progress,' Mr MacGregor said.
'These tactics have in the past led to the waste of time and taxpayers'
money,' he added, saying the new proposals would not diminish objectors'
rights.
Public inquiries form only part of the planning process but they can lead to
substantial delays in roadbuilding. The extension to the M3 motorway at
Twyford Down in Hampshire took 25 years before work started and involved
three public inquiries.
The M11 extension in east London, recently the subject of battles between
police and protestors, also required three public inquiries. The new rules
would not reduce the number of inquiries but should reduce their length.
The British Road Federation welcomed the planned changes but said they would
work only as part of a wider package including steps to cut delays within
the Department of Transport, more generous compensation payments and
increased public involvement at an early stage in roadbuilding.
Mr Richard Diment, director of the federation, said: 'Britain's current
planning laws are a recipe for blight and cannot deliver the quality
transport system our country needs.'

FT  23 FEB 94 / Army to cut 7,000 further posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will today announce up to 7,000 army redundancies in the
latest phase of cuts under the 1990 Options for Change cost-cutting
programme. Most of the job losses will be voluntary but it is expected that
some officers will be made compulsorily redundant.
The announcement is likely to upset rightwing Conservative MPs, who have
argued that military capabilities have already been cut to the bone by
previous rounds of redundancies.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, described the move as 'absolutely
outrageous'. He said: 'Our armed services are so over-stretched that we need
a full defence review at once.'
About 10,000 personnel have already lost their jobs in two previous rounds
of cuts. However the Ministry of Defence is under pressure to meet revised
spending targets agreed in the Budget.
The defence budget of Pounds 23.5bn is about 16 per cent lower in real terms
than in the mid-1980s and a further 12 per cent reduction is planned by
1996/97. The cuts have prompted rising bitterness in the forces, which have
been reduced from 320,000 a decade ago to 270,000.
Last month Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of the air staff,
complained that a 'disreputable campaign' was being waged against the
services.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Train leasing deal faces Treasury obstacles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 500m deal to equip the Northern Line of the London Underground with
100 new trains has fallen foul of Treasury guidelines on leasing
arrangements, Labour said yesterday.
ABB Transportation, the Derby-based manufacturer of rolling stock, has been
negotiating with London Underground for several months to build, maintain
and operate the new trains under a 20-year licensing deal. But it has run
into problems with the Treasury rules.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, condemned the delay in
approving the deal as a further example of the failure of the government's
private-finance initiative: 'The Treasury seems to be inventing problems.'
The problem appears to hinge on a requirement for ABB to assume a greater
commercial risk, possibly with payments relating to revenues earned on the
Northern Line.
The ABB proposals would meet half of the Pounds 1bn costs of modernising
rolling stock, signals and track. The newest rolling stock on the line is 34
years old. The Department of Transport said it was carrying out an urgent
study to see if the proposals met the Treasury guidelines.
News of problems emerged on the same day that Sir Alastair Morton, chairman
of the private finance panel, was explaining in a Mansion House speech to
the City how the initiative was meant to work. The panel was set up by the
chancellor in the autumn to identify promising projects and remove blockages
to implementing them.
Sir Alistair acknowledged that the initiative had become 'diffuse', and that
there were varying levels of enthusiasm in government departments. It would
be 'months rather than weeks' before results could be expected, he added.
However, ABB said it needed a rapid decision if it was to keep open its
production line in Derby. It is making similar trains for the Underground's
Central Line.
London Underground, which has repeatedly complained about a lack of funds,
said it welcomed any financing proposal which would allow it to improve the
quality of service. It hopes for a decision from the government by the
middle of the year.
London First, the business consortium which seeks to promote the capital,
said it was mystified.
'There is a clear need and benefit to London and in commercial terms the
deal ticks all the boxes in the government's private-finance initiative,' it
said.
The Treasury said it could not confirm or deny that problems had arisen over
its leasing guidelines.
The guidelines state that there is little attraction in leasing if it simply
represents a deferred purchase because this could normally be financed more
cheaply - and directly - by the government.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Docklands railway covers new ground: Managers are determined
to avoid the delays that bedevilled the early years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past eight months the automatic, driverless trains of London's
Docklands Light Railway have been shuttling along a new five-mile extension
to the suburb of Beckton. The trains have been operating without passengers
as software and signalling systems controlling the railway have been tested.
Problems in constructing the Beckton extension and installing the systems
have delayed the opening for 18 months.
Mr Malcolm Hutchinson, DLR managing director, is determined to avoid the
breakdowns and delays which followed the opening of the first 7 1/2 miles of
the railway in 1987.
It is important that the DLR gets this launch right. It has never really
recovered from the poor reputation it acquired in its early years. This was
partly because it was designed when Docklands was still planned as an area
of housing and light industry and before the building of Canary Wharf turned
it into a high-rise office centre.
The Beckton extension will bring a large part of east London within easy
reach of the line and take the railway within a few hundred yards of the
City airport.
In a hangover from the poor transport planning which has bedevilled
Docklands development, there will still be no station in the airport
terminal.
The Beckton extension, which starts east from Poplar, is only one of several
developments under way. Mr Hutchinson and his team of managers, recruited in
November 1991 from the procurement department of the Ministry of Defence,
believe they will bring about a rehabilitation of the railway's image and a
period of rapid expansion. The second significant improvement should come in
the summer when painstaking work to modernise signalling will be completed
and the railway will be open in the evenings and at weekends, making it much
more attractive to local workers and accessible for tourists.
Original signalling is being replaced with a system incorporating improved
safety systems and allowing greater flexibility in train timetables.
By the end of this year the DLR expects to choose a private consortium to
carry out a Pounds 100m extension of the railway across the Thames.
This will take it south into Greenwich and Lewisham, more than doubling
potential revenues and traffic volumes. At present the DLR costs Pounds 20m
a year to run but takes only Pounds 4m in ticket revenues.
Once the line is completed, the DLR is expected to lease it from the
consortium for between 15 and 20 years before assuming final ownership.
Original plans were for five new stations south of the river and for the
present Island Gardens terminus on the north bank to be moved underground.
But this would have pushed up costs to nearly Pounds 150m and made the
project uneconomic. So the present plan to resite Island Gardens below
ground will be dropped and proposals to build the Cutty Sark station in
Greenwich town centre will be shelved, although this decision has prompted
criticism that the line would then bypass the most attractive location for
travellers.
Hopes of a sustained recovery of the UK economy and indications that the
Canary Wharf development is starting to attract more tenants make
improvements to the DLR particularly timely.
The Lewisham spur is due to be completed by 1997, the year before the Pounds
1.9bn Jubilee Line extension provides a direct underground link between
Docklands and the West End of London. The Jubilee Line extension will
increase the attractions of Docklands for office developers, but will at the
same time steal many of the DLR's customers who now come out from the City.
An interchange station between the two lines will be built at Canary Wharf.
The Lewisham line, it is hoped, will provide a new source of income and
narrow the gap between operating costs and ticket revenues.
But by the time this happens, the DLR could well be in preparation for
private ownership.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Minister says laws hamper local authority changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reshuffles of responsibility in the two-tier local government system in
rural England are not possible because they are not allowed by legislation,
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said yesterday.
He told a conference of the Association of District Councils: 'Whatever the
intellectual arguments which say we should reduce the county councils to a
more genuine strategic authority and devolve down to the districts, that
option is not open to us.'
Mr Peter Johnson of Fylde Borough Council in Lancashire said his council had
already agreed to merge with a neighbouring authority, but members now
wondered whether they had 'surrendered the borough too soon'. He said there
was 'powerful lobbying' to redistribute functions between counties and
districts, but leave boundaries undisturbed.
Mr Curry said the government still favoured all-purpose unitary authorities,
combining all the functions now done by counties and districts despite last
month's High Court ruling that this preference could not be written into the
government's guidance to the commission.
Mr Curry said districts must agree on mergers, but should think more about
how to provide low-profile services such as archive services and planning
instead of arguing about drawing boundaries.
He said that if new unitary authorities could not reach voluntary
arrangements on joint planning the alternative would be voluntary agreements
'where my department at the end of the day stands behind to make sure
there's no failure in delivery - it would be a sort of guided voluntary
activity'.
Professor Michael Clarke of Birmingham University, a former chief executive
of the Local Government Management Board, told the conference there was a
danger that chances to decide on basic issues for the future of local
government could be missed.
New unitary authorities would be 'totally new animals' and not a
continuation of old councils, he said.
One chief executive of a district council planned that the education
department, now run by the county, would become a division of the district's
leisure department. The leader of another district had decided that social
services, also a county task, should be a division of the district housing
department, Prof Clarke said.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Elizabeth David's kitchen items sold
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pine kitchen table on which Elizabeth David prepared recipes for cookery
books that changed the eating habits of a generation sold for Pounds 1,100
at Phillips in Bayswater yesterday to Pru Leith, the restaurateur.
Like most of the 177 lots taken from the kitchen of Elizabeth David, who
died in 1992, it went far ahead of its pre-sale estimate. The auction
brought in Pounds 49,000 compared with a Pounds 20,000 forecast. More than
1,000 people crowded the small saleroom. David is credited with introducing
the taste for Mediterranean flavours to post-war Britain.
A copper frying pan made Pounds 368 and an earthenware pot containing a
selection of wooden spoons and forks Pounds 460.
A group of seven of Elizabeth David's cookery books, one with handwritten
recipes, made Pounds 520 (top estimate Pounds 120). Two albums containing
cards, scraps and cuttings, with some hand-coloured sketches by John Minton,
the artist and illustrator of her books, realised Pounds 483.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Drugs policy 'watered down'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's policy on illegal drugs was under attack yesterday after
leaked papers showed it had altered a report calling for a coherent approach
to drug misuse.
Two versions of a report by the Department of Health show the original paper
containing criticism of the government's failure to provide a co-ordinated
drugs policy.
In the final version the title have been changed, key texts calling for a
new partnership to tackle the problem in local communities have been watered
down, and some chapters have been omitted.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'The first version of the report
that has been with the Department of Health for over a year is strongly
critical of government policy and urges precisely the type of new strategy
to fight drug misuse that Labour proposes.'
Mr Blair said: 'These two versions are drastically different with every sign
that hard-hitting recommendations have been deliberately watered down.'
The government yesterday said the report had been changed because the
management consultants, Roger Howard Associates, who had been commissioned
to write the report had gone 'well beyond their brief'.
Labour is pushing for an amendment to the criminal justice bill to tackle
the link between drug abuse and youth crime.

FT  23 FEB 94 / MPs are told to save Cox apples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisp, sweet and quintessentially English Cox apple is an endangered
species, say apple growers who went to the Commons yesterday demanding
action to save it.
About 200 growers lobbied MPs and placed a symbolic 'lost orchard' in
Abingdon Gardens, the area of lawn opposite the Commons.
They say the Cox is being threatened by an influx of foreign apples from
low-cost producers such as Chile and South Africa.
This is being compounded by a surplus of about 1m tonnes of apples in the
European Union.
As a result, retail prices are at the same level in real terms as 10 years
ago, and UK growers last year covered only half their cost of production.
'The growers aren't getting enough money from their apples to replant their
orchards,' said a spokeswoman.
'Unless they invest in new trees, they're going to end up with nothing left
at all.'
The English Cox Apple Growers, grouping 780 producers, want Britain to
ensure fair trade is enforced through the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, and that UK producers are given the same financial support as
continental producers.
They are also calling for itemised till receipts in supermarkets.
This would highlight British produce to encourage consumers to buy Cox.

FT  23 FEB 94 / MGN stands firm on bid: O'Reilly moves to become largest
shareholder in Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mirror Group Newspapers consortium which is bidding for control of The
Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers said yesterday it would
press ahead even though Irish publisher Mr Tony O'Reilly had moved to lift
his stake to 29.99 per cent.
Mr O'Reilly's company Independent Newspapers of Ireland - which acquired
24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the UK newspapers, earlier
this month - said yesterday it had agreed to purchase a further 5 per cent
for 350p per share, conditional on approval from the Department of Trade and
Industry. The DTI must approve any increase above 25 per cent on competition
grounds.
If approved, the deal will take Mr O'Reilly's holding to just below the
level that would trigger a full bid for the company, and make him the
largest single shareholder. That will increase the pressure on the MGN-led
consortium, whose members include Newspaper Publishing's two largest
existing shareholders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and a
group of founders of the newspapers, to make a deal with Mr O'Reilly.
The independent directors of Newspaper Publishing are meeting today and are
expected to make an announcement about the consortium's offer, which was
raised on Sunday from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a mixture of cash and MGN
shares. It values the company at Pounds 73.65m.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, held back on Monday from recommending the bid
to shareholders until he had further details - which were provided
yesterday.
The MGN consortium, which owns more than 47 per cent of Newspaper
Publishing, made no official reaction to Mr O'Reilly's move yesterday. But
members are thought to be strongly opposed to any deal with the Irish
publisher, who has twice sought to thwart their plans.
Advisers to the consortium denied claims that Mr O'Reilly's move would make
it difficult to structure a deal satisfactory to all its members.
Members have agreed that MGN would take at least 25 per cent of Newspaper
Publishing's equity. But it would hold some voting shares in trust for the
continental European shareholders, giving them more than 50 per cent of the
voting.
The Irish group said yesterday that it was keeping all options open and had
not ruled out a full bid for Newspaper Publishing. But it stressed that Mr
O'Reilly's aim was to be 'a constructive, significant, minority
shareholder'.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Lobbyists cool to self-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five of the largest lobbying firms have teamed up to produce proposals for a
self-regulating regime for the industry. But they told MPs yesterday that
they would rather be regulated by parliament.
Mr Michael Burrell, managing director of Westminster Strategy, told MPs on
the committee of members' interests that the suggestions were only the
second-best approach.
Self-regulation could lead to a perception that the industry was acting as
judge and jury, he said.
He added that a system similar to the register of members' interests, which
records pecuniary interests and other material benefits received by MPs,
would 'command more respect' than anything the industry could put forward.
The five firms - Westminster Strategy, European Political Consultancy Group,
GJW Government Relations, Ian Greer Associates and The Public Policy Unit -
are proposing to set up a Association of Political Consultants. The five
account for at least Pounds 10m of turnover between them.
This body would propose a code of professional practice and impose a number
of ethical duties on its members. It would be responsible for disciplining
its members should the code of practice be breached.
It would also maintain a voluntary register of professional lobbyists. The
firms said: 'We believe that the voluntary principle would avoid the
administrative complications associated with such a wide remit while
highlighting those who refuse to register.'
Referring to alternative proposals under which the Public Relations
Consultants Association would administer a registration system and code of
conduct for lobbyists, the firms said it would be 'inappropriate' for a body
representing the public relations industry to regulate professional
lobbyists.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, has said a voluntary code of
registration would be preferable to a register that was imposed.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Lords push ministers into courts bill review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night bowed to pressure in the Lords for a review of
plans for a shake-up of the administration of magistrates' courts.
The concession followed further attacks by peers of all parties on the
troubled police and magistrates courts bill - a key element of Mr John
Major's back to basics campaign.
Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Chancellor, announced the review after Lord
Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, joined Conservative backbench
attacks on the bill.
Lord Taylor said that government plans to appoint legally qualified chief
justices' clerks to supervise magistrates' clerks posed a 'real danger' to
the courts.
He said the proposals would blur the distinction between magistrates'
clerks' roles as administrators, and their position as legal advisers to
magistrates.
'There is a risk that volume throughput and economy may triumph over the
interests of justice,' he said. The issue was 'not only fundamental to this
bill, but fundamental to the administration of justice in this country'.
He was supported by Lord Donaldson, a former Master of the Rolls, who told
the Lords: 'We have to defend judicial independence at every stage. A stand
has to be taken.'
Lord Mackay refused to accept a series of amendments entrenching the
separation of the administrative and advisory roles of chief justices'
clerks.
The amendments were withdrawn after he said he would 'consider carefully'
the demands for changes. 'I believe that this issue is one which does merit
going over more than once,' he said.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, Labour's chief spokesman on the bill, said the
government had made 'a tactical withdrawal' in the face of 'great pressure'
from peers on all sides.
The government is expected to face more criticism next week, when the bill
returns to the Lords for further detailed committee-stage debate.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has yet to decide whether to make
further concessions on the contentious issue of government appointments to
police authorities.
An earlier round of concessions was welcomed by the bill's chief critic,
Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime minister, but withdrawn after a
hostile response from other Conservative peers.
The government suffered a defeat on a separate issue earlier this week when
peers rejected plans to tighten police disciplinary procedures.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Tory warns PM of worries on Rover sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government faced further criticism yesterday over the sale of Rover to
BMW as a ministerial aide joined backbenchers in voicing his concern over
the deal.
Mr Tim Devlin, parliamentary private secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, yesterday took the unusual step of asking the prime
minister about the possible risk, sparked by the BMW takeover, to further
Japanese investment in Britain.
At question time in the Commons, he asked Mr John Major: 'With regard to the
comments of the chairman of Honda, reported in today's newspapers - that the
British are no longer serious about manufacturing - will you take steps to
reassure the heads of Japanese businesses that Britain's future does lie
with manufacturing, and we are serious about producing cars, fridges and
other solid goods?'
Mr Major said that Honda had confirmed its intention to develop Swindon as a
centre of manufacturing excellence and to continue helping improve the
performance of UK component suppliers. There was no doubt about the
government's position in believing that manufacturing industry was important
and required support.
Mr Devlin said later: 'I remain deeply worried about letting a strategic
industry pass into foreign hands and fear that the sale could be seen by
other Japanese companies as a message that you cannot rely on Britain.'
A significant number of Tory backbenchers share Mr Devlin's concern. Sir
Teddy Taylor has already asked for the government to make a statement to
reassure other Japanese companies investing in the UK.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, dismissed suggestions
that Honda's decision to sever links with Rover could signal that future
Japanese investment in Britain was at risk.
Mr Heseltine said the Honda move to end its financial relationship with the
British company in the wake of the Pounds 800m sale to BMW was a decision
'to disengage in terms of shared ownership and not to remove the commitment
of investment through Britain in the European Community'.
'The case for Japanese investment in the UK is a very powerful one,' he
added. 'Something like 40 per cent of all investment into the EC from Japan
comes to the UK.'

FT  23 FEB 94 / Women priests win final ratification from synod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England will have women priests from next month following
final approval of legislation by its general synod yesterday.
More than 1,000 women deacons are likely to seek ordination to the
priesthood during the coming year now the final legislative hurdle has been
overcome. The first ordinations will take place in Bristol cathedral on
March 12.
Yesterday's decision by the synod concluded a legislative process that has
been in progress for more than five years. Some male clergy and lay people
are leaving the church over the decision.
After the synod's move Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, urged all
members of the church to unite in proclaiming the gospel 'to a world in
need.' He recognised that some who were opposed to the legislation would
regard the decision with regret. 'To many more, this is a moment for
rejoicing in the confident expectation of the rich and diverse gifts women
will bring to the priestly ministry.'
Several other provinces of the worldwide Anglican communion, including the
Church of Ireland, already have women priests.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Scott challenges security moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE legal position of ministers who signed public interest immunity
certificates in the Matrix Churchill trial was challenged yesterday by Lord
Justice Scott.
The judge heading the arms-for-Iraq inquiry told Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, that disclosure of many of the Whitehall documents which PII
certificates were intended to protect from public scrutiny would have had
only a trivial impact on the efficient functioning of government.
Yesterday Mr Rifkind justified his decision to sign a PII certificate
because of a 'principle of confidentiality' which was 'applied by successive
governments for generations'.
Mr Rifkind, a lawyer, told the Scott inquiry: 'There have been some wild
allegations made (against the government) . . . I consider it extremely
offensive to suggest that any minister knowingly acted against the interests
of justice.'
Documents made available to the inquiry show that, after the collapse of the
Matrix Churchill trial, Ministry of Defence officials thought that the
system of PII certificates could be 'deficient'. They suggested that the use
of the certificates should be more restricted and not extend to a blanket
curb on confidential Whitehall documents.
Although the suggestion was not taken up by ministers Lord Justice Scott
indicated yesterday that he considered a reform of the system to be
necessary. He said: 'Why is it necessary to have a system that operates to
allow government not to disclose documents which are not damaging to the
public interest?'
Mr Rifkind agreed that disclosure of documents showing officials
implementing established government policy 'could not possibly' have a
detrimental effect on the public interest.
Mr Rifkind said he was duty-bound to rely on the 'principle of
confidentiality' and sign the PII certificate.
The inquiry also heard yesterday that Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for
defence procurement, had desisted from presenting a PII certificate at the
Matrix Churchill trial because of a potential 'conflict of interest' between
his role as minister and his past involvement as a non-executive director of
the British Manufacture and Research Company which was linked to the Iraqi
supergun affair.

The government's policy on drug misuse was under attack yesterday after
leaked papers showed it had altered a report calling for a coherent approach
to the problem.
Two versions of a report by the Department of Health show the original paper
containing criticism of the government's failure to provide a co-ordinated
drugs policy. In the final version the title has been changed, important
passages calling for a new partnership to tackle the problem in local
communities have been watered down and some chapters omitted.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'These two versions are
drastically different with every sign that hard-hitting recommendations have
been deliberately watered down.'

The only representative of a local authority on the Funding Agency for

'flagship' borough of Wandsworth.
Members also include two directors of the Thatcherite Centre for Policy

FT  23 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein to put blame on London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, will seek this weekend to blame
the British government for lack of progress on the Northern Ireland peace
initiative.
Officials said yesterday that a 'full debate' was anticipated on the peace
process at the party conference, to be held in Dublin, and a definitive Sinn
Fein response to the Downing Street declaration could not be ruled out -
although it was 'unlikely in current circumstances'.
The party's national executive has put forward an emergency motion welcoming
the Irish government's approach to the Downing Street declaration and 'its
positive and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification'.
It calls on the British government 'to join the ranks of the persuaders' and
reiterates Sinn Fein's demand for British clarification of the peace
process. A Sinn Fein official said this would require face-to-face talks and
for the British government to say whether it was considering an eventual
withdrawal from Northern Ireland.
Mr Danny Morrison, a senior IRA prisoner in the Maze prison in Northern
Ireland, said that, if the British became 'persuaders' of unionists in the
province 'to accept reconciliation with the rest of the Irish people,' this
would result in a rethinking of the Republican movement's strategy.
Other important issues to be debated at the conference are policy papers on
the European Union and the economic effects of a united Ireland.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Major urges US to bar Adams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will use his visit to the US next week to urge President Bill
Clinton to reject any new request from Mr Gerry Adams to visit the US unless
the Sinn Fein president renounces the use of violence by the IRA.
Amid signs that Mr Clinton is reluctant to allow Mr Adams a repeat of his
public relations triumph in New York earlier this month, British officials
said Mr Major would stress the potential damage to the UK-Irish peace
initiative.
After his talks last weekend with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, Mr Major will stress that there are no differences between the
approach of London and Dublin in efforts to secure a settlement in Northern
Ireland.
The officials said Mr Major would emphasise that this approach - and the
resultant pressure on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce violence - would be
undermined if Mr Adams were again given permission to visit the US.
It is understood that Washington has offered private assurances to Downing
Street that the differences over Mr Adams' visit do not represent a
fundamental shift in US policy. That view has been echoed by US officials
who acknowledged that the failure of Mr Adams to embrace December's
Anglo-Irish declaration during his New York trip caused considerable
disappointment in the White House.
Officials are less confident, however, that Mr Major and Mr Clinton will
find it as easy to smooth transatlantic frictions over the west's approach
to the Bosnian war. In spite of the success of the Nato initiative to lift
the siege of Sarajevo, officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe there
is still a considerable risk of further disputes over the war.
Britain's demand that the US commit ground troops to the UN operation in
Bosnia has been met with a flat rejection in Washington. For its part the
London government remains unconvinced that the Clinton administration is
ready to put pressure on the Bosnian government to reach a settlement with
the Serbs.
US officials said the Bosnian issue had become a test of Nato's new role
after the end of the cold war, raising fears that further disputes could
undermine Washington's long-term commitment to European security.
Mr Major hopes that the form of his visit next week - he will stay overnight
at the White House - will put to rest recent talk of a permanent Anglo-US
rift.

service agents, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told the Commons
yesterday.
In an unprecedented departure from normal practice, he cited the incident as
an example of the continuing importance of MI6, the secret intelligence
service. With MI5, the home security service, and the government
communications centre GCHQ it is to be made more accountable to parliament
by the intelligence services bill.
Mr Hurd said the assassination plot was uncovered during the Gulf war when
British intelligence agencies gained access to premises occupied by a
terrorist in a developing country. An operation in a west European country
had led directly to the saving of the ambassador's life.
Mr Hurd also said that information gathered by the security services had
resulted in a top company in one of Britain's European neighbours not
proceeding with a construction contract in a developing country. He said:
'Our agency was able to demonstrate from its intelligence that the proposed
facilities were intended for the production of weapons of mass destruction.'
Mr Hurd stressed that a new committee of six parliamentarians to be
appointed by the prime minister would not deal with operational activities.
Its task would be to scrutinise the administration, policy and expenditure
of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.
Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, welcomed the bill in principle
but called for a more dominant role for parliament in the new committee. He
suggested that it have at least nine members.
Mr Tom King, the former Conservative defence secretary, highlighted the
important role being played by the intelligence services in preventing
illicit deals in arms emanating from the former Soviet Union.
The bill, already approved by the Lords, was given an unopposed second
reading.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Hurd admits regrets over Pergau dam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday gave the first clear
admission that the government had regretted its handling of a Pounds 300m
aid grant for Malaysia's Pergau dam project by admitting that Whitehall
officials had conducted an internal inquiry into the affair.
In a written memorandum to a group of MPs yesterday, Mr Hurd said that the
Overseas Development Administration had instigated 'a review of the lessons
to be learned from Pergau'.
Mr Hurd said: 'The objective was to avoid a repeat of the way in which key
stages in the project approval process were handled.'
The inquiry was completed in August 1991, only one month after the ODA had
given the final go-ahead for the first tranche of aid to be forwarded to
Malaysia. It proposed sweeping changes to the Britain's aid-and-trade (ATP)
provision, which supports development projects of value to UK industry.
Mr Hurd's memorandum was sent to members of the Commons foreign affairs
committee. They will cross-examine him next week about the Pergau project,
which government auditors have condemned as 'a very bad buy'. The memorandum
repeated the government's claim that there was no linkage between the aid
package and a Pounds 1bn deal to buy British defence equipment which was
signed at the same time. A formal connection would have broken long-standing
government guidelines on aid provision.
However, a Foreign Office paper accompanying Mr Hurd's testimony reveals
that - shortly before the arms deal was finalised in September 1988 -
Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, sent the Malaysians a letter
confirming that aid for civil projects would continue.
The letter, dated August 8, was sent to Dr Mahathir, the Malaysian prime
minister, and followed similar assurances made two months earlier by the
British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur.
In his memo Mr Hurd said 'a number of important lessons were learned from
the Pergau review' and incorporated in changes made to the ATP programme
last year. These included:
Project appraisals should be as comprehensive as possible and 'involve
government-to-government dealing on all important issues like price.' One of
the criticisms made by ODA officials in 1988 was that they had been left
with too little time to make a proper project appraisal.
Any change to the basis of an ATP offer should lead to an immediate review
of the project, and the recipient government should be informed of that
review. Last year, the National Audit Office noted that the government had
repeatedly renewed its offer of aid to Malaysia, in spite of significant
increases in the project's cost.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Standard Life likely to accept new watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, one of the UK's leading insurers, is almost certain to sign
up for the proposed new financial services watchdog in spite of its earlier
preference for full statutory regulation.
Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director and a former board member of the
proposed Personal Investment Authority, said there was only 'an outside
chance' that the company would reject the PIA and insist on being regulated
directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
He resigned as a PIA director in January over the decision that people
working in the financial services industry should not make up a majority of
the board, but yesterday
highlighted the Treasury's commitment that the PIA should come into
existence.
'We will make the best of life the way it is,' he said. 'We will certainly
not be making futile gestures.'
Mr Stretton added that the only basis on which Standard Life would seek to
be SIB-regulated was if it was clear that the PIA faced 'masses of
opposition and a community of view (in the industry) about what should
happen'.
While his comments will be welcomed by the PIA, his view that the
establishment of the new regulator did not mean the end of the argument
about the direction of regulation is likely to be less welcome.
He also highlighted the PIA's costs - involving 18 per cent fee increases -
and its streamlined committee structure, which omits a general 'practitioner
panel', as two elements likely to cause concern.
There were signs of more vigorous opposition to the PIA from the National
Federation of Independent Financial Advisers which intends today to compare
the PIA prospectus with its own charter of seven consumers' rights. It is
already clear that the prospectus will not measure up in all respects.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Imro to publicise action against member firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has decided
to end its policy of keeping disciplinary actions against its members
secret.
Mr Philip Thorpe, chief executive, said that Imro had made the decision late
last year as part of a review of its disciplinary procedures.
Previously it recorded disciplinary actions in a 'members' register' and
sought no publicity. Investors would not learn of any disciplinary action
unless they consulted the register.
Imro yesterday announced disciplinary proceedings against four of its
members, two of which relate to breaches of the rules nearly four years ago.
One of these was against the related firms Wright Seligman and Co and Wright
Seligman Fund Managers, which are both in liquidation. Between February 8
1991 and May 22 1991 Wright Seligman and Co asked the independent custodian
to release to it customer share certificates without customer permission.
Between August 3 1990 and May 22 1991 it failed to prevent transactions by
its officers or employees which involved conflicts of interest.
Imro succeeded in having all assets returned to clients by July 1992 but
could not complete disciplinary proceedings against the firm until all
appeals were exhausted in January this year. Wright Seligman has been
ordered to pay costs of Pounds 21,000 which would have been greater had the
firm's financial position been stronger.
Imro also terminated the membership of a fund management subsidiary of
British and Commonwealth Group, which had traded under the name of RJ Shrubb
and Co. Imro found that investors' money had, without authorisation, been
deposited with British and Commonwealth Merchant Bank and that about Pounds
250,000 of interest from those deposits had been retained by the fund
management company.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Major set to ask Clinton for block on Adams visits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will next week urge President Bill Clinton to reject any new
request from Mr Gerry Adams to visit the US unless the Sinn Fein president
renounces the use of violence by the IRA.
Amid signs that Mr Clinton would be reluctant to allow Mr Adams a repeat of
his public relations triumph in New York earlier this month, British
officials said Mr Major would stress the potential damage to the UK-Irish
peace initiative.
After his talks last weekend with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, Mr Major would stress that there were no differences between the
approach of London and Dublin in efforts to secure a settlement in Northern
Ireland.
The officials said Mr Major would emphasise that this approach - and the
resultant pressure on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce violence - would be
undermined if Mr Adams were again given permission to visit the US.
The prime minister would give the same message in talks with Mr Tom Foley,
speaker of the House of Representatives, and other senior figures.
It is understood that the Washington administration has offered private
assurances to Downing Street that the differences over Mr Adams' visit do
not represent a fundamental shift in US policy.
That view has been echoed by US officials who acknowledged that the failure
of Mr Adams to embrace December's Anglo-Irish declaration during his New
York trip caused considerable disappointment in the White House.
Officials are less confident, however, that Mr Major and Mr Clinton will
find it as easy to smooth transatlantic frictions over the west's approach
to the Bosnian war.
In spite of the success of the Nato initiative to lift the siege of
Sarajevo, officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe there is still a
considerable risk of further disputes over the war in the former Yugoslav
province.
Britain's demand that the US commit ground troops to the UN operation in
Bosnia has been met with a flat rejection and some irritation in Washington.
For its part the London government remains unconvinced that the Clinton
administration is ready to put pressure on the Bosnian government to reach a
settlement with the Serbs.
US officials said the Bosnian issue had become a test of Nato's new role
after the end of the cold war, raising fears that further disputes could
undermine Washington's long-term commitment to European security.
Mr Major hopes that the form of his visit next week - he will stay overnight
at the White House after lengthy talks with President Clinton in Pittsburgh
 -will at least put to rest recent talk of a permanent Anglo-US rift.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Life policies head complaints league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life assurance was the biggest source of complaints dealt with by the
insurance ombudsman last year with the most common allegations being
maladministration, poor communication and mis-selling.
About 39 per cent of life assurance complaints were upheld compared with 29
per cent for general insurance. 'The difference does perhaps underline some
of the difficulties involved in satisfactory selling of investment products
to the public,' said Mr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, in his annual report.
Responsibility for handling many life assurance complaints will pass to the
ombudsman for the new Personal Investment Authority later this year. But the
maximum compulsory award in the PIA scheme will be Pounds 50,000, whereas
the insurance ombudsman can oblige companies to pay up to Pounds 100,000.
Complaints about home income plans sold in the 1980s, when many elderly
people were encouraged to take the risky step of mortgaging their homes and
investing the proceeds to provide an income, form a large part of the
current workload.
Companies were required to pay out Pounds 7.4m last year as a result of the
ombudsman's adjudications. The largest single payment was Pounds 230,000 and
the smallest Pounds 3.88.

Round start

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration, influential members of Congress and the US
business community yesterday pushed for swift passage of Uruguay Round
legislation, paving the way for implementation of new world trading rules
six months earlier than agreed in Geneva last December.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, indicated that the US would
be willing to move forward the starting date to January 1 1995. All that
stood in the way, he said, was agreement by Japan, which must call a special
session of the Diet (parliament).
Early implementation of the Round has been sought by Mr Peter Sutherland,
the Gatt director-general. The Round took three years longer than expected
to conclude, and numerous issues - environment and competitions policies
among them - await the attention of Gatt members.
Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman of Texas Instruments, ann-ounced formation of a
coalition, representing 200,000 companies, called Alliance for Gatt Now.
Passing Gatt implementing legislation must be 'a top priority this year', he
said.
Mr Kantor said the administration would begin a big drive on the legislation
after the Gatt deal is signed on April 15 in Morocco.
Democratic and Republican members of the House ways and means committee,
which has final jurisdiction over the legislation, pledged support, with one
Republican member, Mr Bill Thomas, vowing that a majority of his party would
support passage.
Opposition in the business community, expected by some members of Congress,
has yet to surface. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association had
threatened to oppose a Gatt deal without improvements in proposed rules
governing patents. That did not happen, but Mr Gerald Mossinghoff, president
of the PMA, appeared before the House trade subcommittee in support of the
pact, apparently persuaded by agreement among many countries to eliminate
pharmaceutical import duties.
PMA support was contingent on the US 'vigorously' pursuing unilaterally
improvements in intellectual property protection in 'patent-infringing
countries during the unduly long and discriminatory implement period for
pharmaceutical patent protection.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US trade officials have approached the European Commission with fresh
suggestions for a joint European-US initiative to persuade Japan to open up
its markets.
EU officials have responded cautiously, with Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade
commissioner, stressing that he does not wish to emulate the US's combative
approach towards the Japan.
But as EU officials grow concerned about the implications of the US-Japanese
trade row for the Gatt deal, as well as Europe's own mounting trade deficit
with Japan, the concept of a new trilateral approach has received serious
consideration in the commission.
'It may well be the right course now is to trilateralise the whole process,'
commented Sir Leon at the end of last week, as EU and US officials held
working meetings to discuss the matter.
The 'trilateral' concept, aired by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, in Brussels last month, has been emerging since the
Japanese-US trade talks began to falter, commission officials say. 'When it
was clear the US-Japanese talks started to break down we were approached by
the Americans saying can you help us,' explains one commission official, who
stresses that so far the discussions remain exploratory.
But although in public EU officials insist the main focus remains the Gatt
meeting in Marrakesh, with the US-Japanese trade row gathering pace, US
pressure over the issue has stepped up - leaving the commission in an
uncertain position.
On the one hand, commission officials say the EU has little intention of
abandoning its own, more collaborative, approach towards Japan. This
involves a combination of diplomatic pressure and a trade assessment
mechanism to open Japanese markets. Although Sir Leon says he would favour
some form of macro-economic framework agreement for Japanese-EU trade, he
opposes US suggestions of specific trade targets or a quota system.
But on the other hand, the EU's continued trade deficit - some Ecu26bn
(Pounds 19.65bn) last year - has left many in the commission suspecting that
new tactics may be needed. And although the lack of individual economic
muscle among the separate member states means Europe has little chance of
emulating the US strong-arm tactics, Europe officials remain reluctant to
eschew any benefits that could come from the US's approach.
'If market opening was working, the EU would want to share in that,' says
one diplomat in Brussels, who says many of the apparent difference between
the EU and US over the concept of trade quotas remained largely semantic,
particularly in the greyer area of market 'indicators'.
But with the US and EU apparently holding different ideas of what a
'trilateral' initiative might entail, few expect any joint initiative to
emerge before the Marrakesh meeting. Meanwhile, the Japanese show no signs
of wishing to bow to any new joint pressure, however informal. Mr Tetsuo
Yakashita, first secretary of the Japanese delegation in Brussels, says:
'Sir Leon has talked about this, but there is nothing very concrete yet.'

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US said yesterday it hoped to submit by the end of this week its final
tariff schedule under the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
Washington's delay in producing its schedule following a row with Japan over
tariff concessions has held up other countries' submissions and threatened
the tight timetable for checking and printing schedules before ministers
meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round accords.
Failure of the US and its Quad partners - the European Union, Japan and
Canada - to submit tariff schedules by the agreed February 15 deadline came
in for strong criticism at an emergency session of top trade negotiators in
Geneva yesterday.
Shortly before that deadline, the Quad group agreed they would submit their
schedules together, after cross-checking to ensure they reflected agreed
concessions.
Tokyo has threatened retaliation and accused the US of bad faith after
Washington said it was withdrawing offers on wood, white spirits and some
industrial electronics goods made last December, on the grounds that Japan
had failed to match these with tariff concessions of its own.
The US action has sown confusion among trading partners who fear the ripple
effects if other nations too decide to adjust their tariff offers. The EU,
Japan and Canada have said they are waiting for the US schedule before
deciding whether to retract concessions.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, is believed to have said
yesterday that tariff offers made in December could not be withdrawn, only
improved upon. US officials told the meeting that the delay on Washington's
part was due to 'technical problems' and the schedule, covering thousands of
items, would be in 'hopefully by the end of the week'.

China and the US yesterday concluded two days of what officials described as
serious discussions on Beijing's application to rejoin the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
But China, according to the officials, still has a 'lot of things to do'
before satisfying requirements to rejoin Gatt, including further progress in
removing tariff and non-tariff barriers.
The two sides were preparing for the 16th session of the Gatt working party
due to reconvene in Geneva next month. This will be the working party's
first meeting since the end of the Uruguay Round late last year.
China has made no secret of its wish to be a founding member of the World
Trade Organisation, due to come into being in 1995 as a successor to Gatt.
Western countries are pushing China to liberalise its markets, scrap trade
curbs, take further steps to make its currency convertible and deal with
issues such as intellectual property right infringement.

A leading member of Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday advocated the
adoption of informal 'effort indicators' as a part of Japan's market opening
measures.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of the Japan Renewal Party and backroom
mastermind of the coalition, said he opposed managed trade but supported the
adoption of voluntary trade targets which Japan will make every effort to
achieve, but would not be held to account if not met.
The calls come after US threats to impose trade sanctions following the
breakdown of US-Japan bilateral framework talks. The failure was blamed on
Japan's staunch opposition to US demands for numerical targets on foreign
market share.
Mr Ozawa's comments spurred expectations on the foreign exchange market of a
compromise over trade between the US and Japan, pushing the yen below the
Y106 level for the first time in a week before closing down Y0.72 at Y105.95
to the dollar. The Japanese currency soared following the collapse of talks
on speculation that the US would try to 'talk up' the yen to curb Japan's
mounting surplus.

The European culture com-missioner yesterday called for an end to the system
that has allowed big Hollywood studios to pool their resources to distribute

Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro said he would propose that the Brussels Commission
terminate the current system, which has granted the distributors exemption
from EU competition rules during the past five years.
'What I want in this expanding market is more room for European works and
fairer distribution,' said Mr Pinheiro. He said that with 80 per cent of
distribution controlled by Univeral International Pictures - which
distributes films for Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and MCA - US film
producers had a near monopoly.
Any attempt to weaken the power of US film producers in Europe is likely to
be welcomed by many EU member states, particularly France, which campaigned
to defend its film industry against Hollywood during the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade talks last year. The audiovisual sector was excluded
from the provisions of the Uruguay Round.
Commission officials said Mr Pinheiro's demand had strong support within
much of the Commission, but stressed that the decision now lay with the
competition directorate, which had not yet reached a final position.
The competition directorate is conducting an investigation, and Mr Karel Van
Miert, EU competition commissioner, is due to decide soon whether to
recommend that the Commission renew the exemption for the US film producers.
In November the European parliament demanded that UIP's exemption lapse,
claiming it had damaged the European film industry. UIP said then that the
parliament sought to 'attribute unwarranted responsibility to UIP for the
difficulties experienced by certain elements of the industry'.
British film distributors, who command no more than 10 per cent of the
industry, generally welcomed Mr Pinheiro's proposal. Mr Alistair Nicolson of
Mayfair Entertainment, which has distributed The Hour of the Pig, Howards
End and The Crying Game, said: 'Any help we can get from the European
Commission is gratefully received. But if you have films like Jurassic Park,
which UIP did, you cannot fight that. You cannot stop people from going to
Jurassic Park.'
But, Artificial Eye, the company that distributed Farewell My Concubine,
does not believe removing UIP's exemption will help the industry. Mr Robert
Beeson, general manager, said: 'If UIP has the films that everyone wants,
regulation will not change anything, unless the EC wants to interfere with
free trade.'
UIP, meanwhile, strongly denied Mr Pinheiro's charges that it had tied
distribution of hit movies to the sale of rights to less successful films.
'We have not acted illegally and Mr Pinheiro should either present evidence
of his charges or issue an apology,' said Mr Brian Riley, UIP general
counsel.
UIP also disputed Mr Pinheiro's figures. 'UIP held an 18 per cent market
share in Europe in 1992 and has never held anything like an 80 per cent
share.'
UIP says it has applied for an extension of its exemption from
anti-competitiveness rules on the basis that its distribution arrangement
benefits consumers, by reducing costs, and that there have been no material
changes in the market since the exemption was first granted five years ago.
The five-year exemption was granted in 1989 after a seven-year investigation
by the Commission, which said it was not
anti-competitive, UIP said.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Canada to axe bases in budget curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada will close more than a third of its military bases and severely
curtail its CDollars 1.8bn (Pounds 910m) share of the international space
station programme as part of a wide range of spending cuts announced in
yesterday's federal budget.
Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, also ended various corporate and
personal tax breaks with the aim of bringing down the budget deficit from
CDollars 45.7bn (Pounds 23.1bn) in the year to March 31 1994 to CDollars
39.7bn in 1995 and CDollars 32.7bn the following year.
Mr Martin said, however, that the budget was only the first step towards
meeting three challenges. These challenges were a framework for economic
recovery, reform of social security programmes, and the restoration of
'fiscal sanity' to government.
As an initial step towards overhauling the social security system,
unemployment insurance premiums will be rolled back next year to 1993
levels. But benefits will be significantly curtailed.
The projected closure of 21 out of 60 military bases, stations and units is
part of a projected 12 per cent cut in defence spending over the next five
years.
Mr Martin also announced a two-year extension of a civil service pay freeze.
Tax measures included the abolition of a CDollars 100,000 capital gains
exemption, and moves to prevent Canadian-based companies from using foreign
affiliates to avoid paying tax.
Various other measures will be taken to close corporate tax loopholes. Mr
Martin said Canada's foreign aid would be cut by 2 per cent next year and
frozen until 1997.
Grants to business are to be reduced by CDollars 225m a year. By 1997 these
grants will be 10 per cent lower than in the present fiscal year.
The budget projections are based on real growth in gross domestic product of
3 per cent this year and 3.8 per cent in 1995. Real GDP growth for 1993 was
put at 2.5 per cent.
Consumer prices are forecast to edge up by 0.8 per cent in 1994, with
inflation accelerating slightly to 1.3 per cent next year. Last year prices
rose by 1.8 per cent.
Mr Martin said the budget moves set a clear path to achieve the goal of
reducing the budget deficit to 3.0 per cent of gross domestic product in
1996-97. Over the next three years the government plans to cut CDollars 5 in
spending for every CDollars 1 raised in new revenues.

A military tribunal has sentenced nine members of Peru's armed forces to up
to 20 years in prison for their role in the July 1992 'La Cantuta' massacre.
Two majors received the most severe penalties, for commanding the patrol
which abducted and killed nine students and a university professor suspected
of guerrilla activity from La Cantuta university.
Four enlisted men who carried out the killings were sentenced to 15 years in
prison, while a general, a colonel and a captain were sentenced to from one
to five years for their involvement.
For almost a year the case has pitted the military against Peru's congress,
human rights courts and the civilian judiciary.
Two weeks ago, the government pushed through a bill, sending the case for
trial by secret military, rather than civilian, court. The move unleashed a
flood of criticism.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Cable companies told to cut rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Communications Commission yesterday voted to impose another
round of rate cuts on cable television operators after last year's efforts
to curb cable prices backfired in many areas.
The majority of cable companies which do not face competition in their areas
will be required to cut rates by 17 per cent if they exceed benchmarks set
by the FCC.
This reduction is substantially more than the 10 per cent cut ordered by the
FCC last year in its first stab at implementing regulations for a law
controlling cable television prices passed by Congress in 1992.
The new rule adopted yesterday by the three FCC commissioners will also
allow the commission to examine a la carte pricing structures offered by
cable operators to make sure that they are not getting around the
restrictions on pricing by removing channels from their basic packages.
Cable systems which wish to charge more than the benchmarks may submit
detailed data on their costs to the FCC, to be measured against an 11.52 per
cent standard rate of return.
While cable company revenues for regulated services have fallen by 5.9 per
cent under the old rules, according to an FCC study published yesterday,
other studies have shown that prices actually increased for around a third
of cable subscribers, and did not yield the Dollars 1bn savings to consumers
that the FCC had promised.
The 1992 law, the only legislation on which Congress overrode former
President George Bush's veto, came in response to a wave of consumer protest
that cable companies, which in most areas operate as a monopoly, were
abusing their dominant position by raising prices steeply.

FT  23 FEB 94 / The US strikes back: Detroit fights back to regain US market
share - Spurred by Japanese success, the Big Three have returned to
profitability - but the struggle is not over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON, LOUISE KEHOE and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the start of this decade there was no more potent symbol of America's
apparent industrial decline than its car manufacturers, as Japanese rivals
gobbled up an ever increasing share of the US vehicle market. 'Detroit's Big
Three are staring death in the face,' declared one influential business
magazine. Yet far from expiring, Detroit today presents one of the main
examples of a recovery in US industrial competitiveness against Japan and
Europe - though one that requires heavy qualification.
In 1993, for the second year in a row, Japan's share of the US car and light
truck market fell, to 23.1 per cent from 24.3 in 1992 and 25.7 in 1991.
Detroit's Big Three - General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler  - saw their
share rise from 72.2 per cent to 73.9 per cent. And while European and
Japanese manufacturers are losing money, Detroit has returned to
profitability after two years of huge losses. Chrysler, the smallest of the
Big Three, which came close to financial crisis three years ago, is now the
most profitable, on a per-vehicle basis.
The US industry has certainly made great strides in the past few years, but
just as the dire predictions of 1990 exaggerated its weakness, there is now
a danger of over-stating its competitive strengths relative to the Japanese.
First, the restructuring of the industry is far from complete. While
Chrysler and Ford are prospering, General Motors, largest of the three, is
still battling to return its bloated, inefficient North American operations
to profitability.
Second, the turnround is due in no small part to economic shifts that could
prove temporary. The yen has appreciated sharply against the dollar over the
past year, even as Japan has fought recession. Japanese car companies cannot
afford to price their vehicles cheaply in North America and chase market
share. The Big Three's vehicles now cost some Dollars 2,500 (Pounds 1,710)
less than equivalent Japanese models - a huge price advantage.
Third, winning back market share in the domestic market could be the least
of the challenges facing Detroit. It also needs to build up its presence in
the fast-growing Asian market, which is dominated by the Japanese, and ward
off an increasing Japanese threat in Europe.
At least the leaders of the US industry recognise they have no grounds for
complacency. Says Mr Alex Trotman, chairman of Ford: 'We are going to have
to work like mad, get more and more efficient, to survive and prosper in
this global industrial environment.' Such attitudes represent a huge change
from American smugness in the 1970s and early 1980s when Detroit, secure in
its vast domestic market, totally underestimated the threat from Japan.
Needled by inexpensive imports, the Big Three challenged the Japanese to
compete 'fairly' by building plants in the US.
The Japanese did just that, setting up numerous 'transplant' factories in
the 1980s. Their share of the US car market soared from 20 per cent at the
start of the decade to a peak of just over 30 per cent in 1991, thanks to
efficient factories producing vehicles which were keenly priced, with
attractive styling and performance and a reputation for reliability.
Detroit's comeback is due to improvements in each of these areas, thanks to
belated copying of Japanese methods. It also stems from slashing the
encrusted layers of corporate bureaucracy which in the past reduced speed,
flexibility and initiative. Chrysler, for example, completely changed the
way it develops new vehicles, setting up 'platform teams', bringing together
disciplines such as engineering and design to work together, rather than
passing the development process sequentially from one department to another.
It has also set up close links with suppliers, which are brought early into
discussions about new models. As a result, it has sharply cut the time and
cost of bringing cars to market - and created a succession of models which
are among America's hottest new vehicles.
Ford, modelling itself on Toyota, has moved in a similar direction, but GM
is still struggling to rationalise its sprawling product development and
engineering processes, and its relations with suppliers remain poor.
Financial woes also forced Ford and Chrysler to restructure manufacturing
operations in the 1980s. Productivity at many of Ford's assembly operations
is now approaching that of its Japanese rivals, with Chrysler lagging some
way behind and GM far in the rear, according to Harbour and Associates, an
industry consultancy.
At the same time, the Big Three have all managed to narrow the reliability
gap which separated them from the Japanese during the 1980s by concentrating
much more closely on quality control during the manufacturing process.
Japanese vehicles still fill nine of the top 10 spots in a closely-watched
quality survey produced by consultancy JD Power &amp; Associates, but the gap is
now so small that customers are prepared to give much more weight to other
factors, such as styling and price. In styling, Ford and Chrysler are
winning customers with a succession of attractive new models, particularly
in the fastest growing segment of the market, for Jeep-like sports utility
vehicles and family mini-vans, known in Europe as multi-purpose vehicles.
The Japanese and GM have weak positions in these sectors.
As for pricing, some US industry executives suggest Detriot's edge could
prove a long-term phenomenon, not related solely to the recent gyrations of
the yen. Mr Ed Hagenlocker, head of Ford's North American automotive
operations, says Japanese companies have consistently put up their US prices
by around 5 per cent a year over the past decade, irrespective of the value
of the yen, while Detroit's have gone up 3 per cent a year and inflation 4
per cent. This, he says, seems to represent a trend-line, and he wonders if
the Japanese have been 'selling product at less than cost for quite a while'
 -a luxury they certainly cannot afford now.
Whatever the truth, no one is counting the Japanese out. They remain
formidable competitors and have repeatedly demonstrated a remarkable ability
to bounce back from adversity.
But at least Detroit now knows it too has the initiative to stage a
comeback. Mr Wayne Booker, head of Ford's international operations, speaks
for much the industry when he says: 'It's my perception the Japanese are a
force with which we can compete - if we stay on our toes and perform very
efficiently.'

FT  23 FEB 94 / CIA man is held in US 'spy' case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A long-serving CIA employee and his wife have been arrested on charges of
spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia in one of the US's biggest-ever
spy cases, the Justice Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
Held without bail pending further court action were Mr Aldrich Ames, 52,
most recently the chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's
counter-intelligence unit, and his wife, Mrs Maria del Rosario Casas Ames,
41, a US citizen who did not work for the CIA.
Justice Department officials said the couple, arrested separately by the FBI
on Sunday, had been charged with spying for the Soviet Union from 1985 until
its demise in 1991 and then for Russia, in return for more than Dollars 1m
(Pounds 685,000) in pay-offs.
Mr Ames has been employed by the Central Intelligence Agency for 31 years,
the department said.
He served as chief of the Soviet Counter-intelligence Branch from 1983 to
1985. He had previously been a CIA operations agent recruiting Soviet
officials and KGB officers to spy against the Soviet Union, according to
court papers. Since 1969, he had served at CIA posts in Ankara and Mexico
City, as well as doing several stints at the agency's headquarters.
Officials described it as one of the biggest spy cases ever, because of the
extent of the material allegedly passed and the sensitive nature of
compromised national security information.
The arrests capped an investigation that had run for over two years, they
said, apparently triggered by a tip from a KGB defector. No further arrests
were expected.
The two arrests confirmed that the Soviet Union had been able to penetrate
the CIA, planting a mole inside the US spy agency, just as some veteran
intelligence officials had long suspected.
In a brief court hearing in suburban Alexandria, Virginia, a federal
magistrate ordered the couple to be held in jail without bail until another
hearing on Friday.
President Bill Clinton said later yesterday that it was 'a serious case'.
'We will be immediately lodging a protest to the Russian government,' he
said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 18 guerrillas wearing masks, many sporting pistols, sat in the interior
of the baroque cathedral of San Cristobal de Las Casas and introduced
themselves in their native Tzental, Tzotzil, Chol, Tojolabal or accented
Spanish.
The piece of theatre marked the opening of peace talks intended to end the
two-month conflict in Chiapas launched by the Zapatista National Liberation
Army which has left more than 100 dead and 20,000 refugees.
Sandwiched between the guerrillas was Mr Manuel Camacho, former mayor of
Mexico City and now peace commissioner in the impoverished southern state of
Chiapas. He joined hands with some of the guerrillas and raised the Mexican
flag, an act intended to reflect what the two sides had in common.
The rebels described themselves as fully Mexican and from the state of
Chiapas. They said they were part of the Clandestine Revolutionary
Indigenous Committee of the Zapatistas, and as such the supreme leaders of
the rebel force.
Their spokesman was Sub-commander Marcos, who has achieved notoriety as the
only non-Indian among the rebel leaders and their interpreter with the rest
of Mexico. Wearing his black poncho and balaclava, a string of red
cartridges around his shoulder, the sub-commander declared: 'My colleagues
were clear in explaining to the commissioner that they did not come to seek
a pardon, that they do not regret fighting for their rights, but they see
that this could be the moment that in place of speaking with the rifle, the
good men that form our army can speak from their heart.'
Sub-commander Marcos said that the two sides spent practically all the first
day reaching agreement on the agenda of peace negotiations. He said the
rebels would then present their list of demands for local and national
reforms.
Mr Camacho recognised the guerrillas as an entirely Mexican force,
predominantly indigenous and as any army of national liberation. He thus
publicly ridiculed the government's former position that guerrillas were
lawbreakers, led by foreigners, who manipulated their Indian followers.
The show of unity between Mr Camacho and the rebels belies the difficulty of
negotiations ahead. With powerful forces in the state opposed to the
Zapatistas, Mr Camacho will find it difficult to make significant
concessions.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Supreme Court judge rejects death penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun yesterday declared his all-out
opposition to the death penalty, becoming the only one of nine Supreme Court
judges to consider capital punishment unconstitutional in all cases.
'From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of
death,' Mr Blackmun wrote in a dissent to the Supreme Court's denial of an
appeal by a prisoner in Texas scheduled to die by lethal injection today.
'Rather than continue to coddle the court's delusion that the desired level
of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I
feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death
penalty experiment has failed,' he added.
In an opinion backing the court's denial of the appeal, Justice Antonin
Scalia savagely criticised Mr Blackmun's arguments.
'Convictions in opposition to the death penalty are often passionate and
deeply held. That would be no excuse for reading them into a constitution
that does not contain them,' Mr Scalia wrote.
Mr Blackmun's conversion is unlikely to have any immediate practical
consequence on the application of the death penalty in the US, since in most
of the test cases that have come before the Supreme Court in recent years he
had already voted against its use in many specific circumstances.
Along with since-retired Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, the
last members of the court to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances,
and Justice John Paul Stevens, Mr Blackmun voted with the minority in 1987
in McCleskey vs Kemp, in which the court said that clear evidence that the
death penalty was disproportionately applied to blacks was not enough to
overturn a sentence.
He joined the same justices in the dissenting minority in 1989 when the
court upheld the execution of a defendant convicted of a crime committed at
the age of 16, a practice followed by only five other countries, including
Iraq and Iran.
The Supreme Court nullified all death penalty statutes in the US in 1972 on
the grounds that they were arbitrary and irrational, but from 1976 onwards
has progressively permitted wider use of capital punishment under redrafted
laws. Since then, 228 people have been executed, 31 of them last year.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Greenspan soothes market fears: The Fed chief's assurances
on US inflation prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday sought to allay fears
in financial markets that rapid growth posed an immediate threat to US
inflation prospects.
Following the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter
point to 3.25 per cent on February 4, the inflation psychology on Wall
Street has changed.
Instead of interpreting the Fed's move as a sign that inflationary pressures
would be tightly controlled, many traders took the view that Mr Greenspan
raised rates because he feared inflation would rise. As a result long bond
yields have risen sharply - to well over 6.5 per cent.
Markets reacted particularly adversely to a report last week from the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, showing a marked increase in prices
paid by manufacturers. This was seen as indicating that inflation would rise
later this year, and more than offset the positive impact of figures showing
a zero increase in consumer prices last month.
In yesterday's twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony, Mr
Greenspan noted that 'a number of commodity prices have firmed noticeably in
recent months.' But he warned markets against reading too much into the
Philadelphia Fed report.
'In the past such price data have often been an indication more of strength
in new orders and activity than a precursor of rising inflation throughout
the economy. . . overall cost and price pressures still appear to remain
damped. Wages do not seem to be accelerating despite scattered reports of
some skilled-worker shortages, and advances in productivity early this year
are holding down unit labour costs.'
Mr Greenspan also responded to fears in financial markets that inflationary
pressures would build up because economic growth was not decelerating much
this quarter in spite of bad weather and the Los Angeles earthquake.
Official figures next week are expected to show that real GDP grew more than
6 per cent in the final period of last year. Some analysts fear that much of
this momentum carried over into the first quarter.
Mr Greenspan said it was 'too early to judge the degree of underlying
economic strength.' Anecdotal evidence pointed to continued strength of
manufacuturers' orders and production. But 'labour markets are signalling a
somewhat less buoyant degree of activity as initial claims for unemployment
insurance in recent weeks have moved up a notch.'
The implication is that Mr Greenspan believes the bond market's negative
reaction to recent data is overdone: the economy is probably growing
steadily, rather than at the overheated pace of late last year; inflation,
meanwhile, remains pretty subdued.
The Fed had nudged rates higher not because current inflation data was
alarming but in order to prevent problems emerging in 1995 and 1996. Mr
Greenspan stressed again that monetary policy takes effect with a lag of at
least a year. 'The firming in reserve market pressures was undertaken to
preserve and protect the ongoing economic expansion by forestalling a future
destabilising build-up of inflationary pressures. . . We viewed our move as
low-cost insurance.'
He added that rates had been lowered to abnormally low levels in the early
1990s to offset the deflationary impact of the debt build-up at the end of
the 1980s and the subsequent decline in real estate prices. 'Debt repayment
burdens had been lowered enough to unleash strong aggregate demand in the
economy.' Real short-term rates of close to zero thus 'pose an unacceptable
risk of engendering future problems.' Hence the decision to begin raising
rates.
Mr Greenspan signalled that the Fed's goal was to restore real short-term
interest rates to a 'neutral level.' He could not say with assurance
precisely what constituted neutrality. However, 'to promote sustainable
growth, history suggests that real short-term rates are more likely to have
to rise than fall from here.' He hoped that some part of any increase in
real short-term rates could be achieved 'through further declines in
inflation expectations rather than through higher nominal short-term rates."
Mr Greenspan said monetary targets for 1994 would be unchanged from the
preliminary ranges set last July. This implies a target of 1-5 per cent
annual growth for M2, the main broad monetary measure. However, he said the
Fed would not put much weight on the behaviour of the monetary aggregates.
Monetary signals had been 'effectively jammed by structural changes in
financial markets and the unusual nature of the current business cycle.'
US monetary policy thus depended on 'ongoing assessments of the totality of
incoming information.' Among other indicators, the Fed was closely watching
'the price of gold, which has been especially sensitive to inflation
concerns, the exchange rate, and the term structure of interest rates.'
The Fed's economic projections for this year closely mirrored those of the
administration and private forecasters. It expected real growth of 3 per
cent or slightly higher, and a further edging down of the unemployment rate.
Inflation would be about 3 per cent, or slighly higher than last year. With
competitive products and an improving world economy, US export grwoth was
likely to strengthen this year, lessening the external drag on economic
growth.
Provided a prudent monetary policy kept inflation in check, the long-term US
economic outlook remained the best Mr Greenspan had seen in decades.

The Venezuelan government has become de facto owner of several domestic
banks as a result of heavy financial assistance to the sector in the wake of
the failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, last month.
In return for aid to banks hit by unusually large withdrawals in recent
weeks the administration has taken as collateral assets and shares at
several banks amounting to 51 per cent or more of their stock, according to
a Caracas banking official.
While neither the government nor individual banks were willing to provide
details, press reports yesterday said the banks receiving most aid from the
Central Bank and the deposit guarantee fund were Banco Maracaibo, Banco
Construccion, Banco La Guaira, Banco Barinas, Banco Metropolitano and
Sociedad Financera Fiveca.
Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, has made it clear the government does not
wish to own these banks or to 'nationalise' the banking system.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Japan pulled 'by economic tug of war'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy is locked in a 'tug of war' between forces of growth and
decline, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central bank, said yesterday.
Positive factors, such as record low interest rates and the government's
latest economic pump-priming package, were finely balanced against the
constraints of continuing job reductions, the restructuring of banks'
balance sheets and the recent 'excessive' strength of the yen, he said.
But a gloomy report from the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday
is likely to increase pressure on the Bank of Japan for another cut in its
official discount rate, from 1.75 per cent, at which it has stood for six
months.
The EPA's index of leading indicators, a pointer to business conditions in
the next few months, fell to 36.4 per cent in December, the eighth month
running for which this index has stood below the 50 per cent dividing line
between growth and decline, compared with 41.7 per cent recorded in
November.
The index's components show conflicting trends, illustrating Mr Mieno's
economic tug of war. Construction starts continued a three-month rising
trend, as did business confidence among small and medium companies. New job
offers rose in December for the second month running, while commodity prices
picked up for the first time in 10 months.
On the negative side, money supply was weak, sales of consumer durables fell
for the third month running, and department store sales continued a 22-month
decline. The EPA's coincident index, a barometer of present conditions, fell
to 25 per cent in December, the third month in which it stood below 50 per
cent.
If the Bank of Japan continues to follow its usual caution on interest
changes, it is likely to defer any decision until after the Group of Seven
finance ministers' meeting next weekend and after the publication of its own
Tankan quarterly survey of business confidence, Japan's most authoritative
indicator of the short-term outlook, early next month.
Separately, Japan's car makers continued to trim production in line with
weak demand last month, when vehicle output fell 13.5 per cent from January
1993, the 16th consecutive monthly fall, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association said.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Drug cost reform finalised today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare will today finalise reforms
aimed at further controlling government expenditure on medicines. These
represent about 25 per cent of health care costs.
The latest moves threaten to undermine growth of the Japanese market, the
world's second largest. The ministry has already announced a price cut
averaging 6.6 per cent due to be implemented at the beginning of April.
The package being considered today includes measures to extend fixed-cost
reimbursement to psychiatric hospitals, controls on spending on drugs used
during blood dialysis, and an end to reimbursement for vitamins prescribed
to out-patients.
The move to extend fixed-cost reimbursement to psychiatric hospitals could
seriously affect the market for Japanese central nervous system drugs.
Broker BZW estimates sales for such medicines reached Y538bn (Pounds 3.4bn)
in 1992, making it the second largest therapeutic category. Most sales are
through hospitals.
A similar fixed reimbursement scheme introduced during the early 1990s
covering chronic care of the elderly led to a significant reduction in drugs
spending in affected hospitals. Under the schemes, a fixed amount is paid by
the government for treating certain conditions. The hospitals, whose margins
became dependent on keeping down costs, therefore have an incentive to
reduce prescribing.
The new rules covering dialysis would set a fixed limit on medical costs per
day and should lead to an increase in prescribing of cheaper drugs. Broker
Baring Securities estimated the market for associated products is worth
Y37bn-Y39bn a year. It predicted sales of Kissei Pharmaceutical's product
Fragmin could fall 10 per cent, while drugs marketed by Banyu
Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Merck of the US, and Torii would drop
further. But these drugs are a small proportion of the groups' sales.
The package is expected to be implemented in April, apart from the
de-listing of vitamins, which would be introduced in October.

<TEXT>
The move to review Japan's policy on high definition TV is a stunning
admission by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry that the 30-year
experiment in advanced television has been a dismal failure.
The development over 30 years by NHK of Hi-Vision had become something of a
national project supported both by the ministry and the consumer electronics
industry. In recent years the industry was desperately hoping to turn HDTV
into its next blockbuster hit and stimulate flagging consumer demand for
electronic goods.
However, in the time that it took NHK to develop and market Hi-Vision and
equipment makers to bring the price of television sets down to affordable
levels, advances in digital technology have opened the way to bringing the
benefits of the computer, which uses digital technology, to the TV, which
currently uses analogue technology.
The industry expects computers and televisions gradually to converge so that
intelligent functions that have hitherto only been possible on computers,
particularly the manipulation of data, are expected to be increasingly
possible on the TV set as well.
With the advent of multi-media interactive television, which brings together
the functions of telecommunications, computers and consumer electronics, the
likelihood of TVs going down the digital route is even greater, since
digital technology would provide the common language to link the three
industries.
Rapid moves in the US towards building an information superhighway have also
raised concerns, even at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, that
Japan may be left behind in the move to interactive television.
The ministry recently announced its intention of speeding up investment in
advanced telecommunications to pave the way for interactive multi-media
entertainment in Japan. A similar step in broadcasting to build the right
environment for digital TV would complement its move in the
telecommunications field.
Meanwhile, Japan's analogue HDTV project has not fared well in the current
economic climate. Private broadcasters have been reluctant to invest in the
system, resulting in a lack of programming, and consumers have been
discouraged from buying the Y1m (Pounds 6,300) TV sets. Although NHK boasts
superior picture quality for Hi-Vision, many consumers feel the improvement
in picture quality does not justify the high price.
Consumers are also aware that TV technology is likely to turn digital and do
not see any compelling need to take the transitional step to analogue HDTV,
points out Mr Koichiro Chiwata, industry analyst at Solomon Brothers.
While the development of digital TV still has some way to go, the
expectation, supported by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's latest
stance, that eventually TVs will become digital, will put a further damper
on the sale of analogue HDTV systems.
The industry, which is placed in the awkward position of having sold
equipment which could be outdated relatively soon is furious with the
ministry for undermining the prospects of Hi-Vision.
The ministry itself, having long been a champion of Hi-Vision, is likely to
be deeply divided over what policy it should adopt.
As a result the likely scenario is for the ministry not to abandon Hi-Vision
entirely but to continue with experimental Hi-Vision broadcasts as it
promotes the development of a digital system.
The next question is whether Japan opts for a digital system of its own, or
adopts the system being developed in the US which, given the European
Union's leanings in that direction, could pave the way for a worldwide
digital TV standard.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Digital is that bit better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital television is to analogue TV as a superstore is to the corner shop.
Once information is coded in a common digital form, the possibilities become
almost infinite. Digital signals are the traffic on an information
superhighway. In practice, any form of information - text, graphics, sound,
video images - can be represented in computer language as a code of a series
of binary digits (bits).
Bits are transmitted along a communications channel - cable, telephone line,
or through the ether - to the television set. Powerful computers and clever
software sort the bits out, one from another, and recombine them into
information which can be displayed on the screen and output through the loud
speakers.
There are two principal advantages. First, the reproduction of information
coded in bits is more accurate than analogue transmission. So quality of
sound and image is significantly better. Colours are better presented.
Patterns appear natural instead of the mess of ghosts and halos seen on
conventional television sets.
Second, bits representing various kinds of information travel together in
the same channel, making possible interactive multi-media.
Still and moving pictures can be combined on one screen; high fidelity
sound, graphics and text can be added. Most important, the viewer will be
able to interact with the programme displayed, sending messages and
instructions back along the transmission path in digital form.

FT  23 FEB 94 / US technology takes lead on HDTV: For once, the Japanese
have been left behind in the consumer electronics field

<TEXT>
The establishment of a world-wide digital standard for high definition
television appears likely following Japan's review of its support for the
older, analogue system that it has previously promoted.
The Japanese move comes as the US is poised to finalise its own digital HDTV
standards and begin field tests of the new technology. The results of these
tests will come under close scrutiny from Japan as well as Europe, raising
the potential for world-wide adoption of the US system.
The US HDTV standard has two important attractions. First, it can co-exist
with existing analogue TV broadcast standards, so that consumers are not
forced to buy new TV sets, although they must do so in order to receive
high-definition pictures. Second, the digital US HDTV standard is well
suited to interactive television that provides services such as 'movies on
demand' and television shopping.
Japan's early lead in HDTV spurred major efforts in the US in the late 1980s
and early 1990s to develop competing technology. Ironically, however, HDTV
is now considered to be of far less significance in the US than the
development of interactive television services. With the US television,
communications and computer industries now pouring billions of dollars into
creating 'information superhighways' to distribute interactive television
and information services, HDTV is taking a back seat.
Leaders of the European broadcasting and consumer electronics industries
have long seen a Japanese move towards digital transmission as inevitable,
and were not surprised by the announcement of a review.
Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics group, said it would make 'little
difference' to Europe. 'In Europe the decision to move towards digital
transmission for standard and higher definition television was taken over a
year ago, and the TV production standard is already digital today.'
Last September the European Union formed a Digital Video Broadcasting Group,
under the aegis of the German telecommunications ministry, uniting 120
interested parties, including television manufacturers, broadcasters,
satellite operators, governments and the Commission itself, behind a digital
strategy.
This was a deliberate shift away from earlier attempts to impose European
HDTV standards. The group's first objective - largely attained - is to agree
standards for digital satellite transmission at standard definition. It is
also addressing terrestrial standards for standard definition.
European digital satellite broadcasting is expected to start next year, as
additional satellite capacity becomes available. The main aim is to use
digital compression to increase the number of channels that can be
broadcast.
Most of the parties on the European broadcasting group are against the
imposition of HDTV standards in Europe until a market is in prospect.
Wide-screen sets for standard-definition signals is generally considered to
be the next new market for hardware.
Mr David Mercer, an analyst at BIS Strategic Decisions, an IT consultancy,
said the Japanese move was a significant step. 'It leaves the way open for a
common approach to digital standards between the US, Japan and Europe,
though there is still a long way to go.'
Officials in the European Commission yesterday indicated that the Japanese
move was unlikely to have much impact on its own approach.
One commission official said: 'The Japanese have to have some credit for
being the pioneers. But it hasn't been a success in Japan and now everybody
thinks the future will be digital.'
He added: 'Everybody thought (in the 1980s) the Japanese system was going to
be another Japanese walkover and there was indeed panic in Europe to get
something up and running. I suppose this confirms us in what we did.'
In the US, electronics industry officials said they did not yet know enough
about the Japanese move to comment fully, but said it would not be
surprising for Japan to conclude that analogue technology was inadequate in
comparison to available digital technologies.
'We in the US have gone to all-digital technologies and we think we have
leapfrogged the rest of the world,' said Mr John Taylor, a spokesman for
Zenith Electronics, whose VSB transmission system was selected last week by
a US 'Grand Alliance' of electronics manufacturers and laboratories as the
basis for US HDTV.
That selection is due to be presented to an advisory committee of the US
Federal Communications Commission tomorrow for review and approval.

<TEXT>
Pakistan will seek about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in fresh assistance
during talks with donor countries and multilateral agencies at the two-day
annual aid consortium meeting in Paris tomorrow.
The meeting, the first of its kind in almost two years, is important for the
four-month-old government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Last year,
Islamabad postponed the event twice, amid fears donors would be reluctant to
make any large commitments because of political uncertainty. The meeting may
not be immediately followed by disbursements, but an announcement would help
boost Islamabad's image in financial and business sectors.
Pakistan is almost certain to highlight improvements in its official foreign
exchange reserves which now exceed Dollars 1.2bn, up from last July's
all-time low of Dollars 137.5m.
The government claims that large official bank borrowings which had earlier
upset budgetary estimates have been considerably reduced. For the first six
months of the fiscal year (June-December), the figure rose to Rs26bn (Pounds
584m) but has now fallen to Rs10bn.
A campaign to clamp down on tax defaulters has been intensified, with tax
collection officials scrutinising the accounts of large industries which
have declared incomes far below their potential output.
Ms Bhutto recently declared her government's policies would start showing
results within 18 months. But critics argue the new government still needs
to show it is prepared aggressively to push forward the country's
three-year-old programme of economic reforms aimed at eliminating
unnecessary official controls and privatising state-owned utilities and
factories.
Power shortages and lack of road and rail networks also need to be overcome
before new investors enter the market on a large scale, they add.
'The make-or-break issue is the economy. So far, they haven't taken tough
decisions,' says Mr Mahbub-ul-Haq, a former Pakistani finance minister,
working as an adviser to the UN Development Programme in New York. He
favours rapid privatisation to raise funds which could be used for paying
off public sector debt, to eliminate large parts of annual debt payments
which consume almost 30 per cent of the budget.
Other experts say Pakistan is expected to hear donor concerns over the lack
of progress on its privatisation programme, excessive spending on defence
and the need for more social spending.
In Washington, the International Monetary Fund announced yesterday that it
had approved loans totalling 985.7m special drawing rights (Dollars 1.4bn),
under its extended funds facility and its enhanced structural adjustment
facility, a special fund offering highly subsidised credit to poor
countries.

While publicly insisting it has no plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli government has begun
calculating the cost of rehousing the estimated 32,000 Jewish settler
families in homes inside Israel's sovereign borders, a report on state
television said last night.
The report claimed the Finance Ministry has drawn up a working paper which
estimates the cost of rehousing the settlers at Dollars 300,000 per family,
implying a total Dollars 9.6bn (Pounds 6.5bn) to move the entire settler
population.
Under its framework agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation
on limited self-rule for the Palestinians of the occupied territories,
Israel is not obliged to dismantle any of the 140-plus Jewish settlements
over the next five years. The settlements' final status has been left for
negotiation at talks scheduled to begin in 1996.

<TEXT>
China's strategy of improving economic and political relations with Japan,
its largest trade partner, takes a step forward today when Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji begins a nine-day visit to Tokyo.
Mr Zhu, the main influence on Chinese economic policy, will be the first
senior Chinese leader to visit Japan since Premier Morihiro Hosokawa came to
power last August.
He is expected to meet Mr Hosokawa, who is considering a visit to China next
month, and other government ministers for an exchange of views on bilateral
relations, intended to be the start of a series of routine exchange visits.
It comes when Japan's coalition government is changing its policy towards
China, as signalled by Mr Tsutomu Hata (Mr Zhu's Japanese counterpart as
deputy prime minister and foreign minister) on a visit to Beijing in
January.
Mr Hata told his hosts the two should be more frank in discussing sensitive
issues, such as human rights, China's military build-up and the disputed
status of Taiwan. This contrasts with the previous emollient stance of
former Liberal Democratic party governments and echoes the new frankness in
Japan's most important bilateral relationship, with the US.
Chinese officials had feared Japan's government would take a tougher line,
but support Japan's resistance to Washington's trade demands. Mr Zhu's visit
could provide an indication of whether China will now become more direct
with Japan. Economic relations between the two have grown in importance as
China has become a valuable export market and a tempting investment location
for Japanese business.
China was Japan's second largest trading partner after the US last year,
with total exports and imports of Dollars 37.8bn (Pounds 25.5bn), a 30 per
cent increase over 1992, when it was only Japan's fifth trade partner,
according to the Japan External Trade Organisation.
Main growth areas are cars, and telecommunications equipment. Japan's main
imports from China, up 21 per cent to Dollars 20.6bn last year, include
clothes and vegetables.
Jetro expects another 40 per cent rise in Japan's trade with China this
year. China, which is seeking Japanese help for readmission to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, recorded Dollars 39bn-worth of two-way trade
with Japan in 1993.

The South African government and the African National Congress yesterday met
white and black conservative groups in a further attempt to prevent conflict
after the right-wing Freedom Alliance rejected constitutional concessions
aimed at averting an election boycott, writes Patti Waldmeir in
Johannesburg.
President FW de Klerk met Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to respond to the
king's threat to declare a sovereign Zulu state in Natal province. The
government is keen to persuade the Zulu king to endorse elections by
guaranteeing his symbolic status in the new South Africa, in an attempt to
undermine Zulu leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's call on his tribe to

Meanwhile, ANC officials met the Afrikaner Volksfront in a similar attempt
to divide the white right and ensure that moderates such as Gen Constand
Viljoen, AVF leader, endorse the election despite the opposition of Mr Ferdi
Hartzenberg, hard-right Conservative party leader.

FT  23 FEB 94 / IMF gets tough on Nigeria debt deal

<TEXT>
Nigeria must reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on an
economic reform programme before its Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18.9bn) external
debt could be rescheduled, Mr Kalu Kalu, the country's finance minister, was
told yesterday during meetings with British Foreign Office and Treasury
officials.
A Foreign Office statement said the officials 'made clear Britain's desire
to see a return to democracy in Nigeria as soon as possible, and the
Nigerian government was urged to take concrete steps in this direction'.
Mr Kalu is likely to receive an equally blunt message in Washington and
Paris during a 10-day visit to western capitals. His task of defending the
military government's economic policy has been made more difficult by
complaints by bankers in Lagos that Nigeria's new system of direct
allocation of foreign exchange to importers has become entangled in
bureaucracy.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday delayed the allocation for the
second time since last week, blaming intermediary banks for artificially
inflating demand and failing to comply with guidelines.
The CBN is to allocate pro rata for approved applications, with half going
to manufacturers, 30 per cent for finished goods and the rest for
agriculture and invisibles. Bankers say total demand was Dollars
1.5bn-Dollars 2bn for the allocation of Dollars 200m.
There has been no official supply of foreign exchange for two months while
the exchange rate has been fixed at N22 to the dollar, with the black market
rate falling to nearly N50.
The CBN has suspended allocations to 22 designated banks pending snap
investigations, warned another 50 banks to be more accurate, and demanded
from all banks extra copies and more detail about customers' applications.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Patten wins backing for push on HK reform plans

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten yesterday received the support of the
Executive Council, his top advisory body, to push ahead with his plan for
political reform in the colony later this week.
This decision is likely further to anger China, which says the governor's
plans violate previous Sino-British agreements and understandings. China has
said it will hold fresh elections in Hong Kong when it takes over in 1997 if
Britain pushes ahead without agreement.
Mr Patten plans to tell the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) tomorrow
that he will publish a bill on Friday containing his 1992 proposals to
broaden the democratic franchise in Hong Kong. On Friday, he is expected to
publish a 'white paper' giving Britain's account of Sino-British talks held
last year. These talks broke up in November without agreement.
Publication of his second reform bill will follow a vote in LegCo today on
Mr Patten's first reform bill, which lowers Hong Kong's voting age to 18
years.
The government is expected to win today's vote but it may be close run.
Already, 24 of LegCo's 59 voting members have said they will back measures
to amend or delay the bill.
Signs exist that Hong Kong is wearying of its political fight with China. An
opinion poll shows over 70 per cent of respondents were not interested in
the debate over the colony's elections later this year and in 1995. Some 36
per cent favoured passing the first bill, but 50 per cent said they had no
view, the poll, published in the South China Morning Post, said.
The legislation Mr Patten plans to unveil on Friday will include provisions
for nine 'jumbo' electorates, each consisting of 300,000 electors, and the
replacement of corporate with individual voting in Hong Kong's 'functional
constituencies' which represent business and professional groups.
Hong Kong could lose more than a third of its senior civil servants at the
1997 handover to China, a poll of 1,000 of them shows, Reuter reports. The
poll, by the colony's City Polytechnic, showed 35 per cent were unwilling to
stay on beyond 1997.

China has denounced Asia Watch and Amnesty International over new reports of

Walker in Beijing. A Chinese spokesman said an Asia Watch report alleging an
increase in political repression in China ignored recent positive economic
developments. China's reaction reflects sensitivity that the reports may
influence a US decision on renewing China's Most Favoured Nation status.
Losing this would jeopardise billions of dollars' worth of Chinese exports.

One of four units at the Sosnovy Bor nuclear plant near Russia's second
city, St Petersburg, was shut down yesterday after a 'small leakage of
water', Interfax news agency said, Reuter reports from Moscow.
A routine check revealed a hole in a welded section of pipe in the reactor's
emergency cooling system, the report said. A leak at Sosnovy Bor in March
1992 triggered international concern, with radioactive iodine and inert
gases escaping after a loss of pressure in a reactor channel.
The Norwegian radiation protection authority said of the incident: 'The
reactor is now in a stable, shut-down condition with normal cooling. There
has been no emission exceeding the permitted limits.'

</HEADLINE>

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Leonid Kravchuk of the Ukraine has thrown into doubt the agreement
to rid his territory of nuclear missiles by deciding not to stand for
re-election when his first term in office ends this June.
Mr Kravchuk's office yesterday confirmed the president's decision, which
comes amid weeks of fierce debate over Ukraine's intractable economic
crisis.
In a front-page interview in the morning's Demokratichna Ukraina newspaper,
Mr Kravchuk said he had made 'a final decision' not to seek a second term
because he could not, 'defend the current economic, social situation' to his
people. The surprise decision coincided with the government's announcement
to issue a wave of credits, totalling 10 per cent of last year's gross
national product, to support industry and agriculture.
His departure in four months casts a shadow over the deal to rid Ukraine of
nuclear weapons, signed with Presidents Bill Clinton of the US and Boris
Yeltsin of Russia last month in Moscow. The west was counting on Mr Kravchuk
to ensure the implementation of the agreement since the Ukrainian parliament
has still failed to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would
guarantee Ukraine's non-nuclear status.
Mr Kravchuk's first term was supposed to last five years until 1996, but a
political deadlock between parliament and president last September was
resolved by scheduling elections for both of them for the first half of this
year. Mr Kravchuk's press secretary, Mr Victor Stelmakh, declined to offer
an explanation for the decision not to seek a second term. 'Look at the
papers,' he said. 'All the reasons are there.'
The president's popularity rating has plummeted as Ukraine's economy has
fallen further into a crisis of hyperinflation, dire energy shortages and a
massive industrial slump.
The 60-year-old former communist party ideology chief, who became president
in 1991, has come under fire for failing to push through any substantial
economic reforms.
A December poll suggested only 11 per cent of Ukrainians had confidence in
their president and only 17 per cent would vote for him on June 26. The
former prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, polled higher. Since that poll,
dissatisfaction and anger have only increased.
Many Ukrainians have gone without wages since December. Enterprises, faced
with a huge credit squeeze, have held back deliveries and cut production.

The Russian central bank yesterday announced that it would conduct an
experimental credit auction for the refinancing of commercial banks.
It said that Rbs70bn would be offered at an auction next Monday in which
commercial banks would submit bids to regional branches of the central bank.
A central bank official said the total Rbs130bn which the bank intended to
offer at auction in the first quarter of this year, would account for about
5-7 per cent of central bank credits.
The aim of the operation, was to move away from the antiquated system
whereby bureaucrats distribute refinancing funds for supporting priority
sectors of the economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven
industrialised nations will be calling on the new Russian government to give
them clear assurances this weekend of its determination to bring the
country's soaring inflation rate under control.
In return, the G7 hopes to be able rapidly to liberate the substantial funds
agreed at the last world economic summit in Tokyo, but blocked by the lack
of progress in the Russian reform programme.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and host at the top-level talks
on Russia to take place outside Frankfurt on Saturday, yesterday stressed
particularly the need for a clear anti-inflation strategy, to provide
reassurance not only for the G7 governments, but also for foreign investors.
'The danger of hyperinflation, with its destabilising, destructive and
anti-social consequences, must be avoided,' Mr Waigel said yesterday. 'That
is the lesson of our own bitter experience, both in the 1920s, and after the
Second World War.'
He made his statement against a background of western concern at the
relaxation of the Russian government's former tough anti-inflation strategy,
although that is tempered by understanding at the political backlash
triggered by the reform policies.
Mr Waigel has invited Mr Sergei Dubinin, the new Russian finance minister,
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the economy minister, and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the
governor of the Russian central bank, to attend the talks at Kronberg, to
take stock of the state of the reform programme.
The G7 will receive reports from Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director
of the IMF, and Mr Lewis Preston, the president of the World Bank, giving
their assessment of the Russian economy.
Mr Waigel said the G7 meeting was also intended to consider the state of the
world economy, and expressed his confidence that a gradual upturn was under
way.
He expressed his concern at the trade conflict which has broken out between
the US and Japan, and urged both sides to reach a resolution.
The German government is obviously concerned that the meeting, intended
above all to consider the plight of the Russian economy, might end up being
dominated by the US-Japanese question.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Volga car sell-off reveals Dollars 30m abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian authorities have been seriously embarrassed by the director of a car
plant who used Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m) in tax credits earmarked for
investment to build a controlling stake in the company.
The government commission dealing with the case said Mr Boris Vedyaev,
director of the GAZ plant which makes the Volga cars favoured by Russian
officials and taxi-drivers, spent Rbs46.5bn, or half the tax credit he was
given to produce a new type of truck, on buying privatisation vouchers. Mr
Vedyaev made agreements with 15 proxy companies to buy shares at public
auctions. Mr Vedyaev now controls, directly or indirectly, 30 per cent of
GAZ, including the 5 per cent he was allowed to acquire as the plant's
manager.
The affair will test the authorities' ability to check abuses by directors
in the government's mass privatisation programme, as well as pinpointing
widespread waste of state funds designed to promote economic recovery.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister who tried to impose financial
discipline on officials bound to special interests, cited the GAZ case as an
example of how 'industrial lobbies extract subsidies, benefits, deferrals
but spend the money god knows how'. At stake too is the prestige of Mr Boris
Nemtsov, progressive governor of the Nizhny-Novgorod region, regarded as a
laboratory for reforms, who has vowed to have the director removed. 'All the
directors in the region will eat him alive if Vedyaev is allowed to get away
with this,' said one of Mr Nemtsov's colleagues.
However, Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister attached to the
commission investigating the case, said he believed Russia's antiquated
legislation contained no criminal penalty for the violations committed by
the GAZ director. The government's only recourse was to have him sacked at a
shareholders' meeting. But in the month before such a meeting could be
convened, said Mr Alexashenko, the GAZ director could strip the company of
assets. The state still controls a majority of voting shares, which account
for 35 per cent of the company's capital.
The liberal Nevazisimya newspaper said the case was being watched as a
'precedent by all thieving directors who survive on state funds'.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Gasprom added to list for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gasprom, Russia's state-owned gas-producing monopoly, is to be partially
privatised under the government's sweeping sell-off of state assets which
aims to put 80 per cent of the country's industrial capacity into private
hands by July 1, a Gasprom official confirmed yesterday.
The official, who is responsible for securities at Gasprom, told the
Financial Times that 15 per cent of the giant company was already being
offered to company employees who had begun acquiring shares with
privatisation vouchers distributed free to all Russian citizens.
A further 28.7 per cent would be offered to Russian citizens across the
country. Although he gave no dates, he said shares would be offered at
privatisation auctions around Russia. An additional 5 per cent would be
offered to ethnic minorities in the gas-rich Yamal-Nenetsk peninsula, in the
far north.
Gasprom would be allowed to sell 10 per cent of the shares directly to
investors, including foreigners, for cash which it would be allowed to keep
for investment in the development of Yamal-Nenetsk's gas reserves.
Given the strategic role of Gasprom, The state would keep a 40 per cent
stake in the company, which is as a big export revenue earner, for at least
three years.
According to government statistics, Russia exported 96bn cubic meters of
natural gas outside the former Soviet Union in 1993, worth Dollars 7.2bn
(Pounds 4.9bn). Total production last year amounted to 618bn cubic meters.
However, it is beset with problems, including non-paying customers, and
former Soviet republics which regularly get their supplies cut off for
non-payment. Despite the fact that Gasprom has money in the bank, workers in
individual regions have on occasion had to strike to get their salaries
paid. Although it is considered to be a relatively smooth operation, another
problem is inefficiency and under-investment plaguing most of Russian
industry. Experts at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
estimate that leakages and low pressure contribute to waste equivalent to
Belgium's annual gas consumption.
Gasprom, previously headed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, has in the past resisted attempts by the privatisation ministry to
include the company in its radical campaign.
Critics of voucher privatisation argue that it does not raise badly-needed
cash for companies but gives their shares away for a song. Mr Chernomyrdin
himself last year compared the privatisation programme to Stalin's
collectivisation of agriculture.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Italian government brokers Fiat peace deal with union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has brokered a costly deal between Fiat, the
country's biggest private employer, and the unions to avoid big job losses
and lay-offs in the motor industry. Fiat lost close to L1,800bn (Pounds
730m) last year.
The deal, affecting 16,600 of Fiat's 95,000 Italian workforce, contains
three main elements: an unprecedented use of early retirement for 6,600, and
special funding for 2,200 losing their jobs; introduction of work sharing
and a shorter working week influenced by events at Volkswagen; a commitment
by the government and Fiat to invest L450bn (Pounds 182m) in developing
non-polluting cars.
An industry analyst described the agreement as 'the last of the old-style
corporatist deals with the state bankrolling labour peace and giving Fiat a
helping hand'. A leading member of the FIOM engineering union said: 'We
fought hard to make the point that this is throwing money at funding job
losses instead of finding money to finance an industrial strategy. This is a
financial solution; it does not secure the industrial future of Fiat or
future jobs in the motor industry.'
Fiat announced in November it wanted to cut the labour force by 5 per cent
and lay off 10 per cent more for two years. When it began implementing the
programme last month without union agreement there were stoppages at Fiat
plants, especially those most at risk of closure.
With a general election in March, the government has been anxious to bring
the two sides together to avoid serious labour unrest.
Fiat has made an important concession in accepting the principle of
'solidarity contracts', a catch-all phrase covering work-sharing, a shorter
working week and lower salaries to ensure that people keep their jobs. Until
recently, it was insisting that this was not a productive use of labour and
proposed lay-offs for two years pending a sales recovery.
In return for acceptance the government has shouldered more of the social
and political cost of streamlining Fiat's automotive operations. Some 2,200
jobs have been saved. However, the unions have not obtained the kind of
guarantees they would like about Fiat's future.

France and Germany achieved sharp increases in their trade surpluses last
year as recession in both countries smothered imports and more than
compensated for falling exports.
The French customs office yesterday reported a record FFr87.3bn (Pounds
10bn), double official forecasts.
Germany's surplus nearly doubled to DM59.4bn (Pounds 23bn) as imports fell
more sharply than exports in the worst domestic recession since the second
world war.
The French surplus reflected the impact of recession, which contributed to a
10.4 per cent fall in imports to FFr1,091bn. It also showed the resilience
of exports which declined by just over 5 per cent to FFr1,181bn despite
depressed demand in Germany and the negative effect of currency depreciation
in Italy, Spain and the UK.
significan
Germany exports fell for the year by 10 per cent to DM603.5bn while imports
decreased by 14.7 per cent to DM544.1bn, according to statistical office
figures. Both imports and exports recorded their sharpest decline since the
war.
The current account deficit was reduced to DM36bn from DM39bn the previous
year.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Aid for Arctic region agreed: Marathon negotiating session
this weekend on EU enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union foreign ministers yesterday made a breakthrough in membership
talks for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway with agreement on a regional
aid programme for the Arctic regions of the Nordic countries.
Austria warned, however, that the negotiations could collapse unless its
concerns were met on lorry traffic through its Alpine passes. Switzerland
decided last weekend to phase out truck transit rights through its own Alps.
Because of diverted traffic, Austria wants the EU transit restrictions it
negotiated with the Union to extend until 2005. The EU is offering 1997.
As both sides drew up positions for what is supposed to be the final
ministerial negotiation between next Friday evening and midnight next
Monday, there were still seemingly unbridgeable wide gaps. Leading EU
negotiators were predicting crisis.
The focal points of disagreement have been: how to cut Nordic and Alpine
farm prices to EU levels and who should compensate the farmers; how much the
newcomers should pay into the EU budget; Norwegian fish; and EU transit
rights through Austria's Alps.
Regional aid could now be resolved. The Nordic countries reacted favourably
yesterday to the new Arctic regime, offering funding only 10 per cent less
favourable than that for the EU's poorest regions (which will still be
offered to Burgenland on Austria's border with Hungary).
By yesterday Finland had cleared most of its negotiating hurdles except
agriculture, and Sweden would be in sight of the finishing line but for its
insistence on a three-year rebate from the EU budget. Austria also wants to
phase in its budget contributions.
Money will overshadow much of next weekend's marathon talks. On agriculture,
for example, the Twelve want instant food price cuts to EU levels, with the
applicant countries paying the difference to their farmers. Austria and
Norway want transitions to EU price levels, with border rebates to iron out
the differences. This is regarded as an unacceptable threat to the
border-free single market by all in the EU except Britain and
fundamentalists in the Brussels agriculture directorate.
At Spain's insistence, the EU was last night set to demand modest access to
Norway's fisheries resources in exchange for free entry of Norwegian fish
into the single market - still being resisted by France and Ireland.
Norway's last membership attempt in 1972 was scuppered by the fish
controversy, and Oslo has promised not to surrender a single fish to the EU.
Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's European affairs minister, said Madrid was
willing to negotiate, but if the Norwegians 'stick to that zero quota to the
end, I foresee a catastrophe'. As the EU finalised its common view on fish
last night, a senior Commission official predicted that 'any likely position
we reach is going to be so far from the Norwegians as to make it
impossible.'

FT  23 FEB 94 / IG Metall aims low in Lower Saxony action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by IG Metall, the German engineering union, to call a strike
ballot in the state of Lower Saxony was dictated almost entirely by tactical
reasons, union officials confirmed yesterday.
More than anything else, the move underlines the extreme hesitancy with
which the union is moving towards a strike, in the midst of the sharpest
recession since the war and rapidly rising unemployment. It also indicates
its desire to keep such action small-scale and geographically limited.
"We do not want a big social conflict,' Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union leader,
has said repeatedly.
Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, is much more sceptical. 'By
avoiding total confrontation, and choosing a place where the pressure is not
real, it suggests the action is more of a ritual than reality,' Mr Werner
Rieck, the federation spokesman, said.
Lower Saxony only has 90,000 engineering workers at some 230 companies, and
the union would initially only call out 10,000-20,000, assuming the strike
ballot votes at least 75 per cent in favour of strike action, which IG
Metall takes for granted.
In addition, the state's engineering companies are less dominated by
suppliers of the motor industry, and other highly inter-related engineering
activities, which would cause a rapid knock-on effect from strike action.
IG Metall wants to avoid such effects because they could cause a backlash
against the strike from fellow workers. Under new labour legislation,
workers laid off or put on short-time working because of strike action do
not qualify for any relief payments.
Lower Saxony is also important for the union for two other vital reasons.
In the first place, it is the home base of Volkswagen, the motor giant which
has agreed a wage deal with the union along precisely the lines IG Metall
wants from the engineering industry as a whole: a cut in working hours (to a
four-day week) in exchange for job security.
In the second place, the choice will immediately politicise the struggle,
because state elections are due on March 13, one week after the strike is
set to start.
For their part, IG Metall officials are increasingly convinced that the
employers do not want a rapid settlement, but are prepared to face a strike,
in the hope of winning and forcing through a very different wage deal for
the current year.
It would be little more than a loose framework for plant level bargaining,
with big moves to make working time more flexible - including longer hours,
as well as shorter.
Both sides believe there will be at least one final effort to reach a
settlement, probably after the strike ballot has taken place on March 1-3.
It gives them both a last chance to head off the stoppage in Lower Saxony,
now scheduled for March 7.
The danger for them both is that even if it starts small, the action could
spread to the entire northern coastal region.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Bid to build on Sarajevo ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior foreign ministry officials from the US, Russia, the European Union,
Canada and the United Nations met in Bonn yesterday to try to maintain the
momentum of the Sarajevo ceasefire and bind both Moscow and Washington into
the peace process.
With the US now prepared to play a greater diplomatic role in ending the
Bosnian war, military strategists warned against any delay. 'Bosnian Serb
and Croat forces could capitalise on the ceasefire in Sarajevo by
consolidating territorial gains in other parts of the country,' a senior
British military expert said. Yesterday, Serb forces bombarded the
Bosnian-held enclave of Bihac, in the northwest.
'If the US is really on board, then European governments must send more
peacekeeping troops, and Washington must start doing so as well. This is
crucial,' he said. There was already too much foot-dragging on this issue,
he added, pointing out that General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in
Bosnia, never received the 3,000 extra troops required to demilitarise
Sarajevo.
At the Bonn meeting, attended by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign
minister, and Mr Charles Redman, President Bill Clinton's special envoy,
European officials said all participants had 'agreed on a common agenda and
a common analysis'. It includes:
All possible measures to extend the Sarajevo ceasefire and normalise life in
the city. This would include opening access roads, removing all road blocks,
enabling access for road traffic, and all possible demilitarisation of the
city.
Re-establishment of some semblance of city government, although that would
immediately raise the question of who gained what ground in the territorial
division of Bosnia.
Prevention of the heavy weapons withdrawn from Sarajevo being deployed in
other battlefields - an absolutely essential measure, according to Mr Jurgen
Chrobog, German foreign ministry political director, who chaired the talks.
Officials also want to secure a lasting ceasefire in Mostar, besieged by the
Croats. But western governments have failed to persuade the Croats to
withdraw over 8,000 troops now in western Hercegovina.
'We have exerted no real pressure on the Croats, We cannot even threaten
them with sanctions because Germany will block them,' a western diplomat
said.
Britain and France intend to seek a mandate in New York for UN activities in
the region. They also want to try to open Tuzla airport, by March 7
according to UN officials, as well as start gaining access to the Bosnian
enclave of Maglaj, where thousands of people are starving because of a Serb
siege.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Recovery to withstand tax rises say 'wise men': Increase in
interest rates seen by Treasury advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economic recovery is strong enough to withstand the impact of tax
rises this spring, the Treasury's panel of independent advisers said
yesterday.
In an unexpectedly optimistic assessment of the economy, four of the six
'wise men' backed the government's view that the Budget measures would not
severely dent growth and forecast that the next move in interest rates would
be upwards.
The prediction on interest rates came as Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the
Federal Reserve Board, said the US central bank was leaning towards using
higher interest rates to combat inflation and keep growth on track.
The UK economists' report - the first to be presented to the chancellor this
year - was surprising after last week's disappointing economic data. All but
two of the economists said further monetary loosening was unnecessary, even
after the higher taxes hit consumers in April.
The panel, in its first assessment since November's Budget, said bigger
incomes would neutralise the extra taxes while optimism about the economy
would encourage people to dip in to their savings.
Its generally positive view of the government's economic policies came as
figures showed an upwards revision to fourth quarter growth figures. The
Central Statistical Office said gross domestic product rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.8 per cent on the previous quarter, up from an earlier estimate
of 0.7 per cent.
But an announcement yesterday from Unilever, the food and consumer products
group, that it is to shed up to 1,000 jobs in the UK over the next three
years served as a reminder that unemployment remains high. The panel
predicts that the jobless total will stay above 2m over the next four years.
In the Commons, Mr John Major described the recovery as 'steady' and said it
showed signs of continuing. 'I think there is no doubt among any of our
European partners about the strength of the economic recovery in this
country,' he said.
The consensus among the advisers, who drafted their individual reports
before last week's poor economic indicators were known, is that the economy
will grow by 2.7 per cent this year, and by roughly the same in 1995.
Only professors Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Wynne Godley of
Cambridge University believe the UK should follow the US where cuts in
interest rates had generated a solid recovery without rekindling inflation.
All six expect inflation to be within the government's 1-4 per cent target
range this year.

FT  23 FEB 94 / 3i banks plan summer flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high street banks that own 3i, the leading provider of risk capital to
small and medium-sized businesses in the UK, have agreed to float part of
the company this summer.
The long-delayed attempt to obtain a Stock Exchange listing for 3i, owned by
six clearing banks and the Bank of England, will be announced by the company
this morning. The flotation could place a value of Pounds 1.5bn on 3i
shares.
3i directors expect the banks to sell about 40 per cent of the company, and
believe this could be worth about Pounds 600m. They estimate the current
market value of the company's assets at up to Pounds 1.7bn, compared with
Pounds 1.3bn last year.
This morning's announcement will disclose only the flotation timetable. It
is likely to say that 3i will definitely proceed with a partial flotation
this summer, subject to force majeure such as a stock market crash, or an
unexpected change in the value of company assets.
Efforts to float 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, have been
dogged by delays since the idea was mooted in 1990. Mr Alan Wheatley, 3i's
former chairman, resigned in April after the last attempt was postponed.
Conditions for a 3i flotation have since improved. Barclays and National
Westminster, which own 41 per cent of the company between them, are thought
to have believed at the time that a delay could increase the value of 3i
shares.
Shares of comparable venture capital investment trusts have risen sharply
since then and now trade at an average price of 89 per cent of the value of
net assets. Given net assets of Pounds 1.7bn, this would value 3i shares at
about Pounds 1.5bn.
The banks would have to sell at least 25 per cent between them to achieve a
listing under Stock Exchange rules, although a 3 per cent stake held by Bank
of Scotland could count towards the 25 per cent without being sold.
3i, which was founded in 1945, is the biggest enterprise of its type in
Europe. It performs a crucial role in the finance of small and medium-sized
businesses by taking long-term minority stakes in them to help them grow.
Although it contributes to banks' profits through dividends and a rise in
the value of its investments, there is also some overlap between their
activities. Most of the banks also provide loan and equity finance to small
companies.
There has been renewed speculation that 3i is preparing for a flotation
since it announced earlier this month that it was raising a Pounds 236m fund
for investing in continental Europe. This was its first move into managing
funds for others.
This diversification could make flotation easier if fees from fund
management increase earnings. 3i's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 56m for
the year to last March after a turnaround in performance in the second half.
Neither the company nor the shareholder banks would comment last night.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Mercedes and Swatch join forces to develop minicar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the German executive and luxury carmaker, is joining forces
with SMH, the company that saved the Swiss watch industry with the launch of
the Swatch, to develop a small car for city use.
The so-called Swatchmobile has been promoted for several years by Mr
Nicholas Hayek, chairman of SMH (Ste Suisse Microelectronique et
d'Horlogerie), who masterminded the rescue of the Swiss watch industry in
the 1980s.
Prototypes have appeared hitherto as two-seater minicars with a variety of
propulsion units ranging from electric to petrol and hybrid systems.
The German carmaker said that co-operation with SMH held 'promising
possibilities for the development, manufacture and marketing of automobiles
geared particularly to city use'. The board of Daimler-Benz, the
Mercedes-Benz parent company, yesterday approved its car division's plan to
set up a development company with SMH.
The joint venture is expected to be established next month.
A similar joint venture between SMH and Volkswagen, the German volume
carmaker, foundered a year ago when VW withdrew because of pressure from its
sharply rising losses.
Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it had not been decided whether any car
developed with SMH would be sold under the Mercedes badge, nor whether it
would be sold and marketed through the existing Mercedes-Benz sales network.
Mercedes-Benz's move to enter a joint venture with SMH, whose recent success
has been founded on the production of low-price, high-quality watches as
fashion accessories, marks another dramatic departure from its traditional
area of prestige executive and luxury cars.
In the past 18 months the German carmaker has embarked on a transformation
of its new model development strategy, which is aimed at taking it into
several new segments of the world car market, including small cars, four
wheel drive sports/utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles.
It has recently announced plans to build a small, four-passenger car at a
plant in Germany with output of up to 200,000 cars a year and aimed for
launch in 1997.
This model, shown as a concept car, Vision A-93, at several international
motor shows last year, is designed to be smaller than a Volkswagen Golf or a
Ford Escort but considerably longer than the planned Swatchmobile.

FT  23 FEB 94 / Senior CIA agent charged with spying for Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<TEXT>
The US issued a strong formal protest to the Russian government yesterday
after the arrest of a senior Central Intelligence Agency official and his
wife on charges of spying for Moscow.
'It is a very serious case,' President Bill Clinton said after the arrests
had been made public.
Charges filed in a federal court in Virginia said Mr Aldrich Ames, a 31-year
CIA veteran, had spied for the Soviet Union from 1985 until its collapse in
1991, and then continued to spy for the Russian Federation foreign
intelligence service.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, summoned the Russian charge
d'affaires to the State Department to deliver a strongly worded protest, and
Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador to Russia, issued a similar complaint
to officials in Moscow.
White House officials refused to discuss in detail what consequences the
incident might have for US-Russian relations, but would not rule out the
possibility that it could affect the level of US financial aid to Russia.
Last night, a White House official demanded that Russia voluntarily withdraw
the diplomats who handled the CIA agent. If Russia does not take the action,
the official said, 'We'll have to take the action ourselves.'
Although now in the CIA's counter-narcotics unit, Mr Ames was previously in
charge of the Soviet division of its counter-intelligence arm. Government
officials said there had been suspicions as early as 1985 that a mole might
be at work, but the investigation of Mr Ames and his wife Maria began only
10 months ago.
Papers filed with the federal court said top-secret documents unrelated to
Mr Ames's work had been found in his office last June. A subsequent search
of the couple's home produced a typewriter ribbon from which agents
extracted damaging information.
Justice Department officials said Mrs Ames, a 41-year-old Colombian-born,
naturalised US citizen, was co-operating with the investigation, but it was
not clear if she had agreed to testify against her husband. Mr Ames, 52, and
his wife allegedly received more than Dollars 1.5m in exchange for some of
the most damaging secrets ever lost by the US, including details of CIA
operations and agents.
Officials said the arrests capped a two-year probe, which had been
apparently triggered by a tip from a KGB defector.
Last night Mr Toby Jessel, Conservative MP for Twickenham, said he would
raise the issue with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, to find
out if British security had been put at risk or been infiltrated.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: McDonnell poised for market with Pounds
250m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Information Services, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services
company, will float on the main market next month through a placing and
intermediaries offer to raise a net Pounds 107.4m.
Of the funds raised, Pounds 73m will be used to repay borrowings arising out
of last year's management buy-out from McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace
group, and Pounds 34.4m will be used to redeem preference shares.
The pathfinder document was published this morning.
Impact day will be March 8; the latest time and date for receipt of
applications is 10am on March 17 and dealings will begin on March 24.
The flotation is expected to value the company at about Pounds 250m.
The pathfinder shows the value of the management buy-out as Pounds 121m; the
management team - consisting of certain directors and senior employees -
invested a total of Pounds 963,269 for 15.5 per cent of the company's
equity.
Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said this week that he would not be
selling his stake in the company.
On February 4 this year the company had cash balances and short-term
deposits of Pounds 13m, having repaid borrowings of Pounds 8.4m,
restructuring charges of Pounds 5.3m, and interest of Pounds 3.5m since the
buy-out.
MDIS generated operating profits of Pounds 22.3m in 1993 on revenues of
Pounds 148.5m, compared with Pounds 19.1m on Pounds 158.6m the year before.
Revenues have been shrinking as the company has moved away from hardware
towards the more profitable software and services. Operating margins,
however, have grown from 10.4 per cent to 15 per cent in the past three
years.
The flotation will be one of the largest in the information technology
sector for some years. MDIS specialises in open or industry standard systems
for niche markets, with growth potential including central and local
government, the police and the emergency services.
Last year it spent Pounds 17.6m - or 11.8 per cent of turnover - on research
and development.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Relief is palpable in Moscow that Russia's intervention helped persuade the
Serbs to heed Nato's ultimatum, thus avoiding the risk of air strikes,
writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
There had been a widespread fear among Russian officials and Russia watchers
that air strikes would have hurt President Boris Yeltsin by presenting his
already strong ultra-nationalist opposition with a golden opportunity to
undermine him on a second front, namely foreign policy.
After successfully hobbling his course of bold economic reforms, by enabling
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, to squeeze radical reformers out of
the government, they would have used the air strikes against Serbs, fellow
Slavs, to attack the president's pro-western foreign policy.
Presidential officials yesterday lost no time in milking the president's
Bosnian 'triumph' for all its worth. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's
press secretary, said it showed he was 'the unchallenged leader of Russia'.
'The world was almost on the brink of a world crisis, which threatened to
grow into a war drawing in the major powers . . . Without firing a single
shot, without threatening anyone, without putting the lives of its soldiers
at risk, without spending a single rouble, Russia has actually won an
important battle for its world status.'
No doubt cheered by the news, Mr Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin yesterday
after a long and unexplained illness.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A poll by the German news magazine Der Spiegel shows German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) losing ground both to the
opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) and the far-right Republicans in
eastern Germany, AP reports from Bonn.
The poll, which asked voters whom they would vote for in the federal
election if it was held next Sunday, shows the CDU would not be able to form
a coalition government on the state level with its partners, the Free
Democratic party (FDP), in any of the eastern German states.
In Saxony, which the CDU won outright with 53.8 per cent of the vote in the
1990 election, Mr Kohl's party is at present polling only 38 per cent, while
the FDP is attracting only 3 per cent of the vote, down from 5.3 per cent.
In contrast, the SPD is polling 30 per cent, up from 19.1 per cent; the
Republicans are supported by 3 per cent of the voters, up from no measurable
support in 1990.
The former communists, the PDS, are polling 12 per cent, against 10.2 per
cent in the last federal election; support for Bundnis 90/Greens has risen
to 10 per cent from 5.6 per cent in 1990.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the CDU's support has diminished to 20 per cent against 39
per cent in 1990, while the SPD's support has ballooned to 36 per cent from
26. The FDP's support is at present 7 per cent, down from 13.5 per cent,
while the Bundnis 90/Greens attract 13 per cent, compared to 5.3 per cent.
The PDS polls 14 per cent, up from 12 per cent; the Republicans are
supported by 4 per cent of the voters, up from 0.6 per cent in 1990.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Kohl tries to stir CDU fighting spirit: Chancellor launches
offensive against SPD in election marathon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany sought yesterday to galvanise his ruling
Christian Democratic Union out of pre-election pessimism and to take the
offensive against the opposition Social Democratic party.
With an hour-long exhortation to the party faithful, abandoning his usual
careful text and speaking off the cuff, he accused his opponents of
threatening to take Germany back into isolation at the heart of Europe,
unable to play its full role on the international stage.
He stepped up his campaign against the opposition for allegedly preparing to
recognise East German citizenship in the mid-1980s, a move which would have
undermined the entire process towards unification, he said.
He warned that the real alternative to the present ruling
liberal-conservative coalition was a 'red-green' coalition between the SPD
and the Green party, which would make Germany unpredictable and drive away
investors.
It was a personal tour de force to revive the spirits of his CDU, facing a
string of election setbacks before the national poll in October. It earned
the Chancellor a seven-minute standing ovation from an audience desperate
for the prospect of a political revival.
The three-day party conference in Hamburg is supposed to approve a weighty
new party programme, called Freedom and Responsibility, as the foundation of
its cam-paign through no fewer than 19 elections in the next eight months.
Yet Mr Kohl's speech contained no programme: it was rather a presentation of
his own personality, as the chancellor who delivered unification and who had
come to enjoy the trust of states-men throughout the world, as the key to an
election victory.
He insisted that he was fighting for outright victory, but on the platform
of the present coalition. He denounced those who were already arguing in
favour of a 'grand coalition' with the SPD.
It was a speech overwhelmingly about foreign policy, and his own role in
promoting European union, to which he restated his absolute commitment.
He denounced attempts to water down the party's European policy, and remove
its commitment to a 'federal' future for the European Union.
He insisted that German unification had proved possible only as the
counterpart of European union.
It was Germany's unshakeable commitment to European integration which had
persuaded its European partners, as well as Russia and the US, to back the
process of German unification.
'The Social Democrats want to lead our country back to isolation,' he said.
'But isolation must never again become a concept in German history.'
It was a speech to inspire the party faithful, dispirited by election
setbacks last year in Hamburg, where the CDU dropped 10 percentage points to
only 25 per cent support, and in Brandenburg in east Germany, where it
dropped to third place, behind the former communist party.
It was still not enough to head off some sharp criticism from the floor,
with speakers demanding more policies to attract young voters, more to
counter the opposition's accusations that the government is determined to
dismantle the welfare state, and more to woo back the disenchanted voters of
eastern Germany.
But it was just enough to get that standing ovation, and that was what Mr
Kohl required for the television cameras yesterday.

FT  22 FEB 94 / High stakes on both sides in EU entry talks: Attitudes are
hardening on the price to be paid for membership of the club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Even before the European Union's foreign ministers began talking in Brussels
yesterday, the vexed negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and
Norway into the EU had been complicated by hardline Spanish demands.
Among them was Madrid's insistence that money the rich new northerners put
into the Brussels budget should be spent in the poorer south of the Union.
But, as what should have been the beginning of the last lap of the
enlargement talks opened in Brussels, tactically ill-timed requests by
Sweden and Austria that their budget contributions should be phased in
served only to sharpen the money issue prematurely.
The Swedes in particular, who want exemption from three-fifths of their EU
payment for three years, appear to have made Spain's partners more receptive
to the agenda Madrid is trying to set in the talks.
'They (the Swedes) have stirred up such a row that the Spaniards have
broadened their counter-demands,' one of the EU's lead negotiators says.
If membership terms for the applicants are not settled by the first week of
next month, it will become virtually impossible for the four to enter the EU
by January next year as planned.
Missing the deadline, says the senior EU negotiator, 'could decrease their
interest (in joining), and increase our lust for a bigger cake' in terms of
the Nordic and Alpine countries' money and resources.
The UK and Germany, which contribute most to the EU's Ecu70bn (Dollars 77bn)
budget, are, for example, already positioning themselves to demand that the
newcomers' net contributions - worth Ecu1.7bn on the European Commission's
first serious estimates - should be used to reduce their own EU payments.
Until the Swedish budget request, Spain's main concern, shared with the UK,
was to preserve existing EU majority voting rules enabling relatively modest
alliances within the Twelve to block measures affecting their national
interests. 'We really mean it,' said one senior Spanish official recently.
But the Norwegians have since propelled the fish issue up the league table
and the Spanish have leapt upon it. 'They are taking the (fisheries) regime
hostage,' one senior Commission official said of the Spaniards.
Wherever Spain's demands settle, yesterday's lunchtime talks between the
Twelve's foreign ministers left little doubt that the money and resources
question is nagging away at several member states, rich and poor.
Spain has German support in opposing Commission plans to make thinly
populated and inhospitable parts of northern Sweden and Norway eligible for
the same levels of EU regional aid as Andalucia and the eastern German
Lander.
Brussels yesterday backtracked and proposed an analogous, slightly less
generous, and possibly time-limited aid regime, which the applicants at
first sight are inclined to reject.
But it is in the cost of aligning the farm subsidy regimes of the candidate
countries with EU norms that blood could be spilt. Sweden's farm prices are
now close to the EU's, but Austria's are about 25 per cent higher, Finland's
50 per cent more, and Norwegian prices are double those within the Twelve.
The EU concedes that for a mix of socio-economic, cultural, environmental,
and even security reasons, extra farm subsidies to keep the Alps and the
Arctic populated are legitimate. The argument is about who pays.
The latest figures from the Commission's budget directorate calculate that
within the four, Ecu4.1bn is now going to farmers through high prices paid
by consumers, and Ecu2.2bn in direct government aid.
The EU's opening offer is for a 'big bang' price cut to Union levels
immediately on entry, and then only some Ecu2bn in normal common
agricultural policy price support. Formally, the Twelve are prepared to
sanction both transitional and permanent extra aid so long as the applicants
pay for it themselves.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece being too quickly criticised
over Macedonia (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIKOS CHLOROS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Greek disgrace' (February 18), has left at least one
Greek reader quite unhappy. Your paper has been too quick to chastise the
Greek presidency for the 'affront' to its EU partners on the subject of the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). I ask you, who can forget the
recent diplomatic blunder both Britain and Germany committed by visiting
Turkey without even notifying their Greek partners?
How are Greece's EU partners justified in, on the one hand, condemning the
country's consistent foreign policies regarding FYROM and, on the other,
praising its history and heritage that form the basis of the modern western
civilisation? It is, after all, this history and heritage that Greece wishes
to defend from the usurpers of the Vergina flag and the Macedonian name.
Stabilisation in the region is, indeed, in Greece's interests and everybody
hopes for a quick solution on the FYROM problem. However, fuelling EU
impatience and 'intense irritation with Greece' and suggesting what the best
strategy should be 'for a country so heavily dependent on EU funds' do not,
in my opinion, represent constructive criticism.
Inflammatory comments and the passing of such judgment do not fit the
serious profile of your paper.
Nikos Chloros,

FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Germany escaping stranglehold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOLGER SCHMIEDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your stimulating leading article, 'In Germany, it may get worse'
(February 15), seems to portray the looming labour dispute in west German
metal engineering as a threat to a possible recovery. However, it could also
be seen as the birth pangs of a most beneficial revolution.
The labour market is finally escaping the traditional stranglehold of big
labour organisations and big business. The profound change is driven by west
Germany's deepest postwar recession, a structural shift from industry to
less unionised services and a growing awareness of the disaster that
Germany's corporatist organisations caused in east Germany with excessive
wage accords.
This January's pilot agreement in the west German chemicals sector not only
delivered an effective wage increase of 2 percentage points below current
inflation. It did away with more labour market taboos than even the most
ardent optimists had hoped for. The 35-40 hour corridor for the working
week, more leeway from bargaining at company level, and lower wages for
long-term unemployed re-entering the labour market are among the
achievements.
Even IG Metall, once the most powerful union in the non-communist world, has
yielded a lot. It may still try to fight a lamentable rearguard action
against the trend. But if it indeed took an open conflict to clear the way
for a more flexible and efficient labour market, the economy should emerge
stronger rather than weaker from it - apart, of course, from a short-term
dip in a quarterly gross domestic product growth rate. And even if, for
whatever reason, the final settlement in metal engineering would not deliver
the needed extra flexibility, the change would most likely come about
nonetheless.
The present stream of companies leaving the employers' association and
striking their own tailor-made deals with the workforce would probably swell
to a flood, making the outdated central bargaining ritual more and more
obsolete.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need for subsidies will threaten rail
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having been one of the few national newspapers actively supporting
railway privatisation, the Financial Times can hardly complain if it doesn't
like the way it is turning out ('Selling the railways', February 21).
Far from the new track charges meaning that 'fewer of the franchises will be
profitable without public subsidy', they mean that 23 out of the 24 are
already loss-making. The exception, to no-one's surprise, is Gatwick
Express.
I say already because the new train leasing charges have yet to be
announced. I calculate that these will add a further Pounds 600m to
operating costs.
Thus, not only will all franchises have to be subsidised, they will have to
be heavily subsidised. And while, as you point out, it is a money
merry-go-round, the grant needed to get the merry-go-round turning will be
more than over Pounds 2bn, roughly double the present Public Service
Obligation (PSO).
This perceived doubling of railway subsidies must present a serious threat
to the future stability of the network since it suggests that railways are
an irredeemably inefficient form of transport, reinforcing existing
prejudices in certain quarters of Whitehall.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of share options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C W DAWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Whatever views one may hold about share option schemes, one thing
should be made clear. They are not costing large amounts of lost tax - quite
the opposite.
Most directors who exercise high-value share options will sell the shares
immediately. So the director who realises a gain of Pounds 1m will be
subject to 40 per cent capital gains tax on virtually all the gain, just as
he would have paid 40 per cent income tax on a Pounds 1m bonus.
The director's gain is the company's loss. The shareholders will lose value
of Pounds 1m just as surely as if the company had paid a bonus of the same
amount to the director. The vital difference is that the bonus payment earns
a corporation tax recovery of Pounds 330,000, making a net cost of Pounds
670,000, whereas the cost deriving from the share option gets no such
relief. So share options are a much more expensive way of delivering value
to directors than cash bonus schemes. The only reason share option schemes
persist is because the cost to shareholders does not appear in the profit
and loss account, or indeed anywhere else in the accounts, and it is only
through the newspapers that some of the largest figures are revealed.
If shareholders really appreciated what share option schemes are costing
them, particularly in terms of extra tax, they would close the schemes
overnight and replace them with cash bonus schemes.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Buskers' timid tune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott is one of Labour's few assets. Unfettered by the
conventions of the English language, the party's spokesman on employment
(and would-be deputy leader) manages to convey more with his unique syntax
than does, say, Mr Gordon Brown, whose anxious blending of cliche with
buzz-word, sound-bite with jargon, dark warning with sweeping intimation,
can make it tedious to unearth his meaning. This observation applies only to
recent ponderous examples of the shadow chancellor's written prose. He can
be very funny in the House of Commons. Face-to-face, he is crystal clear. On
TV, however, he is less than a barrel of laughs. Mr Prescott scores higher
on most counts, although some of his spoken sentences are difficult to
parse. Even Mr Robin Cook, with his wizard's beard, rapid-fire brain and
rapid-fire mouth, is not quite so engaging as the garrulous shadow
employment secretary.
Why, it may be asked, do we need to bother with any of these three
gentlemen? Is Labour not intellectually dormant? One answer is that in 1996,
which is only two tax increases away, they may be senior members of a Labour
cabinet. Another is that their names appear on Financing Infrastructure
Investment, a consultative paper published yesterday.
A warning is necessary here. The apparently tripartite authorship is a
consequence of brotherly turf-sharing in the shadow cabinet. The names
Brown, Cook, Prescott appear in order of seniority. The closely-argued
paper, which is mainly about the technicalities of public-private finance,
was three-quarters prepared in Mr Prescott's office. He has been propounding
the central thrust of it for some five years. The quality of the finished
product invites us to suspend our disbelief in the possibility that anything
worth arguing about can be produced by Britain's principal political
parties.
Do not be misled by the use of that word 'quality'. Everything is relative.
In the empty auditorium of British political debate we must be grateful for
whatever busking turns up to offer us enlightenment. These three are busking
more interestingly this week than for some time past. That's all. Although
there is much talk about promoting a partnership between business and the
state, the Prescott et al thesis does not constitute a new economic theory,
a substitute for socialism, a repackaged form of capitalism, or even a
storyline that might give waverers a positive incentive to vote Labour. It
simply ignores old-style nationalisation and looks instead at the
practicalities of bringing private capital into public initiatives. It does
so with a sharper eye than the Treasury will currently permit. At its best,
it outflanks the Tories on the right, which is what an opposition party
should do.
The cynical might dismiss the exercise as another episode in Labour's
perpetual search for off-balance sheet financing, a piece of hocus-pocus to
dodge the tax consequences of the party's high-spending intent, an
opportunistic bid for votes for a less tatty Britain. It is not quite so
obvious as that. For example, it proposes the sale of regulatory
restrictions. This implies that, say, Oftel's grip on BT might be eased in
exchange for an undertaking to develop a fibre-optic network. Of course
there is some chicanery in this. There is no intimation that the price might
be paid in higher call charges. We are, remember, talking about a political
document.
More down-to-earth sections seek to remove what the paper calls 'obstacles
to partnerships between public and private sectors'. Take the Treasury rule
that where the taxpayer assumes all the risk, the private partner cannot
expect all the rewards. Labour, you will be relieved to hear, agrees. The
rule has, however, prevented the conception, let alone the birth, of many a
public-private joint venture. The answer is to redefine risk. The state
might insure investors against events over which it has control, such as
changes in the law, the sudden imposition of safety codes or ministerial
bumbling. The private partner could absorb the risk associated with design,
efficiency, cost and late completion. Such a compromise might have
facilitated an earlier start to the channel tunnel rail link, more cheaply
than will now be the case.
Another disincentive to bringing in private money is the low rate of return
likely under existing rules. A leading article in Monday's Financial Times
pointed out that the Treasury insistence that Railtrack should budget for a
5.6 per cent return on its assets, rising to 8 per cent in four years,
constitutes an excessively tight target. The consequent charges for using
the rail network reduces the attractiveness of investment in rail
operations. The Prescott-plus paper says that 8 per cent was set for all
projects by Mr John Major in 1989, when he was chief secretary to the
Treasury. It is now higher than the average real rate of return on private
non-oil assets. Nervously Labour's paper suggests 're-opening this issue'.
The authors are just as timid, and with more reason, when they propose a
redefinition of the public sector borrowing requirement. The convention in
continental Europe, says the paper, is to treat publicly-owned activities
that earn a market return differently from those that do not. This
suggestion for writing-down the PSBR is no more infamous than the dozens of
writings-down of the level of unemployment by the Conservatives. It is
supported by the convergence criteria set in the Maastricht treaty. 'We are
consulting on this,' say our bold, radical authors.
The principal source of these tentative suggestions is, remember, associated
with the left of the party. Mr Prescott's antecedents come through, sotto
voce, in the paper's affirmation that projects should be initiated and led
by the government, which should set priorities. Regional investment banks
are still in the mix. There is no acknowledgement of the Concorde factor,
namely that colossal waste can result from decisions by officials. On the
contrary the private sector is regarded as equally prone to error. There is
material enough for the Conservatives to tear to shreds. The problem is that
their own 'private finance initiative' is initiating very little. Perhaps
that is why Sir Alastair Morton, brought in to revitalise it, will address
Labour's symposium on Thursday. The co-chairman of Eurotunnel can tell them
about financing the link.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: Progress out of chaos - America's
high-tech industry is in the lead again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The much-trumpeted revival of US manufacturing in the 1990s, though patchy,
seems beyond dispute in one vital area. In high-tech electronics, especially
the converging worlds of computing and telecommunications, the US has
reasserted its dominance in the past three years.
Some would say America's lead here was never really in doubt. But in the
mid-1980s, it seemed to be narrowing. At one end of the chain, the US
consumer electronics industry was in a nosedive. Further up, the Japanese
were taking over the production of semiconductor memory chips. At the top of
the chain, and perhaps most worrying from a strategic viewpoint, the US was
rapidly losing ground in the market for the highly sophisticated equipment
needed to manufacture semiconductor chips.
Now, while the US has ceded the manufacture of low-profit-margin, commodity
electronics products such as memory chips and television sets, it is racing
ahead in many aspects of information technology.
US companies dominate such critical areas as microprocessor chips, computer
software and personal computers. There has even been a comeback in machines
for making semiconductors. The leading US supplier, Applied Materials of
California, now claims to be the biggest in the world.
For once, the revival is not just a function of the shrinking Japanese
economy and the strength of the yen. The electronics industry is seeing
shifts in technology and markets which play to America's strengths, just as
the 1980s exposed its weaknesses.
In information technology, runs the argument, the US has three basic
advantages:
Communications. Competition in long-distance telephone services and the
growing freedom of the regional 'Baby Bells', created by the break-up of
AT&amp;T in the early 1980s, have encouraged innovation in US
telecommunications, producing lower-cost, more advanced telephone services.
At the same time, the American talent for entertainment - especially TV and
video - has produced explosive demand for cable television networks. As a
result, the spread and variety of electronic links between US offices,
factories and homes is a long way ahead of Japan.
Use of personal computers. The vast majority of US offices are equipped with
networked PCs. About one-third of US households also have at least one PC.
Japan by comparison has been slow to take advantage of PC technology.
The enterprise culture. California's Silicon Valley is still characterised
by a diversity of start-up companies, underpinned by a powerful and
sophisticated venture capital industry.
On the basis of these advantages, the US is racing to build broadband
networks, able to convey interactive media, which link homes, offices,
schools and hospitals. The Clinton administration has called the development
of such an 'information super-highway' a national goal.
Industry leaders claim the super-highway will not only create markets for
their inventions, but change the world, or at least the US. 'Sceptics may
disagree, but I believe the impact of this revolution will rival that of the
electric light or the telephone or, perhaps, printing itself,' says Larry
Ellison, president and chief executive of Oracle, a leading US database
software company.
The confidence that imbues the US industry is in contrast to the defeatism
of the late 1980s. There are still exceptions, such as International
Business Machines and Digital Equipment, the two largest computer companies,
which are struggling to adapt to shifts in technology and markets. As a
whole, though, the sector has turned itself round.
In personal computers, the US was bracing itself in the 1980s for a Japanese
invasion. The Japanese had captured the semiconductor market, it was said,
and their next target would be PCs. The reverse has happened: US PC
manufacturers are making inroads in the Japanese market.
One reason is the pace of technology change. 'The big players in the Far
East used to think all they had to do was fill a boat with cheap products
and send it here,' says Safi Qureshey, head of AST Research of California,
the world's fourth-biggest personal computer maker. 'Now it turns out that,
by the time the stuff lands here, it's a little bit slow, a little bit old,
and they can't sell it at a profit.'
Some Silicon Valley executives say the pace of change also favours US
entrepreneurial companies in a more fundamental way. Harvey Jones, head of
the software company Synopsys, argues the electronics industry alternates
between two phases: that of innovation, or chaos, and that of production, or
standardisation.
At present, he says, the industry is going through a chaotic upheaval. In
telecoms, he says, 'we have Ericsson, Alcatel, Siemens, NEC, Fujitsu and
AT&amp;T as customers. When we see them all in frenzied mode after God knows how
many telecom strategies, you say to yourself that we're in a huge cycle of
innovation. The same is true in multimedia. It's all pre-standardisation,
and all creative invention.'
This is the phase in which US-style creative diversity wins over the
large-scale, straight-line approach of the Japanese giants. Take the initial
innovative stage of semiconductors, says Jones. 'That was a phase when
companies like Intel and Fairchild could do no wrong. Then, as it settled
down, people said 'hey, a memory's a memory, and it's got to fit into this
one kind of socket on the board'. Then, all of a sudden, the Japanese came
in and took over.'
This does not mean that the US is doomed to lose its high-tech edge again.
US companies are more aggressive today in protecting their intellectual
property rights. Semiconductor manufacturers demand higher royalties on
their patents, and software companies vigorously enforce their copyrights.
Thus it will be more difficult for any foreign competitor to take advantage
of Intel's latest microprocessor innovations than it was for Japan's
chipmakers to become leaders in the market for the dynamic random access
memory chips, which Intel also invented.
Through international alliances, US companies are also taking advantage of
low-cost mass production abroad - in Taiwan, China, Singapore and Malaysia,
for example. Even though the majority of circuit boards for PCs are made
outside the US, American companies win most of the profits in the world PC
market.
The biggest advantage for US high-tech manufacturers, however, is that
technology trends are being set in their home market. This has long been the
case in computer hardware and software, but it is increasingly true of
telecommunications and even consumer electronics. Most important, the US
leads the world in working out how these technologies converge.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: The New Menoza - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a theatrical oddity well worth making the journey to Notting Hill
Gate to explore. This translation by Meredith Oakes of Jakob Lenz's The New
Menoza was commissioned by the Gate Theatre and first performed last year at
the Edinburgh Festival where it received appreciative notices. Now it has
been re-staged and inaugurates a season of 18th century comedy at the Gate's
newly furbished headquarters.
Lenz was a friend of Goethe's whom he met in Strasbourg in 1770 when as a
theologian from Livonia (now Latvia) he formed part of a brilliant circle of
writers. They largely initiated the Storm and Stress movement. In their case
this meant not merely a subversive life-style in reaction to teutonic
autocracy but the attempt to vitalise the resources of the German language
for literature, especially the theatre.
Lenz's plays revealed the strength of German prose as a dramatic medium.
Apart from The New Menoza, the other two outstanding ones are The Soldiers
and The Tutor (all available in English from Oberon Books, N7 9RH).
Based in Strasbourg the group were conscious of French dramatic doctrine as
much as they admired Shakespeare. Lenz the playwright derives from both
traditions. This play ends with the Mayor of Naumberg denouncing the
classical unities - one of three stunning cameo performances given by Tom
Chadbon during the evening - to his languidly decadent son (Pearce Quigley),
a bored upholder of them.
The director/ designer David Fielding might have been tempted to cut this
scene. At first it seemed an anti-climax after the high-spots of the masked
ball and violent bloodbath, that preceded it, both most ingeniously staged;
but on reflection it emerges as the key to the play. Through an absurdly
complicated plot centering on the arrival in Naumberg of a mysterious Prince
of Arabia (Peter Lindford), Lenz takes up motifs such as mistaken paternity
and forced marriage that are the stuff of classical theatre and one after
another he deconstructs them.
The problem is to prevent the whole thing degenerating into a sorry farce.
But, miraculously in this excellent production, it is avoided thanks to the
definition given to their roles by the 10-strong company, lifting them right
out of the stereotypes. The play explodes like a well-organised display of
fireworks through the formidable energy with which the actors attack it in
the limited space at their disposal. Tristam Jellinek leads the way as the
bumbling pater familias whose nubile daughter (Amanda Royle) the men all
covet, and everyone else gloriously follows suit. Not to be missed.
At the Gate Theatre until March 19.

Producer David Munro and reporter John Pilger (who made the memorable
Cambodia Year Zero) entered East Timor as tourists and shot secretly on
camcorders to make tonight's extended Network First documentary (10.40 ITV).
Then they had to smuggle the tapes out.
More than 200,000 people are said to have died since Indonesia invaded East
Timor in 1975. Munro and Pilger have investigated a mass killing at a
cemetery in 1991 and especially the subsequent events: it seems that
survivors were tracked down and killed, even those in hospital.
Given the number of impressive actors around, it is not clear why Oliver
Reed was chosen as the subject of the spoof obituary slot on Without Walls
(9.00 C4). A better idea is the item in which writer Paul Bailey accuses
'celebrity chefs' of promoting 'cuisine elitism' (9.30).
With reference to crime in general and the James Bulger murder in
particular, 40 Minutes asks 'Why blame the mother?' (9.50 BBC2). Omnibus
looks at the work of Damien Hirst (10.25 BBC1).

FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: Swiss put Massenet on the European opera circuit - A
new production of 'Thais' in St Gallen reveals the opera to be a parable of
self-discovery, at once noble and tragic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain may be enjoying a Massenet revival, but German-speaking Europe
remains impervious to his charms. Massenet's music is too pretty to appeal
to German taste. His romantic subjects lack the psychological breadth on
which the German opera world thrives. Massenet was, quite simply, the most
un-German composer of his time.
Now comes a revelatory production of Thais in eastern Switzerland to
challenge all those assumptions. It has been mounted by the St Gallen city
theatre exactly 100 years after the work's premiere, and is the first Thais
to be staged in German-speaking Europe. The opera emerges as a sensuous,
sensitive duo-drama, a conveyor of potent human truths, an example of
theatre musical at its bravest and least sentimental.
The tale of a prostitute finding God and a monk who succumbs to carnal lust
is an open invitation to kitsch - or to the kind of crude sexual imagery in
which German theatre abounds. The Austrian producer Franz Winter, with
Hans-Martin Scholder (decor) and Eva-Maria Dessecker (costumes), avoids both
extremes, finding instead a parable of self-discovery, at once noble and
tragic.
The performance unfolds between two white walls, supplemented where
necessary by a transparent curtain or a simple prop. The Egyptian setting is
captured by the lighting and by the mildly exotic costumes, more colonial
than early Christian. But the opera's decorative potential is deliberately
underplayed in order to enhance the psychological insights. With no breaks
for scene changes (and no ballet), the production mirrors two contrasting
sides of the human condition - spiritual frugality and worldly hedonism -
with a seamlessness reflected in Massenet's score.
St Gallen deserves credit for finding a near-ideal Thais and Athanael. The
Greek soprano Jenny Drivala achieves the transition from sinner to saint
with lifelike conviction. For the first part of the evening she is very much
the femme fatale. Her costume and body language match the erotic and fragile
quality of the music, while her spartan demeanour in the final act is
exactly right.
In between comes Thais's conversion. Here Winter introduces a non-singing
extra - a black chambermaid-cum-confidante - who provides a private audience
for Thas's aria, before stripping her, bathing her and gently, comfortingly
embracing her to the accompaniment of the famous Meditation. This intimate
scene achieves its impact by power of suggestion, rather than fully-frontal
nudity, and is mesmerising.
Miss Drivala not only has a figure most prima donnas would kill for, but
enough high-wire courage and musical intelligence to make the part her own.
The voice has a delicate, intense quality, neither big nor sumptuous. She is
partnered by the young American baritone Philip Zawisza, whose warm timbre
and more-than-acceptable French are a boon to Massenet's vocal lines. His
acting is equally convincing, notably in the way his Jimmy Swaggart-like
zeal turns into sexual obsession.
The musical quality is underpinned by Patrick Fournillier, the French
conductor who played a key part in the success of WNO's recent Cendrillon.
He allows the singers to be heard above Massenet's large orchestra and -
despite the undernourished St Gallen strings - negotiates the delicate
harmonic progressions, soft melodic contours and instrumental colouring with
complete stylistic assurance.
The entry on Thais in New Grove concludes that 'it is, in many ways, an
opera still awaiting its first serious production'. In the unlikely setting
of St Gallen, that landmark has surely been reached.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: La Damnation de Faust - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are problems in trying to attract the top international conductors to
London. Many of them are exceedingly expensive and, even if they can be
lured to come, only want to conduct works that they have either just
recorded or are taking with them around the world's capitals.
Nevertheless, if a London orchestra wants to look competitive against its
rivals, it has to enter the fray. The Philharmonia has been striving to put
together a distinctive line-up of conductors, among whom the successor to
its Music Director Sinopoli (still not announced) will clearly be the most
important. The prestigious new arrival on its list is James Levine, a
high-profile figure in New York, Bayreuth and Salzburg, but not seen in
front of a London orchestra for several decades.
His return was well handled. By scheduling a series of three programmes the
Philharmonia made sure that the concerts could be marketed to best advantage
(there were queues for returns) while also giving an overview of Levine's
musical sympathies. The Beethoven and Mahler concerts met with mixed
opinions; by all accounts the best - a performance of Berlioz's La Damnation
de Faust - was left until last.
It seems no coincidence that Levine has had his biggest successes in the
opera-house. The Berlioz may not be an opera (even though it was recently
staged at Covent Garden) but it calls for an opera-conductor's sense of
atmosphere and pacing. Levine succeeded in providing most of that and took
care over every bar, not just the showpiece orchestral numbers.
In his hands the work aspired to grand opera status, which was clearly
intentional, as Levine had brought with him a heroic Faust in Gary Lakes.
Perhaps Faust's Invocation to Nature does call for a grandeur of utterance,
but it would take the devil himself to get a voice of this size to sing with
the flexibility that most of Berlioz's music presupposes. Maria Ewing
brought inner intensity to Marguerite's solos; Roderick Earle made a lively
impact as Brander. Jose van Dam sang a wickedly subtle Mephistopheles,
suave, ingratiating, diabolic, making every word of the French text count.
Only a couple of years ago the Philharmonia put on La Damnation de Faust
with Charles Dutoit - not such a high-class performance as this, but it did
exhibit a sense of French style that is not in Levine's bones. Where he
gained the upper hand was in the standard of singing which he obtained from
the Philharmonia Chorus and, above all, the quality of ensemble from the
orchestra. This was an evening when the Philharmonia sounded confident of
its place in the international league.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: Feats of clay - When does a work of craft become a
work of art? William Packer meets the problem head on in 'The Raw and the
Cooked'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate between the Fine and the Applied Arts is an old and hoary
controversy. In the Victoria &amp; Albert or the British Museum we have little
difficulty in taking Renaissance gold and silver, Chinese porcelain or
Celtic jewellery as true art, singular and beautiful in the particular
marriage of the aesthetic with the practical. Going round a workshop or
exhibition of contemporary craft, we are not so sure.
Objet d'art remains ambiguous and faintly patronising a designation. When,
quite, does a work of conventional craft transcend itself to become a work
of art? Might it not be a work of art in any case, its transcendence quite
unnecessary? Taking new work in clay in Britain as its material subject, The
Raw and the Cooked, shown at the Barbican before Christmas and now at
Oxford, tackles the issue head-on by the simple expedient of ignoring it.
That it should come up with no answer is merely to double the irony.
Clay is, or rather was, quite as much the staple of the sculptor's as of the
potter's practice, flexible and convenient, yet oddly neglected by sculptors
in our century. So it was that 32 assorted sculptors and ceramists were
invited to show examples of current work, which are here set up to take
their chances indifferently alongside each other, without benefit of
category or caveat.
The result is intriguing and often delightful in the particular, but
frustrating overall. The most directly successful and impressive are those
exhibitors who are simply getting on with what we know they do, continuing
to develop in their work, and doing it very well. They all fall on the craft
side. Such exhibitors as Elizabeth Fritsch, Ken Eastman, Carol McNicol and
Alison Britton may all be making pots that have a decidedly sculptural
quality to them, but pots nevertheless.
Least satisfactory are the acknowledged sculptors, whether showing sculpture
as such or decorated pots. Antony Gormley's procession of pinched and blobby
mannikins, receding to infinity, is merely silly, the more so for the vast
space it neutralises. Tony Cragg's solid jar-and-bottle forms in rough clay,
sliced like loaves, are no more than a perfunctory exercise. Bruce McLean
has thrown a pot together, and thrown an image onto it. He speaks of an
elegance that could be there, if only he gave it a moment to catch its
balance. All three artists seem self-conscious, as though to say: here is
the chance to make a point, say something significant, do something special.
And in between falls the majority, craftsmen by discipline but easing
themselves into no-man's-land in the direction of sculpture, producing work
that is distinguished in itself but which confronts the issue they know will
never be resolved. Gordon Baldwin's ceramic objects, Ewan Henderson's more
roughly sophisticated totems, Jacqueline Poncelet's quirky fetishes, Susan
Halls's raku beasts like trophies hung in the ancestral hall, Philip Eglin's
Madonna and Child - all are authentic and convincing in themselves,
beautiful and intriguing. I was particularly taken by Tracey Heyes's
stoneware disembodied dresses, active figures without the figure itself.
Do these makers all yet accept in their hearts that the old distinction is
not to be denied; that what they do is something more than craft, and less
than art? It is the very question, perhaps, that is mistaken, and less and
more have little to do with it. What this show makes clear is that the
integrity of what is done is what matters, and that the tired question of
relative status, artist or craftsmen, neither here nor there. Whatever he
does, an artist is an artist if he is an artist: it is as simple as that.
All very easy to say, of course, but it takes little account of the market
and general prejudice and perception. Why should a drawing, pencil on paper,
command more, as a matter of course, than a pot? Answer: because it does.
Even so, the Fine Crafts in Britain consistently offer us work across the
full range of disciplines that is second to none in the world. Its
originality and quality, both technical and aesthetic, speak for themselves
whenever such work is shown, but its economic success is less well
celebrated. The fact is that the Fine Crafts collectively make a financial
contribution within the small business sector of the national economy that
is quite disproportionate to its size. That this should be so is in part due
to the efforts of the Crafts Council, founded some 20 years ago precisely to
foster and promote such activity  - and it is sad to see that success still
so often ignorantly disparaged, as it was by ITN's News at Ten some weeks
ago in one of its special reports on government quangos.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Bauman, recently appointed non-executive chairman of British Aerospace,
is also finding time to go on the board of Russell Reynolds, one of the
largest international headhunting companies.
Russell Reynolds, which is headquartered in New York but has now established
more than half its 24 offices outside America, has been taking steps to
'internationalise' its board. Though Bauman is an American citizen, he moved
to London in 1986 to take up the post of chairman and chief executive of
Beecham Group. Since then he earned high marks for piloting the merger with
SmithKline Beckman, and become one of the UK's highest paid directors.
It was Russell Reynolds who brought Bauman, then vice chairman of Textron,
across the Atlantic. Jane Kingsley, a London-based managing director at the
headhunting company, says that when Bauman announced he would be retiring
from SKB it would have been 'a completely natural conversation' to ask him
if he wanted to come aboard the headhunting firm, which is still retained by
SKB. She would not elaborate further on the timing of his decision. He is
also a non-executive director of Reuters, CIGNA, Union Pacific Corporation
and Capital City/ABC.
The board meets 'three or four times a year', Kingsley adds, 'but is mainly
there to give advice, so he will receive many, many phone calls.'
Other members of the board include John Loudon, the retired chairman of
Royal Dutch Shell, and Philip Caldwell, the former chairman and chief
executive of Ford Motor Company. The company hopes to bring in a British
director in the next few months.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Strings attached to contracting out -
It is not clear whether employee rights legislation applies to UK
public-sector policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the UK government thought that by opting out of the social chapter of the
Maastricht agreement it could wave goodbye to European interference with UK
employment rights, it has had to think again. Its flagship policy on
contracting out public sector services has been thrown into confusion by the
impact of the European Acquired Rights Directive.
The directive, which was translated into UK law by the 1981 Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE), has a simple
purpose: to protect the jobs and conditions of employees when the
undertaking they work for changes hands. New employers must take over
existing contracts of employment, consult with unions and honour collective
agreements.
In theory, the impact of the 1977 directive ought to be clear by now. In
reality, it is not. After almost 15 years of virtually trouble-free
operation, there is widespread uncertainty over its application. The problem
is particularly acute in the UK, where doubts over whether TUPE extends to
compulsory competitive tendering and market testing mean that the
government's policy on these matters is said to be in danger of collapse.
Given that the profitability of public sector contracts often depends on the
contractor trimming employment costs by cutting jobs and reducing the pay of
those transferred, it is hardly surprising that contractors have become wary
of the contracting-out process. But why has TUPE suddenly become such a
problem?
Until recently, it had been assumed, in the UK at least, that the 1977
directive applied only where there was a merger, acquisition or takeover of
a commercial venture. This interpretation, which would have ruled out the
directive's application to the contracting out of services with a purely
social or public purpose, was reflected in the 1981 regulations by excluding
their application to 'any undertaking which is not in the nature of a
commercial venture'.
But in 1992, the European Court of Justice ruled in a case called Dr Sophie
Redmond that the Acquired Rights Directive could apply to undertakings that
were not purely commercial in nature.
Recognising that TUPE was incompatible with European law, and faced with
infraction proceedings by the European Commission, the UK government last
August bowed to the inevitable - using the 1993 Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Act to remove the offending words from TUPE. But while the
act leaves no room for doubt that TUPE can apply to the contracting out of
services - something that had been recognised since the Sophie Redmond
decision - the question of whether or not it applies in any particular case
remains uncertain.
The uncertainty has not been helped by a number of conflicting court
decisions. The approach of the ECJ in Luxembourg is that the directive is
capable of broad application. In the 1993 Rask case, which involved the
contracting out of a staff canteen by Philips, the Dutch electronics
company, the ECJ ruled that the Acquired Rights Directive could apply where
an employer assigned to an outside contractor the responsibility of managing
an in-house service. For the directive to apply, two conditions had to be
met. The service had to form an identifiable part of the employer's
operations, and it had to retain its identity after transfer.
The ECJ's guidance was followed by the English Employment Appeal Tribunal
last July in the case of Wren v Eastbourne Borough Council, which involved
the contracting out of the council's refuse collection services. The appeal
tribunal said a mere transfer of services could fall within the scope of the
regulations but, to the disappointment of all who had hoped the case would
settle the issue of whether TUPE applied to compulsory competitive
tendering, it referred back to the industrial tribunal the question of
whether the contracting out of refuse services amounted to a transfer of an
undertaking.
The European Court's broad approach was also followed by the English High
Court last summer in Kenny v Woodroffe, where it said TUPE applied to the
transfer of prison education services from a local authority to a local
further education college.
But in August, this trend towards a broad application of TUPE by the English
courts was reversed by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the Dines case,
causing fresh confusion. The appeal tribunal upheld an industrial tribunal
ruling that there was no transfer when the contract for cleaning Orsett
Hospital in Essex came to an end and a new contract was awarded to a
different contractor. The Dines case goes to the appeal court in June.
To add to the uncertainty faced by contractors, the government's line on the
application of TUPE to contracting out has been inconsistent. Two years ago
the government advised contractors to bid for contracts on the basis that
TUPE applied. Now the government says it is up to contractors to decide
whether it applies or not.
This is causing big problems for contractors, according to Mr Cliff
Davis-Coleman of the CDC Research company specialising in local authority
contracts. Mr Davis-Coleman, who founded the TUPE lobbying group, Clause 26
(named after a clause in the 1988 Local Government Act), says contractors
are in an impossible situation. They are unsure whether to allow for the
costs of TUPE when they tender, so perhaps submitting a bid far higher than
their rivals; to bid on the basis TUPE does not apply, and risk being taken
to court by employees if they win the contract; or to submit two bids.
By September, contractors were so confused that a survey among Clause 26
members suggested that contracting out had virtually come to a standstill.
Since then, however, the situation has improved.
Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose, believes that
contractors and local authorities are beginning to come to terms with the
fact that the initial contracting out of public services is a transfer for
TUPE purposes.
Guidance from the Department of Environment published last month has
clarified the circumstances in which contractors and local authorities can
seek indemnities from each other for unexpected TUPE costs. And a body of
industrial tribunal decisions on the application of TUPE to the contracting
out of different types of services is beginning to bring some certainty to
first-round tenders between private contractors and local authorities.
But problems remain. In particular, the question of whether TUPE protects
pension rights and obliges contractors to provide 'comparable' pension
provisions is causing concern, she says. The Court of Appeal will examine
this issue in the summer in the Warrener case.
Whether or not TUPE extends to pension rights may be irrelevant in the long
term: the Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, has made clear that the
government believes pension rights are protected by general employment law.
If a new employer fails to provide comparable pension provision, employees
may treat themselves as constructively dismissed and sue, he says. If the
appeal court decides in Warrener that TUPE does not cover pensions,
contractors may wish to challenge the attorney general's view, Ms Tether
says, because it would be a substantial competitive advantage to contractors
if they did not have to provide comparable pension provisions.
There is also still much confusion over the application of TUPE to
second-round tenders, where one contractor is taking over from another. The
uncertainty in this area, epitomised by the Dines case, is also affecting
the outsourcing of services in the private sector.
According to Mr Ira Chalphin, employment research executive at the Institute
of Directors, companies wanting to restructure and concentrate on their core
businesses are concerned by the cost implications of TUPE. The IoD wants the
UK government to put pressure on Brussels to limit the application of the
Acquired Rights Directive to mergers and acquisitions. The directive is
under review by the Commission at the moment.
The IoD is also hoping the European Court of Justice will take the
opportunity of the forthcoming Schmidt case, which involves the transfer of
a cleaner employed by a German bank to a private contractor, to limit or
reverse its view of the scope of the directive which it adopted in the Rask
case.
Lawyers, however, remain doubtful. According to Ms Tether, the European
Court is unlikely to break new ground in the Schmidt case. People say this
is an important test case because it involves only one person, she says. But
the Rask case involved the transfer of only a handful of staff, and Schmidt
essentially raises the same point.
She also has doubts about the government's chances of persuading the other
member states to limit the scope of the directive. 'Any change requires
unanimity within the Council (of Ministers). I'd be very surprised if they
get what they are looking for,' she says.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Safeguards on enforcement - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court has ruled that German civil procedure rules infringe
Community law in permiting a temporary property attachment order to be
issued on the sole ground that a judgment will have to be enforced in
another member country.
The Court said such national procedural rules infringe the principles of a
single market for judgments under the Brussels Convention on Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments. In particular, national enforcement rules which
differ depending on whether a judgment is ultimately to be enforced within
the domestic jurisdiction or in another member country are precluded by the
prohibition of discrimination in the Rome treaty when read together with the
Brussels Convention.
The ECJ gave its ruling in response to a question referred to it by the
Hanseatic Oberlandesgericht of Hamburg. The question arose in the context of
litigation between a German Company, Mund &amp; Fester, and Hatrex, the
international transport firm.
Hatrex had transported a consignment of nuts from Turkey which had been
damaged in transit. Mund &amp; Fester sued Hatrex for damages and interest.
Since Hatrex was based in the Netherlands, Mund &amp; Fester also applied to the
Hamburg court for a property attachment order against the truck belonging to
Hatrex used to transport the nuts. The truck was still in Germany.
The German rules on property attachment orders provided that an order may be
made in the context of a judgment to be enforced within the national
jurisdiction only when it is likely that, without the order, enforcement
would be impossible or fundamentally more difficult. Yet, when a judgment
would have to be enforced abroad, that was sufficient justification in
itself for an order.
The Hamburg court refused the order on the ground that the foreign
enforcement provision was inconsistent with the Brussels Convention in a
case where a member country was involved. Mund &amp; Fester appealed. They
claimed German rules on attachment orders were unaffected by the Brussels
Convention.
The Hamburg appeal court asked the ECJ to interpret the Brussels Convention
in these circumstances. The ECJ said the question effectively asked whether
the Rome treaty prohibition of discrimination on the ground of nationality
read together with the Convention precluded such rules which differ between
domestic and foreign judgments.
First, the ECJ determined that the German provisions came within the scope
of Community law. Since the Brussels Convention was based on article 220 of
the treaty which dealt with the recognition and enforcement of judgments,
national rules in that field are subject to relevant Community law.
Second, the Court said that the treaty prohibition of discrimination on the
ground of nationality prohibited all such discrimination in areas within the
scope of the treaty. Discrimination included disguised discrimination, which
took the form of applying different criteria which had the same result as
overt discrimination.
The Court ruled the national rules of civil procedure in question were a
form of disguised discrimination on the ground of nationality. Although the
rule did not exclusively prejudice foreigners, it was unlikely often to
apply to Germans.
Finally, the ECJ concluded the attachment order rules were contrary to the
Rome treaty's ban on discrimination since they could not be objectively
justified. According to the ECJ, the enforcement risks in all member
countries were no greater than in Germany because all are contracting
parties to the Brussels Convention. As indicated in the interpretative
report on the Brussels Convention, the territories of the contracting
parties can be considered as a single entity.

And Goldman's top brass, eternally grateful to 'Woody' for taking the bank

Sherwood will be back at his old haunt today and will be joined on the

FT  22 FEB 94 / People: Ken Inglis moves to Fleming
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why should Ken Inglis, chief-executive designate of Threadneedle Asset
Management, chuck up the opportunity of putting his mark on one of London's
biggest and newest firms of fund managers to join the old-fashioned Fleming
Investment Management group whose funds under management are noticeably
smaller?
Inglis, 50, trained as an actuary with Edinburgh-based Scottish Provident in
the early 1960s, and switched into investment management in 1972. In 1983 he
moved to London to head research at stockbrokers Phillips &amp; Drew and in 1990
returned to fund management as chief executive of Allied Dunbar Asset
Management.
Inglis portrays his latest move as natural career progression. Having worked
for a traditional Scottish life company, a big institutional broker, and the
fund management side of a 'highly successful' direct sales company, he was
tempted by the challenge of managing the investment arm of an
old-established merchant bank.
Robert Fleming, whose fund management business ranges from managing pension
funds to the Save &amp; Prosper unit trust operation, is one of the great names
in the investment business. However, its investment performance has not
always been up to scratch and industry-watchers believe that the decision to
bring in an outsider is an admission that it could do considerably better.
John Manser, Fleming's chief executive, describes Inglis as Fleming's 'chief
investment officer' and says his task will be to achieve Fleming's strategic
aim of becoming 'the best performing investment management business in the
UK'.
Inglis, who joins on June 1 as chairman of Fleming Investment Management,
replaces Iain Saunders, 46, who has done the job for four years. He has been
appointed deputy chairman of Robert Fleming Asset Management with 'a
business expansion brief'. (See Observer)

FT  22 FEB 94 / Management: Difference between a profit and a loss -
Exporting / A look at the benefits of export credit insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy enough to lose money by selling to a company in another town that
suddenly goes bust. Suppliers suffer this indignity every week, in spite of
increasingly sophisticated credit controls.
To lose money when a customer overseas fails is even easier. The culture,
language and local market are often relatively unknown to the new exporter.
So reducing the risk by using export credit insurance is the obvious answer.
Yet some exporters still claim it is expensive or unavailable in some parts
of the world. This view is partially endorsed by Howard Davis,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'There have been
some welcome improvements in cover and reductions in premiums,' says Davis.
'But in some markets UK support still compares unfavourably with that of the
competition.'
What is more, exporters say, the UK alone in the European Union does not
supply state reinsurance support for short-term export credit. The
government has extended 'transitional' cover until the end of 1997. This was
put in place when part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department was
privatised in 1991, but the lack of permanence is causing uncertainty.
According to the leading insurance providers, Dutch-owned NCM and Trade
Indemnity of the UK, about Pounds 25bn of a possible Pounds 35bn to Pounds
45bn of exports that could be insured is already benefitting from short-term
cover. How much greater, some exporters ask, could UK exports be if the
supply and cost of credit became easier?
For smaller companies that do find the cover they require, the management of
export insurance can still be difficult. 'The tricky thing for small
companies is the need for detailed administration of your policy,' says Ian
Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Exports.
While the rules are clear, cover is often rendered invalid by customers who
forget to provide details of transactions, exceed credit limits, deliver
goods outside agreed dates or fail to report payment delays.
Even experienced exporters often treat export credit insurance like a car
policy that can be bought and forgotten. 'You cannot buy a credit insurance
policy of any type and put it in the drawer and forget about it,' says
Barbara Bennett, corporate relations manager at Trade Indemnity. 'You have
to manage it alongside your credit controls.'
Unlike car insurance, which is only pulled out when needed, export credit
requires constant tinkering - changing credit limits, applying for new ones
and pruning those which are no longer needed - if the costs are to be
properly managed.
So where should new exporters turn for advice and cover? There are two
different forms of export credit insurance. Medium-term insurance covers
sales or large projects when payment is expected over a two-year period or
more.
It attracts a lot of attention - and the bulk of the government's
reinsurance through the official export credit insurer, the Export Credit
Guarantee Department. But only a small number of companies use this form of
cover.
About 85 per cent of credit insurance is short-term cover. Since 1991, when
the ECGD short-term insurance division was privatised, there have been two
dominant credit providers - NCM, which bought the short-term credit business
and is by far the largest, and the relative newcomer, Trade Indemnity. TI is
the largest domestic credit supplier and has also moved into the export
market.
Both companies in theory cover exporters against losses up to 90 per cent of
the value of invoices where a customer defaults, and up to 95 per cent if
the customer is willing to pay but the country defaults, as was the case
with Nigeria in 1983.
Unless they are very big, exporters should not take their business directly
to an insurer. The smallest exporters - with sales of Pounds 100,000 or less
 -may find more appropriate managed policies provided by Intrum Justitia,
CAD, part of the conglomerate BTR, or a limited number of banks. Here the
exporter becomes the joint holder of a policy  - often reinsured with NCM -
and can pay a lower premium than the insurer would have charged had it been
handling the business directly.
For larger exporters, it almost always pays to use a broker to approach the
insurers.
A good broker should be able to weed out classes of business that do not
require insurance - sales to an associate company in another country, for
example.
And they should help in claims and managing credit lines, an area that too
often receives little attention from exporters.
In spite of the need for careful management of export insurance, the case
for having it is irrefutable. A company earning 10 per cent profit margins,
for example, which has a bad debt of Pounds 100,000, would have to make
additional sales of Pounds 1m to make up the loss.
Insurers say they do more than just provide cover. They can steer exporters
towards or away from certain markets in addition to helping with the credit
control function.
'There are benefits of credit insurance alongside a company's own credit
management system,' says Colin Foxall, chief executive of NCM. 'There are
very few cases where it would not make sense for an exporter to take credit
insurance.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Management: Survival in a war of succession - Pruning the
family tree can avoid damaging intra-family company politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul O'Hea, managing director of Colt Group, is in an unusual position.
At 35 he is in charge of a thriving Hampshire-based maker of
air-conditioning and ventilation systems with sales of Pounds 92m and
manufacturing sites in three European countries.
He is also the third generation O'Hea to control Colt, which was founded by
his grandfather. This achievement grants the O'Heas membership of an
exclusive club of families whose companies have survived what is often a
debilitating war of succession.
The transition has apparently been seamless. Paul's uncle, Jerome O'Hea,
whom he succeeded at Christmas, has become chairman and moved his office to
his home; he promises to visit the company only once a fortnight. And Alan
O'Hea, Paul's father, who ran the business for 30 years after taking over
from founder Jack O'Hea when he was 32, is president and performs a largely
ambassadorial role.
But the O'Hea story is something of a rarity. There are, of course, other
examples of successful succession. The Hoare family has just introduced the
eleventh generation at the private London bank and Wates, the builders, is
now run by the grandson of the founder.
But like Colt, these are exceptions. According to Alden Lank, professor of
family enterprises at IMD, the Lausanne-based international management
school, only 15 per cent of family companies that manage to survive five
years are successfully passed on to a third generation.
'The problem of succession is the single most important reason for family
businesses not to continue over the long term,' Lank says. 'Families just
can't get their hands around this issue.'
A more typical story is that of GH Zeal, a south London manufacturer of
thermometers. Stephen Zeal, a graduate of the London Business School, says
Zeal is a 'very typical family business'.
'My father and uncle were the third generation entering a cash-rich business
in the 1950s with sufficient resources to compensate for mistakes made.'
When he joined in the late 1970s, the company had sales of about Pounds
3.5m. 'I came in as the fourth generation with lots of ideas, the eldest of
four boys,' says Zeal. But its traditional thermometer market started to
come under pressure from electronic products.
Declining sales meant a disproportionately large overhead became a
constraint on further development.
The company needed more cash but Stephen Zeal says his father and uncle
lacked enough confidence in the company's future to request extra resources
from the family.
'There was a slow and sluggish response to business demands,' Zeal says.
'The issue was the ability or inability of the family members to take timely
commercial decisions.' He left and set up his own company making electronic
temperature gauges.
As a result of the company's financial position, the family decided the only
way to secure value from the business - then only breaking even - was to
sell to a management buy-out, a decision Stephen Zeal deeply regrets.
'There was an in-house fight between myself and the older generation,' says
Zeal. 'The big problem was the family had run out of money and the company
had continued to decline.'
Zeal believes the problems were exacerbated because shareholdings were
dispersed between about 20 family members, via various trusts. As a result,
the executive directors lacked the motivation to take further personal
financial risk on behalf of the other members of the family, he says.
'If the family directors felt solely responsible for themselves and their
own shares then maybe a decision would have been taken to put further
security down to generate more cash,' says Zeal.
Lank says private companies in this situation need to anticipate such
problems by 'pruning the family tree'. To avoid intra-family politics that
can follow when no one member owns a significant stake, early action is
needed, he says.
In Colt's case Alan O'Hea's father did the first pruning. 'My father
recognised this very early on and set up a structure in 1959 of
discretionary trusts to hold Colt shares,' says Paul O'Hea. A second pruning
is under way with the company buying out the interests of the founder's two
daughters.
'We faced the fact that the family grows exponentially and the family
business does not,' says Jerome O'Hea. 'We realised it would not be possible
for Paul and his cousins to manage to sustain ever increasing numbers of
shareholders.'
Another option, if there are enough assets, is to split them between
offspring and disallow cross-directorships. The Swiss-based Schmidheiny
family, which has diversified industrial investments, took this route.
Alternatively, shares can be split into voting and non-voting shares so that
management control is entrusted to a smaller number of hands. 'If you are
worried about shareholders setting up coalitions your thinking time is spent
wondering how to manage the politics of the family,' says Lank.
Paul O'Hea is also convinced that a succession plan should be clearly
articulated. Colt announced Alan O'Hea's retirement date six years ago. And
Paul O'Hea is clear about how often he would like to see his uncle in the
office. 'IJ would turn up regularly,' says Paul O'Hea of Colt's founder,
Jack O'Hea. 'I get the impression it will be easier for me because we have
learned.'
Looking forward, Paul O'Hea realises the rights of those family members not
working for Colt is an issue he must tackle. For the first 30 years of
Colt's existence family members did not receive dividends. He recognises the
potential conflict between his interests, as a professional manager drawing
a salary and running a company car, and the desires of some of the
non-working family members to capitalise on their inheritance.
'I am in the business to keep it private and to grow it,' he says. 'My view
is we will go on pruning the family tree as long as the company can provide
the cash to do it.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: 'I marvel at how real the experience of flying
is'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'm in an unfamiliar living room with a large glass sliding door looking
out on to a garden. l notice a brilliant flash of light and I'm struck by
the thought that it is the flash of a nuclear explosion. I quickly run
behind a large sofa to protect myself from the coming shock wave of the
blast.
'l suddenly realise that the flash of light may be from the DreamLight mask
and so this must be a dream] I walk outside into the garden and try to fly.
It's a little awkward at first, but then I slowly rise. I marvel at how real
this experience of flying is. It's an exhilarating feeling flying over the
roof tops of surrounding houses. l fly into a forest and notice the deep
yellow sunlight filtering through the dark green foliage of the trees. I
begin to lose the dream and wake up.'
This was a lucid dream this writer had using the DreamLight system. While
the DreamLight helps to achieve lucid dream states, some preparation is
required.
First, dream recall must be increased. Some people claim never to dream, but
this is not true. Everyone has about four to seven dreams per night, but not
everyone remembers their dreams. It is possible to have lucid dreams and to
be unaware of the experience because dream recall is poor or non-existent.
Improving dream recall is achieved by keeping a journal of dreams. Upon
waking, the dream should be be written down, even if it is just a momentary
fragment. Waiting even just a few minutes to record a dream often results in
forgetting its details completely.
LaBerge discovered that since dream reality is so convincing, a reality
check must be made to answer the question: 'Is this a dream?'. Thus when
DreamLight users notice ordinary flashing lights during the day, they should
ask themselves this question.
'A reality check involves finding some writing, like on a banknote or a book
page. You read a couple of words, then look away. In a dream, the words will
have changed when you look at them again,' says LaBerge. 'For some reason,
while the dreaming human brain can model reality so convincingly, it cannot
maintain consistency with printed or written words.'
The DreamLight functions must also be adjusted for each user. Some
DreamLight users report that it is uncomfortable to wear the sleep mask and
that the flashing light wakes them. Other users say that they sleep through
the flashing lights and fail to see the signal.
But overall, experiments have shown that the DreamLight, when used with
supporting mental exercises, helps increase the number of lucid dreams by as
much as 500 per cent.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: Waking up to dream control - A look at an
alternative to virtual reality technology with vivid results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As computer companies strive to develop virtual reality systems, researchers
in California are working on technologies that allow people to tap into the
virtual (or sub-conscious) reality inside their heads - namely, dreams.
The Lucidity Institute, a private organisation founded in 1988 by Stephen
LaBerge, a Stanford University researcher, has developed computer-based
electronic devices and training programmes that teach people how to
experience lucid dreams. In these, the dreamers are aware of their dreams;
they can participate consciously in them and control them for specific
objectives.
The methods developed by the institute promise users such possibilities as
indulging in adventures and fantasies, refining skills, finding solutions to
difficult problems, overcoming nightmares and discovering methods of
healing.
Executives have used lucid dreams to rehearse difficult presentations,
surgeons have practised complex procedures, and classical musicians have
rehearsed difficult passages. In most cases, the skills perfected in the
lucid dream have been transferred to the waking state.
There are also important therapeutic applications. Physically handicapped
persons can regain total mobility within the lucid dream state, and there
are some indications that lucid dreams can help boost the body's immune
response and increase the rate of healing.
As yet, though, evidence of lucid dreams' impact is anecdotal. Some
researchers are sceptical about their value. Also, some psychotherapists who
use dreams to treat neuroses are unhappy about lucid dreams, regarding them
as an interference with the sub-conscious.
Lucid dreams certainly offer a more effective virtual reality than is
achieved by computer systems. In computer-based virtual reality, the user
interacts with a computer-generated world by wearing goggles containing tiny
computer screens and a special electronic glove that detects hand movements.
Such systems have a long way to go in mimicking waking reality; the computer
graphics resolution is poor and the systems are slow and very expensive. But
in the virtual reality of dreams, the dreamer experiences a world almost
indistinguishable from waking reality. While lucid dreams sometimes happen
spontaneously, they are fairly rare for most people. This is why researchers
at the institute concentrate on developing electronic biofeedback devices
and programmes that help people achieve lucid dreams on a regular basis.
The most sophisticated device is called the DreamLight. This is a small
computer about the size of a hardback book with a one-line liquid crystal
display and four control buttons. It is attached via a wire to a lightweight
sleep mask worn by the user. Sensors in the mask detect body and eye
movements and contain two tiny lights. When the DreamLight detects rapid eye
movements and no body movements, it knows that the user is dreaming. It will
then flash the lights in the sleep mask in a specific sequence.
In the dream, the DreamLight user sees the flashing lights incorporated in
some way, such as the sun rising and setting, or car headlights flashing.
The flashing lights act as a signal to the dreamer that he or she is
experiencing a dream. By maintaining a balance between staying within the
dream and not waking, the dreamer can experience a lucid dream lasting up to
45 minutes or more.
LaBerge is also a co-founder of the Stanford University Sleep Research
Center, one of the few large research centres into sleep and dreams. LaBerge
He and his colleagues began developing the DreamLight technology in 1985.
'The first prototype looked more like a prop in a bad 1950s science fiction
film,' says LaBerge. But despite its crude nature, experiments showed that
it worked well.
The institute further refined this technology and now offers not only the
Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 822) DreamLight but also a less expensive version, the
Dollars 275 NovaDreamer.
'The NovaDreamer has the potential to reach a very large market and help
introduce large numbers of people to lucid dreaming,' says Craig Webb, one
of the NovaDreamer developers.
Webb adds that the institute is looking for investors and distributors to
help market its technology to the large potential market. It says the
technology has widespread applications - the storage capacity, up to 10
days, of a subject's dream cycles can help diagnose and treat sleep
disorders without requiring lengthy and expensive visits to sleep
laboratories. The institute claims it can also be programmed to sound an
alarm during or before a dream - useful in treating people with recurring
nightmares.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: Africa's need to keep in touch - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMANUEL OHAJAH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To communicate with my sister Joyce in North Carolina is simple. l can
telephone from a public call box using a plastic card. l can send her a fax.
When l was a student, l would use electronic mail.
Soon, l will be able to talk to Joyce face-to-face, using the latest in
video-conferencing systems. We can share access to current real-time and
on-line communication systems, such as Internet.
To communicate with Esi, my uncle in Lagos, is much harder. Although Nigeria
is one of the most advanced African nations, communicating can be difficult.
Even in the most cosmopolitan places there can be problems. In April 1992,
the international phone service connecting the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and
Europe was down for nearly a week.
In fact, there is a distinct feeling of remoteness whenever I try to contact
my Nigerian relatives. Nigeria, like many developing countries, is not part
of the new communications order.
Along with many others in the west, I enjoy the latest in communications
technology. Most Nigerians, however, do not have easy access to a telephone
or computer - never mind the infrastructure of a modern global
communications network. In the west, the humble telephone is taken for
granted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use.
Cheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while
international rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people.
By comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive.
The other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution
is the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications
world; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African
context. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has
only 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages.
The 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the
world, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only
Internet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire
African continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national
telecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone
lines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does
not even feature.
At a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society,
there is a danger that the developing countries will become further
marginalised and impoverished.
In all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications
technology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect,
created a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the
developing countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to
be applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of
the developed nations.
Yet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an
essential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and
television were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations
between north and south.
The US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds
in developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are
eagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies,
Africa is largely an IT desert.
We are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'.
This is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the
gap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under
international investment programmes, could help to develop more modern
industries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to
help improve agricultural production.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (8):
New team attempts to generate fresh impetus - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new team led by Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, is attempting to
give a fresh impetus to Portugal's five-year-old privatisation programme,
recently one of the centre-right government's least successful ventures.
After buyers snapped up companies on offer in the finance sector, three big
privatisations launched last year failed.
Mr Antonio de Sousa, secretary of state for finance who took office last
December, said that his main priorities were to lift limits for foreigners;
achieve a wider distribution of shares; and a faster process, with one
privatisation a month.
The first failure last year was the planned joint sale of the cement
companies Secil-Cimentos Maceira e Pataias (CMP), for which the government
received no offer.
In the cases of the steel manufacturer Siderurgia Nacional (SN) and Banco
Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor (BPSM), the government rejected the offers, one in each
case, as too low. This meant that the state received a mere Es70bn from
privatisations in 1993, instead of the budgeted Es175bn, already revised
late in the year from the original Es225bn.
Up to 60 per cent of receipts from privatisations may be injected into
companies still state-held, while at least 40 per cent of receipts are
earmarked for reducing the public debt. Mr de Sousa is confident that
privatisations this year will yield the Es200bn anticipated in the 1994
budget presented by Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, the former finance minister.
Mr de Sousa says there will be no limits for foreigners in any further
privatisations carried out during this government's term in office, which
ends in the second half of 1995. The failed sale of BPSM, whose public
tender closed last autumn, was in fact the first without such limits, and
the same applies for the sale of Secil-CMP, which was launched this month.
Mr de Sousa denies that this new approach is the result of pressure from the
European Commission. Portugal has been under threat of legal action in
Brussels for alleged violation of the European Union's provisions for the
free movement of capital. Mr de Sousa argues, however, that these were not
yet in force when Portugal launched its privatisation programme in 1989 and
that, in any case, the main disagreement with Brussels is not over first,
but second sales.
Portugal has always maintained that its initial privatisations were intended
to restructure national economic groups, which had suffered 'an abrupt break
in historic evolution' as Mr de Sousa put it, when they were nationalised
after the 1974 revolution.
In January, the government announced it was raising the limit for foreigners
in second sales of privatised companies from between 10 and 20 per cent to
25 per cent, unless the maximum was higher anyway in the original sale.
'We will probably be able to increase this limit a little more - to 30 or 35
per cent, says Mr de Sousa, adding that each case will be judged
individually, depending on whether the companies have had enough time for
restructuring.
Mr de Sousa's other pledge is to ensure a wider distribution of shares.
'This isn't so much a change of philosophy', he says, 'but more of a
practical change to be applied in the upcoming privatisations, which is also
conditioned by the type of companies involved.'
Mr de Sousa says that abolishing limits for foreigners, which could favour
large international shareholders, will not necessarily clash with the idea
of widening distribution. He says distribution should be ensured by the
statutes of the company in question rather than by legislation.
'There should be clauses compatible with company law, such as limiting
voting power,' he says. 'The change in the statutes will most probably be
introduced at the beginning of the privatisation process.'
However, wider distribution also implies abandoning one of the government's
original concepts, which was to strengthen national groups.
'We have to be realistic about the capital involved and the financial
capacity of Portuguese groups', Mr de Sousa concedes.
There are, however, plans to maintain national control in strategic sectors,
such as energy and telecommunications, either by maintaining a majority or a
percentage guaranteeing a strong golden share.
There are to be no changes in the method of privatisation applied so far.
For each operation, the government will decide whether it should be through
negotiation, stock exchange auction, or public tender.
The next privatisation, the second attempt at selling the state's shares in
Secil-CMP, has already been launched, and at least four more are planned for
the first half of this year. Mr de Sousa says the first 25 per cent of
Portugal's largest cement company, Cimpor, will be sold off 'before summer'
in an stock exchange auction with no indivisible block. Ultimately, the
government plans to sell a majority and retain a golden share.
A second attempt at privatising Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor will also be made.
The 7.5 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA) earmarked for
foreigners should be sold in April, while this semester is also likely to
see the sale of another segment of the national bus network, Rodoviaria
Nacional (RN). RN's two remaining sections are likely to be privatised
before the end of the year.
There will also be an indirect partial privatisation of Banco Fomento
Exterior through Cimpor's 30 per cent holding in the bank, and Mr de Sousa
says that the privatisation of BFE could go even further at a later stage.
There is less certainty for this year in the attractive telecommunications
sector. The merger of state-held companies Telecom and Telefones de Lisboa e
Porto (TLP) which, between them, operate telephone links in Portugal, Europe
and the Mediterranean, as well as Teledifusao Portuguesa (TDP), which beams
television signals around Portugal, must take place first. No decision has
been taken yet on the possible integration of the overseas operator Marconi,
which is only 51 per cent state-held.
Problems involving three complicated cases are still being resolved. The
much-restructured Siderurgia Nacional is in the process of being reassessed,
but for Mr de Sousa it is clear that any further restructuring will have to
be carried out by the buyers.
In the case of the oil giant Petrogal, the government is still negotiating
with Petrocontrol, a consortium comprising domestic investors and Total of
France.
The group bought 25 per cent in 1992, but is refusing to fulfil its
obligation to acquire a further 26 per cent within three years, unless the
government injects funds.
Although Mr de Sousa is confident that upcoming privatisations will prove
attractive, the recent difficulties indicate that the government might find
it hard to achieve its aim of reducing the weight of the state sector in the
overall economy by half, to 8.5 per cent, during the current legislature.

Attractive advantages - Madeira offshore centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Madeira, set in the Atlantic 600km off Casablanca and on the same latitude
as Bermuda, has been providing a haven of warmth and tranquility for North
Europeans ever since the British aristocracy made the island a fashionable
winter resort in the mid-18th century.
Today, tourism remains the mainstay of the island's economy, accounting for
more than 12 per cent of Madeira's gross regional product. But tourism has
recently been joined by another, equally successful source of income: a
dynamic offshore development known as the Madeira International Business
Centre (IBC).
Established with the help of the European Union to stimulate development,
the IBC offers investors the benefits of both EU membership and a zero tax
rate. Covering the full range of offshore services, Madeira provides a
free-trade industrial zone, a financial centre, international services and a
shipping register, all benefiting from tax and duty exemptions.
The IBC was conceived as a special incentive, on top of extensive support
from EU structural funds, to help the island bridge the development gap
separating it from the rest of western Europe. 'Studies of other peripheral
EU regions show that grants alone are simply not enough to overcome the
disadvantages of insularity,' says Mr Jorge Veiga Franca, a director of the
Madeira Development Company (SDM), which runs the offshore centre.
This stimulus to Madeira's economy offers attractive advantages for
investors. Since legislation on the offshore centre was approved in 1986,
close to 1,200 companies have set up in the IBC: 38 manufacturers are
operating in the free-trade zone; 32 companies, mostly bank branches, have
registered with the financial centre; and 36 vessels are listed on the
shipping register, known as MAR. The rest are doing business in the
international services sector.
Madeira's full integration into the EU is an important asset. Companies
operating in Madeira benefit from the free circulation of goods, services
and rights of establishment within the Community that is guaranteed to all
EU enterprises. All raw materials and components imported into the
industrial free-trade zone are exempt from customs duties. Duties are levied
only on raw materials from third countries incorporated into finished
products exported to the EU.
Companies enjoy total exemption from taxes on profits and capital gains
until the end of the year 2011. Officials are confident that the rate will
subsequently be increased to only 5 or 10 per cent. Investors also benefit
from exchange freedom, including free repatriation of capital and profits,
free transfer of funds used in commercial operations and freedom to import
capital.
IBC officials believe they have an important edge over other offshore
centres because Madeira is an integrated part of Portugal, not isolated in
either economic or legislative terms. Companies setting up there enjoy the
same guarantees of credibility as they would in mainland Portugal.
Maintaining this image is a priority. 'We would prefer 10 good companies to
100 dubious ones,' says Mr Francisco Costa, chairman of SDM and chief
architect of the IBC.
The Madeira regional government opted to negotiate a concession agreement
with SDM so that the IBC would be run by a private company that speaks the
same business language as investors. Efforts are made to cut red tape to a
minimum, with a special public deeds office set up to ease formalities.
However, the IBC acknowledges that ship owners have recently encountered
delays in registering vessels with MAR because of difficulties raised by a
technical commission appointed by the regional and central governments.
'This is a bureaucratic issue that we expect to clear up very shortly,' said
an IBC spokesman.
On a more positive note, recently approved regulations make Madeira's
shipping register considerably more attractive than before. To register,
half a ship's crew and its captain must now be of EU nationalities where
previous legislation stipulated that the same proportion of the crew had to
be Portuguese. Ship owners may now chose any country whose laws they want to
govern the mortgage of their vessel. Yachts are also now eligible.
So far, the financial centre of the IBC has predominantly attracted
Portuguese bank branches. From Madeira they can provide all the services of
an overseas branch without the heavy costs of establishing a network abroad.
Several important foreign banks have followed suit and legislation approved
in January should make the financial centre attractive to a wider range of
companies.
The new law makes it possible for financial companies to set up subsidiaries
in Madeira where they were previously limited to opening branches. 'This
measure will broaden the appeal of the IBC,' says Mr William Cunningham, a
Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. 'There was little
incentive for a foreign financial institution to set up a branch in Madeira
if it was going to be taxed on the earnings of that branch in its home
country. Now that tax can be avoided by creating a subsidiary.'
The institutions now allowed to set up subsidiaries in Madeira's financial
centre include banks, investment societies, leasing, factoring and
higher-purchase companies, stock brokers, dealers, investment fund managers,
credit card issuers, asset management, regional development, venture capital
and group purchasing companies, exchange bureaux, insurance and re-insurance
companies and pension funds.
The new legislation also allows banks to set up international branches as
well as offshore branches. Offshore branches may only do business with
non-residents in Portugal or other companies in the IBC. The ability to
establish international branches means that banks in Madeira can do business
with Portuguese companies. They will be subjected to normal Portuguese tax
laws, except that they will be able to accept deposits from non-residents in
Portugal without having to withhold a 20 per cent tax on the interest paid
on the deposits.
'Previously banks in the Madeira offshore centre were completely fenced off
from doing business with mainland companies,' says Mr Cunningham. 'The new
measure means that Portuguese banks that set up international rather than
offshore branches in Madeira will be able to raise money more cheaply than
in Portugal for lending on to their clients on the mainland.'

Big portfolio clean-up ahead - Insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
As they gear up for the single European market, Portugal's insurance
companies have understood that they can no longer rely on profits from
financial investments while neglecting their real business, which is selling
insurance policies. However, adjustments have only just begun, and the real
cleaning up of portfolios and companies has been left for this year.
Despite the current recession, provisional results indicate that for
insurers 1993 was less bleak than the previous year. But results are still a
far cry from what the companies would have wished for.
According to an estimate by the Association of Portuguese Insurers (APS),
the sector sold about Es530bn worth of premiums in 1993. This means it still
grew by 22.2 per cent and, if the drop in inflation is taken into account,
the real increase was about 24.6 per cent.
Car and work accident insurances, which represent about half of all
premiums, remain the Achilles heel of the market. But judging by last year's
development, the car division should soon see better days. APS estimates
that companies managed to cut losses to about Es10.5bn in 1993, half of
1992's total. Things look gloomier in work accidents, where losses may have
been as high as Es11.5bn, some Es3bn more than a year before.
Following an embittered war for market shares, which led to disastrous 1992
results, Portuguese insurance companies finally began introducing reforms in
1993. The process is likely to be intensified in 1994.
Analysts warn that decision-making in many companies is still guided by
faith and inertia and that growth at any cost but at the expense of
profitability and solidity remained the main tendency in 1993.
This view is not shared, however, by Mr Ruy de Carvalho, president of the
APS. He points out that the very reason why many companies registered only
little growth last year was exactly because they began cleaning up their
portfolios, adjusting their risk policy, and adapting prices to Portuguese
reality.
As a result and because of the introduction of a new invalidity chart,
tariffs for work accident insurances are expected to increase by 20 per cent
or more this year. In the car sector, prices are expected to rise by about
15 per cent.
The development in life insurances, which account for 31.5 per cent of
premiums, followed two different paths. Individual insurances saw growth
increase from 24.4 per cent in 1992 to 38 per cent last year. In voluntary
group life insurances, on the other hand, the recession resulted in a severe
reduction of growth, from 61.3 per cent in 1992 to 18.7 per cent.
There is disagreement among Portuguese companies whether there will be
increased competition from companies not yet established in Portugal once
the single European market for the insurance sector comes into effect in
July, when the third generation directives granting full freedom to offer
services are applied.
Some companies say that little will change because the main international
companies are already operating here. Others think the new directives could
lead to considerable losses for Portuguese companies.
Mr de Carvalho says the Portuguese market is well prepared from a legal
point of view. But things look different in practice: 'Portuguese companies,
even the big ones, are medium-sized in European terms. This shows how
difficult it is for us to compete successfully in a market that will be
extremely open.'
Mr de Carvalho believes that companies will have to improve their technical
skills or call in outside specialists. He also thinks that big
transformations will take place among the many small companies with a market
quota of less than 1 per cent. Mr de Carvalho expects mergers and what he
calls 'a passive internationalisation'; that is, companies opening up their
capital to foreign companies.
While raising tariffs, insurance companies are also trying to improve
services and reduce costs. According to APS, Portuguese insurance companies
invested about Es7bn in computerisation in 1992 (figures for 1993 are not
yet available) and may have reduced their staff by 5 per cent in 1993.
Due to expensive settlements for early retirement and redundancy payments,
the effects of these efforts have not yet made their mark on the accounts.
But they are seen as an investment in the future.
General expenses are still very high, considering that they represent 25 per
cent of premiums sold - about twice the EU-average.
A working group comprising representatives of the finance ministry,
insurance companies, banks, the stock market and investment funds discussed
for two years the problems of Portugal's financial sector. While the
resulting white paper for the banking sector has already been published,
insurance companies are still awaiting publication of the section on their
business. Parts of it have been leaked to the press, but due to an agreement
to remain silent, companies are reluctant to comment on it. The 'livro
branco' - basically a code of conduct for Portuguese insurance companies in
the large EU-market - contains an analysis of the Portuguese market and its
capacity to modernise, as well as chapters on subjects such as pension
funds, supervision and tax regulations.
One thorny matter that remains to be resolved is that of health insurance.
For many companies, this area is littered with potential problems.
Health insurance currently accounts for only 2.6 per cent of premiums and is
loss-making. A government proposal for a new scheme, which was to provide an
alternative to its national health service, has found little or no favour
with insurers. From the very beginning, companies objected to the
government's idea of exclusiveness, saying that in a country such as
Portugal only a complementary scheme could work; a combination of private
and public health insurance.
APS says those with high incomes might well opt for private health insurance
only, but that such a solution should not be imposed by law.
Another concern is that because costs in the health sector are soaring, only
companies should be allowed to establish the prices for such insurances.
Finally, the market opposes life-long policies.
Mr de Carvalho concedes that the government has moved closer to the
insurers' views. He adds that the sector is now hoping for even more
sympathy from the new health minister, Mr Paulo Mendo, who took office last
December.
'We are very interested in finding a good solution', he says. 'But insurance
companies cannot accept a scheme which will lead to exactly the same
problems the national health service is suffering. We do not have a state
budget behind us, nor can we rely on the other EU countries for financial
help.'

Outlook for growth remains bright - Stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Breaking through the gloom of recession that has gripped Portugal for the
past year, the performance of the stock market has shone like a beacon.
While output fell and companies began reporting heavy losses, share prices
rose steadily and the outlook for continued growth remains bright.
Investors - ignoring dwindling industrial profits and fears that shrinking
margins and bad debt would hit banks - turned to the stock market in
ever-increasing numbers as an attractive alternative to bank deposits, the
traditional home of Portuguese savings.
'Liquidity is clearly driving the market,' says Mr Joaquim Luiz Gomes, an
analyst with independent stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'Institutional and
private investors are attributing more and more weight in their portfolios
to equity because the returns are more attractive.'
Term deposit rates fell from 15 per cent to about 7 per cent in 1993 and
many banks are simply refusing longer-term deposits because of the minimal
earnings they offer. Bond rates have also dropped sharply, with interest on
one-year bonds, for example, shrinking from 19 per cent to 10.5 per cent
over the past two years. These rates compare with earnings of about 20 per
cent offered by share investment funds.
Growing interest in shares drove up the Banco Totta e Azores (BTA) share
index by 59.6 per cent in 1993 to 2,614. Prices have continued to rise
steadily this year, with the BTA index growing 19.6 per cent to 3,126.8 on
February 9. The few market operators who will be drawn into a forecast
predict share prices will rise between 20 and 30 per cent in 1994.
They are also agreed that a price correction is almost inevitable. 'If share
prices continue to climb over the next few months it is very likely there
will be a spell of profit-taking that will set the index back,' says Mr
William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen.
The market can not depend on liquidity alone if it wants to maintain solid
growth. 'There will eventually have to be some adherence to reality,' says
Mr Gomes. 'Many industrial shares currently have a price-earnings ratio of
20. Investors will soon want to see profit levels of 20 per cent or more as
a foundation for that ratio.'
Trading volume on the Lisbon stock exchange rose by 97 per cent to Es2,849bn
in 1993 while the value of the market more than doubled to Es2,193bn. Bond
trading accounted for 85 per cent of total volume compared with 81 per cent
in 1992. Public debt bonds represented 95 per cent of bond trading, boosted
by the admission last year of 10 treasury bonds to the continuous national
trading system.
Trading in shares accounted for 15 per cent of total volume compared with 18
per cent in 1992. Share trading volume rose 58 per cent to Es417.9bn. The
183 companies quoted had a market capitalisation of Es2,193bn in December,
1993 compared with Es1,431bn a year earlier.
In a market where foreign investors have traditionally set buying and
selling trends, domestic investors are now beginning to dominate. In
particular, Portuguese banks seeking new products as alternatives to
traditional loans and deposits - where their intermediation margins are
shrinking - have launched a series of mutual, pension and other investment
funds.
In September 1993, 109 investment funds, 14 of them foreign, were operating
in Portugal, with Es1,500bn under their management. The biggest fund, with a
market share of 29 per cent, is CaixaGest, run by Caixa Geral de Depositos,
the state-owned savings bank and Portugal's largest financial institution.
Bond funds represented 71 per cent of the total and share applications only
2.9 per cent. But the funds are gradually increasing their equity weightings
and even a 1 per cent change can make an impact on the share market.
'Small investors used to invest directly on the stock market as if they were
playing roulette,' says Mr Jose Cardoso de Matos, director of marketing and
organisation for the Lisbon bourse. 'Now they are entrusting their money to
funds who do the job in a much more professional way.'
In addition to falling interest rates, interest in the stock market has been
spurred by the official listing of Portugal on emerging market indexes such
as the IFC. This has attracted new investment from emerging market funds
launched mainly in the US and the UK.
Confidence in Portugal has also been stimulated by recent operational and
administrative reforms including the adoption of a continuous trading
system, a computerised stock registration house and a new administrative law
that governs insider trading, company disclosures rules and other areas.
These reforms could be taken an important step further this year following a
proposal by the stock exchange commission (CMVM) for a restructuring of the
country's two bourses as part of plans to create a futures and options
market. The CMVM aims to reconcile opposing bids by the rival Lisbon and
Oporto bourses to set up a national derivatives exchange, a move considered
fundamental for the development of Portugal's capital market.
Mr Fernando de Costa Lima, CMVM president, says the commission proposes
replacing the spot market in Oporto with a futures and options exchange and
developing a national spot market in Lisbon.
The Lisbon and Oporto bourses currently compete with separate spot markets
although 69 of the most liquid shares are quoted on a national continuous
market for which Lisbon and Oporto act as separate trading floors. The daily
volume of share trading in the continuous market is Es2bn to Es3bn.
Last year, the two exchanges presented rival projects for setting up a
futures and options market. But Mr Costa Lima wants the two bourses to
overcome their differences and co-operate in building two national markets
for spot and derivative operations. This would end competition between
Lisbon and Oporto for the same small market.

Results still awaited - Foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSANNE RINDLISBACHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's Ministry for Trade and Tourism is in a sombre mood about last
year's foreign investment. Results are still awaiting official publication,
but all available information indicates there has been a drop of more than
50 per cent compared to 1992.
To make things worse, most large contractual projects will not meet
production and export levels agreed with the government. Lisbon is trying to
reverse the downward tendency by simplifying legal procedures and
establishing more direct contacts with potential investors.
'Really very bad', is the only comment from the ministry, while 1993's
figures for direct foreign investment remain tucked away in a drawer. A
spokesman says the drop from 1992's Dollars 4.375bn is 'tremendous' and
amounts to more than 50 per cent. The most recent official figure published
by the Bank of Portugal is Es111.7bn for the first seven months of 1993;
about half the total for the same period in the previous year. The first
signs of flagging interest emerged in 1992 - when direct foreign investment
suffered a 26 per cent drop compared to 1991.
In addition, estimates of what impact the seven big contractual investments
negotiated with the Portuguese government between 1989 and 1992 will have on
the country's economy, need to be revised. Until recently, the government
hailed these projects as stepping stones for an out-of-date industry on its
way into the 21st century. They would bring modern technology and know-how
to Portugal; create many new jobs and make a huge contribution to Portugal's
export statistics.
The height of euphoria was reached in 1991 when the government signed a
contract with Ford and Volkswagen whose giant joint venture, AutoEuropa,
will produce a multi-purpose vehicle at Palmela, south of Lisbon.
A study carried out last year by ICEP, the body that promotes investment,
trade and tourism in Portugal, said that once they started production in
1995, these projects could represent 20-30 per cent of exports and between 2
and 3 per cent of gross domestic product growth.
Last December, the Bank of Portugal published an article, saying that GDP
growth could reach 8-9 per cent when AutoEuropa started producing in 1995,
if ICEP's figures were correct and the aims established in the investment
contracts were met. But this scenario is turning out to be highly
unrealistic because most of the 'seven giants' - which together were
expected to reach production worth Es1,000bn and exports of Es926bn by the
year 2000 - will have to readjust their projections.
ICEP confirmed reports that the contractual projects were facing problems.
One of the seven, the tyre manufacturer Continental-Mabor, has already
reached agreement with the government to extend by three years (until 2003)
the date for reaching the targets originally agreed.
Two others - General Motors' Delco Remi, which produces electronic
components, and the Finnish petrochemical company Neste - are negotiating a
reassessment of their estimates.
The four remaining companies say they cannot possibly reach their
objectives, mainly because of the international recession. Neste, car
components manufacturer CofapEuropa, and Pepsico's potato chips factory
Laprovar are halving their export targets. AutoEuropa and the car radio
manufacturer Ford Electronica are not publishing their revised estimate,
saying production will depend on the market situation.
Despite the unfavourable circumstances, Mr Miguel Athayde Marques, ICEP
president, views 1994 with some optimism: 'Interest among big foreign
multinationals who visit us and ask for information has increased so we
expect lively economic activity'.
Portugal continues to present itself as an attractive place for foreign
investors, with low wages and overall costs, good productivity levels,
favourable European Union-backed incentives, rapidly-expanding
communications and other infrastructures, and a stable political situation.
To investors from outside the EU, the country maintains it is a gateway to
the European market.
ICEP itself intends to play a more active role in future and is working on a
new strategy to capture investors.
These efforts will be bolstered by a new law on foreign investment, aimed at
simplifying the process for investors and expected to come into effect this
year. New rules for registering projects will be established and the quality
of information on investment possibilities is to be improved.
By granting attractive incentives, the government is mainly trying to
attract investments in industries involving new technologies, particularly
those in areas with high unemployment. However, results for the first six
months of 1993 show that banks and other financial institutions, as well as
real estate and other services continued to be favoured, absorbing almost 70
per cent of direct foreign investment.
In industry, the AutoEuropa project is still managing to attract new
suppliers to the Setubal region. One of them is the Somer Allibert company,
which signed a Es11bn investment contract with the government at the end of
last year and is to create about 660 jobs.
Recent industrial projects in the country's interior region include two
Dutch factories in Ansiao. One will produce wooden boxes for cigars and
chocolates; the other will make panels for metal insulation. Total
investment for the two projects is just under Es700m, and some 60 new jobs
will be created.
Investment opportunities will also continue in infrastructure development.
In telecommunications, the Portuguese government is negotiating with ICL of
Britain and its parent company, Japan's Fujitsu, over the construction of a
factory for systems for the management of telephone lines and high-speed
optical fibre amplifiers involving an estimated investment of Es9bn. Talks
are centering on incentives, which would come from the government and EU
funds.
A decision on which of seven international consortia will be awarded the
contract for construction of what will be the country's largest dam, at Foz
Coa in northern Portugal, is also pending. This hydroelectric project
involves an estimated investment of Es43bn.
But not everyone is happy about international investors coming to Portugal.
National construction companies have protested because a foreign consortium
may win the contract to construct a natural gas pipeline between Setubal,
south of Lisbon, and the northern town of Braga.
They maintain that this Es40bn project should remain 'national', especially
because it does not require particularly sophisticated construction
techniques.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (3):
More painful results likely - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portuguese banks rose above bleak business conditions in 1993 to produce
overall profit growth of about 11 per cent. But the delayed impact of the
recession is likely to emerge in 1994 with more painful results.
Several factors combined to produce a pessimistic outlook for last year.
Industrial investment was contracting sharply, reducing the demand for
credit. Fierce competition for deposits was shrinking financial margins.
Bad credit was on the rise, demanding greater provisions. Pension funds
required additional provisioning and the central bank was about to demand
contributions to a deposit guarantee fund.
In the event, profits not only grew slightly more than in 1992 but the share
prices of banks, which account for 65 per cent of equity turnover on the
stock market, also rose by 53 per cent.
Part of the explanation for this buoyant performance was a shift away from
financial intermediation as a source of earnings to commissions, fee-based
income and the cross-selling of financial products.
'Financial margins fell by about one percentage point in 1993 to 3.5-4 per
cent. This is close to the European average and lower than margins in Spain,
for example,' says Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, president of Banco Espirito Santo
and of the Portuguese Bankers' Association.
'But in compensation, banks increased their commissions, equating them more
closely with real costs.' Supported by high margins, Portuguese banks had
traditionally waived commissions or levied charges at below cost.
Among the biggest sources of income were trading in public debt securities
and some lucrative foreign exchange operations during the currency crises
that assailed the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
last year. The cross-selling of financial products also became increasingly
important.
'Banking is increasingly becoming a services-oriented business rather than
one based on the intermediation of money,' says Mr Joao Freixa, assistant
general manager of Barclays Bank in Portugal. 'Customers are looking for a
wide range of financial products and discerning advice on how to invest
their money rather than just a place to deposit it.'
Banks also adjusted their asset portfolios to offset the effect of
diminishing margins.
They moved into long-term government debt, offering rates of 20 to 25 per
cent in 1993, and into commercial paper, which attracted corporate borrowers
with rates two points below traditional bank credit.
At the same time, banks reduced the maturity of their deposits, persuading
customers into more profitable short-term deposits and away from anything
with a longer maturity than six months.
Stringent cost-cutting programmes were implemented, successfully lowering
the relatively high level of operational costs supported by most Portuguese
banks. Except for a number of smaller banks fighting for market share, most
institutions reined back the ambitious branch network expansion programmes
that have characterised the sector over recent years.
Investment in information systems also helped improve efficiency.
The most surprising element contributing to bank profits was a significant
increase in the amount of credit extended to customers, despite the
depressive effect of the recession. Official figures show that credit grew
by a sharp 17 per cent during the first half of 1993 and is estimated to
have risen by 10 per cent over the whole year. Allowing for inflation, this
represents real growth of about 3.5 per cent.
Bankers offer several explanations. There was a substantial increase in
private loans. Consumer credit, starting from virtually zero, exploded last
year. New entrants into the house-purchase credit market stimulated strong
growth of mortgage loans. In addition, large corporations that used to
borrow in foreign currencies from foreign banks because of lower interest
rates switched back to escudo financing from domestic banks to hedge against
risk following the European currency crises.
An additional explanation is that some banks deliberately renewed bad
credit, capitalising the interest due into the new loans, to avoid
provisioning against the bad debt. Mr Vaz Pinto believes this procedure had
considerable impact on the growth of credit in 1993 and on the balance
sheets of some banks.
But he says it is impossible to quantify the exact extent of such
'window-dressing'. Some banks are also thought to have domiciled bad loans
in their offshore branches in Madeira, where regulations on provisioning
against bad credit do not apply.
'Central bank regulations on provisioning for bad debt are not as strict in
Portugal as in many other European countries and some banks have taken
advantage of this to make the barest minimum provisions,' said an economist
with a leading bank. 'Auditors of banks who have renewed bad credit must
also be held responsible for failing to draw attention to the lack of
sufficient provisioning.'
A central bank spokesman said new regulations for provisioning for bad debt
were being studied. He said the authorities were monitoring the question of
refreshing bad loans but had found no cause for alarm. Portuguese banks are
required to set aside the equivalent of 2 per cent of their total credit as
general risk provision. The usual level in Europe is 1 per cent.
The total amount of bad debt in the Portuguese banking system is estimated
to have risen from Es450bn at the end of 1992 to more than Es650bn in
December, 1993; an increase from about 7 per cent of total credit to 8 per
cent. Bankers are agreed that the situation will worsen.
'The full impact of bad debt resulting from a recession does not usually hit
the banks until one or two years later,' said a Lisbon banker. 'And
provisions will have to be made sooner or later for existing bad debts that
have been rolled over.'
Some banks also eased the pressure on their balance sheets in 1993 by
delaying the capitalisation of pension funds. They were also saved from
making contributions to a deposit guarantee fund, now likely to be created
in 1994.
In this scenario, most bankers are not forecasting a significant increase in
profits in 1994 despite the forecast upturn in the economy. Stock market
analysts say banks remain undervalued in comparison with industrial stocks
and they forecast share price gains of 10 to 15 per cent for the banking
sector this year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (2):
New finance minister wins support - The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister, has entrusted the mission
of leading his country out of recession to Mr Eduardo Catroga, a genial,
silver-haired businessman who was sworn in as finance minister following a
cabinet reshuffle last December.
Mr Catroga, respected in the corporate world for his capacity for
decision-making, is a former company manager with practical experience of
the problems of Portuguese industry. His down-to-earth approach has already
won sympathy from a business and financial community often at odds with his
younger, technocratic or academic predecessors.
Support for the minister to pull the country out of its first recession in
eight years is strong, but he has no illusions that the task is going to be
easy. 'Recovery may be slow and difficult,' he warned in his first speech,
delivered to a conference of industrialists.
After eight years when its growth rate was higher than the European Union
average, Portugal fell into recession in 1993 with output dropping an
estimated 0.5 to 1 per cent. Exports were hit hard by recession in the EU,
which accounts for three quarters of the country's trade, falling by a
forecast 3-5 per cent in volume.
External difficulties were compounded by policy mismanagement at home as the
tax machine virtually collapsed, leading to a doubling of the budget deficit
over the original forecast. Markets were confused by a rift over
interest-rate policy between the finance ministry and the central bank.
In the face of a deepening slump, the government, which had originally
forecast 3 per cent growth in 1993, was forced to abandon the premise that
Portugal was an oasis of expansion in a Europe laid low by recession.
Recession, most analysts agree, was an inevitability that the government
tried too long to ignore. 'The cycle of growth in Portugal had been so
extraordinarily long that an adjustment could no longer be avoided,' says
one bank economist.
The slump will get worse before it gets better, but there are signs that it
will bottom out during the first half of 1994. Portugal should register
positive growth of 0.5-1 per cent this year, most probably remaining below
the EU average. Recovery is expected to take a firmer grip in 1995, moving
gross domestic product growth close to 3 per cent.
An improvement in some of Portugal's main markets, most notably the UK,
should boost exports towards the end of this year. An expected gradual 2-3
per cent devaluation of the escudo in 1994 against the currencies of the
country's main trading partners will help make export prices more
competitive.
The government has been maintaining a strong escudo since 1990. The central
bank made expensive interventions to maintain the currency's parity during
the foreign exchange crises of 1993. Nevertheless, the escudo devalued by
some 10 per cent last year against an average of European currencies. But
now that inflationary pressures are more subdued and the currency has
achieved stability within the EU's exchange rate mechanism, the central bank
is likely to adopt a less interventionist approach to exchange rate policy.
Transfers of EU funds will almost certainly make the most important
contribution to recovery in Portugal.
The country's Community Support Framework for 1994 to 1999 will benefit from
Es3,500bn in subsidies from Brussels. 'This is double the amount Portugal
received from 1988 to 1993 and represents about 3 per cent of GDP a year,'
says Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief economist with Banco Portugues de
Investimento.
Most of these funds, scheduled to begin arriving this summer, will be
channelled into transport infrastructures, telecommunications and industrial
grants, mobilising total public and private investment of some Es10,000bn
over the six-year period.
Grants for professional training will provide at least temporary occupation
for some 50,000 workers.
Mr Catroga's other main instrument for fostering recovery will be interest
rates. Portuguese industry has been heavily penalised by the high cost of
money. After a fall of 4 percentage points in 1993, small and medium-sized
companies were paying interest rates of 16 per cent for 30-day credit at the
end of the year, a real rate of 9.5 per cent.
'Recovery requires a sustained reduction in the costs of corporate financing
that brings Portuguese interest rates much closer to those in other European
countries,' the minister says.
The central bank has already cut its liquidity absorption rate four times
this year by a total of 0.75 percentage points, signalling a reduction in
short-term credit rates. Further substantial reductions are expected through
the year.
Mr Catroga has made clear that a reduction in interest rates can only be
achieved against a background of budgetary control and wage restraint if
inflation is to be kept in check. He is likely to be less successful with
budgetary control than with wage restraint.
Portugal succeeded in cutting its budget deficit from 12 per cent of GDP in
1984 to 4.7 per cent in 1992, but it soared to 8.2 per cent in the
recessionary climate of 1993. Improvements in tax administration are
urgently needed to boost public finances but even with progress in this
direction the budget deficit is unlikely to fall much below the 1993 level
either this year or in 1995, an election year.
Negotiations for a national wage pact for 1994 collapsed late last year, but
the government has set a tough example for the private sector by keeping
public administrative sector pay rises to 2.5 per cent.
Private sector workers fearful of unemployment, which is expected to grow
from 6.2 per cent in 1993 to some 7.5 per cent this year, are likely to
settle pay claims at below 4 per cent.
In this climate, average annual inflation should fall from 6.5 per cent in
1993 to around 5.5-6 per cent this year. But an expanding budget deficit
could lead to a slight rise in inflation in 1995 to about 7 per cent.
'I have great confidence that Portuguese companies will grow more and more
competitive,' says Mr Catroga. He is as aware as anyone of the difficulties
that process will entail. Industrial production has been falling steadily
since 1991. Achieving greater competitiveness through restructuring will be
a politically painful process involving company closures, large-scale
dismissals and relocations.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (1): A
time for celebration and reflection - After eight years of economic
expansion, Portugal has plunged into a recession. It has exposed the dark
side of a society where sleek office blocks rise in a capital city ringed by
shanty towns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crowds waving red carnations will throng the streets of Lisbon this April in
commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the 'Revolution of the
Flowers' that ended 48 years of dictatorship and set western Europe's
poorest country on the road to prosperity.
The anniversary will be an occasion to celebrate the principal legacies of
the revolution: a stable parliamentary democracy, membership of what is now
the European Union and sustained economic growth that has improved living
standards and moved Portugal past Greece in terms of output per capita.
But the commemoration will also be a time for reflection on what has not yet
been achieved and why. After eight years of economic expansion, Portugal has
plunged into a recession that has exposed the unappealing underside of a
society that the government has been describing as 'an oasis of growth in
Europe' and a 'democracy of success'.
Sleek office blocks are rising in a new financial centre in Lisbon but the
city is still fringed with makeshift shanty towns, where thousands live in
abject poverty.
'A country that launches its own satellites can't have people living in such
conditions,' acknowledges Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public
works, transport and communications. The government has promised to spend
Es300bn to wipe out shanty towns within five years.
Many of those living in these 'bairros de lata' are destitute farm workers
who have moved to the cities in search of work. Portugal's backward
agricultural sector, which employs 12 per cent of the labour force, has
proved unable to compete successfully within a single European market.
Reduced earnings have left a majority of farm workers living at subsistence
level on incomes only a third as big as those of their Spanish counterparts.
Portuguese average wages as a whole are lower than in developing countries
such as Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, let alone any other western European
country.
Industry is also suffering the effects of increasing competition.
Traditional sectors such as textiles - which accounts for 30 per cent of
exports - footwear, ceramics and metallurgy are undergoing a radical
restructuring process that involves widespread closures and dismissals.
Unemployment rose from 4.2 per cent of the labour force in 1992 to 6.2 per
cent in 1993 and will climb significantly higher this year.
Many more people have been given access to state health care and education
since the revolution. But services are poorly organised and facilities are
often rudimentary. Welfare payments such as unemployment pay and old-age
pensions are barely sufficient to live on.
'The country is moving towards modernity; towards development; towards
credibility, and towards having a voice within the European Union,' says Mr
Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister. 'But it will not be easy. The process
involves changing mentalities. We cannot afford to support enterprises that
are inefficient. We have to concentrate our resources on companies with the
potential to compete at an international level.'
Mr Cavaco Silva admits that the recession of 1993, when output fell 0.5 to 1
per cent, was the most difficult period for his centre-right government
since he came to office in 1985. But the economic cycles that have served
him so well in the past appear to be evolving in his favour again.
Economists forecast that the slump will bottom out during the first half of
1994 and that gross domestic product growth for the year will reach 1 per
cent. By the time of the next general election, in October 1995, the economy
is likely to be expanding at a rate of 3 per cent a year.
The EU, whose funds have contributed so much to Portugal's growth in recent
years, will again play a crucial role in an economic pick-up that will boost
Mr Cavaco Silva's chances of re-election at the head of what would be his
third majority government. He says he will refuse to serve in a minority
government.
EU aid to Portugal for the period 1994-1999 is estimated at Es3,500bn,
double that of the previous six-year period. The new funds will begin
arriving this summer, stimulating public and private investment in industry
and, particularly, transport and communications infrastructure. The
beginnings of recovery in some of Portugal's main export markets will be an
additional factor in launching a new cycle of growth.
'The slump here has been relatively light and short-lived,' says Mr Joao
Freixa, assistant general manager of Barclays Bank in Portugal. 'This time,
the authorities appear to have been right when they predicted Portugal would
be the last to fall into recession and one of the first to move out.'
The banking sector, in fact, emerged from last year's recession with an
overall growth in profits of 11 per cent, slightly higher than in 1992.
Banks offset shrinking margins with substantial increases in income from
commissions and the cross-selling of the products of their financial
subsidiaries.
They also reaped important profits from trading in public debt securities
and foreign exchange during the currency crises in Europe last year.
Despite the recession, total credit advanced rose by about 10 per cent. This
was partly due to the growth of new products such as consumer and
house-purchase credit. But, according to Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, president
of the Portuguese Bankers' Association, some banks also deliberately renewed
bad credits to avoid provisioning for them. Total bad debt is believed to
have risen from Es450bn in 1992 to more than Es650bn last year; about 8 per
cent of total credit.
The proportion of bad debt is almost certain to increase this year as the
effects of the recession on industrial companies filter through to the
banks.
Another financial sector that has bucked the recessionary trend is the
capital market. As short-term interest rates fell, investors turned to the
stock market for more attractive returns. Liquidity drove share prices up
more than 55 per cent in 1993, despite the poor prospects of many quoted
companies. Total market capitalisation doubled.
Recent reforms improving the technical and administrative functioning of the
stock market also inspired greater confidence from investors and the listing
of Portugal as an emerging market attracted investment from the steadily
increasing number of emerging market funds.
Another important step in the development of the capital market could be the
proposed creation of a futures and options exchange in the northern city of
Oporto.
Restructuring and liberalisation have progressed considerably faster in the
financial sector than in industry. The re-privatisation of banks and
insurance companies nationalised after the revolution has been completed
with the exception of one bank. A second attempt at privatising Banco Pinto
&amp; Sotto Mayor will be made this year. The government rejected a bid made for
the bank in 1993 as too low.
In the heady days of 1975, communist-led governments hailed the
nationalisations as 'conquests of the revolution'. Today, Portugal has a
sharply different perspective on what the revolution achieved. . . and what
has, as yet, been left undone.

FT  22 FEB 94 / How investment authority will police financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The publication yesterday of the two papers - the prospectus for the
Personal Investment Authority and the more detailed approach to regulation -
will have companies and individuals in the financial services industry
poring over the small print in the days ahead.
While there have been criticisms and concerns about what the proposed new
regulator will do and how it will work, the industry has consistently said
that it is the prospectus that will determine whether there is a queue to
join the regulator or a further attempt to find another solution.
How the PIA will operate: It will have a board of 21 members, made up of 10
active practitioners, 10 public-interest directors including the chairman,
and the chief executive. The board can be smaller, but must include equal
numbers of practitioners and public-interest directors.
It will have an audit committee to oversee its budget, and a nominations
committee to advise on board composition.
The membership committee, which will decide all matters relating to
admissions, and the disciplinary committee, may both include non-board
members.
The PIA will hold a range of working groups and task forces to advise on
specific issues, as a way of bringing in practitioner input while
maintaining a 'lean and flexible' committee structure.
It will also establish a small business practitioner panel to review the
regulatory proposals and practices to assess 'the most effective ways in
which PIA can ensure that its standards are being delivered by its smaller
members'.
Costs, fees and compensation: Costs for the first full year, from mid-July
when the PIA expects to become operational, are Pounds 29.5m. This includes
a Pounds 5.5m levy to the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, and Pounds 1m to cover the costs of an ombudsman scheme and
arbitration.
To raise revenue, fees to individuals and companies that are members of
existing regulators are to rise by 18 per cent, in a flat increase across
all members of the new regulator.
This structure of determining fees will operate for at least the first two
years. The basis for membership subscriptions cannot be changed without the
support of at least four-fifths of the board.
Firms applying to be members of the PIA will be charged Pounds 1,500, except
for those seeking to transfer from an existing regulator before the PIA
itself becomes operational.
On compensation, the PIA has to work within SIB plans to put a limit on the
investors' compensation scheme of Pounds 100m in any one year with no scope
for cross-subsidy. The PIA will seek to limit members' liability to Pounds
50m in any year by borrowing or getting insurance cover for the second
Pounds 50m of the scheme.
Independent practitioners will meet the first Pounds 5m of any compensation
claims, but the system for splitting costs above that with life companies
should make the maximum exposure for independent practitioners in any year
Pounds 9.5m.
Compensation liabilities arising from pension-transfer business, which is
the subject of a separate inquiry by SIB, will not come under these
arrangements but the aim is that there should be 'the same level of investor
protection as in other cases of default'.
Joining the PIA: The admissions process is intended to establish members'
honesty and reputation; solvency and financial standing; and competence and
organisation.
Questions will include: Are any benefits given which might give rise to
mis-selling? Has the member made any claims on its professional indemnity
insurance policy since 1991? Has the member satisfactory systems to monitor
the quality of advice?
No firm will be admitted without the PIA reviewing its standards, but
maximum use will be made of information already available to regulators.
Information will also come from other sources, including prudential
regulators such as the Bank of England and the Department of Trade and
Industry.
Applicants will be accepted unconditionally, rejected, or accepted subject
to certain conditions that must be met within a few months.
Conditional acceptance might involve a restriction on the range of business
a member could conduct, or require it to make improvements in, say, training
within a certain time.
The 70 staff assessing membership applications will be drawn from existing
regulators but will be trained to the PIA's own standards.
No member will be allowed to handle clients' money unless at least two
independent individuals are involved in the day-to-day conduct of its
investment business.
The design and delivery of the admissions process for transferring firms
will be audited by a team of senior regulators, which will report directly
to the PIA chief executive.
Application forms should be returned by April 5.
Requirements of membership: Initially, members should comply with the
training and competence arrangements laid down by their existing regulator.
The PIA intends to introduce its own scheme during 1995.
Members will have to maintain a minimum of Pounds 10,000 capital in their
'own funds'. Larger members will face higher requirements, as will those
that handle clients' money.
Some classes of members must maintain suitable professional indemnity
insurance, and ensure that their appointed representatives have suitable
cover.
The PIA will categorise all its members as either high-, medium- or
low-risk, depending on the type of business carried out and the nature of
the firm. The categorisations will be kept secret within the PIA.
Every high-risk member will be visited at least once every 12 months, every
medium-risk member at least once every 24 months, and every low-risk member
at least once every 30 months.
At least 5 per cent of PIA members every year will get a surprise inspection
visit.
There will be a three-tier discipline scheme, made up of the disciplinary
committee, the membership and disciplinary tribunal, and an appeal
commissioner. Sanctions will range from public or private reprimands,
through fines, restrictions and remedial action, to expulsion.
PIA's service to investors: A consumer panel of 10 to 15 members will be set
up to advise the PIA board on the concerns of private investors. It will
make an annual report on the PIA's effectiveness and be consulted on
proposals which affect investor protection.
If a complaint to a member is not settled within two months, then the
customer must be told of the right to refer the matter to the PIA ombudsman.
The ombudsman may make awards of up to Pounds 50,000 and can recommend more
than this. Members can also choose to be subject to the ombudsman for
business outside the PIA's scope, with a limit on awards in this area at
Pounds 100 000.
The PIA will have a complaints commissioner who will look at the way it
deals with complaints against itself.

FT  22 FEB 94 / BCCI chiefs accused of tricking Baqi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil charged with
fraud over the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, has
been made a scapegoat for the scandal, his defence counsel told the Old
Bailey yesterday.
In a closing speech, Mr Stephen Solley QC said Mr Baqi had been 'tricked and
seduced' by senior BCCI officials into signing the audit confirmation
reports (ACRs) that the prosecution claims were false and fraudulent.
The prosecution alleges the ACRs signed by Mr Baqi were used to falsely
inflate BCCI's profits by pretending the oil company owed the bank Dollars
90m (Pounds 61.6m). Mr Baqi denies 16 charges relating to the alleged
furnishing of false information.
Mr Solley said the prosecution claimed that Mr Baqi, with his commercial
experience, should have challenged the veracity of what he was being asked
to sign.
However, others including staff from Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors,
and Bank of England supervisors had also failed to react properly to signs
of fraud, Mr Solley said.
'Why is it that everyone at Price Waterhouse is innocent and everyone at the
Bank of England is walking away from this because they were told this, that
and another by Mr Swaleh Naqvi (the former BCCI chief executive), and Mr
Baqi is being asked to justify signing an ACR?' he asked.
The evidence that had emerged about the collapse of the bank 'stacked up
more heavily' against Price Waterhouse than Mr Baqi, he said.
Its staff had used second-best auditing practice in dealing with the ACRs,
allowing them to take comfort from BCCI when they knew they should not. 'If
Price Waterhouse had done things properly, the deepest part of the fraud
could never have happened,' he said.
The prosecution had also failed to appreciate how the Islamic culture of
BCCI dictated how its business was conducted, he said. This ethnic
background meant that had Mr Baqi questioned the veracity of what he was
told by Mr Naqvi and other bank officials, it would have constituted a deep
insult and affront to them.
The trial continues today.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Managers 'bear brunt of car levy'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Middle managers stand to lose most when new company-car taxes take effect in
April - with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra a year, says a survey
published yesterday.
But some top managers, driving mainly Jaguar, BMW and Mercedes cars, could
pay less tax, says human resources and employee benefits consultants WF
Corroon.
Under the new arrangement staff will be taxed on 35 per cent of the list
price of their company car with discounts for business mileage and the
vehicle's age.
The survey, which covered 255 organisations, found that most middle managers
drive Fords, Vauxhalls and Rovers costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds
23,600. The tax changes will mean 56 per cent of these managers could be
paying as much as Pounds 600 more tax a year for their cars.
Among chairmen, chief executives and managing directors, about one in three
would have a higher tax bill and the remainder would pay less.
The survey says a driver with a company Ford Granada 2.01 Ghia costing
Pounds 19,150 would pay Pounds 591 more tax under the new system. But a top
manager with a four-litre Pounds 33,700 Jaguar XJ6 would pay Pounds 871 less
tax.
Other findings were that Jaguars were the most popular company cars for top
executives, one-in-five companies said they offered chairmen, chief
executives and managing directors a monthly cash allowance as an alternative
to a car, and more than 25 per cent of companies offered directors and
others a cash alternative.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Fears over jobs hit consumer optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fear of unemployment and concern about April's tax rises has brought an
abrupt end to the consumer optimism seen at the beginning of the year, says
a survey of consumer confidence.
Gallup says in its latest survey, completed before the announcement of a
rise in unemployment in January, that 51 per cent of adults expect
unemployment to rise compared with 18 per cent who expect it to fall. The
balance of pessimists over optimists now stands at 33 per cent, 10 per cent
higher than last month.
Compared with the same period last year, however, Gallup reported that the
fear of unemployment has receded markedly. The survey was conducted for the
European Commission.
The number of people who expected their household's financial position to
improve over the next 12 months declined to 17 per cent in February, while
37 per cent thought it would worsen. The balance of the two is the lowest
recorded since April 1990.
Consumers were also pessimistic about general economic prospects. While 29
per cent of people thought the economic situation would improve over the
next 12 months, 35 per cent thought that it would deteriorate. Also, fewer
people see February as the right time to make a major purchase compared with
January.
'Given the optimism expressed in January this month's figures are rather
disappointing,' Gallup says. 'Moreover, with the recent announcement of a
rise in unemployment and the apparent realisation that people will be paying
more taxes come April, the figures could deteriorate further.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Mayhew clarifies Sinn Fein contacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government representatives have never been authorised to tell republican
leaders that Britain intended to withdraw from Ulster, Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
But he did not deny that an indication to that effect might have been given
to Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein at an unauthorised meeting. The
government has acknowledged that two unauthorised meetings did take place.
Sir Patrick's comments came before a BBC TV programme last night which
claimed a government representative had told Mr McGuinness at a meeting
three days after last year's Warrington bombing that Britain's long-term
intention was to pull out.
Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: 'Nobody has ever been
authorised to say on behalf of the British government that the British
government intends to withdraw from Northern Ireland.'
A previously released Sinn Fein account of the meeting - said to have taken
place on March 23 last year - made no reference to a signal from the British
representative that Britain might withdraw.
Sinn Fein's account does refer to remarks by the representative to the
effect that 'the final solution is union'.
The representative said that Sir Patrick wanted Sinn Fein to play a part in
achieving a settlement for the province 'not because he likes Sinn Fein but
because it cannot work without them'.
'Any settlement not involving all of the people North and South won't work,'
Sinn Fein's note added.

FT  22 FEB 94 / 500 VSEL jobs to go at Barrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shipbuilder VSEL yesterday said a further 500 jobs would be cut in its
rolling programme at its nuclear submarine yard in Barrow-in-Furness,
Cumbria. The jobs will go by May.
A workforce of 6,000 will continue on the three remaining Trident submarine
contracts and an order for the AS90 self-propelled gun for the army. Two
Vanguard class submarines (above) have already been completed.
VSEL said earlier predictions that the number of workers would eventually
decline to 5,000 were still expected to be accurate.
Mr Ray Davies, the company's personnel director, said: 'We regret very much
having to make today's announcement, but I think that people now appreciate
that we have no alternative other than to respond to our reducing workload
if we are to remain competitive.'
The yard's workforce has been cut from 14,000 during the past three years in
a town heavily reliant on shipbuilding.
Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said the cut was not unexpected as VSEL had been warning
of further job losses.
The cuts highlighted the need for the government to help defence-related
companies diversify, he said. 'It is difficult to argue with the management
to retain people when there is no work.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Planner warns against 'loosening green belts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guidelines to strengthen the green belts of rural land encircling some of
the largest cities were published yesterday by the government.
The consultation document was greeted warily by environmentalists, who fear
that the proposals could encourage more development.
Mr Tony Burton, senior planner at the Council for the Protection of Rural
England, said: 'The government's tinkering with these rules risks loosening
the green belt.'
Green belts are areas around cities in which permission for new development
is tightly restricted. Local authorities are obliged to take the
government's guidelines into account when preparing development plans.
Mr David Curry, planning minister, launching the revised draft of the
planning policy guidance on green belts yesterday, said: 'The changes we
have made to the original guidance note are designed to . . . (make) greater
allowances for environmental and economic factors and to (address) practical
difficulties in operating it.'
Mr Curry added that research conducted for the Department of the Environment
last year concluded that the rural appearance of land within the green belts
was being upheld.
Publication of the document follows an attack by Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, on 'urban sprawl' and the construction of new shopping centres
outside towns.
The consultation paper wants 'to permit existing buildings in the green belt
to be re-used, whether or not they are redundant, subject to stringent
safeguards'. It also recommends that local authorities be allowed to re-use
'pre-war factories and power stations'.
The CPRE fears this could open the door to more development of derelict
sites in rural areas. It also accused the report of drawing green-belt
boundaries too loosely around urban areas.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, said: 'The government's
failure to bring in a register of contaminated land, coupled with
uncertainty (among bankers, insurers and developers) about the exact
situation on liability for pollution means that people have no encouragement
to develop derelict land in urban areas.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Drive launched to cut trade deficit in building materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A review designed to reduce the UK's large trade deficit in building
materials has been launched by the construction industry and the government.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said 'a group of important clients,
contractors and producers' working with his department had formed a task
force to combat the level of imports.
He said: 'The substantial trade deficit in building materials has persisted
throughout the recession. It must now be attacked.'
The task force, which was formed at the end of last year, has been asked to
produce by the autumn a development programme to run for up to 18 months to
identify products with the highest import penetration.
The task force will then work with the individual industry to try to improve
the position, said Mr Gummer.
The annual building material trade deficit fell from Pounds 2.56bn to Pounds
1.73bn between 1988 and 1992, and is thought to have declined further last
year.
Up to half the deficit is in timber, including much hardwood not grown in
the UK.
There is more concern about imports of manufactured products such as
air-conditioning equipment and decorative floor and wall tiles. Imports of
such products have remained high even though they could easily be produced
in Britain.
The issue of building materials imports was highlighted by ministers at the
height of construction boom in the late 1980s when even bricks had to be
imported to meet domestic shortfalls.
Brick manufacturers subsequently invested Pounds 200m to increase capacity
only to be overtaken by the recession. This forced them to close works and
kilns no longer required because of the sharp fall in construction demand.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Institute says tax rises will delay upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax rises will slow the pace of the recovery, but not for a year to 18
months, says a study from the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research published yesterday.
In its latest economic review, the institute says growth will be supported
during the next 12 to 18 months by the impact of lower interest rates and
the devaluation of the pound that has occurred since 1992. These factors
will outweigh the effects of this April's tax increases.
From then on the burden of higher taxes will dominate, assuming that 'there
is no relaxation in policy', and the influence of taxes will continue to be
felt for some 'considerable time to come'.
The institute predicts that the economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year,
just ahead of government forecasts.
But growth next year will slow to 2.6 per cent, below the government's
prediction of 2.75 per cent, and growth is then predicted to drop towards
2.25 per cent, significantly lower than the chancellor's medium-term
projection of 3 per cent.
Inflation is forecast to be running at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent by the
end of this year and is expected to rise to 4.6 per cent by the end of 1995,
well outside the government's target range of 2 per cent to 4 per cent.
The institute sees interest rates being cut to 5 per cent in the second
quarter of this year, possibly in April to coincide with the tax increases,
but then rising to 6.5 per cent in the medium term to counter the rise in
inflation.
The institute's is the second influential study to be published within a
week which expresses misgivings about the government's growth targets.
Last Friday the London Business School predicted that tax rises would cause
growth to slow to 2.2 per cent in 1995, after 2.5 per cent this year. Both
the institute and the London Business School have representatives on the
chancellor's panel of independent advisers, the so-called 'wise men', whose
latest report is due tomorrow.
However, the institute does find some reasons to be optimistic about the
state of the UK economy.
'It is too soon to speak confidently of a general improvement in the
underlying performance of the economy, but there are indeed some encouraging
signs,' the report says.
In particular, productivity is rising unusually quickly and wages and prices
have shown an unusually subdued response to the sharp fall in the exchange
rate.
The institute says the UK has made improvements in economic efficiency.
It says that 'in some industries a better performance and use of resources
is obvious'.
It is this improvement in efficiency, combined with a shift in policy
priorities towards greater price stability, that has given the UK an
inflation prospect which, it says, now compares favourably with those of
other countries.
Unemployment, according to the institute, will level off to about 2.5m, a
'disappointingly high figure', with a considerable change towards part-time
employment and the majority of these part-time jobs being filled by women.
It expects to see a significant rise in company spending on investment and
on stocks. Although it sees real personal disposable income barely rising
thanks to Budget tax rises and spending cuts, the savings ratio is expected
to fall again quite sharply thanks to increased asset prices and an improved
employment out-look.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Jordan says unions boost productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade unions are now 'a positive force for change' in making the
country's industry globally competitive, a senior union leader said last
night.
But workers needed the legal right to workplace representation that their
counterparts in Germany and Japan have if industry is to achieve a new
partnership between capital and labour, said Mr Bill Jordan, president of
the AEEU, the country's largest manufacturing union.
'A legal right to representation at the place of work would be a giant step
towards eradicating the British disease instead of just suppressing the
symptoms as successive governments have done. Good legislation is a catalyst
for change,' Mr Jordan said in a speech in London.
He emphasised that this was 'not the same thing as a right to recognition
for unions', while admitting that 'if the British tradition were followed,
it would generally mean representation by a union'.
But if that caused non-union employers to look at the thinking and practice
of modern trade unionism they 'would discover Britain's biggest industrial
world-class companies are overwhelmingly unionised'.
Mr Jordan said unions were good for employers because they helped to raise
productivity through co-operation in flexible working - such as at carmakers
Rover and Toyota - and by the removal of fears among workers.
He stressed the need for unions to drop 'the ideology of confrontation' and
accept that they had 'a shared interest in the success of the company'.
'Unions must be active advocates of the long-term strategy of combining
security with competitiveness,' he said.

MPs spent a total of 94 hours in the process of voting during the last
parliamentary session, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said
yesterday. He was rebutting Labour calls for the introduction of electronic
voting.
Mr Newton said the prospect of such voting 'would not command universal
support'.
Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, had called for voting
machines to be introduced on the grounds that it was time the Commons was
'dragged into the 20th century'.
He was supported by Ms Kate Hoey, Labour MP for Vauxhall, who asked whether
it was sensible to devote the equivalent of nearly four days of a
parliamentary session in voting procedures.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Senior Tory MP criticises MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Conservative MP has criticised the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in calling for a comprehensive review of UK competition policy,
David Owen writes.
Mr John Watts, chairman of the Treasury select committee, yesterday used a
Westminster meeting to urge a 'thorough investigation into the British
process for regulating competition'.
'There was a time when the great and the good could be relied on to
interpret the public interest according to a widely held consensus view,' Mr
Watts said, arguing that recent MMC reports 'clearly demonstrate that this
is not the case today'.
'British industry deserves better of its regulators,' he said.
The MP for Slough was supported by Mr Stephen Locke, director of the
Consumers' Association policy unit, who said there was 'considerable
duplication of activity' by the MMC, the Office of Fair Trading and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
'Each of these bodies has a learning curve whenever it tackles a new issue
and knowledge and expertise does not appear to be shared,' Mr Locke said.
'The new proposal for greater consultation by the DTI might exacerbate the
situation.'
Mr Locke was particularly critical about the findings of MMC reports into
the brewing and perfume industries.
He said the inconsistency of such reports was partly due to panellists being
part-timers and to 'very unclear' guidelines on what constituted the public
interest.'
The DTI said yesterday it would examine what Mr Watts had to say before
commenting further.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Advertising by Church gets go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England was yesterday given approval to launch advertising
campaigns with other churches to spread the Christian message.
Internal policymakers ruled there was no ethical bar to advertising -
provided it was used in co-operation with other denominations. They said
advertising could be a 'creative, effective, appropriate, even amusing'
means of getting the Christian message across. But it should only be used as
part of an overall communications strategy.
A report by a working party of the Church of England's Communications
Committee found there was no agreed plan between dioceses.
It said: 'Since the communication of the Christian Gospel is of paramount
importance we find this state of affairs to be a matter of deep regret. The
church gives far too low a priority to its thinking and budgeting on
reaching those who do not hear its message.'
The working party, which was set up to consider the ethical and theological
considerations of advertising, was chaired by Canon Colin Semper, a former
BBC head of religious broadcasting. Its members included a moral theologian,
an advertising agent, a diocesan communications officer and the director of
the Roman Catholic Communications Centre.
The Rt Rev Nigel McCulloch, bishop of Wakefield and chairman of the church's
communications committee, said: 'This report is seminal. It identifies the
key questions to be asked about the use of advertising and suggests
guidelines for the church.'
A Church of England priest yesterday failed in his challenge to the legality
of the ordination of women priests.
The Rev Paul Williamson, priest-in-charge of St George's, Hanworth, west
London, asked for a High Court injunction to stop members of the General
Synod voting through the change at a meeting today.
Mr Justice Popplewell rejected the application and refused Mr Williamson
permission to seek a judicial review.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Oftel moves against music charts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading has referred the system for compiling the Top 40
and other music charts to the Restrictive Practices Court.
The OFT's action follows a complaint from Gallup, the polling organisation,
which lost the contract to compile the charts at the beginning of this
month.
Gallup argues that it should still have access to retailers' sales data so
that it can compile an alternative to the official charts.
The OFT said it had referred to the court the current chart compiling system
and the contract previously held by Gallup. The OFT said the present and
previous arrangements appeared to be based on restrictive practices, and it
would ask the court whether they operated against the public interest. The
case is expected to last several years.
The contract to compile the charts is awarded by Chart Information Network,
an organisation jointly owned by the British Phonographic Industry, the
music companies' trade body, and Spotlight Publications, which publishes
Music Week. Spotlight is owned by United Newspapers.
Gallup held the contract to compile music charts from 1983 until the end of
January this year. CIN said it decided to award the contract to Millward
Brown, a rival research company, because it offered a cheaper service than
Gallup.
CIN said Millward Brown also promised to use more advanced technology than
Gallup, allowing the information for the chart to be registered at the same
time as a musical recording was sold.
Gallup's technology had meant that sales and chart information were
registered separately.
CIN collects sales information from the British Association of Record
Dealers, which is made up of most music retail chains and the larger
independent outlets.
Ms Catharine Pusey, CIN's charts director, said her organisation's contract
with the association specified that only CIN may receive sales data for the
purpose of compiling music charts. CIN does not give the information to any
company other than Millward Brown.
The OFT said it rejected a request from Gallup to declare invalid the
agreement between CIN and the record dealers. The OFT said Gallup had
benefited from a similar arrangement when it had held the chart contract.
Mr John Pinder, Gallup's charts director, said Gallup had never requested
the exclusive right to compile the charts.
