FT  18 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Bundesbank cuts rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank loves to tease. Certainly, the half a percentage point cut in
the discount rate announced yesterday was surprising to many, at least as to
timing. The first question this cut raises then is what it means. The second
is whether the Bundesbank's monetary policy makes sense.
One thing it shows is that the interest rate trend remains downwards. It
also indicates that the rate of decline has slowed. Between early February
1993 and yesterday, the discount rate was cut by 3 percentage points. But
the last cut prior to yesterday's was almost four months ago, on October 22
last year.
This relatively lengthy delay is only one reason for believing the
Bundesbank has become very cautious about the pace, and perhaps the extent,
of easing. There are two others: first, the Lombard rate has been left at 6
3/4 per cent, so returning the spread between the two benchmark rates to 1
1/2 percentage points; second the repo rate has been left at 6 per cent,
where it has been since December last year. Although the cut has given the
Bundesbank room for manoeuvre, it suggests no great urgency in actually
making cuts. But one benefit it gains by acting now is the ability to lower
market rates of interest during any strike by the engineering workers, while
avoiding publicity.
The cut also demonstrates that the Bundesbank is not rigidly monetarist.
With M3 growing at an annualised rate of 8.1 per cent, such a Bundesbank
would have no case for easing. Aware of the problem, it argues that the
monetary figures have been distorted by exceptional credit demand due to the
increased taxes. Arguing away inconvenient M3 figures is no new experience
for the Bundesbank. It has become an art form.
At least since unification, there has been no sensible alternative. The
divergence between the monetary numbers and virtually all other indicators
has made that inescapable. The money numbers may be growing fast, but
seasonally-adjusted consumer price inflation has fallen to an annual rate of
2 1/2 per cent over the past six months. This decline in inflation largely
reflects the rapid decline in wage inflation. With industrial output in
December 1993 still 11 per cent below its peak in February 1992 and showing
virtually no sign of recovery, workers have little choice.
Under the presidency of Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank may prove more
'pragmatic' and less 'monetarist' than under his predecessor, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger. But the difference from one president to the next is far more
one of degree than of kind.
The fundamental question, however, is whether the Bundesbank has been
getting these pragmatic judgments right. With disinflationary pressures
strong and the monetary stance, judged by the shape of the yield curve, no
more than neutral, yesterday's cut underlines the caution of German monetary
policy. Given what happened at the time of unification, that is
understandable. But it looks excessive, nonetheless.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Action] . . . . . . and cut: Martin Dickson on the tasks
facing Paramount's new bosses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Chips, a high-budget movie about skulduggery in college basketball,
starring square-jawed actor Nick Nolte and real-life basketball star
Shaquille O'Neal, opens across the US tonight, and early reviews suggest it
could end a run of disappointing box office returns for Hollywood studio
Paramount Pictures. In the words of The Hollywood Reporter, a movie industry
newspaper, it's a 'slammin'-jammin' saga'.
Nobody will be hoping so more fervently than Mr Sumner Redstone, the
70-year-old chairman of cable television group Viacom, who on Monday night
won an epic, five-month takeover battle for Paramount Communications. The
group owns the Hollywood studio as well as book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster
and a host of other entertainment interests, yet has had lacklustre
financial results for years.
The takeover, together with Viacom's related acquisition of video rental
retailer Blockbuster Entertainment, transforms the group from being a
fast-growing but medium-sized (revenues of Dollars 2bn) cable television
programming and services company into an entertainment giant (revenues of
Dollars 8bn), alongside rivals such as Time Warner and Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News International.
According to Viacom, this new 'global media powerhouse' will be strongly
placed to take advantage of a boom in the world entertainment market, due to
the development of multi-media interactive television in the west and the
collapse of communism in the east.
Yet for all these fine words, Mr Redstone and Mr Frank Biondi, Viacom's
athletic, 49-year-old chief executive, have just taken on one of the most
daunting jobs facing an American management team.
They must sharply improve the Paramount group's performance to justify the
high price paid for the company: at Dollars 9.7bn, the winning bid is some
Dollars 2bn more than many observers think Paramount is worth.
At the same time, they face the extremely intricate task of merging not two,
but three corporate cultures and management systems, thanks to the January
agreement under which Viacom is buying Blockbuster in return for Blockbuster
providing cash to support its Paramount bid.
The takeover of Blockbuster could still fall apart or need renegotiation,
because Blockbuster shareholders, who must approve the deal, are unhappy at
the plunge in the price of Viacom's stock - the currency in which they are
being paid - since the merger terms were agreed.
Mr Redstone needs Blockbuster's strong cash flow and balance sheet to
bolster the finances of a heavily indebted Viacom-Paramount combination,
which Wall Street reckons would generate enough cash to cover its annual
interest payments about twice.
Mr Redstone has shown in the past that he can successfully handle high
levels of indebtedness: when he acquired Viacom - best known for MTV, the
pop music cable television network, and Nickelodeon, a channel for children
 -seven years ago for Dollars 3.2bn, he took on Dollars 2.8bn of debt. Yet
he has presided over a period of rapid growth without selling off the
group's assets.
And if Viacom eventually needs to cut its leverage it could sell off bits of
the Paramount business, though Mr Redstone says there are no specific assets
for sale now.
Three central, inter-related tasks face the Redstone-Biondi team. The first
is to cut costs by combining jobs currently carried out separately by the
three businesses. For example, some corporate overheads will go, while the
cost of developing and distributing television programmes will be reduced by
combining some of these functions at MTV, Paramount and two small Hollywood
studios owned by Blockbuster, called Spelling and Republic. Mr Biondi
reckons this could produce annual cost savings of about Dollars 200m within
12 months.
The second is to improve Paramount's financial performance, and especially
that of Paramount Pictures, which for years has suffered from too many flops
of high-budget films, low staff morale and a revolving door of top
executives. Recent disappointments include the ghoulish comedy Addams Family
Values and a family drama, The Search for Bobby Fischer.
Big personnel changes seem certain. Mr Stanley Jaffe, who as president of
Paramount Communications is ultimately responsible for its entertainment
results, is not expected to stay at Viacom, which may also seek an eventual
replacement for Ms Sherry Lansing, Mr Jaffe's one-time business partner and
the Paramount studio head.
For now, Mr Biondi says: 'We have confidence in Sherry Lansing. We have
asked her to stay, and she's indicated she'd like to.'
Getting the right team to run Paramount Pictures may be the most important
single decision facing Viacom over the next few months, for while the studio
may account for only 10 per cent of the combined group's operating revenues,
it is widely regarded as the crucial element which may allow the group to
create synergy between its disparate elements - hit movies, spin-off books,
records and video-games.
Yet Mr Redstone and Mr Biondi themselves have no experience of running such
a volatile business as a film studio. They are known as efficient asset
managers, not creative artists.
The third challenge is to begin creating the cross-fertilisation between
Viacom, Paramount and Blockbuster which might justify the creation of Mr
Redstone's Dollars 9.7bn 'global powerhouse'. Initial plans include
persuading Paramount to make films featuring successful Viacom cable
television characters, such as MTV's teenage anti-heroes Beavis and
Butt-head.
Mr Redstone is also keen to follow the lead set by film-makers Walt Disney
and Warner Brothers and set up a a chain of 'studio stores' - glossy shops
featuring Viacom and Paramount film-related merchandise. Blockbuster, with
its sophisticated retailing management systems, would play an important role
in this ven-ture.
Wall Street, which generally favoured the strategy behind a Viacom-Paramount
bid, but initially questioned the wisdom of bringing Blockbuster into the
partnership, seems a little more inclined to accept the logic behind the
triple alliance.
'At the end of the day, a fully vertically integrated manufacturer and
distributor of audio, video and published copyright material, with
extraordinary marketing skills in reaching early users of new technologies,
should win,' according to Mr Christopher Dixon of broker PaineWebber.
But that is by no means a universal view, and the multi-media future for
which Mr Redstone is preparing remains a long way away and of uncertain
shape.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Picking up tab for ill-conceived
energy gimmick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr LG BROOKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox's article (Business and the Environment, February 16)
about funding the Energy Saving Trust by putting a surcharge on fuel bills
throws the spotlight on a thoroughly disreputable proposal.
The whole concept of centrally inspired energy efficiency is deeply flawed.
First, it presupposes that a whole host of microeconomic decisions can lead
to a predictable and desirable macroeconomic result. Second, it is neither
one thing nor the other: it does not lead to optimal economic resource
allocation, nor can it be the basis of targeted energy savings.
This is because its effects are unpredictable as well as being economically
sub-optimal.
Thus the economy as a whole is set to bear the burden of mis-allocation of
resources and individual fuel consumers - including those like me who
clearly see the flaws - are paraded to pick up the tab for an ill-conceived
gimmick.

Sir, Few would argue with Mr Martyn Jones's case (Letters, February 14) for
increasing the penalties faced by fraudsters who attempt to deceive
auditors. However, it is not unknown in the history of financial scandals
for auditors themselves to turn a blind eye to fraud by company directors,
from whom they often show insufficient independence.
Perhaps proposed criminal penalties should also apply to auditors who
knowingly conceal fraudulent transactions.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good reason for not investing in
upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr F. THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Tony Jackson ('Dangers of great expectations', February 12) seems to
be perplexed that UK industry is not currently investing more than it seems
to be doing in preparation for recovery from the recession. Perhaps my
company's policy on investment, which is based upon our experiences of the
last 14 years or so and which I believe to be typical of very many
businesses, might help him to understand.
The 1980s began with the government-engineered slaughter of manufacturing
industry and our order book at that time, like so many others, went over the
edge of a cliff. Those customers of ours which closed down overnight or went
bust accounted for more than 80 per cent of our turnover.
These happenings left in their wake a strong buyers' market with the
characteristically low prices of such a market and these still continue
today.
During this 14-year period we have suffered the financial problems of a
significant customer having gone into liquidation owing us a substantial sum
of money; this has happened on three occasions and each time, perhaps more
significantly, it has meant the end of yet another source of orders. During
the same period we have worked at normal capacity for barely five years.
Manufacturing industry is continuing to contract at quite a pace so that to
maintain our sales level we have to get at least two new customers a month
and at the moment we are nearly three years into another recession which
none of the 'experts' quite seems to understand.
While we will certainly always meet any demands which our customers may make
upon us we will not spend money on creating additional production capacity
'in preparation for recovery' until we can be reasonably sure that we can
make a good enough margin to cover us for the risks associated with a
contracting industry and the seemingly endless blundering with the economy
by the government.
Jackson may think it 'curious', but our view is that it does not matter how
cheap money is and how low a figure inflation has come down to; these are
minor factors which do not come into our discussions on such matters as
these.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Venture capitalists must be more
realistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RW KITZINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Unhappy returns' (Management, February 9), warning that
many companies are in danger of under-investing, has particular relevance to
the venture capital industry.
In our experience many venture capital fund managers, when negotiating with
unquoted companies with a view to investing in them, will state that they
are seeking internal rates of return of more than 30 per cent.
These rates have remained broadly unchanged and unchallenged for many years
in spite of recent substantial falls in the real cost of money.
The venture capital industry needs to adapt to the present cost of money if
it is to increase its deal flow to compete with those trade purchasers which
have adjusted.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Ugly face of naked power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are all the same, these politicians. They only want one thing. Power.
We are vouchsafed few details about what they're going to do with it, just
that they yearn to be in charge. The demotic question to keep in mind when
one of them addresses you - 'why is this lying bastard lying to me?' - is
really no question at all. It answers itself - 'because he, or she, wants to
have his, or her, wicked way with my vote'. If it had been asked and
answered in April 1992, when the Tories produced their now notorious false
prospectus on taxation, Mr Neil Kinnock might be UK prime minister today.
Think of that.
Mr John Smith, Mr Kinnock's successor, shows every sign that he does think
about it, and that he will never forget the lesson. At the next election,
Labour apparently plans to tell the smallest amount of truth it can possibly
get away with. It will say next to nothing about what the party proposes to
do if it wins, and less about what its unstated plans might cost. Tough. It
would make no odds if Mr Smith was more forthcoming. The differences between
the parties are not earth-shattering.
The Conservatives, who have enjoyed office for 14 years, seek to extend
their empire of patronage whenever they can. Survival apart, they have
practically nothing else on their minds. Labour, scenting victory, plots
against its natural allies, the Liberal Democrats, so that the latter do not
stand in the way of an overall majority. Unduly excited by the government's
present nadir of unpopularity, the people's party dreams of absolute power,
to be granted by the voters with the generous addition of a blank cheque.
Lib Dem successes would blur this fantasy. Winner-takes-all would lose its
charm if there were one-and-a-half winners, or a tiresome list of specific
promises to deliver.
When it comes to the broad thrust of policy, there is not much of a choice.
The Tories have perfected the trickle-up theory of economic management,
shifting income and wealth from poor to rich. Labour might be expected to
redress the balance by a whisker or so, but not much more because that would
be inconsistent with Mr Smith's strategy of repositioning it as the party of
'ordinary people' rather than 'the poor'. The Tories are attempting to
obliterate all centres of power save Whitehall, which they regard as their
natural fiefdom. Labour, which dominates Scotland and often wins local
elections, would partially reverse the process. The leaders of both parties
are contenders for first prize in the elective dictatorship stakes. They are
job-seekers before anything else.
Further evidence of the naked ambition of our politicians came this week. On
Tuesday, the police and magistrates court bill ran into more trouble in the
House of Lords. Thank heavens. The bill would pack local police authorities
with Tory puppets nominated by the government. This is getting to be a
habit. There must be a Ministry of Strings somewhere. In the bill's original
form the home secretary would have had the power to appoint the chairmen,
but that was too much for Lord Whitelaw, who scuppered it. He was, however,
prevailed upon to support the government's amendments to the bill, which
would give the minister power to appoint sufficient members of the
authorities to get the chairmanships sewn up in another way. It would all
have been done with the deceptive phraseology of amendment 27, which would
enable the government to appoint people 'from a list of persons compiled in
accordance with an order made by the secretary of state'. What weasels our
parliamentary draughtsmen are]
In a debate that should become a set-piece for students of the history of
liberty in Britain, Lord McIntosh, for Labour, exposed the sham. If a list
was compiled in accordance with the home secretary's or-der, and then the
home secretary made the appointment from that list, he had the whole
responsibility in his hands. Other speakers pointed out the partisan nature
of the proposal, which would nationalise the British police. It came out of
the ministerial head. No royal commission sat, no select committee voted,
nobody outside the Conservative party dreamed it up. None of the 360
organisations that expressed an opinion backed the government.
Lord Rippon cited the liberal economist FA Hayek in support of the
contention that 'you cannot have real, effective democracy without real,
effective local government'. This should be engraved on the hearts of our
Conservative, supposedly Hayekian, cabinet ministers. Outnumbered on its own
side, the government withdrew its amendments; it will doubtless apply
further devilish cunning in an effort to secure its original intent.
Labour's perception that it may be destined to rule again in solitary glory
was also revealed this week. The death of the Conservative MP Stephen
Milligan will mean a by-election in the southern constituency of Eastleigh.
In the natural course of events, this would be won by the Lib Dems. In 1992,
they captured 28 per cent of the vote against Labour's 21 per cent.
Following the pattern of recent by-elections, and assuming a comparatively
low swing against the government, tactical voting would put almost any Lib
Dem candidate in the Commons.
Assume, however, that the voters are led in a different direction. Forget
about the advantage accruing to the Lib Dems because they start ahead of
Labour. Recall that Labour did better, and the Lib Dems worse, in 1992 than
1987. Then a projection of opinion poll figures for all three parties puts
Labour in. Mr Smith has decided to go for broke. If he succeeds, he will
have demonstrated his party can win down south. The Lib Dems, most of whose
policies Labour has already borrowed, would become redundant.
The gamble is huge: splitting the anti-Tory vote could give the
Conservatives a much-needed victory. Bewitched by the prospect of sweeping
all before him, the Labour leader is clearly prepared to risk that. Can it
be that in the eyes of Mrs Margaret Beckett, his steely deputy, even a Tory
victory would be better than a Lib Dem advance, provided only that Labour
moved from third to second place?
Never mind what they say, these gamblers at the high table of power, watch
what they do. We have to accept their governance when they win, but oh what
a joy it is to see them, any of them, go down.

Sir, As you say in your leader, 'Lining the executive nest' (February 14),
it is clear that shareholder power is no real check on excessive executive
remuneration.
A more credible system of assessment is needed. One system would be to
include representatives of employees on the assessment panel, for example
through a German-style system of supervisory boards. The pros and cons of a
two-tier board system do, of course, raise very wide issues, but this
episode does remind us that a fresh debate on the respective roles of the
different stakeholders in the governance of the company is long overdue.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Iceland's changing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRIDRIK SOPHUSSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the article 'Iceland's trade policy 'to blame for downturn' '
(February 11), Frances Williams introduced a report by two General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade economists on the Icelandic economy. The Icelandic
economy is not an everyday issue in the international media. Therefore, I
feel it is important that when it is examined the evaluation gives an
accurate picture of our situation.
The article focuses on that part of the Gatt report which deals with the
past and gives a fairly thorough estimate of what we could have done better.
This is all very well but it does not reflect the present state of affairs
in Iceland.
Allow me to dwell on that for a moment. Despite stagnation since 1988, the
Icelandic economy has undergone significant structural changes, not least in
agriculture and the fisheries. The capital markets have been liberalised,
the tax system has been completely reformed and the public sector has been
down-sized. At the same time marked improvements can be noted in the
economic field; inflation has been brought down from double-digit figures to
1-2 per cent; the current account is in balance and the fiscal deficit is
well below the OECD average.
These facts are at least an indication of the present state of the Icelandic
economy. I would be the first to acknowledge that there are many things
still to be done but there are also a great many issues that have been
successfully addressed.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Roots still in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs GILLIAN DARLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your survey of Housing Associations (February 15) I was interested
to see Octavia Hill cited as a key figure in the establishment of the
housing association movement.
As her biographer, and until recently a committee member of a large London
housing association, I see all the trends described in your survey as
rapidly taking the movement away from its roots. The kind of community-based
housing action that Octavia Hill and those housing professionals of the next
generation that she trained believed in is under threat and only survives,
to any extent, in Scotland.
Had you featured the Glasgow housing association movement, for example, you
could have demonstrated that value for money produces architectural quality,
job creation, children's playgrounds and a high degree of tenant involvement
at every level - the very things that Octavia Hill promoted.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Hungarians at odds with soloist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the war the Hungarian State Symphony Orchestra could proudly claim
that it worked with some of the leading conductors of the day, including
Ansermet, Klemperer, Walter and Busch. All that changed with the cold war,
when even the best of the eastern European orchestras found themselves on
the sidelines.
To judge from its Barbican concert on Wednesday, the Hungarian State
Symphony Orchestra is not really one of their number these days. Top
orchestras from Prague and Dresden, St. Petersburg and Leipzig have shown
what they can do in London; the Hungarians, for all their virtues, cannot
match that level of style and sound quality.
The orchestra's principal conductor is Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi, who took up his
post in 1987. He may run up to the podium with a spring in his step, but
unfortunately his physical energy does not always communicate itself to the
performances. Wagner's Overture to Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg was played
with studied grandeur, as though he wanted us to be sure that this was
serious music-making.
In Brahms's Violin Concerto there were two performances going on: Kobayashi
and the orchestra anxious never to sound anything other than measured and
sober, the soloist Lydia Mordkovitch always wanting to ignite sparks of
passion from the violin bow, if she could. In all the more agitated passages
Mordkovitch was inclined to overheat the emotion without respite, but she
had life and made every note count. I was glad she was there.
Moving on to Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, Kobayashi and his Hungarian
players were released from any duty to try to sound teutonic. The conductor
allowed more urgency and speed. The playing found more attack. In its
combination of a fairly big string sound, bright but not strident brass,
able if self-effacing wind, the orchestra has some strengths on its side.
The red-blooded flair that closed the finale showed that Kobayashi has
tasted paprika in the last seven years, after all.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: The Life of Galileo - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) died while rehearsing the model production of his
Life of Galileo. It remains one of his most lucid plays, written in November
1938; now it has a new gloss in David Hare's version at the Almeida Theatre,
which makes absorbing, engaging drama.
The play starts with the battle between Ptolemy's crystal spheres view of
the universe centred on the earth, and Copernicus's sun-centred model. John
Donne caught the feeling of the time: 'The sun is lost, and the earth, and
no man's wit can well direct him where to look for it.' The two dates in
Galileo's life (1564-1642), which form the axis of the play are 1610, when
he published The Starry Messenger about his discoveries in astronomy, and
1633 when he recanted at Rome the Copernican theories he had held.
As Galileo and Rome take a collision course, the play's broader issues
evolve: the uses of scepticism and the uses of science; the merits of
science and religion for the uneducated; the worth of knowledge; and the
possession of truth, 'the child of time and not the prisoner of authority'.
Behind, Brecht - but not Hare - is the great debate between the Baconian and
Aristotelian views of science. The equivalent debates now can be found in
genetic engineering and computer information. Rome's attitude then is like
political correctness now: think but don't say.
Brecht wrote an accessible play about ideas, staging them and making
discovery exciting. Hare has stayed in that tradition, trimming down the
play and updating its feel while still keeping the action in 17th-century
Italy. Both offer, as Brecht wanted, 'a workable picture of the world'.
At the Almeida, the cast is strong and centred on a very fine performance by
Richard Griffiths as Galileo. He ages Galileo 30 years from the discontented
46 year old of the opening to the disillusioned man under house arrest at
the close.
Griffiths has the ability to find voices within Galileo, throwaway lines or
comments which are still part of the character; he finds broad gestures for
Galileo, almost vulgar, as befits Brecht's portrayal of a man taking the
easy course and applying his learning indiscriminately.
Around him, Michael Gough and Alfred Burke are pillars of Roman cynicism and
prejudice, while Edward de Souza and Jerome Willis are a brace of clubbable
cardinals.
Jonathan Kent's direction keeps the action cerebral and finds images of
light and dark in the excellent set (Tobias Hoheisel) without recourse to
laboratory paraphernalia. Behind the wooden screens that become the courts,
houses and lecture rooms of Galileo's life, the curved wall of the Almeida
Theatre is a celestial blue dappled with golden stars. Jonathan Dove's
ambient music creates a sense of distance and perspective.
Hare - and Brecht - know that Galileo recanted his theories in order to stay
alive to write more. Griffiths' quiet defence of Galileo's decision draws
the play together at the end; he was a man unable to resist an old wine or a
new idea.
At the Almeida Theatre (071 359 4404) until March 31

FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Ireland's heritage is on the move - Thanks to a
windfall from the Irish government, the National Museum of Ireland has been
given a historic building on the banks of the Liffey. Patricia Morison talks
to the museum's director, Patrick Wallace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Museum of Ireland has been given the go-ahead for what its
director, Dr Patrick Wallace, describes as 'the most important change for
this museum in a hundred years'. The museum is to take over Collins
Barracks, a well-known legacy of British rule, opposite the Guinness Brewery
on the River Liffey.
Founded in 1877, the museum on Kildare Street, across the courtyard from the
Irish parliament, is best known for incomparable gold from the Bronze Age
and for such superb medieval Celtic treasures as the Tara Brooch, St
Patrick's Bell, and the Ardagh Chalice. However, only a tiny fraction of the
museum's collections can be shown. The enormous collection of Irish folk
life, which Wallace calls 'a remarkable testament to the dignity of
poverty', has never been out of storage.
For five years, parts of the museum have been closed for repairs and
renovations. Designed by Sir Thomas Deane and opened in 1899, it is slowly
reemerging as a delightfully pretty and intact example of Victorian museum
design. There is a grand central gallery roofed in iron and glass, long
mock-Tudor galleries with hammer-beam roofs, and colourful majolica doorways
made in Leeds. But the problems remained: acute lack of space and, with only
half a million visitors a year, a worryingly inconspicuous place in
Ireland's cultural life.
A new dawn was signalled in last month's budget. Finance minister Bertie
Ahern unexpectedly announced that the museum would be given Collins Barracks
and a IPounds 10m renovation grant. The IPounds 10m came from a
controversial tax amnesty recently introduced for Irish tax-dodgers. Michael
D. Higgins, Ireland's first minister for the arts, then announced an
additional IPounds 15m grant from the EC's European Structural Fund.
Wallace had hopes of getting his hands on Collins Barracks but had not dared
to be optimistic. In the 1980s, the museum was told it would be taking over
the beautiful 18th-century Royal Hospital at Kilmainham. There was bitter
disappointment when the government instead made it the modern art museum.
Now Wallace has IPounds 25m and an historic 17-acre site in a part of west
Dublin which, although run-down, is attractive and has considerable tourist
potential. Originally called the Royal Barracks, Collins Barracks was built
between 1701 and 1706 and is still in use by the Irish army, making it the
oldest continually occupied barracks in Europe. A pleasing facade is visible
from the busy roads along the banks of Liffey, but few Dubliners have ever
been inside.
Thomas Burgh, the first architect, also designed Trinity College Library and
Dr Stevens' Hospital. His covered riding school survives, also Pierce Square
and Clarke Square, dignified great courtyards surrounded by four-storey
blocks of soldiers' accommodation, pierced by huge archways. Extra floors
were added in the last century, and at its peak, the barracks housed 500
horses and 5,000 soldiers. Conditions were dreadful and cholera was rife.
In the next few months, the army will leave and work will start to turn
Collins Barracks into a repository for a rich variety of Ireland's heritage.
The narrow rooms of the Clarke Square building will house European
decorative arts; Georgian silver, Irish lace, ceramics, and fine Irish
furniture. Wallace plans to have a temporary exhibition up by the end of the
year. Some of next year's major celebration of the Vikings in Ireland may
also be exhibited there.
Wallace is keenly aware of the potential offered by the gaunt old barracks
as a museum for militaria and a shrine to Irish republicanism. Local
tradition has it that 'the Curlies', revolutionaries killed in the abortive
1798 rising, were buried on the green esplanade beneath the barracks. Arbour
Hill is right behind, and the churchyard with the impressive memorial to the
martyrs of the 1916 Easter Rising.
Militaria, musical instruments, coins, stamps, carriages, and scientific
instruments will have their galleries, as well as the ethnographic
collection. The doctor on Captain Cook's second voyage was a Dubliner who
brought back Maori treasures, which have not been exhibited for 25 years.
Conservation workshops are urgently needed and eventually, there will be
crafts' workshops.
The heart of the site will be a IPounds 11m purpose-built museum. The
architects will be the Office of Public Works, which converted the Royal
Hospital at Kilmainham and the new building will be able to take in
travelling museum shows. 'Ireland has never got the blockbusters,
Tutenkhamun or Benin bronzes, but now that will change,' says Wallace.
Wallace plans to keep Kildare Street for Irish antiquities. Ireland's
exceptional archaeological heritage (a Viking gold necklace was dug up only
last week) will easily fill the old building. The most controversial issue
is the fate of the huge collection illustrating Ireland's vanishing folk
traditions.
Wallace wants it for Collins Barracks, to give an 'upstairs-downstairs' view
of Irish social history. 'The Ireland from which the millions went over the
world, it's all there, our folk beliefs, superstitions, regional
traditions.' The arts minister is said to favour creating a new rural museum
at Daingean in County Offaly.
Wallace's plans will cost substantially more than IPounds 25m, not least for
more staff. Museum charges may well have to be introduced. In the past,
fund-raising from Irish business and private individuals has brought small
rewards. As Wallace ruefully comments: 'Irish millionaires want a winner at
the Curragh and an actress.' Yet he also detects a change in public
attitudes in the past few years and a new curiosity to discover something
about Ireland's heritage. The proof of that will be what happens now at
Collins Barracks.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Trumpeter in winning form - Music in London / David
Murray reviews the London Mozart Players and John Wallace's performance of
Birtwistle's 'Endless Parade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with the trumpeter John Wallace as their soloist on Wednesday, the
London Mozart Players (now resident in Croydon) were put upon their mettle.
In Harrison Birtwistle and in Leopold Mozart, Wallace was in such winning
form that it was doubly impressive of the LMP to make their virtues register
so well in the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Their conductor Matthias Bamert had a
lot to do with that.
At the end of their programme, in Schubert's Symphony no. 6 - the 'little' C
major - Bamert could still draw fresh, cheerful playing from them, athletic
and candid: just what that earlyish work needs to make its best effects. At
the start, accompanying Philippa Davies' imaginative flute in Bach's B minor
Suite with strings, he was a creative partner; he found an unpedantic lilt
for all the dance-rhythms, including an uncommonly sinuous Minuet, and
conjured a darkly expressive backcloth for her Sarabande. For Miss Davies
that was plainly the introspective heart of the Suite, but we relished no
less her extrovert dash in the 'Double' of the Polonaise, and her feathery
brilliance in the Badinerie.
Birtwistle's Endless Parade (1987) has been called the best trumpet concerto
since Haydn's. That may well be right. There have been good-ish concerti for
the instrument, but usually there is a suspicion that their composers are
writing down - either because they think the trumpet has narrow expressive
limits, or because they feel expected to make the most of its strident gleam
and its vocal sexiness when muted.
Birtwistle's 20-minute piece is far more original. He rotates his basic
material through many different angles, exploiting his multiply divided
strings in swift, overlapping paragraphs. Though his trumpet remains a
'pure' trumpet, not a pretend-voice, it explores all the rich possibilities
of trumpet diction - in range, dynamics, articulation - as it soars through
and above the intricate string-inventions. After repeated hearings, Endless
Parade continues to fascinate and compel.
Naturally, nothing less than a superlative soloist will do. The original one
was Hakan Hardenberger, cool and superbly polished. Here, Wallace suppressed
his natural bent for vocal inflections in favour of open, shining tone,
keeping his subtleties strictly to the diction alone. That was marvellous to
hear: without swoops, shudders or smooches he stamped every passage with
speaking character, apt for each new twist in Birtwistle's score. After
that, the tidy little concerto by Mozart pere was a mere doddle. It has to
be squeezed out of a tiny D-trumpet, but Wallace did that with
straight-backed period elegance.

Friday nights are heavy on comedy and gardening. The BBC is currently
offering repeats of Only Fools And Horses where Del has plans for a
satellite TV company (8.00 BBC1); Red Dwarf, which now moves on to Series II
and introduces its best character, the robot Kryten (9.00 BBC2); and
Blackadder II, in which Blackadder and Lord Melchett are kidnapped (10.00
BBC2). On Channel 4 there is also Roseanne for those who find
defensive/aggressive fat people funny; and a new series of The Jack Dee Show
with the stand-up comedian who is now best known for the 'widget' beer
commercial (10.30).
Channel 4's repeat of the series Nature Perfected looks at Italian gardens
from the Renaissance onwards (9.00). As that ends BBC2 begins a new series
of Gardeners' World (9.30). Items include a dried herbaceous border created
by gardening photographer Andrew Lawson.
Friday is also film night. Best bet is the Clint Eastwood western High
Plains Drifter (10.20 BBC1) which, even in 1972, had all the violence and
vague supernaturalism that became Eastwood's trademarks.

FT  18 FEB 94 / People: MD moves from Electrolux to 'information warehouse'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kevin Walsh, appointed managing director of the new retail division of On
Demand Information, believes in wearing what he describes as 'visionary
spectacles'.
He will find them necessary in his new job where he will have to persuade
down-to-earth retailers that they can save money and sell more goods by
renting space in his 'information warehouse'.
ODI is a new kind of company, which floated on the London market last year.
Its founder, Graham Poulter, has developed an information system combining
sound, text and pictures on a screen - multimedia, in other words. The
retail division is about multimedia for the shop floor.
Walsh, only 40 years of age but a veteran of the retailing business, had
spells at Reed Group, Kenwood and Singer before spending seven years at
Electrolux where he is currently managing director of the domestic
appliances division. He likes the 'big group' feel of Electrolux, but the
challenge of being in at the beginning of a new industry persuaded him to
move to ODI.
He envisages retailers installing modified personal computers in their shops
able to receive over telephone lines a stream of information from the
'information warehouse' - essentially a large computer memory. Customers
will be able to inspect products on the screen, receive interactive training
in their use and order them directly from the manufacturer.
Walsh thinks that operations like ODI could render obsolete the use of
CD-ROM systems in electronic retailing.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology: Sugar cubes to virtual blood - A
three-dimensional simulator could soon be used to train British surgeons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TRAHERNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The technique of inserting a tiny camera and surgical instruments down tubes
into the human abdominal cavity - keyhole or laparoscopic surgery -
revolutionised operations in the mid-1980s when it was first used in the US.
Since then, the technique, which in most cases reduces scarring and cuts
post-operative recovery time, has swept through Europe. Today, some 75 per
cent of gall-bladder operations in the UK use laparoscopic techniques.
But this technology has required surgeons to develop new skills. They have
to perform a three-dimensional operation while watching a two-dimensional
television screen. Also, because the instruments pivot on the abdominal
wall, when the surgeon moves his hand to the right the instrument inside the
body moves to the left.
In some European countries, surgeons can practise these techniques on
anaesthetised animals. But in the UK, Home Office regulations prevent the
use of livestock. In the early days of laparoscopic surgery, British
surgeons travelled abroad to develop their skills. But to train in the UK,
in most cases, they have had to use laparoscopic trainers (surgical
instruments inserted into boxes) and practise on foodstuffs - for instance,
by stacking sugar cubes and stitching chicken legs.
But this could change under a joint initiative from the Department of Health
and the Wolfson Foundation to establish research centres in England and
Scotland.
One will be based at Manchester Royal Infirmary; part of its role will be to
develop a virtual reality simulator to help train surgeons in laparoscopic
techniques. The centre is part of a broader, nationwide initiative by the
foundation and the department.
'We plan to collaborate closely with industry because there have been a
number of developments in this field. Eventually, we hope to come up with
our own practical simulator into which we can put several three-dimensional
operations,' explains Rory McCloy, a consultant surgeon at Manchester Royal
Infirmary and clinical director of the project.
To gauge the suitability of technology in this field, the Manchester centre
has linked up with Advanced Robotics Research, a small company at Salford
University. Together they plan to develop a 3-D anatomical simulator which
will enable junior surgeons to practise minimally invasive surgery in a
virtual world.
Advanced Robotics, which also runs a number of virtual reality research
programmes in the engineering sector, will work with McCloy. During the
three-year project, Advanced Robotics plans to draw on both its own and
outside expertise, says Robert Stone, the company's technical manager and
virtual reality director for the simulator project.
Stone says part of his job will be to form an advisory group. The aim is to
bring together 'what have until recently been quite diverse and unfocused
technologies into a single centre to develop cost-effective virtual
trainers'.
He says the US is much more involved than the UK in virtual reality and
medicine. He has invited James Coleman, a surgeon and European medical
director for Davis &amp; Geck, the surgical division of Cyanamid, the US drugs
company, to join the advisory committee. Stone is also in touch with Marconi
Simulation, part of GEC, and the engineering department at Cambridge
University.
Coleman, based at Cyanamid's London research centre, is also a consultant to
Cine-Med, a US company which makes medical education films. Cine-Med has
developed an advanced prototype simulator called Virtual Clinic. It
comprises a graphics workstation which houses a 'reality engine', software
and a simulator comprising six-dimensional tracking devices, surgical
instruments and a patient shell.
On a screen, surgeons can see virtual organs reacting to stimuli as they
would in the real world. If an organ is cut, virtual blood flows from the
wound and if dissected it becomes two separate objects. Cine-Med plans to
release the Virtual Clinic on to the world market next year, says Coleman,
and the company hopes to set up a European research centre, possibly in the
UK or Germany.
The joint research project between Manchester Royal Infirmary and Advanced
Robotics is not about simply adopting a system, says Stone, but using all
the resources it can to develop a virtual simulator which best suits the
needs of UK surgeons. Coleman agrees that co-ordinated research will benefit
the industry as a whole.
Advanced Robotics, for example, plans to develop special gloves which give
the surgeon the feeling of touch and 'force feedback'.
'When you wear one of these gloves and hold, move or cut a virtual organ,
the surgeon will be able to feel it,' says McCloy. Stone describes the glove
as an 'exoskeleton (skin) in reverse'. It applies force with a series of
pressure pads to the hand inside it, and by linking the exoskeleton's motors
to the virtual graphics a surgeon can 'feel' forces as virtual tissue is
pulled.
Another of the team's goals is to send virtual imagery down telephone lines,
a move which one day may enable junior surgeons at different hospitals to
practise operations on simulators linked to desktop computers.
'Virtual reality has been dismissed as arcade game surgery by some surgeons,
but its importance is limited only by our imagination,' says McCloy. 'It's
no substitute for operating on real people - but l think it could fill a
very important gap between operating on sugar cubes and doing the real
thing.'

stamping-ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, is to
succeed Sir Ron Dearing as chairman of the Northern Development Company, the
economic regeneration body for north east England and Cumbria.
Both men have strong connections with the area; while in his thirties, Sir
Ron became the regional director for a group of government departments
charged with fostering industrial and commercial development.
Sir George (right), 58, non-executive chairman of both Marley and venture
capital group 3i, was born in Gateshead and educated at Durham University;
he retains a holiday home on Holy Island, off the Northumberland coast.
Sir Ron, 63, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority and
of the Camelot national lottery bid, steps down on March 31 from the
chairmanship of the NDC after serving four years.
In Sir George, the NDC, a partnership formed in the mid-1980s by the private
sector, local authorities and trades unions, has again found a high-profile
public figure with a strong commitment to the region, coupled with
disinterest in the Pounds 14,000 a year salary the NDC chairmanship carries.
Sir Ron took only part of that sum and Sir George has indicated he will not
be collecting any of it for himself.

Nick de Jongh is quitting as director of external affairs at the Engineering
Employers Federation to become director of public affairs at GKN, one of the
federation's biggest members.
De Jongh's move at the end of April ends 19 years at the federation, whose
role has changed, particularly in recent years. In his opinion, some new
faces are needed among the senior officials. At GKN, he will replace John
Southgate, who next month becomes Ford of Europe's vice-president for public
and government affairs.
The federation is already looking for a new director- general following Neil
Johnson's departure in November and the recent cancellation of plans to
merge its central functions with those of the Confederation of British
Industry.
Meanwhile John Rugman, GKN's head of human resources services, has been
elected president of EEF West Midlands, the largest of the associations
affiliated to the federation.

In a move designed to reduce environmental noise while disposing of used car
tyres, the Paris-based company ACIAL has developed an acoustic barrier
comprising a metal casing with half-tyres stacked inside.
The side of the casing facing the noise is made from perforated sheet metal
to focus the noise towards the shells formed by the halved tyres. There it
is damped and absorbed. For frequencies between 250 and 2000 Hz - the
frequency of heavy traffic noise - up to 85 per cent of the noise is
absorbed.

<TEXT>
The US electronics company Hewlett-Packard has developed what it claims is
the world's brightest light-emitting diode.
Clusters of the chips, which are up to four times brighter than existing
devices, could replace ordinary incandescent light bulbs where long life and
reliability are required, such as in traffic lights.
The breakthrough has been achieved through the development of a transparent
gallium phosphide substrate which enables significantly more light to emit
from the diode than did the traditional substrate, light-absorbing gallium
arsenide.
The new LEDs should be available within the next six months.

rotavirus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the world's biggest killers of young children, rotavirus
gastroenteritis, could itself be under threat, with the help of the common
dairy cow.
Scientists in Adelaide, South Australia, have devised a milk-based product
which gives children immunity from the rotavirus by preventing it from
invading the lining cells of the gut, the cause of diarrhoea.
The potion, called Gastrogard, is made by injecting cows with a special
vaccine prior to calving. When the cow then produces, colostrum, the
super-rich milk made after birth, it contains antibodies against the
rotavirus. When administered to children, the antibodies bind to the
rotavirus.
Although presenting most danger to children in third world countries, the
rotavirus is also a problem in children's hospitals and care centres.
Production of the Gastrogard powder will begin next year at the South
Australian Research and Development Institute.

<TEXT>
Eating a papaya fruit can be a powerful method of contraception in women.
Scientific researchers at the University of Sussex, in Brighton, have shown
that papain, an enzyme found in papaya, attacks progesterone, a critical
hormone for conception and pregnancy. When the papain interacts with a
particular protein in the blood it becomes up to 24 times as powerful as
when in its natural state.
The findings, which could lead to new methods of contraception, will not be
news to women in India and Sri Lanka, who have been eating papaya for
generations to prevent conception.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology: China exports Torch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since China launched its Torch Programme in 1988, the cream of the country's
8m scientists and technicians has been mobilised in a big effort to exploit
high technology.
So far, the 100,000 specialists chosen by the State Science and Technology
Commission have
developed more than 1,500 industrial applications in new materials,
biotechnology, electronics, information technology, energy saving and
environmental protection.
China is eager to reap more benefits from this effort by exporting new
technology and finding foreign partners. Beijing is also keen to incorporate
applications researched abroad into its own programme.
Thus China recently established a joint venture (to be known as Torch
Overseas or Torch Worldwide) with Micro Electronics International Europa, a
supplier of Chinese-made telecommunications equipment based in Portugal.
The new company will explore the market for Chinese technology, introduce
advanced technology into China, supply equipment for high-tech production in
China, foster joint ventures and promote foreign investment in Chinese
projects.
'The Torch Programme is designed to take Chinese industry out of the 19th
century into the 21st,' says Roman von Rupp, the Lisbon-based president of
MEI Europa. 'The opportunities the programme offers to foreign companies are
vast but most of the international business community has not yet become
aware of it.'
MEI manufactures telecommunications and other equipment in China, sometimes
using Japanese technology. It has offices in Japan where it researches
electronics projects.
A Torch delegation visited universities and research centres in Lisbon last
November. Chinese authorities are examining the market potential of two
applications developed in Portugal - one uses halogen lamps to grow low-cost
thin ribbons of crystalline silicon, the other is a computer program for
public transport planning.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Management: Are you a workaholic?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British have never admired work for its own sake. They have tended to
side with Oscar Wilde who noted that work is the refuge of people who have
nothing better to do.
Americans have been known to consider 'workaholism' a virtue, a form of
patriotism, the way to win friends and influence people.
But the workaholic has self-doubts. He or she may be seen as a pathetic soul
unable to experience pleasure.
Workaholics shun vacations; because their jobs are their passion they do not
feel they need to get away from it all. The anxiety that precedes taking any
holiday break seems more trouble than it is worth. Finally, workaholics are
afraid that they would lose complete control of their jobs if they left
their desks, albeit briefly.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Management: Testimony to the German system - John Craven
gives his view of the role played by the banks during the recent crisis at
Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CRAVEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many newspaper articles about the recent problems at Metallgesellschaft, the
Frankfurt-based metal, mining and industrial group, have criticised the role
played by the German banks, and particularly by Deutsche Bank.
As the only foreigner on the board of managing directors of Deutsche Bank, I
may be in a unique position to put these criticisms in perspective. I have
not been involved personally in the resolution of the situation but have
witnessed at first hand what has been achieved.
Much of the criticism has focused on a perceived conflict of interest
between certain German banks as shareholders of Metallgesellschaft, and
their position as principal creditors, and on the role played by Ronaldo
Schmitz, who is both a colleague of mine on the board of managing directors
of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the supervisory board of
Metallgesellschaft.
The suggestions have been that there is too close a relationship between the
leading German banks, companies in which they may have shareholdings, and
their supervisory boards; and that the banks have been motivated by their
interests as shareholders to force the creditor banks to accept a resolution
of the problem which favoured the interests of the banks as shareholders
over those of the creditor banks which had no shareholdings.
In my opinion, the prompt and efficient way in which the German institutions
acted to resolve a crisis that might, in other circumstances, have resulted
in a massive bankruptcy, is a testimony to the German system. This is not to
be critical of the way such matters are handled in other financial centres
and jurisdictions.
Within a few weeks of the scale of the problems facing Metallgesell-schaft
eventually becoming known to the supervisory board, the German banks
provided the company with emergency liquidity in excess of DM1.5bn (Pounds
580m) to enable it to meet its pressing obligations; the management of the
company was almost completely replaced (six out of eight members of the
board of managing directors are new appointees - some from external sources,
some internal); the creditor banks agreed to a massive equity-for-debt
exchange; and, subject to the approval of two general meetings of
shareholders to be held on February 24 and March 30 1994, the shareholders
will have agreed to a DM2.7bn recapitalisation.
The future of a leading international company employing 58,000 people across
several countries will have been put on a sound footing under new management
that can concentrate on the reorganisation of the business without the
pressures of an unsound financial structure.
I would submit that this is an extraordinary feat which would have been
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in the timescale involved under
other systems, and one which is deserving of praise rather than criticism.
It is also noteworthy that the problems were resolved entirely in the
private sector and without the intervention of the banking supervision or
other authorities in Germany, or elsewhere. Admittedly, the speed with which
a solution was implemented was dictated by the German bankruptcy law: this
lays down a very tight timetable effectively forcing the supervisory board
to declare bankruptcy within 21 days of it becoming clear that a deficiency
of net assets exists, unless this deficiency is remedied within this time
limit.
In reality I think the fact that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank were both
shareholders and creditors of Metallgesellschaft - and the fact that some 65
per cent of the equity was held by just five institutions (including the two
banks) who collaborated in the resolution - worked to the advantage of all
the shareholders in the company. There was a community of economic interest
between shareholders and creditors in preserving Metallgesell-schaft as a
going concern. The result might have been quite different if shareholders
and creditors had been competing to protect their own interests.
I was interested to read a recent speech by Pen Kent, an executive director
of the Bank of England, to the Association of Corporate Treasurers, which
said that 'a weakness of refinancing a company involving just its banks is
that they are generally protecting their own positions at the expense of
other creditors and shareholders'. He continued: 'It would be more
satisfactory if the opportunity to participate in a workout were available
to all creditors and shareholders - however, this would seem to be an
unobtainable objective . . . '
There is, I think, a perception that the banks in Germany have a
disproportionate influence over the affairs of German companies and exercise
this through the many memberships of corporate supervisory boards that are
occupied by members of the boards of managing directors of the major banks.
This is a wrong perception. Where bank directors have seats on the
supervisory boards of industrial companies they are not there to protect the
interests of the bank. German corporate law states that the responsibility
of the members of the board of managing directors (the Vorstand) and that of
the supervisory board (the Aufsichtsrat) is to look after the interests of
all the stakeholders in the business. This extends not only to the
shareholders and the creditor banks, but also to the interests of the
company as a going concern and to the interests of the suppliers, the
customers, the workforce, the management and the communities in which the
company operates.
In the Metallgesellschaft case all these stakeholders have been protected by
the steps that have been taken. Surprising though it may seem to outsiders,
members of supervisory boards who happen to be working directors of the
banks do not divulge to their bank colleagues confidential information about
the companies on whose supervisory boards they sit. They take very seriously
their obligations to act in the interests of all the stakeholders in the
company.
The influence of the German banks - and in particular Deutsche Bank - is
also, in my view, blown out of all proportion by the international press. It
is true that Deutsche Bank has a number of significant industrial
participations - the details are a matter of public knowledge. In Germany
the number of quoted public companies is, in relation to the size of the
economy, far smaller than, for example, in the UK. In Germany there is not
the requirement for companies to establish segregated pension funds - a
large investment force in the UK - and insurance companies are restricted in
the extent to which they can hold equity investments. The result is that a
very large share of holdings in German industrial companies is held by other
industrial companies, in particular companies which have origins in the
utility industries. The banks are much smaller shareholders, as a group,
than is the foreign perception. Their influence as shareholders is
commensurately less than is perceived outside Germany.
As for the suggestion that the members of the supervisory board of
Metallgesellschaft failed to exercise their supervisory responsibilities
effectively, I would only comment that the efficiency of a supervisory board
is not dissimilar to that of the non-executive directors of a public company
in the UK. The effectiveness of the non-executive is a direct function of
the quality and flow of information from executive management. I pass no
judgment on the discharge by management of its responsibilities in the
Metallgesellschaft case since I am not aware of all the facts.
If information is withheld in response to direct questions, no Cadbury or
other systems of corporate governance will enhance the ability of the
non-executive or supervisory board member to fulfil his responsibilities
adequately. However, I would not be surprised to see a trend in Germany
towards the establishment of audit committees made up of supervisory board
members to provide a forum for the transmission of information direct from
external auditors to the supervisory board.

Deutsche Bank.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Property: Minnow in a big pond - Vanessa Houlder on the
strategy that has made Burford one of the sector's fastest-growing groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement last week of a Pounds 103m acquisition by Burford has
catapulted the UK group into the ranks of the country's top 10 companies in
the property sector.
The deal prompted Kleinwort Benson, merchant bank, to describe Burford as an
'outstanding company. The remarkable aspect of Burford is that the
management has proved itself to be expert both in bull and bear markets.'
The reason why Burford attracts such praise is a combination of conservative
financial management, an ability to extract strong returns from difficult
properties and a record of well-timed deals. But, above all, Burford's
judgement of the market gyrations in recent years has made it one of the few
property companies to survive the recession with its reputation enhanced.
Burford demonstrated a flair for timing by selling property totalling Pounds
92m in 1989-91, enabling it to make substantial investments at the bottom of
the market. The company turned buyer in 1990-91; since then it has invested
Pounds 250m in property. Last week's acquisition of 15 properties from hotel
group Ladbroke, financed by a Pounds 100m rights issues, will push up
Burford's market capitalisation to about Pounds 350m.
Burford likes to project itself as a conservative company with strong
financial controls. 'Our gearing (ratio of borrowing to equity) and
cash-flow considerations come before anything else,' said Mr Nick Leslau,
chief executive.
He attributes much of the company's success to the presence of Mr Nigel Wray
as executive chairman. Mr Wray, a financier, holds directorships with media
group Carlton Communications, Singer &amp; Friedlander, a merchant bank, and was
recently appointed chairman of Carlisle, a property services group. He
joined Burford in 1988 after his Chartsearch publishing company achieved a
reverse takeover of Burford.
Mr Leslau argues that his property expertise and Mr Wray's financial skills
give Burford an edge over most competitors, which tend to be dominated by a
single entrepreneur.
The emphasis on tight controls at Burford is reflected in rigorous financial
and management accounting, an emphasis on analysing the cash-flow of
properties, a strict gearing limit of 100 per cent and a strong focus on
government or blue-chip tenants, which account for 77 per cent of cash-flow.
Burford also adheres to what it calls the 'Armageddon rule' - ie that if
every tenant were to quit at the earliest opportunity the company would
still be able to service its interest for another 15 years, assuming no
tenant defaults.
Burford's ideal portfolio is an equal split between high-quality,
institutional-grade property, high-yielding properties let to secure tenants
and 'difficult' management-intensive properties that are capable of
generating high returns.
An example of the latter is Heywood Business park, a warehouse distribution
estate near Manchester which Burford bought from Control Securities last
Christmas. The estate required an overhaul and a large percentage of its
properties were unlet. 'With these sort of deals, it is more like buying a
business than a property investment,' said Mr Leslau. 'There is a
tremendously exciting upside.'
Following the Ladbroke deal, Burford will have a higher weighting than usual
 -by its standards - of top-quality property. Institutional-grade property
comprises 80 per cent of the Ladbroke portfolio, increasing the percentage
of this type of property in Burford's portfolio to 57 per cent.
Burford intends to rebalance its portfolio by borrowing against the Ladbroke
acquisition. If Burford gears up to 100 per cent it will command Pounds 150m
of buying power. It will also raise more cash by selling Pounds 35m-worth of
small buildings from a portfolio currently valued at about Pounds 2.5m.
Burford believes that it has reached a size where returns do not justify the
expenditure of management time on small properties. 'We have outgrown that
type of property,' he said.
Instead, it will concentrate on buying relatively big properties valued at
Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m. Burford believes there is a gap in the market for
buyers of this type of property. 'They are too messy for institutions but
too big for the vast majority of property companies,' he said.
As well as concentrating on larger properties, Burford also intends to
switch the focus of its portfolio. Over the past year, it has been buying
institutional-type property in the belief that such a move would be the
first step towards reaping the benefits of a general upturn in the economy.
Increasingly, however, the best returns are likely to come from secondary
property, Mr Leslau said. These properties will be the main beneficiaries of
rising rents and increasing levels of bank lending, he added. 'Over the next
three years, the more secondary property will out-perform dramatically.'
Arguably, the sector of the market that will out-perform all others in the
upswing of the property cycle is development activity. Burford, however,
insists that it will play no part in this. 'We will never speculatively
develop,' Mr Leslau said. First, the company lacks the skills necessary for
this type of activity; second, the high risks associated with speculative
ventures are at odds with Burford's conservative philosophy. 'The psychology
of developers and investors are poles apart,' said Mr Leslau.
It remains to be seen whether Burford will continue to stand out in an
increasingly competitive market. 'The question is whether it can continue to
perform from a much larger and at present lowly-geared base, both in terms
of gross and net assets,' said Kleinwort Benson.
Mr Leslau is confident that Burford will continue to win good deals. His
confidence is inspired by the skills of his agent, a good knowledge of
potential deals and a concentration on a relatively unfashionable size and
type of property.
He is cool on the notion that Burford could eventually grow into one of the
sector's largest companies. Size is meaningless, he said. What matters is
earnings per share.
But Mr Leslau insists that Burford's increased size after the Ladbroke deal
will not be a hindrance to growth. Burford is still a relative minnow, he
said. 'The day we feel that we cannot out-perform, we will sell the
company,' he said.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Property: Increasing gulf in London commercial market, says
survey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery of the London market will be marked by a widening gulf between
the performance of top-quality sites and secondary properties, according to
a forecast by Savills, commercial property agents.
Over the next three years, Savills predicts a 15 per cent annual increase in
rates for top-grade space in the City to an average Pounds 46 per square
foot, and a 12 per cent annual rise in the West End to an average Pounds 51
per sq ft.
After 1997, City rents are likely to dip in the face of competition from
London docklands, where improved transport links are likely to enhance the
area's appeal.
Savills' calculations assume a stable economic background. It also assumes
that most take-up will result from tenants leaving old offices for new ones,
rather than from expansion.
The lack of net take-up of space means that overall vacancy levels of about
10 per cent look set to become a permanent feature of the market. 'The
London market is becoming increasingly polarised. There is an oversupply of
obsolescent secondary space, much of which may not be re-occupied unless
redeveloped or converted to alternative use,' Savills said.
The agent argues that tenants prefer modern buildings with floor space of at
least 5,000 sq ft because such buildings can accommodate computer cabling
and therefore improve internal communications.
Such grade 'A' space accounts for 43 per cent of the City market, 90 per
cent of the docklands market and just 13 per cent of the West End market.
Grade 'A' space accounts for only 6.5 per cent of total stock and is likely
to fall to 2 per cent within three years.
After 1997, the development market is likely to pick up. Improved
infrastructure, such as the Jubilee Line extension to docklands and the
Paddington/Heathrow rail link, is likely to make docklands and Paddington
popular destinations for tenants.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Art-nouveau cabinet sells for a record Pounds 793,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A writing cabinet designed in 1904 in art-nouveau style by Glasgow architect
Charles Rennie Mackintosh, sold for Pounds 793,500 at Christie's yesterday.
It was much above its top estimate of Pounds 300,000, and set a record for
Mackintosh and for any item of 20th-century furniture.
The desk was the highlight of a collection of designs and furniture by
Mackintosh assembled during the past 50 years by the architect Dr Thomas
Howarth.
The 143 lots totalled Pounds 2.27m as against a pre-sale estimate of about
Pounds 1m. A high-back oak chair, probably designed about 1899 for
Mackintosh's own use, sold for Pounds 309,500 (estimate Pounds 30,000-Pounds
40,000), and a large watercolour, 'The wassail', made Pounds 80,700.
Two other collections were offered yesterday. Christie's South Kensington
sold the archive of original art work for the comic postcards produced by
Bamforth, the printers, for Pounds 88,000. The pre-sale estimate was Pounds
20,000 plus.
Sotheby's raised Pounds 300,000 (estimate Pounds 200,000) from almost 1,500
items assembled as a modern 'cabinet of curiosities' by Lord McAlpine, the
former Conservative party treasurer.
The top price among the postcards was Pounds 3,850 (estimate Pounds
150-Pounds 250) paid for a lot of 11 items, including the art work for a
card known as 'Hey Sonia]', showing a skater performing on the ice minus her
underwear. It was Bamforth's most successful card.
Among Lord McAlpine's curiosities, a late 18th-century painting of a Fijian
sold for Pounds 4,600. More bizarre was the Pounds 2,530 given for a panther
skeleton (estimate Pounds 300-Pounds 400). A group of seven pilgrim badges,
bought as souvenirs in the Middle Ages by visitors to the shrine of a saint,
also made Pounds 2,530.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Tory chiefs face fresh EU poll row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pro-European wing of the Conservative party has voiced fresh concern
about the government's campaign for the European elections amid signs that
the forthcoming poll is already reviving the party's divisions over the
Maastricht treaty.
Senior figures in the Positive Europe group, which represents about 90
backbench MPs, plan to protest to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
that the Euro-sceptic right of the party is making the running in the
campaign.
The pro-Europeans fear that the tone of recent statements by Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, suggest
that the Conservatives might retreat into 'Brussels-bashing' in the approach
to the June elections.
They want Mr Hurd to make it clear to those running the campaign that the
government draws a clear distinction between the institutions of the
European Union and who controls them.
The Tory right has made the growing powers of the institutions - including
the parliament and the commission - the focus of their attacks.
But the Positive Europe group believes that such a strategy would simply
deter Conservatives supporters from voting in the election.
Instead it wants the campaign to emphasise the need for the Conservatives
not to allow the institutions to remain under socialist control.
That approach is backed by Mr Hurd. Pro-European Tory MPs believe, however,
that it is being undercut both by rightwing cabinet ministers and by the
tactics favoured in Conservative Central Office.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Major steers clear of pitfalls in Moscow: How Number 10's
new press secretary managed overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was an air of quiet celebration in 10 Downing Street yesterday. Mr
John Major's three-day visit to Moscow may not have been the most exciting
of events. But nor had it been, like most previous trips, a disaster.
The Westminster journalists who have dogged and disrupted the prime minister
on earlier ventures abroad came home late on Wednesday night more or less
empty-handed.
There were occasional mishaps for Mr Major in Moscow. The tabloids mocked
his appearance in a Russian fur hat. The television cameras caught him
looking awkwardly unsure of himself during an official dinner with Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president.
But this was nothing compared with the string of disasters that accompanied
his Far East tour last autumn. The agenda then had been set entirely by the
press and Mr Major had been bombarded about the divisions and unrest in the
Conservative party. He was provoked into a series of intemperate attacks on
his critics and the resultant headlines were universally bad.
In Moscow it was different, although the government is still beset by
domestic trouble. Just before his departure another junior member of the
government was obliged to resign because of personal conduct. The
back-to-basics initiative has been reduced to a shambles.
But on this occasion Mr Major decided to set his own terms for contacts with
the travelling press - which dominate news coverage of such visits. He
decided from the outset that he would not be harried by the inevitable
questions about domestic difficulties.
In interviews and press conferences during the trip he politely rebuffed
questions on back to basics or the sexual proclivities of members of his
government.
There were no angry outbursts, no ill-judged answers. Instead Mr Major
insisted on talking about the issues behind his Moscow talks - the situation
in Bosnia, Anglo-Russian relations and the stalling pace of economic reform
in Russia.
Much of the credit for the careful news management was given to Mr
Christopher Meyer, the prime minister's newly appointed press secretary.
On his first foreign trip Mr Meyer was determined to maintain control of the
press. So he mixed blunt warnings that the prime minister would not respond
to questions about back to basics with a carefully timed flow of 'news
nuggets' to keep the media - and especially the tabloid newspapers -
occupied.
By and large it worked.
Mr Major's own attitude may have been the critical factor. After enduring
the worst press of any prime minister since Mr Harold Wilson in 1968, Mr
Major appeared ready to take the advice of his ministerial colleagues and
officials to inject distance and formality into his links with journalists.
Hence there were none of the off-the-cuff conversations which have
previously got him into so much trouble. His appearances were carefully
controlled and always tape-recorded by aides.
Having succeeded in Moscow, Mr Major, with the help of Mr Meyer, is
promising more of the same when he meets President Bill Clinton for a
potentially difficult meeting in Washington in 10 days.
The prime minister knows he cannot afford to provide the excuse that critics
are looking for to pronounce the death of the special relationship.
Some are already suggesting his relations with Mr Clinton are as brusque as
those between Mr Neil Kinnock, then Labour leader, and former president
Ronald Reagan during the 1980s.
On the evidence of Moscow, Mr Major should succeed. He certainly needs to.
The domestic pressures on his premiership over the next few months will be
bad enough even without any more accidents abroad.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Asian workers win race-bias award
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventeen Asian workers disciplined for taking a day off to celebrate a
religious festival were yesterday awarded Pounds 1,000 compensation each for
racial discrimination.
An industrial tribunal hearing in Leeds was regarded as a test case for the
Asian community in Britain.
The men had received final written warnings when they took the day off for
Eid - one of the most important dates in the Muslim calendar - in June 1992.
Mr Keith Sugars, managing director of JH Walker of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire,
had described their action as 'mutiny'. He had banned staff from taking
holidays during the busiest period of the year in May, June and July.
But the Asian workers did not believe the rule applied to Eid because they
had previously been given the day off for the festival.
The tribunal decided in November that the men had been racially
discriminated against. At the hearing yesterday to decide on compensation Mr
Fraser Younson, solicitor for the company, urged the panel to award
compensation of between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100.
Mr Zafar Iqbal, representing 16 of the men, said a low award might
trivialise the matter. The company intends to appeal against the awards to
the Employment Appeals Tribunal.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for a 'research masters' degree to be taken by all students aiming for
science doctorates were announced yesterday Mr William Waldegrave, the
science minister.
The qualification, which the government hopes will be offered from September
1995, is intended to cut the amount of research council funding for students
who fail to complete their doctorates. Of those who started science
doctorates using government research council grants in 1988, 40 per cent had
not completed their doctorates four years later.
Employers had also expressed concern that their recruits who had taken
doctorates had inadequate communication skills and were too 'narrowly
focused', with a poor grasp of management, according to officials.
Mr Waldegrave suggested that the new qualification, provisionally known as
the MRes, should take one year to achieve and include a significant research
component, accounting for 60 per cent of students' time.
It would include a grounding in research techniques and modules designed to
provide 'transferable skills' - including management, team working, and
communication - to enable scientists to explain their work to lay audiences.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Treasury reveals cost of tax rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday disclosed that tax rises from April 1995 will cost
a family on average earnings more than Pounds 1,000 per year.
If reductions in mortgage tax relief are added to the official figures
Labour said the total tax rise would be more than Pounds 1,250 a year - the
so-called 'tax bombshell' the Conservatives accused Labour of planning
during the last election campaign.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'In the interests of honesty and
standards the Tories should now put up billboards in every constituency
saying the Conservative government is responsible for the Pounds 1,000 plus
tax rise.'
Confirmation of the new tax increases were contained in a written answer
from Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, to Ms Harriet Harman,
Labour's Treasury spokesman.
Figures show that a married man on average earnings with two children will
have to pay Pounds 22.32 more in tax per week in April 1995 than he does
now. This amounts to Pounds 1,160 more per year in tax.
The Conservative party's credentials as the party of low taxation have
already been under attack following the recent publication of figures
showing that the government will from April take more in tax from the
average family than Labour did.
As a result of the 1993 Budgets the total tax paid by a married man on
average earnings will rise from Pounds 118.36 to Pounds 130.88 in April, to
Pounds 140.68 from April 1995.
The change in tax paid since 1979, when Labour was last in office, as a
percentage of earnings in direct and indirect taxes, is 35 per cent from
April, rising to 36.2 per cent in 1995/96. That compares with 32.2 per cent
in 1978-1979.
The Treasury yesterday argued that the figures were hypothetical since they
had not yet come into force and did not take account of future budgets.
It also argued that Labour had ignored the increase in living standards
since 1979 which outstripped tax increases.
Ms Harman said: 'There is nothing hypothetical about the government's
figures since they relate to what has already been put into law. Having
failed on tax they cannot claim competence in economic management.'
The tax increases come in various forms and at different times over the next
few years.
From April personal allowances are frozen, the married couple allowance is
cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, national insurance goes up and VAT is
levied on domestic fuel at 8 per cent.
The new 3 per cent insurance premium tax comes into force from October and
air passenger tax from November.
From April 1995 the full 17.5 per cent is levied on domestic fuel and the
married couple allowance is cut by another five per cent to 15 per cent.
The government figures showing the increases in tax do not include cuts in
mortgage tax relief from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in April, followed by
another five per cent cut to 15 per cent the following year.
In a parliamentary answer to Ms Harman two weeks ago the Treasury said cuts
in mortgage tax relief would cost a typical family with a Pounds 30,000
mortgage, Pounds 4.40 a week from April 1995.
Earlier in the day Mr John Smith, Labour leader, renewed his assault on the
prime minister's 'back to basics' policy, accusing the government of failing
to tell the truth on tax.
But Mr John Major insisted at Commons question time that the Conservatives
were 'the party that cuts taxes'. Joe Rogaly, Page 16

FT  18 FEB 94 / Ministers back Tec-chamber mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pilot scheme of voluntary mergers between chambers of commerce and
Training and Enterprise Councils won government approval yesterday. The
scheme's aim is to stimulate local business activities.
The announcement was made by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, in a letter to the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Tec National Council.
The organisations welcomed the government's decision and pointed out that
some chambers and Tecs had already been working more closely. The proposed
bodies would offer benefits to local business by reducing duplication of
activities.
The British Chambers of Commerce says it represents more than 200,000
companies, which amounts to 40 per cent of all businesses. There are 82 Tecs
operating in England and Wales.
The BCC and the Tec National Council emphasised yesterday there would be no
pressure applied to secure mergers. No more than 10 mergers are likely this
year.
Both organisations insisted yesterday that where mergers took place it was
'absolutely critical' that the new bodies met local business needs, and that
merging would 'in due course enable them to equal or better their French or
German equivalents'.
Ministers are keen to ensure that any merged Tecs and chambers should be
created under an agreed framework of guidance which is approved by them.
They also want the new bodies to play a strategic role and exercise an
overview of all training and enterprise issues in their areas, including the
creation and popularising of business links. The government insists that the
merged bodies should represent the full range of local employers and not
just those who belong to them.
The proposed articles of association for such bodies have to make clear they
will not become involved in direct delivery of services except with the
explicit permission of government departments responsible for funding the
relevant service.
Separate organisations will have to be set up where one of the parties to a
merger already acts as a large-scale deliverer of training programmes. Mr
Heseltine and Mr Hunt said in their letter: 'We will need to ensure we have
legal advice on any contractual implications.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / Split hearings on airport projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has refused to combine planning inquiries into the expansion
of Manchester and Liverpool airports - making it more difficult for
Manchester's proposed second runway to be scrapped in favour of developing
Liverpool's airport at Speke.
It means Manchester's ambition to cater for 30m passengers a year by early
next century will be considered alone at a planning inquiry later this year.
The second runway - broadly supported by most of northern England's
political and business leaders - is opposed by residents and local
politicians, as well as environmental groups.
The airport was used by 13.4m passengers last year, when it opened a Pounds
265m second terminal. Annual growth is running at about 12 per cent - and at
18 per cent for passengers using international scheduled flights. A second
runway would take it past its present capacity of 17m passengers a year.
Liverpool airport is used by fewer than 500,000 passengers a year. Supported
by Merseyside councils and business, it has tabled expansion plans which
depend on capping Manchester's growth and forcing airlines to use Liverpool.
With about 1,000 jobs created in and around airports for every 1m extra
passengers, Liverpool's backers argue that the worsening economic imbalance
between Merseyside and Greater Manchester might be reduced if the 'north's
second runway' were at Speke.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Acquittal ruling fails to ease wariness in City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment analysts are thought unlikely to become any less wary of
infringing the laws on insider dealing than they have been since last year's
conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie, a Scottish investment analyst, in spite of
the quashing on Wednesday of the conviction.
The Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh also cancelled Mr Mackie's Pounds
25,000 fine. Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General of Scotland, said the trial
judge had misdirected the jury.
The conviction of Mr Mackie sent a shudder through the UK financial
community, which changed its way of doing business.
Mr Hamish Buchan, a leading analyst, with NatWest Markets said: 'An analyst
might now begin a session with a company chairman by saying: 'Please don't
make me an insider'. I believe they will remain guarded despite Thorold's
acquittal.'
Many analysts now like to have a colleague with them when they talk to a
company to corroborate an account of the meeting if there were a subsequent
dispute.
Mr Mackie was convicted under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing)
Act of 'counselling and procuring' two salesmen at Bell Lawrie White, the
Edinburgh stockbrokers for which he worked, to deal in shares of Shanks &amp;
McEwan, the waste disposal company, on behalf of clients.
Mr Peter Runciman, chairman of Shanks &amp; McEwan, had testified that he had
informed Mr Mackie that the company was soon to issue a profits warning.
Mr Mackie said that Mr Runciman had only said that there would be 'little by
way of growth in earnings per share' for the company in the current half
year.
By selling ahead of the profits warning that was later issued the shares
realised Pounds 1.4m more than they would have done after the warning was
issued.
Lord Hope, backed by Lords Cowie and Mayfield, said this week that the trial
judge, temporary judge Sheriff Robin McEwan QC, was wrong to say that Mr
Runciman's evidence was corroborated by the fact that Bell Lawrie White sold
so many shares just after the meeting.
He said the circumstantial evidence was also entirely consistent with Mr
Mackie's innocent version of events. 'In my opinion there was a miscarriage
of justice because there was insufficient evidence in law for a conviction.'

Amateur sports clubs will be able to reclaim value added tax paid on
subscription income, equipment hire to members and fund-raising, Customs and
Excise said yesterday.
Any VAT paid on these items since January 1 1990 can be reclaimed from April
1 this year, in a move that Customs estimates could trigger reimbursements
worth about Pounds 40m.
The announcement follows a reinterpretation of European Union law by
Customs. It will not affect VAT charged on transport, accommodation,
catering or fees and hire for visitors to clubs.
Customs also said yesterday that it would remove VAT from 'vanity units' in
bathroom and cloakroom sinks.

He said he was returning to journalism and other projects.
The move will coincide with the departure of Lord Palumbo as chairman of the

FT  18 FEB 94 / AEA sell-off move sparks union anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A union yesterday condemned a decision to privatise the Atomic Energy
Authority after Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, had confirmed the planned
sell-off.
The Institute of Professional Managers and Specialists, which represents
2,900 of the authority's workers, said the sale would result in further job
losses and add to the cost of decommissioning nuclear installations.
Moreover, Pounds 300m would have to be set aside to cover redundancy costs
and pensions for staff transferring to the privatised body.
The IPMS said the sale made no economic sense other than as a dry run for
the sale of Nuclear Electric, owner of most of the country's nuclear power
stations.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, AEA chairman, said the union appeared to have
understood little of what the authority was trying to do.
He said: 'Our option is, we believe, the best way of preserving the skills
that we have built up over the years with the best possible future for the
maximum number of people.'
Sir Anthony added that the proposed sale was 'a unique opportunity to
establish for Britain a flagship science and engineering services bureau'.
Mr Eggar said the method of privatisation would be decided later. Factors
that would be taken into account would include its marketplace performance
and the extent to which various sale options would meet customer
requirements, enhance competition, improve UK competitiveness and maximise
the return to taxpayers.
Mr Eggar also confirmed that the government would retain those parts of the
authority that have nuclear liabilities - principally ex-perimental reactors
that will have to be decomm-issioned.
The authority, which has led the development of the UK's nuclear power
industry for the past 40 years, is due in April to be split into a
government division to manage the liabilities, and a commercial division
that will be sold.
The commercial division, to be known as AEA Technology, will consist mainly
of the expertise built up by the authority, not just in the nuclear field
but in other areas of industry as well.
The commercial division is expected to have an annual turnover of about
Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m. Staff figures will stand at about 4,000 and its
sale value would be about Pounds 250m, City specialists believe.

The London Underground suffered 1,500 station closures and more than 2,000
serious delays last year according to government figures collated by Labour
yesterday.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said answers to a series of
parliamentary questions also showed that an average of 10 per cent of
escalators were out of action during the year.
Replies from the transport department revealed that 14,000 crimes including
1,000 robberies or crimes of violence occurred on the Underground.
The Underground suffered 500 fire and smoke incidents, including 150 which
resulted in fire brigade assistance. The east/west District Line called out
the fire brigade 33 times.
Mr Dobson said the Underground's problems were a result of under-investment
by the government, which planned to spend Pounds 1bn less than the Pounds
3.5bn over three years promised in their 1992 election manifesto.
'Tory ministers will not pay the price for that broken promise. They don't
use the Underground. The real price will be paid by millions of people who
rely on the Underground to get them around London,' Mr Dobson said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market research by the Local Government Commission for England in the next
13 counties for which it must make proposals for council reorganisation has
found a confused picture.
It reveals a strong preference for devolved government to small local areas
 -beyond the scope of the current review - but little enthusiasm for either
the present districts or counties.
Overall, most people identify most strongly with their immediate local
community. Only about half feel strong local identity with their district
councils - about the same proportion who identify strongly with their
counties.
A majority of residents in virtually all the counties surveyed favoured the
general principle of unitary authorities - that all services should be
provided by one council rather than being split between counties and
districts - although nowhere was there an overwhelming majority.
MORI, the research company, has completed its polling for the commission in
Bedfordshire, Cheshire, Devon, Dorset, Essex, Hereford &amp; Worcester, Kent,
Norfolk, Northumberland, Suffolk, Surrey, Warwickshire, and Wiltshire.
Submissions from councils in these areas are due within the next month, with
proposals from the commission following by the end of August.
Humberside County Council is applying for judicial review of the
commission's proposal that it should be abolished. Avon, Cleveland,
Derbyshire and Somerset have already challenged similar plans to replace
them with unitary authorities.

People who claimed to be aware of the planned reorganisation tended to be
less supportive of unitary authorities.
Several local authorities have conducted their own polls, asking residents
more precise questions in an attempt to find backing for local proposals.
One by Devon district councils found that 92.8 per cent wanted change in
some form. The most popular option, supported by 51 per cent of those who
replied to the districts' questionnaire, was for Plymouth to become a
separate unitary authority, with a two-tier structure remaining for the rest
of the county.

ECC International Europe is to shed 230 jobs at its china clay operations in
Cornwall and Devon, Roland Adburgham writes. Most of the job losses will be
at St Austell, Cornwall, where the unemployment rate is already 14.4 per
cent.
The company said 130 white-collar jobs and 100 manual jobs would be lost. It
was seeking voluntary severance but could not rule out compulsory
redundancies.
Redundancies - to take effect by May 20 - were caused by a combination of
factors. 'The markets we serve in the paper industry continue to be under
pressure with some over-capacity,' it said. Another reason was the company's
reorganisation last month into separate divisions for Europe and the US.

Companies in Avon are more confident about economic prospects, says a survey

Three out of five of the companies surveyed have launched new products or
services in the past three months or plan to do so this year, and 54 per
cent said they intended to expand into new markets.
But the survey, by the law firm Burges Salmon on behalf of Bristol Chamber
of Commerce and Initiative, found nearly a third of directors believed the
economy was still in recession or that it was too soon to tell whether it
was emerging from recession.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Low exports hit car production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car production fell 7.7 per cent in January to 100,711 from 109,127 in the
same month a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said
yesterday.
It said output was depressed by a sharp fall in production for export. Car
production rose by 6.5 per cent in the whole of last year to 1.38m, the
highest since 1974. Output has been lower than a year earlier in three of
the past four months.
Output for export markets has been hit by the weakness of new-car demand in
continental European markets, which has offset the rise in production for
the UK market.
Car production for export in January fell 27 per cent year-on-year to
36,724, while output for the domestic market rose 8.8 per cent to 63,987.
The overall level of production was also affected by the lower number of
working days in January than in the same month a year ago.
Vehicle output is still being affected by short-time working at several
plants. The Nissan car plant at Sunderland has been forced to abandon its
second shift for four months and will not resume night-shift working until
early March.
The steep fall in commercial vehicle output continued in January with a
year-on-year decline of 12.1 per cent to 16,531 from 18,813. This sector,
which suffered last year from the collapse of the former Daf group, fell
sharply in the whole of 1993 by 22.2 per cent to 193,414, the lowest level
since the 1940s.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Korean carmaker to set up design centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daewoo Motor, the South Korean vehicle maker, is setting up a design and
engineering centre in the UK as part of its expansion into world car
markets.
Daewoo Motor plans to establish itself as one of the top 10 carmakers in the
world and is seeking to more than triple its world production capacity. It
has taken over the facilities and staff of International Automotive Design
in Worthing, West Sussex.
IAD, formerly a leading UK automotive design and engineering company, was
taken over from the receiver last year by Mayflower, the specialist
automotive engineering group.
The move by Daewoo is a bold step by the smallest of the big three South
Korean carmakers to create a global design and engineering presence to
accelerate the development of its new-vehicle programme.
The South Korean motor industry is rapidly expanding overseas and both
Hyundai and Kia, Daewoo's bigger domestic rivals, have entered many European
car markets.
Hyundai cars were launched in the US in 1986 and Kia is entering the US
market this year.
The Daewoo Motor technical centre in the UK has a workforce of about 200 and
is recruiting additional engineering specialists, product planners and
designers.
The technical centre plans to start work this year on a project to design
and develop a range of medium-size family cars. It aims to take on a new
vehicle project each year.
UK car production was 7.7 per cent lower in January at 100,711 compared with
109,127 in the same month a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders said yesterday.
It said output was depressed by a sharp fall in production for export. Car
production rose by 6.5 per cent in the whole of last year to 1.38m, the
highest since 1974. Output has been lower than a year earlier in three of
the past four months.
Output for export markets has been hit by the weakness of new-car demand in
continental European markets, which has offset the rise in production for
the UK market.
Car production for export in January fell 27 per cent year-on-year to
36,724, while output for the domestic market rose 8.8 per cent to 63,987.
The overall level of production was also affected by the lower number of
working days in January. Vehicle output is still being affected by
short-time working at several plants.
The steep fall in commercial vehicle output continued in January with a
year-on-year decline of 12.1 per cent.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Builders face pressure after glass price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington, the glass group, is attempting to raise its European prices in a
move that could increase pressure on struggling UK construction companies
already operating on wafer-thin margins.
The group has put up its basic UK glass price by 6 per cent, while its
prices in continental Europe have increased by an average of 9 per cent.
Pilkington shares rose 5p to 201p on the news.
The company wants to recoup some of the price falls of recent years. Its
decision is in line with other building-material producers which have
increased prices in the past 12 months.
Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said glass prices had fallen by 30 per
cent during the past three years. He added: 'We are only trying to recover
lost ground.'
Although the group has cut costs, the price falls have hit its profits hard.
It is the second time in 12 months that the company has tried to raise
prices. In February last year it increased prices by 8 per cent only to see
the increment eroded as the year progressed.
Other UK building-material producers have been more successful in making
price rises stick. Producers of structural steel, plasterboard, concrete,
cement and some types of bricks have managed to increase prices as
manufacturing capacity in these industries has reduced or been rationalised
during the recession.
Construction companies that have won building contracts at little or no
profit margin could find themselves in serious trouble if the cost of
carrying out the work increases because of material price rises.
In the case of glass, continuing surplus capacity and falling demand in
continental Europe has made it more difficult to push through increases. In
Germany, in spite of good demand for building glass, prices have fallen by
10 per cent during the past year. Automotive glass volumes have been weak.
Mr Robb said capacity utilisation of about 85 per cent in Europe was still
too low to ensure price stability.
He said it was too early to say whether the price increase would hold.
However, the acquisition last year of the glass distribution business of
Heywood Williams, which gave Pilkington a 55 per cent share of the UK
market, should help in making the price rise stick, he said.
Earlier this month Pilkington's US subsidiary Libbey-Owens-Ford raised its
flat glass prices, for the third time in a year, by 5 per cent.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Labour police plans defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An opposition attempt to end the home secretary's responsibility for
policing in London was defeated in the Lords yesterday after the government
unexpectedly resurrected plans for an advisory committee.
Labour and Liberal Democrat peers argued during the committee stage of the
police and magistrates courts bill for the establishment of a police
authority in London similar to those which supervise the other 50 British
forces.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister of state, said the government would
proceed instead with proposals published in a white paper last year for a
committee of 12 Home Office appointees to advise the home secretary on
London policing.
A Labour amendment to establish an authority was defeated by 151 votes to
112. The government's main problems on the bill remain unresolved, however.
Backbench Tory peers have twice forced Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, to
retreat on plans to increase government control of police authorities.
Conservative peers have now tabled a number of further amendments on the
government's plans for performance targets for police forces and fixed-term
contracts for senior officers.
The government's proposals to reshape police authorities have been under
consistent attack since they were announced a year ago. Yet ministers
appeared genuinely unaware of the full strength or character of the
opposition until days before the bill started its parliamentary passage in
the Lords last month. Mr Howard has been on the defensive ever since.
His first concession, aimed at concern about proposals to appoint
independent members to police authorities, was to produce a procedure
distancing ministers from the initial selection process. In the face of
cross-party criticism in the Lords he then scrapped plans to let the home
secretary appoint heads of authorities, and agreed to greater flexibility in
authority size.
But ministers had again miscalculated. There were still enough Tory rebels
to maintain a risk of defeat when the bill returned to the Lords this week.
Opponents are now making further demands. They want local authority
councillors to retain a statutory majority on the new-style authorities,
with the independent members co-opted by the authorities themselves rather
than appointed by the home secretary.
The government insists its proposals would enhance local control but senior
police officers fear that, combined with provision in the bill for the home
secretary to set national policing objectives, they would increase
centralisation.
Mr Howard might decide to use the government's Commons majority to try to
implement his proposals. But this would not resolve what is in many ways the
biggest difficulty. This bill and the criminal justice bill are the
government's centrepieces of the parliamentary session, designed to
demonstrate that it is getting to grips with law and order.
To succeed, the programme needs the active co-operation of the police
service and police authorities - as ministers must have been aware when they
decided to abandon most of the more controversial recommendations of the
Sheehy report on police pay and conditions.
Imposing changes that have been vocally attacked by influential Conservative
peers and several former home secretaries might damage morale to a degree
that would outweigh the improved efficiency which, Mr Howard believes, would
flow from his reforms.
Mr Howard yesterday published proposals that will allow appeals against
unduly lenient sentences in serious and complex fraud cases. The
attorney-general will be given the power to refer such cases for
reconsideration by the Court of Appeal under amendments to the criminal
justice bill.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Troubled shipyard declares a profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-troubled Govan shipyard on the Clyde made its first profit in 30
years last year, its owner, Norwegian-based Kvaerner group, said yesterday.
Kvaerner described the profit as 'small' and declined to give a precise
figure. But it forecast a profit for this year of between Dollars 4m and
Dollars 5m.
Mr Jan Magne Heggelund, Kvaerner's senior vice-president for finance, said
Govan, which employs 1,500 workers, had orders that stretched into 1995.
These included four chemical tankers, and the last ship presently under
construction was not due for delivery until late 1996.
'We are working on various projects,' he said when asked about the
longer-term outlook.
Kvaerner acquired the Govan yard from British Shipbuilders in 1988 for
Pounds 6m, and has invested heavily in raising its efficiency since then.
The yard's fortunes were improved largely because of a broad restructuring
and efficiency improvements as it secured new orders valued at NKr853m
(Pounds 773m) compared with no new orders in 1992.
Mr Heggelund said the company would continue to invest in the yard.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Spike may foil cemetery vandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor John Knapton, professor of structural engineering at Newcastle
University, is to visit Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia next month
to offer advice about a structural problem encountered there.
Mr John C. Metzler, superintendent at the cemetery - at which John F.
Kennedy is buried - said yesterday that the 150,000 US government headstones
at Arlington, all marking graves of military personnel, had for cost reasons
simply been set 22 inches into the ground without foundations.
He said: 'The headstones constantly shift up and down, with the ground
freezing and thawing. We have tried a number of suggestions over the years
and nothing has been successful.'
Prof Knapton and his students may have the answer. They have developed a
simple spike and lock to anchor gravestones to the ground and fix them in
position. The mechanism was devised initially as part of a research project
for the Memorial Advisory Bureau, the main UK marketing and advisory body
for monumental masons.
It is intended to foil vandals and permit masons to unbolt headstones for
temporary removal to the workshop when a new inscription is required.
The device would cost about Pounds 35 a unit to manufacture, and would not
be visible above ground. It has been patented by Nuventures, the
university's technology transfer company.
The North-East Co-operative Society's Funeral Service, which carries out
15,000 funerals a year and is the largest in north-east England, said
vandalism of gravestones caused great distress to relatives.
'We would be very interested in seeing this new type of device. We would
always look at anything which might help the problem of vandalism,' it said.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Ulster talks cry out for early success: Leaders of Northern
Ireland's main parties speak to David Owen on possible problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gamble appears to have failed. Now it is time to revert to more orthodox
methods.
With hopes of an early IRA response to the Downing Street declaration fading
fast, London has been trying to inject momentum into the three-year-old
talks process with Ulster's non-violent political parties.
It badly needs a success to prevent the impetus behind the drive for a
lasting settlement for the province from draining away.
There are also hopes that progress in the political talks might yet be the
lever that eventually persuades republican leaders to ditch the armed
struggle and embrace the process. As Dr John Alderdice, leader of the
non-sectarian Alliance party, puts it: 'As Sinn Fein sees the train drawing
out of the station, they may be prepared to jump on board.'
Yet a series of Financial Times interviews in recent days with the leaders
of the four main constitutional parties indicates that many serious
obstacles still stand in the way of a positive outcome.
The leaders' comments, in brief, point to a long and tortuous process with
success far from assured.
The words with which the Rev Ian Paisley greeted the announcement by the
then Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke in March 1991 that a basis
for formal political talks existed still seem apposite.
'The gate into the field has been opened,' the leader of the hardline
Democratic Unionist party said at the time. 'But . . . there is a lot of
hard ploughing in front of us.'
The main problem areas appear to be as follows:
The 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula.
This, by definition, precludes the possibility of gradual progress. Every
syllable and punctuation mark has to be agreed before anything can be set in
stone.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, regards the principle as 'crucially important'. It ensures the
talks address all the relationships - within Northern Ireland, between north
and south, and between the two governments, he says.
An agreement confined to the question of 'who wields power in Northern
Ireland' would not necessarily solve the province's problems, Mr Hume
believes.
Unionists favour a less ambitious framework paving the way for a return to
devolved government in Ulster, independent of what might be agreed in the
other two 'strands' of the talks process.
They point out that a blueprint for an Ulster assembly was drawn up by a
working party comprising all four constitutional parties during the talks
initiated by Mr Brooke.
Mr Paisley says openly that, as far as he is concerned, the formula no
longer applies. It was exposed as a 'fallacy' during the 'failed' Brooke
talks process, he says.
How to handle the relationship between the north and Dublin.
There is no disguising the fundamental differences between the participants
on this second strand of the talks process.
An Ulster Unionist party document to be published this month will argue that
the relationship should be handled by ad hoc meetings between Irish
ministers and Ulster assembly representatives.
But proposals implying that no separate north-south institution - such as a
dedicated secretariat - is necessary would probably be anathema to the SDLP
and to Dublin.
Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, goes so far as to say: 'Not only are the
institutionalised bits unnecessary, but they are unconstitutional. 'They
would tend to tie elected representatives from one part of the United
Kingdom into bargains/arrangements/undertakings without our sovereign
government being aware of it,' he says.
The DUP's boycott of the talks.
Not only is Sinn Fein excluded from the talks process. So at present is the
DUP. While this could make agreement between those who are participating
less difficult to achieve, it might also undermine its effectiveness.
As Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said yesterday: 'A
political settlement that brings peace is one that has to have widespread
acceptance.'
The current DUP line is that it will not return to the talks until London
explicitly rules out any possibility of a united Ireland. According to one
senior DUP official, London would have to 'embark on a new security policy
that demonstrates the British are here to stay, irrespective of consent'.
The reluctance of some participants to move from bilateral discussions back
to a round-table format.
After the experience of the Brooke talks, some are wary of returning to what
they see as the 'goldfish-bowl' of round-table discussions.
There is though a general recognition that the current time-consuming
bilateral structure cannot continue indefinitely.
Mr Molyneaux favours 'a fair amount of commonality' being established before
participants go back to sitting around a table. The two governments'
apparent inability to prevent a continuation of terrorism.
It is in Mr Hume's words 'quite obvious' that the talks process's prospects
of success would be improved immeasurably if they took place 'in an
atmosphere of total peace'.
That is why the SDLP leader says he has pleaded for patience in awaiting
Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration. Continuing terrorist killings
can only exacerbate tensions.
But can a cessation of violence be delivered even in the event of an end to
the IRA's 25-year campaign? Mr Paisley, for one, is pessimistic.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Average family faces Pounds 1,000 tax increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday disclosed that tax rises from April 1995 will cost
a family on average earnings more than Pounds 1,000 a year.
If reductions in mortgage tax relief are added to the official figures,
Labour said the tax rise would be more than Pounds 1,250 a year - the 'tax
bombshell' the Conservatives accused Labour of planning during the last
general election campaign.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: 'In the interests of
honesty and standards the Tories should now put up billboards in every
constituency saying the Conservative government is responsible for the
Pounds 1,000 plus tax rise.'
Confirmation of the new tax increases were contained in a written answer
from Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, to Ms Harriet Harman,
Labour's Treasury spokesman.
Figures show that a married man on average earnings with two children will
pay Pounds 22.32 more in tax per week in April 1995. This amounts to Pounds
1,160 more a year in tax.
The Conservative party's credentials as the party of low taxation have
already been under attack after the recent publication of figures showing
that the government will from April take more in tax from the average family
than Labour did.
As a result of the 1993 Budgets the total tax paid by a married man on
average earnings will rise from Pounds 118.36 a month to Pounds 130.88 in
April, and then to Pounds 140.68 from April 1995.
The change in tax paid since 1979, when Labour was last in office, as a
percentage of earnings in direct and indirect taxes, is 35 per cent from
April, rising to 36.2 per cent in 1995-96. That compares with 32.2 per cent
in 1978-1979.
Mr Dorrell accused Labour of ignoring the fact that income tax and National
Insurance contributions as a share of gross national product would still be
only 16.2 per cent in April 1995 compared with 18.4 per cent under Labour in
1979.
'I am delighted for Labour to raise tax as an issue since the best way to
cut taxes is to get spending under control which Labour could never
achieve,' he said.
He also argued that Labour's figures were hypothetical because the tax rises
had not yet come into force and did not take account of the Pounds
30-per-week increase in the living standards of a typical family.
However, Ms Harman said: 'There is nothing hypothetical about the
government's figures since they relate to what has already been put into
law. Having failed on tax they cannot claim competence in economic
management.'
From April personal allowances are frozen, the married couple allowance is
cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, National Insurance goes up and VAT is
levied on domestic fuel at 8 per cent.
The new 3 per cent insurance premium tax comes into force from October and
air passenger tax from November.
From April 1995 the full 17.5 per cent is levied on domestic fuel and the
married couple allowance is cut by another five per cent to 15 per cent.
The government figures do not include cuts in mortgage tax relief from 25
per cent to 20 per cent in April followed by another 5 per cent cut to 15
per cent the following year.
In a parliamentary answer to Ms Harman two weeks ago the Treasury said cuts
in mortgage tax relief would cost a typical family with a Pounds 30,000
mortgage Pounds 4.40 a week from April 1995.

FT  18 FEB 94 / April shake-up 'to slow upturn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic recovery will slow next year because of the impact of April's
planned tax increases, says a London Business School forecast. It expects
growth in UK gross domestic product to fall to 2.2 per cent in 1995, after
2.5 per cent this year.
The latest edition of the LBS's Economic Outlook says tax increases of a
similar magnitude have only been imposed three times during the past 30
years.
On each occasion the result was sluggish growth in consumer spending.
The same impact is predicted next year with the LBS forecasting a rise of
just 1.1 per cent in consumer spending in 1995.
It also predicts that inflation will sit in the top half of the government's
1 per cent to 4 per cent target range until 1997. It believes underlying
inflation, excluding mortgage payments, will be 3.1 per cent this year, 3.4
per cent in 1995, 3.3 per cent in 1996 and 3.1 per cent in 1997.
As a result the LBS expects the government to raise interest rates next
year. It predicts base rates will average 5.8 per cent next year and 6.4 per
cent in 1996, before falling back to 5.5 per cent in 1997. Rising rates will
reinforce the slowdown in economic activity.
Unemployment will fall, according to the LBS, but only as far as 2.4m in
1997. 'Increased labour market flexibility should allow the economy to grow
on a lower real wage and productivity growth path, at least while
unemployment remains so high,' it says.
'However, whether this improved performance would allow the UK to sustain
unemployment of below 2m without a serious resurgence of inflation is still
open to question,' it adds.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Mirror to raise bid for Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers is preparing to increase
its bid for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday.
No final decision has been taken but discussions took place yesterday
involving Hambros and Schroders, representing members of the consortium, and
SG Warburg, which acts for Newspaper Publishing. Earlier this month the
consortium, which apart from MGN, includes the two largest existing
shareholders of The Independent, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy
and a group of founders led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, bid 261.6p a share
for the company.
The bid was immediately trumped by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers
of Ireland which bought 24.99 per cent of the company at 350p a share. The
consortium already controls just under 48 per cent of Newspaper Publishing.
An increased offer to persuade some of the remaining institutional
shareholders of the company to sell would give the consortium a majority
stake and allow it to go ahead with its plans.
These include following MGN staff to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands and
offering MGN a contract to provide all the services the paper needs apart
from editorial.
Talks could continue over the weekend with a planned meeting between Mr
O'Reilly and Mr Whittam Smith.
Meanwhile Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said
yesterday in a written answer that he had received an application from the
consortium to acquire a controlling interest in Newspaper Publishing. The
consortium is asking that such a deal should not be referred to the
Monopolies Commission.
Mr Heseltine can allow the transfer of ownership of a newspaper without an
inquiry if he is satisfied 'the newspaper concerned is not economic as a
going concern and as a separate newspaper'.

The Association of British Insurers yesterday backed a drive to examine
selling practices in the financial services industry by finding a common
basis for assessing how many policies lapse soon after they are bought.
It has suggested to Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life
insurance industry, that it might develop a method and agreed definitions
for collecting data about 'persistency'. It also proposed that such
information should cover products sold through independent financial
advisers as well as through life companies.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Incentives call for merchant shipping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday urged to provide fiscal incentives to halt the
decline in Britain's merchant fleet by Mr Donald Anderson, a Labour defence
spokesman.
In the Commons he was joined by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for
Upminster and chairman of the cross-party defence committee, in doubting
whether enough merchant ships would be available to support a task force
similar to that mounted for the Falklands war in 1982.
Mr Anderson said fiscal incentives would help to ensure that Britain
retained a 'core' of merchant ships capable of meeting the requirements of
the the ministry of defence in any emergency.
Sir Nicholas said the government had rejected a suggestion by the British
Chamber of Shipping that a random test should be carried out this year to
establish the number of British and foreign merchant ships available for
charter by the ministry of defence.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Consumer surveys at odds over recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More conflicting signals about the state of economic recovery emerged this
week with two surveys of consumer confidence, Graham Bowley writes.
A Barclaycard/Gallup survey published yesterday showed that two-thirds of
consumers remained unconvinced that Britain was coming out of the recession.
In contrast the Birmingham Midshires Building Society, in a survey conducted
by ICM Research, reported that consumer confidence was at its highest level
for four months.
Mr Mike McManus, Barclaycard commercial director, said: 'A large number of
consumers are still saying they are unconvinced that recovery is on the
way.'
But Mr Mike Jackson, Birmingham Midshires chief executive, said: 'Everything
is now right for sustained recovery across industry, manufacturing and in
the high street.'
Barclaycard found some reasons for optimism. The survey showed that pressure
on household budgets may be easing and consumers could return to certain
forms of credit.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Precedent fears follow Inland Revenue ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Lords yesterday ruled against Matrix Securities, the investment
adviser which tried to launch an Enterprise Zone Trust in the London
Docklands, in a judgment with potentially wide-ranging implications for
taxpayers.
Five law lords agreed unanimously that the Inland Revenue was entitled to
overrule the pre-clearance given on an investment scheme by an inspector not
qualified to make the decision.
The judgment triggered warnings from tax practitioners that it could set a
dangerous precedent in the knowledge required by taxpayers seeking Revenue
rulings.
Mr Peter Wyman, head of tax for Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said it suggested that in
future the taxpayer would have an obligation to know to whom in the Revenue
they had to send any proposal for clearance.
He said a judgment in favour of Matrix would have been against the interests
of equity, but that the implications were 'deeply worrying and a bad
precedent'.
The Revenue confirmed that it believed the impact of the judgment was that
taxpayers seeking pre-clearance had to reveal all relevant information,
indicate that they were seeking fully considered guidance, and approach the
appropriate division or grade of inspector.
The Matrix South Quay scheme was launched last September. According to Mr
David Royds, chairman of Matrix Securities, it had almost raised its full
subscription of Pounds 95m before the Revenue withdrew its clearance on
October 8. The judgment in the House of Lords upheld findings in favour of
the Revenue against Matrix in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
Mr Royds said he was 'very disappointed and surprised' at the decision and
that the company was still studying the judgment to see what further action
it might take.
The law lords were critical of the tax inspector who provided initial
clearance, and who admitted he had not read all details of the case.
The Revenue would not comment on his fate. It said last night: 'What happens
to him will be an internal management matter. He came under a great deal of
pressure to deal quickly with a very complicated tax avoidance scheme.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / Major and Reynolds to hold meeting before international game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic,
will hold only a short meeting before tomorrow's rugby international at
Twickenham in London and expect to issue no formal statement.
This emerged last night in a letter sent by the prime minister to the Rev
Ian Paisley in response to the Democratic Unionist party leader's request
for a meeting before the Irish leader's visit.
The meeting between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds - which comes just a week
before Sinn Fein's party conference - has been billed as a bid to restore a
common front to efforts to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland.
Mr Paisley said he now hoped to meet Mr Major 'possibly next week'. Mr Major
had asked him meanwhile to write to him with any specific points he wished
to raise before Mr Reynolds's arrival.
Downing Street confirmed last night that the prime minister would be happy
to see the DUP leader. His list of engagements had made it impossible to
arrange a meeting at the time requested.
The DUP leader - whose party is boycotting the political talks co-ordinated
by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister - said the first thing
he wanted to talk to Mr Major about was the increase in violence.
His comments came as Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social
Democratic and Labour party, claimed in the Commons that loyalists had
carried out 18 attacks on SDLP party members in recent months.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Glaxo hit by counterfeit drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, the UK's biggest pharmaceutical company, has been the victim of a
counterfeiting of its top selling anti-ulcer treatment Zantac for the first
time since 1989.
The fraud has prompted the Medicines Control Agency, an arm of the
Department of Health, to send a drug alert to the 60,000 doctors and
pharmacists practising in the UK.
Drugs counterfeiting is lucrative and widespread in south and eastern Europe
but is relatively rare in the UK.
Some counterfeits consist of illegally manufactured versions of the drug, as
in this case. Others are medically useless or damaging, where capsules might
contain materials such as flour.
Glaxo said yesterday that it became aware of the problem shortly before
Christmas when a patient in London became suspicious.
Laboratory tests showed that the tablets, packaged as Azantac 771, the
French trade mark, were counterfeit. The tablets were discoloured and lacked
the second 'A' in the embossed 'Azantac' logo.
Glaxo said it had no idea of the extent of the fraud, but it was the first
time counterfeit Zantac pills had been sold in the UK since 1989 when a
version arrived after being manufactured in a house in Athens.
The news coincided with first-half results from the pharmaceuticals company
which showed a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.001bn and an increase in
the dividend to 9p. It will come as a blow to the company because Zantac
sales growth is slowing down in the face of rival products coming off patent
being sold as cheaper generic versions.
The Medicines Control Agency said: 'We are only aware of one incidence so
far. The drug does contain the essential active ingredients but we are
concerned because it does not come from a licenced manufacturer which has
been properly inspected.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / Daewoo to set up design centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daewoo Motor, the South Korean vehicle maker, is setting up a design and
engineering centre in the UK as part of its expansion into world car
markets.
It has taken over the facilities and staff of International Automotive
Design in Worthing, West Sussex, where it plans to form the Daewoo Worthing
Technical Centre.
IAD, formerly a leading UK automotive design and engineering company, was
taken over from the receiver last year by Mayflower, the specialist
automotive engineering group.
The move by Daewoo is a bold step by the smallest of the big three South
Korean carmakers to create a global design and engineering presence to
accelerate the development of its new-vehicle programme.
The South Korean motor industry has embarked on a rapid expansion overseas
and both Hyundai and Kia, Daewoo's bigger domestic rivals, have entered many
European car markets.
Hyundai cars were launched in the US in 1986 and Kia is entering the US
market for the first time this year.
The Daewoo Motor technical centre in the UK has a workforce of about 200 and
is recruiting additional engineering specialists, product planners and
designers.
The technical centre plans to start work this year on a project to design
and develop a range of medium-sized family cars. It aims to take on a new
vehicle project each year.
Daewoo Motor plans to establish itself as one of the top 10 carmakers in the
world and is seeking to more than triple its world production capacity.
It recently bought a 51 per cent stake in Oltcit, a Romanian vehicle maker,
to provide it with its first production base in Europe.
This follows the signing of several contracts for potential joint-venture
projects in Uzbekistan, Iran, the Philippines and Vietnam.
Its export drive follows the collapse in 1992 of its eight-year-old 50-50
partnership with General Motors, under which it supplied to GM in the US a
Korean-built version of the Opel Kadett.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Airbus criticises lack of political
support - Loss of Saudi jet order dismays consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four partners in Airbus - Deutsche Aerospace and Aero-spatiale each with
37.9 per cent, British Aerospace with 20 per cent and Casa of Spain at 4.2
per cent - expressed dismay and criticism yesterday over the Dollars 6bn
Saudi contract for aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the parent company of Deutsche Airbus, blamed the
lack of political support in Germany and Europe for the failure of Airbus to
win any part of the contract for 50 airliners.
'The order was awarded on political grounds, and not on the basis of
economics,' Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, the Dasa director responsible for civil
aircraft production, said.
He said that while President Bill Clinton had intervened forcefully on
behalf of US industry, political support in Germany, in particular, and
Europe in general had been comparatively weak.
He warned that the failure to win any share of the contract - unless the
decision was altered - would result in further job cuts at Deutsche Airbus.
'Since Airbus aircraft have not been considered for this major contract up
till today, the pace of Airbus production will have to be adapted in the
near future,' he said. Airbus said it did not know if the US contract
represented the whole Saudi order or if there was more to come.
He had no doubt that if the contract from Saudia, the Saudi airline, had
been decided on price and quality alone, the Airbus would have proved
clearly superior to its US competitors.
Airbus Industrie, the European consortium of aircraft makers, said it
intended to scrutinise the terms of the deal to see whether it contravened
the Gatt agreement. 'We'll be looking very carefully at the terms that the
US has offered,' said Airbus.
Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, has for the past year been
negotiating with Saudia over the sale of its A340 long-range aircraft and
its smaller A320s. It has still not been officially notified about the US
contract.
Construcciones Aeronauticas (Casa), the state-owned Spanish aerospace
company, said: 'It is bad news for Airbus and therefore it is bad news for
Casa.' The Airbus consortium accounts for some 20 per cent of Casa's
turnover, and together with the EFA fighter project in which Casa is also a
partner, the European airliner constitutes the domestic industry's main
access to technology and international partnerships.

Japan's prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, told ministries yesterday to
draft emergency market-opening measures, possibly before the end of next
week, to contain the growing trade friction with the US, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
A special cabinet meeting was also expected today to speed up drafting of
the 'voluntary' measures he promised after last week's US-Japan summit broke
down over Washington's demands for numerical market access targets.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said: 'We must draw up more
concrete and visible measures as soon as possible. . . Hosokawa and the top
(trade) negotiators agreed that the ball is in Japan's court.'
As for specific timing for the new measures, he said: 'As soon as possible,
maybe before the next G7 gathering.' Finance ministers and central bank
governors from the Group of Seven top industrialised nations meet in
Frankfurt, Germany on February 26.
Mr Takemura said the two nations should calm down and halt the trans-Pacific
war of words. 'In the last stage of the Japan-US framework talks, the two
sides agreed to a cooling-off period.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Clinton &amp; Co's sales machine cashes in -
'High-level advocacy' pays dividends for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 6bn Saudi order for commercial jets, announced on Wednesday, was
the climax of an extraordinary sales effort by the Clinton administration in
concert with McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, which will share the fruits of
the victory.
It represents the admin-istration's commitment to 'high-level advocacy',
matching the efforts of foreign leaders who routinely promote their products
during state visits. Before this deal was clinched, Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, and Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, had
promoted the aircraft in Riyadh, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, had
gone there twice.
President Bill Clinton, who triumphantly announced the deal, admitted that
he has no difficulty in 'asking for business'. At the suggestion of Mr
Brown, he had telephoned King Fahd last year to urge him to 'buy American'.
In response to business criticism, President Bush led the way for a
government role in overseas sales. In 1990 he and cabinet officials lobbied
for a multi-million dollar telecommunications deal with Indonesia to secure
a contract for AT&amp;T. But even that was criticised by some in US business as
'defensive' and arranged hastily when it seemed that NEC of Japan would get
the sale.
It did lack the kind of synchronisation that the Clinton administration has
been developing under its Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which
represents the view of the 19 different agencies involved in export
promotion. Swift approval by the US Export-Import Bank of a preliminary
commitment to finance the Saudi deal was one result of this co-ordination.
The administration has clearly come some distance since the US Council on
Competitiveness issued a report warning of 'a fragmented system of policy
development . . . mirrored by a fragmented information and intelligence
system across government agencies and between government and industry'.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Curbs 'mar free-trade stance' - Gatt takes
US to task over barriers in bilateral disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Gatt's latest report on US trade policies and practices, published
yesterday, warns that domestic pressure for bilateral action against Japan
and others threatens the openness of the US trade regime and the
multilateral system.
As the world's largest trading nation, with imports and exports at 14 and 12
per cent of world trade, 'any distortions stemming from trade intervention
have significant adverse effects on world trade and the international
economy,' Gatt says.
The report, written before the latest flare-up in US-Japanese trade
relations, says the growing role of international trade in the US economy,
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the completion of the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks have all helped to bring trade issues to the
centre of domestic economic policy debate.
By and large, the US remains a very open economy, the report makes clear.
This has helped to boost productivity and competitiveness, smoothed the path
of industrial adjustment and aided production and export growth 'without the
dramatic employment losses experienced by other countries'.
However, Washington's adherence to free-trade principles is marred by high
tariffs and other trade barriers in agriculture and textiles, continued
bilateral pressure to prise open foreign markets and a significant increase
over the past two years in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions.
Gatt notes that, despite improved competitiveness and higher US export
earnings, falling US saving rates, 'largely associated with federal budget
deficits', have generated current account deficits. This has resulted in
pressure for protection against high-saving countries with which the
bilateral deficits are greatest, the report says.
Gatt takes a generally dim view of recent US agreements aiming to increase
access to Japanese markets. Though most of these refer to imports from all
sources, they are focused on sectors of particular export interest to the
US. Two industry-to-industry deals relate specifically to US-made goods,
notably one on car parts concluded in January 1992 under which Japanese
carmakers agreed to double imports of US components between 1990 and 1994.
The report says the US has recently made 'relatively restrained' use of its
unilateral trade powers under Section 301 of the US Trade Act and related
legislation. Only six new Section 301 cases were initiated in the two years
to June 1993 compared with an average of nearly five a year since 1974.
Nevertheless, the existence of these procedures remains a running sore with
trading partners who, as the report remarks, point to 'the contradictions
inherent in laws aimed at opening markets based on threats to close the US
market'.
Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions - increasingly labelled the
protectionists' weapon of choice - have increased in the past two years,
partly due to a flurry of steel suits brought after voluntary export
restraint arrangements expired in 1992.
The number of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders in force rose from
204 and 70 respectively in June 1991 to 268 and 86 in June 1993. The share
of imports subject to orders grew from 0.2 to 0.9 per cent of total goods
imports between 1988 and 1992.
Alleged bias in the operation of US laws has led to a rising number of
challenges under Gatt's anti-dumping and subsidies codes. Accusations of
trade harassment are given some credence by the fact that 80 per cent of
investigations result in preliminary findings of dumping under
semi-automatic procedures. However, when brought to the International Trade
Commission of the US, nearly half the cases are thrown out because the
alleged dumping has not been shown to cause injury to the domestic industry.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Brittan distances himself from dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, European trade comissionner, yesterday sought to distance
himself from the damaging trade dispute between the US and Japan by
stressing that Europe did not intend to copy the US in its threat of
punitive trade sanctions, Gillian Tett reports.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr Brittan said that although Europe was extremely
con-erned about its growing trade deficit with Japan, it intended to adopt a
more collab-orative approach in seeking to reduce the deficit.
He said the EU would seek to use a mixture of diplomatic pressure, backed by
extensive trade monitoring to persuade the Japanese government to open its
markets, he added, noting that in the last two years European exports to
Japan have fallen by 4.5 per cent.
Nevertheless, with many EU officials now increasingly concerned about the
impact that the US row with Japan might have on the Gatt deal, Sir Leon
yesterday called for a new trilateral initiative to discuss trade issues
between Japan, the US and Europe.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The United States found itself friendless in Gatt yesterday in its
heightening trade row with Japan following the breakdown of talks between
President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister,
last weekend.
Fellow members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade seized the
chance during discussion of a Gatt report on US trade policy to slam what
they saw as Washington's attempt to manage bilateral trade with Japan, to
the detriment of other nations and the multilateral system as a whole.
The US argument - that its goal is to open markets for the benefit of all -
failed to mollify trading partners. More than 20 rich and poor countries,
among them European Union states, Mexico, Australia, Canada, South Korea and
Poland, expressed concern over US demands for numerical targets for Japanese
imports and threats of trade retaliation.
Mr Tran Van Thinh, EU ambassador to Gatt, said these threats highlighted
'the doubtful and disquieting nature' of the US aims. While the EU agreed
with the need to reduce the excessive and persistent Japanese trade surplus,
the remedies proposed by the US would be worse than the disease.
Mr Mitoji Yabunaka, of the Japanese mission in Geneva, said Tokyo 'could
not, did not and will not agree to set numerical targets' for imports. The
Japanese government was, however, prepared to tackle the trade surplus by
stimulating the economy and opening markets on a non-discriminatory basis.
The US federal budget deficit was the key to redressing the trade balance,
Mr Yabunaka argued, noting that the US had failed to deliver on previous
assurances made to Japan in 1990 that it would eliminate the deficit within
3-4 years.
The US-Japan dispute was given an extra twist this week when Japanese
officials accused Washington of 'dirty tricks' in withdrawing certain tariff
offers made during the Uruguay Round talks.
US negotiators say the offers, on wood, white spirits and some industrial
electronic goods, were always conditional on tariff concessions by Japan
which never materialised. However, Mr Nobutoshi Akao, Japan's chief
negotiator in the Uruguay Round, claimed on Wednesday that offers in place
when the round ended in December could only be improved upon, not retracted.
Trade diplomats said yesterday that the US, EU and Canada had made clear
that they would scrap tariffs on wood and white spirits only if Japan did so
as well. EU officials say the withdrawal of certain tariff offers to Japan
is currently 'under consideration'.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: UN plan for eco-friendly products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for a certification scheme for environmentally friendly products
from developing countries are being drawn up by the United Nations in a bid
to head off the growing threat of trade discrimination against poor nations
from proliferating labelling requirements.
Announcing the initiative yesterday, Mr Kenneth Dadzie, secretary general of
the UN Conference on Trade and Development, said industrialised-country
labelling and certification rules for environment-friendly goods often
ignored the nature of products and production processes in developing
nations. Inappropriate standards, and onerous information requirements,
could make it difficult for Third World exporters.
The proposals, being worked on by Unctad and the UN Environment Programme,
would have three key elements, Mr Dadzie said. These were: the use of
equivalent environmental standards, allowing certification of goods that
helped the local environment in the producing country; mutual recognition of
certification schemes; and local standards-setting within internationally
agreed guidelines.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Robot tellers run amok in Chemical Bank accounts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In one of the most embarrassing computer glitches ever to hit a big retail
bank, Chemical Bank yesterday said that it had accidentally taken millions
of dollars out of thousands of its customers' checking accounts.
Any of Chemical's 1m customers in the New York city area who withdrew cash
from the bank's automated teller machines on Wednesday faced a nasty shock
yesterday. The bank's computer debited each withdrawal twice from customers'
accounts, leaving many customers in the red.
Irate customers who called the bank yesterday morning were told that
Chemical was still investigating the extent of the problem, and that efforts
were being made to re-credit the money to their accounts by the close of
business.
Cheques would not be bounced if customers' accounts had been debited by
mistake, the bank added.
The problem occurred while 'we were doing some systems modifications', the
bank said. This had led to an 'error in routing', though it did not
elaborate further. 'Tens of thousands of transactions' were affected, it
said.
A bank employee at one of Chemical's service centres said it was still
unclear how the problem had occurred, but that the bank was looking into it.
Some 900 automated teller machines, or one out of every five which dispense
cash in the metropolitan area, are owned and run by Chemical, the city's
second biggest retail banking institution after Citibank. Chemical has 1m
customers in the New York area.
The answer to one question remained unclear yesterday: if the bank's
computer was debiting money from thousands of its customers' accounts, whose
account was it crediting? 'There was no loss to customers or the bank. It
wasn't a fraud,' the bank said.

<TEXT>
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, confirmed yesterday that the US would
become the first nation to charge a fee to applicants for political asylum.
But she added that the charge - Dollars 130 per head  - would be waived for
those who clearly could not afford it.
The Immigration and Naturalisation Service, under new rules that could take
effect as early as October, will also delay issuing temporary work permits
to asylum seekers for 150 days as part of a drive to cut the asylum backlog
and to prevent abuse of the system.
Permits are normally issued within 90 days pending the adjudication process,
which may take years. Rather than risk eventual deportation, many applicants
use work permits to create new identities and disappear into the underground
economy.
The income from the fees will be used to double the size of the asylum
processing corps, which is currently only 150-strong. The asylum backlog
already stands at 364,000.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Boost to US growth prospects: Consumer prices flat although
inflation fears stalk Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of a zero increase in consumer prices last month and a sharp fall in
the trade deficit in December to Dollars 7.4bn added credibility yesterday
to the Clinton administration's forecast of sustained non-inflationary
growth.
On Wall Street, however, this encouraging news was overshadowed by traders'
negative reaction to a report on regional economic conditions by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The bank's index of manufactured goods' prices
rose sharply, raising fears in an already jittery market that inflation
would rise later this year, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy more
aggressively.
After a rally in early trading, the bond market went sharply into reverse.
By late afternoon the long bond was down 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield
above 6.5 per cent. Share prices also fell sharply in volatile trading.
The consumer price index was flat last month and up by only 2.5 per cent in
the year to January. Most analysts had predicted an increase of about 0.3
per cent.
Inflation was held down by the decline in world oil prices, which caused a
0.8 per cent fall in US energy prices, and by changes in seasonal
adjustments.
In recent years, blips in consumer prices in the first four months were
wrongly interpreted as a sign of increasing inflationary pressure.
The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy - rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent on an
annual comparison.
The merchandise trade deficit fell from Dollars 9.7bn in November to Dollars
7.4bn in December, the lowest shortfall in a year. However, the deficit for
1993 as a whole rose to Dollars 115.8bn, against Dollars 84.5bn in 1992.
Analysts had forecast a deficit in December of about Dollars 10bn. The
better than expected figures will probably result in an upward revision to
economic growth in the fourth quarter to 6.0-6.5 per cent, against the 5.9
per cent initially reported.
The trade improvement, however, may not be sustained. Exports were boosted
in December by an erratic increase in aircraft sales and by the decline in
oil prices, which held down imports.
Mr David Rolley, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group,
said import volumes were likely to grow twice as fast as exports this year,
reflecting faster growth in the US than elsewhere.
The trade deficit would probably rebound to Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn by
mid-year and hit Dollars 15bn by the end of the year.

FT  18 FEB 94 / De Beers and GE indicted over diamond prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric, the American conglomerate, and an affiliate of De Beers
Consolidated Mines, the South African mining house, were yesterday indicted
by the US Justice Department on charges of conspiracy to fix the worldwide
price of industrial diamonds.
The move follows a two-year Justice Department anti-trust investigation,
during which GE and De Beers, which together control more than 80 per cent
of output of industrial diamonds, denied collusion.
GE said yesterday there had been no anti-trust violation by it or its
employees. It would defend the case and was confident it would prevail at
trial.
The Justice Department's investigation grew out of claims by Mr Edward
Russell, a former executive of GE's superabrasives division, which makes
diamonds, that he had been fired by GE for blowing the whistle on
price-fixing.
However, on Wednesday, days before Mr Russell's lawsuit against GE was due
to go to trial, he withdrew his allegations and said he was now aware that
'GE removed me based on its view of my performance, and not because I was a
whistleblower'. He added that he had no knowledge indicating that GE
personnel had violated anti-trust laws.
Despite this retraction, the Justice Department yesterday filed an
indictment in the federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, against GE and
De Beers Centenary AG, as well as Mr Peter Frenz, a GE employee in Europe,
and Mr Philippe Liotier, a De Beers official.
It alleges that the conspiracy to fix prices began as early as 1991 and
continued through some time in 1992, and aimed to raise the list price of
various diamond products.
GE said 'the government is now trying to salvage its effort by bringing a
wholly circumstantial case of indirect price fixing that is without merit'.

The Venezuelan government says it will attempt to refloat Banco Latino, the

Mr Julio Sosa, the minister of finance, said on Wednesday that Latino would
be restored to financial health and reduced in size.
The recovery plan calls for providing new public and private sector capital

between the bank and its account holders and clients, and identifying those
responsible for allowing the bank to collapse. It it not yet clear where
fresh private capital will come from.
The government's plan is intended to give a sense of direction to its
handling of Banco Latino, which has been slow and uncertain. It also was
meant to quash speculation that the bank would be liquidated, and to
indicate that the government planned eventually to sell put the bank.
Latino has been effectively shut since January 14.

Reports of a zero increase in consumer prices last month and a sharp fall in
the trade deficit in December to Dollars 7.4bn yesterday added credibility
to the Clinton administration's forecast of sustained non-inflationary
growth.
Analysts said the unexpected fall in the trade deficit would lead to upward
revisions to economic growth in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of more
than 6 per cent.
Apparent absence of upward pressure on prices, meanwhile, reduced the
immediate risk of another increase in short-term interest rates. But good
inflation figures are unlikely to prevent further tightening of monetary
policy in coming months if the Federal Reserve concludes the economy is
growing faster than its long-run potential, and thus eliminating excess
capacity.
The consumer price index was flat last month and up by only 2.5 per cent in
the year to January. Most analysts had predicted an increase of about 0.3
per cent.
Inflation was held down by the decline in world oil prices, which caused a
0.8 per cent fall in US energy prices, and by changes in seasonal
adjustments. In recent years, blips in consumer prices in the first four
months were wrongly interpreted as a sign of increasing inflationary
pressure.
The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy - rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent on an
annual comparison.
The merchandise trade deficit fell from Dollars 9.7bn in November to Dollars
7.4bn in December, the lowest shortfall in a year. Analysts had expected a
gap of about Dollars 10bn.
The improvement mainly reflected a Dollars 2bn rise in exports to Dollars
42.2bn; imports fell Dollars 0.3bn to Dollars 49.6bn despite the economy's
strength at the end of the year.
The smaller trade gap will probably result in an upward revision in economic
growth in the fourth quarter to an annualised 6.0-6.5 per cent, against the
5.9 per cent initially reported.
The trade improvement, however, may not be sustained. Exports were boosted
in December by an erratic increase in aircraft sales, by a strong rebound in
car exports, and by the decline in oil prices, which held down imports.
Mr David Rolley, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group,

probably rebound to Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn by mid-year and hit Dollars
15bn by the end of the year.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Reno confirms fee for political asylum-seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, confirmed yesterday that the US would
become the first nation to charge a fee to applicants for political asylum.
But she added that the charge - Dollars 130 per head  - would be waived for
those who clearly could not afford it.
The Immigration and Naturalisation Service, under new rules that could take
effect as early as October, will also delay issuing temporary work permits
to asylum-seekers for 150 days as part of a drive to cut the asylum backlog
and to prevent abuse of the system.
Permits are normally issued within 90 days pending the adjudication process,
which may take years. Rather than risk eventual deportation, many applicants
use work permits to create new identities and disappear into the underground
economy.
The income from the fees will be used to double the size of the asylum
processing corps, which is currently only 150 strong, or a fortieth the size
of its German counterpart. The asylum backlog already stands at 364,000,
with more than 150,000 new applicants last year alone, and is still growing
at a rate of over 10,000 a month, according to the Immigration and
Naturalisation Service.
The controversial new approach reflects the scarcity of INS resources. With
little prospect of greater federal funding, the INS 'can only exist and
expand on the basis of fees', notes Mr Dmitri Papadimitriou, director of the
refugee and migration programme at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington.
The new charges, he adds, 'are a drop in the ocean' of what is needed and
the new rules are certain to be amended before October 1. Mr Papadimitriou
also saw a big internal fight in the INS over whether families or employers
of asylum-seekers should also be asked to fund the process.

<TEXT>
Mr Alfonso Bustamante, Peru's premier and trade and industry minister, has
resigned in the wake of last week's controversial move by parliament and the
executive against the autonomy of the Supreme Court.
Mr Efrain Goldenberg, a businessman who has headed the foreign ministry for
rather less than six months, replaces Mr Bustamante as premier. Mr
Goldenberg joined the cabinet last September with no previous political
background and no experience of diplomacy.
Mr Bustamante also headed Promperu, the government body charged with
improving Peru's tarnished image abroad and promoting exports.
His resignation is linked to the passage of a law last week, under pressure
from the military, switching jurisdiction over a case involving the
killingof nine students and a professor from civilian courts to a secret
military tribunal.
President Alberto Fujimori promulgated the law, but Mr Bustamante refused to
put his signature to it.

FT  18 FEB 94 / 'Clinton Lite' health plan gets a tasting: Slim-line
alternative proposal draws criticism as well as praise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's ambitious healthcare reform plan has suffered a
series of setbacks in recent weeks.
While the Congressional Budget Office shed doubt on the medium-term
financial consequences of the proposal, the Business Roundtable, an alliance
of heavyweight corporate interests, disavowed the president's plan and threw
its influence behind a rival approach promoted by Congressman Jim Cooper of
Tennessee.
Mr Cooper, a Democrat who is running in this year's race for the Senate seat
once held by Vice-President Al Gore, has pitched his proposals firmly in the
middle of the political spectrum. He likes to call his plan 'Clinton Lite',
a slimline version of the president's package, stripped of some of the
government involvement that Mr Clinton's Republican foes find so
objectionable.
The Cooper plan is, in fact, the only healthcare reform proposal before
Congress to have picked up endorsements from both Republican and Democratic
members.
But the limelight has brought with it a new degree of scrutiny, and the
details of Mr Cooper's proposals are coming in for searching criticism.
'I think that a more full exposition of Mr Cooper's bill is trouble for Mr
Cooper, not the administration,' said Congressman John Dingell, who, as
chairman of the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee,
holds sway over a large portion of any health reform legislation.
The Cooper plan is aimed at introducing a form of the managed competition
concept which has inspired many of the competing proposals.
Insurance companies and healthcare providers would be strongly encouraged,
by changes in the tax code, to form Accountable Health Plans. These plans
must offer a standard package of health benefits, to be defined by an
independent Health Care Standards Commission.
Health plans would be required to enroll anyone who applied for coverage.
They would be allowed to vary their premiums only by geographic location,
and to a limited degree by the age of the policyholder; not on the basis of
how sick people have been.
Small businesses and individuals would be able to enroll in Health Plan
Purchasing Co-operatives similar to the Clinton plan's Health Alliances, but
with a lower cut-off point - only businesses with fewer than 100 employees
would be able to join, whereas in the Clinton scheme all businesses with
fewer than 5,000 employees would be obliged to join.
Much of the support for Mr Cooper's ideas, however, stems from two central
points in which his plan differs from the president's.
Mr Cooper would merely ask businesses to offer health insurance to their
employees, not require them to pay for it. Mr Clinton, by contrast, has
sought to ensure universal coverage by obliging businesses to pay 80 per
cent of the cost of health coverage for all their full-time employees, a
mandate that has deterred many small companies that do not provide such
cover, and even many larger businesses that do.
A second difference is that both proposals claim they will bring market
forces to bear in the healthcare system as their principal cost control
mechanism. But while the Clinton plan would impose a cap on health insurance
premiums if prices rise too fast, the Cooper plan relies on a tax mechanism.
Health insurance benefits would be taxable if they exceeded the cost of the
lowest approved health plan in the same geographical area. This would, Mr
Cooper argues, encourage consumers to shop for the cheapest plan and
discourage 'Rolls-Royce' policies.
At the moment, health benefits may be fully deducted for the purposes of
corporate income tax by the employer, and fully excluded from personal
income tax by the employee. This loses the government about Dollars 65bn a
year in tax revenue.
For many of his fellow Democrats, the most damaging criticism now being
levelled at Mr Cooper's plan is that it can claim to offer only universal
access, not the universal coverage that Mr Clinton insists on and that most
polls suggest is strongly favoured by public opinion.
'When I get my LL Bean catalogue every year I've got universal access to all
kinds of warm clothes, but I don't have any coverage with those warm clothes
until I whip out my credit card,' says Congressman Bill Ford, another
influential House committee chairman. 'The thing that's missing from
Cooper's plan is a credit card.'
Mr Cooper offers government subsidies covering the entire cost of the
premium, estimated to range from Dollars 2,100 a year for a single person to
Dollars 5,565 for a two-parent family, for those with incomes below the
official poverty line - now Dollars 11,866. The subsidy would diminish on a
sliding scale to zero at twice the poverty line.
But as Mr Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at Washington's
Brookings Institution, pointed out in a recent critique, this would create a
poverty trap by withdrawing benefits from those whose incomes rise above the
poverty line - the equivalent of taxing income between Dollars 11,866 and
Dollars 23,732 at an effective rate of 88 per cent.
'Although the Tennessee Democrat calls his plan 'Clinton Lite' it is not
merely light but utterly empty on the central goal of the Clinton plan:
universal coverage,' Mr Aaron wrote in the New York Times.
Nonetheless, Mr Cooper and his backers seem likely to be an important voice
as congressional committees get down to hammering out a legislative
compromise.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Catalogue of disaster at BCCI: Former bank chief details
slide into insolvency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi was told in April 1990 that more than Dollars
3.2bn was needed to cover the losses and misappropriations at the ailing
Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
A three-page handwritten note from Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief
executive currently on trial in Abu Dhabi, says that the largest losses in
the bank came from its treasury division and from the Gokal shipping group.
It also states that losses had been stemmed through Dollars 2.2bn taken from
the portfolio of cash that Abu Dhabi gave to BCCI to invest on its behalf
through its operations in the Cayman Islands.
The document is one of more than a dozen submitted by Mr Naqvi during 1990
to senior officials in Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder.
The reports provide an insight into the circumstances leading to the
collapse of the bank, and into the mind of Mr Naqvi, who took over control
of BCCI after the health of Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, its founder and president,
had deteriorated.
It is unclear whether all the documents have come to light or whether they
present the complete picture of when and what Abu Dhabi knew about the
extent of fraud at the bank.
However, they appear to lend support to its contention that it was unaware
of the losses until Mr Naqvi confessed. Much of the information and
supporting interviews also formed the basis of a report submitted to the
Bank of England which led to the closure of BCCI in July 1991.
In a report dated September 1, 1990, Mr Naqvi says he could not previously
inform the ruler of Abu Dhabi of the financial difficulties at the bank, 'as
Mr Abedi when he was active himself was aware of its seriousness and was
trying to find some solution.'
He says he was 'caught unprepared' when Mr Abedi fell ill in 1988 and 'did
not have the courage to report immediately'. He says subsequent financial
problems 'made the bank's financial position so precarious that slightest
leakage of these matters would have caused its chaotic failure and would
have exposed the sensitivities in an uncontrolled manner.'
In other documents, he says large amounts of his time after 1988 were taken
up defending the bank against negative publicity, and he was hampered by his
lack of personal relationships in Abu Dhabi.
He says Mr Abedi came to Abu Dhabi in March 1990 to talk to Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al Nahyan, the ruler, but because of his illness Mr Naqvi instead
went with Mr Zafar Iqbal to inform Mr Mohammad Habroush, the minister of
finance, Mr Ganim Faris Al Mazrui, head of the ruler's department of private
affairs, and Mr Juaun Salim Al Dhahiri, now under-secretary in the finance
department.
It was at this point that Abu Dhabi began an investigation into the size of
the losses and ultimately drew up plans to restructure BCCI. Mr Mazrui said
last week that he did not at once inform the auditors or others because he
was uncertain of the truth of the fraud.
Mr Naqvi himself studiously avoids use of the word 'fraud' throughout his
reports, as well as in subsequent interviews he has held with investigators.
He says there was no intention to 'accumulate personal wealth'.
'The situation as it has developed is not justifiable on a rational basis,
but it developed and became out of control without any bad intention or any
motive of personal gain for any senior member of the management, including
Mr Abedi and myself'.
Mr Naqvi says Mr Abedi's objectives for BCCI were to build an organisation
to 'provide opportunities for the growth of people all over the world', and
become quickly self-supporting so it would provide steady income to
shareholders and be a source of charity and 'social good'.
He says the bank faced 'high costs', because of its small capital base, its
need for high dollar liquidity, the lack of a hard currency-denominated home
base and its lack of an official lender of last resort.
He says the decision by Bank of America, one of the initial large
shareholders, to sell its stake in 1978 caused early problems for the bank.
It was subsequently hit by the recession in the Middle East with the fall in
oil prices in the early 1980s, the property crisis in Hong Kong, the
Egyptian foreign currency crisis and the recession in the shipping industry.
BCCI had become highly dependent on the Gokal group, which he described in
April as resulting in accumulated losses of Dollars 1.3bn including
interest. His estimate at the time of other non-performing loans was Dollars
500m including interest, although more accurate calculations since have
inflated these figures further.
He says a fresh crisis was the decision of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former
chief operating officer of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, to
call on BCCI's pledge to buy back his shares, which led to a Dollars 435m
loan from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority in 1988.
He describes how treasury losses climbed to more than Dollars 1.2bn
including interest, and a series of payments of more than Dollars 30m to
members of the bank who might have revealed details of the large losses.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Industrialists urge India to reform tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian industry yesterday appealed to the government for an end to the
anomalies in the country's complex import duty rates under which imports of
finished goods are often taxed at lower rates than imports of raw materials
and components.
In an appeal before the 1994-95 budget on February 28, the Confederation of
Indian Industry placed newspaper advertisements urging ministers to reform
the country's duty structure to ease the burdens placed on domestic
manufacturing, particularly on the makers of machinery and other capital
equipment.
Such reforms have long been on the CII's agenda, but companies hope that
with a final pre-Budget appeal they can persuade Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the
prime minister, and Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, to at least
start removing anomalies.
Since Mr Narasimha Rao launched an economic liberalisation programme in
mid-1991, import duties have been cut from a maximum of 150 per cent to 85
per cent, gradually exposing Indian industry to competition.
However, duties on capital goods have come down further to 35 per cent in
order to permit industry to equip itself with modern equipment of
international standards.
Duties on raw materials have remained much higher - mainly because producers
of steel and other basic products are largely state-owned and enjoy the
support of influential officials and politicians.
Domestic capital goods makers say they are being squeezed, especially as
orders from the cash-strapped state corporations have fallen in the wake of
government efforts to make them operate more efficiently.
Output of capital goods fell 7.6 per cent in 1991-92 and 1.8 per cent in the
year to last March. Imports of such equipment are rising fast - by 30 per
cent in the first seven months of 1993-94, compared with an increase in
overall imports of just 9.1 per cent.
Capital goods makers spell out the duty rates in their advertisement. The
duty on imported machine tools, for example, is 35 per cent; raw materials
such as carbon steel are charged at 85 per cent and components at 40 per
cent. In addition, domestic makers pay 10-15 per cent in sales tax on their
finished products.
Similarly, imported industrial valves attract duties of 35 per cent,
compared with 85 per cent on sealants, balls, gaskets and other components.
Again there is 10-15 per cent sales tax to pay on domestically produced
items.
Larsen &amp; Toubro, a leading engineering company, says it has lost orders to
foreign competitors simply because duties and taxes made it uncompetitive.
It is widely believed that the budget will include measures to rationalise
the duty structure - but it unlikely to contain the overhaul which the
capital goods makers seek.
Strikes closed banks in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and other parts of India as
employees stayed away from work in protest at government moves to partly
privatise state-owned banks, write R C Murthy in Bombay and Stefan Wagstyl.
Banking business was disrupted and cheque clearance suspended. The All-India
Bank Employees Association, a left-wing trade union, staged a protest march
in central Bombay. but the strike did not affect foreign banks or the State
Bank of India, the largest and most profitable nationalised bank.
The trade union's main concern is that efforts to prepare state-owned banks
for partial privatisation could involve job cuts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, held talks in Damascus yesterday
in an effort to persuade Syria's President Hafez al-Assad to prevail upon
Hizbollah fighters to curb intensified violence in south Lebanon which has
raised the threat of a punitive Israeli military operation.
Mr Hariri's trip followed the Lebanese government's receipt of a letter from
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in which he warned that the
renewed violence in the south was 'very dangerous' and risked 'torpedoing'
the resumed peace talks between Israel, Syria and Lebanon in Washington.
Syria exerts considerable influence, if not control, over the pro-Iranian
Hizbollah, which Mr Assad considers a valuable card in his peace
negotiations with Israel. Syria, under intense US and Israeli pressure, last
July agreed to curb Hizbollah activity after a series of rocket attacks into
north Israel prompted a massive week-long bombardment of dozens of villages
in south Lebanon.
Skirmishes continued at a lower level inside Israel's self-declared
'security zone' in south Lebanon, but then escalated significantly earlier
this month when Hizbollah fighters killed four Israeli soldiers in an
ambush. Israel retaliated with three air raids into south Lebanon.
On Wednesday Hizbollah fired a Katyusha rocket into northern Israel for the
first time since the pro-Iranian group reached its 'gentleman's agreement'
last July to restrict all attacks against Israel and its proxies to within
the 'security zone'. The rocket damaged a factory, but no-one was reported
injured.
Israel has called on the Lebanese government to disarm Hizbollah. Mr Hariri
and his government have repeatedly said they cannot and will not do so while
Israeli forces continue to occupy parts of south Lebanon.

The Australian government yesterday intervened to move more than ADollars
100m (Pounds 49m) worth of exports which have been held up in a nationwide
port strike, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne.
Mr Laurie Brereton, industrial relations minister, asked the Transport
Department to 'do everything possible' to move stranded cargo using the only
stevedore company, Conaust, which is not strike-bound.
This is the most significant intervention since the pilots' strike four
years ago when the government mobilised Air Force jets and pilots to fly
passengers. The strike began last week when Australian Stevedores sacked 55
workers in Sydney, the first compulsory port redundancies since the reform
programme.
The government intervention in the dock strike was caused by a need to
sustain the economic recovery, which has been helped by improving exports.

weeks ago, died of his wounds yesterday. And at least four Palestinians were
shot and wounded in clashes with the army in the West Bank town of Halhoul.

FT  18 FEB 94 / China's imports up 42.3% as trade deficit widens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chinese imports climbed by 42.3 per cent in January compared to the same
month last year, further widening China's trade deficit, which exceeded
Dollars 12bn last year.
The import surge underlines the difficulties facing the authorities in their
efforts to calm an economy which grew by 13 per cent last year and which
shows little sign of slowing.
Customs statistics showed that exports grew by 14.5 per cent in January to
Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 3.2bn) compared with imports of Dollars 5.7bn; a
Dollars 900m deficit for the month.
China's trade deficit of Dollars 12.2bn in 1993 compared with a surplus of
Dollars 4.4bn in 1992. In 1993, imports surged by nearly 30 per cent to
Dollars 104bn, while exports grew by only 8 per cent to Dollars 92bn.
According to western economists, the authorities are unlikely to resort to
administrative measures to curb imports. Among factors constraining Chinese
action are concerns about the possible impact of such steps on China's
efforts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Beijing was also thought unlikely to want to antagonise the US on the eve of
a decision on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status.
China's trade surplus with the US exceeded Dollars 20bn in 1993.
Chinese officials, quoted by the official China Daily, attributed much of
the import surge to the activities of China's more than 170,000
foreign-funded enterprises. Imports by these ventures jumped by 116 per cent
in January to Dollars 1.07bn. In 1993, imports by foreign funded enterprises
rose by 58.6 per cent to about Dollars 41.8bn or 40.2 per cent of total
imports.
China's weak export performance was partly attributable to a diversion of
exportable goods to the booming domestic market.
The surge in investment spending led to increased domestic demand for
traditional export items such as crude oil and oil products, steel, coal and
cement. Weak growth in leading export markets and rising domestic costs also
curtailed export growth.
Steel imports rose to more than 30m tons, valued at some Dollars 10bn.
Imports of oil products doubled to more than 14m tons which reflected both
the demands of a booming economy, and China's own flagging oil production.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Central player in Japanese political drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's political upheavals over the past month have been a painful yet
exhilarating experience for Mr Shigeru Ito.
He has spent most of that time attending meetings in smoke filled
restaurants and government offices, 'watching history walk in front of my
eyes'. Mr Ito, transport minister, confesses to taking the occasional
cat-nap at the conference table, to make up for his hectic schedule allowing
him only four to five hours of sleep per night.
As top political theorist in the Social Democratic Party, the largest and
most rebellious member of the governing seven-party coalition, Mr Ito has
been a central figure in the stormiest days in Japanese politics.
His party nearly destroyed the government's political reform plans last
month and then, 10 days ago, forced Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, to
shelve plans for a rise in sales tax, in a spectacular U-turn which obliged
him to redesign Japan's largest ever economic pump-priming package.
Mr Ito was at Socialist party headquarters with the party chairman and
secretary general, when Mr Hosokawa called a televised press conference to
announce his proposed tax increase in the early hours of February 3. 'I can
only say it astounded us. It was such an abrupt thing,' said Mr Ito, whose
party was elected on a pledge not to increase sales tax.
The trio discussed tactics before going to bed at 3am. Mr Ito was in his
ministerial office by 8am to clear up some routine business before he and
the five other Socialists in Mr Hosokawa's cabinet called on the prime
minister at 11am to protest.
The meeting started calmly, as the Socialists explained that despite their
election dogma, they could reluctantly compromise on tax if only Mr Hosokawa
would first go through the usual consensus forming and consultation process.
But the temperature unexpectedly rose when Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief
cabinet secretary, stormed into the meeting room, scarlet with fury. The
Socialists were astonished to learn that the tax announcement was also a
surprise to Mr Takemura, who is supposed to be the prime ministers' closest
assistant, as government spokesman.
It took five days for Mr Hosokawa to change his mind on tax, during which
'there was a constant stream of extraordinary cabinet meetings. I felt as if
there was no difference between night and day,' says Mr Ito.
There have been moments of real distress for Mr Ito. He winces as he recalls
how 17 Socialist members of the upper house crossed the floor to vote down
the government's political reform bills last month, forcing Mr Hosokawa to
make a compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to get a
majority for the plans.
'They are my long-standing friends and I feel personal pain that we now have
to exclude them from the party. In the old days, the left and right wings of
the party were free to advocate what they liked.' Now that the Socialists
are in government, for the first time in 47 years, 'people who cannot follow
party resolutions must be excluded,' he says.
Despite Mr Hosokawa's tax furore, Mr Ito likes his straight talking style, a
contrast to the elliptical pomposity of previous LDP prime ministers.
'He makes decisions fast and changes his mind just as fast. He doesn't
really struggle over it. That is both good and bad,' says Mr Ito.' Maybe
it's just the modern way.'
Despite his new generation image, the prime minister also keeps a certain
distance from his colleagues, attracting allegations of conceit from the
Japanese press. 'When he listens to you, his expression does not change ..I
went to his office the other day to say it was stupid to have a
confrontation with the US. He just nodded,' says Mr Ito.
Inadequate communication between the coalition members - including Mr
Hosokawa - is also a factor in the recent political chaos, Mr Ito believes.
He has an endearing practical solution in mind, which he plans to propose at
a future cabinet meeting: the creation of a cabinet ministers' tea-room in
the prime minister's residence. If the feudal lord agrees, those lengthy
political wrangles should get shorter and less disagreeable.

FT  18 FEB 94 / A divided Fiji faces further division: Nikki Tait finds
uncertainty surrounding the islands' general election today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parish hall on the outskirts of Suva, Fiji's capital, is spartan and
airless. Undeterred, hundreds of Fijians are packing into the final rally
held by the prime minister, Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, before the general
election today. Kava-drinking is under way, leading to a ceremonial welcome,
speeches and prayers.
Outside, matters are less harmonious. The Indian taxi drivers are getting
fretful, and a local scrap is brewing. 'These Fijians sit on my car,'
complains one, shaking a fist. 'I chase them away, but they keep coming
back.'
Trivial though the incident seems, it is a reminder of the racial tensions
that lurk behind Fiji's sandy beaches and graceful palms. These were acute
enough to cost Fiji its democratic system altogether in 1987, when it became
the first South Pacific country to have a military coup. Even now, with the
electoral process partly restored, there is little certainty about where the
week-long polling by the country's 330,000 voters will lead. A repeat of
1987 is not deemed likely, but other than that no one is sure.
As one lawyer in Suva puts it: 'There'll probably be a government in 10
days' time, but who'll be running it: who knows?'
The 1987 coup was triggered by fears that the economically dominant Indian
community was securing political advantage as well. Col Rabuka walked into
the parliament building with a group of soldiers and ousted what was viewed
as an Indian-dominated coalition government. After four uneasy months of
negotiations, he followed up with a second power grab, revoking the
country's 1970 constitution.
The international community's fears of an Idi Amin-style regime with
persecution and expulsion of Indians, were not realised. Many Indians did
leave Fiji, so that they now constitute only 45 per cent of the islands'
760,000 population. Seven years ago more than half the population was
Indian.
However, Col Rabuka quickly deregulated much of the economy, giving it an
export-oriented emphasis. The manufacturing sector expanded significantly,
thanks partly to the introduction of tax-free factory zones and the ability
to export garments, duty free, to Australia and New Zealand. Tourists,
scared off by the military action, returned.
In 1992, Fiji held national elections - albeit under a 1990 constitution
that guarantees indigenous Fijians a majority of the 70-seat parliament. Col
Rabuka's SVT party picked up 30 of a possible 37 seats. Through a coalition
with the General Voters' party, which holds the five general (non-Fijian,
non-Indian) seats, it was able to govern.
The tables turned on Col Rabuka last November. Seven of his SVT MPs refused
to pass the 1994 budget, causing him to call an election.
On the surface, the dissidents' concerns centred on government overspending,
including almost FDollars 10m (Pounds 4.6m) by the army last year. But few
observers think that was the only issue. There had been allegations of
government mismanagement in other areas by Col Rabuka's critics, ranging
from nepotism and unfulfilled promises, to a messy scandal - involving a
local businessman, Tony Stephens - in which the prime minister was
implicated.
The upshot of the dissidents' action was the formation of a new party called
the Fijian Association. This SVT rival is headed by Mr Josevata Kamikamica,
a former finance minister and a challenger for the prime minister's job
after the 1992 election.
On paper, the manifestos of the Fijian Association and the SVT differ
little. But the respected, Australian-educated Mr Kamikamica has talked of
bringing Indian MPs into the cabinet, and his softer style contrasts sharply
with Col Rabuka's. For the first time, the indigenous Fijian community -
including its powerful chiefs - is seriously split.
The Indian vote, by contrast, has been divided for some time.
In 1992, 13 of the community's 27 seats went to Mahendra Chaudry's Fiji
Labour party, and 14 to the National Federation party led by Jai Ram Reddy,
a lawyer.
Both parties recognise the two overriding concerns of the Indian community:
to make some progress on overhauling the racially biased constitution and to
resolve the issue of the thousands of 30-year farming leases, which begin to
expire in 1996. Most of these are held by Fiji-Indian sugar cane growers, on
Fijian-owned land.
All that can be said with certainty is that the political instability helps
no one. The country is operating without an approved budget for the current
year, and investment, especially re-investment by the Indian community, is
at a low ebb. Anything which threatens the tourism business - Fiji's largest
foreign exchange earner, generating almost FDollars 330m in 1992 - is also
unwelcome.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Blockade by Greece puts EU on spot

Greece's blockade against Macedonia could cause a serious diplomatic split
within the European Union and further complicate European policy towards
Bosnia, Brussels officials warned yesterday.
With Greece giving little warning of its intentions to its European
partners, Commission officials yesterday indicated that they had been both
surprised and angered by Greece's action, not least because it currently
holds the EU presidency.
'It is bad enough for a member state to act like this, but it is even worse
when they are heading the union,' commented one senior Commission official,
who feared the action could inflame Balkan tensions.
Mr Hans Van Den Broek, commissioner for external affairs, yesterday flew to
Athens, where he was due to meet Greek officials. His visit forms part of a
regular meeting between Russia, and foreign ministers from the three members
of the EU troika: Germany, Greece and Belgium. However, EU officials
yesterday indicated that Mr Van Den Broek was likely to seek to use the
meeting to pressure Greece over the issue.
Mr Nicolaas Wegter, Commission spokesman, said yesterday: 'We are concerned
about the situation and therefore are asking for clarification (from the
Greeks).'
France, Germany and Belgium yesterday all expressed their concern over
Greece's refusal to let Macedonia use the port of Thessaloniki, Macedonia's
main outlet to the sea.
Meanwhile, Denmark yesterday asked for the European foreign ministers to
discuss the issue when they meet in Brussels on Monday.
With some officials now suggesting that Greece's action may contravene EU
regulations governing trade and foreign relations, the Commission's legal
services have been asked to consider the legality of Greece's action.
However, diplomats yesterday indicated that Greece's move, which comes after
a month in which it has sought to distance itself from Nato's threat of air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, has left many diplomats uncertain about
what action can be used against Greece.
In spite of the deep irritation felt by some Commission officials, fears
about creating a deep rift in the Union has left many unwilling to demand
any co-ordinated European action against Greece yet, not least because it is
still too early to be sure what the blockade of the port will precisely
entail.
'If it's a matter of oil, that is serious and that will be a big problem.
But reports suggest that it might be less than that,' commented one
diplomat.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Fears grow over action against Macedonia: Blocking the
former Yugoslav republic's access to the sea may be dangerously
destabilising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's political leaders speak in smug cliches about the country's
importance as a 'force for stability in the Balkans', as the only member of
Nato and the European Union in the region.
Its businessmen, finding it increasingly hard to compete in the single
market, see Albania, Bulgaria and Romania as a natural area for investment.
Trade already flourishes and co-operation is beginning in banking and
financial services.
Yet politicians and businessmen dismiss the idea of developing similar ties
with Macedonia, which they insist on calling Skopje, after its capital.
The Greek socialist government's decision on Wednesday to close the Greek
consulate in Skopje and deny the former Yugoslav republic access to the
northern Greek port of the Thessaloniki underlines the frailty of Greece's
European commitment when it comes to a bilateral dispute with a Balkan
neighbour.
'Macedonia's position is already precarious, despite widespread recognition
and support from the EU. This kind of pressure from the Greeks could be
dangerously destabilising,' said a diplomat.
Greece's refusal for the past two years to recognise Macedonia, on the
grounds that its name amounts to a territorial claim on the Greek province
of Macedonia, has consistently irritated its EU partners.
A widespread Greek belief that Greek and western European interests in the
Balkans do not necessarily coincide is voiced publicly by nationalist
factions in both Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement and the opposition conservatives.
Greece's unwillingness, for example, to endorse its Nato allies' ultimatum
to the Bosnian Serbs, or participate in military action in Bosnia, reflects
the government's reluctance to endanger Greek relations with Serbia.
However, there appears to be no connection between Mr Papandreou's
unprecedented move against Macedonia and the build-up to the threatened Nato
air strikes.
Mr Papandreou, who has been trying to improve relations with the United
States since his return to power last autumn, found himself under attack
from his party's left wing when the US recognised Macedonia last week.
Apart from helping to reassert his grip on Pasok, Mr Papandreou's decision
appears a clumsy attempt to put pressure on Mr Kiro Gligorov, the moderate
Macedonian president, to yield to Greek demands set last year as a condition
for resuming UN-sponsored talks on the name issue.
The Greeks insisted that Macedonia should change its flag, which carries an
ancient Greek symbol associated with Alexander the Great, alter the preamble
to its constitution to avoid any hint of building a Greater Macedonia and
stop propaganda against Greece.
Mr Gligorov's position is that talks should be restarted without
pre-conditions, since Macedonia's nationalist party, VMRO, has enough votes
to block the two-thirds majority needed in parliament to change flag and
constitution.
Moreover, closing the Greek consulate in Skopje will have little effect, as
Macedonian passport holders are routinely denied visas to visit Greece.
It remains unclear exactly how the Greek government intends to enforce the
embargo on Macedonia's use of Thessaloniki port. Greek foreign ministry
officials, asked how they would ensure that goods continued to move between
Macedonia and other EU countries under single market rules, appeared at a
loss.
Officials in Skopje admit that losing access to Thessaloniki comes as a
damaging blow just as Macedonia starts an economic reform programme, to be
based on an IMF stand-by loan, which aims at reviving industry. Almost all
Macedonia's oil is shipped by rail or truck from Thessaloniki.
Despite the political hostility, the volume of goods from Macedonia
transiting through Thessaloniki has risen sharply since the war in Bosnia
blocked access to ports in Montenegro and Croatia.
Macedonia's only alternative outlets to the sea are through Albania or
Bulgaria, but there are no direct rail connections with either country and
both roads are narrow and heavily congested.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Aid workers 'at risk' in Bosnia air strikes: UNHCR officials
warn staff would be compromised as would a programme that keeps 4.2m people
alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 18 months more than 400 truck drivers have criss-crossed the
former Yugoslavia delivering 73,200 tons of food and clothing a month to
4.2m people under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
Each day, they receive reports from UNHCR offices scattered throughout
Bosnia and decide whether to set out or not. Sometimes the weather forces
them to abandon their run.
'When it snows, we cannot see the mines,' said Ms Sylvana Foa, the
spokesperson for the UNHCR in Geneva. For instance, last Tuesday a convoy
was due to travel to eastern Mostar in western Hercegovina which Croat
forces have bombarded for the past year. 'There were no deliveries going
into Mostar on Tuesday. The mines were covered by snow,' she said.
Other days, the drivers, who travel in convoys backed by UN armoured
personnel carriers, hear from the local UNHCR offices about road blocks,
intimidation, food stolen from depots, shots fired at the trucks, colleagues
being attacked, sometimes shot dead, and endless delays in obtaining or
extending papers required to pass through Serb- and Croat-held territories
across Bosnia.
As the deadline looms for the Nato ultimatum, under which Serb-held
positions around Sarajevo will be hit if all heavy weapons are not withdrawn
or placed under UN supervision, UNHCR officials are becoming anxious. If the
air strikes lead to any retaliation on the ground, which could seriously
disrupt the steady flow of food, clothing and medicines, more people will
die, they say.
'The point is that if the UN gives the go-ahead for air attacks, and the UN
will lose its impartiality. Aid workers will be at risk, since they are
working under the auspices of a UN agency,' a British military expert said.
The UNHCR has some contingency plans. 'The most inessential staff will be
withdrawn from the region,' said Ms Foa. 'We will try and keep the logistics
and radio staff on the ground. But we will have to take each day as it
comes,' she added.
But no one can predict how Serb local commanders will react if Nato strikes
the hills surrounding Sarajevo. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian
Serbs, is already distancing himself from taking responsibility in the event
any aid workers are attacked.
'I assure you, the aid will continue, and it will be allowed to continue.
But I cannot tell you what will happen if I do not have control on the local
level,' he said in Geneva last week.
'Much will depend on what kind of messages will come from the top Serbian
leadership,' a UNHCR official said.
General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, has
already suggested that the lives of foreigners will not be safe if air
strikes take place. In an interview in the Belgrade-based Interfju weekly
magazine, he said: 'We are openly telling everyone: In case of air strikes,
all foreigners who find themselves on our territory will become hostages,'
he said.
'Those include International Red Cross and (UN relief) workers, and sadly,
journalists too,' Gen Milovanovic was quoted as saying.
The aid, sometimes interpreted as serving as a pretext for maintaining the
arms embargo, or blocking any outside military intervention, is, however one
of the unacknowledged 'successes', despite the terror and violence in
Bosnia.
In that republic alone, more than 2.7m people are dependent on aid which is
distributed from seven centres throughout Bosnia, involving more than 600
UNHCR staff, and a further 1.8m throughout the other republics. Many will be
unable to return because entire villages and towns have been destroyed, or
'ethnically cleansed'.
'Sometimes people forget that the aid is keeping people alive,' said Ms Foa.
But she added that the monthly food requirement continued to fall short of
deliveries from donor countries. For instance, last December, the city of
northern Bosnian city of Banja Luka required 3,400 tons. Less than 2,700
tons was delivered. UNHCR officials reckon that Bosnia requires 46,413 tons
a month. The shortfall already exceeds 15,000 tons.
Any slowdown, or disruption of the aid would not only lead to a worsening
refugee crisis, UNHCR officials warned this week. 'Europe will be saddled
with a refugee problem for a very long time,' said Ms Foa.
It would also facilitate 'ethnic cleansing'. Civilians would lose the will
to remain in villages cut off by food and this would facilitate 'ethnic
cleansing' and consolidate territorial gains by all sides, they warned.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Crimean tilt towards Russia stokes chances of conflict with
Ukraine

<TEXT>
Crimea's moves this week to appoint a Russian citizen as prime minister and
introduce the Russian rouble by summer are raising the likelihood of
conflict with the Ukrainian government in Kiev.
Ukrainian leaders have denounced the pro-Russian actions by the separatist
Black Sea peninsula, saying that they could cause 'a big political
upheaval'. But they have so far stopped short of threatening retaliation.
Since winning a landslide victory last month, Crimea's first president, Mr
Yuri Meshkov, has been fulfilling his campaign promise to reintegrate the
region into the Russian economy and press ahead with a referendum next March
on independence.
Last week, Mr Meshkov was in Moscow to initiate negotiations on economic
co-operation with Russia. Russian regional affairs minister, Mr Sergei
Shakhrai, confirmed on Wednesday that an economic agreement had been
drafted.
In addition to Russian roubles, Mr Meshkov announced that Russia would
supply gas and oil to the energy-starved region where a third of its
enterprises have stopped operating and half are working at 50 per cent
capacity.
Russia is also reportedly providing Rbs50bn to resettle Crimean Tatars
returning to the region after Stalin's second world war deportations.
Moscow's more active involvement in Crimea's aspirations for independence
threatens to add to Ukrainian-Russian tensions, just as the two sides were
beginning to resolve their differences on nuclear arms and energy supplies.
And Crimea is already the centre of a Russian-Ukrainian dispute over the
Black Sea Fleet based there.
Mr Valery Shmarov, deputy prime minister, has condemned the Moscow-Crimea
talks, saying: 'The rouble will not appear again as legal tender on Ukraine
territory.'
President Leonid Kravchuk, for his part, is looking at whether it is
constitutional for a Russian citizen to hold a high regional post with
access to state secrets.
A holiday and retirement area for Kremlin elite, Crimea is 70 per cent
populated by ethnic Russians. The coastal region was arbitrarily transferred
by the Kremlin from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction in 1954. But since
becoming part of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Crimea's 2.5m residents
have seen their fortunes decline with the worsening Ukrainian economy.
In the face of calls for independence, Kiev has granted Crimea political
autonomy and free economic zone status.

The quantity of contraband cigarettes seized last year by Italian customs
almost doubled to 1,583 tons, Robert Graham writes from Rome. Customs
figures released yesterday show that illicit cigarette trading cost the
treasury lost income of L442bn, (Pounds 17bn), 80 per cent up on 1992.
Registered unemployment in the Netherlands rose broadly in the three months
ended January 31. There were an average 480,000 people looking for work in
the latest November-January reporting period, more than the 453,000 in the
three months ended December 31 and up 116,000 from the 364,000 a year ago.
The November-January jobless total was the highest since the 493,000 people
recorded in first quarter of 1988.
New orders to Swedish industries rose 2% in volume terms in December from
November on the back of strong export orders. Orders were 19% higher than in
December 1992.
French producer prices fell 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, in line with
the third quarter fall, but less than the 1.7 per cent fall in the fourth
quarter of 1992.
Poland had a current account deficit of Dollars 62m in December after a
surplus of Dollars 16m in the previous month. The total deficit for 1993 was
Dollars 2.3bn.
Hungary's merchandise trade deficit rose to Dollars 3.62bn in 1993 from
Dollars 356m in 1992. Imports include Dollars 713m of Russian warplanes as
part payment of trade debt.

The recession in Begium has bottomed out, although the economy remains

He said the budget deficit, currently 7.2 per cent, remained the central
issue facing the government. Belgium's GDP fell 1.3 per cent in 1993.
Household savings reached a record 20 per cent of disposable incomes. The
recession appeared to have slowed in the last quarter of 1993, but during
the year as a whole unemployment rose from 8.2 per cent to 9.4 per cent,
with no prospect of a fall in the jobless rate in sight. Inflation rose to
2.8 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent in 1992.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Safety fear over E Europe nuclear plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Europe's ageing nuclear reactors will present a serious hazard
unless more money is provided for their renovation and eastern European
governments agree to implement the Vienna convention on nuclear safety,
Foratom, the European nuclear industry body warned yesterday.
Speaking in Brussels, Dr Claus Berke, president of Foratom, said that in
spite of growing western concerns about the safety of the plants, in the
aftermath of the Chernobyl accident nearly eight years ago, attempts to
bring them into line with western safety standards were now almost entirely
blocked in Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus.
One reason for this is a lack of funds - although Foratom has calculated
that DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) would be needed to carry out the necessary safety
work, only Dollars 1.7bn of funds had been offered so far, the group said.
However, the most significant reason for the delay has been the refusal of
western companies to carry out the necessary replacement work, because of
the failure by the governments in Russia. Ukraine and Belarus to sign the
Vienna convention on nuclear safety.
This ensures that western companies carrying out renovation work on eastern
European nuclear plants will be not be liable for civil claims in the event
of a nuclear explosion.
'It is because of this risk (of being sued) that western industry has become
increasingly reluctant to continue working in those states which have not
signed and implemented the Vienna convention,' said Mr Jonathan Heller, of
the Foratom secretariat.
He pointed out that so far virtually no replacement work had been carried
out in any of the nuclear plants in Russia or the Ukraine, although
companies had been allowed to proceed with analysis.
The Ukraine has five nuclear power plants, including the infamous Chernobyl
plant. Russia has nine, with the plant in St Petersburg - of a similar
design to Chenobyl - suppying 40 per cent of the city's electricity.
Foratom said yesterday that efforts were now being made to develop interim
commitments with the separate states which would allow western companies to
evade liability.
The Lithuanian government recently amended its laws to allow ABB group to
renovate the Ignalina plant in Lithuania, and Foratom hopes that other
groups like Siemens will also be able to benefit from similar agreements.
Faced with a declining market in western Europe, eastern Europe is regarded
as a rich source of potential business for the European and US nuclear
industry.
However, Foratom admitted that the uncertain outcome of the Russian
elections was now making it increasingly difficult for them to persuade the
Russian government to take similar action.
'It is not very high on the Russian government's agenda,' said Mr Heller,
who added that even if the delay was resolved it would take some three to
four years before eastern European nuclear plants were brought into line
with western safety standards.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three regions of Germany's IG Metall engineering workers' union yesterday
decided their annual wage negotiations have formally failed, clearing the
way for the union leadership to call a strike ballot.
The move coincided with a renewed outbreak of token strikes in support of
the union's claim for a pay rise of 5.5 to 6 per cent and guarantees of job
security.
In spite of a renewed plea by Chancellor Helmut Kohl for both employers and
the trade union in the vital engineering industry to 'exhaust every possible
opportunity to reach an agreement, right up to the last minute,' the rest of
IG Metall's 14 regional wage commissions are expected to declare their
negoti - ations deadlocked today.
The union leadership is expected to decide next Monday on the region where a
strike ballot will be held, probably between March 1 and 3, with a view to
calling a localised strike from March 7.
A move from the employers' side to restrict the talks just to questions of
pay and holiday bonuses, and avoid the contentious area of working hours,
was rejected by the union, leaving the two sides still apparently
deadlocked.
Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, says the next move is
now up to the trade union. Mr Dieter Kirchner, the chief executive of the
organisation, warned in an interview to be published today that a strike
decision would lead to lock-outs. They would be used as a last resort, in
order to shorten any strike.
The union must get 75 per cent support in any ballot to call a strike, and
it is clear public opinion is hostile to any such action. An opinion poll in
Stern magazine today says 67 per cent of the west German population would
oppose it.
Yesterday's protest actions included a stoppage by 20,000 workers who
attended a rally outside the Mercedes works at Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart.
Token strikes have been organised across the country, since the legal
requirement to observe industrial peace expired on January 28.
The first round of pay talks for the construction industry was held in
Frankfurt yesterday, without any outcome.
The construction union, IG Bau, is looking for a 6 per cent pay increase.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Bavarian minister out but not down: Rivals compete to
inherit the conservative mantle of Franz-Josef Strauss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bavaria is bracing itself for a new battle between its conservative leaders
over who can most rightfully claim to inherit the mantle of Mr Franz-Josef
Strauss, its legendary post-war leader.
The stage-managed resignation on Wednesday night of Mr Peter Gauweiler, the
44-year-old environment minister in Germany's prosperous and fiercely
independent southern state, could set the scene for a continuing struggle
for the soul of Mr Strauss' ruling Christian Social Union, the smallest
partner in the Bonn coalition.
Mr Gauweiler, forced out of office in a scandal over legal fees, which he
has continued to receive in addition to his ministerial income, managed to
dominate prime time national television with his resignation speech to a
cheering audience of supporters in a Munich beer cellar.
A former student leader who was rapidly promoted by Mr Strauss when he was
Bavarian prime minister, Mr Gauweiler told a delighted crowd that he would
be back. 'I feel stronger and fitter than many people would like me to be,'
he declared.
His departure is both a relief and a worry to Mr Edmund Stoiber, the current
Bavarian premier, and the principal claimant to inherit the Strauss mantle.
Mr Stoiber, who defeated CSU leader, Mr Theo Waigel, Bonn finance minister,
to assume the premiership last year, and thus underline his claim to be the
party's real strongman, is fighting to defend an absolute majority in
Bavaria's state parliament at elections scheduled for September.
At the same time the CSU is struggling to maintain its presence in the
European parliament at the European elections on June 12: it has to win
enough support in Bavaria alone to gain 5 per cent of the national vote  -
the minimum needed to gain seats in the parliament.
Initial fears that Mr Gauweiler, an outspoken Euro-sceptic would leave the
party and campaign against it, are discounted by most Bavarian observers.
'He will certainly stay in the party,' Mr Michael Stiller, domestic
political editor of the Suddeutsche newspaper in Munich, said yesterday. 'He
hesitated for a long time, and there was talk of him teaming up with the
anti-European alliance headed by Manfred Brunner (the Free Citizens'
Alliance).
'He is a very good beer-tent speaker. I think he will now go out and
campaign for re-election in the CSU, arguing that some people should be
re-elected more than others.
'The danger for Stoiber is that Gauweiler is trying to revive the old
Strauss era. Stoiber is trying to distance himself from it, to the extent
that the memory is tainted with the suspicion of bribery and corruption.'
Both men share a common Euro-scepticism, which the CSU is seeking to exploit
to keep the far-right wing Republicans at bay in the forthcoming European
elections. In that campaign, Mr Gauweiler, who coined the phrase 'Esperanto
money' to describe the future common European currency, is needed as a vital
ally.
Whether he can use his obvious popularity with the party's conservative
grass roots to challenge Mr Stoiber himself is more doubtful. But his
presence does mean that the Bavarian premier is likely to spend the next
seven months watching his back, as well as his more obvious opponents.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Bundesbank takes a gamble with the D-Mark: Conservative
bankers say the interest rate cut presents a risk to the exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's snip at the discount lending rate yesterday appeared to be
something of a gamble for an institution apparently so concerned with the
stability of the D-Mark. As the more conservative among banking and
industrial associations warned, the cut of 50 basis points to 5.25 per cent
was not without its risks to exchange rates.
Many observers had also previously written off any change this week on the
basis of Bundesbankers' repeated insistence on controlling growth in the M3
measure of money supply - the central bank's most-trusted barometer of
future inflation.
In the light of the latest figures, which showed 8.1 per cent annualised M3
growth in December and an expansion rate in the last quarter of 1993 almost
one percentage point above the upper 6.5 per cent limit of the central
bank's target range, there seemed little prospect of a cut, however much
economists and industrialists felt it was overdue.
A further element of risk was the danger of appearing relaxed about the
overall situation and thereby sending the wrong signals to the truculent IG
Metall engineering union which is currently preparing to call a strike
ballot in pursuit of its 1994 wage claim.
But in the event, and in the light of encouraging noises on pay, public
deficits, money supply and inflation emerging recently from the bank's
headquarters, the central council decided that it could justify a resumption
of the tip-toe progression which has characterised its policy since the
discount rate started downwards from its 8.75 per cent peak almost 18 months
ago.
The scale of yesterday's reduction of 50 basis points was wholly in keeping
with the ultra-cautious process in which the bank has made nine cuts since
September 1992 to shave just 3.5 percentage points off the discount rate.
The progression has run roughly in parallel with a series of economic and
monetary developments, which - despite some hiccups - appear closely to
match the Bundesbank's stringent requirements.
As it pointed out in its latest monthly report, published earlier this week,
seasonally adjusted consumer prices have been rising for the six months to
the end of January at just 2.5 per cent, compared with the 2 per cent the
bank regards as acceptable.
Despite a tax and levy-induced month-on-month surge of 0.9 per cent last
month, the headline annual rate of inflation was 3.5 per cent, continuing
the uninterrupted erosion of inflation which has now been under way for more
than a year.
Federal and regional government paymasters have also clearly taken
Bundesbank strictures to heart. As the bank's monthly report noted,
underlying federal spending last year increased just 2 per cent after
exclusion of the burdensome effects of recession and unification, while the
average inflation rate was 4 per cent.
Meanwhile, wage settlements so far have been far below the expected rate of
inflation for 1994, and the external value of the D-Mark has been 'fully
corrected', according to the bank, after its marked appreciation following
last summer's widening of the fluctuation bands within the European monetary
systems. With key indicators apparently moving in the right direction, and
the D-Mark back where it belongs in the currency constellations, the bank
clearly felt itself able to take a modest gamble on its belief, restated
yesterday, that the recent ballooning in M3 is a 'temporary disturbance'.
One side effect of the move, which the introspective central bank
customarily insists plays a less than central role in its considerations, is
expected to be a further stimulus to economic recovery outside Germany.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria all responded promptly with rate cuts
of their own yesterday.
By the bank's own reckoning, the domestic economy is still not free of
recession. By the reckonings of German industrialists, since domestic demand
among private, industrial and public sector consumers will remain weak for
the foreseeable future, the only reliable route from the bottom of the
economic cycle lies via improvements in export markets.
Any actions which serve to increase confidence abroad will directly benefit
the internal situation, but as the Bundesbank tirelessly repeats, its job is
managing monetary policy, and it can do that effectively only if the
conditions outside its Frankfurt headquarters are right.
It made its move yesterday in the full knowledge that total public sector
debt will approach DM2,000bn this year: equivalent to 60 per cent of gross
domestic product. With protest strikes continuing around the engineering
industry, it needed no reminders that the 1994 pay round is far from
complete.
Signs of budgetary relaxation - a particular risk in an election year - or
of inflationary pay awards to metal workers or public sector employees are
likely to lead to the bank's retiring once more into its shell. And if it is
wrong in its belief that money supply growth will fall this spring back
towards or to within its target range, it may well stay there for some time
to come.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Moscow to accept all drugs approved and made in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's health ministry has agreed to accept all drugs approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration and manufactured in the US without additional
clinical testing or analysis.
The move is expected to open the door to the Russian market for
pharmaceutical companies that have often found Russian authorisation for
their products long, costly and unpredictable.
Despite the requirement that the drugs be made in the US - intended to
insure that the production facilities are under FDA supervision - the
agreement is unlikely to yield an immediate financial bonanza for
pharmaceutical manufacturers, because of Russia's economic problems.
It will, however, greatly improve access to some of the most important
medicaments for Russian patients.
Many drugs are scarce and unaffordable, contributing to severe outbreaks of
diseases such as diphtheria. Modern antibiotics are in particularly short
supply, with shortages exacerbated by the need to pay in hard currency for
medicines previously supplied by eastern European allies.
Only around 40 US drugs are currently approved for sale in Russia. Winning
that approval could take more than a year, and much longer if the Russian
health ministry decided to order its own clinical trials.
Although the US-Russian agreement works only one way, it may offer a glimpse
of greater future co-operation between government drug agencies in different
countries.
US manufacturers will receive approval for their products within 90 days of
submitting basic documentation.
The US, EU and Japan agreed in 1991 on guidelines aimed at harmonising their
drug approval procedures, so that companies could conduct a single set of
clinical trials that could be used in winning authorisation in each country.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Financial markets welcome move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision yesterday by the Bundesbank to cut its discount rate by half a
percentage point was welcomed in financial markets as confirmation that
European interest rates are on a downward trend.
Analysts cautioned, however, that it was unlikely all European countries
would follow suit until there was a clearer sign from Germany. The
Bundesbank's move was described as 'very cautious' and other countries are
expected to be equally careful.
The Dutch and Belgian central banks quickly followed the German lead, but
analysts stressed that although the Bundesbank's move signalled an easing of
monetary policy, its cut yesterday was confined to the discount rate. Both
the repo and Lombard rates were left unchanged.
'The Bundesbank is creating room for a real cut in their effective monetary
instrument, the repo rate,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ
International.
'The good news is that they have unlocked that door, but they have not yet
opened it.'
The repo is the rate that sets the money market rate and it is the key
instrument used by the Bundesbank for implementing monetary policy.
The discount rate, which was cut to 5.25 per cent, establishes a floor for
German interest rates. For money market rates to move lower, however, would
require a lowering of the repo rate, which was yesterday left at 6 per cent.
The Lombard rate, the upper ceiling at which the Bundesbank offers liquidity
to the system, was also unchanged at 6.75 per cent.
Belgium cut its equivalent of the repo rate by only 15 basis points, while
the Dutch left their repo equivalent - the special advances rate  -
unchanged, while trimming two other rates. Austria, which is not a member of
the ERM, cut its discount and Lombard rates by a quarter percentage point.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, welcomed the
Bundesbank rate cut as 'a timely move that has given a much better tone to
European bond markets,' but said there would be 'few immediate changes' in
European interest rates.
Mr Chertkow said the 'hard core' ERM currencies would probably await a
Bundesbank decision on its repo rate. But if a currency such as the French
franc were to appreciate to FFr3.38 to the D-mark, the central bank may be
tempted to cut rates independently of the Bundesbank.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said
the Bundesbank wanted to reassure markets that it had not departed from its
long-term path of lower rates, despite concerns over the IG Metall wage
dispute and expectation of poor January money supply figures.
There has recently been evidence of investors in German bond markets
becoming disenchanted at Germany's failure to ease policy more quickly. If
this were to translate into large-scale selling, this would drive up
long-term interest rates. Mr Chertkow said yesterday's move had probably
averted this scenario.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Germany cuts key lending rate: Surprise move raises hopes
for wider easing of monetary policy in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank unexpectedly cut its key discount lending rate yesterday by
half a percentage point to 5.25 per cent, raising hopes of more speedy
reductions in future.
Resuming its cautious monetary relaxation programme after a pause of almost
four months, the German central bank said it had taken into account the
continuing fall in inflation which had further strengthened trust in the
stability of the D-Mark.
The decision was greeted with initial enthusiasm by European currency
markets but the euphoria cooled. The D-Mark weakened across the board, but
regained much of its losses in New York. Sterling rose nearly a pfennig to
close at DM2.5559 in London, but lost most of its gains in US trade. The
D-Mark was at FFr3.399 in late New York trade from FFr3.407 in London on
Wednesday. It fell marginally against the dollar.
Money market analysts said the move had improved the prospects for an easing
of monetary policy elsewhere in Europe, but the rate of change would
initially be slow. The German cuts were quickly followed by rate cuts in
Belgium, Austria and Italy. The Netherlands also altered two rates and Spain
may follow suit.
In a brief statement, the Bundesbank shrugged off recent explosive growth in
money supply, saying its monetary policy was based on annual targets and
that 'temporary disturbances had to be accepted'.
Its decision also appeared to discount any danger of employers offering
inflationary pay awards as a way of avoiding or ending national strikes
threatened in the engineering sector.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, defended the
softly-softly approach. The bank had to take care that its decisions did not
have undesirable effects on long-term interest rates, he said. Up to 80 per
cent of German industrial investment is financed with long-term loans.
Yesterday's meeting of the central bank council left the lombard rate, the
effective ceiling rate, unchanged at 6.75 per cent. The securities
repurchase rate, at which the bank supplies short-term liquidity to the
market, and which the Bundesbank considers its most important instrument,
was also left unchanged at 6 per cent for next week's tender.
The repo rate, at which German financial institutions borrow some two-thirds
of their short-term funds, has remained unchanged since early December.
Mr Otmar Issing, the central bank's chief economist, dismissed as malicious
and false suggestions that Bundesbank policy had softened under Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the new president. The decision was the 'right mixture', he said,
demonstrating the bank's ability to act while allowing caution to prevail.
Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in
Frankfurt, said: 'As usual, they have made it seem a bit grudging. 'But the
main thing is that rate cuts are back on the agenda.'
The VoB association of public sector banks said the 'brave' move was not
without risks for the D-Mark exchange rate, but that it was a step in the
right direction, considering the unsatisfactory state of the economy.
However, observers said they expected further cautious reductions in the
repo rate as preparation for more moves on the discount rate, the effective
'floor' lending level.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Biggest US cable TV group acquires 20% stake in HTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TCI of Denver, the world's largest cable television company, moved into the
British broadcasting industry yesterday by buying a significant stake in
HTV, the ITV broadcaster for Wales and the west of England.
The deal marks a significant stage in the current round of agreed and
hostile takeover bids in ITV as it involves for the first time a foreign
controlled, non-ITV company. It is the first attempt in the UK to bring
together a traditional television broadcaster with an emerging cable
television operator.
Flextech, the fast-growing media group controlled by TCI, is buying a 20 per
cent share in HTV for about Pounds 27m. A former oil services company that
turned itself into a media group, Flextech owns, manages or has stakes in 11
satellite and cable television channels in the UK and Europe. They include
five channels in the Sky Television multi-channels package.
The alliance with HTV, which Flextech is funding through a placing of 6.59m
new shares, would extend its reach into terrestrial broadcasting.
Mr Roger Luard, Flextech's managing director, said the two companies would
jointly exploit opportunities to use production facilities and broaden the
reach of programmes.
The deal effectively removes HTV from the list of takeover targets within
the ITV sector. It means that of the large or medium-sized ITV companies
only Scottish Television and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees are not subject to bids.
Granada's bid for LWT is due to come to a head next Friday, the final date
for acceptance of Granada's Pounds 776m latest offer.
At the same time as outlining the Flextech deal, HTV announced a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 3.3m for 1993 compared with a loss of Pounds 20.5m in 1992.
Earnings per share rose to 4.8p compared with a loss of 29.5p a share in
1992. After passing the interim dividend, the company plans a 1p final
dividend.
'The last 12 months have seen a return to solid profitability,' said Mr
Louis Sherwood, HTV chairman.
The Flextech deal is the equivalent of 156p a share, representing a 25 per
cent premium over HTV's closing price on February 16 and 32.5 times HTV's
1993 earnings. The HTV share price yesterday rose 27p to 152p and Flextech
rose 8p to 444p.

Rival US skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding were together on the ice
for the first time since Kerrigan (pictured in white) was hit on the knee by
a man hired by Harding's ex-husband. The skaters were practising in Norway
in preparation for the Winter Olympics. The attack, in January, was
purportedly aimed at injuring Kerrigan so she would not be able to compete
in the event, and Harding is under investigation for her alleged role. She
has denied planning the assault but admitted not going to the authorities
after learning about the plot.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Government lawyers doctored documents, Scott told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government lawyers doctored official papers in an attempt to stop the
Matrix-Churchill trial judge seeing confidential Whitehall documents crucial
to the acquittal of three businessmen charged with breaching rules over
exports to Iraq, the Scott inquiry was told yesterday.
Mr Andrew Leithead, an assistant Treasury solicitor, admitted that
government lawyers, as well as ministers, were involved in attempts to
suppress highly sensitive information about sales of arms-making equipment
to Iraq.
His evidence is the first to show the extent of government lawyers'
involvement in the alleged cover-up of the relaxation of the guidelines for
exporting such equipment.
Mr Leithead made the admission under questioning over the government's
controversial use of public interest immunity (PII) certificates to suppress
official information.
Challenged over the general policy for seeking PII certificates in criminal
trials, Mr Leithead said the government took a 'generous view' of what
should be suppressed.
The government's view was that high and middle order information should not
be disclosed as a matter of policy.
'It is damaging to the public interest to have any part of the
decision-making process made public,' he said.
The documents in question recorded ministers' decision to relax the
guidelines. Before the trial in October 1992, the judge rejected calls from
government lawyers for PII certificates to be granted to prevent the
disclosure of the documents in the trial.
Mr Leithead agreed with Lord Justice Scott that at a meeting between himself
and Customs prosecutors it was agreed to alter documentation relating to the
certificates. This was a tactic to prevent the judge asking to see the
documents in the first place - before deciding whether they should be
suppressed.
Asked if this was legitimate, Mr Leithead said he had not been happy, but
the decision had been taken by Mr Alan Moses QC, the barrister prosecuting
for Customs.
Mr Leithead said ministers had no discretion whether or not to sign PII
certificates. It was not their function to decide whether disclosure of
documents would damage the public interest. The accepted practice was to
leave this to trial judges.
Mr Leithead was also challenged why he and other officials had rewritten a
witness statement by Mr Anthony Steadman, a former DTI export licensing
head. 'It would be wrong to put words into his mouth if they were not
correct, but where you have a civil servant giving evidence on behalf of a
department, many hands contribute,' he said.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Bosnian Serbs begin pull-back from Sarajevo: Russians secure
agreement from Karadzic that ceasefire will be observed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serbs began a large-scale withdrawal of their heavy weapons from
around Sarajevo yesterday, after dramatic intervention by Russia to avert
Nato air strikes against the Serbs.
Moscow secured a pull-back agreement with an assurance that it would send in
800 Russian troops to join the United Nations peacekeeping force in and
around the Bosnian capital. Most western countries, meanwhile, refused to
send additional troops to bolster the UN operation.
'We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over,' Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, said after meeting Russian envoy Mr Vitaly Churkin at
Pale, northeast of Sarajevo.
A UN official said a 'very significant' withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces
was taking place. 'We are talking about convoys of equipment moving off the
hills.'
In Brussels, Nato said it stood by its ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to
withdraw heavy weapons more than 20km from the centre of Sarajevo or put
them under UN control under pain of air strikes. Pressure would not be
lifted until Nato was sure the Serbs had complied.
In Washington, the White House welcomed the Serb promise to Moscow but
expressed surprise that the Russians were sending UN peacekeepers to
Sarajevo.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, welcomed the Russian initiative,
adding: 'There is now a much better chance than before of avoiding air
strikes.'
Russia's decision to send more troops to Sarajevo arose directly from
discussions between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and President Yeltsin
in Moscow, Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, told the
Commons last night.
Mr Churkin said 400 Russian troops under UN command in Croatia would be sent
immediately to the Sarajevo area and 400 more would be sent from Russia.
Mr Churkin went to Pale after two days of talks with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia to try to defuse the Bosnian crisis.
The Russian leadership is anxious not to be sidelined as Nato and Washington
assume a stronger role in Bosnia. It also has to take account of nationalist
feeling at home sympathetic to the Serbs. In an interview on Russian
television, Mr Churkin said: 'We can say that any air strikes on any Bosnian
Serb positions are ruled out for the simple reason there will be no targets
for these strikes to hit.'
Mr Karadzic said: 'We are very grateful to Russia for its involvement in the
resolution of the crisis.' The Bosnian Serbs had accepted the Russian
'request' that they withdraw heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo and observe
a ceasefire.
Defence ministers from several Nato countries will meet in Italy on Sunday,
just hours before the expiry of the Nato deadline. If withdrawal and
collection of heavy weapons is not completed by that time, UN commanders on
the ground can ask Nato to carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions.
In London, after a tense cabinet meeting at which several senior government
members warned against deeper British involvement in former Yugoslavia, Mr
Major announced that two companies of soldiers - about 300 in all - would be
redeployed from central Bosnia to Sarajevo.
Britain is also to send 60 troops with radar equipment to locate heavy
weaponry sited around the Bosnian capital, as well as up to 100 further
personnel.
In an implicit sideswipe against the US, which has no ground troops based in
former Yugoslavia, British ministers suggested that western nations which
have yet to contribute to the UN forces in Bosnia should meet the call from
General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, for an extra 3,000 troops.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Bosnian Serbs 'to pull back all heavy weapons': Russians
receive pledge from Karadzic that ceasefire will be observed

<TEXT>
Russia yesterday seized the initiative in the Bosnian crisis, apparently
winning the Bosnian Serbs' agreement to pull back all their heavy weapons
from around Sarajevo.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, said that 400 Russian
peacekeeping troops would be sent immediately from Croatia to the Bosnian
capital, and 400 more would be dispatched from Russia itself. This followed
assurances given to Mr Churkin by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian
Serbs, that he would abide by the ceasefire and withdraw the heavy
artillery.
Mr Karadzic declared after meeting Mr Churkin in Pale, the Bosnian Serb
headquarters: 'We are going towards the end of the war, at least in Sarajevo
and that might be the introduction of the end of the war in all
Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
Mr Bill Aikman, spokesman for the United Nations forces in Sarajevo,
described the promised withdrawal as 'a very heartening development'.
Although many previous pledges by the Bosnian Serbs have come to nothing, Mr
Aikman later spoke of 'a very significant withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces
off the hills around Sarajevo' taking place last night. 'We are talking
about convoys of equipment moving off the hills,' he added.
Most western countries yesterday refused to send substantial additional
troops to bolster the UN operation in Sarajevo.
The Russian leadership is anxious not to be sidelined as Nato and Washington
assume a higher profile in the Bosnian crisis. It is also obliged to take
into account its nationalist constituency at home, which sympathises with
the Serbs.
In an interview on Russian television, Mr Churkin said: 'We can say that any
air strikes on any Bosnian Serb positions are ruled out for the simple
reason there will be no targets for these strikes to hit.'
Mr Karadzic said: 'We are very grateful to Russia for its involvement in the
resolution of the crisis. We have accepted the proposal and the request by
Russia concerning the withdrawal of heavy weaponry.'
Admiral Mike Boorda, commander of Nato's southern forces, had said earlier
in the day: 'We are a long way from complete compliance.' Defence ministers
from several Nato countries will meet in Italy on Sunday, hours before the
expiry at midnight GMT of a Nato ultimatum. If the withdrawal and collection
of heavy weapons is not completed by that time, the UN commanders on the
ground can ask Nato to carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions.
In London, the British government rejected sending more troops to former
Yugoslavia to reinforce the peacekeeping operation around Sarajevo.
In an implicit sideswipe against the US, which has no ground troops based in
former Yugoslavia, British ministers suggested that western nations which
have yet to contribute to the UN forces in Bosnia should meet the call from
General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, for an extra 3,000 troops.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Lower lira set to boost Merloni
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merloni, the Italian white goods group, expects pre-tax profits to recover
to about L45bn (Dollars 27m) for 1993 against L4.8bn the previous year.
The improvement stems from higher margins because of the lower lira and the
one-off effect in 1992 of a L24bn foreign exchange loss. Net group earnings
in 1992 were only L1.6bn.
Mr Vittorio Merloni, chairman, said that last year's sales soared by 30 per
cent to more than L1,700bn, thanks to the first-time consolidation of Pekel,
the Turkish white goods group 54 per cent owned by Merloni. Stripped of the
acquisition, the increase would have been about 15 per cent, he said.
Merloni had raised its share of the European white goods market by about 1
percentage point, to more than 9 per cent, behind Electrolux, Bosch-Siemens
and Whirlpool, he said.
Mr Merloni, who hopes to reach a 10 per cent market share, did not exclude
further acquisitions, particularly now the group's net financial
indebtedness was under control. Merloni's net indebtedness actually rose to
L230bn last year from L206bn in 1992. However, that was swelled by the Pekel
takeover, without which the total would have been about L185bn. Following
the advance repayment of a L100bn convertible bond, announced yesterday, net
debt was now about L180bn.
The lower lira should have boosted margins by about L80bn last year, said Mr
Merloni. However, about half the competitive edge gained had been used to
maintain or even reduce prices. Of the remaining L40bn, around half had been
used for extra promotion or restructuring, while only the remaining L20bn
had fed through to the bottom line, he said.

profit by 24%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, shrugged off the effects of
recession to achieve net profits of FFr3.1bn (Dollars 526m) last year, an
increase of 24 per cent over 1992.
The results exclude a payment to the state, which is part of a four-year
agreement, and which is estimated at about FFr1bn for last year. Sales rose
by 3.5 per cent to FFr183.6bn, with a strong increase in exports of
electricity.
Mr Gilles Menage, chairman of EdF, said he expected only a slight increase
in electricity rates this year, of the order of 0.5 per cent, below an
expected inflation rate of just over 2 per cent. He described the limited
increase which has to be confirmed by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, as 'good news for the French consumer'.
Investments were held constant at FFr32.9bn, but the company's cashflow
strengthened and borrowings were reduced from FFr194.8bn to FFr176.5bn.
Interest costs represented about 9.5 per cent of turnover, according to EdF.

Sch3bn

<TEXT>
Mayr-Melnhof (MM), a family owned Austrian company and one of Europe's
leading carton and packaging companies, plans to raise about Sch3bn (Dollars
250m) through a share issue early in the spring, Mr Michael Groller, chief
board executive, said yesterday.
The Mayr-Melnhof family will keep a two-thirds stake after the flotation
which is expected to take place in April with Morgan Stanley as
international lead managers and Creditanstalt Bankverein, the Austrian bank,
as domestic managers. The shares will be offered to investors in western
Europe and the US, and will be listed on the Vienna Borse.
The proceeds will finance acquisitions in Europe. 'The industry is going
through a process of concentration. We have two options. We can either be a
local niche producer or build up our strength in Europe,' said Mr Alfred
Fogarassy, board member.
Past acquisitions financed from own resources included the purchase in 1992
of Deeside Paperbox in Manchester, UK, and a 50 per cent stake in CP Schmidt
Verpackungswerk of Germany. In addition to plants in Germany, the UK and
Austria, MM also has subsidiaries in Switzerland, France, Italy and the
Netherlands.
MM's activities in eastern Europe are expected to grow as part of its
strategy to supply multinational companies moving into new post-communist
markets. MM has a plant in Hungary, and projects are planned for Poland and
the Czech Republic.
MM was founded 100 years ago, and is one of the world's leading cardboard
manufacturers, producing carton board, folding cartons, and recycling waste
paper. In 1992, it produced about 1m tonnes of carton board, giving it a 20
per cent share of the European market. Production of folding carton used
primarily for packaging food, beverages, and other products such as washing
powders, was about 100,000 tonnes.

<TEXT>
The privatisation of KPN, the Dutch state-owned telecommunications and
postal company, is provisionally scheduled to take place in early June, with
June 7 the most likely date for the opening of subscriptions to investors.
The date is contained in a provisional timetable drawn up by the banking
syndicate, led by ABN Amro, after consultations with the government. The
actual date may be moved depending on the progress made in preparing for the
flotation, which will rank as the largest in the history of the Amsterdam
stock exchange.
The finance ministry declined to comment on the date, noting only that the
government has said in the past that the shares would be sold before the end
of June if stock market conditions permit.
The Dutch state is expected to sell a 30 per cent stake in KPN when the
first tranche of shares, worth an estimated Fl 5bn (Dollars 2.6bn), is
offered to investors in June. Subsequent tranches in the late 1990s will
reduce the government's holding to less than 50 per cent.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Ukraine shies from continuing squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ukrainian government is coming close to abandoning a tight three-month
credit squeeze and is slowly bending to political pressure to issue a flood
of new credits worth nearly 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic
product.
Not even the presence in Kiev this week of an International Monetary Fund
team, offering a Dollars 700m (Pounds 474m) loan in support of tighter
monetary policies, appears to have softened demands for new growth in the
money supply.
So far, the credit squeeze has been left to function without any
accompanying fiscal support. 'Strict monetary policy without reform is
empty,' Mr Victor Yushchenko, national bank chairman, told the FT. 'It's
plain cruelty when someone hasn't received his salary in five months. The
only way is to issue new money.'
Eighty days ago Ukraine began its first crude attempt to combat
hyperinflation by a sudden clampdown on the money supply. Annual inflation
was over 9,000 per cent in 1993. In December, with the squeeze in effect,
inflation slowed to 190 per cent.
However, the squeeze hit all enterprises, solvent and failing. Many workers
have not been paid. Others have been sent home on unpaid leave and
enterprises have been unable to pay bills.
But after this brief adventure with a tough anti-inflationary policy, the
government is on the retreat. Mr Leonid Kuchma, former prime minister and an
active campaigner in next month's parliamentary elections, has reportedly
vowed to bring the government down if credits are not released to
enterprises.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Miners lead strike wave in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A series of strikes and strike threats are now rippling across Russia,
evidence of a growing militancy in face of non-payment of wages, reductions
in workforces and plunging morale as workers in different industries face
increasingly uncertain futures.
The coalminers, traditionally the most militant group in Russia as
elsewhere, have staged stoppages in the Arctic region of Vorkuta and in the
larger Kuzbass coal basin. However, a wider strike expected to be called on
Tuesday has been delayed, as divisions emerged on the council of the
Independent Miners' Union about how far political demands should be
advanced.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, promised the Kuzbass men on
Tuesday to pay Rbs1,500bn in back wages in order to avert action in the
basin.
More seriously for the government, oil workers in the city of
Nizhnevartovsk, the centre of the Tyumen oil-producing region, have voted
for a strike which will be called by a strike committee 'if the situation
requires'. The oil workers claim they have not been paid their salaries, of
around Rbs500,000 a month, for three months.
Thousands of teachers at institutes of higher education struck yesterday,
also protesting against non-payment of wages and citing rapidly worsening
conditions in the colleges. They demanded payment in full of all wages and
that the government fulfil its promises to index the low pay rates to
inflation.
In Moscow, the city's ambulance service workers, who include doctors in
their ranks, have decided to strike from March 1 - but in a 'special form'
which will include not carrying corpses (except those of children) and not
filling in forms, but will not include refusing to take emergencies and the
aged to hospital.
An earlier call for a full strike, made by the work force council of the
ambulance agency, was overturned by a meeting of the service's workers
yesterday. Mr Anatoly Solovyov,head of the service, said that many,
especially the elderly, 'would experience a moral, if not physical, trauma
if they hear of an all-out strike'.
Strikes have been rare in spite of - or because of - the steadily worsening
living standards and the now habitual inability of enterprises to pay their
workers. However, the example of the miners, who have usually won promises
(if not always the actuality) of extra payments whenever they have
threatened strike, the practise seems to be spreading.

FT  17 FEB 94 / BMW expects to regain ground

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, the German carmaker, expects to boost its profits by 20-30 per cent
this year, recovering much of the ground lost in 1993 when net profits
slumped to about DM510m.
The company, which plans to take control of Rover Group, yesterday forecast
a 5 per cent increase in deliveries of BMW models, and said income from the
British business could increase earnings even further.
The buoyant predictions came as teams from BMW and Rover Group were
understood to be preparing to fly to Tokyo for talks early next week with
Rover's long-standing partner, Honda, on BMW's intended acquisition. The
teams are expected to be led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, and
Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive.
Honda has a 20 per cent stake in Rover and has made plain its anger and
dismay over the Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn) sale to BMW by British Aerospace
of its 80 per cent stake in Rover. The Japanese carmaker has indicated that
its quarrel is not with Rover or BMW but with BAe.
Both European parties hope to persuade Honda not to withdraw from its
collaboration with Rover and point to benefits in long-term tripartite
co-operation.
Earlier this week Mr Pischetsrieder promised 'considerably higher'
investment in Rover than had been planned by BAe. Yesterday, he vigorously
denied rumours that BMW planned to reduce the Rover product range. He also
repeated pledges that the British business would be run as an independent
operation, adding that aggregate sales of DM40bn (Dollars 22.7bn) and the
expected profits would offer job security at both companies.
Mr Pischetsrieder based his optimism for 1994 profits on new models due on
the market this year, economic recovery in Europe and accelerating demand in
the US. A compact, two-door version of the successful 3-Series, launched
this week, was expected to bolster turnover. Further impetus would come from
the new 7-Series.
He said the greatest uncertainty stemmed from unforeseeable exchange rate
variations, but the board was 'well satisfied' with the situation.

FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debate over whether or not the US is selling down its holding of British
Petroleum continued to overhang the UK traded shares. BP failed to benefit
from the general gains within the market and closed marginally lower at
366p.
The company said a shift of 3.6m shares out of the US over the course of
last week was minimal considering that it coincided with the company's
results.
However, at its morning meeting, stockbroker Nomura said the American
Depositary Receipt holding in BP had dropped by 1.4 percentage points to
25.9 per cent over the past four months and technical position-taking by
marketmakers meant the UK weighting could be substantially higher than the
74 per cent implied by the amount held in the form of ADRs. The conclusion
is that UK institutions have a less pressing need to pick up BP stock than
some might believe.
High street banks received support from James Capel, with National
Westminster the main beneficiary. The agency broker upgraded to buy from a
hold and raised its 1994 profits forecast by Pounds 140m to Pounds 1.455bn.
More significantly it has lifted its 1995 estimate by Pounds 269m to Pounds
1.859bn.
The house believes NatWest's exposure to small businesses in the south of
England will also be beneficial as economic recovery gathers pace. NatWest
shares rose 8 before closing a net 4 up at 559p, with turnover heavy at
7.5m.
Capel moved Abbey National to a buy from a hold and Barclays to a hold from
a sell. Abbey rose 9 to 522p, while Barclays was flat at 583p.
A Capel downgrade on HSBC was given further impetus by a weak Hong Kong
market. The broker lowered its predictions to 1994 profits of Pounds
2.687bn, against Pounds 2.93bn previously, and to 1995 profits of Pounds
3.085bn, against Pounds 3.40bn previously, bringing them back to the middle
of the range of analysts' estimates. HSBC fell 17 to 992p, while other Hong
Kong related stocks, Standard Chartered and Cable and Wireless, retreated 16
to 1285p and 9 to 483p respectively.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson fell 16 to 652p ahead of full-year figures
due today. Profits are expected to have at least doubled but the shares have
run up sharply.
Composite insurer General Accident recovered 21 to 681p after recent
underperformance. SGST reiterated its buy stance on the stock.
Insurance broker Willis Corroon was held back by US selling and dipped 6 to
209p.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries slipped a penny to 497p
after an insurance company managed by Farmers, its US subsidiary, said it
would have to pay out about Pounds 400m in claims resulting from January's
Californian earthquake.
The release of the latest batch of retail sales figures provided inspiration
for a variety of moves among stores stocks. The dip in clothing and footwear
purchases was behind a retreat in Sears, off 1 1/2 at 121p, a lacklustre
showing by Next, up 2 at 226p, Stylo, stuck at 249p, and Austin Reed,
unchanged at 194p.
But better mixed retail sales, up 0.3 per cent in January, helped several
stocks, including Marks and Spencer, up 6 1/2 at 432 1/2 p. Great Universal
Stores climbed 7 to 609p, encouraged by the latest statistics and
underpinned by the current share buy-back story.
Increased prescription charges lifted Boots and Lloyds Chemists 7 to 543p
and 16 to 347p respectively.
However, Kingfisher remained a weak market, slipping 3 to 634p. The stock
has now declined 18 per cent in six weeks, as a bearish trading statement
was compounded by concern over Darty, the French electrical retailer. The
shares have been further unsettled by the resignation of Woolworth's
managing director over the weekend.
Independent oil and gas company Enterprise Oil eased 4 to 435p after NatWest
Securities reiterated a warning that continuing low crude oil prices would
make it difficult for the group to cover its dividend.
Television company Yorkshire Tyne Tees, which has been heated up by bid
speculation, came off the boil when some investors took profits and the
shares fell 28 to 336p.
Specialist engineering group James Wilkes, the subject of bid speculation in
recent sessions, declined 6 to 176p after saying it was not in talks with
stakeholder Suter, 2 ahead at 219p, or any other company. The conglomerate
last week increased its holding in Wilkes by 8.7 percentage points to 29.53
per cent. APV put on 3 at 130p, with SG Warburg said to have recommended the
stock.
British Airways brushed aside Tuesday's downgrades that followed the release
of third-quarter results. The shares bounced 6 to 479p. NatWest Securities
reiterated its buy recommendation, saying: 'Continued cost control combined
with rising load factors will result in rapid profits growth in future
years.'
Fears about the future of transport leasing group Tiphook saw the shares
lose 4 more to 54p.
Building and construction stocks were firm on the hope of interest rate cuts
and reports of strong mortgage demand in January. Bid talk added flavour to
the positive sentiment, with Wimpey, up 5 at 235p, mooted as a possible
target.
Building materials issues were strong, with Strauss Turnbull and UBS said to
be behind the rise of Redland, ahead 8 at 600p. Rugby Group added 7 at 338p
and Tarmac 8 at 194p, with Cazenove said to be pushing the latter.

FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe falls as Airbus loses deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that a Dollars 6bn Saudi Arabian aircraft order was to go to the US
rather than the Airbus consortium hit British Aerospace, which holds 20 per
cent of the European aircraft group.
The shares fell sharply early in the day, and anticipation of the US success
kept the stock in the doldrums before a mid-afternoon announcement from
President Clinton confirmed the order. Dealers said one US investment bank
was trying to sell a block of shares but finding no willing takers and that
was causing an additional drag on the share price.
However, late news that BAe's space division had been chosen as prime
contractor for a Pounds 300m project for two new defence satellites helped
the stock recover some of the earlier drop. The shares closed 9 off at 531p
after being 15 down at one stage.
Ironically, BAe is believed to be in talks about the sale of its space
division with Matra Marconi Space, one of the main subcontractors on the new
defence satellites, thought to be the most likely purchaser. A price of
between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m has been suggested.

FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed hopes of a reduction in UK interest rates following the release of a
mixed set of economic statistics kept stock index futures buoyant, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Having opened strongly at 3,396, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index
drifted for the first hour of trading as dealers awaited the 9.30am release
of economic data on retail price inflation, unemployment and retail sales
volume.
When they came, the statistics brought renewed speculation of a cut in
interest rates which sent dealers bidding for stock. A slight squeeze
occurred over the lunchtime period, as several of the big houses joined
independent traders as buyers of the contract.
A firm gilts sector, along with a positive start to trading on Wall Street,
gave a further boost to the contract, helping it to maintain a good premium
to cash for most of the day.
March finished at 3,414, up 24 from its previous close but around 3 points
below its fair value premium to cash of about minus 5. Volume at the
official close was 16,379 lots.
In traded options, there was strong business in the FT-SE 100 option, ahead
of tomorrow's expiry. A total of 42,417 contracts were dealt, of which
19,442 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,453 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Abbey National topped the stock options with 2,573 lots traded.

FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 surpasses 3,400 on rate cut
hopes - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that a further cut in British interest rates may not be too far away
were increased by the latest outpouring of economic data and provided
another shot in the arm for a rejuvenated UK stock market, which moved
effortlessly back above the 3,400 Footsie level yest-erday.
At the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index was up 24.5 at 3,417.7 and the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index was ahead 22.1 at 4,050.6. Over the past two sessions
the 100 index has risen some 54 points or 1.6 per cent since it was hit by
fears of an impending slide throughout world markets.
The surge in confidence and market prices yesterday came from a deluge of
economic numbers published by the UK authorities, which mostly provided more
justification for a further cut in interest rates.
More encouragement for the UK market came from an initial good performance
from Wall Street yesterday, plus a rise in UK gilt-edged stocks.
Just about the only element of disappointment in the market was another
relatively slack day's trading. Turnover came out at a surprisingly low
817.5m shares, with activity in non-Footsie stocks accounting for 64 per
cent of the total. Dealers were surprised at the low level of business,
which they said represented only a small upturn from the weather-affected
levels seen on Monday and Tuesday. The value of customer business on Tuesday
edged up to Pounds 1.62bn from Monday's Pounds 1.45bn, but both these
figures were well below recent average levels.
The equity market opened higher, but just short of the 3,400 Footsie level,
responding to the good rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight
and shrugging aside the disappointing performance of the Hong Kong market.
Some said the latter had been affected by selling of Hong Kong stocks from
one of the big Anglo-Hong Kong funds.
The trigger for the market's strong performance came, however, with the
day's economic figures. Market strategists said the unemployment numbers
provided the greatest shock. Although expected by most analysts to show a
fall of upwards of 40,000, they rose by more than 15,000, and this figure,
combined with slightly worrying retail sales numbers, produced an immediate
uptick across the equity market.
The FT-SE 100 made rapid progress thereafter, and was helped by the latest
rise in the Dow Industrial Average. It reached the day's peak of 3,423.2, up
30 points, before easing back on profit-taking.
Senior traders in the market said the day's economic news provided ample
justification for last week's  1/4 percentage point interest rate reduction.
'It puts paid to last week's story that the cut was pol-itically, rather
than economically, inspired; it is becoming clearer that it was the Bank of
England, via Mr Eddie George, and not the chancellor of the exchequer, who
was doing the driving,' commented one dealer. He added that the market was
much happier having appreciated that the reduction was undertaken on purely
economic grounds.
He also said the market was increasingly looking for another quarter of a
point off UK rates in the medium term and had now fully asbsorbed the story
that US rates are likely to go higher this year.
Traders said the market was still affected by stock shortages in crucial
areas. 'It is the same old story, you cannot buy stocks you are short of and
you cannot sell the longs at the right price,' said one.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rise fades as inflation
data awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices posted modest gains yesterday in a lacklustre session
highlighted by news of a Dollars 6bn contract for two US defence
contractors, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 9.00 up at 3,937.27, some way
below its session peak of 3,949.65. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged 0.27
higher to 472.79, while the Nasdaq composite added 2.50 at 792.62. Trading
volume on the New York SE was 295m shares.
Equities rose from the opening bell, thanks in part to the stability of the
dollar. After big losses earlier in the week tied to concern about the
possible outbreak of a trade war with Japan, the US currency held steady at
about Y103.80 yesterday. Bonds, which had also been rattled by the trade
dispute, were similarly becalmed, with the benchmark 30-year government
issue showing little change on the day.
Activity in the bond market was listless as traders awaited today's
all-important inflation data. Analysts expect the January consumer price
index to show a gain of about 0.3 per cent. Anything below that should boost
share prices, but if consumer prices are seen to have moved substantially
higher last month, fears that the Federal Reserve might put up short-term
interest rates would resurface.
It was concern about that possibility which kept some equity investors on
the sidelines yesterday, and limited the stock market's advance.
The biggest development of the day was the announcement that McDonnell
Douglas and Boeing would split a Dollars 6bn order for commercial jets from
Saudi Arabia. Boeing climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 46 1/2 on the news. The
stock also benefited from Tuesday's announcement from the aircraft
manufacturer that it planned to increase its monthly production of 767s.
McDonnell Douglas, meanwhile, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 118 7/8 .
Hewlett-Packard was another of the session's stars, advancing Dollars 3 5/8
to Dollars 89 1/8 in volume of 2.6m shares after the computer manufacturer
announced fiscal first-quarter net income of Dollars 368m, up from Dollars
261m a year earlier.
The good news from Hewlett-Packard lifted other technology stocks.
Motorola surged Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 104 1/2 in the wake of US threats
to impose trade sanctions on Japan if Tokyo refused to give better market
access to the company's cellular telephones.
Many of the best performing blue chip issues in recent weeks had strong
outings. 3M was Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 109 1/2 , Alcoa advanced
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 79 5/8 and United Technologies climbed Dollars 2
5/8 to Dollars 71.
On the Nasdaq market, QVC continued to rise following its defeat in the
Paramount bid battle, adding Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 51 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto received a late boost from a recovery in the precious metals
sub-sector and ended a sluggish session mildly firmer.
An analyst said there were 'spotty areas of strength elsewhere - forest
products, base metals - but the market is still showing some signs of
hesitancy going into February 22' (the budget).
The TSE 300 index gained 9.7 at 4,424.1. Turnover was 67.37m shares valued
at CDollars 774m and rises and falls were almost equal at 406 to 405.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region volatile, mostly
on downside as Nikkei firms
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A lull in the yen's ascent against the dollar prompted bargain hunting and
the Nikkei 225 average gained moderate ground, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 index climbed above the 19,000 level again, ending with an advance
of 77.51 at 19,052.11 after a day's high of 19,267.03 and low of 19,032.40
just before the close.
Dealers led the way as participants bought to adjust their positions, and
this pushed equities up in the morning session as the dollar strengthened
against the Japanese currency.
Continued dollar buying by the Bank of Japan in the foreign exchange market
also encouraged some investors. The Topix index of all first section stocks
firmed 3.76 to 1,559.10, although the Nikkei 300 capitalisation weighted
index lost 0.05 at 287.65.
Traders said reports of North Korea's decision to accept international
inspection of its nuclear power sites also supported investor confidence.
However, many investors, remaining wary of currency fluctuations due to
lingering concern over US-Japan trade tensions, were still absent.
Volume totalled 360m shares, against Tuesday's 389m. Rising issues
outnumbered declines by 770 to 265, with 136 stocks unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.43 at 1,288.56.
Speculative trading by indvidual investors led activity. Shindengen
Electric, the leader in volume terms, closed a net Y30 off at Y1,140. The
issue has been actively bought recently on rumours of purchases by
speculative investors, and was higher in the morning session yesterday on
reports of better than expected profits for the current year.
Domestic investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y3,000
to Y898,000. East Japan Railway gained Y8,000 at Y492,000.
Some export related stocks recovered, having lost ground previously on fears
of lower profits due to the rise in the yen. Fujitsu moved ahead Y13 to Y991
and Hitachi firmed Y5 to Y875. However, Sony finally lost Y10 at Y5,860 in
spite of initial strength, and NEC declined Y14 to Y971.
Some financials were lower on profit-taking. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank shed Y10
to Y1,920 and Sumitomo Bank declined Y40 to Y2,110, while Tokio Marine and
Fire, the non-life insurer, fell Y20 to Y1,280.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 190.02 to 21,215.83 in volume of 55.7m
shares.
Roundup
There was widespread volatility in the region, with most of it on the
downside.
HONG KONG shelved UK-based recovery hopes after an early attempt to indulge
them, the Hang Seng index tumbling 378.19, or 3.4 per cent, to 10,634.14
after an initial high of 11,119.51. Turnover remained modest, at HKDollars
6.14bn.
Brokers blamed selling from the US, and by British business interests.
Sellers talked of an expected rise in interest rates tomorrow as HSBC slid
HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 115. Conglomerates led the retreat, however,
Hutchison slipping HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 34.50, Jardine Matheson
HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 72 and Swire 'A' HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 57.50.
TAIWAN also reversed early gains, ending 2 per cent lower as late selling
focused on the weak financial sector. The weighted index opened 100 points
up, but closed 122.38 down at 5,862.63. Turnover was moderate at TDollars
58.3bn.
Taiwan has its own trade talks with the US next week, and investors have
also been worried about the central bank's interest rate policy.
JAKARTA extended Tuesday's falls, the composite index ending 7.89, or 1.35
per cent, lower at 574.82. Bank International Indonesia dropped by 17.4 per
cent to Rp7,025 in thin volume, dealers saying that restrictions on foreign
ownership might be affecting the domestic market.
BOMBAY weakened after a dull opening led funds and institutions into
selling, the BSE index losing a further 92.71, or 2.3 per cent, at 3,807.42.
Brokers said foreign institutional investors, who fuelled a bull run between
November and January, have cut back on their purchases after facing problems
over share deliveries.
KARACHI saw early buying interest take flight after reports of possible
unrest in the north west frontier province, the KSE 100 index surrendering
21.47 at 2,401.52.
SEOUL said sentiment improved on North Korea's decision to accept
international inspection of its nuclear sites. The composite index finished
18.62, or 2.1 per cent, ahead at 920.43.
North Korea agreed on Tuesday to allow inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency to check seven declared nuclear plants in the hardline
communist state.
AUSTRALIA gained on the advances in the US and Japan, the All Ordinaries
index closing 15.0 higher at 2,249.0. Resource issues improved, Western
Mining climbing 19 cents to ADollars 7.61 on its partnership in a
'technically feasible' gas discovery.
SINGAPORE saw revived interest in over-the-counter trading in Malaysian
shares. Meanwhile, the Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.85 to
2,341.38, with Rothmans Industries up SDollars 1.15 at SDollars 9.30 on news
of a special dividend.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Latin America reflects flow of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America has been benefiting over recent weeks from a general movement
of institutional money out of Asia.
This is clearly indicated by a 20 per cent rise in dollar terms since the
start of the year, compared to an 11 per cent fall in Asia. The European
markets have been hit even harder, dropping by some 20 per cent since
January, although here the story has been influenced by a steep decline in
Turkey.
On a summary inspection, Brazil stands out as the clear leader in Latin
America this year. But, says Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson in London,
since last November all of the markets in the region have performed in a
broadly similar manner, with rises of between 42 to 52 per cent in dollar
terms.
While investors have been encouraged by progress in balancing the Brazilian
budget, it is still too early, says Mr Palmer, to view the country's
economic difficulties as all but solved. A lot depends on whether the
introduction of a new index designed to tackle inflation will make a
significant impression. He takes the view that this is far from certain,
especially because of the fluid political situation, with elections due
later this year.
Sri Lanka has been showing solid performance in south Asia, with investors
attracted by its relative cheapness, compared with India. Ms Susan Murphy of
Smith New Court comments that the launch of new country funds has helped.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed feelings on German rate
cut prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were mixed feelings about today's Bundesbank meeting, some dealers
around Europe talking about the possibility of a German rate cut and others,
particularly the French, almost giving up on the prospect after a four
months' wait, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Reinhard Fischer, a partner at Research Vision in London, agreed that the
current consensus was against a rate cut today, observed that the Bundesbank
had managed to wrong-foot the markets about 80 per cent of the time, and
argued in favour of the proposition, as follows:
German inflation was down, with a year-on year figure of 3.5 per cent in
January against a 3.8 per cent average for the final quarter of 1993;
Buba has said that the German recession is not over yet;
There was a 'window of opportunity' in the currency markets, with the D-Mark
strong against the dollar in the aftermath of the US/Japanese trade talks
collapse; and
There were indications that German M3 is slowing after its seemingly
inexorable growth in 1993.
Admittedly, said Mr Fischer, there was no clear evidence yet of the M3
slowdown; the German repo rate, so often an indicator of key rate cuts, was
firmly cemented at 6 per cent; and there was the possibility of industrial
strife, particu-larly in Germany's metal based industries.
However, he said, the balance of argument was in favour of a cut, especially
since the next Buba meeting, on March 3, fell just ahead of the first of 19
election dates for various constituencies and groups to be held in Germany
this year.
FRANKFURT consolidated Tuesday's post-bourse gains on the interest rate
theme and added a little more, the Dax index closing up 20.99 at 2,136.61,
or 5.90 ahead of the previous afternoon's level; the post-bourse yesterday
was relatively quiet.
Turnover rose from DM6.7bn to DM8.6bn. Front-line interest rate sensitive
stocks rose in echelon, led by Deutsche Bank, up DM20.50 at DM829.50, and
Dresdner, DM12.80 better at DM422.80, although utilities seemed relatively
subdued.
In carmakers, Volkswagen was relatively weak, closing 50 pfg lower at
DM445.50 after Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the company's senior debt.
PARIS reflected the view that hopes for interest rate cuts today had all but
evaporated, although there remained a few who still believed that the Bank
of France might move independently and shave a quarter of a percentage point
off domestic rates.
The CAC-40 index improved 6.35 to 2,264.32 in below average turnover of
FFr4.5bn.
Rhone-Poulenc added FFr2.20 to FFr150.40 in spite of reporting profits at
the lower end of most analysts' expectations. The recently privatised
chemicals and pharmaceuticals company also said that it did not expect a
significant recovery in profits before 1996.
ZURICH extended its blue chip recovery, the SMI index rising 43.1, or 1.4
per cent to 3,033.4. Banks were lifted by SBC's 36 per cent rise in 1993
profits which exceeded analysts expectations and took SBC bearers up SFr16
to SFr506.
Ciba bearers were relatively weak, rising only SFr2 to SFr910 on the news
that Pharma Vision, the investment fund, might sell its stake in the
company.
AMSTERDAM moved higher for the second day in succession with Hoogovens
advancing Fl 2.10 to Fl 63.40 on news that it had been exempted from fines
imposed by the EU on a number of steel manufacturers for operating a cartel.
The AEX index finished up 1.71 at 431.61.
Fokker drifted down a further 80 cents to Fl 20.70, up from a session low of
Fl 19.70, in further reaction to its planned job cuts.
MILAN saw a build up of volume towards the close but general activity
throughout the session remained subdued.
The Mibtel index put on 39 to 10,771 .
Montedison attracted attention and the shares closed L58 higher at L1,179,
although traders were unable to report specific news that could have
warranted buying. Fiat was another of the day's risers, up L97 at L4,800 in
spite of a Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of its commercial paper.
STOCKHOLM saw Ericsson Bs rise SKr18 to SKr360 after gains on Wall Street,
and the Affarsvarlden General index put on 23.40, or 1.5 per cent at
1,435.10. OSLO was lifted by gains abroad, general optimism on the Norwegian
economy and two more gold medals at the Lillehammer Olympics, the all-share
index rising 10.56, or 1.6 per cent to 678.50.
ATHENS rallied after three consecutive losses, investors betting that the
government would not make changes at the National Economy ministry where the
minister, Mr George Yennimatas, is facing health problems.
ISTANBUL saw a further 8 per cent gain to bring its rise on the week so far
to 27 per cent. The composite index added 1,247.83 to 17,681.32.
Brokers remarked that a semblance of stability had returned to the currency
markets, helping to inject a note of optimism.
Turnover was down to TL899bn after Tuesday's TL1,259bn.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Pounds weathers mixed data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling yesterday maintained a firm tone in spite of the release of mixed
economic data and a strong D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
After falling nearly a pfennig to DM2.54 on the release of subdued UK retail
sales and prices data, and unemployment figures which showed a surprise
rise, the pound later recovered to end in London at DM2.5471 - slightly
above Tuesday's close of DM2.5463.
Market reaction was that, while the figures were soft enough to justify last
week's UK rate cut, they did not indicate that the economic recovery was in
any jeopardy.
The D-Mark was stronger against most currencies ahead of today's Bundesbank
council meeting, while the dollar-yen rate stabilised following considerable
volatility earlier in the week.
UK economic statistics showed subdued price pressures in January, with
headline retail price inflation for the month at 2.5 per cent.
Analysts said the key figure was probably the 0.6 per cent increase in
retail sales. Although towards the lower end of expectations, it did confirm
that consumer spending - whose strength is pivotal to an economic upturn -
continues to grow. Unemployment rose by a surprise 15,000, the first
increase in months, but this was treated as a seasonal blip.
The Treasury said the aim of economic recovery with low inflation was being
achieved. Against a year ago, company output was up 3.5 per cent, retail
sales up nearly 4.0 per cent and unemployment down 200,000. Underlying
inflation for the last four months was the lowest in 25 years.
Observers said the figures left the way open for a further  1/4 percentage
point rate cut. Sterling appeared fairly strong yesterday, holding its own
against the stronger D-Mark.
Market opinion was, as usual, split over what can be expected from today's
Bundesbank meeting. A Reuters survey of 20 economists found that 10 do not
expect a rate reduction, eight forecast a cut and two say it is too close to
call. The D-Mark was stronger on most European crosses, reflecting a market
view that rates will not be cut today.
Yesterday's repo tender - where the Bank allocated a smaller than expected
sum to the market - was seen as making a rate cut unlikely. The discount
rate, which stands at 5.75 per cent, was last reduced at the Bundesbank's
October 22 council meeting.
The bank's monthly economic report, released yesterday, did not favour any
particular analysis of what the council might decide. Some observers noted
that the bank had left room for a cut. It reported success in combating
inflation - the annualised rate of increase in German prices over the last
six months was only 2.5 per cent - and said the recession was not yet over.
Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said he had little
doubt the central bank wanted to cut rates. Although the unresolved IG
Metall wage dispute is seen as reason for not lowering rates, Mr Holtham
asked: 'If they do not cut now, when will they cut?' He noted that if they
choose to delay, they may well at their next meeting be faced with a less
favourable environment in the form of a firmer dollar and a set of
unfavourable M3 money supply data for January. There is also a widely held
view in the market that the D-Mark risks being penalised if Bundesbank
policies are seen as hindering economic recovery.
The dollar recovered ground against the yen amid determined intervention
from the Bank of Japan and an apparent softening of stance from the US
administration. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, described
recent yen strength as an 'accidental' by-product of the trade dispute. It
closed in London at Y103.55 per dollar after Tuesday's Y103.10. It finished
trading in New York at Y103.80.
Although there is widespread agreement that recent yen strength is
unsustainable, few are prepared to argue that the yen will not rise to Y100
against the dollar. But Mr Tony Norfield, UK economist at ABN-Amro, argues
that the D-Mark/yen rate may be serving as a leading indicator of a reversal
of yen strength.
Mr Norfield said the recent strength of the D-Mark meant that it had not
suffered as much as other currencies against the yen. Although the yen had
recently been close to its all-time low of Y59 to the D-Mark, it had bounced
back to trade yesterday at the top end of its recent Y59.60 to Y60.35
trading range. He said there was a 'great reluctance' on the part of traders
to sell the yen below its record low.
'What we could be seeing as the yen situation unravels is the yen value
falling across the board. If that did happen, what we would see is unwinding
of recent dollar weakness.' Bolstering the view of a possible turnround is
increasing evidence that fund managers are buying dollars against yen,
believing the US currency has fallen too far.
Liquidity conditions were tight in the UK money markets, with few bills
forthcoming early in the day. Most of the assistance provided by the Bank of
England to the market was at unspecified overnight rates. The Bank put
Pounds 655m into the market this way. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds
258m of assistance at its established rates. This compared with a forecast
liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m, revised from Pounds 850m.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Co-operative spirit fades as
world bauxite prices languish - Canute James talks to the president of the
industry association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Producers of bauxite have reacted with disappointment to the US's decision
to reduce its strategic stockpile of the aluminium ore, which it has built
up since the early 1960s.
Mr Nenad Altman, secretary-general of the International Bauxite Association,
warns that the move will affect all bauxite producers in an industry already
depressed by falling demand because of the weak international aluminium
market.
'It is not just the quantity which is being sold, which is about 3m tonnes
over two years,' Mr Altman says. 'Producers are also being affected by the
price, which is about Dollars 8.50 per tonne. This will push prices further
down. It is a small proportion of world production but the psychological
impact on the market will be severe.'
The waning fortunes of the world's bauxite producers have coincided with
some soul-searching among the IBA's members and within the organisation.
When the association was created 20 years ago, metals companies were worried
that it would attempt to build an industry cartel - some even made highly
unrealistic comparisons to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. But the IBA has steered clear of such activity, acting primarily
a data bank and forum for its members.
In better times the association's members have accounted for about 85 per
cent of the western world's bauxite production, while contributing 54 per
cent of alumina (aluminium oxide) production and 18 per cent of primary
aluminium output. The loss of two founding members - the Dominican Republic
and Haiti - in the 1980s, because their industries folded, had no effect on
the IBA. But Australia'a decision two years ago not to renew its membership
seriously reduced the organisation's weight and influence. Australia is the
world's largest bauxite producer.
'Given the state of the market and the problems facing bauxite producers,
now is the time they should be getting closer together to defend their
common interests,' says a representative of the Jamaican industry. 'But this
is not happening. There appears to be less interest now in the IBA, even
among some members which have been delinquent in meeting their financial
obligations to the organisation.'
With members' financial support to the IBA based on volume of production,
Australia's departure deprived the association of 40 per cent of its budget.
'This has inevitably affected the association's budget,' says Mr Altman.
'The majority of the member countries are facing financial difficulties, and
so we could not operate as before because of a reduced budget.'
There seems to be little enthusiasm among the world's major producers to
join the IBA. Attempts to recruit Brazil only led to the country adopting
observer status.
Expansion may have to await to resolution of a political conundrum. The
association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia,
Jamaica, Sierra Leone and Surinam, but also Yugoslavia, which no longer
exists. 'The IBA is willing to extend membership to all parts of the
previous Yugoslavia if they wish to continue,' says the secretary-general.
'There is bauxite in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia, but the major
producer is Bosnia.'
Contributing to the IBA's relatively low profile has been its inability to
negotiate a commodity pact between bauxite producers and consumers under the
aegis of the United Nations Committee on Trade and Development. The attempt
was abandoned because of lack of support from either side, and because
bauxite could not be organised in pacts similar to those for other
commodities such as cocoa and coffee, Mr Altman explains.
'There is now an attempt to find common ground for a forum of producers and
consumers - a loose body to discuss the state of the industry,' he says.
'This would involve all three levels of the industry - bauxite, alumina and
aluminium. There have been ad hoc meetings to see if such a forum can be
established. . . but there is still reluctance by some to be part of this.'
However, the IBA secretary-general maintains that the association's main
role is to provide its members with information on the industry - a role
that is increasingly important when the market is languishing. Bauxite
producers are 'between a rock and a hard place', he says, and have to decide
whether it is better to sell more ore at lower prices or less at higher
prices. And he warns that ore producers have no basis on which to anticipate
an improvement in the market over the next two years.
'These factors are not within the direct influence of bauxite producers,' Mr
Altman admits. 'What they need is a healthy economic recovery in the
industrialised countries. The market is now heavily oversupplied and any
hopes for a significant increase in consumption to soak up the surplus will
not be realised soon.'

The presidents of Argentina and Chile have formally opened a 265-mile oil
pipeline crossing the southern Andes. It links the Neuquen basin,
Argentina's biggest oilfield, with Chile's Pacific port of Concepcion.
The Dollars 215m pipeline built by YPF, Argentina's privatised oil giant,
and Chile's state-owned oil company ENAP, will allow Argentina's oil export
earnings to be increased by Dollars 500m a year.
It has a transport capacity of 107,000 barrels a day and will relieve
pressure on Argentina's domestic pipeline system, overloaded by a big
increase in production following deregulation of the oil industry in 1991
and YPF's privatisation last year.
The presence of Argentina's President Carlos Menem and President Patricio
Aylwin of Chile at Tuesday's inauguration ceremony further underlined
steadily improving relations between two traditional enemies who almost went
to war in the south in 1978.
Chilean companies have invested Dollars 2bn in Argentina since 1990, mainly
in privatised power stations that include strategically sensitive
hydro-electric dams in the southern Andes.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Upturn in rubber demand
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Use of synthetic rubber by the former Soviet republics and China, Vietnam
and North Korea is likely to rise sharply over the next five years,
according to a report by the International Institute of Synthetic Rubber
Producers.
The Houston-based trade association said it expected worldwide consumption
to increase by 22 per cent to more than 11m tonnes in 1998, after a 6.6 per
cent fall induced by recession last year.
Growth in synthetic rubber consumption in the Commonwealth of Independent
States would jump by 90 per cent, partly reflecting a bounce back from a 37
per cent fall last year caused by economic difficulties.
China, Vietnam and North Korea would use 34 per cent more synthetic rubber,
which is used particularly for tyres and tyre products.
The institute also predicts that consumption of natural rubber will rise by
an annual rate of 3.2 per cent over the next five years. The former Soviet
republics, which used to favour synthetic, would see particularly strong
growth.
'As the region trends toward a more traditional balance between synthetic
and natural rubber, 1994 growth in natural rubber consumption is expected to
be 20 per cent,' said Mr Conrad Jankowski, managing director.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper price surge trimmed back at
LME - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices fluctuated widely at the London Metal Exchange yesterday,
leaving traders in two minds about the market's next move.
The three months quotation, which on Tuesday had dipped to Dollars 1,830 a
tonne before finding firm support, extended the ensuing rally to Dollars
1,909 in the morning before falling back to Dollars 1,890.50 at the close,
still up Dollars 46 on the day. Dealers said Chinese and Japanese buying had
featured in the morning surge. 'If copper doesn't get through Dollars 1,900
then the whole complex could collapse again,' warned one analyst.
ALUMINIUM followed the same pattern, the three months position closing
Dollars 15 below its high but Dollars 27.50 up on the day at Dollars 1,280 a
tonne, while the ZINC price closed Dollars 20 ahead at Dollars 955.50 a
tonne, after touching Dollars 978.50.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market 'faces long
haul'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Market equilibrium in the troubled aluminium sector is unlikely before 1996,
according to a study by Australian Mineral Economics.
The forecaster says that, with market prices hovering above USDollars 1,000
a tonne and a record 4.2m tonnes of primary aluminium in world stockpiles,
the industry 'now faces a long haul back'.
Prices will remain weak in the short-term, it suggests, and could drop below
the USDollars 1,000 a tonne in the first half of this year.
AME forecasts an average price of Dollars 1,100 a tonne in 1994, rising to
USDollars 1,400 by 1995. Consumption growth in 1994 and 1995 will average
close to 4 per cent, it thinks, helped by the US economic recovery and
improvement in other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. The consumption growth in OECD economies 'will be slower
than in previous cyclical upswings', the study says. But the upturn should
be sufficient to outstrip primary production in the western world and CIS
imports. Industry stocks, therefore, should see some reduction.
Only in 1996 does AME suggest that prices could be moving back towards their
'long-term trend' at about Dollars 1,600 a tonne. By the late-1990s, it
predicts further rises to Dollars 1,800 or higher, with stocks possibly
dropping to as little as 1.2 months consumption by 1999. A new cyclical
downturn could then see stocks rising again in the year 2000.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal exporters reeling from
second price blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp reduction in coking coal prices agreed between Japan and its
Canadian and Australian suppliers has been followed by an even bigger cut on
the European market. In the first major European settlement for 1994
supplies the Canadian producer Fording has cut its prices to the Spanish
steel producer Ensidesa by Dollars 4 a tonne.
In Japan all the other Canadian and Australian coking coal exporters were
forced to match Fording's price cut of Dollars 3.85, setting a new benchmark
of Dollars 45.45 a tonne. With the Ensidesa agreement not only is Fording
accepting an even bigger price reduction but it is cutting from a much lower
base of Dollars 45 a tonne.
While some Canadian producers have accepted that they will be forced to
match the Dollars 41 price for sales into Spain, the ability of the
Australians to accept this as a price setter will be limited. It is believed
that only BHP Australia, the world's biggest coal exporter, will be able to
accept the new Japanese benchmark; and even this company will be pushed to
match the Ensidesa price if it becomes accepted elsewhere in Europe.
Already the earlier settlement in Tokyo has led to a series of strikes in
Australia, with Mr John Maitland, the United Mineworkers Federation
president, urging the government against approving the new prices (the
Department of Primary Industries and Energy has the right to block any coal
price settlements - a power it seldom uses).
Senior mining company executives who privately applaud Mr Maitland's view -
if not his strike call - predict mine closures as a result of the new
prices.
Fording's willingness to accept lower and lower prices is driven by its
desire to maximise tonnage from both Fording River - a mine that suffered an
extended strike in 1992 and did not return to full production for the 1993
coal year - and Greenhills, which it purchased from the Westar Bankruptcy.
And what is judged good for the mine is doubly so for its partner, the
Canadian Pacific railroad, which carries all Fording's coal for export at
Vancouver.
Fording appears determined to produce and sell 9m tonnes this year, an
ambition which in a weak market with increasing supply can only be achieved
one way - by predatory pricing.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Rate-cut hopes lift gilts as continental
prices fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK

<TEXT>
UK gilts were the only European government bonds to post gains yesterday.
They were boosted by a raft of economic data which indicated that the UK
recovery was slowing while inflation pressured remain subdued.
'People are now gearing up for further rate cuts,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK
economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. 'I've heard some people say that the
authorities should have waited (until yesterday) and cut the base rate by
1/2 point,' he said in reference to last Tuesday's  1/4 -point cut.
However, weakness in bond markets across Europe put a lid on the gilts'
gains. 'I would guess that the good data we've seen in the last three days
would normally put about three points on the gilt market,' said Mr Briscoe.
However, because of weak markets elsewhere, the gilt rally stalled after
1/2 point.
Nevertheless, he noted that recent high volatility appeared to have eased
off in recent days, and this week's 'unambiguously good data might just have
given the market the lift the Bank needs ahead of next week's gilt auction'.
Elsewhere, markets continued to weaken as participants grew increasingly
gloomy on the chances of a cut in German interest rates at today's
Bundesbank council meeting.
Bunds broke technical resistance early, clawed back some losses during the
day, but then dropped back sharply towards the close. 'Ironically, bunds are
being hurt by the bearish sentiment in other markets regarding the prospect
of unchanged German rates,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's
futures and options group.
Late in the day, the March bund futures contract on Liffe traded at 98.65,
down 0.39 point from Tuesday.
French bonds ended only slightly lower on the day, with early losses
recouped by late short-covering. However, traders warned that prices were
likely to fall further if the Bundesbank leaves interest rates unchanged.
The notional bond futures contract on Matif fell 0.02 point to 128.64.
The higher-yielding markets took another pounding, with the Italian bond
future down more than a point in the morning.
According to Mr Marco Pianelli, southern Europe economist at Nomura Research
Institute, these markets have suffered from heavy switching into German
bonds, or into cash, amid the prevailing interest-rate uncertainty, and
because of their currencies' weakness against the D-Mark.
He said political jitters ahead of next month's Italian elections were less
of a factor in the sell-off.
If the Bundesbank leaves rates unchanged today, the high-yielders are likely
to fall further, said Mr Pianelli. However, he suggested that 'a further
sell-off would provide a good buying opportunity', with the Italian 10-year
benchmark offering value at between 8.90 and 9 per cent yield.
After posting strong gains on Monday and Tuesday, Japanese government bonds
fell back as the yen weakened, the stock market stabilised, and supply was
boosted by large corporate bond issuance.
'With little data out for the rest of the week, the focus will be on the
degree to which the seasonal increase in corporate supply can be absorbed -
creating minor downside risk,' said analysts at Yamaichi International.
Longer-dated US Treasury prices drifted lower in light trading yesterday as
dealers and investors awaited today's inflation news.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 easier
at 97 9/32 , with the yield inching ahead to 6.452 per cent. The two-year
note was unchanged at 99-7/32, to carry a yield of 4.404 per cent.
The day's only economic news - a 17.6 per cent decline in January housing
starts - had little impact. This was because the data were distorted by the
impact of the harsh winter storms that hit large parts of the US during the
month.
The lack of a reaction also reflected cautiousness ahead of the release of
the January consumer prices index this morning.
Analysts were expecting a 0.3 per cent rise in the CPI, but investors feared
that a significantly larger figure could lead the Federal Reserve to put up
short-term interest rates again.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Bonds: EIB braves saturated sector with
Dollars 500m offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only the most prestigious borrowers were brave enough to launch offerings in
the increasingly saturated Eurobond market yesterday.
The European Investment Bank raised Dollars 500m through a widely-expected
offering of 10-year Eurobonds, and the ambitious pricing of eight basis
points over the yield on US Treasuries reflected the intense competition for
the mandate.
Bidding on the delayed-rate settlement, a mechanism favoured by the EIB to
protect itself against changes in interest rates before it on-lends the
proceeds of the issue, was also said to be fierce.
An official at lead manager SG Warburg said demand for the bonds had been
stronger in eastern Asia than in Europe, where investors were more sensitive
to yield spreads. He said when the bonds were freed to trade, the spread
widened to nine basis points, though other dealers reported that the bonds
were quoted at a yield spread of 10 basis points.
The market will watch the performance of the EIB's deal in the secondary
market: the spread on the bonds, which some believe could widen to between
12 and 15 basis points, is likely to influence the pricing of the
forthcoming offerings of 10-year dollar-denominated global bonds.
The continued recovery in the UK government bond market prompted
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the triple-A-rated German government
agency for redevelopment, to raise Pounds 200m through an offering of
10-year Eurobonds.
Dealers said the yield spread at launch, of 10 basis points over gilts, was
fair in the light of outstanding 10-year sterling-denominated Eurobonds by
other top-quality issuers. KfW's bonds also offered investors an alternative
to the recent supply of long-dated issues by financial institutions.
Lead manager JP Morgan said the recent underperformance of gilts compared
with German government bonds made KfW's bonds attractive to investors in
eastern Asia and Europe. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread
widened to around 11 basis points, according to JP Morgan. However, other
dealers said that, considering the short first coupon, the spread was closer
to 14 basis points.
Elsewhere, the return of SE-Banken to the Yankee market - the US domestic
market for foreign issuers - for the first time since May 1992 gave the
market a clear signal that investors were comfortable once again with Nordic
issuers, now that they had dealt with most of their financial woes.
The fact that SE-Banken was able to raise Dollars 200m through an issue of
15-year subordinated bonds, at a yield spread of 108 basis points over US
Treasuries, was taken as further evidence that the turnround was almost
complete.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: US derivatives regulator acts
on risk assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary derivatives regulator
in the US, is rushing to write new rules allowing it to examine the books of
parent companies with derivatives-dealing subsidiaries.
Although Congress gave the agency the powers to write holding company risk
assessment rules in 1992, the CFTC delayed enacting them. That delay proved
costly in January, when US subsidiaries of German industrial conglomerate
Metallgesellschaft faced large margin calls on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as oil futures and swaps positions went sour.
High-level CFTC officials say they were hampered in discovering the risk MG
Corp's positions presented to the Nymex clearing house because the agency
lacked the means to demand full disclosure of the over-the-counter swaps
positions. The situation was further exacerbated because MG Corp's credit
had been guaranteed by its German parent, whose books also proved
inaccessible to the CFTC.
The CFTC is now pushing holding company risk assessment rules into law. The
agency will hold a public hearing on the rules in Washington on February 23,
and hopes to publish the rule proposal in the Federal Register soon after.
The CFTC is often criticised for being ineffective. Industry attorneys say
the agency may have avoided promulgating the risk assessment rules for fear
of ruffling its futures broking consistency. However, a CFTC official said
the rule-making was not a priority, as the agency could use the Security and
Exchange Commission's year-old risk assessment powers in most cases.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard, the US computer and electronics group, yesterday reported a
continuing strong performance for its first fiscal quarter, with a 41 per
cent increase in net earnings and 24 per cent growth in revenue.
The results reflect the group's advance in the computer market at the
expense of some of its largest competitors, including IBM and Digital
Equipment.
HP's share price rose sharply on news of the results, which outstripped Wall
Street expectations. Its shares closed at Dollars 89 1/8 , up from Tuesday's
close of Dollars 85 1/2 .
'The year is off to a good start,' said Mr Lew Platt, chairman, president
and chief executive. 'We turned strong revenue growth into better profits,
largely due to focused management of operating expenses.'
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 368m, compared with Dollars 261m,
while earnings a share rose to Dollars 1.42 on approximately 259m shares of
common stock. This compares with Dollars 1.03 a share on about 252m shares
in the first quarter of fiscal 1993.
The increase in shares outstanding reflects a change in accounting for
employee stock options. The change reduced earnings a share by about four
cents, the company said.
Net revenue for the quarter was Dollars 5.7bn, compared with Dollars 4.6bn
in the first quarter of fiscal 1993. US sales were Dollars 2.6bn, an
increase of 25 per cent, while revenue from outside the US rose 24 per cent
to Dollars 3.1bn.
The first quarter was marked by strong demand for HP's computer printers,
personal computers, multi-user computers and workstations, the company said.
'Overall, we're very encouraged by the quarter's results,' said Mr Platt.
'This quarter's revenue growth far outpaced the increase in operating
expenses.' Operating expenses were 28.4 per cent of revenues, compared with
32.5 per cent in the same period a year ago. 'This is a key goal in our
efforts to improve profitability.'
Cost of goods sold was 61.1 per cent of net revenue, down slightly from 61.4
per cent in the preceding quarter. Mr Platt said that HP would continue to
maintain its emphasis on lean operating-expenses.
HP has set ambitious goals to play a central role in emerging markets for
'information superhighways' including interactive television and mobile
computing.
It aims to blend its traditional expertise in electronic test and
measurement equipment with its computer and communications technologies to
create a broad range of new products.

Neiman Marcus, the US fashion retailer, lifted net profits by 22 per cent to
Dollars 21.5m in its second quarter to January 29, helped by strong sales in
its Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores and NM Direct catalogue
division.
The company said the stores and catalogue had a particularly good Christmas,
but there were disappointing performances from the Contempo Casuals and
Pastille units, both of which increased losses. Store closings due to the
Californian earthquake hindered their performance.
Turnover rose to Dollars 650.7m from Dollars 617.2m and earnings per share
to 37 cents from 27 cents. For the first six months, net income rose to
Dollars 36.7m from Dollars 33.7m and earnings per share to 58 cents from 51
cents.
Mr Robert Tarr, president and chief executive, said the company expected the
usual net loss in the second half.

McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest cellular telephone service
company in the US, yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in fourth
quarter cash flow from its cellular operations, although the group's net
loss rose to Dollars 207.5m from Dollars 62.7m after charges for upgrading
equipment and early extinguishment of debt.
McCaw, which is being acquired by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, said the
number of cellular subscribers in markets where it owns a controlling
interest, together with subscribers to its LIN subsidiary, rose 37 per cent

Proportionate cash flow from cellular operations rose to Dollars 185.4m from

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hollinger floats parts of N
American titles

<TEXT>
Hollinger, the publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, owner of the
UK's Telegraph group, is to offer minority stakes to the public in its US
and Canadian newspaper chains.
Hollinger expects to raise up to CDollars 40m (USDollars 30m) from a share
issue by UniMedia, a wholly-owned subsidiary which publishes about 15
French-language newspapers in Quebec, and a number of North American and
European religious titles.
Once it goes public, UniMedia will also take over nine English-language
newspapers, mostly in British Columbia, published by Vancouver-based
Sterling Newspapers.
American Publishing, which owns about 230 small-town US daily and weekly
papers, has also filed a preliminary prospectus for a public share offering.
The terms of the issue, including the amount to be raised, are likely to be
decided within the next few months.
Mr Jack Boultbee, Hollinger vice-president for finance, said yesterday: 'We
don't need the money, but we think it's a good idea to get these companies
public when the markets are good.'
He said the infusion of outside equity should also help boost Hollinger's
share price. The shares climbed 25 cents on the Toronto stock exchange
yesterday morning, to CDollars 14.25.
UniMedia and Sterling had combined sales of CDollars 108m in 1992, while
American Publishing's sales were about CDollars 180m. Hollinger said
UniMedia would become its 'preferred' vehicle for the acquisition or
start-up of newspapers in Canada.
Proceeds from the share issue will be used to expand printing and production
facilities, and repay inter-company loans.
Separately, a labour dispute threatens to shut down two Vancouver dailies
owned by Southam, the Toronto-based newspaper group in which Hollinger and
the Telegraph each have a 9.4 per cent interest.
Southam management and unions representing about 1,300 workers have filed
lock-out and strike notices respectively after a mediator failed to settle
the dispute. The unions want assurances that jobs will not be lost to
contractors or through the sale of divisions.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: BNL finds itself back under the
spotlight - Haig Simonian reports on the surprise decision by the Italian
bank's chief to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's treasury-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro shot back into the
headlines this month after its chairman, Mr Giampiero Cantoni, decided to
step down temporarily.
Mr Cantoni was brought in to remove the bank from the limelight in 1989 when
revelations about Dollars 4bn in unauthorised loans to Iraq from its Atlanta
branch triggered an international outcry.
BNL has maintained a fairly low profile since then. Apart from a flurry
during the 1991 collapse of the Federconsorzi farm services group, the new
management, under Mr Cantoni, has steered a reasonable recovery at the once
scandal-ridden bank.
Parent company figures for 1993, revealed yesterday, showed a 68 per cent
surge in gross operating profits to L1,527bn (Dollars 911m), confirming the
bank's continuing recovery since the Atlanta affair.
However, Mr Cantoni's decision last week to step down temporarily has
catapulted the bank back on to the front pages. Although he stressed the
move was for personal reasons - Mr Cantoni is being investigated about
alleged bribes to accelerate planning procedures in a Milan suburb where his
family engaged in property speculation - matters have become more
complicated.
BNL has also attracted the attention of Bank of Italy inspectors looking
into loans made to the now-bankrupt Mandelli robotics group.
Among the companies Mandelli bought in the rapid expansion which largely
accounts for its plight, is a concern in which Mr Cantoni had a substantial
interest. Although the Bank of Italy has not yet reached formal conclusions,
the fact that BNL's chairman potentially faced a conflict of interest in
approving big credits to Mandelli has not helped the bank's reputation.
Matters worsened this week after leaks about other potentially questionable
lending by Efibanca, the bank's long-term industrial lending subsidiary. to
entrepreneurs, some now in financial difficulties and closely associated
with the now-discredited Socialist party.
Although Efibanca has rejected most of the claims, politically-influenced
lending is nothing new in Italian banking, where the majority of banks are
state-owned.
BNL is a Socialist stronghold, while Mr Cantoni is close to the party's
former leaders. Whatever the facts, the mere suggestion the bank may be
heavily exposed to entrepreneurs linked to the Socialists is highly
unwelcome now attention in Italy's mushrooming political corruption scandal
has shifted to the banking world.
The latest mishaps have led to calls for a management shake-up. BNL's unions
this week demanded a 'clarification' of the bank's policies.
The upsets have also refocused attention on its deeper structural problems.
BNL has for some years been under-capitalised. A November 1992 treasury
paper outlining the government's privatisation plans estimated it needed at
least L2,000bn to improve its capital ratios.
The treasury has done little to resolve the problem. Last week, Mr Mario
Draghi, the treasury's director general, acknowledged money had to be pumped
into BNL but he would not say when that might happen.
One solution would have been to merge with a better-capitalised state bank.
The two candidates frequently cited were Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the
profitable financial services group, and Artigiancassa, a well-capitalised
specialised lender.
However, neither option is now on the cards. IMI has been privatised this
month, while a marriage with Artigiancassa appears to have been eliminated.
Even the idea of merging with Milan's Banca Commerciale Italiana - always
less likely - is no longer available because BCI is next on the
privatisation list.
BNL's latest problems means it will have to repolish its image and further
improve earnings before the treasury can think seriously of such options -
let alone privatisation.
Yet the need to find a solution is pressing given the bank's size and status
as the the primary bank for the Italian state and public administration.
Another management shake-up seems virtually certain. However, matters are
complicated by the fact that Mr Cantoni has not resigned, although he will
not seek a further term after his contract expires later this year.
That may be too late for the treasury, which seems determined to impose new
management. The changes may also involve Mr Davide Croff and Mr Umberto
d'Addosio, BNL's two managing directors, who are under fire for not
controlling the bank more stringent-ly.
But any changes will not take place quickly. Finding replacements for Mr
Cantoni and the two managing directors could be difficult given the need for
executives combining both proven integrity with strong experience in Italian
finance and a willingness to take on the challenge of running BNL.
Any management changes will probably be accompanied by a slimming down of
its bloated 19-member board to reflect similar changes at other big
treasury-controlled companies.
BNL has to observe a 45-day notice period before it can call the
extraordinary general meeting necessary to approve a cut in its board of
directors. That means the move will only come after Italy's general
elections next month, which may confuse matters further.

acquisition

<TEXT>
Westinghouse Electric has agreed to the sale of its electrical supply
company for Dollars 340m, marking the latest in a series of disposals
planned by the troubled US conglomerate.
The company, with annual sales of Dollars 1.6bn and 3,000 employees, is
being bought by Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, a private investment firm which has
been an active buyer of businesses shed by ailing corporations.
Westinghouse said last year it was in negotiations to sell Westinghouse
Electric Supply to shed unprofitable businesses which it no longer
considered core. The price for the company is put by Clayton Dubilier at
just below its book value.
The deal brings to about Dollars 1bn the purchases made by the investment
firm in the past two months. At the end of last year, it paid Dollars 310m
for General Motors' Allison Engine subsidiary, and Dollars 300m for Du
Pont's Remington Arms business.
The purchase price comprises Dollars 100m of equity and Dollars 50m of
mortgage notes, with the balance in the form of bank debt, said Mr Alberto
Cribiore, a principle at the firm. Westinghouse will keep a 10 per cent
stake in the company, with an option to increase the stake.
Wesco distributes electrical products to manufacturing and construction
companies.
The investment firm said its policy was to strengthen the management of
companies it bought and run them as stand-alone businesses. Mr Charles Ames,
a Clayton Dubilier principle and former chairman of Reliance Electric, will
become chairman of Wesco.
Other acquisitions have included Xerox's Van Kempen Merritt, an investment
management company, and IBM's Lexmark International, a computer workstation.

Pharmacia, the majority state-owned Swedish pharmaceutical group, is seeking

home drug delivery systems, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
Pharmacia, due to be fully privatised this year, said the sale was in line
with its strategy of focusing on selected product areas.
Pharmacia Deltec had sales of about Dollars 100m and was a world leader in

196m in final quarter

<TEXT>
The Limited, the US clothing retailer that has been struggling to counter
poor sales of women's fashions, reported a 20 per cent fall in net profits
to Dollars 196m from Dollars 244m for its fourth quarter.
Turnover rose to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.3bn, partly because Victoria's
Secret and other specialty retailing subsidiaries did well and partly
because the group opened more stores.
However, this was not enough to outweigh the sharp decline in profit margins
at the group's The Limited and Lerner New York chains. Earnings per share
fell to 54 cents from 67 cents.
The final quarter's poor performance produced a decline for the full year,
pulling net income down to Dollars 391m from Dollars 455m and earnings per
share to Dollars 1.08 from Dollars 1.25 - although turnover rose to Dollars
7.2bn from Dollars 6.7bn.
The Limited said it added 198 stores last year and 1.57m sq ft of selling
space.

Nine-month profit advanced to CDollars 110.5m, or CDollars 1.39, from
CDollars 34.5m, or 48 cents, on revenues of CDollars 388m, a leap of 88 per

Teleglobe, Canada's overseas telecommunications utility, earned CDollars
75.5m, or CDollars 1.20 a share, in 1993, against a loss of CDollars 50.6m,
or CDollars 1.19, after special charges in 1992. Revenues were CDollars

New products and acquisitions helped Campbell Soup, the US soup and food
company, report a sharp swing from net losses of Dollars 121m last time to
net profits of Dollars 203m for its second quarter ended January 30.
The previous year's figure was hit by a restructuring charge of Dollars 353m
before tax, but Campbell said net profits in the latest quarter would still
have shown a 13 per cent increase without the charge.
Earnings a share were a record 81 cents, compared with 71 cents before the
restructuring charge last time or losses a share of 48 cents after the
charge.
For the half year, net earnings were Dollars 369m, a 12 per cent increase on
the previous year's figure before restructuring and accounting charges.
In the US, a new advertising campaign helped lift soup sales in the second
quarter, although shipments to the trade were down by 3 per cent because of
heavy promotional activity in the comparable quarter.
Biscuit and bakery sales rose 48 per cent, largely because Campbell bought
majority control of Arnotts, Australia's leading biscuit maker.
International earnings were boosted by the purchase of the Fray Bentos meat
products company last April.

<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has bought a 38.1 per cent stake
in Eastern Group, a US gas producer, trader and distributor. The deal will
give the Norwegians a foothold in the US gas market, the second biggest in
the world.
Statoil has been seeking to export gas to the US but has been unable to
obtain prices which would justify such a move.
'Acquiring the interest in the Eastern Group and initiating a marketing
collaboration with the company form part of Statoil's efforts to expand its
international involvement in the natural gas sector,' it said.
The companies have not disclosed the terms of the deal, but Statoil will
gain two seats on Eastern Group's board.
A gas marketing venture is to be set up through which Statoil will supply
Eastern Group with a minimum of 5.6bn cubic metres of natural gas over a
five-year period which would be sold in the US market.
Statoil will either buy the gas in the US market or swap crude oil imported
from Norway and traded by its US subsidiary in exchange for US gas.
The Eastern Group is considering going public and may seek a listing on
either the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the American Stock Exchange.
In 1993, the company achieved a turnover of more than Dollars 140m and it
sells about 2bn cubic metres of natural gas annually.
Industry specialists said prices for gas sold at the wellhead in the US spot
market ranged between Dollars 1.47 and Dollars 2.15. per British thermal
unit.
Last year Statoil lifted pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to NKr12bn (Dollars
1.6bn) from NKr9.9bn in 1992.

Zenith Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, has reported
a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 5m, despite strong television
sales.
The total fourth-quarter loss, including a previously announced Dollars 31m
restructuring charge, was Dollars 36m, or Dollars 1.04 a share, against a
net loss of Dollars 20.3m, or 67 cents, in last year's fourth quarter.
Fourth-quarter sales fell to Dollars 361m compared with Dollars 385m in the
same quarter last year.
Zenith recorded its fifth consecutive full-year loss, at Dollars 97m, or
Dollars 3.01, against a loss of Dollars 105.9m, or Dollars 3.59, in 1992.
The 1992 figures included restructuring charges of Dollars 48m and tax
credits of Dollars 16m. Full-year sales were little changed at Dollars
1.2bn.
The 1993 losses came in the face of a record year for the US television
industry, where more than 25m sets were sold. Zenith said dollar sales of
colour televisions rose substantially in the fourth quarter.
The company said it expected its latest restructuring to reduce operating
costs by about Dollars 50m in 1994.

<TEXT>
Sumitomo Chemical, the large Japanese chemicals company, yesterday posted
its first non-consolidated operating loss, demonstrating the depth of the
crisis afflicting the industry in Japan.
The company halved its full-year dividend to Y3 per share. Sumitomo forecast
static sales this financial year and would make no profit on the operating,
pre-tax or post-tax lines. The group warned it would need to sell securities
worth Y10bn (Dollars 96m) this year for its operating profits to break even.
The group, the first of the big Japanese chemicals companies to report
full-year results, reported a loss of Y9.7bn for the year to December 31,
compared with a profit of Y7.4bn in 1992.
Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 18.6 per cent from Y40.3bn to Y32.8bn.
Consolidated operating profits fell from Y53bn to Y36.8bn. The consolidated
results, which were achieved on sales down 8 per cent from Y1,018bn to
Y936bn, were flattered by a number of exceptional factors. These included a
gain of Y22.7bn on sales of securities, and Y5.7bn on the sale of property
in Osaka. There were no such gains in 1992.
Sumitomo also made provisions of Y15.6bn for currency losses, bad debts,
topping up the pension fund and the cost of disposing of plants. That
compared with similar charges in 1992 of Y4.7bn. Post-tax earnings fell from
Y16.3bn to Y12.8bn. The tax charge fell from Y23.9bn to Y20bn. Earnings per
share fell from Y10.09 to Y7.87.
The company forecast consolidated sales of Y960bn this year, generating
operating profits of Y40bn, pre-tax profits of Y27bn and post-tax earnings
of Y11bn.

Mobil Petroleum, the US oil company, yesterday signed a joint venture with
Indian Oil Corporation, India's state oil company, a move which sees Mobil
returning to India after an absence of nearly 20 years.
Like other large multinationals, Mobil quit India in the mid-1970s in
response to the autarchic economic policies of the government of Mrs Indira
Gandhi, the former prime minister. The liberalisation of the economy by Mr
PB Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has encouraged some of these
multinationals to return, notably IBM and Coca-Cola of the US.
The venture with Indian Oil Corporation covers the blending and distribution
of Mobil-brand lubricant oils through Indian Oil's nationwide chain of
petrol stations and other outlets, which have a market share of 57 per cent.
The partners will invest in a Rs470m (Dollars 14m) blending plant to be
built in the state of Haryana, near Delhi. It will go on stream in late
1996, producing 100,000 tonnes of oils a year.
Mr RC Parker, chairman of Mobil Asia Pacific, Mobil's regional company, said
the group was delighted to be back in India. Both Mobil and Indian Oil had
much to offer and much to gain at a time of growth in the region.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Troubled sector learns to live
with recession - Paul Abrahams looks at changes facing Japan's chemicals
companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sumitomo Chemical, like most of the Japanese chemicals industry, is
suffering the worst recession since the second world war. A high cost base
and strong yen, combined with a migration of the industry's customers to
other Asian countries, are creating a secular change that is making Japan an
impossible base for manufacturing commodity chemicals.
Most of Sumitomo's problems centre on the basic chemicals division, which
plunged to an operating loss of Y6.9bn (Dollars 67m) in 1993 from profits of
Y554m in 1992. Turnover at the division, which principally manufactures
petrochemicals products such as plastics, synthetic rubber and methyl
methacrylate, fell 13.2 per cent from Y422bn to Y367bn.
The division, like the rest of Japan's petrochemicals industry, is
struggling with a collapse in domestic demand, massive over-capacity and
falling prices. Nearly all petrochemicals groups are in loss. The industry's
12 largest manufacturers of ethylene, the basic building block of plastics,
are expected to report combined losses during 1993 of Y51.6bn, according to
analysts.
Mitsubishi Kasei, which because of its problems is to merge with Mitsubishi
Petrochemical, yesterday announced it would report a Y2bn operating loss for
the 12 months to the end of March. That compares with a profit of Y10.8bn.
The collapse in plastics prices has been particularly severe. Sumitomo
estimates poor demand from the automotive sector has driven polypropylene
prices down 20 per cent over the last 12 months. Similarly, PVC prices have
fallen 10 per cent because of poor demand from the construction sector.
Customers have been using the low prices of imported products - assisted by
the strong yen - to drive down domestic prices.
The petrochemicals sector is incapable of exporting itself out of trouble
because of the strength of the yen, according to Mr Yukio Murakami, director
of Chem Systems Japan, the specialist consultants.
Instead, petrochemicals companies are looking to construct capacity
overseas, says Mr Murakami. This week Mitsubishi Petrochemical announced it
was forming a joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell to construct south-east
Asia's largest styrene monomer plant in Singapore. That followed Sumitomo's
decision last week to acquire a small equity stake in Petrocap, a joint
venture in the Philippines which is building a 160,000-tonnes-a-year
polypropylene plant near Manila.
Meanwhile, Sumitomo's speciality chemicals division, which theoretically
should be less affected by the recession, also suffered last year. Operating
profits fell from Y49.6bn to Y38.5bn on sales down 2.7 per cent from Y512bn
to Y498bn. Nearly all the operating profits were generated by Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, which posted profits of Y37bn (Y38bn) on sales unchanged at
Y239bn.
The division's dyestuffs operations suffered particularly from cheap imports
from China and India, according to the company. The domestic market was
depressed as textile manufacturers shifted production to south-east Asia.
The agrochemicals business also had a bad year, as it struggled against
low-price competition from the US and Europe.
Sumitomo must be grateful that it decided to diversify into pharmaceuticals
in 1984. The business generated operating profits of Y37bn, compared with
group trading profits of Y36.8bn. However, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals expects
to report static turnover this year at Y239bn, and only modest profit growth
because of price cuts due to introduced by the Japanese ministry of health
in April.
To achieve its break-even target this year, Sumitomo is launching a
cost-cutting programme. It said it is willing to import low-cost raw
materials even at the expense of stopping production at its own plants. It
also plans to improve margins by reducing manufacture of low-cost products
such as PVC, dyestuffs and agrochemicals intermediates, importing them from
China and India.
In spite of its troubles, European petrochemicals groups may look enviously
at Sumitomo. If the Japanese group's position continues to deteriorate, it
can always raid the Y319bn unrealised profits on its securities portfolio.

<TEXT>
Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish pulp and paper group, has put two years of losses
behind it by posting a FM385m (Dollars 70m) profit after financial items for
1993.
The result, which compares with a FM192m deficit in 1992 and a FM950m loss
in 1991, was struck after a 27 per cent jump in net sales to FM13.06bn.
Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, attributed the improvement to
cost-cutting, the weaker Finnish markka, higher productivity and lower wood
prices. He noted all the group's divisions had produced better figures in
markka terms, in spite of difficult market conditions throughout the pulp
and paper industry.
The strong growth in sales reflected markka weakness and the group's
expansion programme. It acquired Tampella's forest products and packaging
operations for FM3.6bn in May. It benefited from increased sales from its
new Enocell pulp mill. The group partly offset weakness in European markets
by increasing sales to south-east Asia.
Analysts believe the result may encourage the government to reduce its
majority stake in Enso as part of the long-awaited launch of its
privatisation programme.
The group's consolidated operating margin amounted to FM2.99bn, or 22.9 per
cent of net sales, up seven percentage points on 1992. Depreciation rose to
FM1.1bn from FM786m, and net interest expenses increased to FM1.38bn from
FM955m.
Exchange rate losses at FM140m were FM60m higher than in 1992.

<TEXT>
Improving domestic sales volumes and a sharp decline in financing costs
buoyed results at South Africa's AECI in 1993 in the face of slow growth in
export sales and weak prices for its output. The Anglo American-owned
chemicals producer reported a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to R347m
(Dollars 102m) in the year to December 31 against R270m in 1992.
Turnover climbed to R5.97bn from R5.55bn, including exports worth R649m
against R643m, to leave the operating margin unchanged at 8 per cent.
Although operating profit improved to R467m compared with R432m, the figure
is still below levels five years ago. Financing costs benefited from lower
domestic and overseas interests rates and fell to R120m from R162m.
The group's extensive capital programmes and higher working capital needs
pushed net borrowings R116m higher to R858m by the year-end. A R75m
expansion project at subsidiary SA Nylon Spinners was completed in the year,
while spending accelerated on the the group's R270m joint venture with the
Industrial Development Corporation to make lysine, an ingredient in poultry
and pig feed.
AECI is committed to new joint ventures with Imperial Chemical Industries
(ICI) - which has swapped its 25 per cent holding in the group for a 51 per
cent interest in AECI's explosives business - and Sasol in a R400m project
to merge the groups' upstream and downstream petrochemical operations.
However, earnings growth at AECI remains hobbled by its 25 per cent stake in
loss-making Soda Ash Botswana, plagued by operating difficulties and a slump
in local demand for soda ash and strong overseas competition.
AECI suffered a R12m investment loss and is considering making a provision
of about R140m for present and future investment in the project which will
be set off against proceeds from the deal with ICI.
Attributable earnings, lifted by a R31m one-off tax credit, climbed to R237m
from R164m, equivalent to 153 cents a share against 106 cents. Total
dividend is unchanged at 58 cents.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Unitas still in deficit at
FM2.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unitas, Finland's second-largest banking group, stayed in the red with a
FM2.57bn (Dollars 467m) deficit last year and warned it may not show a clear
profit until 1996.
It is the bank's third consecutive annual loss and reflects the weak state
of the Finnish economy and high credit losses.
Mr Vesa Vainio, Unitas's chairman, said the group's result would improve
this year, but it would still be negative. 'In 1995 we expect to have left
losses behind us and 1996 should be a clearly profitable year,' he added.
The 1993 deficit was only slightly lower than 1992's FM2.70bn loss.
Group net income from financing operations rose by 27 per cent to FM2.17bn
due to the fall in Finnish interest rates and improved efficiency.
However, the benefit was wiped out by a FM500m jump in credit losses to
FM3.77bn. The latest figure was aggravated by a FM750m provision against
likely future write-offs.
Unitas, which is the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, said
corporate credits accounted for FM2.46bn of credit losses and households
FM251m.
The most problematic sector was trade, hotel and restaurant, accounting for
22 per cent of write-offs, followed by real estate with 14 per cent and
construction at 12 per cent.
'Credit losses are expected to decrease this year as the economic recovery
gets under way and interest rates stay low,' said Mr Vainio.
Non-performing loans peaked during 1993 and at the year-end totalled
FM6.84bn, down FM1.46bn from a year earlier.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canon, a leading Japanese camera and office equipment maker, reported its
first profit decline in seven years for the year ended last December, due to
the yen's sharp rise against the dollar.
Canon said that in spite of efforts to restructure its operations so that it
would be able to make profits at an exchange rate of Y100 to the dollar,
annual parent pre-tax profits plunged 51.5 per cent to Y37.4bn (Dollars
362m), due to Y1.1bn in foreign exchange losses.
The company said it managed to offset 80 per cent of its foreign exchange
losses by increasing its prices and cutting costs. But sales, 79 per cent of
which derives from exports, fell 2.5 per cent to Y1,036.9bn, while operating
profits declined 32.5 per cent to Y44.1bn. After-tax profits fell 49.8 per
cent to Y20.3bn.
Sales of copiers fell 5.3 per cent to Y315.1bn and information equipment
fell 6.7 per cent to Y106.7bn, but its mainstay computer printers rose 7.3
per cent to Y435.1bn. Camera sales plunged 20.7 per cent to Y132.6bn due to
price cuts amid the current downturn in the domestic economy.
For the current year, Canon hopes an increase in computer printer sales will
help its performance. On the assumption that the yen stands at Y107 against
the dollar and Y65 against the German mark, the company is forecasting a 6.8
per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y40bn on a 3.1 per cent increase in
sales to Y1,070bn. After-tax profits are expected to rise 8.3 per cent to
Y22bn.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc chief sees slow
growth in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's recently
privatised chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday expressed caution
about recovery in the group's principal markets this year, and said he did
not expect a substantial increase in profits until 1996.
Announcing a 36 per cent fall in net profits to FFr962m (Dollars 163m) in
1993, which was in line with estimates given by the company prior to its
privatisation in November, Mr Fourtou said that the economic outlook
remained uncertain and there were signs of stabilisation rather than
significant recovery in its principal markets.
Mr Fourtou blamed the decline in last year's profits on the recession in
Europe and the fall in prices of basic and agricultural chemicals. The price
of acetic acid and soda, for example, declined sharply in the face of weak
demand from industrial customers.
But despite the fall in profits and the difficult markets, Mr Fourtou said
the group had made substantial progress in increasing productivity and in
reducing debts. Net debt fell by FFr9bn during the year, from FFr33.7bn to
FFr24.1bn. Cashflow improved from break even in 1992 to FFr2.15bn.
The fall in debt was partly a reflection of the sale of assets, including
the group's 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf. Mr Fourtou said that the
strategy of selling non-core assets, which brought receipts of FFr6.1bn in
1993, would continue in an attempt to reduce debts further.
In 1993, consolidated sales fell by 1.4 per cent to FFr80.56bn. Operating
income fell by 12.8 per cent to FFr5.92bn, reflecting restructuring
provisions of FFr1.17bn. Provisions in the group's healthcare division rose
sharply, from FFr5m to FFr616m, reflecting the conversion of a site in
France and difficult markets in Italy and Germany as a result of the
introduction of healthcare reforms.
The decline in operating income also reflected the fall in profits from the
group's basic chemicals operations and its fibres and polymers division.
Profits in the latter division fell from FFr532m to FFr56m, while the
organic and inorganic chemicals division suffered a loss of FFr78m compared
with a profit of FFr528m in 1992.
The decline in these divisions was only partly offset by a 15 per cent rise
in profits in the group's healthcare division, from FFr4.96bn to FFr5.69bn.
Specialty chemicals activities also resisted the effects of recession,
maintaining profits at FFr559m.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Air France's tight schedule for
recovery - The loss-making airline has little room for manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Make or break time is fast approaching for Air France. Decisions taken over
the coming weeks at the company's headquarters and government offices in
Paris, and at the European Commission in Brussels, will determine whether
the loss-making state-owned carrier can recover and whether it can be
wrought into shape for privatisation.
On Tuesday evening, Air France's 42,000 employees were sent a letter from Mr
Christian Blanc who took over as chairman last October following the forced
departure of Mr Bernard Attali, the victim of a violent strike and the
withdrawal of government support for his rescue plan.
The letter contains outline proposals for Mr Blanc's own recovery strategy
and an appeal for staff support for his plan. The aim is to complete a
package of recovery measures by the beginning of March. It will then require
approval by the board and unions and be presented to the government. If, as
expected, the plan includes an injection of capital, it is sure to be
scrutinised by the European Commission.
The schedule is tight. But the financial position facing the French airline
leaves little room for manoeuvre. Recession in its principal markets and its
high cost base prompted losses last year of about FFr7.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
The company's debts are estimated at FFr36bn and its annual financial costs
at about FFr3.3bn.
'I hear it said that we cannot go bankrupt. That is false,' says Mr Rodolphe
Frantz, managing director, in an interview in the airline's internal
newsletter. 'It is in the current quarter that the survival of the company
will be decided. Never have we faced such a pressing danger.'
There is method in Mr Frantz's gloomy message. In the wake of last year's
disastrous strike, Mr Blanc and his management team have sought to convince
the airline's employees of the need for fundamental and rapid reform.
Warnings of the company's plight are part of the process. This has been
combined with the establishment of performance targets needed to rescue the
airline and the critical stage of designing measures to achieve these goals.
The targets are clear. In a statement issued last December, Mr Blanc said
that the airline must return to profit within the next three years. Revenues
must be increased by 14 per cent by 1997 and financial costs must be halved
by the end of 1998. Spending on equipment and salaries must fall by 7 per
cent and 10 per cent respectively in each year until 1997, according to Mr
Blanc.
Now comes the hard part - how to achieve these ambitious goals. Mr Blanc has
deliberately left himself room for manoeuvre on this score.
'The events of last year mean that he cannot reform by diktat' says one
French banker. 'He needs to co-opt the personnel and give them a role in the
recovery plan.'
The new chairman has, however, indicated the means that might be employed to
reach his ends. These include a series of proposals to reduce salary costs,
such as a voluntary wage freeze or pay cuts. Higher-paid employees might be
offered an equity stake in the airline in return for a reduction in their
salaries.
These proposals have some support from within the company. Results of a poll
launched at the end of last year showed that of the 35 per cent of the
company's employees who responded to a questionnaire, 51 per cent would
accept a reduction in pay to help the airline survive.
The idea of receiving shares in Air France in return for pay cuts was deemed
an attractive idea by 64 per cent of respondents.
Other proposals include a radical restructuring of the group's operations.
Air France's activities could be broken up into separate profit centres,
either along business or geographical lines, in an attempt to increase
accountability and efficiency.
'It is necessary to completely rebuild the organisation,' Mr Blanc said in
the letter to his staff. As in Mr Attali's rescue plan, non-core assets such
as the Meridien hotels group, are expected to be sold to cut debts.
Whatever the final shape of the plan, its success will depend on two
substantial hurdles - the reaction of the unions and the company's ability
to raise new capital.
On the first count, Mr Blanc has sought to reduce opposition through
consultation and by seeking alternatives to forced redundancies.
Plans to cut 2,100 jobs this year, for example, are to be achieved through
early retirements and attrition. But the fractured nature of the company's
union organisation remains a grave threat.
There are 14 unions at the airline, and the power of wildcat actions was
clearly demonstrated during last year's strike.
Even without industrial disputes, the rescue plan will mean little without a
strengthening of the company's balance sheet. The airline is adamant that
the government must play its role.
'If the state cannot give the necessary capital then the company will be
condemned,' says Mr Frantz.
The problem is the amount of capital needed, estimated at up to FFr8bn, and
the reaction that a substantial allocation of state-aid would probably
trigger in Brussels.
The European Commission is already investigating a capital injection of
FFr1.5bn made to Air France by the previous French government and has

A report issued earlier this month, which was sponsored by the Commission,
called for the end of state support for the European airline industry,
although it left open the possibility of a 'one time, last time' dose of
aid. Unless Mr Blanc can pull his plan together, there may not be a next

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P lowers VW and Fiat debt
ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debt ratings of the Volkswagen and Fiat groups, two of the big six west
European carmakers, have been lowered by Standard &amp; Poor's of the US (S&amp;P),
a leading international credit rating agency.
The downgrading reflected 'increasingly difficult' industry conditions in
Europe, said the agency, and follows the lowering of debt ratings for other
car producers including Nissan and Honda of Japan and BMW of Germany.
The ratings of Renault and the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France are also
being examined and have been placed on the agency's credit watch 'with
negative implications'.
S&amp;P has lowered the rating of VW's long-term debt to A+ from AA- (the
highest investment grade rating is AAA, and the lowest is BBB), while VW's
commercial paper rating has been lowered to A-1 from A-1+. Fiat's commercial
paper rating has been lowered to A-2 from A-1.
The rating outlook for Volkswagen was negative, said S&amp;P, because of the
extent of the group's cost problems and 'uncertainty over the adequacy of
its remedial actions'.
Fiat's competitive position was weak owing to the company's ageing product
range and high degree of reliance on the Italian market. The success of its
current new product development programme was critical.
S&amp;P said the increasing economic integration of Europe meant that the
automotive market was more subject to volatile cyclical fluctuations than in
the past. Long-term growth was expected to slow as markets approached
saturation, and competition was intensifying as national trade barriers were
eliminated.
Significant excess capacity in the European car industry was expected to
persist, due in part to the development of new assembly plants by leading
Japanese carmakers.

FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: SBC starts Swiss season with 36%
surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation has launched the big Swiss bank results season with a
36 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net income to SFr1.37bn (Dollars 945m)
 -well ahead of earlier forecasts - and a proposed 14.3 per cent rise in
dividends.
Following the news, the group's bearer shares put on SFr18 to SFr1,438 in a
rising Zurich market.
SBC's underlying net income growth rate, excluding extraordinary gains from
large asset sales in 1992, was a much higher 80 per cent, thanks to very
robust earnings from trading and commissions and modest expense growth.
Also, the previous year's profits were severely depressed by the costs of
reorganising the group's private banking operations and integrating the
O'Connor Associates derivatives subsidiary.
Last year's earnings growth was achieved in spite of the decision to set
aside massive provisions of SFr2.8bn, 44 per cent more than in 1992.
In common with all Swiss banks, SBC has suffered from a surge in bad loans,
especially in the depressed Swiss real estate sector.
The bank indicated earlier that it would be taking advantage of its high
profits last year to make provisions for every foreseeable risk.
SBC said that the provisions also included payments made to the former
partners of O'Connor Associates which it took over in 1990.
The group said its net operating income jumped 31 per cent to SFr9.2bn.
Operating expenditure rose 16 per cent to SFr4.7bn, mainly due to
performance-related compensation to certain employees, leaving profits
before taxes and provisions of SFr4.5bn, ahead by 52 per cent. Total
consolidated assets rose 3 per cent to SFr207bn.
After-tax return on equity rose from 7.9 per cent in 1992 to 10.2 per cent
last year and the directors are proposing to raise the group's dividends for
the first time since 1989.
The rate on the bearer share would rise from SFr14 to SFr16 while that on
the registered share would increase from SFr7 to SFr8.
As last year, shareholders will be offered the option of taking their
dividends in shares with warrants on terms to be announced at the annual
meeting on April 26.
The directors are proposing to create SFr100m par value of capital for
possible use in acquisitions or rights issues plus SFr150m par value for use
in convertible bonds and bonds with warrants.
Union Bank of Switzerland will report its 1993 figures next Friday and
Credit Suisse the following Friday.

<TEXT>
Shares in James Wilkes fell 6p to 176p yesterday after the specialist
engineer said that, other than recent speculation concerning the intentions
of Suter, the industrial conglomerate, it was not aware of any specific
reason for the recent share price increase.
The shares jumped 17p to 182p on Tuesday, but the company said yesterday
that it was not currently in discussions with Suter or any other party.
Earlier this month, Suter raised its holding in Wilkes to 5.21m shares
(29.53 per cent). Suter said then that the shares were for investment
purposes and no decision had been made about the next course of action.

investors and added that the recent successful GATT settlement would benefit
the property industry.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Trencherwood returns to the black with
Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trencherwood, the Newbury-based housebuilder, returned to the black in the
12 months to October 31 after three years of losses.
The company continued to suffer operating losses before exceptional items in
1993, but management is confident that 1994 will be a turnround year, with
significant improvements in profit margins and sales volumes.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.8m, compared with losses of Pounds
21.4m, but the latest figure included a Pounds 1.9m write-back of provisions
and a Pounds 1.24m profit from the sale of a subsid-iary.
Turnover declined to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 18.9m), but the cost of sales fell
30 per cent to Pounds 12.8m because of a cut in incentives to house
purchasers and a fall in construction costs.
The number of units sold increased by 14 per cent to 188, and Mr Richard
Brooke, finance director, said the company was targeting a 25 per cent
increase in unit sales during the current year.
He was confident that the cost of sales would not increase during 1994
because of forward pricing for contractors and continuing overhangs in
building material supplies.
In addition, house prices increased by an estimated 5-6 per cent last year
and Mr Brooke expected similar increases during the current year.
Trencherwood went through a radical refinancing in early 1993, swapping
Pounds 35m in bank debt and claims into equity. At the year end it still had
net debt of Pounds 26m, despite receiving proceeds from the sale of an
associate property development to J Sainsbury for an undisclosed sum.
The company is continuing to sell land outside its core area of Berkshire.
It disposed of Pounds 1.9m of land last year and plans to reduce further its
exposure to commercial property development.
During 1993 Trencherwood bought Pounds 2.3m of new land and at October 31
had a land bank comprising 6,912 plots, of which 1,500 had planning
permission.
Earnings per share amounted to 3.45p basic and 1.88p fully diluted, compared
with losses of 83.1p. The company is not proposing a dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In first day dealings, shares of Trifast, the Sussex-based industrial
fastener group, closed at 215p - a 15p premium over the offer price.
Some 7.87m shares were placed by James Capel raising Pounds 15.7m, of which
Pounds 12.2m went to Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts, the founders who
retain a 40 per cent stake in the company.
Trifast is expecting pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 2.55m for the
year to March 31. That would compare with Pounds 1.98m for 1992-93.
Mr Malcolm Diamond, managing director, said he was 'delighted' with the
take-up of the shares. He added that the listing was another step in the
development of Trifast, which was looking for expansion both organically and
by acquisition in the UK and abroad.

Fleming Fledgeling Investment Trust reported a 36 per cent rise in net asset
value, from 288.4p to 392.6p, for the year to December 31.

Available revenue declined to Pounds 244,000 (Pounds 471,000) and eanings

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pressure at core reins in L Wise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leslie Wise yesterday blamed a flat year-end performance on volatile trading
conditions in the retail sector.
Pre-tax profits at the the textile and garment group, which supplies chains
such as Burton and Etam, dipped from Pounds 2.52m to Pounds 2.47m in the
year to November 30.
Mr John Gowers, chief executive, said profits had been undermined by an
Pounds 89,000 exceptional charge to cover legal costs of an aborted takeover
bid.
Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 48.7m).
Nevertheless, sales in the textile division increased by 6 per cent and
operating profits rose by 22 per cent.
The improvement was offset, however, by pressure on margins in the core
garment business, due to lower volumes and rising raw material costs.
Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.76m (Pounds 2.84m). Earnings per share
declined to 4.74p (4.96p).
Mr Gowers said that in the current year 'we propose to continue to
aggressively seek profit growth through increased sales, internal
rationalisation and by acquisition or organic growth when appropriate'.
The final dividend is held at 2.25p for the second year, to give an
unchanged total of 4p.
The shares closed up 3p at 87p.

Herald Investment Trust, a new fund specialising in small media and
communications companies, has raised Pounds 65m through a placing.
The issue was up to 50 per cent oversubscribed after the size of the fund
was capped to allow manageable investment within its stated objectives.
The trust is to be managed by Ms Katie Potts, a former electronics analyst
at SG Warburg, now at Rutherford Asset Management. The company is best known
for its Pilot Investment Trust, which specialises in very small companies
with market capitalisations under Pounds 30m.
The new trust will invest in companies with market capitalisations of less
than Pounds 300m in the information technology, software, broadcasting,
printing and publishing fields.
Dealings in ordinary shares and warrants - attached on a 1-for-5 basis  -
are expected to start on Monday.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Alvis expands with Unipower buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alvis, the defence contractor, has bought Unipower, the Watford-based
manufacturer of specialist vehicles for the military and commercial markets.
Alvis, which makes armoured vehicles, is paying an initial Pounds 2m for the
lossmaking business, which it said had a complementary product range with
opportunities for growth in both military and civil markets.
Alvis shares advanced by 9p to 67p.
Under the deal Alvis will also assume Unipower's overdraft of Pounds 6m. A
further deferred consideration of up to Pounds 2m in cash may be payable,
depending on orders received.
Mr Nick Prest, chief executive of Alvis, said: 'Since the sale of our
European electro-optics business in July 1993, we have been looking to
expand our specialist engineering interests in the UK.'
Unipower bought some of the assets of the former Scammell division of
Leyland trucks in 1988 from the Rover Group, and its main products are in
the Scammell tradition.
In November, the company won a Pounds 22.5m contract from a subsidiary of
Rolls-Royce to supply the vehicle for the new BR-90 bridging system for the
Ministry of Defence. Alvis said yesterday the UK had historically been a
world leader in military bridging, and the BR-90 system had good export
prospects.
Unipower made an operating profit of Pounds 689,789 on sales of Pounds 15.2m
in the 13 months to April 1992. Since then overheads had been maintained in
anticipation of the BR-90 contract, which was continually delayed. This
caused substantial losses and by November 30 the deficit on shareholders'
funds was estimated at Pounds 2.4m.
Unipower, which employs 95 people, also has a 70 per cent-owned subsidiary,
Automotive Export Supplies, which principally distributes Land Rovers to
Africa, paid for by aid agencies. AES has an order book of Pounds 2.8m and
is trading profitably.
Alvis said Unipower was expected to return to profitability soon, with the
benefit of the BR-90 contract. The acquisition was expected to have a
neutral impact on earnings in the current year to September, but would
enhance earnings in the following year.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Auditors voice disquiet over HunterPrint
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in HunterPrint, the specialist printing group, lost 20 per cent of
their value yesterday after its auditors expressed 'fundamental uncertainty'
over the going concern assumption used in the accounts.
The shares closed down 4p at 16p after BDO Binder Hamlyn said: 'The group
meets its day to day working capital requirements through its overdraft
facility, which at the year end was substantially utilised.
'There is a material level of concern as to the appropriateness of the going
concern basis.'
In the 12 months to September 26 last year, the group incurred a deficit of
Pounds 3.2m before tax, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 12.2m in
1992.
Despite the apparent improvement, the auditors are understood to have
expressed disquiet at the group's growing borrowing requirement.
HunterPrint last year increased its bank overdraft to Pounds 8.9m from a
restated Pounds 3.4m, while at the same maintaining a Pounds 6m loan secured
against its Corby factory.
Although Barclays, the group's banker, has extended financing facilities to
September 30 this year, the loans are repayable on demand.
Mr Geoff Eades, finance director, admitted net borrowings of Pounds 17.9m
(Pounds 9.6m) were higher than expected, but said institutional shareholders
remained fully behind the group.
He said gearing had exceeded forecast levels because the group spent Pounds
6.2m on plant and facilities, including three second-hand presses.
The presses were purchased to ensure capacity for new printing contracts
with Associated Newspapers, Mirror Group Newspapers and the Guardian Media
Group, worth a combined total of Pounds 10m a year.
HunterPrint was also pursuing a cost-cutting programme expected to save
Pounds 3m, Mr Eades added.
'Wages and salaries have been cut by 10 per cent, and we will be looking for
further savings,' he said.
Large institutional shareholders, including M&amp;G, Fidelity and Standard Life,
said yesterday they were aware of the situation and welcomed moves by the
group to cut spending.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: To restructure and not expand - Tim Burt
looks at the changing nature of M&amp;A activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tracking takeover activity is an inexact science. Sheraton's surprise Pounds
353m bid last week for Ciga, the Italian hotels group, has bucked the trend
in the hotel sector just when analysts were predicting a quiet period for
mergers and acquisitions.
Such unexpected bids can undermine thousands of man hours invested by
leading merchant banks and accountancy firms to spot markets where companies
are ripe for the picking.
In the automotive sector, for example, forecasts of declining takeover
activity have been overtaken by BMW's agreed Pounds 800m takeover of Rover
Group.
Faced with increasingly unpredictable boardroom moves, merchant banks and
accountants have this year begun to concentrate on the geography of takeover
activity rather than the industries involved.
The consensus emerging in the City points to a sharp increase in joint
venture deals and equity purchases in the North American and newly emerging
markets.
In the US, ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement and
renewed confidence following the first year of the Clinton administration
attracted a wave of new investors who bought equity stakes worth more than
Dollars 34bn (Pounds 23bn) compared with Dollars 13.7bn in 1992.
US companies, meanwhile, spent almost Dollars 40bn on overseas joint
ventures and partial acquisitions, up from Dollars 22.5bn the year before.
Of the developing markets, KPMG says China emerged last year as the prize
target with overseas companies investing Dollars 15.2bn, up from Dollars
5.2bn, in joint ventures and equity acquisitions.
In Europe, however, activity slowed. The accountancy firm's figures on EU
activity put the value of equity stakes sold off at Dollars 41.3bn, compared
with Dollars 57.3bn in 1992.
Outright disposals fell more sharply, down from Dollars 42.3bn to Dollars
23bn.
An even gloomier picture has been painted by Translink, the M&amp;A adviser. It
said the total value of cross-border deals was at its lowest level for five
years despite a small increase in the number of transactions completed.
After stripping out the negative effects in Europe of recession and
uncertainty over Maastricht and the appeal of investing in emerging market
such as China, City bankers and accountants believe M&amp;A activity is
undergoing a long-term structural upheaval.
They say fewer companies can now afford outright acquisitions, especially
financed by borrowing, and there had been a marked shift to lesser equity
purchases and joint venture deals.
Mr Richard Agutter, senior partner at KPMG, says: 'Some companies feel that
100 per cent acquisitions should be avoided.'
He cites British Telecommunications's decision to take a 20 per cent stake
in MCI of the US as an example of this piecemeal strategy.
'Companies are being more cautious - it is no longer a case of simply asking
themselves whether they have the money to afford the deal but whether they
should be considering the deal in the first place,' he adds.
His view is echoed by corporate finance directors at merchant banks such as
SG Warburg, Morgan Grenfell and Schroders.
Mapping the trends for 1994, they share a common belief that M&amp;A activity is
being fuelled by the need to restructure rather than the need to expand.
According to Mr Piers von Simson, head of corporate finance at SG Warburg,
such needs forced BAe to sign a deal enabling it to focus on core defence
and aerospace activities, while also securing for BMW an alternative supply
of cars and components at lower unit costs than in Germany.
Further deals, he predicts, will take place as companies come 'under
pressure to create shareholder value by selling non-core divisions.'
According to Mr Guy Dawson, his counterpart at Morgan Grenfell, disposals of
such businesses will lead to increased activity in most sectors,
particularly in telecommunications, defence and the motor industry.
Yet the busiest sectors appear to be non-manufacturing sectors, with oil and
gas and utilities leading the league table of cross-border deals.
The growth of these two sectors has been attributed to new opportunities in
developing markets which were previously closed or where overseas investors
faced prohibitive tariffs.
At Schroders, meanwhile, Mr Richard Broadbent, director of investment
banking, says future activity in such industries will be dominated by large
corporate players trying to win a commanding position in their particular
sectors.
'Companies are looking five years ahead and planning acquisition and
disposals now to streamline their businesses for the next century,' he adds.
The merchant banks claim companies have learned - often the hard way after
making costly non-core acquisitions in the 1980s - that there are no
economies of scale in further diversity.
Their corporate finance directors are agreed: restructuring will prompt
fresh M&amp;A activity as large companies sell off non-core businesses, leaving
smaller competitors with little option but to merge to survive on the
international stage.
'Fashions are changing,' says Mr Broadbent. 'The last M&amp;A boom was due to an
over-availability of finance. The next upturn will be driven by an upheaval
in corporate planning.'

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Great Western Resources seeking Pounds 15m
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Western Resources, the restructured energy group that almost collapsed
in a fog of litigation more than two years ago, yesterday called on
investors for support with a Pounds 15m placing and open offer.
GWR is also planning to float in the US before the end of the year. The
company was one of several US-based energy companies to float in the UK
during the so-called 'gas bubble' of the 1980s.
Existing investors are being offered one share at 38p for every four held.
GWR is issuing a total of 40.9m shares, leaving an enlarged equity base of
126m. Some 72 per cent of the new shares have been placed with institutions.
GWR said it was confident that it had 'effectively dealt with the immediate
problems'. Funds were now needed to allow it to 'plan for the development of
the company'.
The group, under previous management, ran into difficulties when one of its
largest customers suspended payments after a dispute over contracts. It was
also the focus of unwelcome publicity over its controversial former chairman
and founder, Mr Dan Pena. Mr Pena, whose financial transactions with the
company prompted a rebellion by institutional shareholders and pressure for
his departure, last year won a claim for unfair dismissal.
Mr Gary Loveless, chief executive, said the proceeds of the placing and open
offer would be used to develop GWR's oil and gas assets in the US and to
invest in exploration in Peru.
Last year, GWR was awarded an exploration agreement in the Manon Basin by
Petroperu. Mr Loveless said the group intended to seek a partner to help
develop the bloc.
The exploration asset had been a particular attraction for institutions
participating in the placing, Mr Loveless said. All of the placed funds had
been raised through UK institutions, two of which were first-time investors
in GWR.
Some 10 per cent of the proceeds would be used to reduce debt, leaving
borrowings at about Dollars 62m. A refinancing agreement negotiated in 1992,
after the company breached several banking covenants, specifies that 10 per
cent of any equity issue be used to reduce debt. Before the issue the group
had gearing of about 65 per cent.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Drugs cuts lead to unhealthy figures -
Daniel Green reports on the forthcoming results from pharmaceutical
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's round of pharmaceutical company results will be the first to
show the effects of a full year of healthcare reforms in Germany, one of the
world's biggest markets.
Germany cut its drug spending at the start of 1993 and sales there have, on
early indications, fallen by about 10 per cent.
These reforms, as well as those more recently in the UK, Italy, France and
Japan, and those planned in the US, have depressed drug company share
prices.
Investors fear that government efforts to cut health spending budgets by
concentrating on limiting the drugs bill will slow profits growth.
Drug companies are already busy trimming costs. But they have not moved fast
enough to have prevented the drugs sector becoming one of the worst
performers in the stock market.
Share prices have underperformed the rest of the market by so much that
investors are now in the unusual position of evaluating their portfolios on
the basis of dividend yield rather than capital growth, as has been the case
for more than a decade.
This means that what happens to the dividend pay-outs in the results season
is at least as important as the pre-tax profits figures.
At Glaxo, where first half results are released today, the dividend is
likely to rise to between 8p and 9p, compared with 7p a year ago.
The company has a policy of paying a much higher final dividend, forecast by
stockbroker Goldman Sachs to be 25p this year, giving a yield of well over 4
per cent.
The range of forecasts for pre-tax profits is from just over Pounds 900m to
about Pounds 970m.
Shareholders are also likely to hear comments from Sir Richard Sykes, chief
executive, on speculation that the company will form an alliance with
Pfizer, the US drugs company. The two have had talks on collaboration ahead
of the implementation of the Clinton administration's healthcare reforms.
Sir Richard may also indicate how talks are going with other companies,
including those at the distribution end of the business.
Developments in the US will also be picked over in any statement from
SmithKline Beecham, whose full-year figures are due on February 22.
Tagamet, the ulcer treatment that was once the world's biggest selling drug,
loses US patent protection in May. The company's share price is already
sensitive to indications of the speed of the sales decline and of how fast
sales of an over-the-counter version will grow.
SB's pre-tax profits are expected at about Pounds 1.22bn, compared with
Pounds 1.12bn and the dividend rise should be about 1.8p to 10.4p, giving a
gross yield of more than 3 per cent.
Zeneca will on March 3 reveal its first set of full-year figures since its
demerger from ICI last summer. The company should show it has made at least
Pounds 600m pre-tax. At the time of the demerger it indicated that it would
pay a dividend of 27.5p. This would give a gross yield of about 4.5 per
cent.
Within the figures, there will be much interest over whether the rapid
growth of Zestril, a heart treatment, can be maintained. The drug should be
close to becoming the company's biggest selling product; and the company's
debt level should be coming down quickly as it cuts costs.
Fisons' results on March 8 should show that pre-tax profits have slumped to
zero in accordance with the company's profits warning which accompanied the
departure of Mr Cedric Scroggs, the chief executive, in December 1993.
The company is yet to appoint a new finance director or chief executive.
Indications that there has been progress on either search should bolster the
share price.
At Wellcome, where interim results are due on March 24, a cash pile of about
Pounds 600m provides a useful cushion against the difficulties the company
is having with its anti-Aids drug, Retrovir.
Recent drugs trials suggest that Retrovir should not be used in patients
that do not show symptoms of Aids even though they are infected with the HIV
virus. The publication of further trial results is likely before the
company's results are published.
The company's biggest selling drug, anti-viral Zovirax, should once again be
a star performer. Competition for Zovirax is emerging for the first time in
the shape of SmithKline Beecham's Famvir, but this will not affect 1993
figures.
Pre-tax profits at Wellcome are expected by broker James Capel to rise by 12
per cent to Pounds 360m (Pounds 325m).

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson refinancing plans for Quantum junk
bond debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson yesterday announced plans to complete the refinancing of Quantum
Chemical Corporation's Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of junk bond debt.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, acquired Quantum on September 30
last year, the final day of its financial year. The purchase price of
Dollars 3.4bn included taking on Dollars 2.6bn of debt.
Hanson is to redeem three bond issues on March 15 with a total of Dollars
900m outstanding, which were paying an average interest rate of 11.4 per
cent. It has already redeemed Dollars 1.15bn of bonds at the end of October
last year and bought Dollars 300m of bonds in the market. Altogether this
debt bore an average rate of 11 per cent.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the group would refinance this debt at
about half that interest rate, through a variety of markets. Hanson shares
rose 4p to 287 1/2 p yesterday.
When Hanson bought Quantum it said refinancing the debt would save Dollars
125m a year in interest. At the time of the acquisition it made a provision
of Pounds 132m to cover the redemption costs, which included the difference
between the actual interest being paid and the rate Hanson would normally
pay on its debt. Thus the high interest cost of Quantum's debt was not
responsible for the Pounds 87m swing to interest payable in Hanson's first
quarter results announced on Tuesday.
As well as refinancing the debt, Hanson has taken action to cut costs at
Quantum. It closed the New York corporate office and Quantum's three oldest
polymer reactors. It has separated the two sides of the business,
polyethylene and Suburban Propane, which now report independently into
Hanson Industries, Hanson's US head company.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: TDG quits Australia and plans expansion of
core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport Development Group has agreed to sell Transic and its Australian
subsidiary companies to Jamison Equity for Pounds 21.5m cash.
The proceeds will be used to expand TDG's European activities operating in
the core business areas of distribution, storage, transport and hire. The
withdrawal from Australia marked a further step in the group's stated
objective of being a first choice European logistics group.
The Australian companies are principally engaged in providing storage,
distribution and transport services on Australia's eastern and southern
seaboards.
Jamison, an Australian company with interests in manufacturing, retailing,
private medical services and stevedoring, intends to manage the companies
under their present names.
The Australian companies made pre-tax profits of Pounds 900,000 before group
finance charges in 1992, and had net assets of Pounds 20.9m.
Harris Distribution, a division of TDG, has lost out in its bid for the
contract to build and operate a distribution centre for Mars Confectionery.
The new facility, which will not be fully operational until late 1995 or
early 1996, will replace two Harris warehouses currently dedicated to Mars
business, at Elmdon, near Birmingham, and Heywood, near Manchester. The
group said contractual arrangements with Mars include compensation for the
possible closure of the two warehouses, which have combined annual revenues
of about Pounds 5.4m.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Write-off cuts Benson to Pounds 65,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Benson Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, fell from
Pounds 817,000 to Pounds 65,000 in the six months to November 30.
The outcome came on turnover up from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 12.6m and was
after interest payable of Pounds 267,000 (Pounds 269,000) and a transfer to
reserves of Pounds 763,000 to restore goodwill written off in 1989 on an
acquisition since disposed of.
Mr Richard Phillips, chairman, said that during the period much had been
done to improve the quality of earnings in the group's principal businesses.
Profits at the operating level, at Pounds 1.1m, were in line with
expectations and just ahead of last year's figure.
Since the period-end the company had formed a joint venture with Siemens -
Benson Building Technology Systems - and has acquired Diffusion
Environmental Systems from the API Group, he added.
Losses per share came out at 0.04p (0.55p earnings) and the interim dividend
is unchanged at 0.1p.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BAT unit estimates earthquake claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers Group, the US insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, expects its
exchanges to receive preliminary claims of about Pounds 400m from the
California earthquake last month.
However, BAT said yesterday that 'a substantial proportion' of this could be
recovered from 'reinsurance arrangements.
'While the earthquake losses are significant, the exchanges have more than
ample liquid resources to pay claims without disrupting their investment
portfolio.
Moreover, the claims will have no effect on BAT's reported profits, since
the underwriting losses only affect the exchanges. Farmers' earns fee income
for various insurance services sold to the exchanges.
Farmers has received 27,000 separate reports of loss and expects to pay
about 13,500 claims, with its personal (home and motor) and commercial
business equally affected.
BAT said fewer than one third of its customers buy earthquake insurance,
which is perceived as expensive. All policies carry substantial deductibles.

<TEXT>
County Smaller Companies Investment Trust is to raise more than Pounds 35m
through a placing and open offer of conversion shares and change its name to
NatWest Smaller Companies Investment Trust.
Qualifying share and warrant holders will be entitled to buy three C shares
at 125p for every two ordinary shares or warrants already held. On
conversion, one warrant will be issued for every five new ordinary shares.
The placing and offer has been underwritten by UBS.
Dealings in the C shares are expected to start on March 18, and conversion
will take place by July 28.
The trust is managed by NatWest Investment Management, formerly known as
County NatWest Investment Management.
The proposed name change is intended to reflect this.
Results for the period from July 1 to December 31 showed the trust's net
asset value per share ahead to 116.65p, an increase of 15.8 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 1.06p to 1.45p.
The board has declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.125p, as the
portfolio is being weighted towards stocks with higher growth prospects but
lower yields.

FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bingo side helps Vardon more than double to
Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vardon, the fast-growing leisure group which owns the London Dungeon, more
than doubled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 5.13m, over 1993.
The figures were boosted by a seven month contribution from the 10 bingo
clubs which it acquired for Pounds 6.7m in May, funded by a Pounds 13.4m
share issue.
Earnings per share jumped to 5.6p (3.5p) and a final dividend of 0.825p
increases the total to 1.125p (0.75p).
Mr Nick Irens, chief executive, said the results had been achieved with
'very little help' from the economy but that it had detected 'glimmers' of
recovery in recent months.
In contrast to recent comments from First Leisure, where Mr Irens used to be
finance director, Vardon was seeing good growth in spending per customer, in
addition to more modest growth in attendances.
He also pointed out that its Sea Life attraction in Blackpool had a record
year while most operators in the resort, including First Leisure, had
reported 'a dismal summer'.
The attractions division, which now includes 13 Sea Life centres, a Cornish
seal sanctuary and the London and York Dungeons, saw operating profits jump
by 53 per cent to Pounds 5.3m while turnover rose from Pounds 9.73m to
Pounds 14m. On a like for like basis, visitor numbers were up 3 per cent
while revenue expanded by 11 per cent.
Mr Irens said:'We were absolutely delighted with the performance of the
existing operations and the performance of the new development was well
ahead of expectations.'
In June, Vardon opened a Sea Life centre at Scheveningen in the Netherlands,
its first outside the UK, and Mr Irens said the attendance levels were
particularly exciting. 'They give us considerable encouragement and
confidence for future expansion of the Sea Life concept in continental
Europe.'
New centres at Newquay and Tynemouth will open this summer and Vardon plans
to open a further three next year, one of which will be in northern Europe.
In the bingo division, which in seven months contributed Pounds 720,000 to
operating profits on turnover of Pounds 5.4m, Vardon opened a new 1,700
capacity club in Southampton in September with another in Coventry due to
open in May.
Excluding acquisitions, capital investment is expected to rise to Pounds 12m
(Pounds 8.8m), which would leave it with gearing of about 15 per cent.
COMMENT
These results explain the heady rise in Vardon's share price which has more
than trebled since Mr Irens and chairman Mr David Hudd floated the company
less than two years ago. Through well-timed and keenly priced acquisitions
they have built two highly cash generative businesses which both produce
healthy returns from new investment. The early results from new openings,
particularly the Dutch Sea Life Centre, show the scope for organic growth
and the management 'remain alive to opportunities' in other areas. Assuming
no further deals, profits should reach Pounds 7m this year which puts the
shares on a multiple of about 20. A premium rating but Vardon still has its
attractions.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Back in fashion but with a different cut: Richard Waters
finds new currents in the latest takeover wave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a casual glance, it looks as though the US takeover business is back to
its old ways. After three depressed years, takeover activity in 1993 nearly
returned to the level of the boom years of 1988 and 1989. This week, cable
television group Viacom won the biggest contested takeover battle of the
1990s so far, taking on a mountain of debt in the process.
Takeover fever has a way of feeding on itself, as company bosses compete for
what is seen as a diminishing pool of attractive corporate assets. 'M&amp;A is
like the fashion business: it's certainly become fashionable to do it
again,' says the head of mergers and acquisitions at one Wall Street
investment bank.
The fees being earned by advisers on Wall Street also echo the sort of money
raked in during the last takeover wave. Fees for Smith Barney Shearson and
Lazards, acting for Viacom and Paramount respectively, have been put at
Dollars 12.5m (Pounds 8.5m) apiece.
However, the 1990s takeover market differs from the 1980s version in some
important respects. Despite the knock-about Dollars 10bn tussle for
Paramount, hostile bids are less common and acquirers use strategic
arguments to justify their deals, rather than purely financial ones. Few
people talk about the dangers of short-termism, a hot topic in the 1980s.
Another difference is that much of the activity is focused in a narrow range
of industries. In entertainment and telecommunications - or 'multimedia' -
and in healthcare a common theme is vertical integration, while banking is
undergoing a steady consolidation. According to one estimate, 70 per cent of
last year's takeover activity was in multimedia, healthcare and banking.
Besides these changes, there have been two other underlying shifts in the
M&amp;A business. First, the takeover market is no longer the place where
shareholders look first to replace poor managements or realise the value in
underperforming companies - one of its main functions in the 1980s.
Shareholders are more willing to do the job themselves.
In the past year, chairmen have been unceremoniously ousted from companies
as diverse as IBM, American Express, Westinghouse and Kodak. Prompted in
part by such moves, incumbent managers have become more willing to slash
costs and sack workers, or to break up their companies.
Some of the biggest corporate deals have involved companies spinning off
subsidiaries no longer considered central to their operations - American
Express's plan to spin off Lehman Brothers, for instance. Such unbundling
was the battle cry of 1980s corporate raiders.
It would be wrong to overstate the effects of shareholder activism, though.
Company owners still have a tendency to act only after the damage has been
done. 'The amount of value that was lost in those companies (which have
sacked their chairmen) before they took action was truly extraordinary,'
says Mr George Baker, an associate professor at Harvard.
The second theme is that takeovers (often dressed up as mergers) are being
justified on grounds of strategy rather than price: few acquirers talk about
achieving immediate financial gains through the acquisition of undervalued
assets. The danger for shareholders is that, while clothing their
acquisitions in high-flown talk, some companies could be overpaying.
Part of the reason for this shift is that many US managers, having spent
years working off the effects of 1980s' over-indebtedness, have begun to
search for new ways to expand their businesses. 'They have milked
cost-cutting - now they need to look at new ways of creating revenues,' says
Mr Herb Allison, head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch.
Talk of strategic acquisitions is loudest in the healthcare sector and in
multimedia - where telecoms, cable TV and entertainment are converging. Both
sectors are being reshaped through vertical integration, with producers and
distributors huddling together to protect themselves in rapidly changing
markets.
In the healthcare industry, a flagship deal was last year's Dollars 6bn
acquisition of Medco Containment Services, a big drugs distributor, by
Merck, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. This grab for market
share by Merck marked a radical departure and has left other drugs companies
groping for ways to respond. But it also led to 12 per cent earnings
dilution for Merck shareholders in the final quarter of last year.
In the multimedia industry, shareholders of acquiring companies have also
seen the value of their investments fall. Shares in Bell Atlantic, which is
buying TCI, have dropped from more than Dollars 65 before the deal was
announced to Dollars 54 1/4 yesterday. Viacom's takeover currency - its
non-voting B shares - has slumped to half last summer's level.
Investor concern has helped prompt a shift in the financing of takeovers.
Last year, on the back of a soaring stock market, acquiring other companies
for shares was all the rage. Viacom's bid for Paramount was largely
conceived as a stock-swap, but the financing changed - with banks stepping
into the breach - as Viacom was forced to raise its bid and its share price
came under pressure.
Many bankers, starved of asset growth, now talk more ambitiously of a return
to takeover financing, with its profitable arrangement and standby fees.
Against the background of a shaky equity market, and with a healthy junk
bond market waiting in the wings, leveraged takeovers could be about to make
their return.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Renault and Volvo move to end their cross-shareholdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's Renault and Volvo of Sweden are negotiating to dismantle their
cross-shareholdings in the wake of the collapse last year of plans to merge
their car activities.
French officials said it was necessary for state-owned Renault to 'regain
its freedom of action', although they declined to confirm reports that the
cross-shareholdings would be unwound as part of the privatisation of
Renault, scheduled for the second half of this year.
Volvo is also understood to be anxious to dismantle the cross-shareholdings,
established in 1990, to give it freedom to seek long-term co-operation with
other motor manufacturers, which it needs to help it bear the high cost of
model development.
Under the terms of the 1990 alliance, Renault retains 25 per cent of Volvo's
car activities and 45 per cent of the Swedish group's truck operations.
Volvo holds 20 per cent of Renault group and 45 per cent of RVI, the
company's truck and buses operation. The agreement, designed as a precursor
to a full merger, prevents both from forming alliances with other vehicle
groups.
Negotiations on unwinding the alliance have accelerated since a new board
took office at Volvo last month following the resignation of Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, former chairman and architect of the Renault deal. Renault and
Volvo have already dismantled several industrial projects and ended joint
purchasing and design operations. Earlier this month, Renault sold more than
half of its 8.3 per cent stake in AB Volvo, the Swedish group's parent
company.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said in a radio interview
yesterday that the separation was progressing smoothly. He compared it to a
divorce between 'two well brought up people. Both are withdrawing, calmly,
politely and systematically.'
Volvo is likely to reduce its shares in Renault at the time of the French
group's privatisation, and may further cut its stake following the sale.
Renault would gradually reduce its shares in AB Volvo on the stock market.
But both the French and Swedish sides said a divorce had not been worked out
and it was not clear how long the process would take. Volvo is anxious to
achieve full value for its Renault investment and is concerned not to rush
an agreement.

FT  17 FEB 94 / GKN bid 'threatens Westland strategy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, yesterday warned that moves to
restructure the company and forge overseas alliances could be undermined if
the engineering group GKN succeeded with its hostile bid.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chief executive, said the future of the Yeovil-based
manufacturer would not be enhanced either in management techniques or
military sales if GKN, which already manufactures armoured vehicles, won
full control.
The engineering and industrial services group launched a bid for Westland
last week after agreeing to lift its 28.3 per cent stake by acquiring 18.7
per cent held by United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters.
GKN, which has a 45 per cent stake in Westland on a fully diluted basis, has
offered remaining shareholders 290p per ordinary and preferred share, 354.8p
for each convertible preferred share and 208.3p for each warrant, all
payable in cash with a partial share alternative. It is expected to post its
formal offer document in the next few days.
Stepping up his opposition to the bid, Mr Jones said: 'Our managers are
encouraged to run the company with vision and courage. I'm not sure GKN can
continue that.'
He is expected to tell Westland shareholders at today's annual general
meeting, when he will take over as chairman, that the company is well placed
to win new orders in partnership with overseas manufacturers such as
McDonnell Douglas of the US and Agusta of Italy.
Mr Jones, who met Agusta executives in Italy on Tuesday, said: 'We have a
strong relationship and they want to stay with the people they know. We also
have a deal running with McDonnell Douglas. GKN would not augment our
ability to continue with such collaborators.'
The engineering company declined to respond yesterday.
Mr Jones, meanwhile, said Westland's two largest institutional shareholders
 -M&amp;G and Schroders - have reaffirmed their opposition to GKN's offer.
'They know the real value of the company is much more than 290p (a share).
Shareholders should stay on board to get the upside when we turn orders into
deliveries.'
Westland shares closed unchanged at 333p, a 14.8 per cent premium to the GKN
offer.

FT  17 FEB 94 / BMW and Rover seek Honda talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Teams from BMW and Rover Group, the German and UK carmakers, are understood
to be flying to Tokyo this weekend for talks with Rover's long-standing
partner, Honda.
The teams are expected to be led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman,
and Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive.
Honda has a 20 per cent stake in Rover and has made plain its anger at
British Aerospace's Pounds 800m sale of its 80 per cent stake to BMW. The
Japanese manufacturer has worked closely with Rover for 15 years.
However, Honda has indicated that its quarrel is not with Rover or BMW but
with BAe. It regards Rover as powerless to have prevented the sale and is
understood not to blame BMW for taking the opportunity to buy Rover.
Both parties are going to Tokyo to persuade Honda not to withdraw from its
collaboration with Rover and point to benefits in long-term tripartite
co-operation.
Mr Pischetsrieder yesterday vigorously denied rumours that BMW planned to
reduce the Rover product range.
He also repeated pledges that the British business would be run as an
independent operation, adding that aggregate sales of DM40bn (Pounds 15.7bn)
and the expected profits would offer job security to employees of both
companies.
Earlier this week, he promised 'considerably higher' investment in Rover
than had been planned by BAe.
BMW also said yesterday that it expected to boost profits by 20-30 per cent
this year, recovering much of the ground lost in 1993 when net profits
slumped almost 30 per cent, from DM726m to about DM510m.
The group forecast a 5 per cent increase in deliveries of BMW models, and
said income from the British business could increase earnings further.
Mr Pischetsrieder based his optimism on new models due on the market this
year, economic recovery in Europe and accelerating demand in the US.
A compact, two-door version of the successful 3-Series was expected to
bolster turnover, although production bottlenecks were currently limiting
delivery prospects, Mr Pischetsrieder said.
Further impetus would come from a revamped version of the 7-Series, which,
contrary to some analysts' forecasts, would arrive on the market during the
second half of this year.
Mr Pischetsrieder said that the greatest uncertainty for BMW stemmed from
unforeseeable exchange rate variations. But the board was 'well satisfied'
with the situation.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Nationwide ends tie with GRE to set up own insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide building society is poised to announce the end of its
relationship with Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance group,
and the setting up of its own life insurance company.
A statement from the UK's second largest society is expected within two
months. Nationwide must give GRE a year's notice of its plans to sever the
existing links, through which it acts as a 'tied agent', selling only GRE
insurance products through its branches, for which it receives a commission.
The move would be a further blow to the relationships that used to exist
between life insurance companies and building societies. It would also add
to the capacity in the life sector at a time when many in the industry
expect a shake-out.
Last September, Halifax, the UK's largest society, said it was ending its
tie with Standard Life, the UK's largest mutually owned life insurance
company, and would set up its own life operation. Most of the leading
societies no longer have ties with life companies, or have announced plans
to end such links.
Societies now want more control over the range of products they can offer.
Running their own life subsidiaries should be more profitable than merely
taking commission from a life company.
The final decisions on the form of Nationwide Life have yet to be taken, but
the most likely prospect is that the society would buy in expertise through
a two or three-year contract with a life company to help it set up a wholly
owned subsidiary.
Another option would be set up a joint venture with a life company, in which
Nationwide is the major shareholder. In 1990, Woolwich building society set
up Woolwich Life along these lines with Sun Alliance.
Discussions are continuing between Nationwide and two or three life
companies, including GRE.
The society is unlikely to follow the route taken by Britannia building
society of acquiring a life company, or to settle for a new arrangement with
GRE which would give it more influence over the product range. Last year,
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, went the opposite way,
saying it would end its relationship with Legal &amp; General and would no
longer sell retail insurance products.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Greece cuts Macedonia trade link in dispute over name and
flag
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece said yesterday it was suspending diplomatic ties with Macedonia and
would no longer permit the former Yugoslav republic to import fuel and other
goods through the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, made the announcement live
on television before the start of a cabinet meeting, adding that 'Greece is
forced to make its position clear with specific actions'.
The move came in response to domestic criticism of the Socialist government
for failing to wring concessions out of Macedonia in the dispute over its
name and use of an ancient Greek symbol, the Vergina star, on its flag.
Yesterday European Commission officials in Brussels were holding intensive
talks in an attempt to find a way of defusing the crisis. Greece currently
holds the rotating presidency of the European Union and its action is likely
to embarrass EU partners.
The Greek government was put out when the US followed EU member states in
granting official recognition to Macedonia last week.
The decision to deny Macedonian companies access to Thessaloniki could have
a serious impact on the Macedonian economy, already hit by UN sanctions on
neighbouring Serbia.
Mr Papandreou is under attack from his party's radical wing for not opposing
more strongly Nato's air strike ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. Mr Carolos
Papoulias, foreign minister, visited Belgrade this week to reassure
President Slobodan Milosevic that Greece would not weaken its relationship
with Serbia.
In the Macedonian capital of Skopje, the Macedonian foreign ministry said it
had been informed that the Greek consulate was being closed and staff
withdrawn. Mr Papandreou spoke of a decision to 'suspend the activities of
its consulate in Skopje', leaving the exact status of relations uncertain.
In order to answer Greek claims that Macedonia's name implies a territorial
claim on the Greek province of the same name, Mr Kiro Gligorov, the
Macedonian president, has offered to sign an agreement guaranteeing the
border.

FT  17 FEB 94 / West balks at UN call for more troops: Extra forces sought
to help monitor Serb withdrawal from Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western European governments yesterday shied away from a United Nations
request to send more troops to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The uncertainty over plans to reinforce UN troops came as Russia hardened
its opposition to Nato air strikes to enforce the withdrawal of Serbian
positions around the city, and the collection of heavy artillery.
General Sir Michael Rose, the British UN commander based in Sarajevo, wants
an immediate addition of 3,000 troops to help monitor the collection of
weapons held by Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government forces, supervise their
storage, and demilitarise the city. More than 30,000 UN troops are based in
the former Yugoslavia, the majority in UN-protected areas in Croatia.
The withdrawal and collection of all heavy artillery pieces must be
completed by midnight on Sunday, otherwise the UN commanders on the ground
can ask Nato to carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions.
British and French officials were last night reluctant to commit any more
troops, while Washington and London believed 'several thousands of ground
troops' would be required to act as peacekeepers once the city has been
demilitarised. The US has no ground troops in the former Yugoslavia.
In London, British officials said Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
had not yet decided whether to redeploy some of the 2,500 troops already
based in Bosnia, or send additional forces. A Downing Street spokesman said
last night that 'nothing could be ruled out', but would not confirm if a
decision would be made at a cabinet meeting today.
Mr Hurd told the BBC from Moscow: 'There must be a fair division of
responsibilities - we have carried out really more than our fair share.'
In Paris, Mr Richard Duque, the French foreign ministry spokesman, said the
government had no plans to bolster its forces. France, with the largest
contingent, has 6,000 troops in the former Yugoslavia, of which 2,000 are
based in Sarajevo, about 2,000 in other parts of Bosnia, and the remainder
in Croatia. The Dutch government said its 2,400 troops were more than
proportionate to the size of the Netherlands.
Military experts in London and Paris said any delay in responding to Gen
Rose's request would be seen as 'weakness' on the part of the west
Europeans, adding that reinforcements could be quickly redeployed from
Croatia. These would, however, have to be replaced to prevent Serb or Croat
forces exploiting a vacuum.
'We have to maintain the momentum,' an adviser to Nato said, adding that any
large-scale demilitarisation of Sarajevo would require tens of thousands of
troops.
In Moscow, Mr Sergei Lavrov, a deputy foreign minister, told parliament that
the Nato ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw artillery or face strikes was
'illegitimate and contradictory to UN decisions'. Mr Lavrov said Mr Yuri
Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to Nato, had been instructed to object to
air strikes if the guns were not removed before the deadline.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Health reforms to be widened: GPs faced with radical
extension of fundholding scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, ROLAND RUDD and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans a radical extension of the National Health Service
reforms, with all Britain's general practitioners becoming purchasers of
hospital services in the internal market.
Plans agreed by the Department of Health will force GPs to choose between
being fundholders buying services on behalf of patients from hospitals, or
delegating their purchases to a new administrator - a fundholder manager
linked to a district health authority.
The department also intends to provide purchasers of medical services with
improved information about the efficiency of individual hospitals by
introducing two new performance measures.
The government is determined to push the GP fundholder scheme, launched in
1991, to the point where all GPs will take part in the market for hospital
services.
One health department official said: 'The way to counter the two-tier
arrangement (in which fundholding GPs are said to have unfair advantages
over non-fundholders) is to push forward with the reforms.'
The introduction of such a system could upset the medical profession, which
has been promised that GPs will not be forced to become fundholders.
At present, when a non-fundholder GP sends a patient to a hospital the costs
of the treatment are met by the district health authority.
Under the new proposals, fundholder managers would manage the health
purchase budgets of small groups of doctors. Ministers have not yet outlined
the fine detail of the relationship.
However, in consultation with their GPs, the managers would aim to ensure
that the provision of services by hospitals is more closely matched to
demand.
The critical unanswered question is the extent to which GPs would be asked
to turn over decision-making to administrators on which hospitals their
patients would use, and which services would be purchased for them.
At present, 6,000 GPs in 1,000 practices manage their own budgets as
fundholders. They cover a quarter of the population. However, ministers
believe there will be a significant increase on April 1 when the next batch
is due to sign up, extending coverage to a third of the population.
One of the new hospital performance measures is an index of labour
productivity, which compares the amount of work done by individual hospitals
with the number and cost of their staff.
The other measure compares the length of stay in hospital for a particular
kind of treatment with a benchmark length of stay, and is intended to be a
proxy of the relative cost of treatment.
Both sets of data are already being collected and used on an experimental
basis. The information is likely to be made available to all fundholder GPs
and district health authorities.
The publication of the figures may encourage private operators to offer
services in direct competition to health service hospitals that fail to
increase output or bring down costs per admission.

FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BMW/Rover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be heartening for Rover to hear that BMW intends to invest more in
the business than BAe had intended to. While BAe pointed to its investment
in Rover at the time of the sale, in truth most of that money had come from
Rover's own cash flow. That limited the need for external finance, but did
not provide a long-term solution to Rover's capital needs.
Much now turns on Honda's attitude to BMW and Rover. If it withdraws
co-operation at an early stage, BMW will have to fund some early conversion
of Rover's models. Against that, many of Honda's supply contracts are highly
profitable, so a deal may well be struck. It is still possible that Honda
will join a tripartite alliance.
Assuming that BMW had to go it alone, however, Land Rover will require
substantial investment. Much of its cash has been diverted over the years to
fund the improvement in Rover cars. Land Rover's engines and gear boxes are
ageing, and need to be updated to take on Far Eastern competition. Capacity
at the Solihull plant must also be significantly expanded if BMW intends to
push Discovery and an updated Range Rover in the US. If Land Rover is
allowed to keep its cash, it can fund much of the need. Rover, however, will
require funds from BMW if its models are to be developed. The Rover 600 and
800 ranges may be rationalised or could borrow from BMW's 5-series. So the
largest investment decision will be on the small car. BMW will have to find
a large amount of money to replace the Metro and guarantee the Longbridge
plant a long-term future.

FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc's predictions have proved erratic in the past and it therefore
came as a relief that its 1993 results were only as dire as forecast at the
time of privatisation. The company warned last year that the chemicals
industry was experiencing its most difficult trading conditions since the
second world war. The 36 per cent fall in net income bears out the point.
But Rhone-Poulenc's appeal lay in its big exposure to the next upswing in
the chemicals cycle. The more worrying aspect to yesterday's statement was
that the company foresaw no significant profits rise until 1996, or later.
A higher dividend than many expected will help sugar the pill in the
meantime. Some of the financial ingredients on Rhone-Poulenc's balance sheet
should also work to its advantage this year. Lower debt, an expanded equity
base, and improved cash flow combined with the reduction in French interest
rates will significantly ease the financial strains. Bright spots, such as
the 20 per cent profits rise from North America, provide additional
encouragement. The FFr1.2bn of restructuring provisions taken last year also
illustrate how the company is happy to endure pain today to deliver earnings
growth tomorrow.
Nevertheless, a share rating of 38 times 1993 earnings anticipates a lot.
Rhone-Poulenc's experience hardly provides the most encouraging backdrop for
the next wave of French privatisations. No one pretended the privatisation
offers would produce quick returns. Yet few forecast just how long the wait
would be.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When economic statistics are dribbled into the market day by day, the result
is often sharp lurches in mood. When they seem to come all at once, it is
more likely to be be bewilderment - unless like yesterday they mostly seem
to point in the same general direction. The increase in unemployment may
have been a blip, but both manufacturing employment and vacancies are down.
Taken together with lacklustre retail sales and Tuesday's disappointing
figures on industrial output, the picture emerges of an economy whose
recovery has slowed since November's budget.
That need not be a signal for alarm but it does make another base rate cut
more likely before April's tax increases start to bite. At least the
inflation news is good on both the wholesale and retail price fronts. There
are some signs that pay settlements are starting to creep up, but December's
quickening in unit labour costs mostly reflects the fall in production
during that month. The equity market's 54-point rally since Monday night
reflects new hopes for lower interest rates. But the same data which are
encouraging such optimistic thinking suggest earnings may be insufficient to
support share prices if the cuts do not arrive.

FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Nerves of steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There must indeed be a connection between the European Commission's
imposition of stiff fines on steel producers accused of infringing
competition rules and its efforts to cajole them into cutting production. If
its leaked intention to fine was a threat, it failed. The fines have no
further use as bargaining chips since it will be up to the European Court to
decide whether to rescind them once the companies appeal. But the companies
have been so irritated that the chances of agreement on production cuts look
even more remote.
In view of its outspoken criticism of December's feeble EU agreement on
subsidies, some in the Commission must be quietly pleased at the coincidence
which imposed on British Steel the largest fine. Yet its share price
actually managed a marginal gain yesterday. Perhaps the Ecu32m fine simply
looks insignificant against group net assets of Pounds 3.7bn. Profits should
be spared a hit, at least until the appeal is decided. British Steel has no
more production cuts of its own to offer. But it would be wasting
shareholders' money if it paid for others to make cuts without first making
absolutely sure that subsidised competitors could no longer step into the
breach.
If that did ever happen, British Steel's low costs would almost certainly
allow it vastly to increase its European market share. Its strong balance
sheet means it can survive the subsidy wars better than other unaided
producers. But that is no reason for the equity market to rejoice, because
the costs will be high. The shares are mainly resilient for a reason that
will ultimately make the problem worse. Production restraints and the
prospect of economic recovery have buoyed product prices. The longer that
continues the harder it will be to stop the subsidies - which probably also
explains the Commission's extreme frustration.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Markets, yes cartels, no
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's belated crackdown on the steel cartel is rather
curious. The Commission, after all, has been a prime orchestrator of steel
cartels in the past. Nevertheless, if the crackdown is a genuine sign that
the cartel days are over, it is welcome.
The fear, though, is that the Commission's real motive is to undermine the
moral position of Europe's private steelmakers who have been highly critical
of the Commission's role in sanctioning Ecu7bn in state aid to their
inefficient public-sector rivals. Though the non-aided steel groups are not
blameless, that does not alter in any way the unfairness of last December's
subsidy package. Nor should it be used to blackmail the non-aided companies
to take part in the Commission's overall plan for restructuring the
industry.
Under this, the Commission wants non-aided groups to cut 19m-25m tonnes of
capacity to help bring demand and supply into balance. It is prepared to
finance a quasi-cartel to achieve this. But the private steelmakers say they
are not prepared to cut so much capacity, given that their aided rivals have
cut only 5m tonnes. While they are right to feel aggrieved, it is pointless
to labour the point. December's deal is done and cannot be unravelled.
The practical question is whether the Commission is sensible to press ahead
with its restructuring plan. The answer is probably no. Although the
Commission cannot reasonably remove its offer to sanction a
capacity-reducing cartel now it has been made, it should not be twisting
arms to get companies to take part. The Commission would do better to leave
restructuring to the market.
Painful process
Such a process would be painful. Without the prospect of orchestrated plant
closures, prices would fall. Some companies would be driven into bankruptcy.
Even that would not necessarily lead to capacity cuts in the short run as,
in many cases, it would be more profitable to write down a company's debts
and continue to operate its plants. This has already happened with Germany's
Saarstahl and Klockner-Werke.
One could hardly call such a process fair. Private investors would suffer
because of hand-outs to state-owned groups. But it would have advantages.
The rest of European industry would enjoy enhanced competitiveness from
lower steel prices. Some jobs might be saved because lower prices could
boost demand for steel. Moreover, when the time for closures came, there
would be a reasonable prospect that the most inefficient plants would go
first - maybe even those owned by state-aided companies.
State aid
Such a course of action could run into two dangers. First, steel companies
might be so badly hurt that they would clamour for more state aid. If the
companies that have already received subsidies from their governments -
principally Italy's Ilva, Germany's Ekostahl and Spain's CSI - asked for
more, the Commission's answer would be fairly clear: no second helpings.
But if other groups managed to persuade their governments to subsidise them,
the Commission would have a hard job saying no. After all, it would scarcely
be fair to sanction subsidies to inefficient steelmakers and then deny them
to more efficient rivals which were being driven out of business. The
Commission would probably have to apply the same formula of aid for capacity
cuts that it used last December. This prospect is not appealing. It only
goes to show the mess created once precedents on state aid are set.
The second danger is that market conditions could get so bad that the
Commission felt forced to declare a 'manifest crisis' under the Treaty of
Paris. German producers are already calling for this provision, under which
companies would receive quotas for each market segment, to be invoked. The
snag with such a cartel is not only that it would harm the rest of industry
by pushing prices higher. The evidence of the 1980s, when a manifest crisis
was last invoked, is that little restructuring would occur and trouble would
be stored up for the future.
Europe's steel industry is in such a mess that there are no easy solutions.
But some are worse than others. The Commission should rely less on cartels
and more on markets.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Personal View: Capitalist tools for Chinese workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY R. GATES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's embrace of 'market-based so-cialism' requires that its policymakers
turn to a new mix of policy tools for managing their economy. With more than
13 per cent growth last year, mismanagement could lead to economic
overheating and a 'hard landing' similar to that seen in 1989. As this
economic dynamo gropes towards 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', its
reformers should search abroad for adaptable financing techniques to ease
the way.
For example, to rein in 20 per cent urban inflation, Beijing is again
requiring that workers buy government bonds. The accompanying discontent
could be softened by allowing workers to swap the bonds for shares in their
employer. This would remove the need to pay inflation-fuelling interest
payments and transform the forced savings into an investment whose value
could be influenced by the workers' efforts. France's recent sale of
'Balladur bonds' offers a precedent, where purchasers were allowed to
exchange this public debt for shares in Banque Nationale de Paris or any
other French privatisation.
Such worker-oriented swaps could help motivate China's dispirited workforce
 -a key challenge facing both the old and the new socialism. Certainly,
worker ownership should cause no ideological nose bleed, even among the most
conservative members of the state council. Employees of state-owned
enterprises could also be allowed to exchange employer-held Beijing bonds
for a stake both in their employer and its suppliers and distributors. This
would help to foster a commercial commonality of interest similar to Japan's
Keiretsu-based 'communitarian capitalism'.
Likewise, where China's banks hold poor-performing loans, that debt could be
swapped for equity - akin to Germany's 'stake-holder capitalism' where
lenders often hold client shares.
With proper training, China's bureaucratic bankers could be transformed into
a positive force for economic reform. As bank-monitored companies grow
stronger, they could again turn to loans - to repurchase these shares from
workers via an employee stock ownership plan (Esop), a financing technique
utilised in more than 10,000 US and UK corporations. Esops could also
provide a market for foreign investors' shares, offering a means for
transforming foreign capital into politically palatable worker ownership -
while also enhancing China's appeal to those investors worried about a ready
exit for their funds.
Similar financial hybrids also hold promise. For example, due to a
propensity among Chinese to save, economic reformers live with the spectre
of a potentially inflationary currency 'overhang' (Chinese banks hold
savings totalling some 15 months' wages for every worker). The frustration
of the Chinese at the lack of alternative investments became apparent last
year in Shenzhen when a shortage of shares in a public offering led to a
riot.
Also troubling for reformers' efforts is the tendency of state-run banks to
funnel nationwide savings into urban locales, including speculative real
estate, starving the rural sector of capital. Encouraging workers to invest
in their employer is an obvious first step. As the next logical step,
residents in certain communities could be allowed to buy shares in companies
located in those communities. In addition to soaking up local savings, such
mechanisms would also provide local companies with a needed, non-bank source
of funds.
Such investment vehicles could mimic capital markets, but without the
absentee capitalist aspect shunned by socialist ideologists. Also, granting
locals access to mechanisms for investing savings locally can boost national
savings and dampen inflation.
Financial engineering could help replace dwindling provincial tax revenues.
For example, service-providers (electricity, telecommunications, etc) could
allow consumers to invest in bonds, with proceeds earmarked to finance local
services. Those bonds, in turn, could be swapped for shares paying in-kind
dividends (such as telecommunication services). Farmers holding state-issued
IOUs could be allowed to swap a portion of that debt for shares in support
services, such as a fertiliser plant, collecting in-kind dividends similar
to those paid by farmers' co-operatives worldwide.
China has a historic opportunity to design an extraordinary economy,
combining prosperity with political stability. Importantly, reformers could
ensure that China is owned largely by working Chinese. The challenges are
immense. Yet with financial creativity and experimentation, China can tap
the dynamism of market forces and remain true to its core principles.

FT  17 FEB 94 / The poor make their presence felt: Damian Fraser examines
the political and economic repercussions of Mexico's peasant uprising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seizure by peasant guerrillas of half a dozen Mexican towns in the
southern state of Chiapas on New Year's day has shaken the government of
President Carlos Salinas more than any other event in its five-year rule.
Since January 1 President Salinas has had to reshuffle his cabinet, fire a
state governor, bow to demands for potentially far-reaching political
reforms, and shift the focus of economic policy from conquering inflation to
boosting growth - all as a result of the revolt.
The Institutional Revolutionary party's (PRI) 65-year grip on power looks
less secure now than at any point since Mr Salinas took office in December
1988. Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate to succeed
Mr Salinas, faces an opposition rejuvenated by the rebellion, and possible
division in his own party. Elections are scheduled for August 21 and Mr
Salinas cannot stand for a second term under Mexico's constitution.
That a group of a few thousand poorly equipped guerrillas could wreak so
much political damage is a testimony to previous discontent with government
policy. The rebels, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation
Army, have elicited widespread sympathy with their calls for democratic
change, better treatment of the minority Indian population, and criticisms
of pro-market economic reforms.
'The Zapatistas are only saying what many Mexicans want,' says Sergio
Aguayo, a political science professor at the Colegio de Mexico, a leading
research institute. 'That is why they have had such a strong impact.'
According to a poll in the magazine Este Pais, 61 per cent of Mexicans
sympathise with the Zapatistas.
The army put down the Zapatista insurrection within a few days, but the
government, pushed on the defensive, felt compelled to drop its military
offensive and offer an amnesty and a ceasefire. Yesterday, the Zapatistas
released Mr Absalon Castellanos, former governor of Chiapas, who had been
held captive since the New Year. This clears the way for talks between the
rebels and Mr Manuel Camacho, the government peace-broker in the region. A
government official said talks were likely to start this week-end.
The government is likely to offer the rebels land and more money for
schools, roads and utilities, and to replace some local politicians with
those acceptable to the Zapatistas. It is unclear whether such concessions
will persuade the rebels, who are still armed, to rejoin civil society, but
they may undercut their popular support.
The government's conciliatory approach has helped restore the confidence of
foreign and domestic investors in the economy, which had taken a knock after
the optimism generated by approval of the North American Free Trade
Agreement last November. The stock market has risen about 7 per cent this
year, and short-term interest rates fell to a record low of 9.15 per cent
yesterday.
But even if a rapprochement is reached with the Zapatistas, the
ramifications of rebellion are almost certain to remain the central issue of
this year's presidential election. The uprising has shifted the political
debate to the extreme poverty in which about a fifth of the country lives,
and to the authoritarian rule of the PRI in many parts of the country.
Such issues are the main campaign themes of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the
candidate of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution. He has successfully
distanced himself from the violent methods of the Zapatistas, but appears to
be capitalising on the dissent highlighted by the rebels. Opinion polls
indicate his approval rating has risen to about 20 per cent.
Mr Cardenas's rise has put Mr Colosio, the hand-picked successor to Mr
Salinas, on the defensive. Mr Colosio has the hard task of convincing
Mexicans that the uprising does not discredit the policies his party has
been following for the past decade, in particular tight government spending
and the imposition of high real interest rates that have lowered inflation
but squeezed growth.
In an effort to boost Mr Colosio's campaign and appease public opinion,
President Salinas decided last month that the government would accelerate
planned spending this year, and shift budget priorities to anti-poverty
programmes. Last week Mr Salinas announced a Dollars 107m subsidy to coffee
producers who are angry at low international prices.
If Mr Colosio succeeds Mr Salinas, as is still likely despite the
appointment of his rival, Mr Camacho, as peacemaker in Chiapas, aides say he
will concentrate on eradicating poverty and reducing differences in income
within the country; devolve federal responsibilities to the states; and give
more powers to the Congress and judiciary, thus reducing the president's
influence. Mr Colosio was drawing up such a programme last year after he was
nominated, but the prospect of a subtle change in policy with President
Salinas has risen since the uprising.
Mr Colosio has been influenced by the downturn. Government figures are
expected to show that the economy grew by under 1 per cent last year, less
than the increase in population. Unemployment has risen in cities, and rural
areas such as Chiapas have seen a sharp drop in the prices of agricultural
products.
Low growth has meant that many Mexicans have yet to benefit significantly
from economic initiatives that brought inflation down from 157 per cent
annually in 1987 to an annual 8 per cent last year, and privatised hundreds
of state-owned businesses. While average wages have risen modestly in the
Salinas presidency, they are still lower in real terms than at the beginning
of the 1980s.
Over the past decade the large gap between the rich and poor has widened.
The richest 20 per cent of the population received 54.2 per cent of national
income in 1992, against 48.4 per cent in 1984. The income of the poorest 20
per cent fell from 5 per cent in 1984 to 4.3 per cent of national income in
1992.
However, both the present government and aides to Mr Colosio insist that
broad commitment to pro-market measures such as deregulation, privatisation
and economic stability will continue. Mr Santiago Onate, an adviser to Mr
Colosio, says: 'Mr Colosio believes in the continuity of what worked under
President Salinas.'
The government's freedom of economic manoeuvre is partly constrained by
membership of Nafta, which Mexico joined on January 1. The accord removes
tariff and non-tariff barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico over 15
years and thus puts pressure on the Mexican government to follow
pro-business policies that encourage companies to compete.
So while the government has little room to act in the economic arena, it has
decided to react to public pressure for political change. There are
widespread calls, encapsulated by the Zapatistas, for the overhaul of an
electoral system that favours the PRI over the opposition. The PRI decides
who will sit on the electoral tribunals which rule on the legitimacy of
elections. It also outspends the opposition through its privileged access to
state and private sector resources, and enjoys favourable coverage on the
country's two private television networks.
Backed by all the main opposition parties, the government plans to allow the
opposition to veto members of the electoral tribunals, require the private
television companies to give equal time to the opposition, and reduce
statutory limits on campaign spending per party from Dollars 215m to Dollars
42m for the whole election, as well as to outlaw the use of state funds in
campaigns.
These changes followed the replacement of Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido,
the hardline interior minister, with Mr Jorge Carpizo, the respected former
attorney-general in January. Mr Carpizo, who assumes overall responsibility
for the management of the elections, said when appointed that he was not a
member of the PRI, and staked his reputation on ensuring the political
reform agreement holds firm.
Mr Camacho says electoral reform is a prerequisite for solving the conflict
in Chiapas, since it meets rebel demands for greater democracy. Still, the
details have to be negotiated, and Mr Carpizo's commitment notwithstanding,
talks between the political parties could yet break down.
Mr Cardenas's party warns that, if political reforms are not undertaken and
this August's election is not free, then much of the country may be
convulsed by upheaval. 'If the government doesn't keep to the reforms,
things will get much worse,' says Mr Ricardo Pascoe, a close aide to Mr
Cardenas. 'We will go back on the warpath.'

<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke wanted to be chancellor of the exchequer. Now he is
learning how difficult the job can be. It was relatively easy to know what
to do after sterling had been pushed out of the exchange rate mechanism in
September 1992: interest rates had to be cut and the budget had to be
tightened. Today, policy judgment is more finely balanced, with the tax
burden about to increase sharply, the base rate of interest down to 5 1/4
per cent and the economy enjoying a modest recovery and falling inflation.
Inflation continues to look more than satisfactory. The retail price index,
less mortgage interest payments, is up only 2.8 per cent over the 12 months
to January 1994, after a 0.4 per cent fall in the latest month. This was a
substantially better outcome than generally expected and came despite the
budget increases in excise duties. One explanation was heavy discounting in
the January sales. But producer output prices - excluding both the volatile
food category and tax-distorted beverages, tobacco and petroleum - rose not
at all in January and by only 2.6 per cent over the 12 months to January.
This was a remarkable performance following a substantial devaluation.
Good performance
Meanwhile, underlying annual inflation of earnings has been running at 3 per
cent for four months. This ought to be consistent with price inflation of
less than 2 per cent, which would be within the government's inflation
target for the end of this parliament. The question is whether pay inflation
can stay so low. Worries include a small rise in pay settlements this year
and the probably transient effects of the government's tough pay policies
for the public sector. Nevertheless, inflation performance is good. So it
must remain, since it is important that a target is actually met, for once.
If performance on inflation looks good, that on the recovery is decidedly
mixed. The volume of retail sales - up 3.5 per cent in the year to January
1994 - has been growing more rapidly than output of manufacturing, up only
2.2 per cent in the year to December 1993. Meanwhile, the volume of exports,
excluding oil and erratics, is estimated to have fallen by  1/2 per cent
between the three months ending November 1992 and the same period of 1993,
although the volume of comparable imports was up 4 1/2 per cent. All too
typically, the unit values of these exports rose by 11 per cent.
This, then, has all the appearance of an unbalanced consumer-led recovery,
with export prices pushed up to take advantage of devaluation and weak
performance of both exports and manufacturing, despite the devaluation.
Tail off
Prospects are made worse by the high increases in earnings within
manufacturing industry, running at 4 1/4 per cent. The annual rate of
productivity increase in manufacturing has also halved since last July. As a
result, unit costs in manufacturing, which fell 1.7 per cent in the year to
the three months ending in July 1993, rose by 0.8 per cent in the year to
the three months ending in December.
Exports may still improve when the recession in continental Europe comes to
an end. Meanwhile, the importance of price cutting for sustaining the growth
of retail sales demonstrates that domestic consumption is hardly running
away. The growth of consumption may also tail off when the reality of
April's tax increases dawns on the population. If so, the pattern of demand
would begin to look far better balanced.
Demand may also prove disappointing. It would be wrong to get too excited
over one month's small jump in unemployment, particularly after four months
of decline. But account does need to be taken of the shift from full to
part-time employment, which is hidden in the aggregate figures. The overall
impression is that the economy is not growing fast enough to tighten overall
capacity by very much. If so, unemployment will continue to remain higher
than is necessary to contain inflation.
On balance, the evidence presented by the veritable avalanche of statistics
of the last few days suggests that further loosening of monetary policy may
well be required. Lower interest rates are likely and, as happened earlier
in the US, should prove consistent with still lower inflation.

Smythson, the Queen's Bond Street stationers, has taken Observer to task for
suggesting that dropping the 'man' from its Businessman's Organiser was done
for reasons of political correctness. To prove that the firm has not
completely bowed to the PC lobby, managing director Sarah Elton has sent
round a copy of Smythson's wafer address book entitled Blondes, Brunettes
and Redheads.
It would make an ideal thank you present for a man-about-town like Alan

John Prescott, Labour's shadow employment secretary, has always been a bit
special. When Observer was a ship's steward on the cross-Channel ferries in
the 1960s, Prescott and his colleagues, criss-crossing the Atlantic serving
gin and tonics on Cunard liners, were regarded with awe.
Those were the days before seamen's strikes, when Cunard's catering staff
were reputed to chuck the washing-up overboard if it was piling up too
quickly in the galley. No doubt Prescott never took such short cuts, but he
admits, in an interview in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, that he was twice
charged with mutiny.
Indeed, he claims that his mutinous activities led to a change in the
regulations. 'If you are caught with a woman passenger, you are no longer
charged with broaching ship's cargo,' boasts Prescott.
Unfortunately, Cunard does not agree with its ex-employee's version of
events. 'Not only do we not treat passengers as cargo, but only officers are
allowed to mingle with passengers,' says Cunard.
Back in your bunk, Prescott.

Black mark or black tie? Economists, it seems, merit one and not the other.
Social highlights of the Gilt-Edged Market-Makers Association's spring
season include a black tie dinner with the governor of the Bank of England
and another with the chancellor of the exchequer.
'There will be one guest from each GEMM (gilt-edged market maker); your
representative should be a senior practitioner, not an economist, and the
intention is to have an open discussion on matters affecting the gilt
market,' says Euan Harkness, Gemma's chairman, in his invitation to members.
Surely it is not the chancellor who is insisting on keeping the teenage
scribblers out?

How come John Major didn't include a doctor in his team for Moscow? Given
that there has been so much speculation about the health of Russia's
President Yeltsin, it might have been helpful if the PM's quack was on hand,
especially since Yeltsin is not going to have any more foreign visitors for
several months to come.
In the good old communist days, foreign governments often seemed more
interested in how long Russia's leaders would last physically rather than
politically.
When Harold Wilson visited the Kremlin in the 1960s, he took along his
personal physician with the sole aim of getting an arm's-length diagnosis of
whether Andre Gromyko, Russia's foreign minister, was nearing the end of his
innings.
Sadly, the only thing that Wilson's doctor could conclude was that there was
something wrong with Gromyko's jaw.

Late news flash from the pass-the-buck department. The Department of Trade
and Industry has admitted that it underestimated the number of companies
entering administration under UK insolvency law by more than half in the
first six months of last year.
However, the DTI is spared any real embarrassment because such official
figures are now released through the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce. Indeed, when it owned up to getting its facts and figures wrong,
it suggested that the real blame should not lie with itself or the ABCC, but
Companies House. Once part of the DTI, Companies House is now a Next Steps
agency and expected to take responsibility for itself.
How convenient.

Don't cry for John Major, Britain's unpopular leader. On a scale of one to
10, his party's sex scandals hardly get on the score sheet when compared
with the brouhaha surrounding the first entry of Brazil's President Itamar
Franco in Rio de Janeiro's recent carnival.
Franco's problems started when Lilian Ramos, an actress and Playboy model,
managed to sneak into the president's box during the parade. The couple were
obviously taken with each other, since they were soon exchanging glances,
kisses and phone numbers.
Unfortunately for the president, a 63-year-old divorced father of two,
several photographers had already spotted that Ramos was even more scantily
clad than some other carnival-goers. 'When I took my panties off I didn't
know I was going to meet the president,' admitted the publicity-hungry samba
dancer.
Apparently unaware of the shocking photos which were about to appear in the
Brazilian papers, the president phoned his new-found friend on Monday, only
to find later that his calls had been taped in the presence of journalists -
who make The Sun's newshounds look like angels . . .
Carnival is a time when normal rules of behaviour are broken in Brazil.
However, the Catholic church said that the spectacle of the country's head
of state dallying with the dancer was doubly regrettable because it occurred
on the eve of a national campaign to encourage family values.

<TEXT>
The UK tax increases which come into effect in 1994-95 are under fire for
their possible effect on the pace of economic recovery. But whatever one
thinks of their timing, their ultimate cause is the growth in public
spending.
This growth is international. Total general government outlays among
European countries have risen from 35 per cent of gross domestic product in
1970 to more than 50 per cent in the early 1990s, much larger than in the
UK.
Pressures have arisen both from the numerator (public expenditure) and the
denominator (GDP). The latter has been hit by the long-term international
slowdown in growth. But there has been at least as much pressure from the
numerator, which is mainly welfare expenditure. The influences have included
expensive advances in medical technology and growing proportions in further
education. On the social security side there have been improved benefits
(although not very recently), demographic shifts and changed social
attitudes to take-up. Indeed the line between being less inhibited about
exercising citizen rights and scrounging on the state is notoriously
difficult to draw.
One popular view is that the rise in welfare spending has been due to
unemployment. This is not so, at least in the UK, if unemployment is
conventionally defined - an important qualification. The biggest increases
have been in expenditure on pensions, the sick, the disabled and families.
Another favourite culprit is the ageing of the population. Again this is
much exaggerated. Look at the age-dependency ratio - the proportion of the
population over 65 to those of working age. In the European Union this ratio
did not change at all in the 1980s and is expected to rise by a couple of
percentage points to 23.6 per cent in the course of the 1990s. The big
increases are expected next century. By 2040 the EC dependency ratio is
expected to be about 43 per cent.
These pressures will not really hit the UK until after 2010. A superficial
case can be made that the welfare state is not a problem for Britain this
decade. Looking ahead to 2000, the Department of Social Security has made a
central assumption that benefits will rise by just over 2 1/2 per cent a
year - within a hair's breadth of the government's projection for economic
growth.
A much more immediate threat than the projected ageing of the population
later in the 21st century is the fall already taking place in the proportion
of people, and especially men, still at work in the 55-64 age range. It has
been stark enough in the UK but even more pronounced in many other
countries. Workers in that age group are being nudged into early retirement
during periods of recession, never to return to work during the upturn.
David Willetts, who has drawn attention to this and many other problems in a
Social Market Foundation booklet, The Age of Entitlement, expects the
proportion at work in this age group to fall below 60 per cent. The problem
is aggravated by the trend towards starting work later under the name of
education and training. Within the space of two decades, says Willetts, the
normal span of a man's working life will have dropped by nearly a third.
Survey evidence suggests that most of those concerned do not regard
themselves as either retired or conventionally unemployed. The problem has
been aggravated by the convention that workers should retire at top pay
rates and the provision in so many occupational schemes for pensions to be
based on the last few years of working life. This makes workers themselves
reluctant to stay in their posts when they may be earning somewhat less than
at their peak. For employers, early retirement or voluntary redundancy seems
a painless way of dealing with overmanning and reducing their average salary
bill. But in both human and economic terms it is a colossal waste; and the
increase in the proportion of women at work is but a mitigating factor.
In an otherwise illuminating Rowntree Foundation study, The Future of the
Welfare State, John Hills plays down the expenditure pressures. He looks at
the prospective ageing of the population in the next century, the maturing
of the much-reduced state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), and the
switch, advocated by Labour, to restoring the link between benefit levels
and incomes, and not just prices. If all these things were done, Hills
argues that the pressure on public finances would still only rise by 5
percentage points of GDP by 2040.
This argument has become much less convincing on its own terms since the
outcry over the plans in the Lamont and Clarke Budgets to take an extra 3
percentage points of household incomes in tax over 1994-95. Hills argues
that voters will not feel the pain of his 5 percentage-point increment if it
is imposed in small annual steps. This is specious. He might equally argue
that it would not matter if the state taxed away all original income so long
as the 100 per cent point was reached in very gradual steps.
The welfare state was once described by Winston Churchill as a ladder and a
safety net. The ladder represented opportunity and the safety net security.
Now, in too many countries, the safety net looks ripped and the ladder
shaky. As for the leakages, you only have to take a walk in the great cities
of Europe and North America. While some of the homeless and the hopeless
represent problems of drug addiction or mental disturbance not easily cured
by overall financial action, there are plenty of signs of benefits of a
minimum subsistence kind not getting through to those who obviously need
them. The British government cut benefits for the under-25s in order to
discourage them from leaving home without proper job or training prospects.
Many still leave home for understandable reasons and live on the margins of
society.
The shakiness of the ladder has been much discussed in the shape of the
unemployment and poverty traps. Many of the aims of welfare state reformers
get in each other's way. If governments try to make benefits more selective,
this means that there will be a high rate of cut-off and the gain from
taking a job or moving to a better one will be exiguous. If, on the other
hand, governments concentrate on reducing the high 'poverty tax' rates at
the bottom of the income scale, then much of the benefit will spill over to
those who do not need it.
The balance to be struck will vary from one benefit to another. In the UK
high priority should be given to extending Family Benefit - now available to
low-earning families with children - to those without children. This would
on paper mean that it was always worthwhile to take a job. But in practice
it will also be necessary to reduce the withdrawal rate for Income Support
from its present anachronistic 100 per cent.
When it comes to pensioners, the balance of argument is overwhelmingly on
the side of selectivity, as the careful balancing of different incentive
effects no longer applies. As Willetts remarks, several hundred million
pounds to improve the Income Support that tops up the pensions for the
minority of the elderly who need it will do far more good than billions
spent in a wasteful, across-the-board increase in the basic pension rate.
Yet Labour still persists in this primitive error. John Major himself has
made a similar error in relation to Child Benefit, which is a wasteful form
of churning between families. The sums would be much better used in
improving income-related benefits and increasing their take-up.
Different benefits and systems of payment have their embattled supporters.
Instead, we should concentrate on what is transferred to whom and on what
terms. Then at least we will be posing the right questions, even if there
are no uniquely right answers to find.

THE BRITISH BREWING INDUSTRY 1830-1980 By TR Gourvish and RG Wilson
Cambridge University Press, Pounds 50, 690 pages
The UK's brewing industry, beers and pubs are firmly established elements of
the national culture. They have survived - as this sweep through 150 years
of history shows - persistently high taxation, frequent ham-fisted
government intervention, periodic bouts of temperance, and constantly
shifting consumer demands.
They have endured recession, uncertainty and upheaval - not least in the
past five years - and, by and large, have done so profitably.
In the process, the industry has changed substantially, and at an
ever-increasing pace. But its basic importance in the social and economic
life of the country remains unaltered.
So do its problems. Complaints about the price of beer, brewers' profits and
control of pubs stimulated government action in 1830, just as it did with
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry in 1989.
In 1830, Wellington's Tory government courted popularity by repealing the
duty on beer and allowing any ratepayer prepared to pay a 2 guinea licence
fee to brew and sell beer. More than 24,000 beer houses were opened within
six months. Eight years later, nearly 46,000 had been added to the 51,000
previously licensed premises.
The beer houses were a fertile source for many an anti-drink sermon over the
next 40 years, but their proliferation did little to increase competition.
Commercial brewers were soon supplying them and later took over almost any
house they wanted.
There is little evidence in this dense book to suggest government
intervention has ever had any significant, lasting effect on the industry.
Licensing laws and duty imposts did create conflict and uncertainty from
time to time. The Licensing Bill of 1907, introduced by a 'teetotal-ridden'
Liberal government, caused uproar. Investment in breweries was cancelled and
dividend payments suspended. Sir Gilbert Greenall, the Lancashire brewer,
resigned as master of the Belvoir hunt, saying 'if (the bill) became law, he
could not continue the heavy expense of his office'.
But social and market forces have been more influential in shaping the
industry, as the authors' meticulous research and analysis confirms. It was
not the government's creation of beer houses that fuelled the rapid growth
in consumption and commercial brewing between 1830 and 1880. Instead, it was
rising real wages, increasing urbanisation and lack of leisure alternatives.
Those were the glory years of the industry, when brewing was the occupation
of gentlemen and, the authors note, 'no other business venture, save perhaps
banking, provided a surer route to a fortune'. Brewing, it was estimated,
made 33 millionaires and 50 half-millionaires, many of their names as
familiar now as they were a century ago: Guinness, Bass, Courage, McEwan,
Younger, Charrington, Watney, Worthington and Whitbread.
The death knell of many of the family partnerships that dominated Victorian
brewing was sounded in 1886 with the public flotation of Guinness. The
Pounds 6m share issue attracted Pounds 130m worth of applications.
Though a number of brewers determinedly held on to their independence into
the 20th century - and some, like the Brain, Pope and Young families still
do - the Guinness flotation pointed the way for others to convert assets to
cash and to raise more funds to enlarge their pub estates.
A scramble among brewers to buy pubs also helped to restructure the
industry. The value of Whitbread's properties, estimated at Pounds 26,000 in
1886, had risen to Pounds 2m by 1907. Many smaller brewers could not keep
pace and, in the difficult trading years to 1914, fell to bigger,
better-managed rivals.
The number of brewers halved to 1,100 between 1881 and 1914. The quest for
economies of scale in a static or declining market reduced numbers to 428 by
1940. Then, most remaining vestiges of the brewers' old clubby world were
shaken out in the merger mania of the late 1950s and 1960s, with the rise of
the corporate economy.
There were many reasons for the spate of nearly 200 mergers, which reduced
the industry to the six or seven dominant national brewers and a few
regional operations. But the authors give due recognition to the impact of
two outsiders: Charles Clore of Sears, who coveted the brewers'
under-utilised properties; and EP Taylor, the brash Canadian brewer, who, in
pursuit of a market base for his Carling Black Label lager, drove around the
UK 'bursting in upon startled (brewery) directors . . . with only the
slimmest of introductions, suggesting mergers with the eloquence of a carbon
paper salesman'.
Among the most potent influences on the industry identified in the book,
however, are the generations of anonymous consumers. 'It is the customer who
ultimately decides,' said Thomas Buxton, the London porter brewer, in 1811.
And what awkward customers they have proved to be.
Their tastes changed frequently: from porter to mild ale; then to the light,
sparkling bitters which for a time made Burton-upon-Trent the brewing
capital of the nation; to keg bitters and lager; and then back to real ales.
Beer drinkers have also resisted threats to nationalise pubs and attempts to
turn them into uniform chains. They stood firm against reformers who tried
to 'improve' pubs and drinking habits by abolishing bars and introducing
waiter service - until a Royal Commission, no less, was forced to concede
that 'perpendicular drinking is an ingrained national custom'.
Such defiance of the prescriptions of economists, accountants and social
reformers may be the reason why beer drinking remains such a feature of the
British way of life.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basis of contacts between Sir Sonny
Ramphal and BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SHRIDATH RAMPHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to refute the innuendos contained in your article, including
the headline, about me concerning arrangements with Bank of Credit and
Commerce International initiated long before its closure ('Sir Sonny had
special loan', February 16).
As chairman of the International Jury for the Third World Prize, my contacts
with the bank were essentially with its president in his capacity as
chairman of the board of trustees of the Third World Foundation. They were,
therefore, mainly concerned with the bank's philanthropic work, which
included support not only for the foundation and the Carter Centre but such
Commonwealth-related causes as the Commonwealth Cambridge Trust.
I explained fully to your correspondent the significance of the new
foundation which I was expected to lead after leaving the Commonwealth
Secretariat. It was to be devoted to issues of development, security and
environment in a north/south context.
I considered it extremely important that such a global institution should
come into being; and was ready to devote my time after leaving my
Commonwealth post to bringing it to fulfilment. The contractual arrangements
discussed with the bank were entirely in that context and of course made
full provision for assured repayment. At the time, it was reasonable to
assume that BCCI's banking activities were being properly regulated by the
Bank of England.
Within weeks of the closure of the bank, it was my legal advisers who
brought all these matters to the attention of the then provisional
liquidators. In the result, my own claims against the bank and liabilities
to it were the subject of an overall settlement, negotiated through legal
advisers and by due process more than a year ago.
Your correspondent has also referred to a Commonwealth Secretariat Cambridge
symposium in 1989. The then director of the legal division of the
Commonwealth Secretariat, Mr Jeremy Pope, has specifically refuted the
suggestion that I or anyone in my office had any awareness of the matters
relating to that symposium and confirmed that the discussion itself did take
place.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Power benefits delivered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Littlechild's power gamble' (February 14), gives the
reader a misleading and partial analysis of the power generation industry.
It is misleading because, by repeated reference to the market power and
price-fixing ability of the duopoly generators, it implies their guilt can
be taken for granted. Yet in his latest report, as in all his earlier ones,
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, confirms he has
found no evidence of any abuse by National Power with regard to its
behaviour in the market, pricing or profitability.
The article is partial because, while critical of the power generation
industry's structure, it omits to recognise any of the benefits it has
delivered. For example, electricity pool prices are still below the level
predicted by government at the time of privatisation, and competition in
generation is increasing faster than anticipated - hence the reduction in
our market share in three years from 47 to 35 per cent.
Moreover, National Power's wholesale charge for the vast majority of
consumers is significantly lower in real terms than before privatisation -
16 per cent for the typical industrial user - and the very largest users
would also have enjoyed price reductions had they not lost government
subsidies in 1991. Even without them, they are paying on average no more in
real terms.
Add to that an increase of more than 50 per cent in our productivity, and
capital investment, largely on environmental clean-up measures, exceeding
our pre-tax profits over the last three years, and I believe that this is
firm evidence of the success of privatisation.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Bank says it should run share settlement system'
(February 15), suggests that the Bank of England wants to own and control
the Crest system for the first few years of operation.
The discussion document issued by the Crest project team on Tuesday makes it
clear that the Bank wants ownership of Crest to be in the private sector,
and that the private sector owners would themselves appoint an operator to
run the system on their behalf from the outset. The Bank would be ready to
build the system, but only provided there were satisfactory commitments from
future owners to finance this process and to take on full responsibility for
the operation of Crest once building was completed.
The Bank of England will be looking to future owners to sign heads of
agreement before May 3, and the new ownership structure would be implemented
at an early stage during the building of Crest.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share options not incentive to
perform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PF NORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Monday's articles on the subject of executives' share options provide a
fascinating collection of political point-scoring, opinions and views, but
do not address the essential point.
Interestingly, Richard Gourlay commented, in relation to the electricity
company executives who stand to make significant option gains, that in all
cases the share prices have more than doubled and profits have sharply
increased ('Brown says share options cost Pounds 100m in lost tax'). So
shareholders, far from being victims of share options, have also done
extremely well]
Only Anne Simpson, of Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, comes
close to the real issue in Lucy Kellaway's article ('A fairer slice of the
pie'), by arguing - rightly - that share options are a poor means of
motivation. Executives' pay should encourage managers to improve the
performance of their businesses. Pay for performance is, clearly, the right
approach; relying on share options to provide the link is not.
Attaching performance targets to the exercise of options ignores the
inescapable truth that, in any event, the option gain is dependent on the
share price on the day of exercise. Options are a route into the equity, not
an incentive to perform.
Let's get away from focusing on the amount of executives' pay and
concentrate on the way they are paid. If the methodology represents a good
deal between management and shareholders - go for it.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: A new twist to 'The Turn of the Screw' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Glasgow Tramway, that gloriously rough, untamed and mysterious
theatre space, Scottish Opera has taken up a first-ever period of residence.
The choice of work is, on first glance, entirely apt: Britten's The Turn of
the Screw, which requires an orchestra of only 14 and a cast of only six,
and which solicits its chilling beauties of sound, mood and atmosphere from
the most economical and flexible of musico-dramatic substances.
On second glance - which on Tuesday took place during the rather fidgety
early stages of David Leveaux's new production - the opera's demands for a
proscenium-arch prove not always answerable in this loosely defined
auditorium.
The Governess arrives - by bicycle, not coach - at a Bly spread out over a
floor of bark-turf, and framed by a huge cracked, tilted window, a spiral
staircase and a pool of murky-looking water (designer: Vicki Mortimer). For
the precise scene-setting of Britten and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, the
substitute here appears to be an all-too-familiar kind of 'experimental
music-theatre': the gap between it and the opera's fine-tuned exactnesses
threatens to yawn wide.
Miraculously, the performance then sets about healing it up, with a
distinctiveness of dramatic purpose that grows ever more sure. Leveaux, a
distinguished theatre-director making his first sortie into opera, has
divined a way of exploring the trauma-haunted inner avenues of the drama by
means of an intensely physical response to the text.
The private rituals that unfold between the children, at all edges of this
increasingly wide-flung and eerily lit theatrical environment, and the
agonies of the adults are enacted with sometimes hair-raising vividness.
No-one who has witnessed this Miss Jessel scrabbling desperately in the
turf, or this Flora turned by the end into a screaming, spitting fury, is
ever likely to forget it.
In sum, this production mines frightening new insights out of The Turn of
the Screw, a masterpiece capable of supporting just such adventurous
theatrical investigation. Leveaux is immeasurably helped by the unswerving
commitment of his cast. The children (the touching, slightly frail-voiced
Colin McLean and the astonishingly powerful Paula Bishop), Menai Davies's
classic Mrs Grose and Louisa Kennedy-Richardson heart-rending Miss Jessel
all rise triumphantly to the challenge.
Philip Salmon (Prologue and Quint) sings words and notes with Pears-like
eloquence. Anne Williams-King, an impulsive, passionate actress with a
shining, sometimes unruly soprano, charts the Governess's course with a
full-bloodedness that becomes ever more moving in its urgency.
Side-stage disposition does not always aid the band; the conductor, Timothy
Lole, occasionally risks pressing the (excellent) instrumentalists to
melodramatic extremes. But the positive aspects of this remarkable
achievement render its handful of negative ones of small account.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: Malfitano's debut as 'Fidelio' - From Geneva Andrew
Clark reports on a singer who refuses to be categorised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is disconcerting to find Catherine Malfitano dressed as a man. The
American soprano looks so natural playing strong feminine roles, from Poppea
to Lulu, that a major adjustment is required when she walks on stage as
Leonore in Fidelio - in which she has just made her debut at Geneva. This is
the latest risk in the career of a singer who refuses to be categorised, and
she pulls it off by the narrowest of margins.
She was wise in her choice of setting. The Grand Theatre allows her
sweet-sounding voice to blossom, and there can be few more powerful modern
productions of Fidelio than Johannes Schaaf's, first staged in 1989.
Malfitano cuts an unrecognisable figure in black beret and loose-fitting
jacket, her neatly-parted hair adding to the boyish look. However magnetic
her stage personality, she cannot hide the fact that masculine frowns are
not her strong suit. It is only in the final scene, when her true identity
is revealed, that the character achieves some depth.
What really distinguishes her portrayal is her singing. This Leonore may
lack the heroic, large-scale dimension, but she never utters a harsh or ugly
note. She treats Beethoven's coloratura to a spring-clean, articulating the
notes with an eloquence a true dramatic soprano would find hard to match.
The other newcomer to the cast is Falk Struckmann, who has suddenly emerged
as Germany's leading Heldenbariton. His Pizarro oozes ruthless authority,
thanks to a strong, masculine stage presence, teutonic good looks and a
commanding voice. His diction is outstanding. Hans Tschammer remains a
sympathetic Rocco, Thomas Moser a noble Florestan. Friedemann Layer's
conducting is precise and tightly controlled - not everyone's taste in
Beethoven, and certainly not mine.
Schaaf's production, designed by Peter Pabst, sets the first act in a
concentration camp and the finale on a bed of roses. The result is serious,
contemporary and moving. It underlines the gap between aspirations, hopes
and utopias and the brutal things we do to each other - no different now

FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: Down the Main Street of American song
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many singers cross the Atlantic to Europe these days, but not so many songs.
Europeans refer to 'Lieder' and 'melodies', but have no convenient term by
which to describe a tradition of American song-writing that embraces
everything from homespun ballads to the star-spangled musical hits of
Broadway.
On Tuesday the Wigmore Hall offered the curtain-raiser for its series
'Discover American Song'. Over the next six weeks American singers will roam
down the Main Street of song history in the US. There is no music by Stephen
Foster listed, so nobody will be singing of Jeanie with the light brown
hair, but the main composers are there, not just Copland and Barber, but
also Gershwin and Porter. A work called Sunday at MacDonalds has
intriguingly been left until the end.
With the influence of airs and ballads, jazz and blues, the song tradition
in America is remarkably diverse. For the purpose of this series the crux of
the matter is the contrast between the 'serious' song-writers who aspired to
a European kind of art-song and the 'popular' composers from the world of
mass entertainment. Most interesting are those who managed to be both.
How clever of Barbara Bonney to send us away humming a tune by perhaps the
most versatile crossover American of them all - Bernstein, whose 'Tonight'
she sang with touching understatement for her final encore. It was the right
idea to include a medley of Richard Rodgers, though the songs seem starved
of air in the stilted atmosphere of the recital-hall. Bonney was artful,
intimate, when they really ask for a strong blast of honest Broadway vigour.
Most of the music in the first half will have been unfamiliar here. Six
Elizabethan Songs by Argento proved to be well-made, not Tudor pastiche,
more like less-than-memorable Britten. The last is Ben Johnson's 'Hymn',
also used by Britten in his Serenade, and is quite different, spacious and
reverential. A group by turn-of-the-century Griffes included one
marvellously rich, late romantic song, 'The Rose of the Night', which whets
the appetite for more.
In the second half Bonney turned to the relatively well-known cycle I Hate
Music] by Bernstein, which she made characterful without being brash. Her
sweet, silvery soprano can sound unvarying over the course of an evening's
solo recital, but not when she sings with as much insight as she did in
Barber's Hermit Songs. This was the sort of performance that puts a work on
the musical map, not least because Warren Jones found more in the piano part
than any other accompanist I have heard. Do not be hesitant. There is a lot
of American song worth the discovery.
Further recitals in the series March 2, 4, 6, 15, 25 and 29

ITV begins two new series. The Big Race records an overland car race from
London to New York, the first leg taking the contestants to Moscow.
Highlights, we are promised, include a journey through the Channel Tunnel
and New Year's Eve in Minsk (7.30). Commando is yet another of those series
that make you glad you never became a soldier. Just as every country
believes it makes the best chocolate and the best knives, so every
specialised military unit in the world believes its training course is the
toughest. This series follows two troops of men hoping to become British
Commandos (9.30).
BBC1's new half-hour sitcom Nelson's Column is set in the offices of a local
newspaper. Gavin Nelson (hence the title; if you think national papers are
too fond of puns just look at some of the provincials) pursues local
scandals and the office junior, Clare, with equal enthusiasm (8.00).
Secret History offers a story about a racial purity programme in the US
which sounds chilling, starting in the 1920s and not abandoned until 1972
(9.00 C4).

SCHINDLER'S LIST (15) Steven Spielberg
A BRONX TALE (18) Robert De Niro
LA CRISE (15) Coline Serreau
In any rollcall of movie-resistant subjects, the Holocaust's name would be
read out first. How do you film a human tragedy so inhuman, in its
conception and enactment, that some people today deny it ever happened?
The greatest achievement of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is to make
the 'impossible' seem possible. The Holocaust did happen and the human
imagination - even the Hollywood imagination - may be able to encompass it.
Shooting in a harsh high-contrast monochrome, Spielberg and cameraman
Janusch Kaminski combine handheld camera movement with the chiaroscuro of
old archive footage. Directors have stolen the traditional clothing of truth
before - Documentary Material Never Lies  - to masquerade as guides into
history. But here the clothing seems truly to take the film over. It becomes
one with that past: not just the trappings but the real terrors beneath.
Thomas Kenneally's truth-based novel was a controversial Booker Prize winner
in its day. Was it fiction or fact or bits of both? German businessman Oskar
Schindler, played in the film by Liam Neeson, did exist and did rescue over
a thousand Jews from extinction by 'buying' them from the Nazis to work for
his munitions plant in occupied Czechoslovakia (a plant that managed, we are
told, never to produce a usable shell).
Previously, Schindler had employed Jews in his Krakow porcelain factory,
before and briefly after the emptying of the ghetto in 1943. And if we
believe the book and film, he begged, bribed or blackmailed SS officers he
knew, notably the sadistic Amon Goeth who ran the Plaszow camp outside
Krakow, to spare Jewish victims.
So was he Saint Oskar? Is Spielberg's film a hairshirt hagiography?
Mercifully not. For most of the film's 3 1/4 hours Spielberg, Neeson and
screenwriter Stephen Zaillian make their 'hero' even more of an enigma than
Kenneally did. Neeson's profile - part Botticelli pin-up, part jungle
predator - is lit by Spielberg with an eerie emphasis, so that it seems both
beautiful and monstrous.
Towering above fellow actors, Neeson swishes through offices and SS parties
in his haute couture greatcoat, pressing the flesh both manually and
sexually. His appetite for women give an edge of ambivalence to his Galahad
antics as a Jewish saviour. Is he in it for virtue or for cosy side-helpings
of vice? Is he in it, indeed, just for the commercial bonus of cheap labour?
Once the horrors begin, the play-off between equivocal hero and unequivocal
history becomes hypnotic. While watching from a hilltop the clearing of the
ghetto, Schindler seems to make his inner commitment to risk all to help the
Jews. But we only intuit. He sees what we see, so we project onto him our
responses: to the random killings, the firestorm of SS machine-guns in a
room where Jews are hiding out, the boy whose stomach is blown out as he is
marched back after an escape attempt, the fleeing girl eerily picked out in
a red coat.
Once we know that the safety-catch is off Spielberg's imagination, as it
never was in his earlier second world war venture Empire Of The Sun,
Schindler's List becomes a game of 'dare' between audience and film-maker.
Will he give us an Amon Goeth as diabolical as Kenneally and history
suggest? Yes: this is the camp commandant - sometimes more modernly camp in
Ralph Fiennes's seesaw intonations and 'Cherman' accent - who brutalised his
prisoners with beatings and bullets (including morning rifle practice from
his villa balcony). And will Spielberg tear down the tasteful veil usually
imposed between audiences and feature-film portraits of prison camp life?
Yes: the film's ragged or naked prisoners are closer to newsreel reality
than any screen fiction has managed before.
The bravest decision is to resist giving us any frontline identification
figure among the Jews. Easy to have laid on 'the Little Boy' or 'the
Helpless Girl' or 'the Old Watchmaker': a character to whose shirt-tails we
could cling, comfortable in that facile pathos. But with the victims seen
collectively, the need to individualise our sympathies is turned back on the
most difficult character of all, Schindler. And when he proves unyielding,
we even try to find a chink of humanity in Goeth.
This Nazi officer is given one overwhelmingly funny, pathetic scene of
self-transcendence in which he tastes the 'power' of mercy. Schindler, in
conversation, has tried to disarm Goeth's cruelty-addiction with some
sophistries about the thrill of sparing life rather than taking it. So for a
while - roughly, half a morning - Fiennes becomes saint rather than sinner.
He pardons those who offend him and practices his melting 'Messiah' look in
the shaving mirror. Then, bored with that, he takes up his gun again.
Here and in the movie's other two great scenes - a game of cat-and-mouse
with a gun-threatened prisoner, a step inside the gas chamber itself -
Spielberg takes us to the moral and emotional brink. When life and death are
as arbitrary as this, and when good and evil can be play-acted (Goeth) or
tinged with pragmatism (Schindler), what are the guideposts of human action?
Schindler's List only backs away from the grim near-nihilism of its vision
at the close. Preparing to flee his factory as peace breaks out in 1945,
Neeson's wheeler-dealer is given a speech of valedictory emotionalism as if
to signal to us 'Ah] He had a heart] He was a saint all along]' This scene
is a deathbed Hollywood repentance in a film we have admired up to this
point for its ability to look straight into the face of a godless time,
beyond all the special pleadings and false sanctities of past Holocaust
cinema.
Talking of special pleadings, here is Robert De Niro's directing debut, A
Bronx Tale. This film does for the New York Mafia what Saatchi and Saatchi
have done, in recent elections, for the Conservative Party.
You know the Mafia? Very nice people with Italian accents and good suits?
Well, when neighbourhood boss Sonny (Chaz Palminteri) befriends
nine-year-old Calogero, the boy's bus driver father (Robert De Niro) takes
at first a dim view. No, De Niro won't run a numbers racket for his son's
new friend. And no, he don't like the two of them hanging out together in
dives and gambling joints and police stations.
But we are supposed to like it: mainly because Sonny is one of those
mobsters with a notional heart of gold beneath the shiny suit and
bulletproof vest. The film is based on a stage play by Mr Palminteri and
plays like it. Not so much in a claustrophobia of setting: plenty of street
life and driving around in cars. More in a sentimental claustrophobia of
concept. This is a rites-of-passage movie where a boy learns Who His True
Friends Are.
Coline Serreau's La Crise is our old friend, the French buddy movie about
the life-battered romantic from the educated classes (Victor Landon) and his
blue-collar Sancho Panza friend (Patrick Timsit). While Landon suffers
serial crises - wife walks out, boss sacks him, parents split up - Timsit
scurries alongside, spouting the wisdom of the working classes. Serreau
directed the original Three Men And A Baby and still seems to think films
are like Christmas crackers: funny hats, a few plot surprises and a
pinbrained serio-comic message about humanity.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Technology: New weapon for the gendarmerie - Beating
criminals at their own game is the aim of a French mobile phone system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When police in any big city pounce on a drug dealer's hideaway there is
always a fair chance that the building will be empty, the bird flown. The
criminals have used radio scanners to eavesdrop on police conversations and
so are alerted to the swoop.
'When they arrest terrorists the police find bombs, they find arms and they
always find scanners,' says Bruno Rambaud, vice president of Matra
Communications, part of the French Matra Hachette group. The scanners can be
tuned in to the analogue radio waves transmitted by police radios and
conversations easily heard.
The latest in digital mobile communications could change all that. In Rouen,
in northern France, the gendarmerie, France's national police force, are
pioneering a radio network which uses technology similar to the newest
civilian radio. 'Now it is possible to give the police the same technology
as the people they are chasing,' adds Rambaud.
Like the latest European cellular radio services, the gendarmerie's Rubis
network uses digital technology, on which it is notoriously hard to
eavesdrop. To make it even more difficult for criminals to decipher the
gendarmes' conversations, the network uses an encryption system developed by
the French military.
The Rubis network has one further advantage: by 1998, for the first time,
the French gendarmerie will have a nationwide network with 25,000 phones
operating on the same frequency. Until Rubis was first introduced, in July
1992, all forces had to select manually a new frequency to communicate with
other groups, explains Bruno Chapuis, a captain from the Paris headquarters
of the gendarmerie who is involved in the implementation of Rubis.
By implementing a widespread digital system, the French gendarmerie have
become pioneers, closely watched by emergency services in the rest of Europe
and the US. Throughout Europe, in particular, there is a growing awareness
that crime is spilling from one police area to another. And the removal of
national boundaries has increased fears of cross-border crime.
'People are now looking at the free flow of police as well as the free flow
of criminals across borders,' explains Phil Godfrey, market development
manager for public safety at Philips Telecom PMR.
To do this, however, all European nations would need to adopt radio systems
which worked together, preferably using the same radio technology on the
same frequencies. With the French gendarmerie stealing a march on other
emergency services the adoption of one technology now looks extremely slim.
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (Etsi), which devises
European telecoms standards, is in the final stage of defining a
trans-European trunked radio system, called Tetra, to be used by Europe's
emergency services as well as vehicle and taxi fleets. However, the
technology as defined is very different from that used in the gendarmerie's
proprietary Matra system.
The Etsi standard, which will not be mandatory, is based on a technology
known as TDMA, in which each piece of a conversation or bit of data is
slotted into a time slot within the radio channel. Several calls can be
slotted side by side within one radio channel, which is 25KHz wide. It is a
technique already widely used in cellular radio networks.
The Matra technology uses FDMA, in which each caller is allocated a chunk of
the frequency. Once the call has ended, that chunk of frequency is
re-allocated to another caller.
At a meeting of Etsi in March further technical options will be considered,
using different techniques and frequency allocations, but the Tetra standard
will go ahead in its current form, come what may, says Brian Oliver,
chairman of the Etsi committee which is working on the standard.
'The TDMA 25KHz standard will be produced; it will not be shifted. That work
will emerge.' However, he adds, if there is a strong enough requirement from
potential users, other standards might be defined.
To further complicate the issue another system, based on FDMA, is being
adopted in the US.
Onlookers believe vested interests in both the manufacturing sector and
government circles will result in the implementation of at least two
different systems.
Matra is promoting its system by offering a free licence to other
manufacturers to use its technology, arguing that it is available now while
the final development of Tetra could be some time away.
Rival manufacturers are understandably suspicious of the offer. And they are
unhappy about the indecision over a single European standard. 'It's very
uncomfortable for people to spend millions of pounds developing a system
which could never be adopted,' says Godfrey.
At Motorola, which has developed both FDMA and TDMA systems, the attitude is
more relaxed. 'We're keeping an open mind,' says Andrew Dean, UK marketing
manager for the mobile product sector. Motorola has already implemented two
police radio systems which conform to the emerging US standard, in New
Hampshire and Florida. As a result, says Dean, 'our preferred solution today
is FDMA'.
It is up to the security forces to determine their needs and up to
manufacturers to assess the market implications and decide whether they will
make the equipment, says Oliver. But he believes the adoption of several
different technologies will not necessarily prevent communications between
emergency services from different countries. 'Interworking could be arranged
between the systems. It is up to the security forces to deal with their
communications needs.'
Rambaud agrees. 'What is interesting the different police forces is
interconnection through the infrastructure.'
So far in Amsterdam the police authorities have stated that they want a
network based on Tetra. In the UK, too, the Home Office has expressed a need
for a unified system in England and Wales and stated a preference for Tetra.
Elsewhere, the Belgium emergency services have announced a shortlist of
companies to tender for their network and Luxembourg is also planning a
nationwide network.
The arguments for and against the two basic technologies are complex.
Advocates of FDMA believe it is best suited to widespread networks which
have few users - such as national police networks. Proponents of the wider
band TDMA technology argue that it gives greater flexibility in providing
sophisticated services using its extra bandwidth - while an officer is
relaying details to colleagues of an escaped criminal, say, a photofit
picture of the man could be sent alongside the phone call to a local
printer.
TDMA also gives the potential for duplex - two-way - conversations. FDMA
calls are simplex, with only one person speaking at a time.
Looking at the Rubis network, it is clear that digital technology, be it
based on FDMA or TDMA, brings numerous advantages over older analogue
networks. Because calls are automatically switched between callers the
number of people needed in the despatch centre can be reduced, putting more
police on the street.
A spokesman for the Rouen gendarmerie says the safety features are what have
pleased members of the local force the most. By pressing a red button on the
side of the phone, officers under attack can immediately alert fellow
officers to the local emergency.
There is also a wide variety in the type of calls which can be made. As well
as open conference calls, gendarmes can make person-to-person calls,
particularly useful for senior officers in charge of the logistics of an
operation. Or there can be group calls, in which up to five officers
participate.
Data can also be sent across the same radio channel, and the patrol cars and
vans are all equipped with portable PCs, plugged into the same electronic
black box in the boot of the car as the telephone. By feeding the
registration number of a car into the PC the officer can find out from the
central database in Paris within just two seconds whether a car under
scrutiny is stolen.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Technology: Semi-solids give extra strength - Ian Rodger on
a Swiss company's technique for making car parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the world car market in its present shaky state, now might not seem a
good time to be developing techniques for manufacturing automotive parts.
But Buhler, a large Swiss engineering group known mainly for its flour mills
and other food processing machinery, is pushing ahead with a technology for
forming high-performance light metal components.
The technology, known as rheocasting or semi-solid metal casting (SSM), was
developed in the material science laboratories of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in the early 1970s but did not attract wide interest
until recently because the patent rights were closely held and poorly
exploited and the car industry was concentrating on easier ways to reduce
vehicle weight.
The technology is based on the fact that metal alloys move gradually from
liquid to solid state over a range of temperatures. Within that range, they
are in a semi-solid state with a consistency of butter or toothpaste.
MIT researchers, led by Merton Flemings, became interested in this
phenomenon with a view to improving the quality of die cast parts. They
focused first on steel alloys, then moved to aluminium where the
temperatures involved were much lower and so the material was easier to work
with.
The alloy, in the form of a semi-solid bar or slug, can be squeezed into a
die or mould and cooled in the desired shape. MIT researchers discovered
that this semi-solid state could be achieved in common aluminium alloys
through a simple mechanical stirring process. Aluminium producers Alusuisse
of Switzerland and Pechiney of France now do this by electromagnetic
stirring.
The resulting component retains better metallic properties than one made
from the conventional liquid die-casting process. In conventional
die-casting, the process of injecting liquid metal into a die causes
turbulence, which results in unpredictable levels of gas entrapment. This
undermines the strength of the component.
SSM castings, on the other hand, are free of gas bubbles, and so can be
heat-treated or welded and used in applications hitherto open only to
premium cast or forged components.
Furthermore, because the SSM process uses lower heat levels than liquid die
casting - about 580'C compared with 680'C - a consistent chemical analysis
can be more easily maintained because fewer elements burn off. There is less
oxide formation and much less shrinkage during cooling. Cycle time can be
faster because there is no long wait for the component to cool.
SSM castings also have a big advantage over premium castings and forgings in
that they can be made closer to net shape, thus reducing machining
requirements.
Buhler, which is a leading producer of conventional die-casting machines,
has been interested in SSM technology since the early 1980s. 'We saw it as
offering the opportunity for us to move into new markets,' says Ken Young,
vice-president, engineering and technology, in the die-casting division.
The group was one of the first to exploit the technology when the original
MIT patents expired in 1992. It has developed a line of die-casting machines
that can operate with both liquid or semi-solid metal feed - an electronic
control automatically regulates the speeds and pressures of the plunger that
pushes the metal into the die. Buhler calls its new line SC, an abbreviation
of shot control, and says the control is sensitive enough to ensure almost
perfect consistency of components.
Young says SSM cast parts can be produced at costs equivalent to premium
castings, excluding savings on machining. Savings on parts that are now
forged can range from 10 per cent to 50 per cent, depending on the part's
complexity. So far, sales of the SC machines have been modest and the line
is not yet profitable. But Buhler is willing to be patient.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): One man's revolution
 -Reform of the media buying system has left France's advertising industry
in chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michel Sapin, the former socialist finance minister who is now a founder
member of the Bank of France's monetary policy council, is generally
regarded as one of the more staid members of the fiery French political
scene.
Yet Sapin gave his name to one of the socialists' most controversial pieces
of legislation: le loi Sapin, the sweeping reforms of the French media
buying system which were introduced almost a year ago and have since caused
chaos in the country's advertising industry.
Le loi Sapin has, as the socialists intended, revolutionised the way that
media space is bought and sold in France by ensuring that the advertisers
pay for it directly rather than through intermediaries such as media buying
specialists or advertising agencies. But it has also imposed intense
financial pressure on the advertising industry and on some sectors of the
media, notably newspapers and magazines, at a time when they are already
struggling in the recession.
'What le loi Sapin has done is to reverse the balance of power in French
advertising,' says Neil Blackley, European media analyst at Goldman Sachs.
'The pendulum has swung against the agencies and media buyers back to the
advertisers.'
Advertising executives condemn the law but their clients seem delighted. 'We
don't just think it's a good thing, we think it's excellent,' says Alain
Grange-Cabane, deputy chairman of the French advertisers' association. 'When
we polled our members to see whether they approved of the new system overall
 -95 per cent said 'yes'.'
Under the old media buying system media space was bought for the advertisers
by their intermediaries. The advertisers paid them the full price for the
space as specified on the media owners' rate card and the intermediaries
kept any discounts negotiated from the media owners.
But, because the intermediaries negotiated discounts for all their clients,
individual advertisers did not know exactly how much their own space was
worth. The system also favoured the biggest buyers. The chief beneficiary
was Carat which expanded to account for more than a quarter of all media
buying.
Under le loi Sapin advertisers pay directly for their own media. Details of
each transaction are clearly visible and advertisers are allowed to keep
their own discounts. In short, le loi Sapin has introduced the same system
of media buying to France that already existed in most other European
countries and the US.
The intermediaries should be able to compensate for the loss of their old
discounts by charging fees or commission for planning and executing their
clients' media buying schedules. But in practice the intermediaries have
found this difficult. 'Most French advertisers got free media buying under
the old system,' says Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European media analyst at
Morgan Stanley. 'Unsurprisingly, agencies and media buyers have found it
hard to persuade them to pay for something that they're used to getting for
nothing.'
The problem is most acute for the big media buyers, notably Carat, which
were used to making substantial sums of money by wholesaling media space to
their clients. Aegis, the marketing services group that owns Carat, last
autumn announced a substantial financial restructuring programme, chiefly
because of the impact of le loi Sapin.
France's larger advertising agencies are also suffering as media buying used
to be one of the most profitable areas of their business. The French
advertising agency association estimates that the gross profits of its 200
members fell by 10 per cent to FFr7.27bn (Pounds 830m) last year.
'It's impossible to identify how much of the reduction in profits is due to
the recession and how much to le loi Sapin,' says Philippe Legendre, head of
research. 'But I'd guess that it's half and half.'
The industry is showing signs of strain. The level of employment among the
association's members fell by 8 per cent to 9,260 last year. TBWA, one of
the largest French agencies, last year lost its independence to be taken
over by Omnicom of the US: as did FCA which was absorbed by France's
Publicis.
The French press has also been destabilised by le loi Sapin. National
newspapers have lost 27 per cent of their advertising revenue in the past
two years, according to industry estimates.
This is partly because le loi Sapin has accelerated the long-term trend for
advertisers to concentrate their expenditure on the most powerful media,
such as television and radio.

FT  17 FEB 94 / People: Kinnaird drives off to Santiago
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ripples from management shuffles in Inchcape's motors business late last
year are carrying the youthful and energetic Peter Kinnaird all the way to
Santiago.
Kinnaird, 41, is to take over responsibility for Inchcape's South American
and Caribbean vehicle distribution businesses, with a brief to expand in
rapid growth areas like his new Chile base, Mexico and Brazil.
This move gives a first taste of the globe-spanning flavour of Inchcape
Motors' activities to Kinnaird, whose career to date has been spent with
UK-based vehicle importers. He will move to Chile on April 5 from his
current job as managing director of Daihatsu UK, responsible for importing
and distributing the small Japanese leisure four-wheel-drive machines and
cars.
Daihatsu UK is a direct subsidiary of Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn (TKM), the
motor distributor which Inchcape bought for Pounds 376m at the end of 1991.
Kinnaird has been running it for nearly three years, and was also MD of Alfa
Romeo (GB) until the Italian manufacturer took the franchise back from TKM
two years ago.
Kinnaird's successor at Daihatsu, a fairly small-scale business selling
around 6,000 units a year, is Tony Darwall-Smith (left), 51, who is moving
after 20 years at Rover Group from his current post as regional director for
the south of England.
With Maurice Rourke, another TKM veteran, Kinnaird has thus emerged well
from the Inchcape shake-up last November which resulted in the departure of
Reg Heath, chief executive of TKM who was credited by Inchcape with having
done a 'terrific' job in integrating TKM into Inchcape. Rourke was appointed
Heath's successor.

Ernst &amp; Young International has appointed Michael Henning as its first
international chief executive officer.
Ernst &amp; Young International is an affiliation of national firms which
maintain considerable independence rather than a single global operation.
The creation of this position, therefore, marks part of a reorganisation of
the network designed to strengthen its ability to serve multinational
clients and create a common approach around the world.
As part of the change, the firm has also created three regional executives,
who will report directly to Henning. Bryant McCarthy, based in New York,
will be responsible for the international activities of the Americas region.
Ben Gossens, based in Amsterdam, will take charge of Europe, Middle East and
Africa. Paul McMahon, based in Singapore, will be in charge of Asia/Pacific.
Henning became co-chairman of the US firm in 1993, and was previously
vice-chairman for tax services there. His new job will give him a role in
shaping the future direction of the firm's 600 offices in 100 countries.

FT  17 FEB 94 / People: Bitter pill for Glaxo's Pappas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Pappas, the Glaxo director responsible for Canada and Latin America,
has resigned from the group board with immediate effect following what the
company describes as 'differences of management approach and style'. The
company says that territorial responsibility for Canada and Latin America in
itself did not warrant a seat on the board and that Pappas would not be
replaced as a director.
Last year Pappas, 46, was given responsibility for examining Glaxo's options
for entering the over-the-counter drugs market which led in July to its
joint venture with Warner-Lambert.
But a Glaxo spokesman says Pappas's departure is not the result of any
disagreement about the over-the-counter strategy though such a clash is
thought to have been behind the ousting of Glaxo's chief executive Ernest
Mario last year.
Glaxo also announced that Charles Sanders, 62, is to retire as chairman and
chief executive officer of the group's American subsidiary at the end of the
month. He will be succeeded as chief executive officer of Glaxo Inc by
Robert Ingram, currently its president and chief operating officer.
Sanders, who has headed Glaxo Inc since he joined from Squibb in 1987, will
stay on as non-executive chairman of the subsidiary and as a non-executive
director of the group. A spokesman says he will be able to spend more time
on industry issues, particularly the US healthcare reforms.
Ingram, 51, joined Glaxo in 1990 from Merck's Canadian subsidiary.
In a third change to the group board Glaxo announced the retirement of John
Hignett, 60, who was executive director in charge of the management and
investment of corporate funds. His responsibilities will be assumed by the
finance director, John Coombe.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A lifetime's travel
for a literary type - Lucy Kellaway on a UK publisher's unlikely choice of
sales promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What would T S Eliot have made of it? The company that publishes his poem
The Wasteland is trying to boost its sales with the sort of promotion
usually associated with vacuum cleaners and supermarkets.
'A lifetime's free travel - the monthly 'super' draw where no one loses,'
scream the headlines. 'Nine great prizes must be won.' All you need do is
buy one of UK publisher Faber and Faber's slim volumes of poetry or English
literature, and you could win enough money to cruise round the world for the
rest of your days.
The promotion is one of the first of its kind in the publishing industry,
which is only just discovering the marketing gimmicks that other industries
have used for decades. First came promotions for individual authors and
titles, now Faber is taking it one step further by promoting the whole
brand.
The move shows how hard publishers are fighting for market share. 'During
the recession they increased margins by cutting costs, now they are
desperate to build turnover,' says Penny Mountain, deputy editor of The
Bookseller magazine.
Different publishers are going about this in different ways. In the next few
months Penguin and Wordsworth Editions will declare a price war selling
paperback classics for Pounds 1 each.
Faber's move is at the other end of the spectrum: it is throwing money at
its brand to distinguish itself from the pack. The total cost of this
promotion is Pounds 250,000, more than a quarter of the company's pre-tax
profits last year.
According to Joanna Mackle, the scheme's creator, Faber is unusual in having
a clear brand image to promote. Only a few other publishers - Mills and
Boon, Ladybird, Virago and Penguin - are in this position. She says many
readers consciously choose to buy a Faber book. 'We are trying to strengthen
that.'
But even if people do choose books on the basis of who publishes them rather
than who writes them, Faber's choice of promotion could seem curiously
down-market. Mackle says not, pointing out that these prize draws work just
as well for quality British newspapers such as The Times as they do for the
tabloid Sun. And if it means that Faber loses some of its rarefied image,
that is not such a bad thing: 'People can make us appear holier than thou,'
she says.
Up-market or down-market, these promotions appear to be a good way of
selling literature.
Last year Faber launched its first such campaign, which held out the chance
of making one reader a millionaire. Even though the big prize was not won,
Mackle claims the promotion was spectacularly successful, and sold an extra
Pounds 1m of books. The new travel promotion runs for three times as long
and the main prize is worth twice as much again.
Since the beginning of the month, anyone who buys a Faber book is presented
with a travel bond. They could win a weekend on the Continent, a
transatlantic ticket for two, or a lifetime's travel worth more than Pounds
1.5m. There is, however, a 'several hundred to one' chance against the main
prize being won at all. But, just in case it is, Faber has taken out
insurance to cover the cost.
Eliot is most definitely not turning in his grave, says Mackle. As a banker
and a gambler he would surely have approved of the promotion.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cultivating a taste
for gourmet coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At about 8am at Coffee Connection, a gourmet coffee shop chain in Boston,
dozens of people on their way to work line up to order espressos,
cappuccinos, and exotic brews hailing from countries such as Guatemala and
Kenya. In Italy or Latin America, the scene would hardly seem noteworthy -
but in the US, birthplace of the watery, tasteless brew, the growth of
speciality coffee shops is a remarkable phenomenon.
What is unusual about this success story is that these speciality coffee
stores did not simply fill a market niche; they created it.
'When we started up (in the 1980s) people didn't really know what a good cup
of coffee was,' says George Reynolds, head of marketing for Starbucks, the
chain which began the craze on the west coast. 'So we faced a double
challenge: not only did we have to make good coffee, we also had to create a
desire for good coffee.'
The speciality coffee chains - which also include San Francisco's Peet's
Coffee &amp; Tea and Gloria Jean's (a division of Brother Gourmet Coffees) -
follow strikingly similar marketing strategies. If they are new to an area,
they use free tastings to get the word out. 'If there is a museum exhibit
opening, or a sports event, we are there, handing out free coffee,' says
George Howell, president of Coffee Connection. After they have hooked their
initial customer base, the chains rely mainly on word of mouth and
education. They offer lectures, and print free 'newsletters', available in
the stores, covering everything from a special plantation in Kenya, to the
art of making a good espresso.
'Through education, we perpetuate the coffee culture,' says Suzanne
Vanbemmel, director of operations for Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea. 'If we can get
people talking about coffee, in the same way that a lot of people talk about
different kinds of wine, then that will help create a demand.'
Location is also crucial: 'Not many customers are going to walk more than a
couple blocks for a cup of coffee, no matter how good it is,' says Michael
Cronin, an analyst at Weston Presidio Capital. 'So these companies' customer
base is really concentrated in a very small area around each store's
location.' Local media attention has helped. 'When we open in a new market,
we're flooded with calls to appear on local television stations or talk with
the local press about our coffee,' says Reynolds.
Many of the stores also sell coffee beans for home brewing and coffee
paraphernalia, including stove-top espresso machines, coffee grinders and
espresso cups. They maintain quality by buying and roasting the beans
themselves, and can be fanatical about freshness. 'After two weeks, we sell
roasted beans half-price,' says Curtis Bean, head of operations for Coffee
Connection. 'After a month, we give them to charity.'
The formula seems to work. Craig Bibb, an analyst with Paine Webber,
estimates that the US gourmet coffee business is now worth Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1bn) and will exceed Dollars 2bn by 2000. Analysts say the gourmet
chains have reversed the long-term decline in total coffee consumption in
the country. For the first time in more than a decade, consumption is
increasing. As they expand into new cities and into each others' territory,
the coffee chains will face greater competition. But they seem unconcerned,
at least in the short-run. 'There's so much room for this market to grow,
we're not worried, says Kenneth Toltz, vice-president of marketing at
Brothers. 'With new players in the market, gourmet coffee gets even more
attention, and that's good for all of us.'

FT  17 FEB 94 / Accountancy Column: Another method of stopping the writs -
Large auditing firms want the law to limit their professional liability. But
there is a different option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILE WOOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those with good memories will know that the accountancy profession has
allegedly been enduring a liability crisis for nigh on two decades. The
evidence is that the affliction has so far proved not to be terminal.
It is not surprising that the major international firms have consistently
led calls for reform of the auditing liability laws, since it is their
claims history that gives the greatest cause for alarm.
But lest their pleas be dismissed after so many years of crying wolf, it has
to be acknowledged that their exposure to claims is now significantly
greater than at any time. Their internal risks reduction procedures are also
more rigorous.
Regrettably, there is a knee-jerk reaction to implicate auditors every time
a large collapse or financial scandal causes widespread loss. The fact that
it is improbable that the initial writ will lead to a successful trial does
not seem to deter plaintiffs.
Many of the mega-claims fall into this category, and ultimately only the
courts can serve as the sifting house of last resort for laying down firmer
criteria for justifiable actions. However, in most cases the massive cost to
defendants and their insurers of proceeding down the fraught path to court -
in terms of lost management time as well as money - makes even substantial
pre-trial settlements more attractive than prolonged misery.
The UK's eight largest auditing firms now regard the risk of one or more of
their number being wiped out by claims as so acute that they are seeking to
enlist the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in their
campaign for reforming the liability laws. A paper to be put to its the
institute's council in March will call for section 310 of the Companies Act
to be abolished, thus allowing auditors to agree liability limits with their
clients as part of the audit contract.
The reformers' final aim is to have the common law principle of joint and
several liability removed from auditing legislation. Under this principle a
plaintiff enjoys a choice of potential targets, each liable for the full
extent of the alleged losses irrespective of relative fault. This gives rise
to the 'deep pocket' syndrome whereby any defendants known to carry heavy
insurance against claims are inevitably selected for the full treatment.
It is unlikely that with so many major causes celebres involving auditors
still unresolved the government will succumb to the institute's pleading on
behalf of the large firms - no matter how that pleading is dressed up as
being in the public interest.
A more realistic reform, if reform there must be, is to extend the principle
of contributory negligence to proceedings brought in contract. At the
moment, the contributory negligence is restricted to actions in tort.
Since the auditor's contractual relationship is with the company rather than
its shareholders or officers, the amending legislation would have to state
that negligent actions by the directors are to be construed as having been
performed by the company, thus bringing them within the ambit of the
contributory negligence framework.
This reform would discourage a host of claims that are unreasonably waged
against auditors when directors are the more culpable target. For example,
when a company suffers massive loss through management or employee fraud,
which the directors alone had a duty to prevent by establishing the relevant
controls.
The reform would also reduce the number of claims against auditors brought
by liquidators of companies that have collapsed because of management rather
than audit failure.
For reasons already explained few cases proceed to trial. Yet in recent
years most of those that have gone all the way have effectively stemmed the
trend towards open-ended accountability. Indeed, properly analysed, recent
judgments have achieved much of the reform that the large accountancy firms
seek.
The Caparo and Al-Saudi Banque judgments restricted the proximity available
to third-party investors and lenders seeking to recover alleged losses from
auditors. When the Caparo appeal reached the House of Lords, their
Lordships' largesse favoured the profession to such a degree that much
undignified embarrassment resulted.
Ill-informed sources within the profession even went so far as to express
the fear that the inability of third parties to sue on the basis of
negligently audited accounts somehow rendered all financial reporting
use-less.
In December 1993 the recall to rational principles of liability
determination was given a further boost by the Appeal Court's findings in
Galoo Ltd &amp; Others v Bright Grahame &amp; Murray. The immediate and ultimate
parent companies of a subsidiary lost substantial sums when the subsidiary
was placed in liquidation, and all three companies commenced proceedings
against the auditors of the failed subsidiary, alleging that the previous
five years' audits had been conducted negligently. The auditors succeeded in
their application to the High Court to have the claims struck out as
disclosing no reasonable cause, and this judgment was upheld on appeal.
The Appeal Court laid down the proper method for determining reasonable
cause in such actions. First, to ascertain that the negligent act gave rise
to the 'occasion for damage' to occur; and then to apply common sense in
deciding whether the act was in fact the 'effective or dominant cause' of
such damage. An act that merely provided the occasion for loss cannot per se
be said to have caused the damage.
Applying this principle to the Galoo case, the court found that trading
losses suffered by the subsidiary after the issue of any negligent audit
report (assuming it to be so only for the purpose of the argument) did not,
on their own, establish that the losses were caused by that report.
The report provided Galoo with the opportunity to continue to trade and
incur losses, but those flowed from the trading rather than the provision of
any negligent report. Similarly, the acceptance by Galoo of a loan following
the issue of the report could not of itself have caused any loss. Leave to
appeal to the Lords was refused.
Both the causation and quantum issues underpinning many actions against
auditors hinge on the tenuous proposition that the directors would have been
able to reverse the company's fortunes or stem its losses 'if only the
auditors had told them the true position earlier'. We can expect a sharp
fall-out of such actions following Galoo.
It seems, on the evidence of many such recent findings, that the courts
provide a far more fruitful source of reform than the succession of pleas to
the Lord Chancellor's office.
All this should be put in perspective. The headlines understandably focus on
large firm liability cases, yet firms comprising 50 or more partners number
just 18 out of the 17,000 accountancy practices in England and Wales.
The statistics on litigation against smaller firms are frightening. Any firm
has a 1-in-4 chance of being sued in 1994, with the most regular heads of
claim being negligent tax advice, non-detection of employee fraud, and
issuing defective accounts to banks and other lenders.
There is no mitigation here. Rising premiums reflect the very trend
described in the institute's recent report to the Department of Trade and
Industry, which is that, by and large, the standard of auditing is well
below public expectation and professional standards.
Putting it simply, in most cases auditors are sued for negligence for no
reason other than that they are negligent.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Inflation rate increase smaller than expected: Mortgage
rates aid RPI fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual rate of inflation rose in January but the increases in both the
headline rate and the underlying rate were lower than expected, thanks
partly to heavy discounting in the January sales.
Figures published by the Central Statistical Office show the retail prices
index was 141.3 in January, down from 141.9 in December, a 0.4 per cent
month-on-month decline. The annual rate of inflation jumped to 2.5 per cent
from December's 1.9 per cent, however, as a sharp fall in the RPI in January
1993 dropped out of the comparison.
Mortgage rates fell 0.3 per cent in January, contributing just more than 0.1
per cent to the index's decline. In January last year, however, a 0.9 per
cent decline in mortgage rates had knocked 0.5 per cent off the index.
If mortgage rates are excluded, the underlying annual rate of inflation in
January was 2.8 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in December. The market
consensus had been a forecast of an underlying rate of 3 per cent and a
headline rate of 2.6 per cent.
The headline and underlying rates of inflation are now closer together than
at any time since October 1992, as the effects of the cuts in mortgage rates
after Black Wednesday disappear. Both figures are in the middle of the
government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range.
Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy,
said: 'Underlying inflation is still pretty subdued.'
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said it was an
encouraging sign that service-sector inflation, which had been stubbornly
high, was now falling.
Producer price figures, published earlier this week, showed that
manufacturers' costs were still falling.
The January sales led to some sharp price falls in individual sectors.
Clothing and footwear prices fell 5.1 per cent between December and January,
equal to the largest monthly fall since 1921.
Prices of household goods, such as furniture and electrical appliances, fell
2.8 per cent during the month, the largest monthly fall since comparable
records began in 1956.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Gentle upturn in housing market signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of a gentle recovery in the housing market came yesterday
in a survey of more than 100 estate agents which reported rises in sales
last month.
The survey by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) confirmed
that prices had stabilised in the second half of last year.
It said that 88 per cent of estate agents questioned in England and Wales
reported that prices had remained static during the three months to the end
of January. More than 9 per cent said prices had risen over the period. Only
2.6 per cent reported price falls.
Housebuilders also have reported a modest rise in house sales in January
compared with the corresponding month last year. But builders are concerned
that tax increases scheduled for April could dent prospects for further
recovery in sales and prices.
The institute's survey said: 'The level of activity in January across the
country gained momentum as the month wore on, with many agents reporting
growing numbers of inquiries and sales in the second half of the month after
a quiet phase immediately after the Christmas and new year break.'
The institute said reports of an increase in the number of new properties
coming on to the market 'could be the first sign of an end to the
'instructions famine' that has prevented even committed buyers from finding
a suitable property'. It was concerned, however, that sellers were asking
too high prices for their properties.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Official retail sales total counters CBI gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official figures for retail sales showing a 0.6 per cent increase in
January, yesterday painted a brighter picture of consumer demand than had
been indicated by the Confederation of British Industry's distributive
trades survey on Tuesday.
January's rise took the annual growth in the volume of sales to 3.5 per
cent, down from 4.1 per cent in December. This decline, however, was largely
because a strong January 1993 rise dropped out of the comparison. The
Central Statistical Office also revised its December figure to show a 0.1
per cent decline, instead of the previously announced 0.2 per cent fall.
The Treasury said the figures showed that the trend of economic recovery was
continuing, with retail sales volume figures at record levels. But concerns
that consumers are cutting back on spending ahead of pending tax increases
were expressed by the British Retail Consortium.
Mr James May, director-general of the consortium, which represents more than
90 per cent of the retail industry, said: 'January results indicate that
consumers may be taking a cautious view not helped by the pending personal
tax changes, the introduction of VAT on domestic fuel, nor the increase in
NHS charges.'
For three months to January - a better guide to the trend - the volume of
retail sales was 0.8 per cent higher than in the previous three months and
3.8 per cent higher than for the period a year earlier.
The rise in retail sales was lower than commentators forecasted but better
than the CBI survey, which said the balance of retailers reporting an
increase in sales in January was the lowest for 12 months.
The CSO said that the official figures were the more reliable guide since
they were based on qualitative data on sales rather than statements from
retailers and included a wider sample of businesses.
Detailed CSO figures showed that there were large gains in household goods
in January, up by 2.6 per cent on December. In the three months to January
sales by food retailers increased by 1.4 per cent compared with the previous
three months. Sales by mixed businesses were 1.5 per cent higher while those
by specialist non-food retailers were unchanged. Sales of clothing and
footwear rose by 1.9 per cent.
In non-seasonally adjusted value terms, the average weekly value of retail
sales in January was 5.1 per cent higher than in January 1993.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Unemployment rise described as 'exceptional'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Department of Employment officials yesterday described January's 15,500 rise
in the jobless total as 'exceptional' and insisted that the trend in
unemployment remained downwards.
The seasonally adjusted increase - which took the total to 2.787m - was the
first rise since last August. The rate of unemployment was unchanged at 9.9
per cent compared with 10.6 per cent at the same time a year ago.
The jobless total is generally expected to rise in January when recruitment
is slack. But the size of the increase took statisticians by surprise.
Unadjusted, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose by
106,572.
In spite of the increase, unemployment has fallen on average by 21,500 a
month during the past six months. Since January 1993 it has fallen by
204,700.
Fewer people left the dole queue last month than at any time since December
1992. The figure was 341,000, which is almost 31,000 fewer than in the same
month a year ago.
The number of people joining the count, however, has also eased. Last month
the seasonally adjusted figure for new people joining the count was 344,100,
compared with 388,600 in January last year.
All regions, other than the west Midlands and Northern Ireland, saw an
increase in unemployment. Nationally, for men, the rise was 13,600 to a rate
of 13.4 per cent. Female unemployment rose 1,900 to a rate of 5.3 per cent.
Following a quarterly decline, long-term unemployment picked up. Those
unemployed for more than one year rose by 11,000 on the previous quarter,
compared with a 10,000 fall in the three months to October. Those unemployed
for more than six months rose by 23,000 on the quarter, compared with a
94,000 fall in the previous quarter.
After three slim monthly increases, manufacturing employment fell.
It fell by 11,000 in December to 4.176m compared with 4.19m in December
1992. There were big job losses in coal mining and mineral extraction.
A 3,600 fall in vacancies in January nevertheless left the stock of unfilled
vacancies at its highest level for three years. During the past three months
seasonally adjusted vacancies have risen by an average of 2,500. New
vacancies notified to Jobcentres totalled 196,000 in January, down 6,900
from December but higher than in January 1993.
The hours of overtime worked in December were 8.96m compared with 8.36m in
November, with the biggest increases coming in chemicals and man-made fibre
industries. The number of hours lost through short-time working fell after
three monthly increases.
Final figures for the number of stoppages through industrial action last
year were the lowest on record. In 1993 there were 187 stoppages compared
with 253 in 1992.
Signs that earnings growth has levelled off showed up in official figures
released yesterday.
In December, average earnings for the whole economy rose an underlying 3 per
cent, unchanged now for four consecutive months. Moreover, average earnings
growth in services and manufacturing was revised up by 0.25 per cent in
November.
As a result, manufacturing earnings have been stable at 4.25 per cent for
the past four months, while service-sector earnings have edged up from a low
of 2.25 per cent in October to 2.5 per cent in both November and December.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Value of jobless data questioned: Department of Employment
statistics under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political debate resumed yesterday over the meaning of Britain's official
monthly unemployment figures.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, for once refused to comment
on the rise in registered jobless. 'Whether the total out of work goes up or
down, I am no longer going to take part in a sterile debate about statistics
that are irrelevant to unemployment,' he said. He added that the monthly
count of the number of jobless people claiming unemployment-related benefit
was 'not a true measure of unemployment'.
Mr Prescott said the claimant count understated the jobless total by about
30 per cent.
Mr Prescott is due to meet Mr Peter Stibbard, head of the Department of
Employment's statistical services, to discuss how the unemployment figures
are compiled. Mr Prescott said he hoped this could lead to agreement with
the government on 'a proper measure of unemployment'.
The government estimates that its new jobseeker's allowance to replace
unemployment benefit in the spring of 1996 will cut the monthly overall
jobless figure by up to 90,000.
Mr Prescott would like to replace the present monthly benefit headcount as
the basis for the jobless total with the assessment based on a controlled
sample of households, currently used in the government's quarterly labour
force survey.
People without work in the labour force survey sample are asked if they want
a job, whether they have looked for one in the previous four weeks and if
they ready to start work the next week.
The latest quarterly figure based on those questions showed there were
2.894m people jobless in the second quarter of last year. This compared with
an average total of 2.811m unemployed for the same period compiled from the
benefit claimants.
As Mr Paul Convery of the independent Unemployment Unit pointed out
yesterday, however, the difference between the two figures varies
dramatically.
He said: 'The labour force survey figures are very sensitive to people's
perceptions of the labour market.'
The existing benefit count system costs Pounds 1m a year and the quarterly
labour force survey Pounds 6m a year.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Public sector surplus hits low: Pounds 50bn PSBR forecast
questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public sector had a net surplus of Pounds 1.6bn in January, as the
government benefited from seasonal payments of corporation tax. The surplus
was the lowest recorded January figure since monthly statistics began to be
published in 1979, and was well below the Pounds 2.4bn expected by the
market.
The total public sector borrowing requirement for the first 10 months of
financial year 1993-94 was Pounds 30.2bn, compared with Pounds 21.5bn in the
same period for 1992-93. Analysts said the full-year forecast was likely to
be lower than the government's forecast of Pounds 50bn.
Corporation tax revenues were Pounds 4.94bn in January, compared with Pounds
5.27bn in January 1993 and Pounds 5.61bn in January 1992. Analysts said that
social security receipts at Pounds 3.5bn (compared with Pounds 3.67bn in
January 1993) and income tax receipts at Pounds 12.6bn (compared with Pounds
12.4bn in January 1993) were lower than expected.
One other factor affecting the January figure was a Pounds 1.2bn payment to
the European Union, resulting from a change in the timing of member states'
contributions.
All three components of the public sector - central government, local
government and public corporations - had surpluses in January, of Pounds
1.02bn, Pounds 350m and Pounds 268m respectively. Privatisation proceeds
were negligible.
Central government's January cash receipts were Pounds 22.8bn, and outlays
were Pounds 21.7bn. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities,
said: 'Net departmental outlays were very weak. Departments are over Pounds
5bn underspent for this time of year. We should expect a spending surge over
the next two months as departments rush to spend allocated money.'

FT  17 FEB 94 / Rail track charges attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high level of charges to be levied on train operators for the use of
track could discourage some teams of British Rail managers from making
buy-outs bids, it emerged yesterday.
Steep increases from the charges now levied by BR will push some profitable
parts of the system into loss and make them dependent on considerable levels
of subsidy. Although the government has promised to increase subsidies in
line with higher track charges the result will damage management morale.
One manager said: 'We would become a subsidised route. We are concerned
about the impact on staff morale and on the negative message this will send
to the outside world. We won't have the bulk of our costs under our own
control. We would be happier to earn our revenues from ticket sales than
from the government.'
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said when announcing the increased
track charges on Tuesday that they were 50 per cent higher than the amounts
charged internally by BR. The 24 rail operating companies can expect to pay
about Pounds 2.2bn for use of the track.
Some rail managers believe the increases for particular lines will be much
higher, amounting to a doubling or trebling of charges.
Other potential bidders for rail franchises said that until they were able
to discuss the charges to be levied by Railtrack, which will take over BR's
track and signalling from April 1, they would not be able to assess the
impact on their operations.
Some were hopeful that they would be able to negotiate lower charges from
Railtrack, which has said that it will make refinements to its calculations
in the next few months.
The government has presented the increased track charges as an accounting
exercise which will not have any impact in the real world.
But, one industry observer said, the rail operating companies would be
required to make profits and pay dividends to their shareholders, which
would result in funds being syphoned out of the railway.
Gatwick Express, which is likely to be the first of BR's operations to be
sold off, took a more positive view of the publication of track charges. The
Pounds 8m track charge allocated to the Gatwick service was in line with the
amount the company had been expecting.
Gatwick Express said it had not yet decided whether to apply for a subsidy.
'Other costings still have to come in but we believe we can break even,' it
said. 'If we do require a subsidy we will be bidding for the lowest
possible.'
Rail managers said they were also concerned that by becoming more dependent
on government funds they would be vulnerable to cuts in subsidies that might
be decided in future.
One said that the government appeared intent on making Railtrack and other
parts of the rail industry profitable but keeping the train-operating
companies dependent on subsidy.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Church announces management review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England's central policy-making and management structure is to
be reviewed by a commission established by the archbishops of Canterbury and
York yesterday.
Church leaders are under pressure to find savings in all areas of the
church's activities after severe reductions in the value of assets of the
Church Commissioners, who handle investments. The Commissioners' support for
clergy stipends is declining sharply, forcing individual parishes to finance
a higher proportion of their running costs.
The commission will examine the church's national-level institutions - the
General Synod, Church Commissioners, Church of England Pension Board and the
offices of the two archbishops. It will also examine these bodies'
relationships with dioceses and parishes. Dr George Carey, archbishop of
Canterbury, and Dr John Habgood, archbishop of York, urged the commission
'not to shrink from asking radical questions'.
A radical simplification of the church's structure, however, would not be
sufficient to resolve its financial problems. The church needs to increase
its income by about Pounds 50m a year, while central administration costs
only about Pounds 20m.
The commission, chaired by the Rt Rev Michael Turnbull, bishop of Rochester
and bishop-elect of Durham, is due to report by mid-1995.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Labour starts offensive over nursery places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour went on the offensive over the government's record on nursery
education yesterday by publishing figures which showed that
Labour-controlled councils provided three times more nursery places than
Conservative authorities.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said last year that he wanted universal
nursery education. But Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said
there was a deep split over the issue between Mr Major and Mr John Patten,
the education secretary.
She said: 'The secretary of state still clings stubbornly to the belief that
child care, valuable though that may be for working parents, can be a
substitute for proper nursery education for children. That is nonsense.'
Mrs Taylor's attack signalled that nursery education will be one of Labour's
main issues in May's local government elections.
The figures, compiled by the Department for Education, show that 34 of the
40 local education authorities in England with the highest proportions of
three and four-year-olds in nursery education are Labour-controlled. None of
the bottom 25 is Labour-controlled.
Newham, a Labour-controlled east London borough, came highest with 64 per
cent, followed by Walsall (where no party has overall control) on 60 per
cent, and the Labour councils of Cleveland, Manchester, Merton and Sandwell
on 57 per cent. Gloucestershire (no overall control) had no nursery
education.
Mr Patten yesterday announced the first eight schools to be given approval
to set up sixth forms under a new government initiative in response to the
'staying-on revolution'.

FT  17 FEB 94 / DTI fraud probes branded 'grossly unfair'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Boardman, the former government minister and ex-chairman of National
Westminster Bank, yesterday criticised Department of Trade and Industry
fraud investigations as 'grossly unfair'.
In a debate in the House of Lords, he attacked the department's
'inquisitorial tribunals' for what he said was 'injustice and unfairness
which can be occasioned to individual participants'.
Lord Boardman, who is chairman of Heron International, the property and
trading group, accused DTI inspectors of often acting as 'detective,
inquisitor and judge'.
He was backed by Lord Clark of Kempston, who said the Financial Services
Act, which underpins City regulation, had not achieved the result that
ministers wished.
Lord Clark said the length of DTI inquiries was often 'completely barmy' and
against natural justice. He warned that if the City became over-regulated
other financial centres would benefit.
Concern in the City that traditional legal rights can be trampled on by DTI
inquiries stems from the compulsion to answer questions and the ability of
DTI inspectors to pass information gleaned in such interviews to the Serious
Fraud Office.
Lord Boardman said he was worried that the inquisitorial nature of DTI
tribunals 'was alien to the concept of justice generally accepted in the
UK'.
Lord Selsdon, who runs his own business, accused ministers of 'running for
cover' whenever there were fraud allegations, only to 'get someone to head
up an inquiry which was usually unfair and unjust'.
Lord Spens, whose trial on charges relating to Guinness's share-support
operation in the 1986 takeover of Distillers was abandoned, criticised the
DTI for using answers from those accused of fraud in evidence against them.
For the government, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry said that while there was
concern at the length of time it took the DTI to publish its reports, he was
satisfied that 'on balance the public interest is best served by the present
system'.
Tougher sentences for money laundering came into force yesterday under the
1993 Criminal Justice Act, which increases the maximum sentence to 14 years.
It increases the duty on banks and on auditors to report suspected cases,
and creates a new offence of knowingly possessing, using or acquiring the
proceeds of drug trafficking or terrorism.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Student loan 'success' hailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Boswell, the higher-education minister, said yesterday that
government loans were a success with students after figures showed that more
than 1m loans had been taken out.
Students, lecturers and university vice-chancellors attacked his assessment,
saying that the loans scheme had led to increased levels of poverty.
The proportion of students taking a loan rose to 40 per cent in 1992-93.
Among these, 5 per cent of their income came from paid work compared with 6
per cent for those who did not apply for a loan. The average value of loans
taken out increased from Pounds 388 in 1990-91 to Pounds 656 in 1992-93.
During the next three years grants will be cut 10 per cent each year, and
loans will be increased to compensate.
Mr Boswell said: 'Student loans are now an accepted part of the
higher-education landscape. It is clear that the student loans scheme is a
success.'
Mr David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University
Teachers, said: 'If you are starved for a week you will do anything for
food. If these are the current indices of success then we are in deep
trouble.'
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said the loans scheme would
have been much more popular if the government had decided to use a flexible
system of repayments, possibly linked to the tax system, rather than a
mortgage-style loan scheme with fixed repayments.
It suggested that students, who were young and afraid of debt, were instead
being forced to take on part-time employment during term-time.
Lord Russell, a history professor at King's College, London, last month
raised fears that student poverty had affected academic standards when he
told the House of Lords that paid jobs had done 'a great deal of harm' to
the quality of higher education.
He said at least a quarter of his students were working in paid employment
for more than 12 hours each week.
The National Union of Students said that last year's default figures from
the Student Loans Company, which gained county court judgments against 636
graduates, were 'just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg' because at
that stage graduates could only have borrowed for one year.
Students graduating later this year may have taken three loans, and could
face much higher levels of debt, the union added.
The NUS also attacked the administration of the company. Debts can be
deferred if students are unemployed, but the company will not grant
deferment unless the graduate can produce a P60 form. The NUS said this was
difficult to obtain in the middle of the financial year.

FT  17 FEB 94 / SFO dismayed at lenient sentences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office has been disappointed by some sentences imposed by
judges on convicted fraudsters, Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO,
said yesterday.
He stressed in evidence to the Commons home affairs committee that the SFO
had no role in the sentencing process but said officials had personal views
about the kind of sentences that were appropriate. 'Our expectations are not
always met,' he said.
Mr Staple was being questioned over the outcome of prosecutions such as that
of financial salesman Mr Roger Levitt, who received a community service
order after pleading guilty to deceiving Fimbra, the regulatory body.
Mr Staple denied that the SFO had contributed to convicted fraudsters
receiving sentences that were over-lenient.
He said prosecutors did not accept guilty pleas to only minor offences in
order to secure a conviction and avoid a trial. Nor did they accept pleas in
exchange for fraudsters avoiding imprisonment.
He also defended the SFO against accusations that it could ruin a company by
investigating its affairs and this becoming public knowledge.
Search warrants were a normal investigative tool, he said. Damage to a
company's reputation could be 'repaired' because, if nothing came of the
investigation, most people would reach no adverse conclusions about the
company.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Minister to address TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, has agreed to
speak to next month's Trades Union Congress public-sector conference being
held to protest at the government's pay freeze.
This is the first time in living memory that a Conservative minister has
addressed an organised TUC conference.
It indicates that the TUC, under its new general secretary Mr John Monks, is
keen to re-establish its credentials as an organisation that is ready to do
business with the government of the day whatever its political colour. It is
also a sign that the TUC is keen to distance itself from a close
identification with the Labour party.
Since the Conservatives were elected to office in 1979 relations between the
TUC and the government have been virtually non-existent. As prime minister
the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher rarely met TUC delegations.
Mr Dorrell can expect widespread criticism from public-sector union
delegates when he visits Congress House in London on March 3. The unions
representing 4.5m workers remain strongly opposed to the government's
freezing of the pay bill.
The TUC believes it will require heavy job losses to provide efficiency
savings to pay public-sector workers rises of more than 2 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A widow said yesterday that she was considering suing Barclays Bank after an
inquest returned a verdict of suicide on her husband.
Stephen Langley killed himself after Barclays Bank demanded the return of
his cheque book and card because making a loan repayment would have made his
account overdrawn by Pounds 72, Birmingham coroners court heard.
The inquest hear that his monthly wage of Pounds 943 had not been credited
to his Coventry account because of a delay in the clearing system. 'Mr
Langley was harried in a way quite unsuitable in the circumstances for a
comparatively small amount of money,' said Mr Richard Whittington, the
coroner. He had been depressed before and the bank's letters may have tipped
the balance.
The inquest heard that Mr Langley had struggled to repay several previous
instalments of the Pounds 1,200 loan and had pledged to remain in credit
after bank counselling.
Barclays said: 'Knowing what we know, we believe we acted as sympathetically
as possible in the circumstances and given the same situation again we would
do the same.'

<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the planned new watchdog for retail
financial services, yesterday announced the final composition of its board,
which is to increase from 19 members to 21.
This does not mean, however, that the authority has bowed to pressure from
within the financial services industry that current practitioners should
form a majority on the board. The board will have 10 practitioners, with 10
public-interest directors, including the chairman and the chief executive.
The announcement on the board's composition settles one of the remaining
questions before publication of the authority's prospectus next Monday,
assuming that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, gives approval today.
The industry will use the prospectus, and more detailed information on how
the authority plans to approach regulation, to decide whether to support the
new regulator.
Only one public-interest director remains to be appointed.
The four new practitioner directors are: Mr Lawrence Churchill (National
Westminster Life Assurance); Mr Peter Gray (Tunbridge Wells Equitable
Friendly Society); Mr Geoffrey Lister (Bradford &amp; Bingley building society);
and Mr Michael Pickard (Royal London Insurance).

FT  17 FEB 94 / Pru chief backs regulation shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changing to regulation of retail financial services through a single-tier
regulator directly accountable to parliament need not involve years of
delay, Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest
life insurer, said yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee's
inquiry into financial regulation, Mr Newmarch called for a single-tier
regulator which would set minimum standards of adequate protection and leave
it to competitive pressures to bring about other improvements.
He agreed, however, that even a single-tier regulator could involve a
further structure of a network of practitioners to ensure industry
involvement.
Regulation would be better carried out through an agency rather than
government itself since the industry was so complex.
The delay and uncertainty that a further shift in the regulatory regime
would mean is one of the arguments used by supporters of the proposed
Personal Investment Authority.
Mr Steven Howarth, consultant to the chief executive, said the Financial
Services Act 1986 gave ministers most of the powers needed to regulate the
sector and it could be a question of 'stripping out excrescences', rather
than 'going back to a blank sheet of paper'.
Attacking the present system for imposing bureaucratic burdens, Mr Newmarch
said it cost Prudential an extra Pounds 7m last year to meet regulators'
requirements - the equivalent of employing 80 people.
Challenged by MPs when he said that the problem over the mis-selling of
personal pensions to people transferring out of an occupational scheme was
'around the margin', Mr Newmarch said that the study by accountancy firm
KPMG Peat Marwick into pension transfers was a criticism of the 'process
rather than of poor selling'.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Kent council gives pay rises of 2.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kent County Council's white-collar staff have been awarded a 2.9 per cent
pay rise, the highest yet to be made by the handful of local authorities
which negotiate pay locally.
The council, which under government guidelines has to pay the increase out
of efficiency savings, has based the award for all its white-collar workers
on the 2.9 per cent national award recommended by the pay review body for
teachers. They make up 9,600 of the council's 11,500 white-collar staff.
The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates pay nationally on
behalf of local authorities, said that traditionally there was no direct
link between teachers' pay and that of other white-collar workers in local
government.
The government will allow the two English counties facing reorganisation
next year to borrow up to Pounds 9m to cover the transition costs. Isle of
Wight authorities will be allowed to borrow Pounds 1.48m in total, while the
five Cleveland councils will be able to borrow up to Pounds 7.52m.
The government expects that early revenue savings and capital receipts from
reorganisation will reduce the need for further transitional assistance.

FT  17 FEB 94 / M11 protesters evicted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Protesters were evicted from five houses in the path of a planned extension
to the M11 motorway at Wanstead, east London, in an operation that saw
officials demolishing roofs with sledgehammers. Up to 300 protesters faced
700 police officers, some in riot gear, 300 security staff, and officials
and bailiffs in an operation thought to have cost more than Pounds 200,000.
Police said six people were arrested. Liberty, the civil rights group, said
it was concerned that sledgehammers were swung dangerously close to people's
heads. Environmentalists, who have declared the scene to be the independent
state of Wanstonia, now plan further stalling tactics along the proposed
route of the extension.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Tory chiefs aim to heal splits in party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative managers plan a drive to rally the party behind Mr John Major
before a triple campaign for local, parliamentary and European elections
starts in earnest.
Party strategists are concerned that the political fall-out from Mr Major's
troubled Back to Basics initiative is being compounded by a festering split
on Europe.
They fear that internal divisions could undermine hopes of avoiding
humiliation in the local elections, three Commons by-elections in May and
the European poll in June.
Mr Major was given a significant boost last night by Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, in a speech to the rightwing 92 Group of Conservative
MPs. His speech, to an audience which has frequently been hostile to Mr
Major, amounted to an attempt to dispel suggestions that cabinet
rightwingers were not giving Mr Major full support.
Mr Lilley praised the 'clarity' of the prime minister's views on Europe and
insisted that Mr Major was 'the only person who can lead a united party to
victory in the next general election'.
Party officials are concerned, however, that a split on federalism may burst
into the open next week when the European People's party publishes its
European election manifesto.
Tory strategists plan to use speeches by cabinet ministers at the weekend to
distance the party from the federalist EPP, which includes several
conservative delegations in the European parliament.
The speeches will stress that the EPP manifesto is not binding on
Conservative candidates in an attempt to forestall criticism from rightwing
Euro-sceptics such as Lord Tebbit.
Officials say the intention is to link Britain's sustained economic recovery
to the opt-out which Mr Major secured from the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty.
The prime minister is expected to stress the need for party unity during the
second of a series of regional tours - a two-day visit to Scotland starting
tonight.
On his return from Moscow last night Mr Major was presented with a difficult
decision on whether to fight rebel Conservative peers who have virtually
wrecked the government's controversial police bill.
An escalation of the row over parliamentary business was headed off
yesterday when Tory MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee decided
against pressing ahead immediately with their threatened coup against Mr
Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman.
The MPs - who form a majority on the committee - passed a motion giving Mr
Caborn a two-week stay.
They expect him to use this period to take 'appropriate steps' to halt what
they regard as 'unacceptable interference' with the committee's freedom of
action.
Mr Caborn said last night he would make 'appropriate representations' to
carry out the terms of the resolution.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Interest but few takers in multi-media markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is widespread corporate interest in the multi-media market but not
many companies are ready to take advantage of the new business
opportunities, says an international survey.
Formerly separate sectors such as computers, telecommunications,
broadcasting and entertainment are covered by multi-media.
More than 500 executives from cable and satellite companies throughout
Europe and North America responded to a detailed questionnaire devised by
consultants Touche Ross in co-operation with the Financial Times.
The survey shows that while 89 per cent were interested in multi-media
markets and in offering multi-media services, only 33 per cent were ready to
move.
In the consumer market the services seen as most likely to be successful
within the next three or four years ranged from computer games and
video-on-demand to screen-based home shopping.
A little further down the consumer market line, screen-based distance
learning and home banking were seen as potential growth services.
In the business sector, on-line business and financial news, company
messaging, interactive travel information and booking and computer-based
training were judged the services most likely to succeed in the next four
years.
Nearly 90 per cent of respondents supported the view that co-ventures and
collaboration across several industries would be needed to encourage market
development.
Mr Rob Woodward, telecommunications and media partner at Touche Ross, warned
of multi-media hype at yesterday's FT Cable and Satellite conference and
said the pace of market development may have been exaggerated.
'It's not yet a revolution,' he warned.
A full report on the survey will be published next month.

Terrorists attacking the Channel tunnel or trains could face life

Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, urged the government to ensure

The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority said it had decided to

negotiations.
But Stagecoach Holdings, a private bus company which has made a rival bid

FT  17 FEB 94 / Bottomley hits at ineffective NHS surgery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hospital doctors carry out too many operations that are clinically
ineffective and cause unnecessary costs to the National Health Service, Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will say today.
Mrs Bottomley, in a speech to be delivered to a conference in Birmingham,
will launch a campaign to ensure that more operations are driven by 'fact
not fashion'. She will also argue that new research and development
techniques need to be applied systematically to the whole of the NHS.
According to Mrs Bottomley the prevailing view on the necessity for some
operations has changed, and the NHS needs to concentrate money on activities
that bring the most benefit.
In an advance copy of the speech she calls into question the method of
treating 'glue ear' - the illness that was at the heart of a political storm
in the last general election campaign, when a girl called 'Jennifer' was
highlighted as having failed to receive treatment quickly enough.
Mrs Bottomley supports the view that 'the optimal medical treatment for
Jennifer might well have been to wait'.
The health secretary also claims that old-fashioned methods may sometimes
bring surprising results in treatment. She asks: 'Who would have thought
that the humble leech, passed over by the age of reason and science, would
be making a comeback as part of the plastic surgeon's repertoire of
micro-surgical techniques?'
Mrs Bottomley says that managers 'do have a proper role keeping up the
pressure by reminding clinicians that when a decision is made, a cheque is
written'.
She also calls for patients to be involved more fully in the decisions over
whether an operation should be carried out. 'The patient, who has to live
with the consequences, has a right to be involved in these dilemmas.' Mrs
Bottomley outlines three ways in which clinical effectiveness could be
raised:
Using research to find out what works and to evaluate costs. Using
education, clinical guidelines and contracts between purchasers and
providers to promote what works.
Using clinical audit to assess the effectiveness of what is done.

FT  17 FEB 94 / City prepared to finance cable TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK cable television industry is expected to raise between Pounds 2bn and
Pounds 2.5bn in debt finance this year to build cable networks, a much
higher figure than expected and an indication of the changed City attitudes
to the sector.
The forecast came yesterday from Mr Gary Stephen, head of media and
telecommunications at NatWest Markets. He told the FT Cable and Satellite
conference in London that there was 'a sea change' last year in the way the
market valued cable assets.
The International Cabletel deal in New York, in which the UK cable interests
of Insight Communications merged with OCom, a quoted US cellular
communications company, valued a cable franchise at Pounds 250 per home even
where the network had not been built.
'So in the space of 12 months, valuations per unbuilt home stretched from
Pounds 10 to Pounds 250,' said Mr Stephen, who emphasised that the market
was still too immature for the figure to act as a yardstick.
Mr Stephen said he expected to see the emergence of publicly quoted cable
companies this year. He did not give names but the industry believes that at
least four of the largest companies - Telewest, Comcast, General Cable and
Bell Canada - are all looking at the possibility of a flotation.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission,
said yesterday that homes subscribing to multi-channel cable reached 611,423
by the beginning of January - a rise of 39 per cent in 12 months.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Coal areas to gain EU aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is to allocate Ecu400m (Pounds 304m) of aid to coal
communities over the next four years under the European Union's Rechar
programme, it was announced yesterday.
A large part of the Rechar money, which was unveiled as part of the broader
Ecu13.45bn, six-year programme of structural funding yesterday, is expected
to go to British coal regions, which have been among the worst hit by the
decline of the coal industry.
The money will be provided between this year and 1997 to support community
projects. There was no firm decision on the precise allocation of funds to
the different member states.
Mr Bruce Millan, regional policy commissioner, is expected to unveil further
details of the European-wide programme in Brussels today.
Although yesterday's decision did not earmark funds for particular regions,
Britain's coalfield communities were confident that a large proportion - the
equivalent of Pounds 150m - was coming their way.
Councillor Hedley Salt, representing the coalfield local authorities, said:
'Our areas are in desperate need of new industries and new jobs. This
marvellous support from Brussels highlights just how little has come from
our own government.'
Rechar funds have been delayed in the UK because of disagreements between
Brussels and Whitehall over their allocation.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Loyalists issue a call to arms: Michael Cassell on the
motives behind the violent campaign against nationalists in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Valentine's day chocolate-box bomb attacks on Northern Ireland's
Roman Catholic community have heightened fears in the security forces that
the province faces a rising wave of loyalist paramilitary violence.
With IRA terrorist activity at a lower level during the lengthening
republican debate on the Downing Street declaration, loyalist attacks have
been at the forefront of violence in Ulster and have triggered arguments
over motives behind the escalating campaign.
The recent attacks, which have left three people dead and several badly
injured, have also provoked a fresh row among Ulster's political parties.
Some nationalists say unionist attempts to explain the upsurge in loyalist
extremism are fanning the flames of hatred. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is
once again the target of allegations of suspected collusion between officers
and loyalist paramilitaries.
Loyalists who have traditionally claimed their attacks are in direct
response to IRA violence and would stop if the IRA laid down its arms, now
insist they are fighting to halt what they see as the political assault on
the province's position within the Union. The struggle to stop a looming
'sell-out' to Sinn Fein has, apparently, joined hatred of the IRA and
impatience with the security forces' efforts as a legitimate motive for
their activities.
The loyalist onslaught has involved attacks with guns, bombs and mortars.
Sinn Fein headquarters and nationalist politicians have been targets and
attacks on Catholics have occurred. Most of the incidents have been claimed
by the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an arm of the Ulster Defence Association,
the province's largest paramilitary group.
Dr Philip McGarry, chairman of the centre Alliance party, says the UFF
campaign means 'any Catholic is now a target of the loyalists'. Mr Seamus
Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
party, believes the paramilitaries are now intent upon killing his party
members.
Some Ulster politicians believe the loyalists' latest explanation for their
activities is no more than a smokescreen for continuing sectarian warfare.
But a UDA statement after the weekend murder attempt on a leading SDLP
member said it was part of its 'on-going proactive campaign against those
directly involved in exercising the nationalist veto on democratic progress
within Northern Ireland'.
Unionists have been criticised for talking about a 'pan-nationalist' front
embracing all Catholics and intent upon creating a united Ireland. Mr Peter
Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, is under attack
for suggesting it was 'probably logical that people in the loyalist
community have seen that terrorism has worked for the IRA and feel that they
can make it work for themselves'.
Neither have the police escaped criticism. Mr Alex Attwood, a Belfast SDLP
councillor, said he believed officers at 'lower levels' in the RUC were
'turning a blind eye' to potential attacks in Catholic areas. The RUC denies
this.
The RUC is in no doubt that, if the IRA again steps up its campaign, the
loyalist paramilitaries will do the same. The security forces believe that,
while loyalist extremists may not be so well organised, the numbers of
highly motivated, active volunteers are on a par with those of the IRA and
their weaponry has been improving.
Recent disclosures of a 'doomsday' plan by the UDA involving the creation of
an 'ethnically pure' Protestant homeland in the event of a republican
'victory' and British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, were treated with
scepticism by politicians. But they raised the spectre of loyalist
paramilitaries replacing the IRA as the prime architects of violence in the
event of a political settlement in the north.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Electricity shows highest return of sold-off utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity industry earned the highest return on capital of the
privatised utilities in 1992-93, a comparison of regulated industries shows.
The Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries reports today that the
average return on historical capital employed in the non-nuclear electricity
industry was 23.4 per cent over the period. This compared with 15.2 per cent
in telecommunications, 13.6 per cent in gas, 10.9 per cent for airports and
10.6 per cent for water.
The report follows last week's agreement by the electricity generators to
cap wholesale electricity prices after complaints about rising electricity
charges. Since then electricity distributors have started to cut prices in
their long-term contracts with industrial users.
The report shows that Scottish Power earned the highest return on capital of
the privatised utilities with 33.6 per cent, followed by the National Grid
Company, which is jointly owned by the electricity distributors, with 28.9
per cent.
The report also showed that the state-owned nuclear generators, Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear, have a long way to go before earning
private-sector returns. Nuclear Electric's return on capital was 7.4 per
cent, and Scottish Nuclear's was 4.7 per cent.
A public inquiry has been ordered by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary,
into the application by Scottish Power to build a 40-mile line of pylons
across Ayrshire as part of the planned interconnector to supply power to
Northern Ireland, James Buxton writes.
The application is opposed in Ayrshire. It would involve building more than
200 pylons from near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire, which
protestors say is one of the county's most beautiful areas.
The interconnector, which is expected to cost Pounds 175m, also involves a
cable across the Irish Sea. It will permit the transmission of 250MW of
power to Northern Ireland Electricity, which is paying all but Pounds 20m of
the scheme's cost.
National Power, the electricity generator, was fined Pounds 7,500 and
ordered to pay Pounds 13,250 costs for causing an oil spill in the river
Thames. The spill, which happened last summer, was from the company's
Littlebrook 'D' power station.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Ulster Unionists set out north-south proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ulster Unionist party's proposals for a political settlement in Northern
Ireland will argue that north-south relations should be maintained by ad hoc
meetings between Irish ministers and representatives of a devolved Ulster
assembly, rather than by separate institutions.
This indication of the gulf that still separates participants in the
political talks on the province's future emerged at Westminster yesterday as
London and Dublin sought to maintain pressure on republican leaders to make
a positive response to the Downing Street declaration.
Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said in Omagh that Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, was lagging behind public opinion. It faced 'only
one rational choice' in accepting the joint declaration.
This message was supported by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
who said he believed the Northern Ireland secretary had recently given
enough clarification to clear up any outstanding matters.
Mr Reynolds said in Dublin that he hoped Sinn Fein would give a positive
response as soon as possible.
It emerged at Westminster that the government is taking fresh soundings from
MPs about the functioning of its ban on broadcasting the voices of Northern
Ireland terrorists or their supporters - less than two weeks after
announcing restrictions would stay in place.
Last Sunday's television interview with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, on ITV's Walden programme is understood to have heightened
concerns that the ban can work in the terrorists' favour by allowing their
words to be spoken by actors while ruling out aggressive questioning.
It is thought highly unlikely that a move to lift the restrictions would
come before Sinn Fein's annual conference later this month. Such a move
would face stiff resistance at Westminster.
Downing Street said it did not think there were any 'present plans' for a
change.
The UUP proposals - to be published this month - focus mainly on the
internal government of the province. They are expected to flesh out the
'blueprint for stability' proposed by Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader,
last March.
The UUP is to send a delegation to the US later this year for talks with
politicians and business people.
The decision follows the highly publicised visit last month to the US by Mr
Adams. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, has also
said he intends to visit the US.

A person can be bound over without being convicted of an offence, and
although people cannot be bound over without their consent, they may be

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: For Kantor, the Motorola case says it all
 -Michiyo Nakamoto and Nancy Dunne on US frustration at Japan's trade
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a country that is known for its fascination with high technology, Japan
has been remarkably slow to catch on to the mobile telephone revolution that
has swept through other parts of the world.
Despite being the first country to introduce cellular phone services, Japan
has fewer users of cellular phones as a proportion of the population than in
any other industrialised country. Germany has acquired more cellular
subscribers in the past two years, than Japan in the past 14.
Many see the culprit as over-regulation that has led to a stifling lack of
competition. The number of service providers has long been restricted and
worse still, what competition that exists is largely kept out of the most
attractive Tokyo-Nagoya region where population is concentrated.
The announcement that the US would start a process of sanctions against
Japan comes after an almost decade-long campaign by Motorola, the US
industry leader which developed the product with AT&amp;T, to establish itself
as a significant force in the Japanese mobile phones market. It follows a
decision by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, that Japan had
violated bilateral agreements to allow comparable market access to US mobile
phones and equipment in the Japanese market.
To Mr Kantor, the Motorola case goes a long way towards explaining Japan's
Dollars 60bn trade surplus with the US.
The difficulty the US has had in penetrating Japan's market, despite
previous threats of sanctions followed by concessions on Japan's part,
reflects 'a classic case of the determination of Japan to keep its markets
closed, particularly to leading edge US products,' he said when he announced
the decision to start a process of imposing trade sanctions on Japan.
In agreements made over several years, Japan had promised the US to give
Motorola an equal chance to compete with NTT, the Japanese telecoms group,
by giving Motorola's cellular phone system the necessary radio frequency and
infrastructure.
But the history of Motorola's experience in Japan has been one of broken
promises, the US claims.
The dispute goes back to 1985 when the Japanese authorities decided to
introduce a measure of competition into Japan's cellular phone market.
Until then, NTT, which for long had a monopoly over telecommunications
service, was the sole provider of mobile phone services and it was using a
proprietary technology.
The ministry of post and telecommunications agreed to allow other cellular
providers to compete with NTT. But NTT was authorised to provide cellular
service through the country, while two competitors - IDO and DDI - had to
divide the market between them.
The US took this opportunity to pressure Japan into accepting the use of a
North American cellular phone technology known as TACS which was being used
by Motorola.
But while they acquiesced under US pressure and agreed to give Motorola a
chance, the Japanese telecommunications authorities nevertheless kept
Motorola's activities restricted by excluding the TACS system from the
densely populated Tokyo-Nagoya region where growth of cellular phones could
be expected to be highest.
The MPT's first excuse was that it did not have enough radio frequency in
that region to give to the TACS system. Then when it was discovered that
frequency did in fact exist, the Japanese authorities devised a rather
awkward compromise.
IDO, a cellular phone operator which was competing with NTT in the
Tokyo-Nagoya region, was given responsibility for building up the TACS
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya region and 5Mhz of frequency was allocated to IDO
for that purpose.
The problem was that, IDO, though competing with NTT in that area, was doing
so using NTT's proprietary cellular phone technology. IDO had already
committed considerable sums to building up infrastructure based on that
technology and therefore had little incentive to invest further in the TACS
system.
Over the next several years, according to Motorola, a horror story unfolded
with IDO refusing to take delivery of Motorola equipment to build up the
TACS infrastructure, and, once it did, failing to do anything with it.
Motorola handsets in shops spanning the Tokyo-Nagoya region were, meanwhile,
hidden from customers' sight, the US company has claimed.
Instead of comparable market access, Motorola has faced persistent
feet-dragging on the part of IDO in making investments in TACS
infrastructure to allow coverage for the TACS system to equal coverage
offered by NTT's mobile phones service. Today Motorola's phones can cover
only 40 per cent of the Tokyo region, and its subscribers number only 12,900
in the area of 60m inhabitants, compared with over 310,000 customers for the
rival NTT-compatible system.
While IDO has said it will increase investment in the TACs infrastructure,
this will only bring coverage up to 56 per cent in three years, compared
with 95 per cent coverage for NTT already, Motorola says. This does not
constitute 'comparable market access' that was promised to the US by the
Japanese government, US officials say.
Given the necessary infrastructure, Motorola is confident that it can
compete effectively in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. In some parts of Japan where
the TACS system has been able to compete fairly with NTT's system, it has
taken 50 per cent market share compared with less than 2 per cent in the
Tokyo-Nagoya market.
But the issue is not just one of unfair market barriers. As in other trade
disputes, the US argues that it is the Japanese consumer that ultimately
will benefit from its insistence on fair market access for foreign products.
The cost of using a cellular phone in Japan is two to three times that of
other developed countries and effective competition is a proven way to bring
prices down. While US calls for fair market access may grate on Japanese
ears so soon after the collapse of bilateral trade talks, that is an
argument that should win the applause of many a disgruntled Japanese
consumer.
Meanwhile while sanctions are drawn up, negotiations will continue. It is a
good bet that Mr Kantor will insist on the kind of 'qualitative and
quantitative indicators' Japan resisted in the broader framework talks.
If such an agreement had been negotiated in the first place, he said on
Tuesday, then it could have specified when the IDO would have infrastructure
in place for Motorola's use, and what percentage of coverage Motorola could
expect from base stations and switching systems.
Mr Kantor will probably settle for such specifics, but will not ask for
market share or guaranteed subscribers, thus avoiding charge that he is
seeking to impose managed trade.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is set to take world leadership in digital high-definition television
(HDTV) following the announcement yesterday of a final decision on
establishing technical standards for the new generation of TV technology.
HDTV is expected to provide crisper television pictures. It will, however,
require consumers to buy new television sets.
The US 'Digital HDTV Grand Alliance' - a group of companies that have been
developing HDTV technology for the US market - said that it had made its
final major technical decision by selecting technology from Zenith for
digital transmission of HDTV signals via terrestrial broadcast or cable
systems.
The announcement marks the end of months of testing of various aspects of
HDTV technology by the Grand Alliance together with the Federal
Communications Commission.
The Digital HDTV standard represents the merging of technologies from the
three groups that had developed digital HDTV systems for consideration as
the US standard. The parties involved are: AT&amp;T and Zenith Electronics,
General Instrument and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a
consortium composed of Thomson Consumer Electronics, Philips Consumer
Electronics and the David Sarnoff Research Center.
The companies agreed to co-operate last May, at the urging of the FCC, which
asked the rival industry groups to combine the best features of each of
their HDTV technology to create a 'best of the best' standard. The complete
Grand Alliance HDTV system is now scheduled for final verification testing
in late 1994 and field testing in early 1995.
The US digital HDTV system, unlike Japan's analogue system, is compatible
with computers and digital telecommunications technologies as well as
television. It is therefore expected to play a central role in the
establishment of the National Information Infrastructure (NII), known as the
'information superhighway'.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan's trade surplus widens in dollar
terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's contentious trade surplus rose by 17 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn last
month, compared to January 1993. Shifts in currency values have masked an
underlying shift in the balance.
The widening in the trade balance came despite a 3.6 per cent decline in
export volumes in yen terms. Export volumes have now fallen for eight of the
past nine months. Imports also fell, by 6 per cent in yen terms, so breaking
an 11-month rise in import volumes.
Measured dollars exports rose by 7.5 per cent to Dollars 25.9bn, inflated by
the rise in the yen's value, while imports rose less steeply by 4.8 per cent
to Dollars 19.8bn, said the finance ministry.
The weak growth in imports reflects the sluggishness of domestic demand, an
important feature of Japan's inability to satisfy US demands for a reduction
in the trade surplus.
Personal consumption is broadly sluggish and has weakened slightly over the
past month, according to a report by the Regional Banks' Association of
Japan yesterday.

FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Hong Kong cargo forecast to treble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cargo handled by Hong Kong's port, which has been ensnared in a Sino-British
political row, is set to increase threefold by the year 2011, underlining
the urgent need for new capacity, the Port Development Board said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The board forecast container handling demand would be nearly 32m 20-foot
(6-metre) equivalent units - the standard measure of container traffic -
from 9m last year.
Forecast growth rates for all cargo were similar. 'The massive increase in
cargo throughput. . . underlines Hong Kong's urgent need for a new port,' it
said in a statement.
Hong Kong's container port, the busiest in the world, is enjoying a boom
because of rapid industrialisation in neighbouring south China. But it has
also become entangled in the dispute about Governor Chris Patten's drive to
widen democracy in the colony before it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in
1997.
The Hong Kong government awarded the right to build and operate a ninth
container terminal to three consortia as long ago as November 1992, but work
has not yet started because China has refused to endorse the project.
Ironically, China would be the main beneficiary as most cargo passing
through the port is composed of raw materials heading for south China
factories or finished products en route to export markets in the west.
To cope with the increase, up to 25 new container berths would be needed at
a planned 10th container terminal on Lantau island, near the site where Hong
Kong is building a new airport, the board said. The airport is another
infrastructure project caught up in the political row.
The board forecast there will be a need for the first berth of the Lantau
port to begin operation in mid-1997 when the Tsing Ma suspension bridge
opens.
The bridge will link Hong Kong's urban areas to the new port and the new
Chek Lap Kok airport.

tourism. But few visitors venture into this remote corner of the island of
Borneo. People survive on small-scale agriculture and what is left of the
timber industry.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, says Sabah - and towns like
Keningau - have missed out on Malaysia's economic success story. While
Malaysia's overall gross domestic product has grown by more than 8 per cent
in each of the last six years, Sabah, the federation's second biggest state
and potentially one of the richest, has lagged behind.
Tomorrow Sabah goes to the polls to elect a new state assembly.
Sabah, with a population of 1.8m, is one of only two states controlled by
parties opposed to the ruling national front coalition, headed by Dr
Mahathir. For the last nine years Sabah has been governed by the locally
based United Sabah party (PBS), headed by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the
state's chief minister.
According to Dr Mahathir, progress will only come when Sabah sees the error
of its ways and rejoins the national front coalition, dominated by the prime
minister's United Malays National Organisation (Umno).
Umno is now spending thousands, some say millions, on trying to win over
Sabah voters. The heavily government influenced media has swung into action.
'Let us not waste any more time on the narrow sectarianism preached by
ambitious and self seeking politicians,' said Dr Mahathir in an election
message to Sabah voters. 'We can together transform Sabah into an
economically advanced and spiritually resilient state that will make
Sabahans proud . . . .'
But the majority of Sabahans seem unlikely to heed Dr Mahathir's message. A
PBS victory once again seems likely, though Umno could succeed in denting
the ruling party's majority.
Some voters fear the emergence of a one-party state in Malaysia. Kuala
Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, is two and a half hours flying time away from
Sabah. Many people in Sabah resent being pressured by what they perceive as
a remote and uncaring federal administration. The PBS has successfully
campaigned under the slogan 'Sabah for the Sabahans'.
Sabah's leaders say the federal government has taken away state rights to
revenues from offshore oil production and tried to impose restrictions on
the timber trade, a principal source of state revenue. Meanwhile Sabah has
been starved of infrastructure funds. Repeated requests for a university to
be set up in the state have gone unanswered.
Dr Mahathir does little to hide his impatience with the PBS, which he has
long suspected of making moves to take Sabah out of the Malaysian
federation. A brother of Mr Pairin and a candidate in the election tomorrow
was only recently released after being detained without charge for three
years under Malaysia's wide-ranging internal security laws.
In peninsular Malaysia politics is divided along racial lines. The Moslem
Malays, who make up just more than 50 per cent of Malaysia's total
population, vote for Umno. The Chinese, who have considerable economic power
but little political clout, have their own party while the Indians also have
their political group.
Sabah has very different political traditions. Over the centuries Moslems,
Chinese and Christians have intermarried. In recent years hundreds of
thousands of immigrants - some legal but many not - have crowded in from
poor areas of the southern Philippines and the eastern islands of Indonesia.
The PBS, while dominated by the majority mainly Christian Kadazan community,
is a mixture of different races and religions.
There are fears that peninsular Malaysia's racial brand of politics could
cause deep divisions within Sabah society.
Sabah has always been hard to discipline. For years Sabah's leaders treated
the state like a private fiefdom in which financial handouts were the norm,
coherent policies the exception.
One particularly profligate chief minister used to order his state aircraft
to fly round Sabah airspace while he sat back in the clouds and watched
Chinese Kung Fu films. Another indulged in grandiose road building projects:
roads to nowhere are a part of the Sabah landscape.
Dr Mahathir and his Umno party are out to tame the state the early explorers
called 'the land below the wind'. Dr Mahathir is a leader used to getting
his own way. But Sabah looks like it is going to tread a solitary path yet
again. It could be some time before Keningau sees any federal development
funds coming to town.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Nissan to cut output in Japan by 4.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan, Japan's second largest car producer, is planning to cut domestic
output by 4.7 per cent this year, possibly presaging production cuts
elsewhere in the Japanese car industry.
In the current year to March, Nissan expects to reduce output from 1.7m
vehicles to 1.62m units in the coming 12 months, because of the continuing
weakness of the Japanese market and a fall in exports to Europe, according
to company officials. The decision will be confirmed by the end of the
month.
This will be Nissan's lowest output for 23 years and well below its 2.2m
vehicle annual capacity, they said. Production capacity will fall slightly
to 2m units after the closure next year of Nissan's Zama plant, south of
Tokyo.
The Japanese car industry currently has surplus production of around 2m
units, roughly equivalent to the entire car market of Britain or France,
according to estimates by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
So far, Japan's car industry has avoided heavy redundancies. Instead, it has
given workers extra free time, frozen new employment and cut prices paid to
suppliers.
Nissan does not plan more job cuts on top of the 5,000 posts it already
plans to phase out within three years. Workers will instead be given an
extra seven to 10 days off per month, on top of the three days per month
holiday given to workers since November.
Industrial output across the board is weaker than expected. Japan's overall
production fell by 1.9 per cent from November to December, slightly worse
than the provisionally estimated 1.7 per cent, said the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.

<TEXT>
Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday agreed an open
border policy and wrapped up other details of future economic co-operation
in a new spirit of co-ordination following months of animosity over progress
in the Middle East peace talks.
After two days in Amman, delegates completed talks on issues relating to
bilateral trade, infrastructure, and business ventures, all of designed to
enhance Jordan's role in the West Bank following establishment of a
Palestinian self-governing authority.
Foremost was a pledge to adopt an open borders policy for trade across the
Jordan River. This comes one month after a banking agreement was signed
giving Jordan a central role in developing the West Bank's financial sector
with the re-opening of Jordanian banks expected soon.
Mr Mohammad Nashashibi, chairman of the PLO's department of economic affairs
said this would create an effective economic union between Jordan and the
Palestinians. But he expects fierce resistance from Israel at the next round
of economic talks in Paris next week.
Israel and the PLO have not yet agreed on trade regulations for the new
Palestinian entity. Israel is demanding restrictions on entry of Jordanian
goods should be continued to avoid them finding their way on to the Israeli
market at prices which undercut their own. Israel has suggested a customs
union with the Palestinians which Jordan and the PLO say they will oppose.

FT  17 FEB 94 / North Korea urged to open up all N-sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
North Korea's agreement to allow international inspections of seven nuclear
plants was yesterday greeted with qualified relief by South Korea and Japan.
'Japan welcomes that decision,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet
secretary. However, North Korea must now accept inspections of two more
undeclared nuclear sites, not included in the agreement, he said.
Both Seoul and Tokyo said more needed to be done to resolve suspicions over
North Korea's nuclear programme. 'This is only a beginning,' said Mr Hong
Soon-young, the South Korean vice-foreign minister.
Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party, was scathing about the accord
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency, describing
it as full of ambiguity and criticising the government for failing to
compile any 'crisis management programme' to deal with North Korea's nuclear
ambitions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimito, a leading LDP policy maker, urged the
government to take a firm stand on possible economic sanctions against
Pyongyang.
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme has caused growing alarm
among its former Japanese colonial rulers, especially since Pyongyang last
year tested a missile that could have reached Tokyo.
North Korea's decision to admit inspectors from the agency also, to Japan's
relief, reduces US pressure for sanctions against the communist regime. One
of the few points of accord between prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US
president Bill Clinton last week was to co-operate in imposing sanctions on
North Korea, if it continued to refuse inspections.
Seoul indicated it would make concessions in response to North Korea's
agreement with the IAEA. Officials suggested that the US and South Korea
will soon announce the suspension of this year's joint annual 'Team Spirit'
military exercise, long a source of controversy with North Korea.
Other measures North Korea must undertake to dispel suspicions about its
nuclear intentions, according to officials in Seoul, include:
Accepting special inspections of two undeclared facilities, which are
believed to be nuclear waste sites. They could provide evidence of whether
North Korea has processed more weapons-grade plutonium than it has declared.
Full return to the non proliferation treaty. North Korea claims its NPT
membership is still under suspension and that it is under no obligation to
respond fully to IAEA demands. The issue of whether North Korea will allow
future regular inspections is apparently still open to question.
Implementation of the 1991 North-South Korean agreement on
de-nuclearisation. Spot inspections of suspected North Korean nuclear
facilities, similar to the demands made by the IAEA, have been a main
stumbling block to the agreement's implementation. Talks between the two
Koreas on the issue have been suspended for more than a year.
South Korea is hopeful that bilateral talks with the North on nuclear
inspections and other issues could begin soon.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Accused endure a long wait for justice: Andrew Jack on
events in the BCCI trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the relative comfort of the Police Officers' Club in Abu Dhabi, ten
former executives of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
are awaiting the judgment of the court.
Periodically since last October they have been driven to the other side of
the city to the court of the first instance for hearings, the latest of
which is scheduled for this Saturday. Within a few weeks, they could face a
drive elsewhere in Abu Dhabi - to the more spartan Al Wathba prison.
They are among the former officials of BCCI who are alleged to have been
most closely involved in the frauds perpetrated within the bank over the
past decade.
Their captivity began in autumn 1990, in the months following the period
when Abu Dhabi says it was informed of fraud in April by Mr Swaleh Naqvi,
BCCI's chief executive. Drawing on initial work which attempted to quantify
the fraud, the authorities arrested some 20 individuals including Mr Naqvi.
Since April, most of them have been moved to the state as Abu Dhabi asserted
its control of BCCI and shifted its headquarters from London.
Several were released by the courts within months for lack of evidence,
followed by more last year after an initial report to the public prosecutor.
That left 14 to face charges in last July. One of these, Mr Arjmand Naqvi,
has died.
Among the remainder still facing charges, is Mr Aga Hasan Abedi, founder of
the bank, who is living in Pakistan and unlikely to stand trial. Another is
Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar, former head of the bank's treasury division, who last
September pleaded guilty to 16 charges of false accounting involving more
than Dollars 745m (Pounds 505m) of depositors' money and is now in prison in
the UK.
The others held locally, who face charges of forgery, breach of trust,
setting up fictitious accounts and falsifying loans, are: Hasan Mahmoud
Kazmi; Fakhir Hussain; Abdul Hafeez; Zafar Iqbal Choudry; Mohammed
Azmatullah; Imtiaz Ahmed; Ameer Ul Haq Siddiki; Iqbal Ahmed Ridwi (out on
bail); Bashir Ahmad Tahir and Naseem Hassan Sheikh.
Last month Abu Dhabi, as majority shareholder and creditor to BCCI, sued the
detainees for Dollars 9bn, in an action concurrent with the criminal case.
The Abu Dhabi proceedings have been gripped by a recent sense of urgency.
The periods between court appearances have been shortened, and it appears
that future hearings may take place every few days.
One reason may be the agreement reached between the Abu Dhabi government and
the US authorities last month. It includes a provision to hand over Mr Naqvi
by May 8. Although government officials insist the judicial process is
independent, they are also confident this deadline will be met.
Others are less convinced of this independence. It appears that Mr Naqvi's
US lawyer is to be funded by the Abu Dhabi BCCI working group acting in its
capacity as shareholder and creditor to the collapsed bank. The same group
is believed also to be ultimately funding the costs of the public
prosecutor, who has hired Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, to prepare
its case.
Observers hoping for detailed revelations at the trial highlighting who was
responsible for the BCCI frauds will be disappointed. After an initial blaze
of publicity and open hearings, all proceedings from the beginning of
January are being held in camera.
The defendants' lawyers are expected shortly to present their clients'
defences. However, much of the work conducted by the judge who will make the
decision on the detainees' guilt is being conducted in his chambers using
information gathered in reports already submitted by the public prosecutor.
One problem is that the carefully concealed nature of the fraud, compounded
with the Middle Eastern tradition which does not put all transactions to
paper, means that much of the evidence is based on inference. This is partly
backed up by interviews given by the defendants - generally without their
lawyers being present.
The defence lawyers have had a hard time, arguing for access to additional
documents, and - unsuccessfully - for bail or trial in another jurisdiction
for their clients.
They say their clients have already served much of their sentence, since the
maximum penalty under each charge is three years and this has already been
reached because under local law 21 days counts as a month's imprisonment.
Others question how far the outcome will be fair and independently
determined, given the enormous complexity of the case, the relative
inexperience of the judge, and the traditional hierarchical way in which Abu
Dhabi society operates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, the most powerful member of Burma's military junta, may
agree to hold talks with detained opposition leader Ms Aung San Suu Kyi,
according to a US congressman who met them both in Rangoon this week.
'I think the future of Burma will be determined by two people: Lt Gen Khin
Nyunt and Aung San Suu Kyi,' Mr Bill Richardson, a Democrat ally of
President Clinton, said in Bangkok.
Mr Richardson, the first foreigner other than her relatives to meet Ms Suu
Kyi during her four and a half years of house arrest, brought her a letter
from Mr Clinton expressing his support.
Ms Suu Kyi told him she wanted 'a genuine, high-level dialogue' with the
junta to resolve Burma's political deadlock. The armed forces crushed a
pro-democracy uprising in 1988 and then ignored the results of a 1990
election convincingly won by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, said he might be authorised by the ruling State Law and
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) to engage in talks with her. He expressed
the junta's desire for better relations with the US and said Slorc would
consider allowing the Red Cross to visit other prisoners in Burmese jails.
Burma's generals are anxious to improve their international image after
years of human rights abuses, but it is not clear how they will be able to
embark on a substantial round of talks with the two sides so far apart.
Ms Suu Kyi sent out a message to her supporters via Mr Richardson saying:
'Be courageous and democracy will win.' The Slorc has silenced most of its
other opponents and is devising a new constitution to entrench the influence
of the armed forces.
'The Slorc made it very clear to me that talks do not mean political
dialogue,' said Mr Richardson. 'What we're talking about is getting two
people together to engage in a pre-dialogue.'
Such a meeting, however, would be the least that would be required for the
US to upgrade its relations with Rangoon, Mr Richardson said. 'I think it's
essential for Slorc to accept this proposal for talks,' he said.

Private-sector bankers in Nigeria have warned that increased government
intervention in the economy in the wake of last month's budget will boost
inflation, undermine growth and damage relations with western creditors.
The measures introduced by the military regime of Gen Abacha, include fixing
the exchange rate and setting interest rates. They have worsened relations
with official creditors and stalled talks on debt relief as Nigeria
continues to default on its external debt of over Dollars 28bn. Arrears
exceed Dollars 5bn. The government's domestic debt is more than N100bn
(Dollars 4.5bn) yet the budget does not specify any money for servicing it.
The head of Nigeria's leading discount house told finance ministry
officials: 'By decreeing a 21 per cent cap on interest rates (nearly 80 per
cent) below inflation, the government has attacked the root of a growing
savings culture.
The central bank is today due to sell Dollars 100m to of foreign exchange at
N22 to the dollar, whereas importers have been willing to pay between N45
and N50 since last September.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several of Israel's former top bankers face jail sentences of up to five
years after being convicted yesterday of criminal responsibility for a stock
market crash a decade ago that cost the government an estimated Dollars 7bn
and severely undermined Israel's banking system.
At the end of a four-year trial, Jerusalem District Court Judge Miriam Naor
ruled that four leading banks, a holding company, and six leading bankers
had violated a 1977 law against selling shares under false pretences.
Two of the banks, and several executives, were also convicted of securities
fraud. Two executives, and a third who has since died, were acquitted.
Hearings on sentencing are scheduled to start next week, with sentences
likely in about a month.
The four banks involved were Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, Bank Discount and
Bank Mizrahi. Former chairman of Bank Leumi, Ernst Japhet, who fled to the
US in 1987 and returned last month following an extradition request, will be
tried separately.
The 1983 crash was caused by the country's leading banks manipulating their
own share prices - by buying each other's shares and vigorously encouraging
their customers to purchase too. Bank shares became overvalued and when, on
October 6 1983, shareholders began selling en masse, the bubble burst. The
government was forced to step in, guaranteeing to redeem shares at their
pre-fall value to the tune of Dollars 7bn.

Federal prosecutors in Argentina have demanded the arrest of a leading
suspect in the country's largest ever drug seizure, following his release on
bail at the end of December. The freeing of Mr John Arroyo Arias on Dollars
30,000 bail has again thrown a spotlight on the government's inept drug
control policies and the inadequacies of Argentina's judiciary.
Prosecutors have only now asked for Mr Arias to be detained again. A
Colombian, he was arrested in July 1988 with eight other suspects accused of
attempting to smuggle 585kg of cocaine from Bolivia. The drugs were to be
sent on to Europe and the US. A further 1,124kg were seized in the US as
part of the same operation.
Mr Arias was released because he had spent more than five years in custody.
Prosecutors only finished submitting evidence last year and now fear more
suspects could be freed. International agencies say Argentina has grown in
importance as a drug transshipment corridor and as a money laundering
centre.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptionally cold weather could cause economic growth in the first quarter
to fall short of administration projections, Mr Ron Brown, commerce
secretary, said yesterday. He was reacting to the worst figures for housing
starts in a decade. Starts fell 17.6 per cent between December and January,
but officials said the decline mostly reflected the weather. Last month was
the third coldest January in 99 years.
The decline in starts, which tend to be volatile on a monthly basis,
followed disappointing figures for retail sales and industrial production,
which fell last month after robust gains late last year.
Before allowing for disruptions caused by bad weather and the Los Angeles
earthquake, most analysts - including the administration - expected first
quarter economic growth at an annual rate of about 3 per cent.
Mr Brown did not indicate by how much growth might fall short of this
target, but he claimed the bad weather would have only a transient effect.
'The economy's underlying momentum remains intact.'
Starts fell sharply in the northeast, midwest and south, all regions
affected by severe weather. They rose slightly in the west in spite of the
disruption caused in California by the earthquake.
However, even after last month's big fall, the national rate of starts was
running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29m, 11 per cent higher
than in January last year, reflecting robust increases in building activity
in the second half of 1993. Officials yesterday revised figures for December
to show an increase in starts of 11.7 per cent rather than the 6.2 per cent
previously reported. Analysts had expected bad weather to result in a fall
in starts of about 9 per cent.
Building permits, a guide to future construction activity, also fell sharply
last month. However, most analysts are confident that starts will rebound
when the weather improves because of the stimulus from low long-term
interest rates.

<TEXT>
Mr Philip Heymann, the former deputy attorney general, has delivered a
blistering critique on the effectiveness of important parts of the
anti-crime legislation supported by the Clinton administration and now in
front of Congress.
Mr Heymann only left office last week following disagreements over
'management style' with Ms Janet Reno, attorney general. But in interviews
published yesterday he sided with positions Ms Reno herself has frequently
taken, particularly over the necessity of tackling the underlying social
factors behind crime.
His largest objection was to the 'three strikes and you're out' initiative,
under which anyone convicted of three violent crimes would face life in
prison without prospect of parole. This, he said, 'sounds terrific,' but
'doesn't make any sense'. He was afraid that the politics of crime 'has
overwhelmed serious debate'.
His opinions were at variance with some of those expressed by President Bill
Clinton, who went to a police academy in Ohio on Monday to urge fast action
on crime. The president again insisted that 100,000 more policemen were
needed on the streets, but also said that legislation on mandatory
sentencing, which he endorsed in his state of the union message last month,
needed careful drafting. He again stressed the importance of community
responsibility in combatting crime.
White House officials, however, were not exactly pleased with Mr Heymann's
interviews. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the senior adviser, sniffed 'it's a
free country and we just disagree'.
In Mr Heymann's view, mandatory life sentences wasted money by forcing the
incarceration of those over the age of 50, by which time most criminal
careers were winding down. He also thought building massive new regional
prisons for violent offenders would strain resources.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Chile lights way for its neighbours: Stephen Fidler reports
on a Latin American country that has turned the economic corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Eduardo Frei's government takes over in Chile next month facing a
set of economic problems most Latin American governments wish they had.
Growth is forecast to slow to 4 per cent this year as a result of depressed
export markets, from 6 per cent last year and 10.3 per cent in 1992.
Little change is expected in overall economic policy. 'Chile is the one
country in Latin America that really has turned the corner,' says a senior
World Bank official.
Many Chileans shrink from offering their experience as a model, given its
genesis in the 17-year military regime of General Augusto Pinochet. The
importance of authoritarian government to economic success is as yet
unproven.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance minister, argues that military
regimes are inherently unstable. 'Consensus policies should work better in
the long run. They should provide more stability - military governments
always end up being thrown out of power.'
Stability is a strong theme emerging from conversations with Chile's
economic policy-makers. Mr Roberto Zahler, president of the independent
central bank, says consistency and transparency of policy have been
important concerns, among other things, promoting savings and investment.
'We give lots of weight to stability, to soundness, to avoiding stop-go
policies.'
Mr Gert Rosenthal, head of the Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin
America, argues that Chile has been the guiding light for many of the
region's market-oriented economic policies.
'Basically Latin America is copying the Chilean model in terms of export
orientation. Countries are looking at private pension fund programmes, at
policies of fiscal restraint, at establishing an autonomous central bank and
at macroeconomic management.'
Mr Foxley says there are elements that would be valid for almost any
country. 'Fiscal discipline, opening up the economy, a body of policies that
allows the private sector to feel it can do its own thing. But I'd add
another point: the importance of the role of the government - in ensuring
public investment in infrastructure and the importance of generating enough
revenue to be able to devote a lot of resources to investment in the social
sectors.'
Other important aspects of Chilean policy may be less appreciated. One has
been managing the exchange rate to keep it as competitive as possible. This
contrasts with Mexican and Argentine policies which have aimed at tackling
inflation in part by keeping the exchange rate strong.
The Chilean government has accepted the downside of this - that inflation
will come down more slowly than otherwise. 'We are not attempting to
stabilise prices instantaneously,' says Mr Zahler. 'We are in the process of
a gradual, consistent, steady reduction in the rate of inflation.'
Chile has also avoided the worst of the problems faced by other Latin
American economies in coping with capital inflows. Many have been stuck in a
policy conundrum: capital inflows led to appreciation of the domestic
currency, generating increases in money supply. This has brought
inflationary pressure. Yet if the government tries to mop up extra liquidity
(by selling government debt) interest rates rise, deterring productive
investment and encouraging further capital inflows.
Chile has managed to avoid this by keeping exchange controls in place, to
the chagrin of some brokers and foreign investors. These have slowed capital
inflows and reduced pressure for the exchange rate to appreciate. 'In
respect of capital controls, I think a lot of countries would be well
advised to follow the Chilean model,' says Mr Rosenthal.
By encouraging exports, it has also established a good environment for
investment in the production of tradeable goods, providing in turn a base
for export growth.
Investment in some countries has been driven by 'a casino mentality', says
Mr Rosenthal. In others, Argentina for example, economists worry that while
there has been direct investment, it has been in services, utilities and
local consumer industries - goods that have provided no base for future
exports. Part of the reason for this, they argue, is that Argentina's strong
exchange rate has made its exports expensive.
Investment in Chile surpassed 27 per cent of gross domestic product last
year, the highest in Latin America. Foreign investors have also been
encouraged by a perception that public administration is not hugely corrupt.
'One aspect in their decision-making that foreign investors always mention
is that we have a reasonably efficient public administration. The general
tone is one of probity, and for someone looking around for a place to
invest, it's a strong point in our favour,' says Mr Foxley.
Investment, however, has been financed mainly by domestic savings, which at
21 per cent of GDP, are the region's highest. This has reduced its
dependence on foreign inflows and allowed it to maintain capital controls.
Although the rising current account deficit does imply a higher dependence
on foreign capital, most economists see it as short-term and easily
financed.
Savings have been encouraged by several factors, including Chile's private
pension fund arrangements, which are being copied elsewhere in Latin America
and which have also helped to develop the domestic capital market.
According to Mr Zahler of the central bank, another important explanation
has been indexation. This has assured Chileans that inflation will not erode
their savings, although it has also increased inflationary inertia. 'In an
economy with such a long history of inflation . . . indexation has been
crucial for the financial system and in developing savings.'
The other factor, he suggests, is growth. 'When you have expectations that
the economy will go on growing, then people tend to save.'
Not everything is rosy. While unemployment has dropped to around 4.5 per
cent, its lowest in 20 years, many of the jobs are low paid and of poor
quality. The country is also still over-dependent on raw materials: only 20
per cent of its exports are manufactured goods, though the figure is rising.
Its health and education systems are in great need of reform, Mr Foxley
says.
Yet so uncontroversial has overall economic policy become in Chile, the new
government has the chance to address these important issues.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Dutch output slips 1.5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch manufacturing output fell a provisional 1.5 per cent on average in
1993 compared with 1992, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said. In
December, manufacturing output dropped 2.2 per cent on the previous month,
giving a 0.3 per cent rise year-on-year. Last year was the first since 1982
that manufacturing output fell compared with the previous year, the CBS
said. After dropping 1.2 per cent in 1982, output increased by an average
2.7 per cent a year from 1983 to 1992. In the chemical industry, last year's
output dropped more than 3 per cent against 1992 and in the metal sector it
was down almost 3 per cent. Lower imports helped cut Austria's 1993 trade
deficit by 8.1 per cent to Sch97.7bn. Exports fell 4.2 per cent to
Sch467.2bn. Imports fell 4.9 per cent to Sch564.9bn.
Finland's GDP will grow 2 per cent this year following last year's 2.5 per
cent fall, the finance ministry said. GDP would rise 5 per cent in 1995.
Foreign currency reserves in the Czech banking system reached Dollars 6.4bn
in February, up from Dollars 6.29bn at the end of 1993, the Czech National
Bank said.

Poland's parliamentary budget committee yesterday approved the 1994 draft
budget, paving the way for an IMF-negotiated debt reduction programme with
the Paris Club of western creditors, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The Z83,000bn budget, already approved by the IMF, represents a public
deficit of 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product. It is central to the
IMF-negotiated agreement to reduce Poland's Dollars 33bn debt by 20 per
cent. The budget still has to go to the full chamber for approval but
yesterday's decision is likely to undermine a campaign on the left of the
governing coalition for higher spending.

FT  17 FEB 94 / EU steelmakers to appeal against Commission fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European steelmakers reacted angrily last night to fines of Ecu104.4m
(Pounds 78.9m) imposed on 16 companies by the European Commission for
allegedly operating a cartel in steel beams used in the construction
industry.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, said the
company would be appealing against the decision, probably to the European
Court of Justice. British Steel, seen by the Commission as one of the
ringleaders, faces the heaviest fine of the 16 steelmakers - Ecu32m (Pounds
24.3m).
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, said: 'German
steel companies will not accept this decision silently. They will instead
defend themselves in front of the European Court of Justice and show that
all principles of free competition have been respected.'
The steelmakers are upset both by the timing of the decision and the
judgment itself. Following dawn raids by the Commission's competition
directorate in 1991, a judgment against the companies was made in 1992, but
no fines were announced.
One steelmaker says it had heard nothing from the Commission on the matter
for a year until this week's 'controlled leak'. This threatened to add
further controversy ahead of Tuesday's crucial meeting between heads of the
big producers and the Commission. The industry clearly believes the leak was
intended to put pressure on it to agree to much-needed capacity cuts.
The Commission says that after 1988 - when the so-called manifest crisis
regime in the industry ended - the industry was repeatedly told to cease
cartel practices in beams and girders. The industry says it repeatedly
sought guidance from the Commission on the legality of inter-company
discussions.
According to British Steel, from mid-1988 the Commission authorised a
framework of market monitoring. The UK producer rebuts the Commission's
comments on market sharing - it says it increased its deliveries of beams to
Continental markets nearly eight-fold between 1986 and 1993.
Mr Moffat said British Steel wanted the Commission to be given the authority
to vet subsidy cases before the aid is granted rather than retrospectively
as occurs now. He said the company would not contribute to the capacity cuts
fund if the subsidies issue was not resolved satisfactorily.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Swiss voters threaten to buck traffic trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Picture the scene. An elegant chamois buck stands nobly on a mountain
hillside against a background of Alpine flowers and a lorry-choked motorway.
He implores you to vote 'Ja' in a referendum on Sunday to force all transit
lorries off the road and on to the rails.
Nothing tugs at the Swiss heart as much as a combination of Alps and wild
animals, as the designers of this campaign poster know. And it seems there
is a fair chance that a majority of Swiss will heed the buck's call.
The referendum, which arises from a petition by residents of Alpine
communities four years ago, asks voters simply 'to protect the Alpine region
from transit traffic'.
The fine print stipulates that approval would mean a ban on all lorries in
international transit (as opposed to those on local or import-export
journeys) from Swiss roads. It would also prohibit the government from
extending or enlarging motorways on transit routes.
If a majority votes in favour of the so-called Alp Initiative, relations
between Bern and the European Union, already strained by Swiss voters'
refusal to join the European Economic Area 14 months ago, would become
frosty indeed. Imposing a lorry transit ban, even after a 10-year transition
period as the petitioners are demanding, would undermine a 12-year EU-Swiss
transit treaty that came into force only last year.
A vote to ban could also affect the European Union enlargement negotiations.
Austrians, whose Alpine instincts are as strong as those of the Swiss, could
become more obdurate in opposing Brussels' attempts to ease lorry transit
restrictions in their country.
The mood in Bern this week is sombre, as government leaders acknowledge
their failure to weaken the attractions of the Alp Initiative.
No opinion polls have been taken - partly because it is perceived to be an
issue on which people might lie about their intentions - but everyone
expects the outcome to be close.
The vote takes place against the background of inexorably rising lorry
traffic through the Gotthard pass, which bisects Switzerland. Since the
Gotthard road tunnel opened in 1980, daily traffic on this most convenient
route between Germany and Italy has risen 30 times to 2,500 lorries a day,
of which 40 per cent are in transit. The Swiss government is expecting a
further surge to 6,000 by 2000.
For the occasional hiker, it is annoying to reach the peaks towering over
the Reuss valley which leads up to the Gotthard pass and still hear the
thunder of lorries far below. But for the residents of the canton of Uri,
most of whom live and work cheek by jowl with the motorway in this narrow
valley, the noise and fumes have become intolerable.
Apart from the chamois buck, the most memorable image of this campaign is of
a tearful Uri woman showing her asthmatic son on television.
The government is sympathetic. Two years ago, it held out firmly against
Brussels' demands that Swiss lorry weight limits be raised from 28 tonnes to
the European Union 40 tonne norm. It also restricts transit lorries to
weekday daytime operation.
These constraints have already shifted 90 per cent of transit traffic to the
rails, it points out. Thus, there is no need for further restrictions that
would probably provoke EU retaliation.
The Alp Initiative backers see things differently. A ban would encourage
other countries to follow Switzerland's lead, they say, and would ensure
that the new SFr20bn (Pounds 9.2bn) Gotthard rail tunnel that Switzerland is
to build will attract plenty of business.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Moscow devolves power to Tatarstan republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow has ceded extensive financial and other powers to Tatarstan, one of
its richest and most independent-minded republics, hailing the move as a
model for others in the Russian federation to follow.
Details of the deal, signed on Tuesday by President Yeltsin and President
Mintimer Shamiyev of Tatarstan, will emerge tomorrow when the treaty is
debated in the Duma. However, it appears that Moscow has allowed Tatarstan
to retain its own constitution, unamended - a constitution in which Russia
is mentioned only three times, once as a 'neighbouring state', and where
full sovereignty including the right to veto Russian legislation is vested
in Tatarstan.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the minister responsible for the regions, admitted
yesterday that the Tatar constitution would stay and that it would be 'a
long time' before the Tatar parliament amended it to be consonant with the
Russian constitution. However, he said that Tatarstan's demand to decide
what share of taxes it sends to Moscow had been turned down though the
federal government would take a relatively small share of locally-raised
taxes.
According to newspaper reports, Mr Shamiyev admitted that the resignation of
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier in charge of finance, had made
agreement possible - presumably because he had objected to the financial
arrangements in the treaty.
Mr Yeltsin, commenting that the agreement had been 'hard-won', nevertheless
said it was 'a completely new kind of act'. Mr Shakhrai said the model could
be used for other 'problem' regions and republics within Russia - such as
Chechnya, where General Dzhokar Dudayev, the president, has declared
independence; and in the Kaliningrad region in Russia's extreme north-west,
where the local authorities have declared a customs-free zone.
The deal is also being seen as a model beyond the Russian Federation. Mr
Valerian Advadze, the Georgian ambassador in Moscow, said yesterday that the
treaty could become a model for his country in attempting to strike an
agreement with the breakaway region of Abkhazia, where fierce fighting raged
until Georgian troops were expelled last September.
The agreement has saved Russia from the embarrassment of having an important
republic with 5m people nearly half of them ethnic Russians, effectively
outside the federation. However, the concessions made may in future threaten
the integrity of Russia - if other regions and republics demand the same
terms.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Belarussians look to rouble tie to save them: Leyla Boulton
on a plan which critics say would amount to Russia subsidising an
unreconstructed neighbour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Socialism lives on here. Who in the west would feed us like Russia does?'
asked Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, governor of the central bank of Belarus,
the former Soviet republic that is hoping to consummate a rouble marriage
with its giant neighbour as soon as possible.
But as he watched demonstrators march past his window in protest against a
currency union plan which has also been attacked by Russian reformers, he
admitted that too many people in Belarus, including its neo-communist
government, were under the illusion 'that this monetary union will save
them'.
Final agreement is awaiting a decision by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
Russian prime minister, on Belarus demands for the deal to include
subsidised energy and a favourable exchange rate for replacing its surrogate
currency, the hare, with the Russian rouble.
Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank
chairman who would take over many of Mr Bogdankevich's responsibilities if
the deal goes through, claim it will help Russian companies by restoring old
Soviet-era trading links.
Along with making Belarus follow Russian monetary, fiscal, and trade policy,
the proposed treaty would abolish all customs barriers between the two
countries. Politically, it would make Belarus, traditionally the least
independent-minded republic in the former Soviet Union, abandon much of its
sovereignty to its neighbour.
Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belarus prime minister who has failed to introduce
any significant market reforms and now wants to restore Soviet-era price
controls to deal with inflation that is twice as high as in Russia, claimed
the deal represented the republic's 'only chance of survival'.
But critics of the agreement in Russia, such as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
former finance minister who believes the parliament will block it, say
Russia cannot afford to take on the subsidisation of an unreconstructed
neighbour. Even the Belarus side, claiming they spend more money maintaining
Russian troops on Belarus soil, have valued the Russian energy subsidies it
wants at Dollars 1.4bn a year.
Mr Vladimir Karyagin, who heads a Belarus entrepreneurs' union, fears that
in finalising the deal, the two governments will focus on helping large
state-owned factories at the expense of his country's fledgling private
business sector.
Mr Bogdankevich, whose pleas for bolder reform have so far fallen on deaf
ears in the government, said that monetary union, if accompanied by
subsidised energy for Belarus companies, would offer 'sensible new rulers' a
golden opportunity to restructure and privatise the economy.
'But you cannot conduct reforms if the government is not up to them,' he
said, doubting the opportunity would be taken up, at least not before fresh
elections, which are being demanded by the opposition.
Although a meek response to a general strike call, the demonstration by a
few thousand protestors last Tuesday illustrated the discontent simmering
among the republic's 10m inhabitants. Saying that many workers had been
frightened away from the protest by the government and their managers, the
demonstrators complained about ferocious inflation, low pay and ailing
factories. They demanded early elections for both parliament and a new post
of president to sweep out a leadership dominated by old-style party
bureaucrats.
'Our government is trying to save itself by joining the rouble zone, which
we do not need,' said Mikhail, a worker at an electronics plant. 'But we
would join a dollar zone any day.'
Having kept this industrialised republics' state-owned enterprises going
with inflationary cheap credits, the government last year boasted that
industrial production had fallen only 10 per cent in 1993. But the results
of its refusal to reform are now catching up with it. Industrial enterprises
which have continued to function without being forced to become more
efficient are experiencing a fall in production much greater than in Russia.
Industrial output fell by 39 per cent in January alone compared with January
1992, and inflation for January was about 40 per cent, double the Russian
rate. Factories are grinding to a halt and workers fear they will be laid
off even without restructuring.
With only 3 per cent of state-owned industry and agriculture in private
hands, and a discount rate the same as Russia's despite inflation being
twice as high, Mr Bogdankevich's hopes that a union could push Belarus into
starting reforms seem at least optimistic.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Craxi pursues communist vendetta: Former Italian premier
tries to tarnish the left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader facing an array of corruption
charges, has celebrated the second anniversary of the Milan magistrates'
anti-corruption crusade by handing the authorities a dossier on the illicit
financing of his political enemies on the left.
The vendetta is aimed at Italy's former Communist party and its heir, the
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) in an attempt to tarnish the PDS with the
same corrupt image as the other traditional parties in the run-up to the
March elections.
The dossier may lead to investigation of several senior PDS politicians. Mr
Massimo D'Alema, the PDS number two, yesterday called on Rome magistrates at
his own initiative to clarify the matter.
Later Mr D'Alema said Mr Craxi was being sued for libel, adding: 'It is
unheard of in any civilised country for a politician to go and denounce his
adversaries with baseless accusations.'
Throughout the corruption scandals, the PDS has sought to distance itself
from the behaviour of the post-war ruling parties. Party officials have
insisted those members charged with corruption were marginal players.
Party members accused of corruption or illicit party financing have always
claimed they were acting in a personal capacity. This was the case this week
when Mr Renato Morandina, a councillor in the Veneto region, admitted
receiving L200m (Pounds 81,030) from a Fiat subsidiary.
Mr Craxi and some of his colleagues claim the magistrates have been soft on
the left. This is also the view of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's
election propaganda. Mr Berlusconi recently secured for his Forza Italia
movement the candidature of Ms Tiziana Parenti, who was forced out of the
Milan magistrates' investigative team. She says this was because she
investigated too aggressively the affairs of the PDS.
Mr Craxi is determined to prove the Communists (PCI) received substantial
funds from Moscow and enjoyed illicit financial support through deals with
party-controlled co-operatives in northern Italy. In turn he has justified
the taking of bribes by Socialists by the need to raise funds to fight
communism.
Since the scandals broke two years ago, 2,993 have been arrested, and 338
deputies are under investigation.
Yesterday parliament agreed to waive immunity on Mr Gianni De Michelis, the
former Socialist foreign minister, and Mr Gianni Prandini, the Christian
Democrat former transport minister, to face corruption charges.

Switzerland will appeal to France's top administrative tribunal in a bid to
prove that Paris violated international law by refusing to extradite two
Iranians accused of murdering a leading opposition figure. The Swiss justice
minister said France broke European extradition treaties when it returned
the two suspects, Sharif Esfahani and Ahmad Taheri, to Iran in December,
rather than handing them over to Swiss authorities.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Bundesbank warns over public debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The indebtedness of the entire German public sector is likely to reach
almost DM2,000bn (Pounds 785bn) or roughly 60 per cent of gross domestic
product by the end of the current year, from 56 per cent the year before,
the Bundesbank warned yesterday.
The public sector debt is therefore 'approaching by leaps and bounds' the
critical point according to the economic convergence criteria laid down in
the Maastricht treaty, which sets a debt ceiling of 60 per cent of GDP for
member states of the European Union seeking to create an economic and
monetary union.
Germany is already outside the Maastricht criteria as far as the narrowly
defined public sector deficit is concerned, with net borrowing running at
3.4 per cent of GDP in 1993, according to the central bank's latest monthly
report. The Maastricht criterion for the public deficit is 3.0 per cent.
By the end of last year, the total public sector debt had reached DM1,510bn,
or 48.5 per cent of GDP, compared with DM1,345bn, or 44.5 per cent at the
end of 1992, the report says.
If the outstanding debts of the German railways are included, as well as the
liabilities of the Treuhand privatisation agency in east Germany, the public
debt at the end of last year amounts to DM1.74bn, or 56 per cent of GDP. The
railways debt burden falls on the central exchequer from last January 1,
while the Treuhand's liabilities will be taken over from January 1, 1995.
The Bundesbank's calculations confirm those of private sector economists,
who have warned about the 'mountain of debt' being accumulated by the entire
German public sector, as a result of the costs of German unification,
compounded by the current sharp recession.
The latest analysis by the Dresdner Bank, for example, estimates that the
debt burden will rise over DM2,000bn in the course of the year, with the
inclusion of the Treuhand debt, and the assumption of part of the debts of
the east German housing sector, estimated at DM400bn.
The Dresdner Bank warns that without far more drastic cuts in public
expenditure than the recent DM25bn savings package for 1994 - it suggests at
least DM70bn - it will be impossible even to stabilise the debt at that
level.
In spite of its gloomy prognosis, the Bundesbank remains moderately
complimentary about the efforts of the public authorities to curb their
spending but reiterates that continuing rigorous savings measures must focus
on spending cuts, and not tax rises.
It warns that recessionary tendencies in the economy have still not been
entirely overcome.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Miners lead strike wave in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A series of strikes and strike threats are now rippling across Russia,
evidence of a growing militancy in face of non-payment of wages, reductions
in workforces and plunging morale.
The coal miners, traditionally the most militant group in Russia as
elsewhere, have staged stoppages in the Arctic region of Vorkuta and in the
larger Kuzbass coal basin. However, a wider strike expected to be called on
Tuesday has been delayed, as divisions emerged on the council of the
Independent Miners' Union about how far political demands should be
advanced.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, promised the Kuzbass men on
Tuesday to pay Rbs1,500bn in back wages in order to avert action in the
basin.
More seriously for the government, oil workers in Nizhnevartovsk, centre of
the Tyumen oil producing region, have voted for a strike which will be
called by a strike committee 'if the situation requires'. The oil workers
claim they have not been paid their salaries, of around Rbs500,000 a month,
for three months.
Thousands of teachers at institutes of higher education went on strike
yesterday, also protesting against non-payment of wages and citing rapidly
worsening conditions in the colleges. They demanded payment in full of all
wages and that the government fulfil its promises to index the low pay rates
to inflation.
In Moscow, the city's ambulance service workers, who include doctors in
their ranks, have decided to strike from March 1.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Upturn on track despite jobless rise, says Clarke: Inflation
increases but stays within target - Retail sales grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday shrugged off fears that the UK
recovery was running out of steam, in spite of a sharp rise in unemployment
last month.
The jobless figures follow monthly falls in manufacturing output and
industrial production reported earlier this week, which cast a shadow over
the pace of economic expansion. But the pessimism was partly offset by other
economic statistics showing that inflation remains under firm control and
retail sales are buoyant.
In spite of the conflicting messages, the chancellor said he was 'quite
confident' the economy was still on course.
Although the annual inflation rate in January rose to 2.5 per cent from 1.9
per cent in December, this was a smaller increase than had been expected.
Retail sales showed a 0.6 per cent month-on-month improvement.
The stock market rose yesterday as traders anticipated that the poor
unemployment figures might encourage the government to cut base rates again.
The FT-SE 100 index ended 24.5 points higher at 3,417.7, while long gilts
added a quarter of a point against the trend in European bond markets. The
pound lost a pfennig but closed slightly higher on the day at DM2.5471.
The number of people without jobs and claiming benefit increased by a
seasonally adjusted 15,500 in January, after falling by 149,800 in the
previous four months. This took unemployment to a total of 2.787m, compared
with 2.99m a year ago.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, insisted that the trend in
unemployment remained downwards, but said the path was likely to be uneven,
especially over holiday periods. 'The pattern appears to be a repeat of what
happened over the summer holidays. The trend is still downwards but large
falls in some months are followed by small rises in other months,' he said.
However, a number of economists said the latest figures pointed to slack in
the labour market. 'The rise in unemployment, the fall in vacancies and
weakness of overtime, strikes and weekly hours worked all point to a weak
economy,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities.
Further signs of economic fragility were highlighted by the state of public
sector finances. The surplus in January, when the government benefits from
seasonal payments of corporation tax, was the lowest since 1979, when
monthly statistics were first published. This was partly due to
disappointing tax receipts.
However, the retail sales figures painted a brighter picture of demand than
a recent Confederation of British Industry survey.
'Fears over the pace of recovery are misplaced,' said Mr John Marsland,
economist at UBS. 'Sales volumes are growing at annualised rates in excess
of 3 per cent, and this should be sustained despite tax increases.'
Excluding mortgage rates, inflation in January was 2.8 per cent, up from 2.7
per cent in December but well within the 1-4 per cent target range.

FT  17 FEB 94 / US groups win Dollars 6bn Saudi airliner order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has won a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) deal to modernise Saudi Arabia's
airline fleet with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft, dealing a heavy
blow to their European rival, Airbus Industrie.
The order for about 50 airliners, announced by President Bill Clinton
yesterday with an unusual White House fanfare, follows a year of intense
lobbying by many in the US cabinet. Mr Clinton said the work would create
60,000 jobs in the US.
The White House's direct involvement in clinching the order is expected to
heighten trade tensions between the US and Europe over the overt use of
political pressure to win commercial aircraft sales.
Saudi Arabia's decision to choose US manufacturers over Airbus to supply
Saudia, its national airline, is a particularly significant setback for the
Airbus consortium, which had hoped to win much of the order.
Big commercial aircraft orders are still rare because of the financial
difficulties faced by many airlines.
However, Airbus, whose partners are British Aerospace (20 per cent),
Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent)
and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent), yesterday said it had still not heard from
Saudia whether its competing offer had been rejected.
'We have as today no indication from Saudia as to whether they accept or
reject our offer of planes, whose validity has been extended to March 1 at
their request,' Airbus said.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said details of the contract, including which
precise aircraft would be supplied, had not been worked out. Prince Bandar
bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said representatives of the
two US aircraft manufacturers would be invited to Riyadh to start
negotiations after the end of Ramadan, around March 20.
McDonnell Douglas has been offering its MD-11 long-range jet while Boeing
has been discussing 747s, its new 777 twin-engine widebody and the smaller
737. Airbus has offered its A340 long-range aircraft and its smaller A320.
At present the Saudia fleet includes aircraft from Boeing, Lockheed and
Airbus.
The negotiations have involved an unprecedented degree of US government
export promotion, cemented by visits to Riyadh by three US cabinet
secretaries and by Mr Clinton's own telephone lobbying of King Fahd. It has
been matched by high-level lobbying by the four European Airbus partner
countries.
Mr Clinton said in the televised announcement that the US administration
would continue to be 'aggressively involved in this kind of (sales)
endeavour when it is appropriate'.
European aerospace industry officials last night said the Saudia deal was
'an important lesson' for Europe, underlining the US's commitment to put
political weight behind big export deals.
'It certainly slams shut the door on the US contention that Europeans have
been putting on political pressure to win Airbus export sales,' a French
official noted.
Confirming the US's aggressive stance, Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary,
said: 'We have finally broken out of the shackles that have caused a
several-decade debate about the role of government. Our international
competitors figured out that role a long time ago, and that's why they are
doing much better.'

FT  17 FEB 94 / Brussels fines British Steel Pounds 24m for market-rigging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER, ANDREW BAXTER and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel was yesterday fined Ecu32m (Pounds 24.3m) for breaking
European rules outlawing price-fixing. The fine was the heaviest single
penalty imposed by the European Commission on 16 leading steelmakers it
found guilty of operating a cartel to supply the construction industry.
The penalties on the 16 totalled a record Ecu 104.4m and were accompanied by
a stiff warning that the Commission would take a tough line against
market-rigging in any industry.
Brussels also issued an ultimatum to private steelmakers over plans for
capacity cuts agreed by EU industry ministers last December.
The commission said the Ecu240m fund to ease the redundancies created by the
restructuring would be withdrawn unless by April the steel companies came up
with the agreed capacity cuts.
The 16 companies were found guilty of infringing all the provisions of
Article 65 of the European Coal and Steel Treaty, which outlaws
price-fixing, market-sharing and exchanging confidential information.
'This was a case when everything that can be infringed has been infringed,'
said Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, justifying the
unprecedented severity of the fines. 'We needed to be tough,' he said,
adding: 'There should no longer be any doubt that the rules of competition
are applicable in this Community.'
Mr Van Miert said the Commission had levied the heaviest fines on 'those who
have sinned repeatedly'. Other ringleaders in the cartel to rig prices for
beams and girders, according to the Commission, were Unimetal, a division of
France's Usinor-Sacilor, fined Ecu12.3m; and Thyssen of Germany, fined
Ecu6.5m.
The Commission's decision was bitterly criticised during angry exchanges in
the House of Commons. MPs of all parties said the judgment was unfair to
British Steel.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, rejected claims that the fines were
linked to the Commission's plans to reduce capacity throughout Europe. Mr
Phillip Oppenheim, a Conservative backbencher, accused the Commission of
rigging the steel market and creating 'a mess of overcapacity'.
German steelmakers and British Steel said they would appeal against the
Commission's judgment to the European Court of Justice. Mr Ruprecht Vondran,
president of the German steel federation, said: 'German steel companies will
not accept this decision silently.'
Under the December deal, state-owned steelmakers in Spain, Germany and Italy
received government subsidies worth Ecu6.8bn in return for capacity cuts of
over 5m tonnes. Non-aided producers, however, are supposed to deliver
capacity cuts of between 19m and 25m tonnes. So far, according to Mr Martin
Bangemann, the industry commissioner, they have delivered 13m tonnes of
cuts, with 4m tonnes more promised.

FT  17 FEB 94 / Mandela acts to avert poll boycott by S African right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday
announced constitutional concessions aimed at averting a rightwing boycott
of South Africa's all-race elections and reducing the threat of violence.
'We must treat the threat of civil war seriously. That is why we have gone
out of our way to make these concessions,' Mr Mandela said after an
emergency meeting of the ANC's policymaking national executive committee.
The concessions would strengthen the powers of provinces under the country's
post-apartheid constitution, but they fall short of the demands of the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party for provincial autonomy.
Mr Rowan Cronje, chairman of the Freedom Alliance which comprises Inkatha
and rightwing whites, said he would ask for a meeting with the ANC today.
Inkatha said it would study the concessions. However, before the ANC
announcement, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, speaking in Cape
Town, outlined a tougher stance. He said he believed the demand by Zulu
king, Goodwill Zwelithini, for an independent Zulu homeland, which Mr
Mandela ruled out, was probably 'irreversible'.
Mr Mandela proposed constitutional changes are aimed at accommodating not
only Inkatha, but also the white rightwing Afrikaner Volksfront, which
demands a homeland for Afrikaners. The concessions include powers of
taxation for provincial governments and a safeguard for the right to
'self-determination' - a key demand of the white right - as well as measures
to protect the powers of provinces when the elected assembly writes a new
constitution to replace the 1993 interim constitution.
These concessions would probably not affect the basic nature of the current
constitution, which provides for strong central government rather than the
federal system demanded by Chief Buthelezi. But they would partly meet Chief
Buthelezi's concerns, and demonstrate the ANC's willingness to consider
compromise.
On provincial powers, Mr Mandela said: 'The matter is on the agenda, and we
are prepared to hammer out a solution.' He said the ANC approved amending
the new constitution to allow consideration of an Afikaner homeland after
the election.
The ANC also dropped its demand for a single-ballot system in the April
26-28 election, and called for multi-party negotiations to be reconvened on
Monday to approve the decision. Separate ballots would be cast in provincial
and national elections, favouring the regional parties.
President FW de Klerk said parliament would be recalled in March to
incorporate the proposed amendments in the constitution and to extend the
deadline for parties to register for elections. Government officials argue
that this should be done, whether or not the right accepts the amendments,
to undermine the right's moral position in boycotting elections.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sip forecasts profits
improvement for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sip, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications utility, expects to
announce 'clearly better' profits for 1993, according to Mr Ernesto Pascale,
chairman.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Pascale forecast that, based on preliminary
figures, Sip's 1993 net earnings should be higher than the L486.4bn (Dollars
288m) made in 1992. The group's official results should be released in early
April.
Mr Pascale made no dividend forecast but implied Sip's payout could go up.
The likelihood of higher profits, in spite of the recession, has been raised
by changes to Sip's heavy investment policy of recent years. The company
said its cash needs in 1993 had been lower than the previous year. Moreover,
a higher proportion of investment spending had been met by internal cash
flow than in 1992, he added. As a result, Sip's net indebtedness at the end
of last year was lower than the L23,283bn reported on December 31 1992.
The letter to shareholders gave no indication of revenues from Sip's highly
lucrative cellular communications services, now the third biggest in Europe
in subscribers. Mr Pascale said Sip viewed the entry of a second mobile
communications operator 'with great serenity'. The impending onset of
competition in the group's hitherto monopoly would help to expand overall
demand, he predicted.

If it was good enough for grandad, it's good enough for us, seems to be the
motto of Ian and James Ivory, a couple of Old Etonian fund managers. Taking
a lead from their grandfather, James Ivory, the Edinburgh-based fund
managers are putting a couple of million pounds of their own money into
their latest vehicle - Stewart Ivory's Ptarmigan International Capital.
James Ivory, the grandfather, founded British Assets and backed his judgment
by investing the family's fortune in it, as did his son, Eric. However, the
latest generation of Ivory's, who have skipped around from Ivory &amp; Sime to
Stewart Ivory via Ivory &amp; Co, are not just following in their grandfather's
footsteps. An old Ivory &amp; Sime colleague, Ian Rushbrook (ex-East Ham
Grammar), owns nearly 30 per cent of Personal Assets, a Pounds 14m
investment trust, and since he took it over in 1990 it's outperformed its
peer group handsomely.
A case of anything Ian can do, Ian Ivory can do better?

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pharma Vision sells its stake in
Ciba-Geigy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pharma Vision 2000, the Swiss pharmaceutical shares investment company, has
arranged to sell its SFr410m (Dollars 283m) stake in Ciba-Geigy because it
disagrees with the Basle-based group's policy to remain diversified in
chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
This decision could have some impact on Ciba shares in the next few days.
Moves by Pharma Vision and other investment vehicles controlled by Mr Martin
Ebner's BZ Bank group are closely watched in Swiss equity markets.
Two weeks ago, BK Vision, another investment company controlled by Mr Ebner
and his associates, revealed it was running down its stake in CS Holding,
the financial group built around Credit Suisse. Since then, CS shares have
been significantly weaker than the Swiss banking sector as a whole.
Mr Christoph Blocher, chairman of Pharma Vision, said in his annual
statement that the company reduced its Ciba holding last year because Ciba
was 'sticking to its strategy of diversification rather than focusing on the
pharmaceutical sector'.
The Pharma Vision annual report showed that most of the remaining holding
had been shifted from registered shares to the more liquid bearer shares.
And Mr Ebner revealed yesterday that BZ Bank had recently placed 400,000
call options on Ciba bearer shares which would provide for the sale of these
shares later this year. The disposal of the Ciba stake would leave Pharma
Vision holding only securities of Roche, another large Swiss pharmaceutical
group. At the end of last year, its investments in Roche shares were worth
SFr3.1bn.
Mr Ebner said Pharma Vision was aiming to buy large stakes in one or two
non-Swiss pharmaceutical groups over the next few months. In preparation, it
was raising SFr530m in a 1-for-5 rights issue at SFr4,250 per bearer share
and SFr850 per registered share. This was in addition to SFr310.8m raised
from a rights issue last September.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Russian troops told to defy UN: Yeltsin administration says
orders must be cleared with Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian troops under United Nations command in former Yugoslavia have been
told not to obey orders from their UN superiors until they are cleared by
Moscow, according to officials in President Boris Yeltsin's administration.
This emerged as Mr Yeltsin raised strong objections yesterday to the threat
of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs in his first public comments on the
Nato ultimatum issued last week.
Presidential officials said at least one order to Russian troops in former
Yugoslavia had already been countermanded.
This was when Russian troops in eastern Croatia refused an order to move
nearer to the front line around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
This attitude was underlined by Russian deputy foreign minister Vitaly
Churkin. On his way back from a visit to Bosnia, he said it was unthinkable
that Russian troops should reinforce peacekeepers in Sarajevo while Moscow
was not part of the decision-making process in Bosnia.
Speaking after talks in Moscow with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr
Yeltsin warned Nato it would not succeed in ending the conflict without full
Russian agreement.
But Mr Yeltsin held back from outright rejection of the Nato ultimatum to
the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or
face air strikes. British officials said the Russian president was keeping
his options open if air strikes were launched after the deadline for the
Bosnian Serbs to comply runs out at midnight on Sunday. Mr Yeltsin has made
it clear he sees air strikes as a last resort.
The Russian president, who appeared angry at the precedent set by the west
in issuing a unilateral military warning, told journalists at the Kremlin:
'Some people are trying to resolve the issue on Bosnia without the agreement
of Russia. This will not succeed.'
But he did not explicitly demand that the UN Security Council pass another
resolution before launching military action. And he also threw Russia's
weight behind efforts to lift the siege of Sarajevo.
He did, however, draw a distinction between air strikes called in defence of
UN forces in Bosnia - which Moscow approved - and the wider remit of the
Nato decision. He warned the west against trying to impose a military
solution to a conflict that could only be ended at the negotiating table. He
added: 'Russia will take part actively in talks to bring a peaceful
solution.'
Mr Major, the first Nato leader to meet Mr Yeltsin since the air strikes
ultimatum was issued, was anxious to reassure his host. He told journalists:
'Before air strikes proceed on this very limited front there would need to
be a reference back, under previously agreed Security Council resolutions,
to the secretary-general.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / Abu Dhabi in talks to improve returns for BCCI creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, is considering an agreement with the
liquidators that would provide a greater return to hundreds of thousands of
creditors around the world.
Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, chairman of the working group on BCCI for the
majority shareholder, said that he wanted to see creditors receive more
money to compensate them for delays in any payout since the bank was closed
by regulators in July 1991.
It has also emerged that a predecessor firm of Ernst &amp; Young, who were
principal auditors to BCCI until 1986, highlighted serious concerns at the
bank with audit verification, internal auditing and the need for a single
worldwide auditor in 1979.
Abu Dhabi has held intense negotiations with the liquidators to BCCI in the
last few weeks following the rejection by the Luxembourg appeal court last
October of a previous agreement.
Abu Dhabi would prefer to reach a negotiated settlement rather than pursue
lengthy legal actions against BCCI and its liquidators which could drag on
for many years and sustain prolonged and politically embarrassing coverage
of the case.
'We are a nation not a corporation,' said Mr Mazrui. 'Things have changed .
. . we have waited for two years, corporations have suffered, families are
not eating steak any more. There should be some compensation. We are
flexible on that score. We like to have friends not enemies. We don't want
to leave any bad feelings.'
Mr Mazrui, who sat on the boards of BCCI companies from 1981, maintained Abu
Dhabi's position that it was unaware of the fraud at the bank until April
1990 when Mr Swaleh Navqi, BCCI's chief executive, made the first of a
series of confessions.
'I can say from now till the Day of Judgment from what I can see no one on
the board knew about the fraud. We never, never suspected,' he said.
A new agreement is unlikely to involve Abu Dhabi providing additional money
to creditors. Instead, it is believed to be considering waiving and
restructuring some of its claims.
These include a Dollars 2.2bn investment portfolio managed by BCCI which was
stolen to stem losses generated within the bank, Dollars 400m in deposits
from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the assets of BCCI's operations
in the United Arab Emirates.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Italians split over 'tainted' candidates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italy's scandal-tainted ruling parties are divided over whether to allow
politicians under investigation for corruption to stand as candidates in
next month's general election.
The problem mostly concerns southern Italy where the long-ruling Christian
Democrat and Socialist parties have a formidable network of patronage. While
up to 80 per cent of the outgoing legislature is expected to retire, many
southern politicians are refusing to stand down.
Mr Ciriaco De Mita, the former Christian Democrat prime minister, ex-party
secretary and unquestioned boss of the region south of Naples round Avellino
and Irpinia, is insisting on standing in his native Irpinia for the Popular
Party (PPI), the renamed Christian Democrats.
This has deeply embarrassed some members of the PPI and threatens a rift
with the PPI's principal electoral ally - the Pact for Italy of Mr Mario
Segni, leader of the referendum movement.
Others in the PPI argue that southern politics have not been subjected to
the same renewal as in the north and that the verdict on candidates should
be left with the voters. They maintain that individuals who have not yet
been sent for trial should be allowed to be candidates. Behind this lies the
cynical calculation that in the south the old bosses have the best chance of
winning seats under the new first-past-the-post system.
Mr De Mita has been involved in investigations ranging from alleged illicit
party financing and corruption to extortion. The most serious relate to
L12,000bn (Dollars 7.1bn) government disaster relief for the 1980 Irpinia
earthquake. He is alleged to have threatened owners of three companies with
losing their disaster relief if they refused to take on employees
recommended by him.
But last week 77 per cent of the PPI members in Irpinia voted for Mr De Mita
to represent the constituency.
Another case has involved Mr Nicola Mancino, the Christian Democrat interior
minister from Avellino. He has been questioned about receiving illicit funds
from the intelligence services, a charge he has denied.
He is considered an asset by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the PPI leader, and has
been asked to stand again. But Mr Segni opposes scandal-tainted candidates
in principle.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Romanian banker sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dan Pascariu, Romania's leading commercial banker, was last night sacked
as president of the state-owned Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, after
losing a long-running battle with conservatives within the ruling left-wing
Party of Social Democracy in Romania.
Mr Pascariu had attempted to resist government pressure to finance imports
for insolvent state companies and to grant low-interest credits to the
central bank and finance ministry. He becomes the latest reformer to be
forced out of a senior position. 'This is very serious,' said a senior
London-based banker. 'Dan is honest, professional and highly respected in
international banking circles.'
Under Mr Pascariu the RBST joined the ranks of the world's top 400 banks and
consolidated its position as one of Romania's most profitable companies. It
has declared a provisional pre-tax profit of Dollars 46m for 1993. Mr
Pascariu has been replaced by Mr Razvan Temesan, previously first
vice-president.

FT  16 FEB 94 / EU chides Norway on whaling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway has yet to 'grasp an outstretched hand' extended by the European
Commission which could bring a compromise over the country's highly
controversial whaling policy, a major sticking point in European Union
accession negotiations, a Commission official said in Oslo yesterday.
Mr Laurens Brinkhorst, director of DG11, in charge of the Commission's
environmental affairs, suggested a way around the issue - should Norway join
the EU - would be to allow its whalers to continue culling of the minke
whale for a two-year period, after which the policy would be reviewed.
However, neither member states nor Norway seem prepared to accept the
Commission's suggestion.
Norway last May announced that it would allow killing of minke whales in
defiance of an eight-year ban by the International Whaling Commission.
'The Commission is trying to stretch out a hand to Norway but it is not
being grasped,' Mr Brinkhorst said.

FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market regains a measure of
composure - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four days of big losses in the UK equity market - totalling 76 points - were
brought to a halt yesterday as share prices rallied strongly on the back of
a bear squeeze and the continuing rally on Wall Street.
The FT-SE 100 index closed at the day's best level of 3,393.2, up 29.7.
Second-line stocks put on a more muted performance, the FT-SE Mid 250 rising
17.9 at 4,028.5.
'There's been an element of decoupling between equities and gilts today,
which has been seen as bullish for equities,' said a leading marketmaker at
one of the European securities houses.
The US market gained ground during London trading hours, rising 18 points on
the Dow Jones Average and continuing the good performance in recent
sessions. It was pointed out that the US index had almost recouped all the
ground it lost in the single session when the Federal Reserve tightened
monetary policy by increasing its Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points.
US bonds were said to have improved yesterday. Gilts closed above the day's
lows after disappointing industrial output numbers for December increased
hopes of a rate cut. The data showed manufacturing output down 0.5 per cent
against most economists' forecasts of a rise of some 0.3 per cent.
The lower output figure plus a disappointing survey of UK distributive
trades released by the Confederation of British Industry were said to have
increased hopes that a further 25 basis points reduction in UK interest
rates may be under consideration. The CBI survey indicated that UK consumer
spending was showing signs of faltering ahead of the tax increases scheduled
to impact from April.
Today brings another batch of crucial economic details, notably inflation
figures for January. NatWest Securities is forecasting unchanged
month-on-month inflation, and headline inflation of 2.9 per cent, with
underlying inflation of 3.2 per cent. Unemployment figures for January are
expected to show a fall of between 23,000 to 30,000.
UK share prices began the session in good form, stimulated by the good
showing by Wall Street overnight and relatively undisturbed by the latest
fall of the Tokyo market. Strong support for FT-SE futures helped the cash
market build on its firm opening, with professional traders running short
positions said to have been sufficiently worried by the market's opening
strength to have closed them out.
Confidence in the market grew through the session, with dealers noting signs
that some of the bears had scrambled to buy stock towards the close of
trading, when Wall Street was in full flow and the FT-SE 100 advancing
rapidly.
'There was too much downside hysteria in the market at the start of the
week; it only needed Wall Street to move ahead and that's exactly what has
happened,' said one senior dealer.
He also pointed out that the Hong Kong market had staged a good rally
yesterday and was expected to continue to move up this morning.
HSBC and Standard Chartered were among the FT-SE 100's best performers
yesterday.
One disappointment for the market was the level of business transacted,
although again this was said to result from the severe weather problems
affecting the City. Turnover reached 771.2m shares. Customer business on
Monday was Pounds 1.45bn, well down on recent levels.

FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo jumped 14 to 665p ahead of interim figures
tomorrow as several houses pointed out the yield benefits and US sellers
stayed away.
Hoare Govett reiterated its buy stance and its forecast of a 21 per cent
hike in the dividend to 8.5p, in the middle of a one penny range. The house
predicts interim profits of Pounds 970m. Lehman Brothers, the US house,
stressed its preference for the stock over SmithKline Beecham, which fell 4
to 411p. Lehman cut its 1993 forecast for SmithKline to Pounds 1.180bn from
Pounds 1.209bn and reduced earnings per share to 29.4p from 30.2p. It
reduced its 1994 estimate by Pounds 90m to Pounds 1.255bn and earnings per
share to 31.2p from 33.3p.
Mr Ian Smith of Lehman said: 'This sector is focusing on yield as opposed to
earnings growth and the two-point differential between SmithKline and Glaxo
is starting to stand out.' However, Nomura argued that the market was
ignoring the declining sales momentum of Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer
treatment which represented 44 per cent of sales in 1993.
The strong market trend helped British Airways recover from an early retreat
after several brokers downgraded full year profit expectations following
third quarter figures.
The shares initially eased 8 to 466p, before recovering to close a penny off
at 473p, in trade of 10m, after the group revealed a threefold increase in
profits to Pounds 65m.
However, Mr Mike Stoddart at Charterhouse Tilney, who reduced his full year
forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 300m said the figures were below his
expectations, adding: 'The company continues to talk about excess capacity
in the industry'. Strauss Turnbull reduced its figure by Pounds 45m to
arrive at the same forecast. But Nikko Securities was said to have
appreciated the figures and is believed to have upgraded.
One of the property market's biggest bulls, agency broker James Capel,
turned down the heat slightly as it took a number of the sector's most
ebullient stocks off its buy list. Mr Andrew Causer at Capel said that
certain stocks, such as MEPC, Brixton, British Land and Slough Estates,
which in some cases have quadrupled in value, needed to pause for breath
until rental growth rates in 1995-96 could be confidentially predicted. MEPC
steadied at 514p, Slough slipped 2 to 288p, British Land 5 to 443p and
Brixton 2 to 250p.
Nervousness over the price of Brent crude led to weakness in oil shares.
Investors were also holding themselves back in readiness for France's
FFr35bn Elf Aquitaine privatisation. British Petroleum fell 3 1/2 to 366 1/2
p in spite of strong figures last week. However, BP said talk of a
persistent sell-off of the shares in the US was overdone.
Meanwhile, British Gas jumped 8 to 331p. Nomura told clients that the recent
fall in the share price had pushed the yield premium against the market to
an all-time high. Nomura remains negative but was suggesting that
underweight investors 'might consider picking up stock'.
The decline in domestic brewing stocks came to an abrupt halt as NatWest
Securities decided that the sector was looking oversold. The most recent
battering, on Monday, came after Courage reported a drop in profits.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, one of NatWest's favoured stocks, gained 7 to 522p,
and Whitbread put on 13 to 547p.
Standard Chartered rebounded 36 to 1301p after Swiss Bank pointed out that
the share price had fallen 11.4 per cent from its recent peak.
QVC Network's failed Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount in the US was said to
have inspired gains in the UK leisure market on speculation that QVC will
now look elsewhere for a multimedia target. Thorn EMI, buoyed also by good
UK industry music figures, climbed 22 to 1105p, while Rank Organisation
added 19 to 1076p. Forte put on 2 to 259p and traded a short 5m as NatWest
Securities removed the stock from its short-term sell list.
Doubts about the future of transport leasing group Tiphook surfaced after
the group said it faced liquidation if the sale of its container division
did not go ahead. The shares closed 9 down at 58p.
Profit-taking in British Steel saw the shares close 3 lighter at 142 1/2 p,
amid fears of a steep fine being imposed on the group by the European
Commission. Volume was 14m.
Speculative buying in Babcock International brought turnover of 13m as the
shares improved 2 1/4 to 38 1/4 p.
Wellcome was heavily traded with a block of 6.2m shares taken on at 639p and
placed at 640p. Dealers said SG Warburg had carried out the business which
represented a stake of just under 0.7 per cent. Wellcome's share price rose
5 to 655p.
First-quarter figures from Hanson came in at the low end of expectations,
but did no more than hold the share price down to 283 1/2 p, unchanged on
the day. Turnover hit 13m. NatWest Securities maintained a full year
forecast of Pounds 1bn after adjusting for the flotation of Hanson's US
housebuilding business.
Property minnow Jermyn Investment surged 102 to 285p amid reports of
directors' share dealings.

FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll pulls up retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retail shares performed strongly as the Argyll trading statement
prompted some in the market to forecast that the beleaguered sector was
beginning to turn the corner.
Argyll, which operates the Safeway supermarket chain, said profits would be
slightly lower than last year but the group underpinned positive sentiment
on margins by promising an increased dividend.
While gross margins had slipped as the group responded to price competition,
Argyll said some recovery had been seen recently. More positive analysts
took heart from recent similar messages from Tesco and J Sainsbury. One
said: 'If margins are stabilising, it nails the bear argument. The sector's
reached a turning point today.' And Mr Neil Curry at SG Warburg said: 'If
people are looking to reinvest in a bombed out sector, now is the right
time.'
Other analysts remain cautious, pointing out that few of the arguments that
caused the sector's collapse - among them, competition from discounters,
supermarket price wars and saturation of the market - have been properly
addressed.
Yesterday, Argyll's initial rise was clawed back as James Capel was said to
have had a line of 2m shares overhanging the market. The shares closed 5
down at 256p with 12m traded. Tesco gained 3 to 229p and Sainsbury 8 to
377p. Kwik Save added 17 to 590p and Iceland 4 to 170p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The covering of short positions as a more positive mood about the market
outlook returned brought a turnaround in stock index futures, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Brushing aside a further overnight retreat in Tokyo, the March contract on
the FT-SE 100 opened firmly at 3,359. But for a brief retreat following the
release of lower-than-expected industrial output figures, March moved
steadily ahead for the session with a more bullish tone about the market.
This helped it trade at a premium to fair value for most of the session.
With the firm start to trading in New York offering further support, March
finished at 3,390, up 36 on its previous close, but around 5 points below
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about minus 5. Turnover was
10,976 at the official close.
Dealers reported a poor day in the traded options with volume falling to
35,977 contracts of which 16,468 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and
5,363 in the Euro FT-SE 100.
In the stock options, Trafalgar House was the most active with a total of
3,109 lots with James Capel said to have carried out the days' biggest
trade, the April 115 Calls, the busiest series.
Dealings on the OMLX, trading the FT-SE mid-250 futures, was more or less at
a standstill with a mere 68 contracts traded during the session. It finished
at 4,028.5.

FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as dollar holds,
bonds improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks posted solid gains yesterday as stability returned to the currency
markets and a firmer trend took hold in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.21 ahead at 3,928.27, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.29 better at 472.52. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped 0.07 to 474.84, but the
Nasdaq composite climbed 4.67 to 790.12.
Activity on the NYSE was brisk, with 306m shares changing hands. Advancing
issues led declines, 1,194 to 862.
Stocks advanced steadily from the opening bell, after the market shook off a
scare the previous afternoon when the dollar fell sharply against the yen.
With the US currency recovering somewhat in the foreign exchange markets,
equity investors were able to put aside the disconcerting trade friction
between the US and Japan and concentrate on some strong, though
unsurprising, data on the economy.
The Federal Reserve said that January industrial production had risen 0.5
per cent, against a revised 0.9 per cent gain in December. The reading,
which was favourable in spite of weather-related setbacks, suggested that
the economy would grow at a better-than-expected 3 to 4 per cent rate in the
first quarter, according to James Capel Economics.
The US Treasury market, meanwhile, held steady as traders awaited further
developments on relations between Washington and Tokyo, and the release of
housing and consumer price data later in the week. Afternoon remarks by Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, suggested no change in the US
position on access to Japanese markets.
With calmness prevailing, many blue-chip stocks showed moderate gains, and a
few of them spurted ahead. Caterpillar was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 107
3/8 , 3M added Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 108 3/8 , Goodyear put on Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 47 1/2 and McDonald's Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 1/4 .
The long-running Paramount takeover saga appeared to have reached its
conclusion, with the company announcing that more than 50.1 per cent of its
shares had been tendered to Viacom. The company's victory brought a further
Dollars 1 7/8 decline in the value of its B stock, which was trading at
Dollars 28. QVC's share price climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 50 1/4 .
Paramount was up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 76 1/8 .
Blockbuster, which has agreed to merge with Viacom as part of the latter's
Paramount strategy, was unchanged at Dollars 24 7/8 , while BellSouth, an
ally of QVC, gained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 .
In the forest products sector, Boise Cascade jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
27 1/8 after announcing plans to reorganise its Canadian operations.
Rockefeller Center Properties appeared on the most active list for the
second day running. The stock shed a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 5 7/8 ,
after a Dollars 1 3/8 plunge the previous session, on reports that the owner
of the Manhattan landmark was having difficulty making interest payments.
Canada
Stock prices closed broadly mixed in moderate trading. According to
preliminary data, the TSE-300 index rose 19.24 points, or 0.44 per cent, to
close at 4,414.44. Volume was 76.139m shares, up from 64.847m shares on
Monday, and trading value rose to CDollars 933.8m from CDollars 930.3m.

FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei tumbles 2.5% on
further strengthening of yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A further strengthening of the yen pushed the Nikkei 225 average below the
19,000 level for the first time since January 28, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 plunged 484.65, or 2.5 per cent to 18,974.60, while the Topix
index of all first section stocks fell 26.64 to 1,555.34, and the Nikkei 300
by 4.71, or 1.6 per cent, to 287.70.
Reports that the US could impose sanctions on Japanese exports, because of
Japan's tariffs on mobile telephones, triggered further fears of a higher
yen. Comments in New York on Monday by Ms Laura Tyson, chairman of the US
council of economic advisers, indicating a tolerant stance towards the
dollar's decline, also gave a further incentive for traders to sell the US
currency against the yen.
Concerns that the yen's rise would hurt the profitability of the country's
exporters, wiping out the effects of the last economic stimulus package,
also undermined investor confidence. The 225 index, which opened at the
day's high of 19,406.44, fell to a low of 18,768.98 in the morning session
on mounting expectations that the yen could rise above the Y100 level
against the dollar. The Japanese currency closed at Y102.02 in Tokyo,
closing down Y3.67 from Monday.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed up 2.23 at 1,290.54.
Foreigners placed small lot buy orders, but domestic individuals and
arbitrageurs continued to liquidate holdings, triggering a further unwinding
of arbitrage positions. Volume was 380m shares against Monday's 290m.
Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,028 to 84 with 61 issues unchanged.
Export-related shares fell steeply. Sony lost Y180 to Y5,870 and Matsushita
Electric Industrial declined Y50 to Y1,650. Multimedia-related shares, which
had firmed recently, lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone shed Y31,000 to Y895,000, falling below Y900,000 for the first
time since January 28. Fujitsu lost Y22 to Y978 and NEC retreated Y35 to
Y985.
Car manufacturers were also lower, with Toyota Motor falling Y20 to Y1,890
and Honda Motor declining Y90 to Y1,540.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 465.16 to 21,025.81 in volume of 55m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y150 to Y6,400.
Roundup
Volume remained low in many of the region's markets yesterday, with some
foreign buyers noticeably absent.
HONG KONG made good intra-day losses to close above the 11,000 level, having
fallen nearly 200 points in the afternoon session. The Hang Seng index
closed up 23.52 at 11,012.33 in turnover down to HKDollars 5.7bn from
Monday's HKDollars 6.7bn.
Traders described the rise as technically driven since activity remained low
with many investors still on holiday.
HSBC Holdings was the most active issue, closing unchanged at HKDollars 117
after earlier dropping to HKDollars 114.
Cheung Kong, the property group, added 50 cents to HKDollars 45.50, HK
Telecom put on 10 cents to HKDollars 15 and Jardine Matheson HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 75.50.
SINGAPORE remained subdued and the Straits Times Industrials index lost
12.45 to 2,329.53. Brokers said that the budget announcement, due next week,
would have to offer better-than-expected incentives to boost market
sentiment.
KUALA LUMPUR was slightly weaker but recovered from session lows on late
bargain hunting. The composite index lost 6.09 to 1,087.21.
Public Bank rose 14 cents to MDollars 5.10 on higher 1993 earnings.
TAIWAN remained weak in the financial sector but was supported by strength
in plastics and electronics. The weighted index fell 30.25 to 5,985.01 in
turnover down to TDollars 50.5bn from TDollars 58.9bn.
Formosa Plastics, up 50 cents at TDollars 53.50, was supported by news that
it planned to develop land near Taipei into a high-technology industrial
zone.
MANILA was lifted by foreign interest in Philippine National Bank, whose
shares leapt 45 pesos or 7 per cent to 675 pesos. The composite index rose
3.81 to 3,012.55 as turnover fell to 1.3bn pesos from Monday's 1.5bn.
AUSTRALIA found support late in the session and the All Ordinaries index
ended off 4.6 at 2,234.0, recovering from a 14 point fall in early trade.
ANZ, which gained 16 cents on Monday, retreated 5 cents to ADollars 5.63 in
volume of 4.2m shares. Resource stocks remained weak with Western Mining
down 8 cents at ADollars 7.42.
KARACHI was driven higher by foreign interest on the first day of the new
account. The KSE-100 index put on 44.15 to 2,422.99.
BANGKOK's SET index recovered half its early losses to finish down 8.23 at
1,413.97, but turnover was slim at Bt7.2bn after Monday's Bt7bn. The index
had dropped to 1,406.66 in afternoon trading.
Bangkok Bank attracted attention, climbing Bt4 to Bt195, while the
newly-listed Eastern Star Real Estate closed at Bt38.00, up from its public
offer price of Bt27.
COLOMBO gathered pace for the third straight session in record turnover of
SLRs421m. The CSE all-share index gained 33.81 to 1,264.82 with volume also
up to a provisional 6.1m shares from Monday's 3.5m.
BOMBAY was slightly lower with retail investors buying selectively in thin
trading. The BSE-30 index lost 8.07 to a provisional 3,903.62.

FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: European turnover peaks in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It might have been time for equity investors to pull their horns in, after
an extremely profitable 1993. In fact, January saw European bourse turnover
go from strength to strength.
The numbers showed vigorous growth for the second month in succession, up
15.3 per cent over December for the eight markets monitored by NatWest
Securities, after gains of 12.2 per cent in December and 2.9 per cent in
November.
Aggregate turnover hit a record high for the period since NatWest started
compiling the figures in the late 1980s. Mr James Cornish, European market
strategist with the brokers, notes that the January growth accompanied a 3.8
per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries Europe index in January, as markets
prolonged their year-end rally on hopes of a further cut in German interest
rates.
International investment activity climbed again after an apparent decline in
December: volume in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London
rose 16.4 per cent in January after a 2 per cent fall the month before.
There had been a flood of domestic liquidity in December, and the US
concentration on Far Eastern and other emerging markets in the fourth
quarter of last year. In addition, says Mr Cornish, French investors had a
direct tax incentive to invest in their own market before the end of last
year, and German investors were on a deadline, too, if they wanted to avoid
fiscal punishment for bringing their money back from Luxembourg.
The market which probably believed least in the prospect of a Bundesbank
interest rate cut in January was Germany itself, where equities fell by 1.8
per cent and turnover showed the smallest rise of the month, up 3.9 per
cent.
Elsewhere, there were sizeable advances, with the Netherlands in the lead,
up 37.8 per cent on the month. Mr Cornish says that a number of individual
stories gave volume an extra lift: in the Nedlloyd shipping group, on share
price considerations; and in Hoogovens, on aluminium price prospects.
The Netherlands, too, reflected directly the return of international
investors. There was some large-scale dealing in London, says NatWest, but
Seaq international volume fell as a proportion of the domestic market,
suggesting considerable activity by US institutions dealing directly in
Amsterdam.
The other top countries included Italy, up 30.3 per cent in turnover terms
and 49.9 per cent ahead of the average of the previous three months, as the
Milan market pushed up by 6.9 per cent and confidence rose in the political
situation.
Switzerland registered an 8 per cent gain in share prices and turnover up
26.8 per cent. This may have been a surprise for the strategists. The Swiss
stock market has had three excellent years, and even its fans thought the
time for some extended profit-taking had arrived at the beginning of 1994.
As it happens, this was delayed until the first full week of February, last
week, when the Swiss market led Europe down with a loss of 5.7 per cent,
only Italy standing out against the general downtrend in share prices. This,
it seems, has finally reflected itself in bourse activity. 'Volumes,' says
Mr Cornish, 'have been falling so far in February as the going gets
tougher.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover, break a
four-day downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street, a carnival atmosphere in Germany and technical recoveries in
Sweden and Switzerland helped bourses break a four-day downtrend yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT celebrated carnival with an afternoon upsurge. A tepid session saw
the Dax index ease 0.39 to 2,115.62, up 13.69 from the previous afternoon's
Ibis-indicated close; but then share prices followed the futures market and
ended at 2,130.71, 28.78 or 1.4 per cent higher over 24 hours.
Turnover, affected by the holiday, moved up from DM5.1bn to DM6.7bn. There
was talk of interest rate hopes after lunch, although most professionals
expected nothing from the Bundesbank earlier this week and in Washington Mr
Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said that he did not expect
an interest rate cut in the near future.
The Dax future moved faster still, closing 45.5 higher at 2,146.5. Mr John
Blackley of James Capel said that the day's moves almost defied logic,
especially given that the bund future, which drove the equity market last
week, was down by 25 basis points and there was concern over the prospect of
more metalworkers' strikes tomorrow.
Short covering lifted BMW, blue-chip star of the day at DM827, up DM10.50
and rising another DM2 in the aftermarket. Generally, dealers saw the
prospect of added volatility later in the week with stock options, and
options on the Dax future expiring on Friday.
PARIS speculated on which direction to move before deciding on an upward
course and the CAC-40 index closed up a modest 14.81 to 2,257.97, after a
session high of 2,264 and a low of 2,229. Turnover, at FFr5.4bn, was
slightly stronger than on Monday.
A high proportion of the day's turnover was seen in Elf Aquitaine, the
shares adding FFr9 to FFr424 after the government announced the
institutional offer price: at FFr403, it was slightly lower than expected,
while the tranche size has been scaled down by some 20 per cent. The
allocation of shares for private investors was scaled down, the government
also announced yesterday.
Canal Plus gained FFr7 to FFr1,039 on news that the chairman and founder of
the pay television network, Mr Andre Rousselet, had resigned. This followed
last week's news in which Havas, the leisure group, raised its shareholding
in Canal Plus, forcing the resignation of Mr Rousselet from its board. Havas
slipped FFr1.20 to FFr465.70.
AMSTERDAM managed a modest advance, helped by a positive rise in Elsevier,
up Fl 2.70 to Fl 185.50 after a German bank raised its recommendation.
The AEX index put on 1.12 to 429.90. Fokker, down Fl 1.40 at Fl 21.50,
continued to attract sellers following its announcement on Monday of job
cuts while KLM, the airline, was depressed by news that the government might
restrict its participation in the planned Fl 1bn global share offering to
some Fl 300m, less than had been expected. The shares drifted down 60 cents
to Fl 51.80.
ZURICH saw short covering, and futures-related trading as investors reacted
to a 6.4 per cent fall in the blue-chip, SMI index since the beginning of
February.
The SMI rose 43.2 to 2,990.3 with Roche and Nestle in the lead, Roche
certificates rising SFr165 to SFr6,990 as the most active stock of the day
and Nestle following with a gain of SFr19 at SFr1,325.
Banks saw respectable gains and insurers did better, with Zurich Insurance
up SFr30 at SFr1,490, Winterthur another SFr15 higher at SFr1,490, and Swiss
Re SFr15 to the good at SFr695. Gains lower down the size scale were more
moderate, with the all-share, SPI index rising 21.62 to 1,902.91.
MILAN reflected a generally lower tone with Monday's strong performers,
Gemina, Generali and BCI, continuing to rise against the trend. Suggestions
that the first two companies might gain from the forthcoming privatisation
of BCI helped their prices, which closed respectively L29 and L766 higher at
L1,590 and L41,490. BCI put on L56 at L5,670.
The Mibtel index fell 60 to 10,732.
Elsewhere, Fiat declined L83 to L4,708 on the expected resumption of talks
between management and unions over job cuts. Sip, the domestic telephone
operator, lost L33.70 to L724, in line with the market, in spite of
forecasting better than expected 1993 results.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by index heavyweights, and a 2.8 per cent gain in banks
and insurance as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 18.0 to 1,534.2 in
high turnover of SKr2.49bn. Astra A put on SKr6 at SKr178, and Volvo SKr12
at SKr669.
WARSAW moved into record territory as some confidence returned to the market
following sharp declines last month. The WIG index rose 739.4 or 4.1 per
cent to 18,799.3 in turnover of 3,300bn zlotys.
ISTANBUL matched Monday's rate of recovery, the composite index putting on
another 8.9 per cent to close at a provisional 16,433.49, up 1,337.46 on the
central bank's aggressive defence of the lira against the dollar.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Yen pauses for breath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday fell against leading currencies, but traded above its
Monday low against the yen, writes Philip Gawith.
Panic selling in New York on Monday drove the dollar down to Y101 at one
point, but trading was calmer yesterday with the US currency closing in
London at Y103.1, one yen lower than Monday's close.
The dollar has fallen by about six per cent since President Clinton and Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa last week failed to agree steps on how to curb Japan's
large trade surplus with the US.
Traders said the market had paused to assess how the US administration
planned to respond to the breakdown of the talks. The US administration has
in the past used a stronger yen to curb the deficit, since it makes Japanese
exports more expensive.
In Europe, meanwhile, sterling weakened after the release of lower than
expected industrial output figures. The D-Mark was stronger against most EMS
currencies with the market anticipating no easing of policy at Thursday's
Bundesbank council meeting.
Observers were split yesterday on the short-term outlook for the yen.
Although there is widespread agreement that economic fundamentals favour a
stronger dollar, some argue that the market implications of this have been
misjudged.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, says the
weakness of the Japanese economy has encouraged capital repatriation which
has put upward pressure on the yen. He said the failure of the trade talks
was merely a trigger for investment funds to liquidate dollar holdings
bought in anticipation of a recovery in the US currency.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the market had got
itself into a difficult position by assuming 'more of the same' and driving
the yen significantly higher. The problem is that Y100.3 is the level at
which the US Federal Reserve last intervened to support the dollar when it
was weak last August.
Mr Cocker said the market now appeared to be waiting to see what sort of
punitive measures the US implements, before seeing whether it can push the
yen higher. Intervention by the Bank of Japan and profit-taking also reduced
the momentum of yen appreciation. Market reports suggest the BOJ may have
spent as much as Dollars 1bn trying to prop up the dollar.
A statement from the US Treasury that the Clinton administration was not
trying to talk up the yen also helped, although some in the market
questioned its credibility.
Mr Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase Manhattan, argues that
'it is hard to foresee any action from the US that will help prevent yen
strengthening until there are some trade concessions forthcoming, or until
the yen has reached a level where further declines would clearly be damaging
for the US economy.'
The dollar dropped across the board as its weakness against the yen flowed
across to other currencies. It finished in London nearly two pfennigs lower
at DM1.7255 from DM1.7438.
The strength of the D-Mark was assisted by comments made in Washington by Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, German Minister of Economics, who said he did not expect
German interest rates to decline 'in the next few days or weeks'. This lent
support to the market view that the Bundesbank council will not cut interest
rates at its council meeting on Thursday.
The central bank is considered unlikely to ease policy while a strike threat
over wage settlements looms in the key engineering sector.
The Bundesbank's February monthly report, due for release this morning,
should give an indication of what can be expected on Thursday.
The D-Mark was also firmer against most European currencies, trading near
the top of its trading range against the French franc, sterling and the
Italian lira.
Economic data suggesting the UK economic recovery may be less robust than
previously thought undermined sterling which closed in London at DM2.5463,
down from DM2.5622 on Monday. The poor figures gave rise to renewed
speculation that the government may again ease monetary policy. Interest
rates were cut by 25 basis points last week.
UK industrial production figures showed a 0.6 per cent fall in December
after a revised 0.2 per cent rise in November. Manufacturing output in the
same month fell 0.5 per cent.
Earlier the Confederation of British Industry said in its monthly survey for
January that UK retail sales growth remains patchy, with the outlook for
modest growth only. The rate of growth in sales was the slowest for 12
months.
Sterling did not really join in the rally against the dollar. After trading
as high as Dollars 1.4830, it fell after the release of the output numbers
to close in London at Dollars 1.4757 against the weak dollar, only slightly
higher than Monday's close of Dollars 1.4693.
The way forward for sterling will be determined today by the release of key
data, particularly January's retail sales and the retail prices index.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.605bn of
assistance. This compared with a forecast of a liquidity shortage of Pounds
1.6bn, revised down from an earlier forecast of Pounds 1.7bn.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Public opinion must be final
arbiter on biotechnology'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revolutions in biology could be central to future wealth creation in
farming, a leading agricultural scientist said yesterday. But Prof Tom
Blundell, director-general of the UK government-funded Agricultural and Food
Research Council, warned they would succeed only if backed by public opinion
and by a shift in farmers' thinking.
'The new technologies can improve the quality of food, decrease the use of
agrochemicals and assist diversification into other products such as fibres,
specialist chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuels,' he said in the fourth
annual lecture to the Royal Agricultural Society of England.
Introduction of genes from wild plants into commercial crops to provide
resistance to pests and diseases would probably be acceptable. But genetic
engineering of livestock would be resisted.
'It is clearly the responsibility of the scientist to keep the public
informed,' he said. 'Ultimately it must be the public that makes decisions
about the use of biotechnology and evaluates its social, legal and economic
repercussions.'
However, there might be occasions when introduction of new genes into farm
animals should be considered acceptable. 'This approach can provide very
valuable models for human disease and may assist the use of animal -
probably pig - organs as replacements for human organs such as heart or
kidneys.'
Prof Blundell said too much emphasis had been placed on food production,
rather than efficiency, quality, market demands and diversification.
Although farmers were beginning to respond more directly to the needs of
supermarkets, the development of non-food crops would mean they would also
have to 'interact with chemicals, construction and energy industries'.
Prof Blundell criticised 'further savage cuts' in Ministry of Agriculture
funding, which he said 'undermine the most forward-looking of agricultural
engineering research'.
He also said the economics of non-food crops had been misjudged. 'Any new
product has substitution costs associated with introduction of new
industrial plant, which in most cases is oriented towards fossil-fuel
products.'
'There is also a tendency to look at opportunities for large-scale
production, such as paper and textiles, rather than high value-added
specialist products such as chemical intermediates in cosmetics, plastics or
pharmaceuticals.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum and palladium hit
six-month highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investment funds turned their attention to platinum and palladium
yesterday, pushing their prices to the highest levels for six months.
The potential for turmoil during April's elections in South Africa, the
biggest producer of platinum and the second-largest of palladium, was cited
by traders as one reason for the funds' interest. Traders also suggested the
strength of the yen against the US dollar encouraged speculative Japanese
buying.
The platinum price was 'fixed' in London at Dollars 400.50 a troy ounce, up
Dollars 6.75, while palladium's was up Dollars 2 at Dollars 135.50.
Mr Michael Steel, market research director for Johnson Matthey, the world's
biggest platinum marketing group, pointed out that the South African mines
were a long way from potential trouble spots and said JM did not expect any
major disruption.
There had been no change in the fundamental situation: demand from carmakers
for both metals (used in anti-pollution catalysts) was weak and industrial
demand was poor. JM still believed platinum had been in surplus by 190,000
ounces last year. Palladium had been expected to show a 100,000-ounce
deficit but Russia, the biggest producer, had sold heavily at the end of
1993.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India favours sugar imports
while awaiting crop revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian food and commerce ministries have reacted favourably to a sugar
industry call for the import of 500,000 tonnes of raw sugar in the current
season (October-September). According to industry officials, the imports can
be matched by forward sales from the bumper sugar crop expected next season;
while refining the raws for local consumption will utilise the Indian mills'
considerable idled capacity.
Earlier, the federal government had allowed the import of raw sugar by the
Indian Sugar and General Industry Export Import Corporation, the industry's
trading arm, so that it could maintain exports to neighbouring countries.
The government intends that sugar exports should become a permanent feature
of India's foreign trade.
The need to import sugar for domestic consumption has been highlighted by
the reduction of the current season's production estimate from 11m tonnes to
10.8m. Moreover, the government, in its eagerness to keep the open market
sugar prices in check, has started making liberal monthly releases of the
commodity. According to the Indian Sugar Mills Association, it should be
possible to import raw sugar from Thailand, though the prices will be high.
This is the second year in a row that India has suffered a major setback in
sugar production. Last year, the production declined to 10.6m tonnes from
13.4m in 1991-92. According to industry officials, a combination of factors,
including a 3.5 per cent decline in land under cane cultivation is
responsible for this season's shortfall.
'The farmers were not keen to grow cane as last year, the majority of sugar
factories were taking too long a time to clear the cane bills,' explains Mr
OM Dhanuka, spokesman for Isma. 'At one point the industry's payment backlog
on the cane account was around Rs5bn (Pounds 108m).'
To make matters worse for the sugar factories, when the overall supply of
raw material is not comfortable, gur and jaggery manufacturers are reported
to indulge in 'large scale poaching into cane grown in the captive fields of
sugar mills'. In a normal year, the gur and jaggery units use about 36 per
cent of the cane production.
The industry officials are quite hopeful, however, about the prospects for
next season. As cane growing states have on an average raised the minimum
cane price by Rs10 a quintal (100lb) for the 1993-94 season and the sugar
mills are clearing the cane bills on time the growers' interest in the crop
has revived. 'Both the autumn and spring cane plantations are highly
encouraging. We are expecting a 20 per cent increase in cane production
during 1994-95,' says Mr Dhanuka.
The 1994-95 season will open with low stocks of about 2m tonnes of sugar,
against 3.22m tonnes for 1993-94. But this should not create a supply
problem as most Indian sugar factories should be able to start crushing in
October itself because of the expected improvement in raw material
availability. And it is confidently expected that the federal government
will offer a package of incentives including excise relief and the granting
of a higher percentage of sugar for open market sales to the mills, which
will start production early.
The industry expects that sugar production next year may top 1991-92's
record of 13.4m tonnes.

A Russian official's assurance that his country could meet its target of
300,000 tonnes of annual output cuts by end-April rallied the ALUMINIUM
market yesterday and that helped to cushion falls in other base metals.
The three-months delivery aluminium price, which had earlier dipped to
Dollars 1,230 a tonne, closed at Dollars 1,252.50, up Dollars 2 on balance.
Three-months COPPER rallied from a low of Dollars 1,829 a tonne to close at
Dollars 1,844.50, down Dollars 6.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consumers divide and rule in
the iron ore market - Bob Jones reports on the outcome of one of the
toughest-ever price-setting seasons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world iron ore industry emerged last week from one of the toughest price
settlement seasons it had ever encountered. The February 8 agreements
between Australia's Hamersley Iron, a subsidiary of the CRA group, and its
Japanese and British customers broke three months of deadlock, but reaction
among Hamersley's rival suppliers has been hostile.
In the most important settlement, covering 1994-95 Japanese deliveries,
Hamersley reluctantly accepted price drops of 9.5 per cent for the standard
fines grade and 5.9 per cent for its higher quality lump ore. In return the
Japanese steel mills agreed to take an unchanged volume of 18m tons, despite
their stated need to reduce next fiscal year intake overall by 16 per cent.
Four Australian and Brazilian miners followed the Hamersley lead in Japan
and agreed similar price reductions, but other suppliers have condemned the
deal. Recent price negotiations have seen a pattern established in which a
single supplier agrees a seemingly unfavourable price in return for volume.
All other suppliers are penalised because consumers tend to use up all their
bonus allocations in the first settlement.
The miners have been arguing that demand is now stronger than this time last
year, and their delivery figures bear this out. Only two miners recorded a
decline in deliveries in 1993.
The steel mills' divide-and-rule tactics this year derive from the huge
losses they are making in the miners' two major markets, Europe and Japan.
Japanese steel losses could total Y240bn (Pounds 1.57bn) in this fiscal
year. Germany's largest steelmaker Thyssen Stahl alone lost DM1.2bn (Pounds
460m) in 1992-93. European Union efforts to reduce steel industry capacity
are encountering huge resistance from private sector mills, which accuse
Brussels of subsidising state-owned industries in Italy Spain and Germany.
So the miners have been forced to accept that, as iron ore is at least 95
per cent dependent on the steel industry for sales, the ability of the mills
to pay is paramount. They are bitterly upset that the usual supply and
demand arguments have been jettisoned this year. In reply the Japanese mills
have argued that there are 20m tonnes of over-capacity in the iron ore
industry and that shipment problems are merely logistical.
There is usually a time lag between improvements in steel and iron ore
prices. Hamersley's sales and marketing director, Mr Roddy Kinkead-Weekes,
stated after the Japanese agreement that 'the underlying demand for steel
and hence for iron ore has firmed and will improve further as the world
economy improves'. If history is any guide, booming steel output in North
America should presage strong recovery in Europe. But European improvement
has been too slow and too late to help miners.
Even the argument of increased Chinese demand has left the mills unmoved.
During the last decade Beijing has become firmly of the opinion that it is
better to import iron ore to make the finished product. Chinese imports have
risen from 14.3m tonnes in 1990 to an estimated 28m-30m last year. Further
growth can been expected in the next few years, provided China resolves
problems at its ports.
Not all is gloom. The higher quality pellet and lump grades have seen demand
turn round. In Europe and Japan the new lump premium is 8.7 per cent higher.
Pellet demand is rising fast: one small producer in Norway saw shipments
rise by almost half last year.
But pellet prices are likely to fall all the same. Of the two basic types,
blast furnace material is suffering from a market in long term decline as
the scrap-based mini-mill becomes ever more popular. The only hope of a
roll-over of prices is the direct reduction market, whose customers are
mini-mills. Expansion of pelletising capacity is under way in India and
Sweden and under consideration in Australia and the Middle East. For LKAB of
Sweden, saddled with the investment burden of a new 4m-tonne pellet plant to
open next year, this year's settlement has been a particular blow.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barbadian sugar industry to be
restructured
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ailing Barbadian industry, now being managed by Booker Tate of the UK,
is to be restructured to allow it to meet export quota obligations in the
European Union and the US, writes Canute James in Kingston, Jamaica.
Production of 54,000 tonnes last year was the lowest in 40 years and forced
the government to import sugar for the domestic market while trying to
fulfil its quotas from local production.
The industry, which is heavily indebted to a government-owned bank, is
receiving Dollars 11.5m in new loans from the Caribbean Development Bank to
help the restructuring, which will include the establishment of a new
company to oversee all aspects of the industry.
The intention is to lift production to 75,000 tonnes a year in five years,
says Mr David Bowen, the island's agriculture minister. This will allow
Barbados to meet its European and US quotas, and domestic demand.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Investors go for safety first in volatile
environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds had another volatile day, with the higher-yielding
markets posting the largest losses and the core markets benefiting from
their perceived status as safe havens amid widespread nervousness.
'In this volatile environment, investors opt for safety-plays in the core
markets,' said Mr Andre de Silva, a market strategist at Paine Webber in
London, noting that the yield premiums on Italian, Spanish and Swedish bonds
over German bunds have widened significantly over the past two weeks.
In the UK, gilts ended a choppy session slightly lower despite encouraging
economic data. Gilt futures hit the day's high after the release of much
weaker-than-expected December manufacturing output and industrial production
figures, but drifted lower as follow-through cash buying failed to
materialise.
The announcement of the terms for next week's gilt auction had little impact
on the market, although traders were cheered by the size of the auction,
which was at the low end of market expectations.
Otherwise, the details were in line with forecasts: the Bank will auction
Pounds 2.5bn of the existing 7 per cent gilt due 2001 next Wednesday. The
issue will be partly paid, with 50 per cent payable on April 11, and is Free
of Tax to Residents Abroad (Fotra). When-issued trading began yesterday.
Gilt traders today will focus on the announcement of the January retail
prices index and retail sales data.
German bunds saw another trendless day amid thin volume as parts of Germany
were closed for a holiday. The bund future fell on comments from Mr Gunther
Rexrodt, the German economics minister, who said that he did not expect
German interest rates to decline in the near term.
Although the D-Mark firmed against the dollar and some ERM currencies, few
market participants expect the Bundesbank to lower interest rates at its
council meeting on Thursday as long as the pay dispute in the engineering
sector continues.
Italian and Spanish bonds continued to slide as investors shifted into
lower-yielding core markets. The Italian futures contract on Liffe dropped
by 0.97 point to 116.27, pressured by the 10-year bond auction, where the
yield rose to 7.59 per cent from 7.36 per cent at the previous auction in
January.
The Madrid-based Spanish bond future fell by 0/70 point to 104.98. Prices
remain pressured by recent bearish inflation indicators and selling by
overseas investors.
Supported by the weak stock market and the strong yen, Japanese government
bonds continued their recent rally but late profit-taking erased most gains,
leaving them only slightly firmer at the close.
Nevertheless, Mr Mark Hale, senior economist at Sakura Finance, expects the
yield on the JGB No. 157 to ease to 3.20 per cent to 3.25 per cent in the
near term, from 3.385 per cent currently, aided by the strong currency, more
evidence of the economy's weakness and an accommodating money-market stance
by the Bank of Japan ahead of year-end on March 31.
US Treasury bonds held steady yesterday as the dollar stabilised against the
yen and two readings on the economy produced no surprises.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 97
11/32 , with the yield at 6.448 per cent. On the short end, the two-year
note also showed no change at 99 7/32 , to yield 4.403 per cent.
Bonds across the maturity range held close to their opening levels despite
underlying concern over trade relations between the US and Japan. The long
end had slumped in the previous session after tensions between the two
triggered a downturn in the value of the dollar against the yen.
But the US currency firmed yesterday, easing fears the Japanese investors
would sell off their dollar-denominated holdings. The longer-dated
securities drifted higher, but eased later in the afternoon.
The day's economic news was largely in line with expectations. The Federal
Reserve reported January industrial production up 0.5 per cent, against a
revised 0.9 per cent in December.
Capacity utilisation, which is keenly watched as a measure of inflationary
potential, edged up to 83.1 per cent, from 82.9 per cent the previous month.
Neither set of data was conclusive enough to influence sentiment.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: World Bank facility enhances
liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank is seeking to increase investor confidence in its structured
bonds by incorporating facilities in its forthcoming Dollars 5bn global
multi-currency note programme to improve the liquidity and price
transparency in the bonds in the secondary market.
The World Bank plans to raise at least Dollars 2bn of its annual borrowing
programme of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn through structured
products. These products will be linked only to interest rates and exchange
rates.
Although structured bonds tend to have relatively short maturities, the
World Bank hopes that its liquidity facility will enable it to achieve
maturities of between four and 10 years. Mr Sudhir Krishnamurthi, senior
financial officer at the World Bank, said the liquidity arrangements were
designed to reduce concerns expressed by investors.
By offering to exchange its outstanding structured notes for new
floating-rate or structured notes, the World Bank hopes to be more
supportive of its sponsoring dealers' secondary market activities than other
issuers.
Mr Krishnamurthi said the World Bank's strong internal standards regarding
the use of derivatives should also appeal to investors. 'We tend to be
extremely careful to ensure that the structures make sense and have the
right risk relationships,' he said.
The multi-currency programme, which replaces the World Bank's existing
programmes, is likely to start next week and should enable the World Bank to
continue to drive down its funding costs.
The sponsoring dealers for the programme are Commerzbank, Goldman Sachs, IBJ
International, Kidder Peabody, Lehman Brothers, Mitsubishi Finance and
Morgan Stanley. However, the dealers will be reviewed on a regular basis.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Sweden raises Pounds 200m with
five-year Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Sweden took advantage of the temporary strength in the UK
government bond market yesterday afternoon to raise Pounds 200m through an
issue of Eurobonds with a five-year maturity.
The pricing of the bonds, to yield 24 basis points over the 6 per cent UK
government bond due 1999, was widely regarded as fair and reflected the
yield spread on Sweden's sterling-denominated paper in the secondary market.
Lead managers IBJ International and UBS said that most of the demand for the
issue came from Europe.
The proceeds of the deal, which remained in syndicate overnight, were
thought to have been swapped into floating-rate dollars. Some syndicate
managers noted, however, that the pricing of the bonds on its own would not
have allowed Sweden to achieve its perceived dollar funding target of around
10 to 12 basis points below Libor.
The other main deal of the day was a Dollars 300m 10-year offering of
Eurobonds from the US financial subsidiary of BMW, the German car
manufacturer, which has an implied single-A rating. The bonds, which were
priced to yield 66 basis points over 10-year US Treasuries, were deemed to
be expensive when compared with yield spreads on outstanding 10-year
dollar-denominated paper by other single-A corporates.
Lead managers Dresdner Bank and Goldman Sachs reported solid demand for the
bonds from Italy, Switzerland and France but said that German interest was
muted because of a public holiday in parts of Germany. Nevertheless, when
the bonds were freed to trade, they slipped from their fixed re-offer price
of 99.85 to 99.75 and the spread widened to 69 basis points, according to
some dealers.
Elsewhere, Region d'Ile de France, the French local authority, raised
FFr800m through an offering of eight-year Eurobonds which were priced to
yield 25 basis points over the French government bond yield curve. Lead
manager CCF said the bonds appealed to French institutions and retail
investors in Switzerland. Generale des Eaux is expected to launch a FFr2bn
offering of eight-year Eurobonds as early as today at a yield spread of
between 45 to 50 basis points over French government bonds.
The European Investment Bank was also thought to be taking bids from four
investment banks for a Dollars 500m offering of 10-year Eurobonds. The price
talk on the deal was between five and 10 basis points over the old US
treasury. Syndicate managers said the spread on the EIB's deal could
influence the pricing on the Asian Development Bank's forthcoming Dollars
750m offering of global bonds.
The market also expects the Kingdom of Belgium to raise as much as DM1bn in
the Eurobond market in the near future. The issuer is believed to favour a
10-year maturity but some syndicate managers believed that it would be able
to achieve better pricing if it opted for a maturity of between five and
seven years.

South Korea's finance ministry said it would allow domestic companies to
issue overseas equity-linked securities with no prior approval from
securities authorities, Reuter reports from Seoul.
At present, companies hoping to raise funds abroad through convertible
bonds, bonds with warrants or depository receipts are required to get
approval from the Securities Supervisory Board and the Securities Exchange
Commission. The commission is expected to scrap the obligation on February
28, although a finance ministry official said firms would still be required
to notify the ministry of their plans.
The ministry expected a total of Dollars 2.5bn of overseas bonds to be
issued by South Korean concerns overseas this year.
Issue of equity-linked securities would total between Dollars 1.2bn and
Dollars 1.3bn from Dollars 920m in 1993.
South Korean non-manufacturing firms will now be able to raise funds abroad
to expand into overseas markets or for royalty payments. Such issues were
limited to manufacturers planning overseas investment or the import of
manufacturing equipment or research facilities.

Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewing group, and its owners are set to sell
12 per cent of the company's share capital today in a two-tranche initial
public offering worth 1.65bn pesos (Dollars 533m), writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico.
The primary and secondary offers, totalling 24.3m shares, at 68 pesos per
share comprise the biggest domestic share issue of a non-financial group in
recent Mexican history. They value the whole company at 13.77bn pesos, or
38.5 times earnings and 2.3 times book value.
Modelo will become one of Mexico's most valuable companies, in terms of
market capitalisation, and its shares will trade at a premium to those of
Femsa, its main competitor.
Best known for its popular Corona beer, Modelo accounts for more than half
of Mexico's domestic beer market and two-thirds of the country's exports.
The company will sell 5 per cent of its share capital in the primary
offering, and its owners another 7 per cent in the secondary offering.
Modelo said it would use part of the proceeds from the primary share
offering to build a new brewery in the state of Zacatecas.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Assembling an entertainment
monster - Blockbuster investors hold the key to the success of the
Viacom-Paramount merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After all the fighting, was it worth it? The merger of Viacom, Paramount
Communications and - provided it goes ahead - Blockbuster Entertainment will
create a monster in the entertainment industry.
However, digesting the beast poses significant financial and management
challenges. Viacom's management, having just fought a five-month war for
control of Paramount, must now gird itself for the struggle to persuade
Blockbuster shareholders to join the group.
On paper, although the Paramount takeover involves more than Dollars 5bn of
new debt, the financial structure created by a three-way merger would be
more robust than many of the debt-financed takeovers of the 1980s.
The combined group would have total debts of around Dollars 10bn. Analysts
put the costs of paying interest and servicing preference share capital at
around Dollars 600m, although Mr Frank Biondi, Viacom chief executive, says
it will be closer to Dollars 500m-Dollars 550m after the group has
refinanced some of its existing debt.
The cashflow generated by its combined operations is variously estimated at
between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn a year - a comfortable multiple of the
group's annual debt servicing costs.
Without Blockbuster, though, this debt burden would look much more onerous.
Whatever strategic arguments were made for its inclusion, the video rental
group was brought into the merger mainly to provide an extra cushion of
financial stability.
It has only some Dollars 500m of debt, and would provide around a third of
the combined group's operating cashflow.
Blockbuster shareholders may yet reject the deal, which comes up for
approval in the second quarter of the year. They have been offered mainly
Viacom class B non-voting shares, a currency which is also being used to
finance a large part of the Paramount bid.
These shares have plummeted in recent weeks, touching Dollars 28 yesterday,
down from a high of over Dollars 60 last summer. Blockbuster has already
agreed to pay Dollars 55 each for a large block of these shares, providing
Dollars 1.25bn to back Viacom's bid for Paramount.
To ease concerns about the value of its B shares, Viacom has offered a
degree of underpinning for both the Paramount and Blockbuster bids.
Under these so-called contingent value rights, it would issue extra
securities to Paramount and Blockbuster shareholders if the B shares
remained at a depressed level.
However, the extent of the underpinning is limited in both cases. It would
also involve the issue of even more B shares, further reducing their value.
These considerations have depressed Blockbuster's own share price. If the
video rental chain's shareholders now reject the deal, it will leave the
merged Viacom/Paramount with considerably less financial flexibility to
invest in future development than Mr Redstone had planned.
The extended slide in Viacom's B shares, although exacerbated by the
prospect of more shares being issued under the contingent value rights, has
been driven mainly by a concern that Paramount will dilute Viacom's
earnings.
Both Viacom and Blockbuster have been rated high-growth companies by the
stock market, and traded at multiples of around 16 and 14 times cashflow
respectively last summer.
Paramount, by contrast, was accorded a rating of 10 times cashflow before
the bidding war started, marking a belief that it remains a company with low
growth prospects.
If the combined group trades at the same valuation level as Time Warner and
Walt Disney - the two entertainment groups to which it is most similar - it
would carry a multiple of around 11.5, according to analysts at S. G.
Warburg.
The main loser so far has been Mr Redstone. With around three-quarters of
the Viacom B shares currently in issue, he has seen the paper value of his
investments slashed in recent months.
Mr Redstone also owns some 85 per cent of Viacom's class A voting shares,
which have seen their market value tumble to Dollars 34 1/8 from Dollars 67
1/2 .
He remains under investigation by securities regulators, who are examining
purchases of Viacom shares he made before the Paramount bid was announced,
helping to raise the paper value of the offer last September.
If Viacom is to reverse the slide in its shares, it must first convince
investors that the new group will be more than the sum of its parts. Wall
Street remains sceptical about the scope for cutting costs and increasing
revenues.
According to Mr Biondi, cost cutting will come mainly from reducing
corporate overheads and combining the three companies' television and movie
production groups: Viacom Entertainment, Paramount Picture and Paramount TV,
and two film studies controlled by Blockbuster, Spelling and Republic.
Combining these operations should reduce overheads on the production side.
Also, it will make the group the biggest buyer of film rights in the
entertainment industry, at Dollars 2bn a year, and one of the biggest media
buyers - both areas where the group could use its muscle to pressure
suppliers into offering discounts, according to Mr Biondi.
In terms of growing revenues, Viacom points to three main areas.
First, it intends to grow as a producer, publisher and distributor of CD-ROM
products, mainly computer games. Second, it has targeted growth in its cable
network operations around the world - although there are only limited
prospects for growth in the US. And third, it plans to move into
merchandising, emulating the stores run by rivals Walt Disney and Warner
Brothers. Viacom hopes Blockbuster's experience in managing a large retail
network will help it in this regard.
There could also be opportunities for cross-promotion of products within the
group.
For instance, Blockbuster's chain of music retailers in the US - claimed to
be the country's largest - could benefit from Viacom's ownership of the
popular MTV music video station.
Nickelodeon, a cable-TV station popular with children, could be used to
promote Blockbuster's Discovery Zone entertainment centres.
Meanwhile, the three-way deal, if consummated, could lead to considerable
jostling for position among executives from the three companies, raising
questions about how quickly the benefits of a merger can be achieved.
Executives from Viacom, Paramount and Blockbuster would find themselves
rubbing shoulders with Nynex, the telephone company which itself backed
Viacom's Paramount bid with over Dollars 1bn.
Mr Redstone, with a majority of the voting stock, would be securely
established at the head of the group.
It is a remarkable rise: just seven years ago, at the age of 63, Mr Redstone
was launching the bid for Viacom which would first take him out of movie
theatres and into cable television.
If the second stage of his plan - to acquire Blockbuster - goes ahead, he
will end up owning over 20 per cent of the new colossus and controlling some
61 per cent of its voting shares.
But what of the others?
Mr Biondi has been pencilled in as chief executive of the group.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, the former waste management baron who built Blockbuster
into the world's biggest video rental company, would become a deputy
chairman.
Paramount executives have yet to be offered any seats around the table.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at The
Equitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US insurer The Equitable yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of
Dollars 83.9m. The result showed further recovery from heavy losses in
previous years, incurred on soured property and junk bond investments.
In the same quarter a year ago, the company, which is 49 per cent-owned by
the French insurance group Axa, reported a loss of Dollars 28.9m.
The strong final quarter took The Equitable's full-year profits to Dollars
234.5m, compared with a Dollars 128.6m loss in 1992.
The key to its recent successes has been the improvement in core insurance
business. Excluding the impact of investment gains and restructuring
charges, the insurance operations earned Dollars 116.9m last year, up from
operating earnings of Dollars 46.9m in 1992.
The company said aggressive cost-reduction, and a lowering of crediting
rates - made possible by the low interest rate environment - were the main
factors in the turnround. They helped offset higher-than-expected mortality
rates in the second half of the year.
Mr Joseph Melone, president of The Equitable's Life Assurance Society,
singled out the success of the company's targeted insurance products. During
the year, 94.5 per cent of new sales came from these lines, he said.
The Equitable's investment services operations contributed operating profits
of Dollars 235.9m during the year, thanks to record earnings at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street brokerage unit. Solid growth at its
Alliance Capital money management firm has helped.
On the investment side, the income yield on The Equitable's main general
account portfolio rose from 7.46 per cent to 7.64 per cent last year.
The increase was attributed to improved returns on property and equity
holdings, and a shift of cash and other short-term assets to longer-term
bonds offering higher yields.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Maclean Hunter rejects CDollars
2.8bn takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and broadcast group, yesterday
rejected a CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.1bn) takeover bid by Rogers
Communications. It described the bid as inadequate and an attempt to
circumvent a shareholder rights plan.
Instead, MH vowed to pursue 'all reasonable alternatives to maximise
shareholder value'.
Whether Rogers succeeds or fails, it seems likely to precipitate a heavy
restructuring of the 108-year-old Toronto-based company.
Should Rogers prevail, Mr Ted Rogers, chief executive and controlling
shareholder, has outlined plans to spin off MH's publishing interests into
its newspaper subsidiary, Toronto Sun Publishing.
The alternatives being considered by MH also entail significant changes.
They include a recapitalisation designed to put cash into shareholders'
pockets.
Mr Robert Furse, chief financial officer, said yesterday this might take the
form of a special dividend or a share buyback. Other options include selling
or spinning off all or part of its Canadian cable-TV operations, and
alliances with third parties.
MH has already put its US cable-TV franchises in Michigan, New Jersey and
Florida up for sale. These businesses contributed 70 per cent of its 1993
earnings.
Rogers, whose interests centre on cable-TV and telecommunications, has
offered CDollars 17 per MH share plus 'participation rights' in proceeds
from MH's US cable business, provided these assets realise more than
CDollars 1.5bn after expenses.
MH said yesterday the terms of these participation rights did not give
Rogers 'a significant incentive to maximise the sale proceeds for the
benefit of MH shareholders'. MH also said money from the sale could be paid
out directly to its shareholders in a more tax-efficient way.
MH reiterated that its shareholder rights plan, set up five years ago, was
not designed to prevent a takeover.
However, it said Rogers' offer 'attempts to coerce the shareholders and
board of MH to take the very action which the (plan) was intended to prevent
 -that is, accepting an inadequate bid in a short period of time and without
the ability to seek other alternatives over a reasonable time frame'.
Rogers has yet to respond. Mr Rogers insisted last week the company would
not raise its offer.

Cigna, the US insurer, reported a fall in after-tax profits last year as it
took a Dollars 244m charge to cover asbestos and environmental costs. It
also restructured its property and casualty operations.
The company said it would report after-tax losses of Dollars 60m in the
current quarter, due to the Californian earthquake, and Dollars 25m
attributable to the severe weather in the US.
However, Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive, said the restructuring on the
property and casualty side, which led to a Dollars 107m after-tax charge,
would lead to improved results in the future.
Net income for the year fell to Dollars 234m, or Dollars 3.25 a share, from
Dollars 311m, or Dollars 4.34, in 1992. In the final three months of 1993,
net income jumped to Dollars 194m from Dollars 50mm, boosted by after-tax
realised investment gains of Dollars 102m, compared with Dollars 19m in the
1992 quarter. Operating income in Cigna's life and health insurance
businesses was up 42 per cent for the year, to Dollars 464m.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: IBM in Unisys chip deal

<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to make semiconductor chips for Unisys,
its long-time rival. The chips will be used in a new generation of Unisys
mainframe computers.
IBM will manufacture the chips, designed by Unisys, at its plant in
Burlington, Vermont. It has been seeking new customers for its chip
manufacturing business to leverage its investments in semiconductor
production.
The agreement signals the completion of Unisys's switch from older bipolar
semiconductor technology to cheaper advanced complementary metal oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) chips for use in its mainframe computers. IBM is also
converting its mainframe products to CMOS.
CMOS is the standard semiconductor technology used in personal computers and
workstations. Until recently, however, it has lacked the speed and density
of the bipolar technology used in mainframe computers. CMOS is now catching
up with bipolar speeds.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mexican brewer in Dollars 533m
share issue

Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewing group, and its owners are set to sell
12 per cent of the company's share capital today in a two-tranche initial
public offering worth 1.652bn pesos (Dollars 533m).
The primary and secondary offers, totalling 24.3m shares, at 68 pesos per
share comprise the biggest domestic share issue of a non-financial group in
recent Mexican history. They value the whole company at 13.77bn pesos, or
38.5 times earnings and 2.3 times book value.
Modelo will become one of Mexico's most valuable companies, in terms of
market capitalisation, and its shares will trade at a premium to those of
Femsa, its main competitor.
Best known for its popular Corona beer, Modelo accounts for more than half
of Mexico's domestic beer market and two-thirds of the country's exports.
Last year Modelo achieved net profits of 350m pesos, cash flow of 642m
pesos, and estimated revenues of some 5bn pesos.
Anheuser-Bush, the giant US brewery, bought an 18 per cent stake in the
company last March for Dollars 477m.
The two companies said at that time that they would co-operate on marketing
and distribution. Anheuser-Busch also acquired the right to increase its
stake to 35 per cent by 1997.
Mr Jacques Levy, executive vice-president of Accival, the brokerage that
managed the issue, said that the offering of Modelo 'is a big break that
finally shows a company believes Mexico is mature enough to absorb this kind
of money'.
Mr Levy said that Modelo had no plans to make an international offering. The
company will sell 5 per cent of its share capital in the primary offering,
and its owners another 7 per cent in the secondary offering.
Modelo said that it would use part of the proceeds from the primary share
offering to build a new brewery in the state of Zacatecas.
It reckons the new brewery will be ready by 1997, and that it will
eventually produce 1.5m litres of beer annually.
