FT  15 FEB 94 / Support slips for coal power plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity generating companies in England and Wales are unlikely to
clean up more than two of their coal-fired power stations because the work
is not economic, the chief executive of National Power said yesterday.
Mr John Baker said that desulphurisation was 'yesterday's technology'. Apart
from Drax in North Yorkshire which National Power, the largest generator, is
currently cleaning up at a cost of Pounds 700m, and PowerGen's nearby
station at Ratcliffe, which is also slated for desulphurisation, coal plants
were 'withering assets', he said. By the time they had been cleaned up, they
would be more than 30 years old with little useful life left.
Coal stations were also much more vulnerable than other types of power
station to tougher environmental measures, including a carbon tax. However,
National Power was participating in research into clean coal technology
which might provide an answer as long as coal was competitively priced.
Mr Baker, who was addressing the Coal Industry Society, said that power
generated from gas cost the same as power from cleaned-up coal plants, but
was more attractive commercially because it burnt more efficiently and
produced much less carbon dioxide.
That was why environmental controls were among the strongest forces behind
the progressive reduction in coal-fired power generation, Mr Baker said.
Mr Baker forecast that coal's share of power generation would fall to only
30 per cent by the turn of the century, down from 75 per cent five years
ago, yielding mainly to growing output from gas and nuclear stations.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Spitalfields building plan given start date
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first stage of the planned redevelopment of the former Spitalfields
fruit and vegetable market, to the east of the City of London, is set to
start within a year.
Spitalfields Holdings, which owns the 13-acre site, expects to agree a deal
in the next six weeks with a developer to fund and build up to 160 homes on
part of the site.
Spitalfields Holdings is jointly owned by LET, the property developer, and
Costain and Balfour Beatty, the construction companies.
The long-awaited initial development is likely to comprise town houses and
flats at the northern end of the site. The housing will be aimed at the
upper end of the market, although much will depend on detailed planning
consent.
The decision to press ahead with the housing component of the scheme
reflects the relatively strong state of the housing market in central
London, compared with the office market. With the exception of a few schemes
in the centre of the City, there is unlikely to be demand for large-scale
development of new offices in the City for some years.
Sales of new houses in Great Britain are estimated to have risen by between
10 per cent and 15 per cent last year, excluding one-off sales to housing
associations, compared with a 5 per cent rise in sales of all types of
homes.
The outline planning consent consists of 900,000 sq ft of offices and
300,000 sq ft of residential and retail units.
The total project is planned to be developed in phases as market conditions
improve. In its latest report, Costain put the scheduled completion date for
the project at 2001. A temporary market now occupies part of the site.
The severe recession in the City office market in the early 1990s has cast
doubt on the value of the scheme. Costain's 1992 accounts wrote down the
cost of the interest capitalised on the scheme at Pounds 25.7m, putting its
book value at Pounds 45m, with a further Pounds 18m premium to be paid to
the Corporation of London over three years.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Splitting the atom fuels a privatisation: The sale of the
Atomic Energy Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to announce the Pounds 200m sale of the UK Atomic
Energy Authority later this week, heralding one of the more unusual
privatisations yet attempted.
For one thing, the authority will have to be split into two parts to
separate the sellable bits from those which will have to stay in government
hands. The radioactive sites left over from 40 years of experimentation and
development of the UK nuclear industry will remain the responsibility of the
state.
For another, the assets being sold will consist largely of the employees'
brainpower rather than plant and equipment. Valuing the business will
therefore provide a special challenge to City advisers.
Privatisation could take many forms. The company could be floated on the
stock exchange where its value would be in the order of Pounds 200m.
Alternatively it could be sold whole or in bits. However, any purchaser
would have to safeguard the independence on which AEA's reputation would
depend. There could even be a management buy-out.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, the former chief of IBM's UK subsidiary, who is now the
AEA's chairman, is keen to see the AEA move into the private sector. He
describes it as unique and capable of generating healthy profits.
The split will take place in April. One half will retain the various nuclear
installations, such as the Dido and Pluto experimental reactors at Harwell,
the company's headquarters, which are being shut down and will have to be
decommissioned. The costs of this work will be borne by the taxpayer.
The second, to be named AEA Technology, will be privatised as a consultancy
offering a wide range of expertise not only in the nuclear field, but also
in other high-tech areas of industry.
Sir Anthony sees three broad areas of operation. One is what he calls plant
optimisation: offering services to enable companies to make the best use of
production plant, and extending its life. AEA possesses technologies which
could be applied to areas such as chemicals, food and drinks processing and
pharmaceuticals.
The second area is safety assessment. Again, this could be applied not only
to nuclear plant and industry, but other areas such as transport where
demand will grow with rail privatisation.
The third is the environment. With the acquisition last year of the
government's Warren Springs environmental research laboratory, AEA plans to
create a national environmental technology centre.
At the moment, 70 per cent of AEA's turnover is related to the nuclear
industry. Sir Anthony expects to see that fall to 30 per cent over the
coming years as the non-nuclear side strengthens. About 40 per cent of its
work is government or public sector. But the private side is the fastest
growing, and its proportion will increase.
Similarly, Sir Anthony sees the AEA's foreign business growing from the
present level of 20-25 per cent. Business in Japan, for example, has doubled
in the last two years.
AEA Technology will account for about Pounds 200-Pounds 250m of the
authority's current total turnover of about Pounds 400m a year. It will also
employ 3,500 of the present 7,500 employees, though the restructuring is
likely to produce about 2,000 redundancies. Employment has already halved
since 1989, when the AEA began to be reshaped for privatisation.
A chief executive for the privatised division should be appointed in the
next couple of months. Sir Anthony says he is looking for someone with a
commercial background who can handle the technological aspects and the
international dimension to the business, and understand the needs of both
the public and private sectors.
The big difficulty, though, is valuing this business. If most of AEA's
assets are its people, it could easily lose them. But Sir Anthony believes
that the challenge of creating a new business plus the AEA's range of
technological expertise will be a powerful incentive for people to stay.
He is evasive on the issue of profitability. The AEA as a whole lost Pounds
48m last year, mainly because of Pounds 62m of exceptional costs linked to
the restructuring. The year before it made a profit of Pounds 14m. Sir
Anthony will only say that AEA Technology could make profits in double
figures.
The package offered to investors or potential buyers would have to include
clear indications of the company's contracts and its growth prospects. One
way of making it attractive would be for the government to sign large
long-term contracts to service the parts retained in the public sector. Sir
Anthony, though, is keen to keep the company in one piece. 'Our challenge is
to demonstrate the value of one entity.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / NHS told heart drugs could free up Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service could improve the efficiency of its treatment of
heart failure by almost 20 per cent - the equivalent of Pounds 50m - if it
prescribed more drugs instead of hospitalising patients, say studies
published yesterday.
The research was partly funded by Merck, the world's biggest drugs company,
but the papers were independently reviewed before publication.
It bolsters the case of the pharmaceuticals industry that government efforts
to cut the drugs bill do not save money.
In the studies, two economists and a cardiologist say that treating heart
failure costs the NHS Pounds 360m a year. Most of that arises from hospital
admissions, which could be reduced if a new class of drugs, the ACE
inhibitors, were prescribed more widely.
Merck is a large supplier of ACE inhibitors. Other companies which are big
suppliers of ACE inhibitors are Bristol Myers Squibb of the US and the UK's
Zeneca.
The report says that almost 30,000 hospitalisations could be eliminated at a
nominal saving of Pounds 51.2m. In practice, the beds would be filled by
other patients and the benefit seen in a greater number of patients treated
for a given budget.
ACE inhibitors are already one of the fastest growing groups of
pharmaceuticals. Zeneca saw annual sales of its product Zestril grow 44 per
cent (excluding currency benefits) to more than Pounds 208m in the first
half of 1993.
The reports looked at the cost benefit of the use of Merck's ACE inhibitor,
enalapril. It used data from previous trials of the effects of enalapril to
argue that there could be 50 fewer deaths and 350 fewer hospital admissions
for every 1,000 patients treated for three years.
The claims follow others from the pharmaceutical industry that government
efforts to control healthcare spending by cutting drugs budgets raised costs
elsewhere.
But Dr John McMurray, the cardiologist who contributed to the studies
published yesterday, said that it was 'naive' to assume that less money
would be spent if more ACE inhibitors were prescribed.
He said that patients would be better off, but that previous experience
with, for example, the use of ulcer drugs which replaced operations showed
that the total spent on treating ulcers did not fall.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Cold threatens further chaos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Temperatures will be very low again this morning after sub-zero temperatures
and driving winds caused chaos for travellers yesterday, forecasters warned.
The south of England was worst hit.
British Rail said that further cold weather would hamper normal services.
Trains south of the Thames into London yesterday were delayed by up to 30
minutes.
Bad weather affected the south-west, mid-Wales and the midlands, and more
snow was expected in Hampshire, Dorset, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire,
Oxfordshire, Sussex and the Isle of Wight.
More than 26,000 motorists, three times the daily average, suffered
mechanical breakdowns yesterday, motoring organisations said.
The conditions also led to a 50 per cent increase in traffic accidents, said
the RAC. In the London area alone, there were 449 incidents, 168 of them
resulting in serious injuries.
British Airways said it cancelled more than 40 short-haul flights from
Heathrow, and warned passengers to European destinations to check their
flight details.
Forecasters said there should be a thaw later today and said temperatures
should climb above freezing by the end of the week.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Councils warn of Pounds 1bn reform cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reorganising local government in rural England will create costs that could
not be repaid until 2004, the Society of County Treasurers warned yesterday.
It estimates that the costs of making the change from the present two-tier
system of counties and districts to all-purpose unitary authorities will be
about Pounds 1bn - equivalent to about Pounds 27m for each county.
Using the Local Government Commission's most optimistic estimates for annual
savings once the reorganisation has been carried out - Pounds 4.5m for each
county - this would mean that the costs would take until 2004 to repay. The
new structures are supposed to be introduced in most areas in either 1996 or
1997.
Authorities will meet transitional costs by borrowing from the government.
The society says that on the assumption that the interest rate is 6 per
cent, this would push final repayment back from the financial year 2002-03
to 2004-05. But if savings were only Pounds 2m per county area, repayment
would be delayed from 2010-11 until about 2020.
The treasurers also predict serious problems in Somerset, where all the
county's Conservative MPs oppose plans for reorganisation. Sir John Banham,
chairman of the commission, has proposed that the county should be split
into three unitary authorities, with the long-term financial impact being
anything from an annual saving of Pounds 3m to annual costs of Pounds 2m.
Mr David Nicholson, the Conservative MP for Taunton who is one of the most
vehement opponents, said: 'This is yet further evidence that this whole
upheaval in local government will cost council taxpayers more.'
Assuming that savings are in the middle of this range at Pounds 1m a year,
the treasurers say the cost of interest payments on loans to pay for the
transitional costs would exceed the savings.
The Association of District Councils, which strongly supports the creation
of unitary authorities, said that savings could be found by selling
redundant properties, and predicted overall savings from the review of
Pounds 16m a year after five years, once the new structure was established.
It said the Audit Commission had valued county councils' total stock of
property at Pounds 40bn, and transitional costs could be met by realising
just 1 per cent of this.
However, the treasurers do not believe that these sales will be possible.
Their report says: 'Where authorities choose to rationalise accommodation -
perhaps to a central location - history shows that the costs of new
headquarters (probably in the main population centres) tends to exceed any
realisable sales receipts as only the least suitable, marginal accommodation
would be released.'
Mr Robert Jones, the Conservative chairman of the Commons environment
committee, and a former vice-president of the Association of District
Councils, yesterday added to calls for the review to be radically altered.
Writing in House Magazine, which is distributed to MPs, he says: 'My advice
to ministers would be to relax the timetable and to ask the commission -
under a new, less bombastic and more listening chairman - to examine only
those areas where there is clear discontent with the present structure or
boundaries.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Producer prices show modest rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual rate of increase in UK producer prices fell to 3.7 per cent in
January, giving further encouragement to those who believe that inflationary
pressures are subdued.
Food and crude oil prices have been particularly weak over the past year,
according to figures published by the Central Statistical Office.
The output price index, which measures the prices of manufactured products
at the factory gate, rose by 0.3 per cent between December and January. The
annual rate fell back from 4 per cent in December (which included an
exceptionally big jump in January 1993).
If food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum are excluded, the annual increase
in the 12 months to January was just 2.6 per cent. This compared with 4 per
cent in the year to December.
Input prices, which reflect manufacturers' costs, fell by 0.3 per cent
between December and January, or 0.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted
basis. In the 12 months to January, input prices have fallen by 2.5 per
cent.
The statistics may give some support to the Bank of England's decision to
cut base rates last week, which the chancellor justified by saying that
'looking ahead, inflationary pressures appear subdued'.
Analysts at brokers Greenwell Montagu pointed out that a downward trend in
underlying prices - excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum - was
now firmly in place, so there should be 'good news for RPI'.
January's retail prices index is published on Wednesday.
Mr Peter Oppenheimer of James Capel said: 'Overall, the latest producer
price data are very supportive of our view that core retail price inflation
will drop below 2 per cent this year and will remain there through 1995.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Small retailers struggle hardest in thin recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small retailers are shown as performing particularly badly in the generally
downbeat monthly survey of distributive trades by the Confederation of
British Industry. While large multiple stores saw sales grow significantly
in January, smaller shops reported a decline.
The survey shows that of stores with more than one outlet, the balance of
those reporting an increase in sales over those reporting falls was 32 per
cent. This contrasted with a net balance of 16 per cent of retailers with a
single outlet reporting declines.
The findings of the CBI survey will come as a disappointment after recent
trading statements painted a more optimistic picture of the retail sector.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said:
'Although only four sectors report slight falls in volumes, most sectors
still say that sales are below average for the time of year.'
Before today's survey, tomorrow's official retail sales figures for January
were expected to show an improvement, largely due to New Year sales, after a
decline in December.
Mr Whittaker said: 'Looking ahead, prospects for retailers have changed
little from December. The increase in sales in February is expected to be
only slightly higher than the growth recorded in January. Expectations are
the weakest since last May, pointing to continued modest growth in
high-street demand.'
The survey shows that there were increases in sales across most sectors,
with booksellers, stationers, grocers, and footwear and leather retailers
among those showing the best improvement.
But specialist food shops, confectioners and hardware, china and DIY
retailers all reported that volumes are down on a year ago and all other
sectors reported similar slow growth rates.
Growth in wholesalers' sales volumes increased in January. They remain above
average for the time of year.
However, the survey reports that both wholesalers' and retailers' stock
levels are still too high in relation to expected demand.
Motor traders had a better start to the year, growing at the highest rate
since August 1988, and business is considered to be well above average for
the time of year.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Post-graduates 'underused' by industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry is being held back in the fast-changing areas of science and
technology by its low employment of post-graduate engineers and scientists,
a report said yesterday.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research compared British and
German companies and said that British employers were concerned that
post-graduates were too specialised and less likely than first-degree
graduates to acquire commercial and practical skills.
UK companies' limited use of post-graduates was also a result of 'the
relatively slow growth, by international standards, in British manufacturing
investment in research and development'. The institute also warned that
under-employment of highly qualified personnel by many British companies put
them at a disadvantage against foreign rivals.
It pointed out, however, that a strength of the British higher education
system - in contrast to Germany - was its production of young first-degree
graduates whose abilities (although not academic standards) were often the
equal of older German graduates.
The institute looked at the chemicals and engineering sectors. In
engineering, it identified close links between the German industry's greater
employment of technical post-graduates and its superior performance in
product and process innovations, with benefits for the country's export
competitiveness.
The German advantage, it said, is particularly marked in the high-speed
machinery sector but less so in chemicals.

</HEADLINE>

Business in shops, stores and supermarkets increased at the slowest rate for
a year last month, according to the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI's monthly survey of distributive trades shows small retailers as
performing badly. While large multiple stores saw their sales grow
significantly in January, smaller shops reported a decline.
Larger retailers however were more optimistic. The survey shows that of

FT  15 FEB 94 / Major stonewalls simmering debate on Back to Basics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major signalled last night a new determination not to allow
controversy over domestic policy issues to hijack the media's agenda on his
overseas trips.
As he arrived in Moscow for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Major's
aides told travelling journalists that the prime minister would not answer
questions later today on the controversy engulfing his Back to Basics
campaign.
As Mr Hartley Booth, the latest Conservative MP to attract unwelcome media
attention, stood by a refusal to comment on his resignation, Mr Major's move
was seen as a determined effort to avoid a repeat public relations disaster
on an overseas visit. Such trips have frequently been dominated by political
controversy at home.
Downing Street said Back to Basics would continue to figure prominent in
ministerial speeches. A senior government official even provided a list of
14 occasions on which Mr Major has made substantial references to the
campaign since it was launched at the Conservative party conference in
October.
The official said there was 'absolutely no question' of dumping Back to
Basics. 'The prime minister has made it clear that it carries a moral
dimension, but is not a matter of personal sexual morality.'
Cabinet ministers rallied to support the prime minister. Mr Michael Howard,
home secretary, said Back to Basics was 'an approach which, if properly
understood, has wide application in the field of law and order, of education
and of the economy'.
Lord Archer, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, told ITN:
'If we have a weakness in our party it is our inability to get over to the
country what has been achieved in 15 years and what a disaster it would be
to have the Labour party back.'
But Downing Street's sensitivity about the future of Back to Basics reflects
backbench unease about the wisdom of continuing the campaign in the face of
repeated disclosures.
Mr Booth, MP for Finchley, made no comment yesterday on his resignation as a
minister's political assistant at the weekend following the disclosure of
his close friendship with a female Commons researcher.
Mr Ron Thurlow, chairman of the local Conservative Association, said Mr
Booth had the full support of local officials. However, he said Back to
Basics was 'a gimmick' which should be abandoned. 'It's got a bit
ridiculous.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Banks 'misusing' clients' money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday stepped up its campaign to put pressure on the high street
banks over their use of the clearing system, as it accused three of
Britain's big four of deliberately delaying the crediting of cheques to
individual customers and businesses.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, the party's consumer spokesman, said that National
Westminster, Lloyds, and Midland earn an extra day's interest on retail
deposits by advising customers that it take four days to credit a cheque.
Banks are estimated to make Pounds 300m a year from the delay.
His renewed attack on the banks was rejected by the British Bankers'
Association, which insisted that the UK clearing system was 'the best in the
world'.
The association said yesterday: 'Any proceeds we do make go towards the
overheads of operating the clearing system, which costs Pounds 4.5bn a year.
This enables the banks and building societies to offer customers free
banking.'
Mr Griffiths said: 'With modern technology it takes seconds to switch money
from one bank to another, yet banks are taking the money out of customers'
accounts, investing it in the international money markets and three days
later crediting the business or other organisation.'
He added that Barclays was the only UK clearer to pay interest on retail
deposits three days after they are made, saying that this had cost them some
Pounds 70m in lost potential income.
The Labour accusation comes against a background of wider criticism of the
banks. A week ago Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said
they had wasted an opportunity to make a marked increase in consumer
protection when they revised the voluntary code of banking practice which
covers the relationship with personal customers.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Hurd urges united Tory stand on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday issued a clear warning to
the Conservative party to avoid re-fighting last year's battles over the
Maastricht treaty and concentrate instead on a common platform in the
forthcoming European elections.
In a speech in London before his departure last night for Moscow, Mr Hurd
set out the central planks of a manifesto which he hopes will avoid renewed
splits in the party in the run-up to the June poll.
Mr Hurd, who is drafting the manifesto, proposed a carefully balanced series
of commitments to re-affirm the Conservatives as 'the party of Europe' while
disavowing the centralist ambitions of some of its partners.
He told a conference of Tory candidates for the Strasbourg parliament that
the manifesto would offer 'a positive vision of a strong Britain in a strong
Europe, thriving, decentralised, free-trading and open to the wider world'.
It would have at its core the goal of renewed economic prosperity in Europe
through deregulated and competitive markets, low inflation and smaller
budget deficits, encouragement for productive investment and improved
skills.
Mr Hurd said that this British 'action plan' for Europe was becoming the
orthodoxy. Alongside the Conservatives' other goals of free trade and
enlargement of the EU to include the states of central and eastern Europe,
it offered the opportunity to build 'a less remote, more decentralised
Europe, which moves with the grain of popular opinion'.
In a move to reassure the pro-European wing of his party that the government
would not compromise its fundamental commitment to Europe, Mr Hurd said
there was nothing 'narrow or xenophobic about such ideas'. The EU was a
pioneer: 'We are safer and more prosperous because it exists'.
But in a careful acknowledgement of the sensitivities of the Tory right he
stressed that the Conservative message was 'the nation state is here to
stay'.
Enhanced co-operation on foreign policy would be based on collaboration
between governments acting on the basis of unanimity. There would be no
European straitjacket. Similarly the development of a European defence
identity would be within and alongside the wider Nato alliance.
Mr Hurd contrasted that approach with what he termed a 'Lib-Lab pact on
Europe' which accepted the integrationist agenda of the Brussels
bureaucrats. The enthusiasm of the opposition parties for a 'single
centralised state of Europe' was one 'locked in the past', he said.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Call to broaden Iraq probe to businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday urged Lord Justice Scott to widen his inquiry into arms
sales to Iraq by taking evidence from a group of senior businessmen.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's frontbench spokesman on open government, said
in a letter to the judge that the businessmen had 'unique access' to
information about the arms trade.
'They are the ones who actually fixed the deals with the Iraqis and arranged
for delivery to be diverted through Jordan or by other routes,' he said.
However, he said there was no suggestion that any of the businessmen had
been involved in, or aware of, any breach of the law or of government
guidelines.
Mr Meacher said the vital witness would be Sir John Cuckney, a former deputy
chairman of the TI Group, which owned Matrix Churchill, one of the main
conduits for arms sales.
He said the inquiry should also take evidence from two former heads of the
government's defence sales department - Sir James Blyth, now chief executive
of Boots, and Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers.
Mr Meacher also urged the judge to interview Sir Peter Levene, a former
chief of defence procurement at the defence ministry, who is now deputy
chairman of Wasserstein Perella, the US merchant bank. He said Sir Peter's
period as chief of defence procurement covered the 'crucial period' between
1985 and 1991, when government guidelines on arms sales were relaxed.
Others named include Mr Stephan Kock, a consultant to the defence equipment
finance department of Midland Bank, which underwrote some of the arms deals,
and Mr Frank Machon, a Glasgow haulier who transported some of the arms.
Mr Meacher said the inquiry should also hear from US government officials
and executives 'who had inside knowledge of British arms sales'.
Mr Meacher said Lord Justice Scott had focused 'for obvious reasons' on
ministers and senior civil servants because their knowledge of arms sales
was at the heart of the inquiry. 'But there are other categories of
witnesses who may well be able to supplement this material with further and
relevant information to which they have had unique access,' he said.
The inquiry has no powers to compel witnesses to attend. However, Mr John
Major, the prime minister, who has given evidence to the inquiry, has said
the government would consider giving such powers if requested by the judge.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Public libraries may move to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultancy, has been appointed to assist
government plans for contracting out public library services to the private
sector.
Five pilot schemes have been started to look at franchising libraries, or
operating the entire service by contract, and KPMG will publish an initial
assessment of the way forward in the autumn.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, said that local authority
responsibility for providing libraries was not at issue but that the
consultants would examine the scope for contracting out the delivery of all
or some elements of the ser-vice.
He added: 'My intention is to set out a range of competitive options for
library authorities to choose between, according to their local
circumstances.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / N&amp;P makes Pounds 2m provision for personal pension claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National &amp; Provincial building society, the UK's eighth largest, has made
provisions of about Pounds 2m to meet its potential liabilities in respect
of the 850 personal pensions it sold to people transferring out of
employers' schemes.
If that level of provisioning were reflected across the whole
financial-services sector, the total set aside for an estimated 500,000
pension transfers sold since 1988 would be more than Pounds 1bn.
N&amp;P's Pounds 2m provision comes within a total provision of Pounds 4.8m, it
emerged yesterday in the society's 1993 results.
Mr Alistair Lyons, the society's finance director, yesterday said the
provision had been set before the end of last year and before the full
picture from the pensions transfer study carried out by accountancy firm
KPMG Peat Marwick had filtered through to the society.
The KPMG Peat Marwick study found that nine out of 10 transferred pensions
did not comply with regulatory requirements, and that in a smaller number of
cases, sales agents appeared to have given suspect advice.
Mr Lyons emphasised that there was no particular factor in N&amp;P's pension
transfer business that made the society feel it was especially vulnerable in
terms of facing potential compensation claims from people who had suffered
as a result of poor advice.
'We took quite a generous view about the level of potential cases that may
need to be revisited,' he said. 'It may turn out to be a bit over-prudent.'
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is due to
publish guidance in July about how companies should compensate customers who
have been wrongly advised.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Container 'could withstand bomb'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Ordnance, the BAe munitions and guns arm, said yesterday it had
developed a baggage container which could withstand an explosion equal to
the bomb that destroyed a Pan American jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in
1988, killing 270 people.
The containers, which arrived at Heathrow yesterday for loading tests, could
be fitted in some aircraft by the end of the year.
The containers slow down the effects of an explosion, Royal Ordnance said
yesterday. A controlled explosion the size of the Lockerbie bomb only popped
three rivets on an aircraft's body, it added. It began developing the
containers immediately after the Lockerbie bomb.
Royal Ordnance, which would not discuss the material used in the containers,
said it would not manufacture them itself but would license other companies
to do so. British Airways said if they met cost criteria, it would
voluntarily begin to use them.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Labour accused of E London 'racism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats last night claimed to have received extensive leaked
information about alleged racism among Labour activists in east London,
Kevin Brown writes.
Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat campaigns organiser, said the leaked
Labour party documents revealed deep divisions among Labour workers about
the party's electoral tactics.
The claim follows disciplinary action by the Liberal Democrats against party
members accused of racism in Tower Hamlets, the only big city council
controlled by the party.
Unrest over the treatment of local activists threatens to boil over at a
meeting of Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat councillors on Thursday.
However, Liberal Democrat officials believe that the damage being done to
the national party would be minimised by evidence of similar turmoil in the
local Labour party.
Mr Taylor said the leaked documents would expose a cover-up of Tower Hamlets
racism by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's frontbench local government spokesman.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Transfer files 'must be kept'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial services groups are being told by their regulators not to destroy
any files relating to personal pension plans sold to people transferring
from or opting out of occupational pension schemes.
A meeting last month of a group organised by the Securities and Investments
Board agreed that all self-regulatory organisations should write to their
members warning them not to dispose such files. There is a risk, however,
that substantial numbers of files may already have disappeared because the
minimum period set by some regulators for keeping records is three years.
Pension transfers have been available from July 1988.
Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry,
wrote to its members earlier this month, saying that in spite of the normal
three-year period for record-keeping, members would find that disposing of
or losing pension transfer papers was 'unlikely to be compatible' with
observing regulatory principles of organising their business in a proper
way.
Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the fund management industry,
similarly wrote to its members a couple of days later.
The council of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent
financial advisers, is expected to agree a letter at its meeting tomorrow.
There is less urgency in this case, because Fimbra's normal limit for
record-keeping is six years rather than three, and so its members should
still have all their files.
SIB itself is notifying those organisations, such as banks and building
societies, which it regulates directly.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Eurostar train makes first journey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurostar train service, which will run from London Waterloo through the
Channel tunnel to Paris and Brussels, expects one in five customers to be
business travellers.
The service, which was inaugurated yesterday with a trial run from south
London to the new Waterloo International terminal, is expected to provide
tough competition for airlines. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, made
the journey in the driver's cab of the 400-metre-long train.
Business travellers are expected to account for 18 per cent of all journeys;
independent leisure travellers will account for 64 per cent; and inclusive
tour travellers a further 18 per cent.
European Passenger Services, the British Rail subsidiary which will run the
trains, said that on the longer journeys from London to the Netherlands and
Germany, the absence of high-speed lines will extend journey times and
business travellers are expected to account for only 5 per cent of journeys.
Customs controls on day-time services will take place on the train while
night-time service controls will take place at the start of the journey.
Prices have yet to be announced while the starting date for the passenger
service, which is separate from the car passenger shuttle service between
Folkestone and Calais, is expected to be in the summer. Eurotunnel said last
week that starting dates for both freight and passenger services would be
delayed.
The trains will provide a three-hour journey time between London and Paris,
falling to two hours and a half hours in 2002 when the high-speed link
between London St Pancras and the tunnel is expected to open.
Services between London and Brussels will take three and a quarter hours.
Longer daytime journeys will be available in 1995 with an eight-hour journey
between Edinburgh and Paris, a five and three-quarter hour service between
Manchester and Paris and a five-hour service between Birmingham New Street
and Brussels.
A sleeper service between Glasgow, Swansea, Plymouth and continental
destinations will be launched next year. London to Amsterdam will take 10
hours while Glasgow to Paris will take 12 hours.

FT  15 FEB 94 / MP quits front bench over trip to Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Worthington last night resigned as a Labour front bench spokesman
following his unauthorised trip to Somalia last week.
In his resignation letter Mr Worthington 'regretted the distress' he had
caused and recognised that 'party discipline was of paramount importance'.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, has withdrawn all co-operation with the
government for legislation in the Commons. He was known to be angry that Mr
Worthington's absence in Somalia, when he missed important Commons votes,
could be seen to undermine the strategy.
Mr Worthington travelled to Somalia with Mr Mark Robinson, parliamentary
private secretary to Baroness Lynda Chalker, foreign office minister in
charge of overseas aid.
The two men were taken hostage by guerrillas and later released. Mr
Worthington had argued that he had received permission from Labour's chief
whip, Mr Derek Foster, to go to Somalia. Labour argued that the fact that he
drew up his letter of resignation before he saw Mr Foster was an admission
that he had been in the wrong.

<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday employed further
delicate diplomacy to maintain British government efforts aimed at
encouraging all sides to embrace the peace process in Northern Ireland.
In an article published in yesterday's Irish Times, Sir Patrick used new and
more straightforward language to address some of the concerns and
uncertainties arising from the Downing Street declaration and to offer a
more detailed vision of what could lie beyond a permanent end to violence.
His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir Patrick has given the
hardline Democratic Unionist party a virtual assurance that the Anglo-Irish
conference will not meet while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter
Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the
Northern Ireland secretary indicated 'a willingness to suspend' the
conference.
The DUP - which is boycotting the talks process - last week wrote to Mr John
Major requesting a meeting before the prime minister's next encounter with
Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, on Saturday.
According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that there was no
requirement for the DUP to accept the joint declaration as the basis for
political talks.
In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated the government's
insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and that Sinn Fein must
renounce the justification of violence and commit itself exclusively to the
democratic process. But he also attempted to edge forward on some areas
cited by republicans as being in need of clarification.
His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds.
Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end to IRA violence,
Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks 'within three months'
rather than at the end of a three-month quarantine period. He said that once
it was clear that all terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits
to the community would include 'our ability to manage without troops being
deployed in support of the police and without emergency legislation'.
Sir Patrick said Britain 'cannot and will not adopt the role of persuader
for any particular outcome' and that 'with or without' Sinn Fein, the
process would go ahead. He added: 'We are, however, persuaders who urge the
really committed to search for widely-based agreement.'
In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick said he wanted to
see 'substantial devolved powers' in Northern Ireland but he emphasised that
this would not be done on a unilateral basis but through agreement within
the so-called 'three- stranded' talks process which includes the Irish
government. 'We cannot revert to a system of government in Northern Ireland
with which only one part of the community can readily identify.'
In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the rise in attacks
by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social
Democratic and Labour party, said members of his party were increasingly
being singled out as terrorist targets.

</HEADLINE>

   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern was expressed yesterday by Scottish Enterprise, the economic
development network for Scotland outside the Highlands, that bad publicity
would discourage businessmen from serving on the boards of local enterprise
companies.
The local enterprise companies have recently been under scrutiny from the
Scottish media, with attention concentrated on potential conflicts of
interest between directors' business interests and those of the Lecs.
Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, told the
opening session of an inquiry by the Scottish select committee of the House
of Commons that not one case of conflict of interest involving a director of
a Lec had been found.
Scottish Enterprise has been criticised by some observers for spending too
much on marketing itself.
However Mr Beveridge said marketing this year would cost Pounds 10m,
compared with Pounds 13m spent in the last year of the Scottish Development
Agency and the Training Agency, the predecessors of Scottish Enterprise.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Multinationals are flocking to Kazakhstan which is approving some of the
richest energy and privatisation deals in the former Soviet bloc.
Two years after the Soviet break-up, Kazakhstan is second only to Russia
among the 15 ex-USSR republics in attracting foreign investment.
Mercedes-Benz, Fiat, and Daewoo have all established sales offices in the
the country which is committed to a gradual move to a market economy and
mass privatisation.
Philip Morris is investing Dollars 300m (Pounds 205m) for a 88 per cent
share of an Alma-Ata cigarette factory and some tobacco farms. Almost every
big and many smaller western oil companies are vying to exploit the
republic's reserves, which some analysts estimate at 35bn recoverable
barrels. Kazakhstan is the second biggest former Soviet oil producer after
Russia, with an annual output of about 22m tonnes.
It produces around 12 tonnes of gold a year and contains much of the former
Soviet Union's silver, lead, zinc, copper and other mineral resources. The
republic's industry is based mainly on metallurgy, heavy machinery,
agro-processing, petrochemicals and textiles.
The International Monetary Fund has lent its endorsement to the republic,
granting Dollars 1.3bn to support the local currency, the tenge. Western
donors have pledged official cash worth Dollars 1bn to Kazakhstan this year
to help its transition to a market economy.
The Philip-Morris deal and a couple of high-profile oil agreements have
helped Kazakhstan partly to satisfy Western investors that, unlike many of
its former Soviet counterparts, it is a serious partner.
The government has tenders out for two large state margarine factories and a
sweet-making plant. The privatisation tenders, scheduled to close in March,
have attracted a lot of foreign interest, according to Ms Susan Bruno, a
local representative of the consultants KPMG Peat Marwick.
This is at least partly because successful buyers can expect to own the
plants almost outright, instead of the usual 49 per cent limit in many
republics. Later this year, the government also plans to privatise 38 big
state enterprises, but through local ownership.
There are, however, considerable difficulties; Kazakhstan has a daunting
combination of Asian-style personal business, Soviet bureaucracy and rampant
corruption and crime.
'This is not an easy country to do business in. The costs are very high,'
says Mr Ben Miller, managing partner for the Ernst &amp; Young office in the
capital, Alma-Ata. 'They are educated people. If you think you're going to
come in, take advantage of the locals and go home with a pot of money, it
isn't going to happen.'

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is preparing to set up an independent Zulu
kingdom in Natal Province, in defiance of the African National Congress and
the South African government, he said yesterday.
This move, tantamount to secession, will increase tensions following weekend
news that the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, headed by King Goodwill's
uncle Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, will resist South Africa's all-race
elections in April and reject the new constitution.
King Goodwill presented a memorandum to President F W de Klerk at a meeting
in Durban, rejecting the constitution and saying he would soon promulgate
one for a Zulu kingdom in Natal, 'which will establish a monarchy modelled
after the best examples of democratic and pluralistic monarchies in the
world'.
The kingdom is understood to include all of Natal and parts of some other
provinces.
Zulus retained their 'inalienable right to self-determination,' he said,
adding that, if they were unable to co-exist with other societies in the new
South Africa, the Zulu nation would exist 'on its own, with its own
territorial basis and with its own government'.
Mr de Klerk has met the king several times during recent weeks, in an
attempt to persuade him to endorse the elections against the wishes of Chief
Buthelezi. It seems likely the king will take his political lead from the
chief, as he has done throughout his reign, and reject the election.
At the weekend, Chief Buthelezi called for Zulu resistance to elections: 'We
Zulus must stand with our Tswana and Afrikaner brothers, and fight for
freedom, justice and democracy. We must stand together and fight the evil
lurking in the midst. If we do not, then we will fail.'

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday pledged Dollars 396m (Pounds 270m) in new
US economic assistance to Kazakhstan to help the former Soviet republic move
to a market economy and dismantle nuclear weapons, Reuter reports from
Washington. Last year US aid to Kazakhstan was Dollars 91m.
Mr Clinton, at a news conference with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, promised the aid after Mr Nazarbayev presented him with papers
documenting his country's decision in December to join the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty. He said he was prepared to extend another Dollars
85m this year and in 1995 to help Kazakhstan dismantle a nuclear arsenal
left on its territory after the collapse of the Soviet empire two years ago.
Mr Nazarbayev told Mr Clinton his country wanted to join Nato's Partnership
for Peace, which offers former Soviet satellites military ties to the
western alliance but not full membership.
Senior US officials lauded Kazakhstan as doing more toward market reform
than any of the former Soviet republics.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Japan coalition allies consider party merger: Speculation
grows of imminent cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading members of Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday proposed the
formation of a new centre-right party, amid press speculation of an imminent
cabinet reshuffle.
The calls, from Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of the Japan Renewal party,
and Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary-general of the Clean Government party,
could be the first stage in another realignment of political parties in
preparation for a general election sometime this year.
Opinion polls show the coalition could only beat the opposition Liberal
Democratic party under Japan's new electoral system if it fielded single
joint candidates, unlikely in its increasingly fragmented state.
Mr Ozawa, the coalition's backroom strategist, said Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa should lead the new party, which would support free competition, a
pacifist constitution and the United Nations as the guarantor of world
security.
Mr Hosokawa did not deny press reports he was planning cabinet changes in an
effort to bolster his authority after the recent upheavals over political
and tax reform. 'I won't think of it until the government finishes the draft
budget,' he said. The cabinet is due to approve the budget today for
parliamentary adoption in the spring.
Mr Ozawa, architect of the present cabinet, said the prime minister 'has all
the authority' for a reshuffle. But the possibility was denied by Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, a former close ally of Mr
Hosokawa, head of the small New Harbinger party and potential victim in a
reshuffle.
Considerable tension exists between Mr Takemura and Mr Ozawa, based on
differences over foreign policy and relations with the LDP, their own former
party.
Mr Ozawa wants Japan to be an influential member of the world community with
clear foreign policies, and wishes to split the LDP, the symbol of the old
political order. Mr Takemura is inclined to a more modest world role for
Japan and co-operation between the government and the LDP. The prime
minister has tried, with diminishing success, to strike a balance between
his two main allies.
Mr Ozawa said a realignment of political parties would 'progress at
considerable speed', once the revised versions of the government's political
and electoral reform bills had passed parliament, possibly by the end of
this month.
He and his close ally, Mr Ichikawa of the Clean Government party, believe
the new party would include most members of the ruling coalition, plus
defectors from the LDP and minus the Socialist party's left wing. 'I don't
think the present coalition members will all make the new team,' said Mr
Ichikawa.

his second official trip to Washington in two years, agencies report. During
talks with US President Bill Clinton, Mr Nazarbayev is expected to press for
a greater share of western assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
The Kazakh president will also review political and economic ties with
Russia and the fear of ethnic clashes between Russians and Kazakhs who each
make up about 40 per cent of Kazakhstan's population.
President Nazarbayev, 54, a former metallurgical engineer who become
republican party chief in 1989 and president in 1991. He has put economic
development before political liberalism and promoted economic reform. Mr
John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the biggest US bank, was the most recent
financier to visit Kazakhstan last week. Chase Manhattan is already there
and Deutsche Bank may be next.
President Nazarbayev still cracks down on dissent, controls the press and
the moderate opposition and he has also tried to protect Russian interests.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Banda nomination threatens reforms: Likely fallout from the
candidacy of Malawi's ailing president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress towards democratic government in Malawi may be threatened by a
deterioration in relations between government and opposition after a
decision at the weekend by the ruling party to retain President Hastings
Banda as its presidential candidate for the May elections.
Western diplomats believe that President Banda, who underwent brain surgery
late last year and was temporarily replaced by a Malawi Congress party
triumvirate, has been ill again. Mr Hetherwick Ntaba, external affairs
minister, said the president had suffered a bout of malaria and was 'in poor
shape' when he received British overseas development minister Baroness Lynda
Chalker a fortnight ago.
Local newspapers claim the president, who has made no public statement or
appearance this year, is being attended by specialists who want to transfer
him to South Africa, but that he is too ill to be moved.
President Banda was on Sunday formally adopted as the presidential candidate
of the Congress party, with Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, home affairs minister, as
running mate. It seems Mr Chakuamba, who served 13 years in jail for
allegedly plotting to overthrow Banda, is the party's real choice for the
future, but that the party cannot bring itself to relinquish President Banda
as a figurehead while he remains alive.
This has earned the ridicule of opposition politicians, some of whom are
calling for Mr Chakuamba's resignation on the grounds that he has failed to
halt a creeping tide of domestic violence. Several schools in the capital
Lilongwe have been attacked by armed gangs who have beaten teachers and
abducted students.
There is evidence that those responsible are Malawi Young Pioneers who were
forcibly disarmed by the regular army last year but have not yet been
formally disbanded. The gangs are thought to be targetting teachers because
of their role in the registration of voters for a referendum last year on
political pluralism.
In separate incidents, at least three deaths have been reported in the last
fortnight as a result of political brawls. In one case a university lecturer
was stabbed to death by a regular soldier, prompting a protest march by
students to the local barracks.
Further industrial unrest is also feared as the inflationary impact of the
floating last week of the local currency begins to be felt. The kwacha is
depreciating rapidly and retail prices for some food products have already
risen by 25 per cent, with an oil price rise expected soon.
Meanwhile, government and opposition have not yet agreed a formula for
replacing President Banda if he dies before the election. The all-party
National Consultative Council meets this week to discuss the issue which
threatens again to put other negotiations on the back burner.
A further area of likely conflict is the country's new constitution, to be
discussed this week at an all-party conference partly funded by the British
government.
An NCC committee is preparing a draft document with UN technical support.
For elections to go ahead on May 17 a final version will have to be adopted
quickly and without substantial revision.
However Mr Lovemore Munlo, justice minister and the government's
representative on the committee, has missed seven out of nine sessions, and
Congress party officials have said they are drafting their own document to
present to the conference.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday apologised
for sending out memos which suggested Japanese business organisations should
comment favourably on the government's recent economic stimulus package.
Mr Hideaki Kumano, Miti vice-minister, apologised for what he said was a
'misunderstanding' caused by a ministry document which urged support for the
government's proposals. The document was sent to leading business
organisations, including the Federation of Economic Organisations and the
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The suggestions were sent by the ministry last week to the private business
organisations, which represent many of the industries Miti has shaped
through 'administrative guidance'. The document recommended the
organisations evaluate the government's economic package 'highly' and
express support for the proposed tax reforms.
Mr Kumano admitted the wording of parts of the document was 'inappropriate'.
The unprecedented move by Miti was widely seen as an attempt by the ministry
to influence the comments of the influential organisations and was sharply
criticised after it was revealed in a Tokyo daily newspaper.
The ministry's attempt to elicit favourable comments from business comes
amid a trend towards reducing bureaucratic influence over industry and
deregulating the country's markets. Deregulation is one of the stated goals
of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government.
The incident also coincides with the ministry's successful deflection of US
pressure to use government influence over industry to boost foreign imports
into Japanese markets. The trade ministry, notorious for its large number of
industry regulations, succeeded in countering US proposals that Japan set
numerical indicators to measure progress in opening the country's markets to
foreign cars and car parts, on the grounds that such a move would constitute
undue bureaucratic meddling in private business. Miti denied it intended to
influence business organisations and explained the document was meant
primarily for internal use.
However, the document was sent on Miti's initiative and not at the request
of the business organisations involved. 'We read the newspapers so we knew
more or less what would be in the economic package,' a representative of the
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said. 'We felt that was the way Miti
wanted us to evaluate the package.'

<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten yesterday made an impassioned plea for
human rights to remain the major issue as Asian countries meet the
'political challenges of economic success,' AP reports from Sydney. He found
the argument that human rights were relative and some could be suspended and
make way for others unacceptable.
'Are some Asian leaders really prepared to argue that respect for human
dignity is an exclusively European or North American or Australian concept?'
he asked. 'I don't believe for a moment that human rights stop at the
borders of Asia; nor, do I believe, do most Asians.'

The Lebanese government yesterday agreed partially to privatise the oil,
transport and electricity industries, Reuter reports from Beirut. It is to
ask parliament to approve a draft law allowing it to form joint companies
with public and private capital to run some of Lebanon's utilities.
The government said it wanted private enterprise to share in running the
country's two oil refineries, its electrical power generators, public
transport and railway services.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Mandela warns of need for change: S African business
community 'will have to rise to challenges'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress and the man
likely to be South Africa's next president, said yesterday he did not
believe South African businessmen could be trusted to develop a
post-apartheid economy without state intervention.
In a tough speech to the International Press Institute, meeting in Cape
Town, Mr Mandela criticised the South African media for being
white-dominated, and implied this would have to change under an ANC
government.
The senior editorial personnel of South African newspapers 'are white, they
are male, they are from a middle-class background . . . the principal
players in the media have no knowledge of the life experience of the (black)
majority,' he said.
The economy as a whole remained minority-dominated, and this had to change.
'We are convinced that left to their own devices, the South African business
community will not rise to the challenges facing us,' Mr Mandela told more
than 400 international editors and publishers.
'The objective of our policies is to create employment as our highest
priority. While the democratic state will maintain and develop the market,
we envisage occasions when it will be necessary for it to intervene where
growth and development require such intervention.' One example would be
affirmative action programmes to promote blacks and women.
The ANC recently published a detailed economic programme calling for
selected state intervention in the economy, coupled with private investment.
ANC policy has always fudged the issue of how much state intervention would
be required to achieve the ANC's development goals. No clarity on this issue
is likely before April's all-race elections.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US weighs use of sanctions bludgeon -
Nancy Dunne assesses Washington's reaction to an 'unacceptable' Japanese
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is now so strong and wealthy that its massive trade surplus is 'simply
no longer acceptable,' US President Bill Clinton said yesterday.
After the failure of the US-Japan summit to agree on a plan to reduce the
surplus, Mr Clinton said he was reviewing all options and ruling out
nothing.
Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said
US officials had embarked on 'a series of meetings and a series of actions.'
But she said there had been no action as yet. 'We should not be talking
about trade war now.'
In fact, there may be no sanctions for months. Sanctions announcements are
likely and, if the administration's pressure is successful, negotiations may
follow.
However, the administration is united on one point: any pacts must be
watertight to produce results.
The administration's credibility is at stake - in Congress, with the US
public and with China, which is being told that the US needs progress on
human rights by June if China's Most Favoured Nation trade status is to be
renewed.
Officials yesterday acknowledged that the president was considering an
executive order that would resurrect the now expired Super 301 provision of
the trade law.
This would provide a domestically legal basis for a broad range of trade
complaints, followed by investigations, negotiations, and deadlines for
sanctions.
However, Mr Clinton added that he was considering 'some (options) that have
not been widely discussed that may offer great promise.'
There has been some suggestion, for example, that the administration may
gamble on a complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade alleging
that Japan's invisible market barriers 'nullify and impair' its trade
liberalisation pledges. This might assuage critics who say US unilateral
action is destructive to the world trading system.
The administration could also attack Japan's keiretsu system of interlocking
companies by bringing an anti-trust case against Japanese subsidiaries in
the US. The Federal Trade Commission has already begun an anti-trust
investigation.
Meanwhile, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has asked the US
Customs Service for data to be used in developing a sanctions list. It is
thought this could speed the retaliatory process if senior administration
officials decide a quick response to the summit failure is necessary.
The most likely area for sanctions is cellular telephones, with today set as
the deadline for a review of the cellular telephone pact with Japan. But
another candidate is the semiconductor deal, which was supposed to help
foreign manufacturers get at least 20 per cent of the Japanese market. The
target was hit in the fourth quarter last year - sales, slowed by the
Japanese recession, have been sinking ever since.
Last year, the Clinton administration followed its predecessors in setting
aside numerous trade complaints for the sake of getting the Uruguay Round
completed. In the same period, access to Japan's public works market was
agreed and its rice market was pried open.
However, a broad menu of options for sanctions remains: candidates can be
gleaned from the most recent of the National Trade Estimates reports, issued
yearly by the US trade representative. The most recent NTE devotes 27 pages
to Japan - more than any other country and 10 more than the EC - and there
is vast scope for trouble between the economic superpowers.
Japan's government procurement practices have long been a target of US
complaint. Sanctions in that area - in response to government discrimination
against US computers and supercomputers - would be likely to hit Japanese
companies that bid for US contracts.
Another pact the US could find actionable is the US-Japan Wood Products
Agreement signed in 1990. The NTE noted 'significant strides' made towards
reducing market access barriers, but concluded that 'satisfactory market
access ultimately hinges on the implementation of agreed-upon tariff
reductions in the Uruguay Round.'
Zero for zero tariff cuts were not agreed, and the failure convinced US
officials the Hosokawa government was less than serious about its
deregulation efforts. 'That alone would have brought down housing costs by
50 per cent  .. but they absolutely refused to do it,' said one senior US
official.
Japan's insurance market - one of four sectors in the failed talks - is
another nominee for sanctions. Japan has decided to begin insurance
deregulation in the areas of nursing home care, medical insurance, and
personal and travel accident - the only sectors where foreign companies have
access.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Motorola may spark showdown
</HEADLINE>

   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first shots in a US-Japan trade showdown could be heard today over a
complaint by Motorola that the Japanese have not complied with a cellular
telephone agreement to open their market.
The US company, which is the world's leading manufacturer of cellular
telephones, has struggled for years to make inroads into the Japanese
market. A review of the pact was launched early this year, with today set as
the deadline by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative.
President Bill Clinton yesterday said sanctions against Japanese cellular
telephones imported by the US were under consideration. He said the review
deadline today was 'quite concidental', but 'illustrative' of the
difficulties facing foreign companies in Japan. Mr Kantor could launch
retaliation proceedings, followed eventually by sanctions. That process
could take months.
In 1992, US telecommunication equipment sales to Japan accounted for about 4
per cent of the market and were dropping, from Dollars 699m (Pounds 477m) in
1991 to about Dollars 555m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, had talks yesterday with senior officials of the South African
government and the African National Congress.
This follows South Africa's participation in the final stages of the Uruguay
Round of Gatt negotiations, ending decades of passive involvement resulting
from international isolation and trade sanctions.
Mr Sutherland held meetings with Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance,
trade and industry, and Mr Trevor Manuel, the head of the ANC's economics
department.
Today he will meet President F W de Klerk and representatives of the
National Economic Forum, the tripartite body made up of business, labour and
the government.
South African officials have said the talks are part of private four-day
visit to the country by Mr Sutherland.
In the Uruguay Round sessions, South African negotiators secured what has
been billed as a tough but fair trade reform deal package.
The deal was reached only after protracted negotiations with South Africa's
main trading partners in the final days of the Round's negotiations in
December.
The high levels of protection wanted for the clothing, textiles and motor
industries proved sticking points, as South Africa was forced to revise its
original offer under pressure from the US and Europe.
A 45 per cent tariff on textiles - an industry badly hit in recent years by
low-priced imports from the Far East - is preserved, but the tariff on
clothing has been trimmed to 45 per cent compared with the 60 per cent first
offered and existing protection of 100 per cent.
The tariff protection for the car manufacturing industry is reduced to 50
per cent from 100 per cent.
Overall, the country's Gatt deal will see tariffs - which for manufactured
goods stood at 27 per cent or six times the Gatt average in 1990 -
simplified and lowered by a third on average in a phased reduction programme
starting in July next year.
The government is waiting for final acceptance of its revised proposals and
has until April to accept the conditions of the Uruguay Round.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Russia and China expected to lift sales of
spirits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging markets such as Russia, China and South America could double world
spirits sales within a few years, although sales of the top 100
international spirits brands were flat last year, according to Impact
International*, the industry monitor.
Total sales of the top 100 global brands were 268.7m nine-litre cases in
1993, with total world spirits sales at 530m cases, Impact says.
UK-based International Distillers &amp; Vintners (Grand Metropolitan) remained
the world's biggest spirits company, with sales of 43.2m cases, a 3.2 per
cent increase on 1992. United Distillers (Guinness), the second largest, saw
sales decline 1.1 per cent to 29.6m cases, but its higher-margin products
performed well in the price-conscious UK, as well as in Japan and the US.
Biggest loser among the top 10 companies was Japanese-owned Suntory, with
sales down 9.1 per cent, due to depressed demand in Japan and the US.
Scotch whisky remained the world's best selling spirit, with four brands
(Grant's, Teacher's, Famous Grouse and Passport) among the 15 fastest
growing worldwide. Johnny Walker Red Label remained the world's biggest
selling Scotch, with 6.8m cases.
The fastest growing spirits brand in the top 100 was Russia's Stolichnaya
vodka, with a 20 per cent sales increase last year, much of it in the US.
However, that was not enough to prevent temporary closure of Stolichnaya's
distillery in Moscow last week. In addition to Stolichnaya, the Kristall
plant produces a number of domestic Russian brands hit hard by increasing
competition from western imports.
IDV's Smirnoff sold an extra 600,000 cases in Russia last year, helping it
to a 4.2 per cent increase in sales worldwide.
Impact said the performance of western brands in Russia and two other
emerging markets, China and South America, suggested spirits were poised for
explosive growth.
China showed strong sales of Cognac, with volume approaching 500,000 cases.
Remy Martin, which has about half the Chinese Cognac market, increased
global sales by 2.7 per cent thanks largely to performance in China. Scotch
whisky is also catching on in China, with United Distillers selling more
than 100,000 cases.
In South America, sales in Brazil were especially strong, with brands such
as Dreher brandy, Sao Joao de Barra brandy and Presidente brandy all showing
strong increases.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia will take delivery before the end of the month of the first of 28
British Aerospace Hawk trainer and fighter aircraft ordered under a
controversial memorandum of understanding between Malaysia and the UK.
The Hawk order forms part of a Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.46bn) defence agreement
signed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then British prime minister, and Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, in 1988.
The Malaysian national news agency, quoting Royal Malaysian Air Force
officials, said that all 28 Hawks are to be delivered to Malaysia by
February next year.
British opposition politicians have alleged that the sale of the Hawks and
other British defence equipment was linked to Pounds 234m of British aid for
a dam project in Malaysia. Such a linkage would contravene British
government guidelines on aid.
Malaysia is undertaking a multi-million dollar programme to modernise its
armed forces. It will be the first country in south-east Asia with the Hawk,
though Indonesia has made a provisional order.
Under the terms of the Malaysian purchase, about MDollars 400 (Pounds 98m)
of the cost of the Hawks will be offset by the manufacture of various
defence equipment in Malaysia.
British Aerospace will also provide substantial training and technology
transfer so as to make Malaysia self-sufficient in maintenance of the Hawks.

The customs duties would take effect on Saturday and last for two months.
The prolongation of levies - to allow the EU Commission to complete its
investigation of the Japanese imports - was announced in the EU's official

The EU defines dumping as selling goods abroad for prices lower than
production cost or prices charged in domestic markets.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Canadian dollar dived to its lowest level in eight years yesterday,
despite persistent intervention by the Bank of Canada.
The currency was partly a victim of the strength of the Japanese yen and
European currencies against the US dollar. But traders said the weakness was
exacerbated by uncertainty over the new Liberal government's policies.
The Canadian dollar closed at 73.92 US cents yesterday, having touched a low
of 73.75 US cents during the day. It had closed at 74.43 on Friday.
Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, will table his first budget on
February 22. It is expected to include spending cuts and a broadened tax
base, but Mr Martin has indicated the deficit is unlikely to fall below
CDollars 39bn-CDollars 40bn (Pounds 19.5bn-Pounds 20bn) in the next fiscal
year, compared with about CDollars 45bn this year.
Currency markets have also been unnerved by indications that the government
is eager to push domestic interest rates down further. With the long decline
in US rates now ended, such a move would narrow the traditional spread
between US and Canadian rates.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Fuel blast lifts Haiti prices

The price of black market petrol shot up in fuel-starved Haiti after a
weekend explosion and fire destroyed a big depot for fuel smuggled into
Haiti in defiance of a UN embargo, AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
Fuel prices jumped from about 110 gourdes (about Dollars 8.50 or Pounds
5.80) a gallon to 135 gourdes since the blaze on Saturday night, according
to checks at several sales outlets yesterday.
Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel - increasingly precious in Haiti since
the imposition of the UN embargo in October - were destroyed in the blaze
that gutted a half-block of Rue de Cesars in downtown Port-au-Prince.
Authorities reported no casualties, and all sides blamed carelessness rather
than arson.
The area near the Roman Catholic cathedral had been transformed into a
dangerous stockpile of petrol, kerosene, diesel and other fuels. Most were
kept in plastic jugs and drums, and vendors often smoked while working, even
alongside trucks full of fuel parked on both sides of the avenue.
Two fuel trucks blew up in the explosion, and at least 12 two-story
buildings were destroyed in the fire.
The army has stockpiled petrol in underground depots around the capital, but
the fuel at the burned warehouses was the main source of sales to civilians.
With legal importers observing the embargo, Haitians have been storing fuel
in makeshift stockpiles throughout the capital.
The fuel embargo was imposed to punish the army for blocking the return of
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted and exiled in a 1991 coup.
With Haiti's poor - Father Aristide's main supporters - already suffering
the most by the embargo, an increase in fuel prices will make things worse
for them.

FT  15 FEB 94 / New debt crisis may hit Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American borrowers have raised more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn) in
the last four years through foreign bond issues.
But a new report from economists at the US bank, JP Morgan, suggests that
the debt crisis of the 1980s may be revisited on some countries in the
1990s, in a new form. It pinpoints a lack of growth in exports as the main
source of weakness.
'Latin America remains vulnerable to external shocks, whether on the trade
front or in the global capital markets,' the bank argues in a review of the
sustainability of Latin America's debts.
It says that such risks do not appear urgent today and that Latin American
economies are in much better balance internally than in the early 1980s
because fiscal deficits have been reduced or turned into surpluses.
But it argues that the region's trade and current account balances have
worsened since then, leaving economies vulnerable.
This deterioration has been due both to trade liberalisation and the renewed
availability of foreign capital.
'While these current account balances are readily financed at the present
time, because of the availability of external capital, the deterioration in
their external balances suggests that some Latin American countries may find
themselves unable to generate sufficient future foreign exchange earnings at
some point in the future,' the report says.
It argues that the current availability of external finance provides
countries with an opportunity to develop competitive export sectors.
Unless this happens - and the implication of the report is that Chile is the
only country where export performance has shown a marked improvement since
the 1980s - the countries may be vulnerable in the future to a sudden shift
in investor preferences.
The report says that some measures of capacity to pay have improved in most
countries since the early 1980s.
But one important criterion - the ratio of debt to exports - leaves Latin
America at higher levels than many other developing countries. Only Mexico
and Chile have substantially lowered their debt-to-export ratios in the last
decade.
However, other factors reduce the region's vulnerability to debt problems.
First, the base of investors is more diversified and therefore may not be as
sheep-like as commercial banks were in the early-1980s.
Second, external finance is going mainly to private rather than public
sector borrowers - although well over 30 per cent of Latin Eurobonds were
issued by the public sector in 1990-93.
Third, the new wave of Eurobonds has been largely tied to fixed rather than
floating interest rates, with only 4 per cent of the 1990-93 Eurobonds
carrying floating coupons.

The Mexican government's peace envoy said yesterday that armed rebels in the
southern state of Chiapas would release a former governor of the state, who
has been held hostage almost since the 45-day-old uprising began, Reuter
reports from San Cristobal de las Casas.
Mr Manuel Camacho Sols said that the Zapatista National Liberation Army had
agreed to hand over Mr Absalon Castellanos Domnguez tomorrow, in a move that
appeared to bring the government and rebels closer to long-awaited peace
talks.
Mr Castellanos was seized by the rebels on the second day of their new year
uprising, in which they captured several Chiapas towns.
The former governor and general in the Mexican army has been held by the
rebels in one of their hide-outs in the vast Lancondon jungle.
The Zapatistas said in a recent communique that he had been tried and
convicted of repressing indigenous people and given a life sentence of
manual labour.
The release appeared linked to an announcement by Mr Camacho on Sunday that
the rebels were making the long trek from the jungle to attend peace talks.
He gave no indication yesterday when the long-delayed negotiations would
begin, but Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal told reporters that the time
and date of talks were likely to be learned tomorrow.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Productivity seen as key to US expansion: White House
economist predicts investment will grow and efficiency pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic expansion in the US in the 1990s will be powered by a sustained
increase in productivity growth, Ms Laura Tyson, chief White House
economist, indicated yesterday.
This year's Economic Report of the President - the first produced under Ms
Tyson's supervision - predicts that non-farm business productivity will grow
at an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent during the 1990s, roughly twice as
fast as in the previous two decades.
The increase in productivity growth - output per hour - will compensate for
a decline in labour force growth caused by the ageing of 'baby boomers' and
permit the economy to grow robustly throughout this decade, she says.
Most economists regard productivity growth as the main source of long-term
improvements in living standards. Without an increase in productivity
growth, President Bill Clinton would not be able to deliver on his promise
to raise real wages for the bulk of middle income families whose incomes
stagnated during the 1980s.
Ms Tyson's prediction of a sustained recovery in productivity growth follows
release of encouraging statistics for the past two years, especially in
industry.
Manufacturing productivity grew by 5.3 per cent last year after a 4.3 per
cent gain in 1992. Overall productivity increased 1.6 per cent last year and
by 3.1 per cent in 1992.
The report says productivity growth will stay strong for three main reasons:
The baby boom generation that entered the workforce during the 1970s is now
fully assimilated. Today's workforce is thus older, more educated, and more
experienced than in past years.
The low level of long-term interest rates, reflecting expectations of low
inflation and a declining budget deficit, will result in a steady rise in
private business investment.
Targeted public investments in education, workforce training,
infrastructure, high-tech communications, and commercially relevant
technology will increase economic efficiency.
Private sector analysts would add that productivity is likely to be
permanently boosted by extensive corporate restructuring to meet the
challenge of more vigorous global competition.
The council of economic advisers appears confident that the current business
upturn will persist through this decade, making it one of the longest on
record. Ms Tyson predicts that real gross domestic product will grow by 3
per cent this year and by an annual average of 2.5-3.0 per cent from 1995 to
1999.
The unemployment rate (on the revised basis introduced this month) will
decline from a range of 6.6-7.2 per cent this year to 5.8-6.4 per cent in
1999.
The forecast assumes the Federal Reserve will accommodate a gradual increase
in inflation, from 2.7 per cent last year to 3.0 per cent this year and 3.4
per cent from 1997 onwards - a period when the Fed will be chaired by a
Clinton nominee rather than Mr Alan Greenspan, whose announced goal is
'price stability.'
In spite of the projected increase in inflation, Ms Tyson optimistically
expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain below 4.5 per cent and
6 per cent respectively throughout the forecast period.
The tone of Ms Tyson's report differs from those produced by conservative
economists during the Reagan and Bush years. It tries to debunk the notion
that higher tax rates damage economic performance, claiming that economies
'can thrive under a wide range of top marginal tax rates'.
Thus the US enjoyed healthy growth of 4 per cent a year during the 1960s
when the top rate averaged 80.3 per cent - nearly twice as high as that
imposed in last year's budget. While some people may cut their hours of
work, others will work longer to meet savings or consumption targets, the
report predicts.
Ms Tyson also claims that cuts in top rates in the 1980s led to a permanent
reduction in personal tax revenues as a share of GDP, whereas tax surcharges
in the late 1960s had the opposite effect. Higher rates under the Clinton
plan were thus likely to raise revenue and reduce the deficit.
The report also takes a different view of microeconomic efficiency, arguing
that this can often be promoted by government intervention.
The goal of the administration's technology policy, for example, is 'not to
substitute the government's judgment for that of private industry' but to
'correct a genuine and significant market failure - underinvestment in basic
research and in precommercial R&amp;D resulting from the divergence between
private and social returns to those activities'.
The rapid increase in federal support for commercially relevant technology
reflected the end of the cold war and the need to replace a 'defence-led'
strategy by one aimed at improving US global economic competitiveness.
Perhaps the most significant deviation from previous economic reports of the
president is a lengthy justification of the administration's deviation from
classical free trade principles - its attempt unilaterally to force Japan to
agree to numerical targets for increases in foreign companies' share of its
domestic market.
The report says 'the preponderance of evidence' points to the 'closed nature
of the Japanese market' despite Japan's nominal adherence to international
trading rules. The Clinton administration's controversial 'results-oriented'
policy is thus the only practicable way to tackle Japan's hidden trade
barriers.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Argentine opposition in turmoil over Menem deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's largest opposition party is on the verge of splitting over the
decision by its leaders to support President Carlos Menem's bid for
re-election.
Mr Raul Alfonsn, the previous president and now leader of the Radical party,
negotiated an agreement with Mr Menem last December, in which he pledged
Radical support for changing the constitution to allow the president to run
for a second term. In exchange, greater opposition participation in
government would be in the constitution.
A Radical party conference ordered on Saturday that Radical members of a
constituent assembly, to be elected in April to rewrite Argentina's 1843
constitution, must support Mr Menem's re-election.
Mr Alfonsn said yesterday: 'The Radicals' position is very clear. We all
have to obey the party platform.' His lieutenants warned they would enforce
the conference's decision, even at the cost of dismissing regional leaders.
Mr Alfonsn decided to negotiate with Mr Menem when it became clear that the
Radicals' low standing in opinion polls showed they had more to gain by
bargaining with the government than by outright opposition. But the
dissidents, led by Senator Fernando de la Rua, Radical leader in Buenos
Aires city, denounce the agreement as a sell-out.
The Radicals will hold primary elections next Sunday to select candidates
for the April election. This will indicate the depth of support for the
rival factions. So far, Mr Alfonsn's mastery of internal Radical politics
has guaranteed him the overwhelming support of the party machine.
However, his deal with Mr Menem deepened the Radicals' already severe
identity crisis. The hyperinflation and collapsing public order that marked
the end of Mr Alfonsn's presidency in 1989 discredited the party. Their
inability to provide a credible alternative to Mr Menem's market-oriented
policies made the problems worse.
Opinion polls indicate that, in April, the Radicals will be lucky to
maintain their poor showing of the mid-term congressional elections last
October. Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst, puts the Radicals' support
at no more than 25-27 per cent, while Mr Menem's Peronists continue to gain
ground.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Peru leaves banks in the dark over law on debt-swap interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peru has published detailed regulations governing the use of its secondary
debt in forthcoming privatisations. They specify that eligible debt
instruments will be accepted at face value, but do not cover how accumulated
interest and arrears are to be treated.
Although Peru's economy ministry considers the debt-swap law is crystal
clear, some bankers confessed to being confused and preoccupied over the
treatment of interest. A Citibank official in Lima said he 'could not
believe the Peruvian government proposes simply to ignore the question of
interest,' especially after it 'has taken its debt negotiations so seriously
thus far'.
The economy ministry calculates that around Dollars 10.2bn of Peru's Dollars
23bn foreign debt will be eligible for use in the privatisations. This
includes some Dollars 1.7bn of Peru's total debt with the Paris Club and
Dollars 5.6bn in medium- and long-term commercial debt.
Copri, the government's privatisation office, will determine in conjunction
with the foreign debt committee the minimum amount of debt and cash to be
expected in each sale - but at least 10 per cent of the base price must be
cash.
The price of Peruvian commercial bank debt has soared on the secondary
market in the past 2 1/2 years.

FT  15 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: American way of serving leads to
success - FT Writers on growing evidence that the US is top of the world in
services sector competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five of the largest US local telephone companies have announced in the past
few months plans to cut more than 55,000 jobs, so as to improve their
efficiency as new rivals enter what was a monopolistic business. A
combination of technological change, government deregulation and the fierce
US competitive spirit is slimming the US telecommunications industry
greatly. It is leading the world in the introduction of advanced,
inter-active, multi-media communications systems.
The upheaval provides a strong piece of circumstantial evidence to support
the contention that the US has a significant competitive edge over most
other nations in many service industries, telecommunications among them, and
that in some sectors the gap may be widening.
Claims of US superiority are open to dispute, since all international
comparisons of competitiveness are fraught with statistical pitfalls -
nowhere more than in the services sector, where output and productivity are
much harder to measure than in manufacturing industries.
Even so, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence, ranging from the
increasing threat that US airlines present to European national carriers, to
the popularity of McDonald's hamburgers and Walt Disney films around the
globe. A report published 18 months ago by the McKinsey Global Institute, an
arm of the McKinsey management consultancy, has given statistical backing to
the theory.
McKinsey conducted detailed case studies of five industries around the world
 -airlines, retail banking, restaurants, retailing and telecommunications -
and concluded: 'The US service industry has been fairly dynamic, and has led
the way to improved US productivity overall, compared with Europe and
Japan.'
Most studies of global competitiveness focus on manufacturing industry,
partly because it is much easier to measure its productivity, partly because
goods are more internationally traded than services, and partly because
highly visible sectors such as cars and computers tend to be regarded,
rightly or wrongly, as yardsticks of a nation's industrial health and
thrust.
Yet service industries account for more than 60 per cent of US employment
and roughly a quarter of US exports. Furthermore, the sector's productivity
has an important effect on the competitiveness of manufacturing industry,
whose production costs include a significant services element.
Among the McKinsey study's findings are:
Labour productivity in the US retail banking system, in 1989, was 32
percentage points higher than that of Germany and 36 points higher than that
of the UK. This was due partly to greater US deployment of information
technology, such as automated teller machines.
The US general merchandise retailing industry had higher productivity than
other leading economies, in terms of labour productivity, capital
productivity and total factor productivity. In labour productivity, the gap
ranged from just 4 per cent in the case of Germany to 50 per cent in the
case of Japan.
The US restaurant industry had productivity levels slightly lower than that
of France and somewhat higher than that of Germany, while the airline
industry has significantly higher productivity than that of Europe.
In telecommunications, the US has a higher capital productivity than Japan
and the main European countries, though its labour productivity is no better
than that of Japan and France. However, the report was compiled before the
current upheaval in US telecommunications - and that may be giving the US an
edge in labour productivity in a sector which will be particularly important
as the world enters an age of multi-media, inter-active communications.
Mr Alex Mandl, head of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's communications
services business, points out: 'In the next three to five years, the (US)
consumer will have the ability to access, through a computer or TV screen,
video services, conference services, entertainment services . . . . There's
no other country moving as quickly in that direction.'
What accounts for the apparent US lead in services? The main reason cited by
McKinsey is simply that 'competitive pressures on companies operating in the
US are greater than in other countries.'
First, the US has a more entrepreneurial spirit than many other nations. Its
businessmen seem unusually willing to take risks and financial markets to
back them.
Take MCI Communications, the long-distance communications group which played
the key role in breaking AT&amp;T's monopoly of the long-distance phone market.
It began in the late 1960s as a tiny upstart serving the St Louis-Chicago
market.
Second, the US began to deregulate its service industries earlier than other
nations. Airlines were de-regulated in 1978, when new entrants were allowed
and carriers were freed to choose the routes to fly and the fares to charge.
In 1984, an anti-trust court settlement forced AT&amp;T to spin off its local
operations and face full competition in the long-distance market.
Mr John Young, former chief executive of computer group Hewlett Packard,
says: 'With hindsight, the break-up of AT&amp;T was a huge benefit for this
country. The only way you learn to compete is by competing.'
Third, the US services sector faces the threat of foreign entrants,
attracted by the size and relative openness of the market, while it is
increasingly looking overseas for growth as its domestic market matures.
Mr Stephen Roach, an economist at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, cites
increasing global competition as a main reason why the US services sector at
last seems to be getting a productivity benefit from its investment in
information technology, which he estimates to have totalled Dollars 862bn
(Pounds 588m) over the past decade.
'The long-awaited payback in information technology is finally happening,'
he says. 'Back-office consolidation is breaking out with a vengeance in
banking, airlines and elsewhere . . . . Paper-pushing middle managers are
getting replaced by machines. Sales workers, empowered by point-of-sale
computing, are taking on a lot of additional functions, such as inventory
control.'
However, the US has no grounds for complacency. Other countries are also
stepping up their investments in information technology, while a wave of
service industry de-regulation and/or privatisation is under way in
continental Europe and Japan.
The opening of those markets will give US industries new fields to conquer.
But competition, leading to greater European and Japanese productivity,
could narrow the apparent US lead in services.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night became the first western leader to give public
backing to Russia's demand for full representation in the political
deliberations of the Group of Seven western industrial nations.
As the British prime minister arrived in Moscow last night for talks with
President Boris Yeltsin, British officials said Moscow should be granted
'full and equal' treatment during political discussions at annual G7
summits. For the past two years it has had only observer status.
Mr Yeltsin called for a place at the G7 table in a letter to leaders last
month. Officials travelling with Mr Major said the UK prime minister had the
tacit support of President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But
Japan, still in dispute with Russia over sovereignty of the Kurile islands,
was likely to oppose the move. France might also be less than enthusiastic.
They accepted also there was no question at present of admitting Russia to
the G7's economic deliberations. Other members are Italy and Canada.
Mr Major believes strongly that with Mr Yeltsin under threat from both the
old Communist guard and the Russian nationalist right, the west cannot
afford to treat Russia as a 'second class citizen'. He wants Mr Yeltsin's
application accepted in time for the president to play a full part in this
summer's Naples summit.
Officials denied any direct link with Mr Major's attempt to persuade Mr
Yeltsin to give tacit support to last week's Nato ultimatum to the Bosnian
Serbs. But they stressed that if the west expected Russia to continue to
play a constructive role in deliberations over Bosnia in the UN Security
Council, it had to offer Mr Yeltsin real influence in the wider
deliberations of the G7.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's leading radical reformers yesterday warned of an economic and
political crisis by spring - and made it clear they were now in complete
opposition to the policies of the present government, led by Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
The largest of the radical parties, the Russia's Choice group led by Mr
Yegor Gaidar, former first deputy prime minister, intends to constitute
itself as a fully-fledged political party next Saturday. A draft programme,
produced last weekend, claims Communist and fascist forces linked to a
criminal bureaucracy are planning a 'political reaction', while 'the
executive, in order to withstand reaction, moves further and further from
the course of reform.'
At the same time Mr Boris Fyodorov, former finance minister, warned
yesterday that, on present government policies, hyperinflation and financial
collapse were inevitable by the spring. The budget deficit could grow to as
much as Rbs100,000bn.
'There are some elementary things that have to be done: bring down
inflation, bring down the budget deficit, keep interest rates higher than
inflation,' he said.
'These are elementary things - but the government has done nothing. As long
as these trends continue there will be no investment, and thus there will be
no growth in production, and people will live worse.'
These similar estimates, coming the week before President Boris Yeltsin is
expected to focus on the economy in Friday's state of the nation address,
have underscored the radicals' determination not to support the government.
However, they sharply distinguish government from president. Russia's
Choice's draft says it will 'mobilise social, political and parliamentary
support for the reforms brought in by President Yeltsin since 1991. We
support the president who put such a strategy in place.'
Russia's Choice, which has been riven with dissension since the election and
from which a number of members - including Mr Fyodorov - have defected, is
now seeking to claim the prime place in reform and to claim that, while in
opposition to government policies, it is still the natural presidential
party.

Spain's recession bottomed out in the final quarter of 1993 and the economy
is set to recover very slowly this year, according to forecasts by the Bank
of Spain, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The central bank said annualised gross domestic product fell 0.9 per cent
last September against a drop of 1.4 per cent in June. By December, it
believed the economy had ceased to shrink. Final data for last year would
show that GDP fell 0.9 per cent, in line with the mid-year figure and in
accordance with the finance ministry's projections, the bank said.
Registered unemployment in Spain rose 63,000 last month, little changed from
a year earlier, according to new figures. The total stood at 2.7m, 17.9 per
cent of the working population.

<TEXT>
Ireland's government, employers and unions yesterday announced a new
three-year tripartite agreement aimed at holding down pay and inflation and
creating jobs, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. The accord links macroeconomic
policies aimed at controlling inflation and job creation to centralised pay
deals in the public and private sectors.
Centralised pay deals have been the norm in Ireland since 1987, bringing
labour stability and helping the government to cut inflation (1.5 per cent
last year) and borrowing (2.5 per cent of gross national product).
The deal allows for an overall 8 per cent pay rise in the private sector
from 1994-96, and 11 per cent in the public sector up to June 1997. The
additional 3 percentage points for public sector employees is a carry-over
from the last agreement.

FT  15 FEB 94 / A familiar spectre haunts Europe again: This time its guise
is Russian nationalism in the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week the parliament of Estonia protested against Russian 'imperialism'
and what it called its increasing tendency to 'see the Baltics as its zone
of influence and pressure'.
Estonia's action, a case of lese majeste by the smallest of the former
Soviet republics against the largest, is not a lone sign of alarm.
Throughout the states of the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and
increasingly in western foreign ministries, the spectre of a
'neo-imperialist', or at least a hegemonic, Russia is being fed into
discussion and giving an edge to formal statements which were once of
undiluted support.
For instance, two weeks ago, the US State Department expressed 'anxiety'
over reports that Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, had appeared
to say the Russian army would stay in Estonia and Latvia to protect the
Russian minorities there.
It is an issue which Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is likely to
bring up with Mr Boris Yeltsin today. As the first senior western leader to
meet Mr Yeltsin for a month - during which time western alarm has grown - he
will be in a good position to gauge the mood in Russia as it begins its
hardest year yet since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
While the elections in December, which showed so much support for the
ultra-nationalist and communist parties, proved a shock to the west, a
tendency to extend Russia's political and economic reach once more
throughout the former Soviet space had been observable for much of last
year.
Yet little or no public note was taken of this in the west where policy
(especially US policy) towards Russia remained that the country was by far
the most important among the former communist states and that it should be
treated as a friend. This attitude reached its apogee last month at the
Russia-US summit, where President Bill Clinton went out of his way to
reassure the world that Mr Yeltsin retained his reformist credentials.
Increasingly this view, pushed by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of
state designate, is under attack from within the US and within the leading
industrialised countries. Professor Peter Reddaway, a leading Russia expert
based at Washington's Peace Foundation, says that 'behind the assurances
about 'continuing the reforms', which the US has trustingly accepted at face
value, a new course towards authoritarianism is being quietly prepared'.
In a review of Russian policy towards the 'near abroad' - a revealing phrase
which Russian politicians, and the public generally, tend to use about the
other former Soviet states - Harvard University's Kennedy School claims that
a 'disturbing pattern' has appeared in Russia's relations with its
neighbouring states.
'. . . In each of the conflicts (in these states) there is evidence to
suggest that Russia has intervened in such a way as to promote their
escalation and/or continuation instead of their cessation . . . . In a
manner that would seem consistent with Russian policy, the sovereignty of
each of the former republics of the Soviet Union has been compromised,
forcing them into a dependent relationship with Moscow.'
This trend to domination and authoritarianism is now remarked upon in
particular by those most critical of the 'partnership for peace' initiative,
under which Nato offered closer co-operation with the central European
states but stopped short of offering them the membership they so wanted.
This, say the critics, was because the Nato states and in particular the US,
did not want to offend Russia.
'The risks of not extending Nato eastward are enormous,' says General
William Odom of the Hudson Institute, and former director of the US National
Security Agency. 'A new strategic divide will be drawn in Europe eventually
. . . . The issues are how, where and what kind of divide.'
Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, put the matter succinctly on the New
York Times last October: the Nato issue, he wrote, is in large part about
the domestic politics of Russia. If 'forces still enamoured of the imperial
ambitions of the former Soviet Union' increase their power they are bound to
see Nato as a threat: but if democrats win out, they will see that 'Nato is
not Russia's enemy but its partner (whose) expansion . . . would bring
Russia closer to a region of democracy and prosperity'.
The issue will increasingly be debated within Russia - especially as,
perhaps as early as this week, a treaty will be prepared which would unite
the economy of Belarus with that of Russia, in effect putting the first
under the control of the second.
For the democrats, this is at once absurd and alarming. Mr Boris Fyodorov,
the former finance minister, now a deputy in the lower house, said
yesterday: 'This is the union of two states, and it must be at minimum the
subject of discussion in the parliament and probably of a referendum.
Actually, it is less the union of the economies in a rational way but a
union of the red directors of both countries who want to re-establish their
links.'
Mr Fyodorov believes that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,the prime minister, has
made the re-establishment of the economic union one of his main priorities
in the year ahead: and that this economic union will take the form of a
political union, since the fledgling governments of these states will find
themselves tied hand and foot by Moscow once more.
However, Mr Sergei Stankevich, a leading member of the Party of Russian
Unity and Accord and former Yeltsin adviser, says: 'There is no way Russia
can ignore the fate of the more than 25m Russians outside of its borders,
and so our policy will be geared to that. But Russia cannot take
responsibility for these states again and any western view that these moves
are neo-imperialist completely misunderstands the situation.'
In the end, the issue is nationhood: can Russia accept its borders, accept
that the Russians in the 'near abroad' are, however near, still abroad - and
thus encourage them to become good citizens of another country? Or does it
still see them as its people - and thus the land on which they live as
Russian as well?

Alfa Cartel, Romania's second largest trade union bloc, said yesterday it
was postponing a general strike scheduled for tomorrow until February 28 in
order to join forces with CNSLR-Fratia, the country's other main union
confederation, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
In addition to mounting industrial stoppages and pickets, the strikers plan
to block roads and fuel deliveries, interrupt telecommunications every 10
minutes and cut bread production by two-thirds, CNSLR-Fratia said.
The two unions, which together represent 4.8m workers, are demanding the
government accelerate economic reform, improve the social security system
and take measures to solve the 'financial blockage'.
In recent weeks, many workers have not been paid because of a liquidity
crisis at highly-indebted state concerns. Inter-enterprise debt has risen to
an all-time high of Dollars 2.8bn, according to the finance ministry.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Germany faces a strike nobody wants: Damaging stoppage looms
after collapse of pay talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure last Friday night of top-level talks between the leaders of
Germany's engineering workers and their employers has put the rhetoric of
strike - and lock-out - back in the headlines.
The two sides now have slightly less than three weeks in which to head off
the threat of an all-out strike in one of Germany's main industrial regions
 -a strike which nobody wants, and which undoubtedly would be damaging to an
industry already in the throes of its steepest recession since the war.
Both sides stormed out of the talks in Darmstadt on Friday blaming the other
for inflexibility and a refusal to negotiate. Neither side is ready to be
first to propose new talks. Both say a strike is increasingly inevitable,
and the employers are threatening to match strike action with lock-outs.
Yet Germany's cautious labour laws, and the precise framework of the annual
wage round, mean that the process is not that easy or quick to put into
effect. Moreover, new labour legislation means that a strike could prove
considerably more painful, even for a union as wealthy as IG Metall, than it
used to be.
It is now up to the 14 regional wage negotiating commissions of IG Metall,
the 3.2m-strong engineering workers' union, formally to decide that
negotiations have failed, and that they want to hold strike ballots. The
entire wage negotiating process is decentralised, even though the final
agreement is usually the same for all of the regions.
That process will take the rest of this week - disrupted already by the
celebration of the annual pre-Lent carnival in large centres such as
Cologne, Dusseldorf and Mainz.
The regional decisions must reach union headquarters in Frankfurt by next
Monday, February 21. That is the deadline set by IG Metall's national
executive to decide on holding a strike ballot, which in turn will take
several days to organise, and at least two days to conduct.
Thus it will only be by the first week of March that the union is ready to
call full-scale strike action, and even then it will only be in one region:
a national strike would rapidly exhaust union strike funds. The region will
probably be either North Rhine-Westphalia, the traditional centre of heavy
industry where the employers are set to be most militant, or
Baden-Wurttemberg, the home of Daimler-Benz and Robert Bosch, among the
blue-chip industrial employers.
That should give time enough for both sides, in spite of their hardline
rhetoric, to have one more attempt at compromise.
IG Metall says it is ready to meet for more talks at any time, and at any
level. Given the failure of the national leaders to find a solution on
Friday, it seems likely they will try at regional level next time round.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union leader, has also warned his members about the
unpleasant consequences of a change in the employment promotion act agreed
by parliament last year. In future, union members who are not on strike, but
who are put on short-time working, or laid off, as a result of strike action
by their own union, will not qualify for any unemployment benefit.
Mr Zwickel made it clear last week that IG Metall had not got the resources
to pay such workers strike benefits either. It means that the union will
have to choose its strategy even more carefully than in previous years, in
order to maximise the immediate effects of the action, and minimise its
secondary effects.
Few doubt the solidarity of the IG Metall membership, if the leadership
calls clearly for strike action. But it is also obvious that few members are
enthusiastic, either. There is a widespread suspicion that many employers
may actually welcome an enforced period of closure, at a time of flagging
demand throughout the engineering sector.
Moreover, the union lacks an easy wage claim on which to seek strike
backing: the current claim, for 5.5 to 6 per cent, has already been
abandoned in all but name. The leadership has made clear it will settle for
a nominal rise, provided it is not an outright pay freeze.
Now the slogan is 'job protection' and 'income protection' with the emphasis
on the former. It may prove more difficult to persuade the membership that
the best way to protect their jobs is to go on strike. That is the gamble
the employers are taking, in pushing the union to the brink of open warfare.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Denmark calls for return to narrow ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark yesterday urged its EU partners to consider a return to the narrow
fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mrs Marianne Jelved, Danish finance minister, told ministerial colleagues in
Brussels the 30 per cent bands introduced after last August's exchange rate
crisis were not in the European Union's interests.
But her call for the European Monetary Institute to examine the possibility
of tighter bands met a wall of silence. Ministers made clear they intend to
stick to last year's decision to avoid a formal return to the pre-August
bands of 5.5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, fearful of provoking the
markets to launch another assault on the ERM.
The Danish krone, which came under fierce speculative attack last year, has
since moved back into the 'hard core' ERM currencies led by the D-Mark. But
the Copenhagen government argues that the uncertainty surrounding its
position inside the ERM means Danish industry is paying an interest premium
of more than 2 per cent.
Market observers have suggested that the Danish government seek a bilateral
agreement with Germany establishing a tighter link with the D-Mark. But Mrs
Jelved ruled this out yesterday as the finance ministers' meeting produced
no sign of immediate action on jobs, but included a debate on the
unemployment crisis marked by pledges to introduce more labour market
flexibility and to maintain budget discipline.
The UK, Denmark and the Netherlands joined forces at the meeting, meanwhile,
to call for a renewed onslaught on fraud in the EU budget.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, said it was vital for
ministers to incorporate more effective safeguards when spending European
taxpayers' money.
Mrs Jelved said recurring incidents of fraud identified by the annual court
of auditors report pointed to 'structural' flaws in the budget process.
The attacks triggered a warning from Mr Henning Christophersen, Danish
economics commissioner, that member states should not turn the European
Commission into a scapegoat. Member states had chief responsibility for
tracking down fraud.
Most incidents of fraud take place within the common agricultural policy
which accounts for around half of the annual Ecu 70bn (Pounds 53bn) budget.
But there is no accurate estimate of the extent of fraud, because most
remains undiscovered.
Ministers also gave broad support for Portugal's revised 'convergence'
programme, which sets targets for curbing inflation and budget deficits in
preparation for joining a future single European currency.
Lisbon's target of achieving a budget deficit below 3 per cent in 1997 would
require 'a thorough and vigorous' effort to consolidate its fiscal position,
ministers said.
Duty free travel allowances will be doubled, and in some cases almost
quadrupled, in the European Union from April 1. Ministers formally agreed
yesterday to increase the allowances for people travelling within the EU to
Ecu90 (Pounds 68) from Ecu45. The tax-free allowance for travellers arriving
from outside will rise from Ecu45 to Ecu175.
Germany will not apply the increase for travellers on land or sea until the
end of 1997.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Both sides have same priority - saving jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one thing on which both sides agree, in the conflict brewing in
Germany's once-mighty engineering industry: on the need to save jobs. They
have been disappearing at more than 30,000 a month over the past year, or by
around 600,000 since 1991, according to Gesamtmetall, the employers'
federation.
The trouble is they cannot agree on how to do it. Indeed, their alternative
proposals, which led to a breakdown in negotiations in Darmstadt last
Friday, seem to belong to different industrial worlds.
The solution proposed by IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, has the
attraction of simplicity. It is to cut working hours, at least as a
temporary, emergency remedy for the next two years. In return, employers
would guarantee not to cut any more jobs for the same period.
Such an agreement was negotiated last November by Volkswagen, with the
introduction of a four-day week for its entire workforce, as an alternative
to sacking some 30,000 out of its 100,000-plus employees.
In the first place, the union suggests bringing forward by 18 months the
agreed 35-hour week, set to come into effect in October, 1995. And secondly,
it wants to allow the national wage agreement to be made flexible, to allow
individual plants to negotiate deals for shorter hours, down to 30 a week,
as an alternative to outright redundancies.
The problem, as far as the employers are concerned, is that the union is
demanding at least partial compensation for the loss of earnings involved.
Each hour cut from the working week costs an engineering worker about 2.8
per cent of his earnings: the union wants some of that  - say 1.4 per cent
per hour - put back in his pay packet.
As far as Gesamtmetall is concerned, such a solution can only suit a handful
of employers who are facing a disastrous, but temporary, slump in demand for
their products. It would reduce their absolute wage bill, but actually raise
unit wage costs, already 40 per cent higher than comparable costs in France
or the US.
For a start, the employers say there should be no compensation at all for
loss of earnings for those who agree to a shorter working week: any
alternative would raise unit costs. It would make a full-time worker, on a
30-hour week, relatively more expensive to employ than a part-time worker.
Moreover, if a plant agrees to put only certain departments on short-time,
it would be invidious to pay those workers more per hour than their fellows
still working full-time.
Gesamtmetall's negotiators are certainly in favour of a flexible 'working
time corridor' for individual plants to negotiate individual solutions. But
they want that flexibility to include longer hours, as well as shorter, so
that plants can go back, in certain circumstances, to a 40-hour week.
The employers recognise that the 'VW solution' may suit some, if they are
working far below their normal capacity, and would otherwise have to pay
massive redundancy for thousands of workers. At VW, the deal was agreed as a
cheaper alternative than redundancy payments for 30,000.
'The VW solution is a way of coping with scarcity (of demand), but it
doesn't make any new products, and it does not open any new markets,' the
federation says.
Moreover, the employers point out that VW has still not been able to put its
four-day week into effect in its two biggest plants because of the
complexity of reconciling such a sweeping solution to industrial reality.
IG Metall is not prepared to give a blanket 'opening' in the wage contract
for plants to go back to a 40-hour week: that would amount to abandonment of
its hard-fought 35-hour deal, the union leadership believes. And anyway,
there is a clause in the current deal which allows 18 per cent of a factory
workforce to work up to 40 hours - and barely any employers are using it.
So, the union says work less and save jobs, and the employers say work more
and save jobs. No wonder they are so far apart.
And yet, in spite of the recriminations, the two sides have come a fair way
towards each other. IG Metall is prepared to see more flexibility in the
collective wage contract, which is already a big concession. It is prepared
to forego most, if not quite all, compensation for shorter working hours.
Gesamtmetall recognises that a shorter working week may be the right
emergency solution for some of its members. It insists that it is not
seeking a backdoor re-introduction of the 40-hour week - only for
exceptional cases. And it is no longer insisting on the outright scrapping
of holiday bonus pay, a red rag for the union negotiators.
The employers still insist they must have a cut in real costs to save jobs.
The union wants to guarantee jobs by working less all round. The difference
appears to be not so much ideological as a difference in the perception of
reality. That is a very fundamental gap to be bridged.

<TEXT>
Mr Yaman Toruner, a 45-year-old former bank official and currently the
chairman of the Istanbul stock exchange, has been appointed as Turkey's new
central bank governor following the resignation of Mr Bulent Gultekin last
month, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. Mr Toruner is the third
governor to serve under Turkey's prime minister Tansu Ciller since she took
office last June. Both previous incumbents resigned over policy differences
with the prime minister.
Mr Toruner's main task will be to restore confidence in the lira after last
month's 12 per cent devaluation. His chief tool will be interest rates.
However with rates on government securities already at 125 per cent for
one-year paper, the government is trying to restrain further increases as a
way to reduce its budget costs.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Turkish currency crisis takes toll in car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's two largest car manufacturers yesterday announced lay-offs and
production cuts following a sharp drop in sales, in the first signs of the
fallout from the recent currency crisis.
The sales slowdown follows a month of money market turbulence, and reflects
more costly consumer credit. The government has raised interest rates to
bolster the currency after a 12 per cent devaluation.
Turkey's economy grew by 8 per cent last year, but with output now expected
to fall across a range of sectors, growth forecasts for this year are being
cut sharply.
Tofas, the local subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, confirmed plans to cut output
by 33 per cent, by reducing factory shifts and sending 2,500 workers home on
compulsory leave. The French-Turkish venture, Oyak Renault, is to shut its
Bursa plant for a week.
Tofas, with 25 per cent of the market, reported a 30 per cent fall in sales
in January. The company is cutting output to reduce costly stock levels.
Tofas raised car prices twice in January by a total of 20 per cent in
response to the devaluation. Union officials warned yesterday that a
sustained slowdown could result in large-scale job shedding.
In 1993, the car sector was one of the star performers with production up 33
per cent in 1993 and demand fuelled by easy credit terms.
However the recent currency crisis is particularly painful for an industry
investing an estimated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 684m) to introduce new lines to
prepare for the competition which will follow the customs union with the
European Union.
In Turkey last week, Sir Leon Brittan, the EU commissioner, urged the
government to introduce a stabilisation package, warning that without
improvements in the economy, Turkey would not benefit from a customs union.
The customs union is currently set to be implemented in 1995. However the
latest crisis could derail the timetable. Turkish car producers are already
calling for a five-year reprieve of the deadline, according to a recent
study by Mckinseys, the US management consultants.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Striking French fishermen hit ports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Striking French fishermen yesterday blocked several Mediterranean ports and
disrupted cargoes of fish travelling from Brittany ports in support of their
demands for increased aid and protection against cheap imports.
Marseilles, Port St Louis and Fos-sur-Mer were among the ports blocked until
the afternoon by trawlers and other vessels.
Fishermen from Brittany, where the two-week strike has been centred, stopped
lorries travelling to Paris to check if they were carrying fish. Several
fish lorries had their cargoes dumped on the roads.
The protest, which saw violent demonstrations at the beginning of the
dispute, has evolved into a stand-off between fishermen and the government.
Fishermen last week voted to continue their action despite a series of
concessions from the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur,
including two aid packages worth a combined FFr450m (Pounds 51m).
Union leaders have demanded extra measures to protect the French fishing
industry from cheap imports and are calling for an emergency meeting with Mr
Balladur. But, since last weekend, they have also urged members to avoid
violence to prevent the loss of public support.
The French government yesterday ruled out negotiations or further
concessions. 'There is no question of re-opening negotiations,' said Mr Jean
Puech, the minister for agriculture and fisheries. 'The government has done
what is necessary and the measures respond to what was demanded,' he said.
In addition to financial support, the government has tightened inspection
requirements relating to fish imports. French officials say that the
inspection criteria are in line with EU regulations, but the measures have
drawn protests from trading partners, including the US.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Yen driven up by trade deadlock: Japanese share prices hit
by fears of lost export sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Nervous financial markets yesterday pushed the yen to its highest level in
five months and drove leading Japanese stocks sharply lower in response to
the weekend failure of the US and Japan to reach a trade agreement.
The stronger yen reflects investor fears that the Clinton administration is
determined to talk up the Japanese currency as a way of curbing a Dollars
50bn (Pounds 34bn) trade deficit by making Japanese exports more expensive.
The US administration said yesterday that it would not be hasty in
considering its response to the failed talks. President Bill Clinton said:
'We are reviewing all our options. We haven't ruled anything out.'
Asked whether US sanctions could lead to retaliation and a trade war, he
said: 'It could be, but I think they (the Japanese) would have to think long
and hard about it.'
The Nikkei share average fell nearly 650 points to about 18,800 in early
trading this morning after falling 531.45 in the previous session amid fears
that Japanese groups would lose export sales as a result of a strong yen.
In Tokyo early today the yen was trading at Y102.175 against the dollar
after rising sharply yesterday in New York where it briefly touched Y101
before closing at Y102.2. In London, it finished at Y104.1, against its
Friday close in New York of Y107.2.
Japan's leaders said they would take steps before the July summit of the
Group of Seven leading industrialised nations to deal with the deficit. Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, told his coalition partners that the
situation 'must be improved' and that the continuing surplus with the US was
'not favourable'. The government and private sector must both make efforts
to reduce the surplus, he said.
The prime minister received support from Mr Michio Watanabe, a faction
leader in the opposition Liberal Democratic party, who warned that Japan
risked a trade war with the US unless it worked out market-opening measures.
The US administration made clear, however, that any move to reopen talks
should come from Japan. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said:
'They understand exactly what the framework means. They understand the need
to open up their markets.' He said US officials would meet all week to
formulate a response to 'the failure of the Japanese government to live up
to their obligations'.
The renewed rise in the Japanese currency provoked concern from the Bank of
Japan, which said it would take steps in co-operation with other
industrialised countries if the currency speculation continued.
Currency analysts also warned against the dangers of the yen strengthening
too far. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted
that a 10 per cent appreciation in the yen would result in a 0.5 per cent
fall in Japanese gross domestic product growth. 'Even from the US point of
view, there must be a recognition that a Japanese economy that is expanding
is preferable to one that is flat on its back,' said Mr MacKinnon.
Mr Mark Cliffe of Nomura Research Institute in London said the strong yen
would undermine confidence further, squeeze profits and threaten more
labour-shedding.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Protests over seal exports to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International animal rights activists have clashed head-on with the
devastated Newfoundland fishing industry over a proposed deal to export
50,000 seals from the Canadian Atlantic province to China.
The International Fund for Animal Welfare said the seals would be used
chiefly for their genitalia. According to the fund, seal penises sell for
Dollars 170 (Pounds 116) each in the Far East, where they are a popular
aphrodisiac. They are dried and ground and infused into rice wine.
Ifaw yesterday launched a strong protest against the deal, which is being
negotiated between Terra Nova Fishery and Shanghai Fisheries.
It has enlisted the support of 109 British members of parliament from all
parties, who signed an early day motion calling on Canada to cancel the
deal.
The MPs say the slaughter of seals primarily for aphrodisiacs is 'as obscene
as it is absurd'. Many called on Canada's government to recognise the
revulsion felt in the UK and Canada.
Mr Walter Carter, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, insisted that the seal
order would be allowed to proceed only on condition that the entire carcass,
including fur, meat and oil, was used. Research suggests that seal oil may
contain an anti-cholesterol agent.
'We would not support any person who would harvest a seal just to get the
sex organs,' Mr Carter said. He acknowledged, however, that the authorities
were unable to control the end uses of any particular part of the carcass.
The Chinese order is more than double last year's Newfoundland seal harvest
and would provide much-needed business for the province.
Fish stocks have virtually disappeared from Canada's east coast, once one of
the world's richest fishing grounds. Ottawa banned cod fishing off the coast
of Newfoundland last month, putting 30,000 people out of work.
'Newfoundlanders can't even catch a fish for their own table for the first
time in 500 years,' Mr Carter said yesterday.
Newfoundland's seal population has risen rapidly to an estimated 3m-4m since
harvesting was cut in the 1980s after a highly effective protest against
clubbing seal pups for fur.
Marine biologists suspect that the seals, which each eat about 20 lbs of
fish a day, have contributed to the demise of the fishery. Mr Carter
believes that up to 180,000 animals could be killed each year without posing
any threat to the species.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Brussels to fine steel groups over cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will fine leading European steel manufacturers
tomorrow for operating a cartel in heavy steel sections and beams for the
construction industry.
Up to 20 companies in seven EU member states and three Nordic countries have
been found to be distorting competition in European steel products,
breaching the European Coal and Steel Treaty which bans price-fixing and the
sharing out of markets, a senior Brussels official said.
Brussels' action comes as the Commission steps up pressure on private
steelmakers to cut production, as part of the restructuring plan agreed by
the 12 just before Christmas.
Among steelmakers facing fines are Arbed, British Steel, Fried Krupp-Hoesch,
NMH Stahlwerke, Saarstahl and Fundia Norske, officials confirmed.
The level of fine will be set at a meeting tonight of senior Brussels
officials, which will take place at the same time as a Brussels dinner
between Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, Mr Martin
Bangemann, the industry commissioner, and leading steelmakers grouped in
Eurofer, the industry association.
An official said the competition directorate 'would like to have a serious
fine' imposed, but that the level of sanction would be subject to 'a
political appreciation'. Fines can be levied up to 10 per cent of annual
sales in the sector, but an official said the normal level was about 2 per
cent of turnover.
The fines follow a three-year investigation. Officials do not deny that
bringing the inquiry to a head now will put pressure on Europe's private
steelmakers to accept the crisis measures adopted last year.
In December, EU industry ministers approved Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in
government subsidies for state-owned steelmakers, mainly in Italy, Germany
and Spain, in return for capacity cuts of more than 5m tonnes. But as part
of the deal, the Commission is looking for cuts of 25m tonnes from non-aided
producers, provoking angry resistance from private steelmakers.
The steel industry has until now escaped the heavy sanctions for competition
distortion that Brussels has imposed in other sectors, such as chemicals and
paper and board.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Lloyd's Names reject Pounds 900m on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lossmaking Lloyd's Names decisively rejected the insurance market's Pounds
900m settlement offer yesterday, and so signalled their intentions to pursue
compensation through court action.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, said: 'I regret the final result.
Litigation is an untidy, lengthy and expensive route. It may yield benefit
to some who have chosen it, but I fear that others will be disappointed in
that course.'
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said: 'There are still people
who believe we'll make a new offer, but it's dead and finished.'
Only 38 per cent of the value of the offer was taken up by Names, the
individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, leaving
Lloyd's short of its minimum 70 per cent target.
'The offer has therefore lapsed and the forms of assent will be destroyed,'
said Mr Rowland in a letter to Names.
A consequence of the rejection was the decision by JIB Group to liquidate
one of its Lloyd's agency subsidiaries as a result of its contingent
liabilities stemming from Names' legal actions.
Mr Middleton said he had been surprised by the number of individual
acceptances, which had exceeded 50 per cent - 12,103 out of 23,488 Names.
Lloyd's could not commit part of the central fund - which meets claims when
Names are unable to fulfil their obligations - to any future deal. Of the
Pounds 900m on offer until yesterday, Pounds 450m was from the fund. Errors
and omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for
negligence, would have provided most of the balance.
Although the offer was weighted in favour of Names who were members of
syndicates specialising in 'spiral' reinsurance - in which syndicates and
companies cover each others' high-level catastrophe losses - their decision
was a decisive factor in the deal's failure. 'It was those syndicate action
groups who, by not accepting the offer and so indicating their determination
to continue the litigation, exerted most influence on the outcome,' said Mr
Rowland.
A case by some 3,000 Gooda Walker Names - the biggest of the legal actions
under consideration - is to come before the courts in April.
Mr Tom Benyon, a director of the Society of Names, which represents
lossmakers, said: 'Names are moving from one vale of tears to another, from
a flawed offer to expensive litigation.'

FT  14 FEB 94 / Viacom pulls ahead in Paramount bid stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the US cable television group, last night looked the clear favourite
to win the Dollars 10bn battle for control of Paramount Communications,
which formally comes to a close tonight.
QVC Network, the rival bidder in the five-month struggle, said yesterday
that it would not raise its own bid further.
Since investors last week expressed a clear preference for Viacom's offer,
it seemed likely that Sumner Redstone's cable television group would come
out in front.
It remained unclear, though, whether Viacom would be able to muster enough
support to declare an outright victory by tonight.
If it does not speak for at least 50.1 per cent of Paramount's shares, then
the formal bidding process for the group will end and the battle will
collapse into a free-for-all.
QVC's statement yesterday that it would not offer more for Paramount came
after a succession of hints last week that it might change the terms of its
bid.
'We said we would not bid above the prudent value for the company, and we
haven't,' it said.
QVC added, though, that it believed it would be a better owner of Paramount
than Viacom, and it continued to question some aspects of Viacom's bid.
Viacom's B shares dropped by 4 per cent in New York on Friday, signalling a
clear belief that it will come out on top in the five-month battle.
Investors fear that whichever company is the victor will be weighed down
financially by the takeover.
The price of Viacom's B shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 5/8 on
Friday in a trading session which was shortened by an early stock market
close due to bad weather. The shares have now almost halved in value since
last September, when Sumner Redstone's cable TV group first bid for
Paramount.
While both offers for Paramount are worth around Dollars 10bn, Viacom has
won Wall Street's support with a higher cash component in its bid, along
with guarantees for Paramount shareholders should its own share price fall
in the year after a takeover.
At five months and two days, the Paramount bidding war is now just two days
short of the record five-month, four-day takeover of computer company NCR in
1991, the longest takeover fight in recent Wall Street history.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Tax on felling forests urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should introduce a tax on timber to reflect the
environmental cost of cutting down forests, according to Mr Ioannis
Paleokrassas, environment commissioner.
'Timber is a resource we could price more correctly,' he said. 'If we carry
on as we are, forests will be decimated.'
A timber tax would be graded according to the origin of the timber, he said
in London last week. Timber from old, native forests would be taxed more
heavily than that from replanted forests.
The tax would apply both to imports and to wood from Europe.
He denied it would conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
His comments drew a sharp response from Brazilian timber exporters. Mr Claes
Hall, European spokesman for Brazil's Cellulose Exporters' Association
(Abecel), said: 'We grow timber in plantations like a crop - any tax should
recognise the difference between this and wood from native forests, and
plantation timber or products made from it should not be taxed.'
Finland's ministry of external economic relations said such a tax could
affect timber exports, though Finland believed that it managed its forest
better than many other countries.
Finland, one of the largest timber exporters in Europe, is negotiating EU
membership.
However, Mr Paleokrassas's plan is an at an embryonic stage. He has yet to
decide a timetable for turning the tree tax idea into a formal proposal.
Even if he were to table the plan it would have to navigate obstacles which
have stalled other proposed European 'eco-taxes', notably a tax on energy
and its carbon content.
Member countries have complained that such taxes are a handicap to
industrial competitiveness.
The Commission, which has been criticised by member countries for failing to
enforce its extensive environmental regulations and directives, has said
recently that it prefers to use 'financial instruments' such as taxes to
pursue environmental aims.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Growth and jobs dominate finance talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising unemployment and poor short-term prospects for economic growth in
Europe will dominate the agenda when European Union finance ministers meet
in Brussels today.
Talks will focus on how to carry out prescriptions in the Delors White Paper
on employment and growth, which were approved at the Brussels summit last
December.
Greece, which is to chair the talks today, has pledged to make the White
Paper the centrepiece of its six-month EU presidency.
But its efforts will be complicated by the ideological faultline within the
EU over how best to generate growth and improve competitiveness.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to urge his
partners to follow the British model and improve labour market flexibility.
As he did in a recent speech in Paris, Mr Clarke will reject accusations
that such steps have undermined the UK welfare state.
But other member states remain wary of moves which could provoke labour
unrest at home. France, which has seen violent protests by fishermen,
farmers and airline workers in recent months, will point to its policy of
encouraging public and consumer spending to spur its faltering recovery.
The opening debate among ministers is to be televised.
Diplomats are watching for coded calls to the Bundesbank to bring forward
the interest rate cuts which market observers believe is the best hope for
an early recovery.
Ministers will also consider a revised Portuguese 'convergence' plan which
includes commitments to curb budget deficits and attack inflation, so as to
prepare for the planned creation of a single European currency by the end of
the decade.
The Portuguese plan will be the first of several revised programmes from
other member states, following monetary turbulence last year.
As a separate item, Mr Clarke will raise concerns that an earlier political
commitment by heads of government, to protect farmers from the effects of
currency turmoil, could open the door to a flood of fresh spending.
The commitment to take 'appropriate steps' to compensate farmers for big
swings in currencies was made at the December 1992 summit in Edinburgh, as
part of the seven-year budget agreement.
According to legal advisers in Brussels, the commitment could allow member
states to use a qualified majority to trigger extra spending if that were
incorporated in legal form, overriding the traditional need for unanimity on
spending matters.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has decreed that nationals of 13 countries will need exit visas to
leave the country, reviving a measure adopted in the mid-1980s to combat
terrorism, AP reports from Paris.
The countries include Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, North
Korea, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Sudan and Yemen.
Palestinians will also need visas.
The decree signed by Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, was published at
the weekend in the Official Journal, meaning that it took effect as law.
Interior ministry officials refused to comment on why the order was adopted.
It mirrored a measure covering most other countries adopted in 1986 as a
weapon in the battle against terrorism.
Store owners in ports along France's Brittany coast closed their doors on
Saturday afternoon in sympathy with striking fishermen who are pressing the
government for more aid to offset low prices, Reuter reports from Rennes.
Authorities said several thousand people marched in silence in the port of
Le Guilvinec, where the strike began.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Board unlikely to approve CDollars
2.8bn takeover bid - Maclean Hunter/Rogers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and broadcast group,
will meet this week to consider its response to a takeover bid worth at
least CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.1bn) from Rogers Communications of
Toronto.
Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable TV distributor, ended two weeks of
speculation last Friday by offering CDollars 17 per share, plus a portion of
the proceeds from the sale of MH's US cable TV franchises, if they realise
more than CDollars 1.5bn after expenses. Rogers has already bought an 8.3
per cent stake in MH on the open market.
Mr Robert Furse, Maclean Hunter's chief financial officer, said the
company's advisers met over the weekend to consider the Rogers bid and other
meetings would be necessary to formulate a response.
MH is unlikely to give its unqualified approval. Expectations that the
Rogers offer is not the last word were reflected in a 38 per cent rise in
MH's share price last Friday to CDollars 17.38. The alternatives being
explored by MH include alliances with other companies, a recapitalisation
and the sale of its cable TV business.
Among the uncertainties facing Rogers is whether the MH board will allow the
bid. MH's shareholder rights plan makes a takeover all but impossible unless
it is permitted by the board.
Mr Ted Rogers, Rogers' entrepreneurial founder and chief executive, insisted
that the bid would not be raised. 'If we were not successful, someone would
have to come in with an ego, and overpay.' Rogers has arranged financing of
CDollars 2.7bn.
Mr Rogers claims the merger is needed to create a Canadian multi-media group
powerful enough to stand up to big foreign predators, as well as the
domestic telephone industry. 'If we're all small and timid in this country,
we'll be overwhelmed,' he said.

Middle East peace talks
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are due to resume talks in
Paris and Egypt. They hope to build on last week's breakthrough concerning
security accords in Cairo.
In Paris, the two sides are expected to continue hammering out an agreement
on trade, taxation, currency, finance and banking. In Egypt, they will seek
to conclude discussions on the role of a Palestinian police force and the
transfer of civilian administration from Israeli to Palestinian hands.
Sutherland to meet de Klerk
South Africa's integration into the international community continues with a
visit by Gatt chief Peter Sutherland (left).
He will discuss economic reform with President F. W. de Klerk and the
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
Albania's foreign minister
Albania's foreign minister Alfred Serreqi holds talks in Athens on
co-operation with the European Union and bilateral issues. It is the first
visit by a senior Albanian official since Greece's socialist government took
over in October.
The two countries have been on bad terms since last summer over alleged
mistreatment of the Greek minority in Albania and expulsions from Greece of
Albanian workers.
Kazakhstan president
Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev meets US president Bill Clinton in
Washington. Considered the most effective reformer in the former soviet
republics, Nazarbayev will press for a greater share of western assistance
to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Lloyd's compensation offer
Today is the official deadline for loss-making Lloyd's Names to accept the
insurance market's Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer, but Lloyd's is
expected to extend it. The insurance market has said the proposed settlement
would be withdrawn unless it was accepted by loss-making Names whose
individual deals account for at least 70 per cent of the Pounds 900m on
offer. However, if a significant number of Names accept the deal, a short
extension of the offer period may be considered.

Major and Hurd in Moscow
UK prime minister John Major and defence secretary Douglas Hurd begin two
days of talks in Moscow. They will try to persuade Russian president Boris
Yeltsin that the Nato ultimatum threatening air strikes against Serbian
forces does not signal a break with the West's commitment to a negotiated
settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Major will also stress that western financial support for President
Yeltsin depends on reform continuing. Mr Hurd plans to hold a meeting with
the leaders of the three Baltic states in the Latvian capital Riga.
Belarus protest
Committees at some 22 enterprises plan a one-day protest to demand the
resignation of the conservative government and early elections. Stanislav
Shushkevich, ousted as head of state last month, has said elections are the
only way to stop market reforms from being blocked by bureaucrats who do not
want to let go of economic power.
Japanese budget
The Hosokawa government adopts a final budget for the fiscal year starting
on April 1. The finance ministry has called for austerity following the
record Y15,250bn (Dollars 1.4bn) pump-priming package. The ministry's draft
calls for a 1 per cent rise in total outlays to Y73,081bn.
Middle East bilateral peace talks
Middle East bilateral peace talks between Israel and Syria, Jordan, Lebanon
and the Palestinians are due to resume in Washington. The Syrians,
Jordanians and Lebanese are trying to make progress with Israel towards a
comprehensive Middle East peace - the heart of which is an agreement on
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights in return for full
peace.
The Israeli-Palestinian talks will focus on agreeing a protocol for holding
Palestinian elections under the peace accord for Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
Europe's steelmakers and the European Commission meet
Europe's steelmakers and the European Commission meet in Brussels to discuss
the continuing crisis in the industry. After December's controversial
agreement by European Union industry ministers, approving Ecu6.8bn (Pounds
5.1bn) of state aid in return for 5m tonnes of capacity cuts, non-aided
producers are holding back from offering capacity reductions. They want the
Commission to take a tougher line on subsidies.
UK manufacturing output
UK manufacturing output's rise in the past three months is expected to
continue, providing further evidence of economic recovery. The consensus
forecast for December's figures is an increase of 0.3 per cent on November.
The annual rate is expected to pick up to 3.5 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in
November.

S Korea's message to US
South Korea's foreign minister Han Sung-joo (left) begins a visit to the US
(to Feb 19). It was originally planned as a trade trip in connection with
the creation of the North American Free Trade area. However, as Seoul
becomes increasingly concerned the war of words between the US and North
Korea may escalate into confrontation, Mr Han is likely to recommend the US
adopts a more conciliatory tone. On Saturday, he goes on to Mexico (to Feb
23).
UK retail price index
UK retail price index for January will be scrutinised, after last week's
surprise interest rate cut. As the Bank of England's quarterly inflation
report spoke of an 'asymmetric risk' that 'a rise in underlying inflation
seems more likely than a further fall', analysts will be looking for
evidence that the cut was justified.
The headline rate is expected to rise to 2.6 per cent, from 1.9 per cent in
December, as mortgage rate cuts in January 1993 drop out of the annual
figure. Underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) is
expected to rise from 2.7 to 3 per cent.
Papal letter on the Family
The Pope's Letter for the Year of the Family is due to be published. The

Veritatis Splendor, which attacked a relativistic approach to morality.

Padraig Flynn, European Union social affairs commissioner, presents a
proposal on immigration and asylum policy to the Commission. It will
recommend that immigrants legally resident in any member state should have
the right to travel and to seek employment throughout the EU.
CDollars 14m charge
A former personal banking consultant with Royal Bank of Canada, Shamin
Alidina, is due to appear in a Toronto court on fraud charges involving
CDollars 14m (USDollars 11m). Ms Alidina is accused of removing money from
72 customer accounts over a period of five years on the pretext of buying
treasury bills. The bank has recovered CDollars 6.4m, but faces losses of
more than CDollars 7m. The customers are being repaid.

Cypriot leaders to meet
President Glafkos Clerides of Cyprus and Rauf Denktash, leader of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the divided island, are due
to meet in Nicosia.
The talks are to be chaired by Joe Clark, the former Canadian prime
minister, now United Nations special envoy on Cyprus. Both leaders have
agreed to a UN plan on confidence-building measures to improve relations
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. These would include
re-opening Nicosia airport and giving the Greek side access to Varosha, a
suburb of Famagusta, after almost 20 years.
Bundesbank council meets
The policy-making council of the German central bank holds its regular
fortnightly get-together to review monetary policy and consider whether
interest rates should be reduced.
Markets have almost given up hope that the discount rate will be cut from
the 5.75 per cent at which it has been since October.
US Consumer price data
US Consumer price data for January have been exciting financial markets
since the Federal Reserve's recent decision to push interest rates up a
quarter-point last week.
The consensus expectation is for a 0.3 per cent rise on the month. Anything
higher could spark fears of another Fed tightening in the next month or so,
although the figure may be distorted by bad weather last month.
Vichy era revisited
Paul Touvier, the 78-year-old former intelligence chief accused of
collaborating with the Nazis during the occupation of France, goes on trial
in Paris for crimes against humanity. He is charged with passing seven Jews
to the Gestapo. Touvier is the first Frenchman who held high office in the
Vichy government to be tried.
Saleroom
Charles Rennie Mackintosh is today hailed as a master of 20th century
design, but 40 years ago the Glasgow architect, craftsman, and artist was
out of fashion, and Thomas Howarth was able to accumulate his furniture,
drawings and watercolours cheaply.
Howarth's collection comes under the hammer at Christie's in London today.
Estimated prices range from Pounds 200, through Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
40,000 for the high-back oak chair (illustrated left), up to Pounds 300,000
for a mahogany writing cabinet designed in 1904. The sale is likely to bring
in more than Pounds 1m.
18 FRIDAY
Yeltsin unfolds his plans
Russian president Boris Yeltsin's first state of the nation address to the
joint chambers of parliament is expected to reveal his position on economic
reforms after changes to the composition of his government.
Fiji national elections start on Friday, and continue for the following
week. The poll was called in November by Sitiveni Rabuka, the prime
minister, after his coalition government saw its 1994 budget defeated.
The election is likely to see Mr Rabuka's dominant Fiji Political Party come
under pressure from the breakaway Fijian Association. Led by deputy prime
minister, Josevata Kamikamita, it was formed by the dissident MPs who forced
the budget's defeat.
UK money supply
After a long spell in the doldrums, the growth of the broad M4 measure has
picked up sharply in recent months, giving further evidence of economic
recovery.
The annual rate is expected to rise in January to an annual rate of 5.7 per
cent, from December's 5.5 per cent, but still well within the government's
3-9 per cent monitoring range.
19-20 WEEKEND
Nato ultimatum on Bosnia
Nato has said that it will attack from midnight on Sunday any artillery not
under UN control within 20km of Sarajevo, the beleaguered capital of Bosnia.
It would be the first time Nato has fired a shot in anger in its history.
French miners' unions
French miners' unions plan a protest in Paris on Saturday at what they see
as a government decision to accelerate the run-down of the coal industry and
to promote nuclear power.
Ulster peace process
John Major and Albert Reynolds, the UK and Irish prime ministers, meet on
Saturday for the first time since December to discuss strategy ahead of Sinn
Fein's conference in Dublin on February 26 to 27. Mr Reynolds will be in
London for the England-Ireland rugby match.
Five Nations' Rugby
England play Ireland at Twickenham and Wales play France in Cardiff on
Saturday
Cricket
England start the first test against the West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica on
Saturday.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: CBOE revives the idea of options on OTC
shares - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outstanding performance of over-the-counter stocks last year has
prompted the Chicago Board Options Exchange to attempt a brave revival of an
idea that has twice failed - derivatives, in this case options, on an index
of the 100 most heavily capitalised companies traded on the Nasdaq stock
market.
Nasdaq, the OTC rival of the New York Stock Exchange, has grown steadily
over the past 10 years, with share volume rising to 66.5bn last year from
just 20bn in 1985. Once regarded as a mere upstart compared with organised
exchanges in the US, Nasdaq carved a niche by listing the shares of small
growth companies and trading them by wire and telephone.
Many of those companies, like Intel and Microsoft, are no longer small, but
retain their exclusive Nasdaq listings. Last year, Nasdaq matched the NYSE's
share volume, although dollar volume, at some Dollars 1,350bn, lagged the
big board's Dollars 2,830bn.
In the early 1980s, when portfolio managers first discovered that they could
use stock index futures and options to enhance investment returns, leverage
portfolios, or gain flexibility when allocating assets, Chicago's futures
and options exchanges launched a range of successful contracts based on
indices of NYSE-listed stocks.
However, when they extended the concept to derivatives on OTC stocks, they
failed miserably. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade spent millions of dollars launching competing OTC index futures in
1985 in a battle that ended only when it became clear they had misjudged
their market and no one was interested in trading either product.
They beat an embarrassed retreat, leaving the idea to the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, whose options on an index of 100 OTC stocks rarely trade.
Now, the Chicago Board Options Exchange is trying again. Mr William
Floersch, the exchange's vice chairman, says times have changed, and growth
companies are in vogue. Last year, he notes, Nasdaq 100 stocks outperformed
more heavily capitalised indices like the S&amp;P 500.
'The Nasdaq market is six time bigger than it was in 1985. We've seen an
institutionalisation of Nasdaq stocks,' he says. 'The Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange had a good idea, but they were a little
ahead of themselves.'
While there is no doubt the Nasdaq 100 stocks, with a market capitalisation
of Dollars 269bn, are popular with retail and institutional investors,
equities traders say the CBOE's Nasdaq 100 index option is like a one-legged
stool. It needs a complementary futures contract and a mechanism for
executing basket or 'programme' trades in the underlying shares.
Institutional money managers need all three to carry out balanced hedging
and arbitrage programmes. The CBOE's S&amp;P 100 index options are arguably the
most successful equity index product in the world because they are used in
conjunction with the CME's S&amp;P 500 index futures and the NYSE's automated
order routing system, known as the DOT.
A trader can buy an S&amp;P index option contract, lay off the risk by selling a
futures contract, and also purchase or sell a basket of the underlying
stocks, all in the same instant.
In the Nasdaq market this capability is lacking, but may develop in time to
boost the CBOE's new product.
As for a Nasdaq 100 futures contract, CME spokesman Andy Yemma says his
exchange is considering giving the product another shot. 'The CBOE is doing
the options, and we co-operate with them on a lot of other equity products,'
he says.

FRANKFURT
The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but UBS says the D-Mark's recent
under-performance suggests the markets may have to wait until March for the
next rate cut. Schering, the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, holds
its annual press conference today.
PARIS
The results of the public offer for Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, will be
announced after the bourse closes today, along with the offer price for
institutions, which the economics minister has suggested could exceed FFr405
a share. Estimates suggest the public offer was at least 2.5 times
subscribed.
A raft of corporate results are due during the week. Rhone-Poulenc, the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, which was privatised
at the end of last year, reports on Wednesday, Cie Bancaire on Thursday and
Primagaz, the bottled gas distributor, on Friday.
MILAN
Italy's privatisation extravaganza continues this week with a series of
roadshows to drum up interest in the sale of 57 per cent of Banca
Commerciale Italiana. A total of 260m shares will be offered to Italian
retail buyers and 240m to institutional investors when the privatisation
begins on February 28.
Of those on offer to institutions, 60m will be targeted at Italy, 50m at the
US and 130m at the rest of the world. BCI will be officially priced on
February 26.
ZURICH
Pharma Vision, the investment company specialising in pharmaceutical share
holdings, unveils 1993 results at a press conference tomorrow. Saurer, the
textile machinery and technology group, is expected to report sharply higher
full-year net profits on Wednesday.
TOKYO
The listing of the Nikkei 300 futures on the Osaka Stock Exchange may prompt
active index-linked trading. Buying by overseas investors, which has
supported prices during the past few weeks, may ease some of the volatility
created by futures linked trading, but in the absence of such purchases,
profit-taking ahead of the March year-end book closing by corporate
investors could depress share prices.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Nerves frayed as storm clouds gather -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the time the expected Wall Street hurricane had swept across the Atlantic
and reached a cowed London market last Monday, it was no bigger than a
sizeable squall. It caused havoc in the market that morning but there was no
real structural damage, apart from that to some frayed nerves on London's
trading desks.
But there are plenty of storm clouds gathering over the UK market, many
whipped up by unfortunate goings on in the Conservative Party.
The latest disaster, the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh,
means the government's majority in the House of Commons is now down to 15.
And the Tories face some big hurdles in the next few months. The most
important dates are May 5, which brings the UK local elections and June 9 -
12, which sees elections for the European parliament.
There are very real fears that the government will face crushing defeats in
both elections, putting even greater pressure on the prime minister's
tenancy at 10 Downing Street. Markets detest uncertainty and will not be
happy until the elections are out of the way.
As the stock market was absorbing the Wall Street-inspired slide caused by
the US interest rate rise, the Bank of England caught dealers on the hop
again by lopping  1/4 of a percentage point off its base rate ahead of an
optimistic quarterly report. After an initial sharp rise the market fell
back as strategists questioned whether there had been an element of
political influence in the move.
If the market has had to withstand some selling onslaughts of late, and
there were more of the same on Friday, there is still scope for further
damage this week, which sees the start of a two-week account and brings a
deluge of economic data from home and abroad. And the February reporting
season continues with numbers from such big names as British Airways, Hanson
and Glaxo.
Last week's results from two super-heavyweights, BT and BP, provided more
than a few crumbs of comfort; BT's figures were better than expected while
BP spiced its numbers with details of a big oil discovery west of the
Shetlands.
The US bond market remains the key to the UK equity market. If bonds
continue on their recent downward trend, strategists say, then UK gilts will
similarly come under pressure, dragging equities with them.
Despite the change of direction by leading UK indices this week, there is no
shortage of bullish commentators. NatWest Securities sticks with its view
that UK interest rates will be cut to 4.5 per cent by the middle of the
year. It is even more bullish on the market's second-line stocks,
forecasting an end-1994 FT-SE 250 level of 4,800.
In contrast, a most bullish observer of recent years, Mr Nick Knight of
Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, caused a stir at the end of last week.
Although maintaining his year-end FT-SE 100 forecast at 4,000, he said the
index could, in what is expected to be a turbulent year, drop to as low as
3,200.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Damming the flood of Indian issues - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's Ministry of Finance is imposing informal restrictions on Indian
companies which want to raise funds in the international capital markets, in
order to slow down the deluge of international equity and convertible bond
issues flooding onto the market.
Investment bankers and potential borrowers have been told that permission
for new issues will probably be restricted to companies which are either
heavily export-oriented, or involved in infrastructure projects - at least
in the period to the end of March.
In addition, ministry officials said they may introduce revised application
procedures to control the subsequent flow of new issues.
'We have over 120 applications for GDRs (global depositary receipts) and
euro-issues pending, and it would be sensible on anybody's part to examine
them more closely before granting permission,' admits Mr NK Singh, a senior
official in the Ministry of Finance.
'We are trying to orchestrate some sequencing, so that companies with strong
balance sheets and good track records are given preference over indifferent
ones. We also want to ensure that there is no bunching of issues - it is the
companies which stand to gain by this,' he added.
Last week the ministry gave permission for two big GDR issues - a Dollars
150m (Pounds 103m) offering for Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC),
and a Dollars 100m deal for the Mafatlal group, the Bombay-based textiles
and petrochemicals manufacturer.
With the liberalisation and deregulation of the Indian economy under Prime
Minister PV Narasimha Rao, Indian companies have enjoyed a new-found freedom
to raise funds abroad. Many are keen to do so in order to pay down domestic
debt - on which they commonly pay interest of some 18 to 19 per cent - or to
finance expansion of their existing operations.
Mr Roddy Sale of Jardine Fleming India Securities, points out that 'there
are about a hundred companies which want to do international equity
offerings: whereas in the domestic market they commonly have to issue
(shares) at a discount to the stock price, with an international equity
offering they can do it at a premium (to the underlying share price)'.
Barely a week goes by without one of India's bigger companies announcing a
new international equity or equity-linked offering.
So far this year, eight companies have tapped international investors for a
total of Dollars 860m with issues of GDRs or convertible bonds, according to
figures compiled by Euromoney Bondware. Issuers include names such as
Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), Great Eastern
Shipping, Indian Rayon &amp; Industries, and Videocon International.
Issuance so far this year has nearly reached the level seen in the whole of
1993 when new issues - from companies such as Reliance Industries, Sterlite
Industries, and Essar Gujarat - amounted to nearly Dollars 900m.
The ministry of finance is concerned that the flood of new international
equity offerings could have a detrimental effect on the Rupee's exchange
rate, triggered by the inflow of dollars. It does not want the Rupee to
appreciate against the dollar as this would make India's exporters less
competitive internationally. Mr David Maslin, economist at Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company, points out that the Reserve Bank of India has been buying
dollars to stabilise the Rupee over recent months.
More cynical observers of the Indian market point out that the ministry's
new 'slowdown' measures may help to smooth the path for the Dollars 500m
international share offering from Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the
government-owned overseas telecommunications network, due later this month.
The VSNL issue is critical to the government as 70 per cent of the funds
will be used to finance the department of telecom's expansion programme.
The government is particularly encouraged by the success of equity issues by
private Indian companies, and plans to raise money on the international
capital markets for many of the public sector companies.
However, it is concerned that indiscriminate borrowing could spoil the
conditions for subsequent issues, especially of government-owned
corporations that have embarked on privatisation programmes. Officials say
they are considering allowing up to three international issues every month
to ensure a steady inflow of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn a year.
Ministry officials said the government may also stipulate that proceeds from
international offering be used solely to finance capital expenditure or
repayments of high-cost borrowing or for working capital needs. In addition,
the ministry may impose a ceiling on borrowing.
Many of the international offerings by Indian companies have been hailed a
success by investment bankers and fund managers.
While the early, pioneering issues were launched at a discount to the
underlying share price, subsequent issues were launched at a premium and
performed relatively well thereafter. The heavy new supply has been snapped
up by specialist Indian funds - emerging market funds - as well as more
diversified funds, investment bankers say.
International investors who want to invest directly in the stock market have
to apply to be Foreign Institutional Investors. While the domestic market
route provides investors with a far wider array of stocks - there are about
7,000 companies listed on India's various exchanges - the settlement
procedures are cumbersome and subject to long delays.
Many investors prefer to take the international equity route: 'The advantage
of this is the liquidity - it is easier to accumulate and unwind positions,
and settlement is less of a worry,' says one US-based fund manager.
'GDRs are a good place to park your funds because the settlement is very
quick and there is potential premium expansion,' says Mr Tristan Clube, a
director of the Indian Opportunities Fund, launched last year by Martin
Currie Investment Management. Although the fund invests predominantly in the
domestic stock markets, it has bought shares in four or five of the recent
international equity offerings.
The success of these international issues reflects the huge amount of money
which has been invested in emerging markets generally. 'The success of these
issues is driven by asset allocaters and because most people can't invest
directly.' says Mr Clube.
However, some warn that if the tidal wave of new issues continues, the
market could suffer from 'investor fatigue'.
Mr Peter Bassett, head of emerging market investment at Henderson
Administration Group, a London-based fund management group, says: 'We are
delighted to see a new equity market open up, but we are having to be
selective now: I don't think the market is being well served by the glut of
issues because this is a new area and we need time to digest'.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strategy
The tightening of monetary policy by the US Fed was reflected in sharp
declines last Monday in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, but the Chinese
new year kept activity muted thereafter.
With today's reopening of the markets many analysts expect a further wobble,
but not necessarily another heavy sell-off. Traders expect a short-term
range in the Hang Seng index of between 10,000 and 12,500.
Mutual funds
Emerging market mutual funds based in industrialised countries held assets
of Dollars 79.6bn (Pounds 54.5bn) at the end of last year, according to new
figures from Micropal Emerging Market Fund Monitor.
Some Dollars 7.6bn of that was in emerging market debt funds. Of the equity
funds, some Dollars 20.5bn was in Asian regional funds and Dollars 17bn in
Asian single country funds, while only Dollars 5.1bn was in Latin American
regional funds and Dollars 3.9bn in single country funds.
Such figures may support the assertions of some analysts that Asian markets
are more vulnerable than Latin markets to shifts by mutual fund investors
because of interest rate rises in the US.
Pakistan
The country's three stock markets, in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, are
aiming to streamline their operations so that corporate results would become
available simultaneously.
A complaints centre will also be established to deal with problems of the
transfer of shares which, in some instances, can take at least 45 days.
Israel
The central bank plans to liberalise foreign currency trading rules as the
first step towards making the shekel convertible.
The authorities said that in a few months' time trading will become
continuous - at present the Bank of Israel publishes a representative
shekel/dollar rate once a day.

Markets page.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Shift in sentiment under way - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a weekend blizzard, the snow is piled high on Wall Street, but anxiety
is close to the surface. Analysts say any surprising political or economic
development could trip up the stocks this week and send share prices
tumbling again.
The risk is great, according to Ms Gail Dudack, an analyst at SG Warburg in
New York, because the market has grown so complacent. For investors
accustomed to bullish news, the only true surprises are negative ones. In
such an atmosphere, panic selling is easily triggered.
For this reason, Ms Dudack sees the Dow industrial falling to 3,600 in the
coming weeks, or about 10 per cent, from January 31's peak of 3,978.36.
'Underlying most stock market corrections is a shift in investor sentiment
from confidence to fear,' she says. 'Ironically, investors often feel most
comfortable at a point at which trends are about to change.'
She argues the events of the past fortnight leave little doubt that such a
shift is under way. The turning point was the 96-point battering two weeks
ago, set off by the Federal Reserve's tightening the Fed Funds rate to 3.25
per cent.
The plunge may have rattled investors, but did not drain their confidence.
When equities regained their stride early last week, there were sighs of
relief from Wall Street.
But the balloon, hastily reflated, was quickly burst. The trigger was
Thursday's appearance by Ms Elaine Garzarelli, a respected Lehman Brothers
analyst, on CNBC, a business news cable television. In mid-morning she
reiterated her view that a 4 - 7 per cent market correction would be
'normal' in the circumstances. Within half an hour, edginess in the market
had turned into a minor rout, with the Dow losing about 20 points.
Even though the bellwether Dow index finished 23 points ahead on the week,
'the vulnerability of the market is not going away', warned Mr Gregory Nie,
technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. 'We may try to trade a
little higher (today) but I expect the market to fall.'
He points out that the Dow utility average, which often presages downturns
in the broader market and parallels trends in interest rates, hit a 52-week
low last Thursday. 'If people choose to focus on that, it could be bad for
bonds as well as stocks.'
In addition, there are several potential triggers lurking on the political
and economic calendar. Investors could well react unfavourably to the
weekend talks between President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokowa, the
Japanese prime minister.
After last Friday's tame producer price data, the financial markets are
looking for the same in Thursday's consumer price report. The Commerce
Department's data on capacity utilisation - a keenly watched indicator of
inflationary pressure in the economy - may pose an obstacle as well. Sharp
rises in either figure would raise fears about the Fed bringing forward a
second rate increase.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Focus on yen after trade talks fail -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a week which sees a flood of UK economic data released and a Bundesbank
council meeting on Thursday, attention in foreign exchange markets will
initially focus on the aftermath of the failed trade talks between the US
and Japan.
President Clinton and Mr Hosokawa could not reach agreement at their Friday
meeting about how to cut Japan's trade surplus and improve US access to
specific market sectors.
The general expectation is that the yen will strengthen as this is one means
by which the US can close the gap. The market was already moving this way
last week. The yen closed on Friday in New York at Y107.1 to the dollar, its
highest close since mid-November.
Any appreciation of the yen is likely to be a short-term phenomenon. It does
not serve Japan's interests as it will hamper much-needed economic recovery.
Arguably, it could also cause the trade surplus to increase if it inhibits
growth in consumer demand.
In the longer term, economic fundamentals favour a stronger dollar as the US
economy is enjoying solid growth while Japan remains mired in recession.
President Clinton said on Saturday that the US will this week review its
options on how to approach the trade question. Reports in the US media
yesterday quoted senior US officials saying the administration had already
decided to try to increase its bargaining power by imposing sanctions on
some Japanese imports.
In the UK the focus will be on the release on Wednesday of retail sales
figures and the retail prices index for January. With the UK economy
enjoying solid growth, the outlook for sterling remains positive. Following
last week's poorly received rate cut, however, observers believe there may
be a delay before it recovers investor support.
In Europe attention will once more focus on Thursday's meeting of the
Bundesbank council. Although analysts have long been forecasting an easing
of policy, most believe the central bank will wait for January's money
supply figures before making any changes.

<TEXT>
After its bout of nerves for most of last week, the bond market will have
plenty of new economic data to feast on in the coming days, culminating in
January consumer price inflation figures on Thursday.
Judging by data released on Friday, though, investors will still have
trouble deciphering whether inflationary pressures are on the rise again.
Producer price inflation in January, at 0.2 per cent, was below many
estimates. After the upward drift in bond yields which followed the Fed's
move to tighten rates the week before, this came as a relief. The yield on
the benchmark 30-year bond fell back to 6.4 per cent by the end of Friday.
However, one component of the producer price numbers - a 0.6 per cent rise
in capital goods prices - prompted some concern.
This Tuesday will bring figures on the growth in industrial production in
January (generally expected at about 0.7 - 0.8 per cent, broadly in line
with the previous two months) pushing capacity utilisation up from
December's 82.8 per cent to over 83 per cent.
Consumer prices are expected to show a rise of around 0.4 per cent for
January (0.3 - 0.4 per cent excluding food and energy). That may be a bigger
advance than in recent months, but would still bring the year-on-year rate
down to 2.6 per cent.

FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo

<TEXT>
The breakdown of last Friday's trade talks between Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
Japanese prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, US president, may be good news
for the Japanese bond market.
The yen, which closed in Tokyo at Y108.25 on Thursday, jumped to Y106
against the dollar in New York following the failure of the US-Japan talks
on anticipation that US officials will support a stronger Japanese currency
to try and curb Japanese exports.
This may lead to lower Japanese interest rates, as the Bank of Japan will
want to avoid the negative impact of the higher yen on the stock market
ahead of the March book closing and will ease short-term money market rates.
With traders looking for excuses to buy bonds now that concerns of
over-supply from the income tax cut and economic stimulus package financing
are finally discounted into prices, the
market may be set for a mini-rally. The No 157 10-year benchmark, which
closed at 3.46 per cent last Thursday, may fall to 3.3 per cent.
Although some banks and corporate investors will continue to take profits on
their holdings to supplement their earnings ahead of the March year-end, the
outlook on the economy still looks gloomy and long-term bond yields may fall
along with short-term interest rates.

FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Strong backing for global concept -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Asian Development Bank's announcement last week that it intends to raise
one-quarter of its Dollars 2.8bn borrowing programme for fiscal 1994 through
its first offering of global bonds is a huge publicity coup for the
investment banks which have been actively promoting the global bond concept.
The ADB's endorsement of the global bond market is all the more significant
because of its close identification with the dragon bond market, which it
helped to set up more than three years ago in an effort to develop the
capital markets in Asia.
By their very nature, the dragon bond and global bond markets appear to be
mutually exclusive. Dragon bonds are targeted at non-Japanese investors in
Asia but global bonds are designed to be sold to investors across the world
at a single world price.
More importantly, perhaps, investors associate the global bond market with
liquidity and 24-hour trading, qualities which the dragon bond market has
not yet achieved since the issues to date have been relatively small and
infrequent.
But by deciding to go global, the ADB has effectively thrown its weight
behind those who believe the trend towards a global capital market is
irreversible and that over time, regional markets will become redundant.
Global bonds have come a long way since the World Bank launched the first
issue in 1989 as part of its successful drive to bring the yield spreads on
its bonds down to levels enjoyed by US federal agencies. Global bonds can
now be issued in a wide range of currencies and maturities and appear to
have retained their liquidity in the secondary market to a greater degree
than Eurobond issues of similar sizes.
Several sovereign issuers, notably Italy, have issued global bonds in order
to access the large pool of domestic investors in the US at about half the
cost of issuing bonds in the Yankee market - the US domestic bond market for
foreign issuers.
The reduction in fees has come about as a result of flexibility on the part
of the US Securities and Exchange Commission in order to encourage more
borrowers to make shelf registrations.
Borrowers now only have to pay fees on the bonds which have been sold into
the US and on the lead managers' estimates on what proportion of the whole
issue will flow back into the US.
'Many issuers now have to ask themselves why they are not issuing global
bonds,' says Mr David Karat, managing director at Salomon Brothers, one of
the earliest promoters of the global bond market.
Indeed, an increasing number of familiar names in the Eurobond market are
queueing to tap the global bond market. L-Bank, the recently re-named LKB
Baden-Wurttemberg, is about to embark on an international roadshow to gauge
investor interest in a global bond offering denominated either in dollars or
D-Marks.
Ms Gertraud Foos-Olsson, deputy director of L-Bank's international funding
division, says that, depending on market conditions, L-Bank could raise
Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn or the equivalent in D-Marks in the global bond
market by the second week in March.
'Our funding strategy is to offer investors big, liquid issues,' says Ms
Foos-Olsson. She adds that the global bond market makes sense for frequent
issuers - L-Bank intends to raise Dollars 10bn this year compared with
Dollars 6.7bn last year - since they can often get better pricing than in
the Eurobond market.
Officials at Salomon Brothers say the next stage in the global bond market's
development is to open up to a wider range of issuers, a move which has not
been welcomed by syndicate managers who would prefer to preserve the global
bond market's exclusivity. 'One would not want to bastardise the concept,'
says one syndicate manager.
Nevertheless, the successful global bond offering by Argentina late last
year has encouraged other emerging market issuers to take the plunge. Turkey
and Hungary have both announced their intention to tap the global bond
market in the near future. Indeed, investors might be more inclined to buy
paper issued by sub-investment grade credits if they are in the form of
liquid, global bonds because of the greater likelihood that trading in the
bonds will not dry up in the secondary market.
At the same time, there are moves to try to reduce the market's perceived
minimum size for a successful global bond offering from Dollars 1bn to
around Dollars 500m. This would enable issuers with smaller borrowing
requirements to take advantage of the lower funding costs offered by the
global bond market.

FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Gilts in for another bumpy ride -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's rate cut, rising US bond yields following the Fed's
unexpected tightening and talk of heavy overseas selling sent gilts tumbling
last week, and amid the cloudy international interest rate outlook and a
raft of UK data this week, the market is in for another bumpy ride.
'I expect gilts to remain volatile, with a downward bias,' predicts Mr John
Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. In the past week, gilt
yields rose by about 20 basis points across the curve, steepening to the
10-year area but flattening to the long end of the yield curve, he says.
Some feel the market's recent poor performance against its European
counterparts has largely run its course. Gilts dramatically underperformed
German bunds in recent weeks, with the 10-year yield gap over bunds rising
to nearly 90 basis points on Friday from 40 basis points on January 24.
'Gilts' underperformance shouldn't continue in any sustained way - spreads
have widened out enough to offer a reasonable risk premium,' said Mr Ifty
Islam, European economist at Merrill Lynch. But many still fear that the
Bank's  1/4 point cut on Tuesday may have dented investor confidence,
resulting in a higher risk premium for gilts.
It was the size and timing of the rate cut that puzzled investors, leading
many to wonder whether it had been politically rather than economically
inspired. Not only did it come during a difficult time for the government,
but it was followed on the same day by a Bank of England Inflation Report
which warned that the risks of a rise in underlying inflation were greater
than those of a fall. Some also felt that the small size of the cut
reflected a compromise between the Treasury, which wanted a larger cut, and
the Bank, which wanted none.
'The conclusion which is starting to be drawn is that the UK authorities may
be getting too relaxed on inflation,' says Mr Shepperd at Yamaichi.
However, others feel last week's doom and gloom has been overdone. Mr Roger
Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, argues that shares, gilts
and sterling, vulnerable after their December rally, were 'set for a fall,
more or less come what may'. In times like this, he argues, 'it is important
to keep eyes fixed on the fundamentals: rates are still set to fall in
France, Germany and the UK, and inflation is set to reach and sustain very
low levels'.
With inflation at the forefront of everyone's mind, Wednesday's publication
of the January retail price index will be keenly watched. The market
consensus is for the headline rate to have risen to 2.6 per cent from 1.9
per cent in December and for the rate ex-mortgages to have risen to 3 per
cent from 2.7 per cent.
'This month's RPI numbers won't help gilts, but as the inflation picture
improves over the months, gilts' yield premium should narrow back,' says Mr
Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers. 'Tactically, the rate
cut was messily presented, but inflation evidence will eventually show it
was justified.'
Some are less optimistic. Mr Julian Callow, international economist at
Kleinwort Benson, warns that real commodity prices may rise as global demand
picks up. Moreover, 'our expectation of a 10 per cent depreciation in
sterling/dollar this year will also place upwards pressure on UK import
prices', he says. Last, an increasing headline inflation rate, together with
a strengthening economy, suggests UK earnings growth could rise, he warned.
'This is likely to be treated especially badly by the gilt market, as a
precursor of higher inflation.'
Gilts have also been vulnerable to the weakness in US bonds after the Fed's
tightening. Investors have long judged the US experience as a guide for the
UK, and 'with the Fed now tightening, the perception is that the next market
to suffer in cyclical terms is the UK', says Mr Shepperd.
However, while the short-term outlook for gilts remains glum, many expect a
further rally, helped by a recovery in the bund market and several months of
stable core inflation in the UK.
'Although gilts are further ahead in the cycle than most other European bond
markets, we feel UK interest rates are likely to stay around current levels
or even fall a little further from here, and we see no great danger arising
from the inflation side at this stage,' says Mr Heinz Fesser, head of
fixed-income at DWS, the investment subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. 'We haven't
been sellers of gilts - actually, we bought some more on Friday to get in at
the current lower levels.'
A key test of overseas demand will come next week, when the Bank of England
auctions gilts in the 2000 - 2004 maturity range. Foreigners favour 10-year
maturities and given that this sector saw the biggest losses in recent
weeks, a 10-year auction 'could be a good opportunity for overseas investors
to switch back into gilts', says Merrill's Mr Islam.

A steep rise in yields on German bunds over the course of last week
reflected poor conditions in the US markets - yields on German government
securities rose from 5.63 to 5.71 per cent over the course of the week.
The trend is likely to be reversed only if the Bundesbank policy-making
council chooses this Thursday to deliver a long-awaited cut in short-term
interest rates.
The fundamentals support such a move - inflation is dropping and money
supply growth in January is likely to be back to manageable levels after the
embarrassingly high 8.1 per cent increase in the seasonally adjusted figure
for December. January data may be released this week.
Timing considerations alone suggest that this Thursday may be a good moment
to cut - it is unlikely that the Bundesbank will want to ease two weeks
later (when its changes to minimum reserve requirements take effect).
But the central bank is unlikely to want to ease monetary policy further
before an acceptable wage deal is reached in the engineering sector. Talks
between employers and the IG Metall union broke up on Friday night without
an agreement. A cut on Thursday would send the wrong signal.
The markets will thus pay close attention this week to developments on the
pay round.

Economic statistics are starting to behave like London buses. Nothing
significant appears for several days; and then three or four important
figures turn up at once.
The main traffic jam will be on Wednesday, when the gilts market can choose
from retail sales, unemployment, average earnings and the public sector
borrowing requirement.
But the key statistic for gilts investors will undoubtedly be January's
Retail Prices Index, also out on that day. The market was rather confused by
last week's quarter point base rate cut, which the Bank of England linked to
its Quarterly Inflation Report. However, the report's forecast of 3 per cent
underlying inflation in 1995 - in the upper part of the government's target
range - did not appear to justify the cut.
Both headline and underlying inflation are expected to rise, as a very good
January 1993 figure drops out of the annual comparison. But any figure
significantly above the 2.6 per cent consensus of headline RPI growth (3 per
cent for underlying inflation) is likely to dent confidence further.
The markets will also watch for further details of the next gilts auction.
The Bank of England announced on Friday that it would be offering stock with
a maturity range of between 2000 and 2004, rather longer than expected.

FT  14 FEB 94 / The Markets: Resting the case for the defence - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER

<TEXT>
In the United States it was the blue rinse widows who were accused of
pushing up stock prices in their flight from low short term interest rates.
In Britain we have the actuaries, who have an endearing habit of making
assumptions about present and future income flows which ignore the market's
view of capital value.
If employers are not to face vast increases in pension contributions, their
funds have to generate the kind of returns that keep the actuarial
profession happy. Trustees and fund managers are thus hungry for income and
are tempted to behave like blue rinse widows, chasing either high yields or
short term capital gains. Small wonder that commercial property is in vogue
for the first time in years.
The nervous gyrations in the securities markets since Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised US short term rates 10 days ago are
perfectly designed to encourage that interest.
A high yielding real asset with no stock market quotation has a strong
feelgood factor for insomniac fund managers when equity valuations are in
dangerous, low-yielding territory. Nor is it just that land, bricks and
mortar have defensive merit. As the chart demonstrates, property has not
looked so cheap relative to equities for years. Rents, which must over the
long run bear some relationship to the economic cycle, are at their lowest
level, in real terms, since the 1960s.
Property is the last haven of value in a mature bull market. It is the only
asset category where the yield looks high both by historical standards and
in relative terms. It also has a huge income advantage over gold and
commodities, which have been exercising such a powerful lure over the hedge
fund operators. And the property yield curve, the relationship between short
term interest rates and property yields, again provides bankers with a
powerful incentive to lend to property entrepreneurs.
For the first time since the 1960s it is possible for a developer to
contemplate putting up a building that will generate an immediate income
surplus over the cost of servicing a mortgage debenture. In the short run
that will put further downward pressure on yields, even if in the long run
it leads to an oversupply of space.
There are snags. For a start, rents are still falling. Modern leases no
longer run to 25 years as they did at the chart's starting point and the
property fraternity is waiting anxiously to see whether the government will
end upward-only rent reviews on leases. That would seriously reduce the
quality of the financially engineered income stream that property now
offers.
The illiquid nature of the asset provides a more fundamental reason for a
risk premium over gilts and equities, a premium which also has to reflect
the fact that the product cycle has shortened. Money has to be spent on
property at closer and closer intervals if it is to remain attractive to
potential tenants.
For Mr Norman Bowie, the former partner in Jones Lang Wootton who first
emphasised the importance of making full allowance for depreciation in
property valuation, this implies that stock selection, supported by research
on location, and the local or regional economy, is the sine qua non for
successful investment.
The trouble is that once people wake up to the merits of property it becomes
increasingly difficult to follow that advice. In the nature of things,
entrepreneurs find it easier than investment institutions. This is a very
imperfect market where the best opportunities tend to be made rather than
bought.
Some parts of the market already look over-excited, notably retail property,
where the fall in the yield on the Investors Chronicle Hillier Parker index
over the past year from 7.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent understates the
euphoria that has been apparent in some recent deals. Curious that retail
real estate should have performed so well when retail shares have so
dismally underperformed.
In today's very uncertain conditions in the retail sector, where the buyer
is unquestionably king and stands to become even more choosy after April's
tax increases, that looks unsustainable. I suspect that many property
investors' perceptions about retailing still reflect the merry days of the
1980s consumer boom. That was heavily influenced by a one-off change in the
personal sector's balance sheet and borrowing habits resulting from
financial deregulation. It will not be repeated in this half of the 1990s.
Dull, dull, dull
There are ways of riding the wave of enthusiasm for investment in
commodities without suffering the loss of income that comes from investing
directly in beans, bellies and white rhino hides.
Consider Hanson which reports next week. This was once a dull company with
lively, acquisitive management. Now it looks to some investors like a dull
company with a dull and ageing top management whose products are so dull
that they look appealing in a market where anything half exciting looks
horribly expensive.
Coal and basic industries sound a better formula at this stage of the cycle
than finance or retailing, especially when they come with recovery potential
as at Hanson, with the costs of the US coal strike out of the way and the UK
domestic economy on the mend. Disposals, notably that of Beazer Homes USA,
add another layer to the gloss. Divestments make more sense than
acquisitions in such an overheated market and at Hanson this well packaged
story comes with a yield attached of only marginally less than 5 per cent.
However it is still hard to buy the commodities story in an economic cycle
where the economies of the big industrialised countries are so
unsynchronised and there is so much deflation still going on in Japan and
continental Europe.
Growth in China and the dynamic Asian economies will ultimately make big
demands on energy and other raw materials markets, but the officials in
Beijing are trying to damp down the rip-roaring Chinese economy. And there
is something uncomfortably suspicious about a market in which highly
leveraged hedge fund operators succumb to an outbreak of serious
long-termism.
The convincing aspect at Hanson consists largely of that yield, which is
nearly 50 per cent more than the market average. But this is no time to be
snobbish about such things.
It is certainly not when so many other current analysts' favourites in dull,
old-fashioned British engineering are yielding less than Hanson and sport
multiples that are discounting rising earnings for as far as the eye can
see.
Take British Steel, where on some estimates the prospective 1995 price
earnings ratio is a little less than 20 and today's yield is 1.3 per cent.
No doubt the dividend will be raised as earnings recover. But that is, in
the analytical jargon, a forward looking rating, as are those at companies
like GKN and Lucas Industries.
Now turn to the unfashionable financial sector and compare those ratings
with General Accident, where the current yield is 5.1 per cent. There are
worries about where the insurance cycle will peak, but we do know that GA
does not cut the dividend.
If you think that the bull market is alive and well, and that last week's
dizzy spell was a mere blip, you will not be concerned. Remember, however,
that this is an economic cycle in which markets are playing a
disproportionate role in financial intermediation, whereby money is
channelled from savers and lenders to borrowers and spenders.
In the words of Mr Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research, the S&amp;P is the
American money supply. So if Mr Greenspan's monetary tightening in the US is
to work, and if Wall Street still exerts an influence on London, Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index, and indeed all the other relevant indices, have to undergo
a correction.
The case for the income defence rests.

FT  14 FEB 94 / The Markets: Wages, skills and inequality in a modern
economy - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute for Fiscal Studies is justly proud of its dual reputation for
providing sound economic analysis without even a hint of political bias. It
is much harder for the government to evade the charge that recent and
proposed tax changes are taking money from people with below-average incomes
and transferring it to above-average income households when it is the IFS
which makes the claim, as it did last week.
By choosing to look at the period 1985-95, the authors of the IFS report,
Christopher Giles and Paul Johnson, ensured their numbers could not be used
to make headline-grabbing claims about overall tax changes since the last
Labour government. The results were striking, nonetheless.
The combination of tax cuts in the late 1980s and the current package of tax
increases mean the poorest 10 per cent of households end up Pounds 156 a
year worse off. The top 10 per cent are Pounds 1627.60 a year better off.
Yet analysing the effects of tax changes on the distribution of income tells
only part, and a part which is reducing in significance, of the story of the
rapid growth in inequality over the past decade. For, as the left-hand chart
shows, changes in taxes and benefits have compounded a massive rise in gross
income inequality since the late 1970s.
Inequality is measured here by an index called the Gini coefficient. The
higher the figure, the more the distribution of income is skewed to a
smaller number of high income earners. Zero indicates a completely equal
distribution, one means that one person has the lot.
The main causes of this rise in pre-tax inequality are two-fold: long-term
unemployment and the growing dispersion in wages between high and low income
earners. Unemployment was much higher and more persistent in the 1980s than
in any previous decade since the 1930s, while the large majority of women
who entered employment did so from households with at least one other income
earner.
Meanwhile wage inequality has risen sharply, particularly for men. The wages
of the top 10 per cent of male earners have risen from 1.67 times the median
wage in 1979 to twice the median in 1993. Over the same period the wages of
the poorest paid 10 per cent have fallen from 68.5 per cent to 58.2 per cent
of the median.
UK wages are now more unequal than at any time since the 1880s when
comparable records began. Wage inequality has grown in almost every
developed country over the last twenty years. But wage inequality has grown
faster in Britain than in almost any other developed country, catching up
with France and overtaking Japan, as the chart confirms.
Allocating the growth in overall household income inequality among
unemployment, earnings and taxes and benefits is a tricky business. One
analysis conducted by Paul Johnson and Steven Webb of the IFS found that,
over the period 1979 to 1988, changes in taxes explained half the rise in
inequality. However another study by Stephen Jenkins of University College,
Swansea found a much greater role for wages and employment and a
consequently smaller role for tax changes.
However in whatever way the causes are allocated, the evidence suggests that
inequality among wage-earners is increasingly becoming the most important
cause of income inequality and poverty. This is certainly the case in the
US, where much of the best research on wage inequality has been performed.
And it is confirmed for the UK in an important paper by Paul Gregg and Steve
Machin, to be published next month by the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research in a new book on the UK labour market.
They find that the conventional link between poverty and its standard causes
 -average real wage growth, unemployment and inflation - broke down in the
1980s, as it also did in the US. The combination of low inflation, falling
unemployment and rising real wages would normally have delivered a
substantial fall in the percentage of the population in poverty, defined as
being below half the median of the 1979 level of real expenditure.
However the rapid growth of wage inequality which occurred throughout this
period has delivered the opposite result. The percentage of the population
with poverty-level expenditure continued to grow to more than a fifth of the
population by the end of the decade.
The causes of this persistent unemployment and rising wage inequality have
the same root cause, both in the UK and in the US, the rise in the economic
return to skilled labour and the declining demand for the capabilities of
unskilled workers.
The wages which skilled workers can demand has risen over the past fifteen
years, despite an increase in the supply of highly educated workers. The
proportion of workers with degrees rose from 8 per cent to 11 per cent
across the 1980s. However, while the percentage of workers with no
qualifications fell from 46 per cent to 32 per cent, the male unemployment
rate among this group rose from 6.5 per cent in the 1970s to 16.4 per cent
by the end of the 1980s.
Moreover, Gregg and Machin confirm that the same technological changes which
have produced this shift in demand from unskilled to skilled workers in the
US have also been at work in the UK. While lower-paid service sector jobs
have been replacing manufacturing jobs, both wage differentials and
employment shares within manufacturing and within particular industries have
shifted in favour of non-manual, better educated workers.
In short, the growing gap in incomes and job-chances between people with the
skills demanded by today's employers and workers with no qualifications is
the main cause of poverty and inequality in Britain and across the
developed, world.
Addressing this reality is the political challenge if the 1990s. Fiddling
with the tax system cannot, alone, do the trick.

FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Samsung Heavy weighs up its
future in cars - A look at the prospects for the big South Korean group's
latest controversial ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent listing of Samsung Heavy Industries on the Seoul bourse reflects
one of the company's chief but controversial ambitions - to break into the
car industry.
SHI, while expanding its main shipbuilding business, is determined to become
a carmaker. Its initial share offering, 10 times oversubscribed, will raise
Won150bn (Dollars 185m) for new motor vehicle and shipbuilding facilities.
SHI's carmaking ambitions, however, have met with opposition from both
industry and the government, which has still to give the go-ahead for the
company's plans.
And analysts have warned that SHI could face tough times as it tries to
expand in two of South Korea's most competitive industries, both of which
face overcapacity.
Samsung, however, believes SHI may become as important a mainstay for the
conglomerate as the highly-successful Samsung Electronics, which has sales
of Won8,050bn. SHI accounted for only Won1,900bn of the group's total sales
of Won50,000bn last year.
The Samsung business group recently selected SHI as one of its five core
companies under the government programme to encourage the nation's
conglomerates to specialise in a few industries.
SHI's strength rests on being Korea's third-largest shipbuilder, behind
Hyundai Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Machinery. It is
also a manufacturer of machinery and construction equipment, which accounts
for two thirds of its turnover.
It has become increasingly profitable, with estimated earnings of Won82bn in
1993, as Korea overtook Japan last year as the world's leading shipbuilder
in terms of new orders. This reflected the depreciation of the Korean won
against the strong Japanese yen.
SHI last year received total orders of 1.98m gross tonnes for 32 ships,
creating a backlog that will keep it busy for at least two years.
However, the rush of orders also created problems. SHI has been banned from
building or expanding shipyard facilities since 1989, when the government
reacted to a downturn in orders by imposing restrictions on the industry to
curb excess capacity.
SHI complained that its limited facilities prevented it from meeting
delivery dates for new orders. It lobbied successfully for the government to
lift the ban this month.
Samsung plans to more than double its shipbuilding capacity of 450,000
tonnes to 1m tonnes by expanding its second dockyard at Koje and building a
third.
However, these expansion plans have triggered a race by its competitors to
increase capacity, which 'could eventually lead to a significant supply
glut', according to Mr Lee Keunmo, an analyst for Barings Securities in
Seoul.
SHI has also had to fight industry and government opposition to plans for
car production. Its competitors claim Korea can not support a fifth car
company, although the industry posted records in sales and exports last
year.
'Obviously, there is major opposition from existing manufacturers, citing
overlapping investment, waste of resources and excessive competition,' said
Mr Don Lee, motor analyst for BZW Securities in Seoul.
SHI's first step into the motor industry came in 1992, when it won
government approval to produce commercial trucks in co-operation with Nissan
Diesel of Japan.
A factory at Changwon, built for Won72bn, will begin operation by the end of
June, producing 4,800 construction trucks by 1997. SHI plans to build a
second, Won450bn plant at Taegu by 1996. This plant will manufacture 68,000
mid-sized trucks and buses by 2000, with forecast sales of Won800bn.
However, it is SHI's plans to move into car production that are causing the
problems. The government last year blocked a suspected hostile takeover
attempt by Samsung for Kia Motors, the country's second-largest carmaker.
SHI is negotiating for a joint venture or technical co-operation with
several foreign car companies, including Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor of
Japan, Volkswagen of Germany, and Volvo of Sweden.
Meanwhile, the government has yet to decide whether to grant SHI a licence
to make cars. A decision is expected by the end of April.

sales

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A number of France's largest industrial groups, including Bouygues, the
construction company, and Alcatel-Alsthom, the telecommunications concern,
have underlined the pressures on the French economy by reporting reduced
sales for last year.
Alcatel-Alsthom saw its overall sales fall by 3.4 per cent to FFr156.07bn
(Dollars 26.2bn) in 1993 from FFr161.68bn in 1992.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, had previously warned investors that
sales were likely to decline in 1993 and forecast a further reduction in
1994 due to the contraction in the company's European telecommunications
activities.
Mr Suard has also forecast static profits of around FFr7bn for the group in
1993 followed by a fall in profits during the current year reflecting the
increase in its investments.
Bouygues, the world's largest construction company, was also hit by a
slowdown in its European business. It reported a 4.8 per cent decline in
sales to FFr59.7bn for 1993 against FFr62.72bn in the previous year.
The group has previously predicted a fall in net profits for 1993 to around
FFr450m from FFr685m in 1992, mainly due to the downturn in the property
market.
Ciments Francais, the building materials company, was another casualty of
the construction industry's difficulties. The company, which was recently
involved in a scandal over off-balance sheet losses, saw sales fall by 9.7
per cent to FFr13.46bn in 1993 from FFr14.77bn in 1992.
The gloomy mood was reinforced by the announcement of a 3.5 per cent decline
in sales for Bollore Technologies, the diversified industrial concern that
has been hit by the difficulties of SDV, its shipping division.
Bollore, which fell into the red in 1992, has already warned of further
losses for last year when sales slipped by 3.5 per cent to FFr24.81bn from
FFr25.72bn in 1992.

FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting boosts Euroc
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euroc, the Swedish building materials group, lifted profits after financial
items to SKr235m (Dollars 29.1m) in 1993 from SKr145m a year earlier.
The company said that it had managed the 62 per cent increase in spite of a
downturn in its main markets, greater price competition, and costs linked to
capacity reduction measures.
Euroc said that it benefited from cost-cutting, higher productivity,
increased exports, and a better performance in many African markets.
However, the results were affected by a SKr120m charge linked to the
company's efforts to cut capacity. The group had continued to be hit by the
sharp downturn in construction activity in the Nordic region.
The company said that deliveries of its products to Sweden and Finland fell
by between 15 and 30 per cent.
To strengthen its position, the group agreed to buy two cement companies
from the Finnish groups Metra and Partek at the end of last year.

<TEXT>
The Mexican government will this week invite US and Canadian-based banks to
apply for licences to set up Mexican subsidiaries, according to Mr Pedro
Aspe, the finance minister.
The foreign banks granted licences would be the first to operate in Mexico,
except for Citibank, which manages a Mexican branch under special agreement.
The licences are expected to be given out in the second half of this year.
Mr Aspe said foreigners would be given 60 days to make their applications.
He expected that all those that applied, and met the necessary legal and
financial requirements, would be granted a licence.
The financial minister said the banks would make Mexico's financial system
more competitive. 'I think there is going to be a revolution, which is
exactly what I wanted,' he said.
Mexico agreed to open up its financial system under the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Under Nafta, US and Canadian-based banks are collectively
allowed up to 8 per cent of total banking capital this year, with the limit
gradually increasing until the year 2000, when it disappears. Individual
foreign banks are allowed up to 1.5 per cent of total capital this year.
Several large US banks - including JP Morgan, Bank of America, Manufacturers
Hanover, and Chemical Bank - are believed to have shown interest in opening
up Mexican subsidiaries. European and Asian banks, through their US and
Canadian subsidiaries, are also expected to seek licences.
Under Nafta, Mexico further agreed to open brokerages and the insurance
sector to US and Canadian-based companies. Foreign brokerages will initially
be limited to 10 per cent of the Mexican market.
Based on foreign banks' interest in coming to Mexico, Mr Aspe did not expect
that the 8 per cent of total assets for foreign banks would be a binding
limit. But he was setting the 60-day time period for applications so as not
to have to ration foreign banking licenses in the future.
JP Morgan has already sought approval from the US Federal Reserve to operate
a subsidiary in Mexico. Morgan, which has a large representative office in
Mexico, plans to apply for the maximum permitted capital per foreign bank.
It hopes to offer a broad range of commercial and investment banking
services through a bank and brokerage, according to a spokeswoman.
Mr Aspe said the government would run a balanced budget this year, as
planned. However, he said spending priorities had changed after the New Year
uprising in Chiapas, and money would be shifted from some programmes to
politically more important ones.
The finance ministry separately announced that it would sell some or all of
its remaining shares in three large banks; Bancomer, Serfin and
Prime-Internacional. If all government shares were sold, the sales could be
worth Dollars 2.4bn.
Mr Aspe said money from those and other privatisations would, as in the
past, be placed in the government's special contingency fund. It was still
not decided whether the money would be used to reduce debt or finance
increased social spending, the finance minister said.

Pacific Dunlop, the large diversified Australian industrial group, has
reported a 24.5 per cent increase in first-half profits after tax but before
abnormal items, to ADollars 150.5m (USDollars 107.8m), thanks to a strong
performance in most of its divisions.
Sales for the six months to end-December rose by 9.2 per cent to ADollars
3.5bn.
Abnormal items had no impact on the 1993 period but did dent profits
slightly in the previous year. After abnormal items, net profits increased
by 25.5 per cent. Earnings per share, at 14.4 cents, rose by 21 per cent.
Pacific, which is based in Melbourne, said the resurgence in the US car
industry had greatly helped its GNB Battery Technologies division.
The company's South Pacific Tyres business - a joint venture with Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber - also contributed strongly to results, as a result of
productivity gains and higher sales.
The clothing, footwear and sporting goods businesses benefited from the
upturn in Christmas trading.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air New Zealand has reported a 44.6 per cent rise in net profit to NZDollars
88.1m (USDollars 50.5m) for the six months to December 31. The directors
said they were satisfied as the result had occurred in 'far from buoyant'
domestic and international trading conditions.
They said the group had benefited from favourable fuel and interest costs
and tax offsets. 'The company is making solid progress to the kinds of
earnings levels expected of the business operating in the traditional risk
area of aviation,' the chair-man, Mr Bob Matthew, said.
Air New Zealand is 35 per cent owned by Brierley Investments, while Qantas
of Australia has 20 per cent and Japan Air Lines 5 per cent.
The managing director, Mr James McCrea, said the first half saw encouraging
growth in tourism. Total passengers carried on international routes rose by
9.3 per cent, reflecting the start of new services to South Korea in
November, additional Taiwan and Bangkok flights and new capacity on Pacific
and Australia to New Zealand routes.
Mr McCrea said the withdrawal of Continental Airlines from the Pacific in
late October coincided with an overall lift in demand on all the sectors it
had previously flown.
He said that the improvement in earnings in the first half of the year had
been driven almost entirely by growth in passenger numbers and higher load
factors. The company's international cargo operations were enjoying higher
tonnages helped by an improvement in the New Zealand economy.
The directors said that the second-half of the year had begun satisfactorily
but earnings would probably be lower than those of the first half.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dominick Hunter comes to market with Pounds
60m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dominick Hunter, an engineering group which claims to be a world leader in
filtration products, is expected to come to the market next month with an
estimated value of about Pounds 60m.
The group, based near Newcastle, has a dominant role in the UK compressed
air filter market, and exports more than 60 per cent of sales to 40
countries. Last year the company made operating profits of more than Pounds
4.7m on turnover of about Pounds 30m.
Founded in 1963, Dominick Hunter was acquired during the 1970s by Walter
Alexander, the Scottish-based conglomerate which was floated in 1976 and the
subject of a Pounds 43m management buy-out in 1990.
The buy-out team raised Pounds 12m from peripheral disposals and in 1992
sold the original Walter Alexander business, which makes bus bodies in
Falkirk, to its management for Pounds 7.4m.
In spite of the changes in ownership, senior management of Dominick Hunter
has remained largely the same with average service between 10 and 20 years.
The group employs about 550 people, mainly in the north-east of England,
although it has sales offices in the US, Europe, Japan and China.
Mr Brian Thompson, chairman, said the flotation would strengthen the group's
highly leveraged balance sheet and allow further expansion of the group's
manufacturing and sales operations.
About 75 per cent of the turnover is industrial products, which are used to
purify and dry compressed air and gases. The group also makes membranes and
filter cartridges for air sterilisation and liquid filtration, used in the
production of mineral waters, wines, spirits and pharmaceuticals.
Last month Dominick Hunter paid Pounds 1.7m for Nitrox, a manufacturer of
nitrogen generation equipment with annual sales of Pounds 1m, which it will
merge with its newly developed business in this area.
Mr Thomson said: 'At the high-efficiency end of the market in which we
operate we see continuing growth in demand and believe we are now well
placed to expand our markets, particularly overseas.'
Institutional investors, including Standard Life, Postel, Granville Private
Equity, NatWest Ventures and Dunedin, hold about 75 per cent of the group's
share capital, the executive management owns 15 per cent and the balance is
held by 85 individual shareholders.
The flotation, expected in mid-March, will be sponsored by Granville and
Company, with NatWest Wood Mackenzie acting as brokers.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Listing sought by Wellington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellington Holdings, a manufacturer of hydraulic seals and other rubber
products, is planning a stock market flotation next month which should value
it at up to Pounds 50m.
A Pounds 22m buy-out from Evered in 1989, Wellington is currently wholly
owned by First Britannia, a venture capital fund, which will see its stake
diluted to about 40 per cent after the flotation. A group of 24 managers
will hold about 10 per cent.
The company has a complex history dating back to the early 1980s when Tarmac
bought a number of rubber businesses. These were sold to Evered in 1985.
Evered added Hallite, then a listed seals manufacturer, two years later.
Mr Brian Kent, the former chairman of Staveley Industries who has been
appointed Wellington's non-executive chairman, says the businesses and the
senior management have been largely unaffected by the ownership changes.
The company has three legs: Hallite seals, which are used in a wide range
hydraulic equipment; the rubber compounding division, supplying raw
materials for remould tyres; and the conversion arm, which makes finished
rubber products for the automotive, construction and engineering industries.
The company has weathered the recession well. Sales of about Pounds 42m in
1993 were more than 18 per cent higher than two years earlier, while
operating profits have risen by almost a third to Pounds 4.1m.
Wellington will retain most of the Pounds 20m to be raised from the planned
share placing, which is being handled by Kleinwort Benson Securities.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Clinical Computing to float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinical Computing, a west London-based company which develops specialist
computer software for the healthcare industry, is coming to market via a
placing of 4.05m shares with institutional shareholders which is expected to
value the group at about Pounds 20m.
The company was set up in 1979 by Mr Michael Gordon, the executive chairman,
and two Charing Cross Hospital Medical School colleagues. During the
late-1980s it developed the Proton suite of generic software packages which
help doctors and other healthcare workers record, store, manage and analyse
clinical information.
'Proton is designed to help doctors and other medical staff look after
patients,' says Mr Gordon, who will retain a stake of about 30 per cent in
the company following the flotation.
The software, which can be customised by clients, enables the large volumes
of data generated during patient treatment to be stored and retrieved
electronically instead of on mountains of paper. For example, each of the 70
dialysis centres in the UK treats about 350 patients three times a week and
generates about 3.6m treatment notes each year.
Clinical Computing has 600 systems installed in the UK, the US and eight
other countries, and claims to have no significant competitors in the
clinical market. The majority of installations to date have been in dialysis
centres, however, Proton systems have been installed for use in 19 other
clinical disciplines including diabetic care and obstetrics.
Last year the company posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m on turnover of
Pounds 2.6m.
The placing will raise about Pounds 3m net of expenses, which will mainly be
used to accelerate product development and expand sales and marketing
activities.
The pathfinder prospectus is due to be issued today and trading in the new
shares is expected to begin on February 17.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Commercial property in favour - Survey of
UK fund managers shows sharpened appetite for Japanese equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK institutions are showing renewed enthusiasm for commercial property,
according to a survey of fund managers carried out by Gallup for Smith New
Court, the securities house.
The February survey found that a balance of 33 per cent of fund managers
wished to buy property, repeating last October's figure which was the
highest level recor-ded since the survey began.
Fund managers also reported a sharpened appetite for Japanese shares.
The balance of managers planning to increase their holdings of Japanese
equities has risen from 8 per cent in December and 39 per cent in January to
50 per cent in February, its highest level since October 1991.
For the first time since the survey began in mid-1990, fund managers planned
to increase their holdings of cash.
Mr Peter Lyon, global stra-tegist of Smith New Court Securities, said that
the increased cash alloca-tions reflected the historic-ally high prices of
many stock markets and diminishing prospects for further interest rates
cuts.
The survey revealed a shift in interest away from continental Europe and the
Pacific Fringe markets.
Mr Lyon attributed the negative sentiment towards continental European
equities to continuing poor economic conditions and the slow pace of
reduction of interest rates.
The decline in interest in the Pacific Fringe markets was attributed to the
impact of US interest rate policy and to expectations that the strong
performance last year might be followed by a correction.
A balance of 12 per cent of respondents intended to increase their holdings
of US equities, while a balance of 4 per cent of managers planned to raise
their holdings of UK equities.
Investors continued to be confident about the outlook for the UK economy. UK
earnings per share growth is expected to decelerate slightly from 15 per
cent in 1994 to 13 per cent 1995, while dividend per share growth is
expected to be about 6.5 per cent in both years.
The survey involved 91 institutions, handling funds totalling Pounds 781bn.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Retail expansion for ICL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer company, is collaborating with Norweb, the
electricity distributor for the north-west of England, to establish a chain
of at least 20 computer superstores under the Icon brand.
The pilot superstore will open in Snipes Retail Park, Ashton-under-Lyne,
Manchester, on March 17. ICL is involved through Technology, a wholly owned
subsidiary and one of the UK's largest personal computer distributors.
The move has the backing of Technology's suppliers. The stores will sell
hardware and software from IBM, Compaq, ICL, Apple and Toshiba among others.
IBM, which recently agreed to resupply Technology with its products after a
row about its acquisition by ICL, said it expected to sell its home
computers and portables through the stores.
Mr Steve Sowery, director of retail operations for Technology, said the move
would enable the company to exploit fully the emerging market for small
office and home office systems.
More than 40 per cent of pc sales are expec-ted to go through retail outlets
by 1995, according to Romtec the marketing consultancy.
Norweb is the most aggressively expansionist of the 12 regional electricity
companies in retail operations. Mr Duncan Gray, the company's strategic
planning controller, said the venture would seek synergy between Norweb's
retailing expertise and Technology's computing know-how.
ICL, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a holding of a little more than 80 per
cent, moved into personal computers through the purchase of Nokia Data
Systems of Finland and into volume products through the acquisition of
Technology.
The company's first stake in retailing came through its acquisition of the
20,000 sq ft Icon computer superstore near Dudley in the West Midlands in
July last year. ICL said that the store had closed after only seven weeks
when its backers pulled out, but was now trading profitably.
Technology expects to generate about Pounds 1.5m in revenues per store in
the first year.
The development with Norweb continues ICL's efforts to find ways to improve
its margins faced with continuing decline in the price of personal computers
and software.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Viacom favourite as Paramount bid draws to a close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the US cable television group, last night looked the clear favourite
to win the Dollars 10bn battle for control of Paramount Communications,
which formally comes to a close tonight.
QVC Network, the rival bidder in the five-month struggle, said yesterday
that it would not raise its own bid further.
Since investors last week expressed a clear preference for Viacom's offer,
it seemed likely that Sumner Redstone's cable television group would come
out in front.
It remained unclear, though, whether Viacom would be able to muster enough
support to declare an outright victory by tonight. If it does not speak for
at least 50.1 per cent of Paramount's shares, then the formal biddingprocess
for the group will end and the battle will collapse into a free-for-all.
QVC's statement yesterday that it would not offer more for Paramount came
after hints last week that it might change the terms of its bid. 'We said we
would not bid above the prudent value for the company, and we haven't,' it
said.
But QVC added it believed it would be a better owner of Paramount than
Viacom, and it continued to question some aspects of Viacom's bid.
Viacom's B shares dropped by 4 per cent in New York on Friday, signalling a
clear belief that it will come out on top in the five-month battle.
Investors fear that whichever company is the victor will be weighed down
financially by the takeover.
The price of Viacom's B shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 5/8 on
Friday in a trading session which was shortened by an early stock market
close due to bad weather. The shares have now almost halved in value since
last September, when Sumner Redstone's cable TV group first bid for
Paramount.
While both offers for Paramount are worth around Dollars 10bn, Viacom has
won Wall Street's support with a higher cash component in its bid, along
with guarantees for Paramount shareholders should its own share price fall
in the year after a takeover.
At five months and two days, the Paramount bid war is now two days short of
the record five-month, four-day takeover of computer company NCR in 1991,
the longest takeover fight in recent Wall Street history.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Eyes on Japan as markets shiver
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Global bond and equity markets are gearing up for another nervous week, with
US-Japanese trade frictions provoking the latest jitters.
Following the failure of trade talks in Washington on Friday, many fear that
the US will try to push the yen higher as a way to close the trade gap.
'Tokyo is the place to watch,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global
currency research at UBS.
A higher yen could hamper recovery and have a severe impact on the Tokyo
stock market, which could drag other markets lower.
Early today in Tokyo, the dollar opened at Y106.15 - its lowest level since
mid-November - compared with Y107.1 at the end of New York trading on
Friday. Japanese equities fell sharply, with the Nikkei average down some
400 points at about 19,600 after an hour's trading.
European markets will once again be in the thrall of the Bundesbank, whose
council meets on Thursday. The central bank may be reluctant to ease
monetary policy ahead of a wage agreement in the engineering sector.
Unchanged German interest rates could put renewed pressure on other European
markets.
Faced with a slew of economic data, the UK markets are in for a nervous
week, although the worst may be over after last week's sell-off.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Board unlikely to approve CDollars
2.8bn bid - Maclean Hunter/Rogers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and broadcast group,
will meet this week to consider its response to a takeover bid worth at
least CDollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.42bn) from Rogers Communications of Toronto.
Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable TV distributor, ended two weeks of
speculation last Friday by offering CDollars 17 per share, plus a portion of
the proceeds from the sale of MH's US cable TV franchises if they realise
more than CDollars 1.5bn after expenses. Rogers has already bought an 8.3
per cent stake in MH on the open market.
MH is unlikely to give its unqualified approval. Expectations that the
Rogers offer is not the last word were reflected in a 38 per cent rise in
MH's share price last Friday to CDollars 17.38. But Mr Ted Rogers, Rogers'
chief executive, has insisted the bid will not be raised.
The alternatives being explored by MH include alliances with other
companies, a recapitalisation and the sale of its Canadian cable TV
business.
Among the uncertainties facing Rogers is whether the MH board will allow the
bid. MH's shareholder rights plan makes a takeover all but impossible unless
it is permitted by the board.
Mr Rogers claims the merger is needed to create a Canadian multi-media group
powerful enough to stand up to big foreign predators and the domestic
telephone industry.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Why yield has become the main
attraction - Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo's half-year figures on Thursday kick off the UK's pharmaceuticals
sector results season. With SmithKline Beecham the following week, and
Wellcome and Zeneca in March, analysts will be examining the sector's
fortunes in an unfamiliar light: that of the yield.
Through the 1980s and early 1990s, the drugs sector was the darling of the
capital growth investors. But in the last year or two, the threat of
cost-cutting in government healthcare budgets around the world has stopped
capital growth in its tracks. And as world interest rates began to slide,
the yield on drug sector stocks turned from virtually irrelevant to the
raison d'investissement.
In Glaxo's case, this means that all eyes will turn first to the proposed
dividend and only second to pre-tax profits. The range of City forecasts for
the dividend is from 8p a share to well over 9p, compared with last year's
7p interim.
Even a rise at the lower end of the scale would be a powerful reminder that
a yield of almost 5 per cent from a cash-generative high-tech world leader
compares favourably with a FT-SE 100 yielding less than 3.5 per cent.
With pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 970m, against Pounds 819m, the slower
growth follows falling interest returns from the company's cash pile and
gradually tightening profit margins as healthcare reforms have begun to
bite.
Among individual products, sales growth of the ulcer treatment Zantac, the
world's best-selling drug, is likely to have slowed. But the performance may
seem better five days later when SmithKline Beecham should reveal 1993 sales
of rival drug Tagamet virtually unchanged, depending on exchange rate
factors. Tagamet loses its US patent in May. Both are suffering from the
strong performance of a newer drug Losec, from Astra of Sweden.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Riding the theme park rollercoaster: Tibigardens hopes to
avoid and exploit EuroDisneyland's difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Euro Disney faces meetings with creditor banks, a rival leisure group is
putting the final financial touches to a Pta41bn (Pounds 200m) project. It
plans to open the biggest theme park in Europe after EuroDisneyland, outside
Salou, near Tarragona, on Spain's Mediterranean coast.
Grand Peninsula, which owns the theme park site, called Tibigardens, was
created in 1988 by Busch Entertainment Corporation, the leisure arm of
Annheuser Busch, the US beer and food giant which also operates US theme
parks.
Since then it has been joined by two large Spanish shareholders. The British
Tussauds group - part of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times  - is
negotiating to become the largest shareholder as well as the park's manager.
A final round of meetings began last week between Grand Peninsula and ICO,
Spain's official credit institute, to obtain a Pta15bn borrowing facility.
Afterwards, Grand Tibidabo, the Barcelona holding group which has 70 per
cent of Grand Peninsula's equity, will sell 30 per cent of the equity to
Tussauds, place 20 per cent with a Spanish investor and retain 20 per cent.
The theme park's other shareholders are Busch Entertainment, with a 20 per
cent stake, and Fecsa, a Barcelona-based electrical utility.
Tibigardens is being monitored with interest by leisure industry analysts.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, of Morgan Stanley in London, said: 'Just
because Euro Disney has got problems, it doesn't mean that major theme parks
in Europe are bound to fail.'
Comparisons between Euro Disney and Tibigardens are 'difficult because they
are on a different scale', says Mr Ray Barret, a Tussauds director. The
Paris park attracts 11m visitors a year, while Tibigardens expects 2.7
million in its first year. Even Tibigardens' highest ambitions are well
short of Euro Disney's. It hopes attendance will rise to 3.5m a year, and
eventually 5m after expansion.
But the chief difference between the two parks should be financial. Mr Ole
Bredberg, managing partner of Axel group, the Madrid investment bank which
has advised Grand Peninsula, says Tibigardens will be profitable from the
beginning. This forecast owes a great deal to what has been learnt from the
Paris venture's problems. Mr Bredberg explained: 'We have put together the
profitable end of Euro Disney.'
The main differences between the two are:
Tibigardens is just a theme park. It has avoided high fixed costs by
shelving plans to build a large beach side hotel and 2,000 living units. Mr
Barret said: 'Euro Disney got its theme park right and what went wrong was
its inability to fill its (six) hotels.'
Tibigardens is in a resort area, including Benidorm, where it does not need
to build hotels. There are some 800,000 hotel beds within 200km. The park is
aimed at holidaymakers who will visit the attractions - ranging from Mexican
villages to Polynesian islands - for a day trip.
EuroDisneyland is open all year, rain or shine. Tibigardens will only open
for 156 days between April and October and the climate is warmer and sunnier
than Paris. During this period more than 15m foreign tourists are within
striking distance of the park.
The financial structure differs markedly from Euro Disney's. According to
the Axel group's valuations, total fees in royalties and management payable
by Euro Disney to Walt Disney stood at 31.5 per cent of operating income
when the Paris park opened in 1992 and are supposed to rise.
Fees paid to Busch Entertainment for the design of the park and to Tussauds
for its management will fall from 12.4 per cent of operating income when the
park opens next year to 10.4 per cent in 1998 and will decrease further.
With the financing in place, the park should open in April next year, that
is as long as the construction of the magic mountain proceeds as planned.

FT  14 FEB 94 / BAe shareholders weigh up old guard's power: Tony Jackson
assesses whether replacing Cahill by Bauman will produce the managerial
chemistry the company has been groping for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace's shareholders might be forgiven for feeling slightly
restive this morning. The weekend press told them of the ousting of their
chairman, Mr John Cahill, and the appointment of a part-time non-executive
chairman, Mr Bob Bauman.
Mr Cahill's original task was to impose controls on a group which was by
general consent a financial and organisational shambles. Now that the BAe
culture has rejected him, the old guard are by implication back in control.
Given the hash they made of BAe in the old days, is that something
shareholders should be happy about?
The question is one which BAe might perhaps argue under two headings. First,
it might claim, the old guard is no more. The group's nadir came in
September 1991, with its Pounds 432m rescue rights issue. The executive
members of the board who sanctioned that issue - and who were responsible
for the plight which led to it - have mostly left or been removed. Professor
Sir Roland Smith, chairman, has gone; so have the finance, legal, personnel
and property directors.
True enough. But the chief executive Mr Dick Evans is still there, as is
deputy chairman Mr Sydney Gillibrand - a lifelong aircraft man, steeped in
BAe's defence and aerospace businesses. So are the operating chiefs of the
all-important defence business, who allegedly did not take kindly to Mr
Cahill's attempts to wean them from their old cost-plus ways.
But, BAe might argue, the new chairman Mr Bob Bauman is a formidable figure.
When, as newly arrived chairman of Beecham, he found himself at odds with
his chief executive Mr John Robb - now chief executive of Wellcome - it was
Mr Robb who left. Mr Bauman then piloted Beecham's merger with SmithKline,
making a fortune in salary and bonuses. He is now approaching retirement
with his reputation intact.
Unlike Mr Cahill, he genuinely appears to know about the defence and
aerospace business, having chaired the US group Avco from 1981 until its
takeover by Textron four years later. Although working only one or two days
a week, he will form a strong focus for any shareholder dissent.
He also has some strong non-executive directors, such as Sir Graham Day, Sir
James Blyth of Boots and Mr Ronnie Hampel of ICI. But they were all there at
the time of the rights issue debacle. On the face of it, this is genuinely
puzzling. Perhaps the twilight world of classified defence work is hard for
outsiders to get a grip on. But Sir James, for instance, was at one time a
senior official in the Ministry of Defence.
Perhaps the combination of Mr Bauman and Mr Evans will finally produce the
managerial chemistry which BAe has been groping for. Given its huge
importance as a UK manufacturer and employer, one certainly hopes so. If
not, roll on the much-touted merger with GEC. If Lord Weinstock, now 69,
could knock BAe into shape, he would not only round off his career but do
the nation a genuine service.

The first of the larger building contractors will announce annual results on
Thursday, for the year to October 31. The big question is by how much new
chief executive Mr Oliver Whitehead, ex-Babcock International, will write
down McAlpine's assets following the departure of Mr Graeme Odgers, who took
over as chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Pre-tax profits
should have benefited from the recovery in the UK and the US, and are
expected to be about Pounds 6m before write downs, against Pounds 3.6m.

Wickes introduced deep price cuts on 1,000 of its 3,500 products in its

Other companies

Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, reports first-quarter results on
Tuesday. A wide range of forecasts reflects many uncertainties: the cost of
the US coal strike; the severity of the negative swing on interest charges;
the contribution from Quantum Chemical, acquired at the end of the last
financial year; and the effect of exchange rates. Hopes are for a modest
underlying rise from last time's Pounds 216m, excluding Pounds 20m of
disposal profits. No increase in the quarterly dividend is expected,
although the chairman's statement should be fairly upbeat.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK squandering peace opportunity, says Adams: Hopes fade
that IRA will accept declaration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, yesterday accused Britain of
'squandering a unique opportunity for peace', adding to growing government
pessimism on the likelihood that the IRA and Sinn Fein will accept the
Downing Street declaration.
In remarks that dashed expectations of an early decision by the republican
movement on accepting the declaration as a basis for peace in Northern
Ireland, Mr Adams demanded changes in the British government's position.
He said that although Dublin had given some clarification of the
declaration, London had 'stalled, delayed and refused' to explain further a
document which he described as a 'masterpiece of ambiguity'. He claimed it
would be impossible for Sinn Fein to give a definitive response without more
information.
Both London and Dublin have repeatedly insisted that the IRA must end
violence before Sinn Fein can join talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
When they meet next weekend, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr
Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will be expected to declare their
determination to press on with the broad process of negotiations.
Giving no sign of any softening in Sinn Fein's stance, Mr Adams rejected
what he described as the unionist veto on constitutional changes in Northern
Ireland. He insisted that London would have to join the 'persuaders' in
seeking to convince unionists that their future lay 'with the rest of the
Irish people'.
Interviewed on ITV's Walden programme, in which Mr Adams's statements were
read by an actor, he called on ministers to go the extra mile for peace.
'Unless the British government says to the unionists: 'Your future rests
with the rest of the Irish people' - unless it makes that small step
forward, then that government cannot say it is interested in peace.'
He said republicans recognised that they needed the consent and full
participation of unionists in the process, but that they did not want the
British government 'sitting on its hands and blaming and using the
unionists'.
Mr Adams added: 'Let us not squander the opportunity for peace on the rock
of either a veto or on the British refusing to join the persuaders.'
Mr Adams said if the British government believed the joint declaration was a
basis for a political settlement, it should be prepared for further
discussion.
Downing Street said last night the government's position on the declaration
remained unchanged. It said it was 'deeds not words' that were important and
that all the IRA had to do if it wanted progress in Northern Ireland was to
abandon violence.

Russia has significantly softened its opposition to air strikes on Serb
positions in Bosnia a week before the United Nations deadline for withdrawal
of their artillery around Sarajevo expires.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said at the weekend that
Russia would agree to air strikes - but only 'as a last resort'. He said
they would have to be called for by UN forces on the ground and cleared
through the security council by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general.
Mr Kozyrev's remarks came after a telephone conversation between President
Boris Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton on Friday night, at which -
according to the Russian president's spokesman - the two had agreed to 'step
up work' with the opposing groups on whom they had most influence. Mr
Kozyrev himself talked by telephone on Saturday to Mr Warren Christopher,
the US secretary of state.
Mr Kozyrev, who had earlier refused to countenance air strikes under any
conditions, said on Saturday that he now viewed them as 'conceivable'.
Senior US officials emphasised yesterday what Mr William Perry, defence
secretary, described as the 'new energy' being devoted to diplomatic
negotiations. But Mr Perry conceded that negotiations might take 'months' to
come to fruition. Meanwhile, he said Nato was intent on 'raising the stakes'
for those who continued to shell Sarajevo after the deadline expires on
February 21. The solidarity of the alliance was also a prime consideration
in US policy, he added.
In a television interview, he said military options excluded the presence of
US ground troops but included intensified air strikes if shelling persisted.
Mr Perry did not rule out bombing Serbia itself, although he cautioned
against 'widening' the hostilities.
Mrs Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said in another interview
there would be 'no extension' of the ultimatum. She conceded that if a
settlement were reached, the US remained committed to providing peacekeeping
troops. But they would total less than half the 50,000 said to be needed to
police any settlement.
US embassy families left Belgrade for Budapest yesterday as a precaution
against reprisals. British embassy dependants left on Saturday and the
Germans are also recommending their embassy families to leave.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Spain's cash plea threatens EU enlargement talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Union's drive to complete enlargement negotiations with Sweden,
Finland, Austria and Norway by the end of the month risks being side-tracked
by a Spanish claim for extra money from the applicant countries.
Madrid says the four applicants are all likely net contributors to the EU
budget and that the resulting cash payments should go to the poorer member
states, including Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
The intervention has dismayed other EU states who fear a budget row might
sink the chance of meeting the March 1 deadline required for enlargement to
go ahead in January 1995.
The accession negotiations in Brussels are finely poised, with hard
bargaining taking place over regional aid and special assistance to Nordic
farmers. An internal budget row could wreck an early conclusion of the
talks.
Estimates of how much the Swedes, Finns, Austrians and Norwegians are likely
to contribute to the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn) budget are still
preliminary. Some figures suggest cash transfers might range between Ecu2bn
and Ecu4bn a year, depending on their economic output.
The UK and Germany are already restive about the amount of money the EU
sends to southern Europe. British estimates range from Ecu7m daily to Greece
and Portugal, and Ecu13m a day to Spain.
In December 1992, Spain withheld its support for early enlargement
negotiations until it won backing from its partners for a 'cohesion fund'
for special transfers to the EU budget from the rich north and centre to be
funnelled to the south.
Last week in Brussels, Spain indicated it would like its partners to agree
on the principle that all net contributions from applicant states should be
used to 'top up' the cohesion fund.
Some EU delegations were left with the impression that Spain wants an
agreement on the exact level of individual contributions from Nordic and
Alpine states. 'That would scupper any chance of meeting the March 1
deadline,' said one Brussels official.
A Spanish official declined to confirm or deny the country's position on the
applicant countries' net budget payments.
Spain has taken a consistently tough line in the enlargement negotiations,
partly because it is worried that the momentum toward European integration
is moving decisively northward.
Last year, Spain insisted that the applicants be left out of the Maastricht
treaty's mechanisms for setting up a single European currency. It still says
only the 12 should be considered eligible for European monetary union.

FT  14 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: French supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oddly for this stage in the cycle, French food retailers have been among the
strongest performing stocks on the Paris bourse. Defensive consumer
companies would normally lose ground as industrial companies promise the
greater recovery prospects. But food retailers should deliver robust
earnings gains themselves, despite tough trading conditions. International
investors, disillusioned with the UK grocery scene, have certainly been
tempted by what is on offer across the Channel.
The promise is that French grocers will be able to replicate the margin
expansion enjoyed by their UK counterparts in the 1980s. More efficient use
of computers, the centralisation of distribution functions and the
development of own-label products may enable retailers to double operating
margins. This trend should be hastened by the industry consolidation which
is already under way.
Stricter planning restrictions may choke off superstore developments while
leaving smaller discount chains more room to expand. But France already has
a high density of hypermarkets. The big retail chains should still boost
profits through productivity gains, even if actual turnover does not grow.
Besides, some sales will come from foreign markets as retailers diversify.
It is, of course, possible that UK grocers may consider themselves best able
to teach the French the productivity game. Tesco has already dipped its toe
in the water by acquiring Catteau. As the UK market tightens further, the
leading food retailers may well be tempted to take a bigger plunge. After
all, the English always were a nation of shopkeepers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no surprise that the Japanese government's modest pump priming package
and austere budget last week met with such a tepid reception both from the
US and from the stock market. The package's compromise on tax - where it
offers a single-year income tax cut instead of a permanent one - is a
consequence of the complexities of coalition government.
The budget shows the finance ministry's equally understandable wish to
squeeze recurrent spending when the long-term outlook for revenues is weak.
This only makes the need for another discount rate cut all the more urgent.
Real interest rates are high, now that the deflation in asset prices which
followed the collapse of the late 1980s bubble has taken root in consumer
prices. Most economists believe that, contrary to the incomplete picture
shown by the official figures, prices are falling by around 1 per cent
annually. This makes it more likely that Japan's gloomy consumers will save,
not spend, Mr Hosokawa's tax cut. Why buy today, when it is cheaper tomorrow
 -especially when wages will be under pressure in the spring pay bargaining
round?

While the chairman is the very public face of a company, it has been clear
for some time that Mr Cahill has not been the prime mover of events within
BAe. The limits to his time in the UK must have curbed his effectiveness,
while the wild goose chase for a regional jet deal in Taiwan absorbed much
of his concentration. Sadly, his contribution does not merit the kind of
payment he has, in the end, collected. But that was the contractual bind to
which BAe committed itself in its darkest hour. An expensive divorce
settlement is better than continued misery.
Judged on their results, the reforms introduced to BAe's ailing businesses
must be considered a success. The company has dealt with many of its worst
problems, such as regional jets and its turboprop leases, while creating
financial flexibility through new banking lines and the sale of corporate
jets and Rover. Those changes will bring out the underlying value of BAe's
businesses, and whatever the local turbulence, the share price recovery has
further to go.
The task now is to turn all this to the advantage of the defence business.
Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive, has proved himself as a salesman, but he
still has much to demonstrate as a manager. The presence of Mr Bob Bauman as
a heavyweight non-executive chairman should reassure the City that the
company has a ring-master capable of containing Mr Evans. Having had such a
poor track record with its chairmen, however, the company remains on
probation. It must demonstrate that there is not a defence mafia which
resists reform.

FT  14 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: A touch of cold steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
December's agreement to curb subsidies and rationalise the European steel
industry always looked brittle. The chances that the deal would break down
increased considerably after the rescue plan for Klockner-Werke's Bremen
plant went ahead. Though the European Commission has promised to take a
tough line on the Bremen arrangement, the political lobbies have plenty of
time to swing into action before it pronounces in July. The chances of the
Commission stopping the deal are probably slim, despite the involvement of
the Bremen state government. In those circumstances, the reluctance of
non-aided steel companies to come up with fresh offers to cut capacity at
tomorrow's meeting with the European Commission is perfectly understandable.
The politicians responsible for December's agreement have only themselves to
blame.
Still, against the backdrop of the industry's voluntary supply restraints
which lifted prices off their lows last year, a permanent cutback in
capacity is less urgent than the need to deal once and for all with
subsidies. Within 12 months or so, demand should be rising as European
economies turn upwards. At the peak of the cycle, the capacity surplus may
look markedly less than the 30m tonnes which is commonly estimated today.
More imports would be needed to meet supply shortfalls then if capacity is
cut back too zealously now.
Such thoughts may help to explain the continuing resilience in British
Steel's share price. With its low cost base, strong balance sheet and modest
capital spending requirements, British Steel is in a stronger position than
most private sector companies to ride out the storm, and even to develop
lucrative new markets in the Far East. It will still pay a heavy price,
though, if Europe fails to come to grips with subsidies that keep its
inefficient competitors alive.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Littlechild's power gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government's decision in the late 1980s to privatise the power
generation industry as a duopoly has been a costly error. Consumers have
been charged more for their electricity than they would have been in a more
competitive market. To free themselves from the generators' market power,
regional electricity companies made premature investments in gas-fired
plants. As a consequence, thousands of coal miners lost their jobs.
Last week's deal between Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
regulator, and National Power and PowerGen will do nothing to repair the
damage of the past. What it may do is make things better in the future. But
even that is far from certain.
The reason for some hope is that Prof Littlechild has focused on the heart
of the problem: the fact that National Power and PowerGen own virtually all
the country's coal and oil-fired plants. These have higher running costs
than the nuclear and gas-fired stations owned by competitors and so, under
the complex pool system, are the last to be brought on stream as demand
mounts. Control of this marginal plant effectively enables the duopoly to
fix prices not just in the pool, the wholesale spot market for electricity,
but also for longer-term contracts.
Under the deal with Prof Littlechild, National Power and PowerGen have
agreed over the next two years to sell 6,000MW of plant, equivalent to six
large stations. The hope is that the new owners of this capacity will bid
vigorously to keep prices low. In the interim, there will be a two-year
price cap, cutting pool prices by up to 7 per cent.
The price cap will benefit large industrial users, which often buy
electricity direct from the pool. Smaller companies and residential
customers, though, will get little immediate relief. Their prices are
largely determined by five-year contracts put in place at the beginning of
last year.
Not ideal
Although the prices in these contracts are even higher than pool prices,
Prof Littlechild decided not to revise the terms. This is largely because
the government brokered the contracts when it was trying to find a way out
of the 1992-93 coal crisis.
Prof Littlechild's resort to price control is not ideal. Price regulation
can make a market less flexible and competitive. However, in this instance,
it can be defended as a purely temporary measure while the divestment
process is completed.
The bigger question is whether the disposal of 6,000MW of plant or roughly
10 per cent of England's generating capacity will be enough to curb the
duopoly's market power. Prof Littlechild thinks it will. Once competition
from new gas stations, Nuclear Electric and imports from France and Scotland
is included, the duopoly's share of generating capacity will fall to under
50 per cent.
Too optimistic
However, it would be wrong to be too optimistic. Nuclear Electric, gas
stations and imported electricity may dent the duopoly's market power, but
not by much given that they do not own marginal plant. And, though the new
competitors created after the duopoly's divestments will be in a better
position to influence prices since they will probably own marginal plant, it
remains to be seen whether two minnows will be sufficient to restrain the
market power of companies many times their size.
Why, then, did Prof Littlechild not insist on a much more ambitious disposal
programme? That would have broken the duopoly's power for good.
The answer is almost certainly that to do so would have required a referral
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Not only would that have delayed
any benefit to consumers. Prof Littlechild, who must have been acutely aware
of ministers' recent refusal to back an MMC recommendation to break up
British Gas, could not have been sure of the outcome. An MMC referral would
also have postponed the government's plans to sell its remaining 40 per cent
stake in the generators.
There is something to be said for clinching a deal now rather than gambling
on a monopoly investigation. But Prof Littlechild has also gambled that the
sale of a handful of stations will be sufficient to curb the generators'
power. Customers can only hope his gamble pays off.

Long faces from Australia's political hacks. Prime minister Paul Keating
says his appearances in the daily parliamentary question time are to be
pared back to Mondays and Thursdays. A duty roster of ministers will
function on other days.
It's rather like having Hamlet without the prince. Few politicians pack a
verbal punch so well as Keating, and some of his pithier taunts against the
opposition - 'scumbags' and 'perfumed gigolos' are a couple of recent
examples - make great copy.
But apparently Keating craves a more statesman-like image. 'No man in our
history has done more to downgrade, abuse, sabotage, undermine, subvert and
threaten the processes and procedures of this parliament,' declared John
Hewson, the opposition leader, of Keating in the wake of his decision to
seek gravitas. With enemies like that who needs gravitas?

The Advertising Association has published a punchy pamphlet - Ads and Fags -

consumption. Rallied in support of continued cigarette advertising are
Bottomley: 'We should not ban the advertising of something it is legal to

The possibilities are legion. Inventive copywriters could, for instance,

Few company chairmen are brave enough to tell their biggest and most
powerful shareholder exactly what they think of them.
But Andre Rousselet, the septuagenarian chairman of Canal-Plus, the French
television group, joined the ranks of the courageous - or foolhardy - when
last week he handed in his resignation as a director of Havas, protesting
against its plans to re-shuffle its stake in Canal-Plus.
The resignation might seem a little rash; the deal in question will increase
rather than diminish Havas's influence over Canal-Plus. But Rousselet knows
he holds a few trump cards.
Not only has he a large personal stake in Canal-Plus; he also enjoys some of
the very best political connections, nurtured through years of strolling
around the immaculate greens of the posh Saint-Cloud golf club. There his
regular partner is none other than President Francois Mitterrand.

Top bosses of the 12 regional electricity companies are now looking at
profits of more than Pounds 10m on executive share options they received
three years ago. Nice work if you can get it.
But they claim the customer has also done well out of privatisation, thanks
to much improved services. That's open to question in the case of London
Electricity, where chairman John Wilson is looking at a paper profit of over
Pounds 500,000.
Callers to London Electricity's main switchboard yesterday heard an
automatic operator intone: 'Our emergency service is now in operation.'
Holding on for further details, the operator then suggested calling another
number because 'there is a telephone problem'. The new number referred the
customer on to two further numbers. Finally an answering machine said
emergency service telephones were busy: 'please call back in 15 minutes'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Syron has his work cut out at the American Stock Exchange, where he
took over as head at the end of last week. A distant third to the New York
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq markets, the Amex looks increasingly superfluous
in a world of automated trading. Syron, 50, admits the Amex has had an
unhappy few years: 'I don't think we've done as well as we need to do.'
The former head of the Federal Reserve in Boston has no detailed plans on
how to reverse matters, only a belief that the sort of auction market run by
the Amex serves investors better than the dealer markets which are
increasingly prominent in the US. Unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange
Commission has steadfastly refused to favour auction markets.
In five years at the Boston Fed Syron built a solid reputation as a tough,
astute operator. Fixing the Amex will need all his energy and political
skills - and then some.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Will they take the money and run?: As Names deliver their
responses to Lloyd's settlement offer, Richard Lapper answers outstanding
questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today is the deadline for Lloyd's Names to accept or reject the London
insurance market's Pounds 900m offer of compensation to meet claims of
Pounds 3.2bn stemming from recent losses.
Soon after 3pm, Lloyd's should know whether enough Names - the individuals
whose personal wealth supports the market - are prepared to accept the deal,
thus saving Lloyd's from years of complex, time-consuming and expensive
litigation, and restoring its badly tarnished reputation.
The offer, announced two months ago after more than a year of acrimonious
argument, allocates money to 22,921 loss makers according to their exposure
to 39 syndicates (groups of Names) in 67 separate years of account; their
perceived chances of success in the courts; and their determination to take
legal action. As the Names' response arrives today, several questions
remain:
Is the offer a good deal for Names?
For some. But hundreds of Names are so badly hit by their losses that even
if they accept the settlement they could still face bankruptcy. Names
introduced to Lloyd's by the Lime Street agency (one of dozens of companies
which handle Names' affairs), face average losses of more than Pounds 2m.
Even though they have been offered above-average levels of compensation, no
Lime Street Name stands to receive more than Pounds 800,000.
Other Names have been offered so little that they have virtually nothing to
lose by legal action. Most names on syndicates involved in long-tail
liability insurance - in which claims can emerge many years after the
inception of the policy - and whose legal cases were assessed as weak by the
Lloyd's panel which helped devise the settlement offer, have been offered
less than 10p for every Pounds 1 of loss.
But Names between these two extremes face a dilemma: 1,950 Feltrim Names,
for example, who are suing their agents for losses of Pounds 599m, stand to
receive Pounds 238m if they accept the offer, against Pounds 310m to Pounds
425m which they believe they could win through legal action.
The settlement can seem attractive if the uncertainties and costs of legal
action are taken into account. Although the panel regards the legal case of
the Feltrim Names as strong, the courts might not agree.
In addition, Names have to consider the fact that - once interest and
capital gains are included - money received now will be worth more by the
end of 1995, the earliest date by which any group of Names can expect a
court ruling.
Names must also consider a third - and potentially more important -
question. Even if their cases are successful in court, will the agents they
are suing for negligence have sufficient funds to meet claims?
Most of the responsibility for meeting successful legal actions will fall on
errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance policies, which cover the agents
against negligence awards. But these funds are limited. According to the
document which details terms of the offer, E&amp;O insurers have between Pounds
820m and Pounds 1,085m in cover.
Of their cover, E&amp;O insurers have agreed to contribute about Pounds 400m to
the settlement offer, supplemented by some Pounds 450m from the market's
central fund - which meets claims when Names cannot pay - and Pounds 50m
from the agents.
The danger for Names in rejecting the settlement is that they could find
themselves embarked on a 'dash for cash', with Names whose cases come to
court first - such as Gooda Walker and Feltrim Names - winning the lion's
share of available funds, leaving less money available to meet claims by
smaller groups. Names belonging to several loss-making syndicates and the
action groups organising their legal cases could find gains in one action
offset by the smaller amounts obtained in others.
Will Names accept?
Over the past few weeks, a growing number of names have agreed to accept the
deal but rejection still looks likely. Lloyd's is seeking a majority of at
least 70 per cent of Names by value of the offer: Names whose offers amount
to 70 per cent of Pounds 900m must accept the settlement for it to take
effect. In January all but one action group voted to turn down the deal.
Even when the level of compensation itself has been viewed as acceptable,
Names have objected to several other features of the offer, such as the
absence of protection against losses that have still to emerge on their
syndicates. Names accepting the settlement have to give up legal rights in
respect of the claims it covers and could find themselves legally
defenceless if Lloyd's seizes their assets and property to pay off debts.
However, many action group members did not participate in ballots on the
offer, and a substantial minority of Names remains outside any action
groups.
Although most Names belonging to action groups are legally bound by the
group's decisions in relation to the offer, some may choose to resign from
membership if they want to accept the deal and the group does not.
The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about half the market's
active membership, has warned Names of the uncertainties of legal action. Mr
Robert Saunders, of Smith &amp; Williamson, a private bank and accountancy firm
which advises about 500 Names, says he has detected a 'groundswell of
acceptances in the last few weeks'.
What will happen if Names say no?
They will be party to a string of long-running legal actions - beginning in
April when the Gooda Walker case comes to court. Feltrim and Merrett Names
have court dates set for October 1994 and early 1995. Agents and their E&amp;O
insurers have said that they will fiercely contest all the actions, with
appeals likely. Nevertheless, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Names
action group, believes his group can obtain compensation through the courts
by the end of next year. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's,
predicts no awards will be made until 1998.
From the market's point of view, legal action and the attendant publicity
would damage its image, especially in the US. However, following the arrival
of institutional investors at Lloyd's the market is in a much stronger
position than six months ago. Capacity - the amount of premiums that Lloyd's
syndicates can accept - rose to Pounds 10.9bn this year, an increase of
Pounds 2bn on 1993. Insurance rates are rising. Efficiency is increasing and
profits are likely for 1993.
So is Lloyd's out of the wood?
Not yet. Lloyd's has two sets of problems to resolve. First, losses for 1991
and 1992 - which the market will report over the next 18 months - are
forecast to reach Pounds 3bn, inflicting further damage on Names and
stretching the ability of many to continue trading. The losses could deplete
the market's central fund to such an extent that Lloyd's may have difficulty
proving its solvency later this year.
A bigger long-term problem is the potential number of cases arising from
asbestosis and pollution claims in the US. Lloyd's has embarked on an
ambitious plan to transfer more than Pounds 4bn, which it holds in reserves
against these claims, into a reinsurance company, NewCo, to seal off the
problem from the rest of the market.
It is too early to say whether this effort will succeed. In the meantime,
more and more syndicates will seek to 'commute' many long-tail claims,
negotiating deals with policyholders to settle at less than the full
potential value of the claim.
So should you become a Name?
You may not have the opportunity. Over the next year the move towards a
fully corporate Lloyd's market - in which the liabilities of investors are
limited - is likely to pick up speed.
Corporate investors are likely to increase their share of the market next
year and some agents are considering converting the pooled investment scheme
set up for Names last year into shareholding companies with limited
liability.
Mr Robert Hiscox, the iconoclastic deputy chairman of Lloyd's, has
questioned whether new Names, trading with old-style unlimited liability,
should be permitted to join the market. 'I just don't think you should have
two classes of shareholder,' he said. The implication was clear: Lloyd's is
heading down the road of limited liability.

FT  14 FEB 94 / A reality check on healthcare reform: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was something of the doctor's reassuring bedside manner in the Clinton
administration's presentation of its healthcare reform proposal. The plan
would end uncertainty about health insurance by guaranteeing all Americans
access to care that 'could never be taken away'. Yet it would not involve a
large extension of government because employers would continue to finance
most care. The proposed regional alliances or purchasing co-operatives would
simply 'manage' competition between private sector providers.
In presenting their plan this way, Bill and Hillary Clinton were bending the
truth. Under their scheme, people would remain insured even if they or their
employers failed to pay the required premiums. They would remain insured
even if the health plan they joined went bankrupt. But there is only one
entity that can provide such an absolute guarantee: government. As the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - an independent fiscal watchdog - ruled
last week, the Clinton reform is essentially a public-sector plan dressed in
private clothing. 'It would,' said the CBO, 'establish both a federal
entitlement to health benefits and a system of mandatory payments to finance
those benefits that represents an exercise of sovereign power. In
administering the proposed program, regional alliances, corporate alliances
and state single-payer plans (if any) would operate primarily as agents of
the federal government.'
The CBO concluded that health alliances should be treated in the same way as
Social Security, the federally-run pension scheme. The transactions of
alliances would be 'off-budget' - treated separately from other federal
accounts. But premium payments would count as federal revenue.
The CBO's logic is hard to fault. Under the White House plan, all
individuals would have to purchase insurance and all employers would have to
pay 80 per cent of the average cost of health premiums. The federal
government, moreover, would largely determine the level of those premiums
and the nature of the benefits they purchased. A new agency, the National
Health Board, would control the rate of growth of premiums; and the net
financial burden on companies and individuals would depend on the level of
subsidies voted by Congress.
The way certain financial flows are classified ought not to matter a great
deal. But in practice the CBO report is political dynamite because it
implies the Clinton plan would result in a huge expansion of the public
sector. Within a decade, alliances would be collecting more than Dollars
500bn in premium payments from companies and individuals (as well as nearly
Dollars 250bn in direct federal subsidies). The Clinton scheme would thus
supplant social security as the largest federal entitlement programme and
dwarf such minor enterprises as the Pentagon.
If enacted, the reform would eventually raise federal spending by perhaps
six to seven percentage points as a share of gross domestic product,
bringing the US into line with other industrial countries. The CBO carefully
avoided the dreaded 'T' word; but the compulsory health premiums would
obviously represent a correspondingly large increase in the federal tax
base. As a final blow, the CBO rejected the White House's optimistic claims
that healthcare reform would reduce the budget deficit by Dollars 60bn over
the next five years, claiming it would, instead, raise the deficit by
Dollars 70bn. Indeed, it would act as a budgetary drain at least until 2004.
The politically damaging CBO report follows public rejection of the White
House proposals by three leading business groups and a blizzard of negative
TV ads financed by the private health insurance industry. The Clintons thus
face a Sisyphean struggle in negotiations with congressional leaders.
Yet they still hold some cards. Who can deny the moral force in Mr Clinton's
claim that a civilised country should guarantee universal health cover?
Under the present regime, private insurance is beyond the means of many
working people. A chronic illness or an uninsurable 'existing condition' can
bankrupt even the affluent. No other developed country countenances such
barbarism.
By insisting on a honest presentation of the Clinton plan as a public sector
solution to this acute social problem, the CBO has performed a valuable
public service. But in doing so it has not demolished the plan; on the
contrary it says the White House proposals will guarantee universal cover
and will, eventually, reduce the growth of healthcare spending, in the
process saving US industry billions of dollars.
The US now faces a painful choice. There are plenty of piecemeal ways to
improve access to healthcare and reduce upward pressure on costs. Congress
can pass laws to prevent insurance companies discriminating against the ill,
to provide cash subsidies toward the cost of insurance for poor families, to
cap the tax deductibility of premiums, and to facilitate the creation of
private purchasing co-operatives for small business. This, essentially, is
the approach favoured by Republicans and conservative Democrats.
But it is no use pretending that such incremental changes can provide the
absolute guarantee of health cover sought by Mr Clinton and long delivered
in Europe, Japan and Canada. Government alone can provide this guarantee and
only the American people can decide whether the goal is important enough to
warrant an historic extension of the public sector's role in society.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Lining the executive nest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a great weekend for British capitalism. On Friday night,
British Aerospace confirmed the widely reported departure of its chairman,
Mr John Cahill, with a laughably inadequate explanation of why he was
leaving less than half way through a five-year contract: 'This is an
appropriate moment for him to relinquish the chairmanship to allow him to
spend more time . . .' and so on and so forth. No mention here of the widely
discussed confrontations with his fellow executives, or of his potential
profits on stock options estimated at Pounds 3.2m. Yet this huge reward
raises questions, not only about British Aerospace, but also about
managerial incentives in British business.
Yesterday, an analysis in The Mail on Sunday added to the view that company
executives find it too easy to line their own nests. Immediately after the
privatisation of the regional electricity companies - at share prices which
were designed to attract buyers - directors were granted stock options which
are now falling due, and which will reportedly bring them profits of some
Pounds 18m. Rewards on this scale may be appropriate for entrepreneurs in
high-risk businesses or new start-ups. They seem out of place in an
established regional utility.
In Anglo-Saxon corporate culture, the performance of companies tends, for
better or worse, to be closely identified with the individuals at their
helm, who are often rewarded accordingly. This must at least in part be
because they are freer from the controls imposed on German or Japanese
companies by supervisory boards, or from the direct power exercised by
stakeholders, such as the banks or other large shareholders.
There are plenty of examples in the US and the UK to show that such freedom
can be abused.
Roulette
In a report on today's management page, Lucy Kellaway suggests that
executive share options have more to do with roulette than with rationality
 -and, it might be added, the game is played with very favourable odds.
According to a survey published today, most shareholders agree that existing
schemes are flawed, in that executives stand to gain in a rising market, no
matter how poor their company's relative performance may have been.
So far, investing institutions have had great difficulty in agreeing
sensible benchmarks of company performance which should determine the value
of stock options for individual directors.
M&amp;G, the unit trust group, argued recently that such benchmarks were
inappropriate anyway, in that they could be distorted by accounting changes
and lead managers to massage short-term profits, in order to boost the value
of their options. That would seem to be an argument for doing away with such
rewards altogether. Reuters has devised, as an alternative, a restricted
share scheme, whereby the better the company performs, the more shares its
directors receive.
Disapproval
In the end, stock options and more general questions about the overall level
of executive remuneration must be a matter for shareholders to resolve.
There are welcome signs that they are taking this task more seriously - a
five-year contract of the type signed by Mr Cahill in 1992 would probably
meet with their disapproval in today's climate.
At the least, there is a need for greater transparency of the value of
incentives granted, including options. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board has stirred up a hornets' nest in the US by proposing tough new
disclosure standards. That is no reason for not getting on with the job in
the UK. Given the potential conflict of interest between the managers of an
enterprise and its owners, all incentives schemes need full and thorough
justification.
Once schemes are made sufficiently transparent, public opinion has a role to
play as well. The main threat to the political legitimacy of British
capitalism would be a widespread perception that those who run it are, at
best, unduly greedy. A climate of opinion that condemns out of hand schemes
able to reward managers regardless of their individual performance is in the
best interests not only of companies and their shareholders, but of the
capitalist system as a whole.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The statement by Sir Robin Butler, head of the Home Civil Service, to
the Scott inquiry will be given a sympathetic hearing by many who agree that
the reporting may have pre-judged the issue ('Civil service head asks Scott
to 'undo damage' of inquiry', February 10). Unfortunately, the statement
includes a remark which appears most sinister in its implications.
Sir Robin claims that 'the victims (the civil servants) are often
middle-ranking officials who could not have expected to be thrust into the
limelight'. Does he mean that they did expect not to be found out? Or is he
perhaps claiming safe haven for them because they were only following
orders?
From time to time even middle-ranking officials have to take courage, stand
up and be counted, preferably long before the matter comes to public
inquiry.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If public service minister, William Waldegrave, has evidence to show
that market testing has led to savings of 25 per cent, together with
improvements in the quality of 1 in 3 of the services tested, why does he
continue to refuse to publish a single piece of evidence to substantiate
these claims? ('Public work totalling Pounds 1.1bn put out to tender',
February 8).
Only recently, a whole series of obviously co-ordinated parliamentary
answers from each department of state refused to give MPs any information on
the level of savings that had accrued from their market testing programmes.
Each answer was also carefully worded to indicate that, while at some point
in the future overall figures for savings would be released, these would not
be broken down by individual market tests.
The minister's remarks on quality must also be taken with a huge pinch of
salt. As one of our main criticisms of the whole market testing process is
precisely that the new contracts for services do not contain mechanisms for
properly checking and monitoring quality, the assertion that services are
already getting better is ridiculous.

FT  14 FEB 94 / The enigma of the UK output gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation may be a monetary phenomenon. But bank notes do not rush off on
their own account into the shops to bid up prices and wages. Some
transmission mechanism is required.
One of the most important of such mechanisms works through the gap between
actual output and productive capacity. A small gap means the economy is
working flat out and that firms are willing to pay more to attract workers
and are able to edge up profit margins. When the gap is large, wage
inflation will decelerate and margins will come under pressure.
In the 1950s and 60s, available labour was regarded as the main constraint
on output, and the gap was estimated from the difference between actual
unemployment and some definition of reasonably full employment.
Since then, there have been two big changes in how the capacity gap is
viewed. First, the proximate constraint on output is now plant and business
capacity, rather than labour. Secondly the size of the gap which
policymakers have to tolerate can no longer be determined by some view of
desirable output or employment levels. The gap is too low when inflation
begins to accelerate; and something then has to be done to ease demand.
How much effective spare capacity is there in the UK in that case? The Bank
of England has given a range of 3 to 7 per cent and the Treasury suspects
that the true figure is nearer the top of that range. Indeed, a gap of
nearly 6 per cent emerges from projecting the trend rate of economic growth
of 2 1/4 per cent per annum from the end of 1990, when the economy appeared
to be in balance with neither too much nor too little pressure of demand.
David Walton argues in the February Goldman Sachs Economics Analyst that the
true gap is much smaller - between 1 1/2 and 3 per cent. This could have
great practical importance, if it meant that growth could not continue for
much longer above trend without the government having to put on the brakes.
Walton reaches this conclusion by using the Central Statistical Office index
of cyclical indicators, a method he admits to be highly unreliable, with
biases which he tries to correct. The Bank of England makes a case in its
new inflation report that there is more unused capacity than City analysts
suppose. There are signs that the scrapping of capital has been less than in
the last recession. Moreover, the recession was concentrated in areas such
as services and contracting, where fixed capital is less important. It will,
therefore, have done less than past downturns to reduce supply potential.
Walton in fact doubles back on himself by arguing that his own very modest
estimate of excess capacity is not a reason for holding down economic
growth. As he remarks, firms which say they are working near capacity can
often still make use of extra workers - and, indeed, install new capacity.
Thus, in the end we come back to the labour market and the question of the
minimum rate of unemployment consistent with non-accelerating inflation (our
old friend the Nairu). Econometric estimates are not much use here if they
vary, as the Bank of England tells us, from one million - which allows
plenty of headroom for above-trend growth - to near the current 2.8m, which
would not leave much gap to fill.
Amidst this welter of concepts without good numerical estimates, there is
one thing we do know. This is that, whatever the output gap, it is narrowing
smartly. We know this from the combination of the unexpectedly sharp fall in
unemployment and other labour market indicators, and from business survey
evidence.
We can also be reasonably confident of one theoretical point. This is that
underlying inflation depends not only on the size of the output gap but on
the rate at which that gap is changing. When the gap is already shrinking -
and there is thus no real need to worry about the strength of the recovery -
why take risks with a clumsy base rate cut? Forecasts about the effects of
tax increases in a financial year which has not even started cannot be a
sufficient reason.
No doubt, many of the financial market operators who responded badly to the
base rate cut had never heard of the output gap or the Nairu. And by last
Friday they had a more familiar misleading knee-jerk indicator to react to,
in the shape of one month's trade figures. But, abstracting from all the
froth, they did have deeper reason to worry that there was something not
quite right about the way the base rate decision had been taken.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crackdown on fraudsters should be
intensified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTYN E JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The status of the City of London as the premier global financial centre
is one of the UK's most important assets. However, this position is at risk
because large fraud is a growing problem.
Recently, there have been initiatives by the government, the Securities and
Investments Board and the accounting institutes to increase the detection
rates of fraud. These initiatives are to be commended and should result in
some increase in the level of detection of City fraud and abuse. However,
they are not enough - prevention is better than cure.
Touche Ross believes that there is further scope to crack down on fraud.
Fraudsters are tempted to deceive auditors and regulators because the laws
in this area are weak and not being enforced as vigorously as they should be
 -there is no effective deterrent. This problem can be overcome by making
knowingly deceiving an auditor or regulator an arrestable offence with a
maximum custodial sentence of five years. Also, any person who commits such
an offence should be made liable (without indemnification from any other
party) for any losses that arise. We believe that more prosecutions focused
on such an offence would be a useful deterrent not only for would-be
fraudsters but also for their cronies and subservients whose participation
is usually essential to perpetrate a large fraud. It would also result in a
tougher and quicker system of prosecution and trial which provides better
value for money.
Toughening up the law on deceiving auditors and regulators could have
another useful effect. Because big fraud usually involves deceiving auditors
or regulators or both, tougher laws in this area could open the way to some
deregulation of City rules and regulations, many of which are directed
towards more minor abuses. By removing some of these rules and regulations,
the war against fraud would be better focused and could even help London
enhance its global position by reducing the burden on honest businessmen who
would have nothing to fear from new laws in this area.
Ultimately, what matters most is that fraudsters should be made to pay
dearly for the damage that they inflict on their victims. Those facing fraud
charges should not receive legal aid while continuing to live the 'life of
Riley'. It is time we cracked down on fraudsters and stopped them hurting
their victims, who are often the weakest members of society.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Justifiable way to boost exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A K GOLDSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Arms and the dam' (February 8), you urged MPs
investigating the Pergau project to consider also more general questions
about the purpose of the aid budget, and whether it should be used to boost
non-military exports. British contractors working in international markets
would welcome a public discussion of these issues.
Our main competitors have no inhibitions about using bilateral aid to
promote their own exports. Britain has for many years given less bilateral
aid, both in value and as a proportion of total aid, than any of its main
competitors. This is a handicap for British contractors, and for the large
network of suppliers and subcontractors throughout the UK which depend on
them.
The Aid and Trade Provision (ATP) was set up in 1978 specifically 'to
finance sound development projects in circumstances where British firms were
having to contend with aid-backed offers from their competitors'. It is an
internationally-recognised form of aid, covered by stringent OECD
guidelines, and currently accounts for less than 5 per cent of the total
Overseas Development Administration budget. It has enabled a number of sound
development projects in Asia and Africa to go ahead which would otherwise
not have done so, to the benefit of their economies and of our own. We
believe it would be in the interests of the taxpayer for more of our aid
budget to be spent in this way, and we are more than willing to participate
in public debate on this issue.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Things threaten to fall apart: A failure of political will
endangers South Africa's transition to democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will we, five or 10 years from now, look back on the events of the past few
weeks in South Africa and say: That was when it all started? That was when
South Africa's dream of a stable, prosperous, multiracial nation turned to
ethnic nightmare?
Every South African, every international investor, every foreign government
 -everyone with a constructive interest in the African continent - must hope
that scenario is mere hysterical fantasy. Many believe it is: they argue
that the far right's support is minimal and the strength of the military
overwhelming; that South Africa's security forces can crush violent dissent
from the black and white right, which have vowed to resist April's all-race
elections and missed their final chance on Saturday to register for the
poll, so casting doubts over whether a poll can be conducted in all parts of
the country.
But if no one can quite believe that South Africa could join the list of
ethnic horror stories of our time - it is a fate too ghastly to contemplate
 -the country's politicians have yet to demonstrate the will to avert such
an outcome.
The collapse of trilateral talks between the government, the African
National Congress and the rightwing Freedom Alliance illustrates a
spectacular failure of political will on all sides. A deal was within reach
which might have brought at least a large proportion of the white far right
and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party into elections, consolidating the
centre and leaving only the lunatic fringes in violent opposition. But in
the end, South Africa's politicians failed to reach out and take it.
It is easy to heap most of the blame on Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi: he shouts at journalists, insults ambassadors, exasperates
businessmen and, in the words of political columnist Ken Owen, of the
Johannesburg Sunday Times, 'has alienated his democratic friends, here and
abroad, by petulant quarrels . . . surrounded himself with eccentric
foreigners and sycophants . . . (and) drifted into shabby alliances with
bantustan leaders and rightwing racists' - among them Eugene Terre'Blanche,
leader of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB). Chief Buthelezi is his
own worst enemy.
But if his behaviour is outrageous, his demands for constitutional change
are not: one can question his motives, his reliability as a negotiator, his
willingness to contest free elections. But his basic constitutional demand
is far from unreasonable: he wants a federal South Africa, arguing that such
a model would best cater for one of most ethnically fragmented societies on
earth.
No issue is so central to South Africa's future: will the political system
guarantee ethnic minorities real power, or relegate them to the role of
permanent, impotent opposition? Every democracy is, in some sense, the
dictatorship of the majority. But can South African democracy survive if the
constitution creates permanent losers, who can never hope to rule? Can it
prosper if a significant minority of the electorate rejects the legitimacy
of the constitution.
Federalism would offer regional minorities, such as the Zulus, a chance to
secure a political base, and use it to keep the majority - ruling from the
centre - in check. But the ANC is suspicious of this argument: for its goal
has always been to create a colour-blind South Africa where ethnicity is
subsumed in a single nationhood. (Afrikaner Volksfront leader General
Constand Viljoen mocks this, saying nations cannot be built 'like you make
instant coffee': a little black, a little white, a little bit of coloured .
. .)
Still, the ANC seems willing to accept the need to accommodate Afrikaner
ethnicity. For though it is easy to dismiss the white far right as
neo-fascist racists, the ANC accepts that some ordinary decent Afrikaners
also want a homeland, or volkstaat. Indeed, though the deal has since fallen
through, the ANC agreed in principle to establish such a volkstaat after the
elections, with a separate Afrikaner chamber in parliament to work out the
details. But when it comes to assuaging Zulu fears of domination, the ANC
draws the line: they believe Chief Buthelezi's only goal in arguing for
federalism is to perpetuate his power in a tribal state called KwaZulu.
While they are prepared to allow the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to remain
a symbolic monarch under Natal's new constitution, they refuse Chief
Buthelezi the strong provincial powers he demands. It is almost as though
the ANC accepts that whites may fear blacks - but that blacks may not fear
other blacks. Yet the history of African decolonisation suggests the highest
price is usually paid by Africans.
So, after 2 1/2 years of stop-start constitutional negotiations, the gulf
between the rightwing and the ANC remains as wide as ever. The ANC believes
it needs a strong central state to carry out its sacred charge: to empower
blacks economically, after centuries of deprivation. And the right wants
regional autonomy to protect itself if the ANC uses that central power to
oppress rather than to uplift.
Yet even some ANC officials believe the party did not try hard enough to
accommodate the Freedom Alliance. It could have conceded marginally greater
powers to regions, including limited regional taxation, and offered to
entrench these powers in the final constitution. Such a deal was on the
table, agreed between the Freedom Alliance and government last year, but the
ANC rejected it. In the end, the ANC made a purely tactical offer: two
ballots, but nothing on regional powers. They won the tactical battle, but
lost the moral high ground.
'I put myself 10 years down the road and I say: should we have been so
stubborn on this and that? Was it worth it?' asks one ANC official. His
concern is echoed by a government negotiator: 'Is the ANC really prepared to
accept a civil war to ensure central government has overriding powers on
health policy?'
Even now, it is not too late to avert this grim prospect, whatever legal
deadlines have passed. Parliament could retroactively extend the election
registration deadline. Creative solutions could be found to allow
last-minute participation, but only if parties find the will to reach real
agreements, and not just move deadlines. At least all parties say they are
still committed to negotiations, and have stopped short of an overt call to
violence.
There is a chance that the white far right could yet be persuaded to
participate: both the ANC and AVF tried hard to do a deal, and may yet
succeed. But the breach with Inkatha appears permanent. Inkatha negotiator
Ben Ngobane accuses the ANC of 'sacrificing national unity for power'; it is
far from clear that the ANC is willing to reverse that order of preference.
Either way, April's elections will almost certainly go ahead, however
violently the right resists. Government officials vow that they will be
'ruthless' in suppressing dissent (with full ANC support). As one government
official says: 'If the fight is on, then it is on. We will act with full
force right at the beginning and wipe them out.'
But one can be forgiven for wondering whether the right - the Zulu impis
(war parties) and conservative whites with military training and access to
commercial explosives from the mines and, possibly, to larger arms from
military armouries - can be crushed so easily. Neither is a majority, even
within their own ethnic group; but each, and especially both together, can
cause havoc through sabotage and terrorism, and a sharp increase in serious
township violence.
Ben Ngobane warns: 'The constitution should reflect the diversity of South
Africa. If it does not, there is every chance that there will be no new
South Africa.' Dr Ngobane is almost certainly wrong. The new South Africa
will be born on schedule; but it could prove less stable, prosperous and
democratic than seemed possible only months ago. South Africa's politicians
can step back from the brink - but first they must find the will to do so.

Why do we so readily talk about 'shoplifting' when we mean theft? People who
steal from shops are just as much thieves as the chaps in black masks with
sacks marked 'Swag'. Even the publicity for Cutting Edge uses the silly
euphemism. The programme looks at the efforts made by shops and police to
hold back the rising tide of shop theft, and interviews 'Megan' who is
described as 'Britain's top shoplifter', meaning Britain's worst shop thief
presumably (9.00 C4).

FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Youthful promise - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Wigmore Hall Marks &amp; Spencer is sponsoring a three-concert series,
'Outstanding Young Artists'. The second concert was given on Thursday by the
20-year-old pianist Leon McCawley, who failed to win the Leeds competition
last September. The jury was widely thought to have made the wrong choice -
especially because McCawley was roughly ten times as creatively illuminating
in Beethoven's First as the eventual winner was (his name escapes me) in the
'Emperor'.
My own vote would have gone, like the BBC-2 viewers' ballot, to the American
Mark Anderson - unmatched for 'mature range and communicative power', I
wrote here at the time. McCawley's virtues were more specialised, though
brightly original and winning in the right repertoire. An 'outstanding young
artist' he certainly is; but his Wigmore recital made one reflect once again
that the best thing for most OYAs would be to emerge for public appearances
just a few times per year, and then return to private, self-critical
development.
The recital's best moments had a true first-water sparkle, above all in four
Scarlatti sonatas. McCawley turned period-ornamental passages with rare
grace and feeling, as he had done at Leeds in Haydn and early Beethoven.
Though he was artfully tender with the rubato breaks, he indulged too many
of them for the good of Scarlatti's brilliant energy - and he varied them
hardly at all in the many repeats.
Instead of more Haydn or early Beethoven, McCawley chose to offer us the
last and most monumental of Beethoven's sonatas, op. 111 in C minor. Only in
the last generation or two have ambitious young pianists taken to displaying
themselves in late Beethoven, like novice conductors undertaking late
Bruckner or Mahler symphonies because those are famous test-pieces.
The trouble is that late Beethoven is neither very showy nor outstandingly
tuneful. McCawley's op. 111 was sincere and thoughtful, not much more. A
fine sense of the near-orchestral muscle in the Allegro, once past a pallid
prologue; then some moments of shining simplicity in the Adagio variations,
not threaded upon any continuous, compelling purpose.
After the interval he played Skryabin's moonstruck op. 57 pieces exquisitely
and bloodlessly (which may be right). The earlier, more robust op. 42 Etudes
had sensitive moments, but in no. 1 the tune disappeared altogether.
In Liszt's Venezia e Napoli suite, McCawley delivered the gloomy central
'Canzone' louder than almost anything else in his programme, and the
showpiece fizz of the final Tarantella never accumulated the head of steam
it deserves. (Balasz Szokolay, a 1990 Leeds competitor, made something
memorably electrifying of it, despite far more fingerslips.) If McCawley
were to concentrate for the moment on the rich range of what he does best,
that would be far better than trying to stake claims to the whole virtuoso
repertoire.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Chamber-sized Turandot in Cardiff - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'coming-of-age fable'? This is not the answer many opera-lovers would give
if faced with the riddle of categorising Turandot. Puccini's final opera,
conventionally treated as fantastic fairy-tale spectacle, has frequently
been agonised over by tender-hearted liberals on account of the monstrously
violent view of male-female relationships expounded at its core. Given the
character of Liu's death and Turandot's eventual submission, the idea that
the piece could ever be staged to embody positive, even PC values - to
represent a 'developing personality moving toward fruition' - seems
improbable.
The above quotations are extracted from a Welsh National Opera
programme-book interview with Christopher Alden, producer of the company's
new Turandot. Fortunately, his show proves itself a much sharper, snappier
framing of the argument than in advance I could have believed possible: not
completely successful, in truth, but replete with a decisive, individual
brand of theatricality that adds new zest to one's experience of the whole
work.
Alden - twin-brother of David, whose ENO Mazeppa, Masked Ball and Ariodante
have provided London opera-goers with some of their most celebrated
deconstructionist splendours (or, according to taste, miseries) of the last
decade - uses the limitations of the Cardiff New Theatre stage-space and the
in-built restrictions of WNO production scale to make this a chamber-sized
Turandot, in which startlingly beautiful stage feats are accomplished with
streamlined simplicity. Brilliantly designed by Paul Steinberg, the set is
an enclosing curve of purple corrugated iron, marbled in patterning, and
capable of reflecting and enriching the bold variations of storybook
costume-colour and lighting in which each narrative shift is signalled.
The China thus summoned up is a curious dream-world blend of antique ritual
and rigid Maoist regimentation (the three masks seated at bright red desks
and typewriters, the tiered chorus in white school-shirts and black ties).
At its best this novel evocation of Gozzi-via-Puccini is full of clean-cut,
witty imagery; at other times it is too obviously reliant on the slow-motion
parading and floor-level trailing of identikit-surrealist modern opera
production.
The concern to humanise both main characters and to treat Liu and Timur as
Jungian 'guiding shades' is not comprehensively carried through - how could
it be, since it is not what Puccini intended? And withal, the freshness of
the approach and the wholehearted commitment of all its executants certainly
plead tolerance of the attempt.
Saturday was one of the WNO Chorus's best evenings in years. It was also a
good outing for the company's casting department: worthwhile newcomers (such
as Anthony Stuart Lloyd, the soft-grained young Timur) and company regulars
(David Barrell, the drily skilful Ping) in smaller parts, an interesting
choice of principals. Mary Jane Johnson's singing of Turandot may be an
acquired taste - notes simultaneously hard and curdled mingle with powerful,
radiant ones - but her presence is exactly judged; Edmund Barham's first
Calaf, very well studied, lacked his usual forceful projection (an
unannounced cold?); in her British debut the American Patricia Racette, a
soprano at once vibrantly emotional and subtly reticent, gave Liu's music
more definition than anyone else on stage.
The disappointment was the conducting of Carlo Rizzi, who unfolded some
parts of the score with sparkling precision, rushed, flubbed and fumbled
others, breathed too little air into the panoply of exquisitely finished
nocturnal sonorities, and generally gave the impression of not having
focused an 'all-through' interpretation of the opera. When he has, this will
be a Turandot of unusual distinction.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Heritage of the recent past - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heritage is a flexible word, and some people may be surprised to hear of it
being applied to the present century. But at a seminar in London last week,
the word was used to describe post-war (the second world war) architecture
in England. The seminar was part of a campaign by English Heritage to
inspire more public debate about the listing and protection of the nation's
post war buildings.
The listing system, which protects historic buildings in England, is an area
of contention. Listing does not necessarily protect a building from
demolition. But the process can make demolition difficult if planning
authorities apply listing regulations with rigour, causing delays and
frustrations wherever possible. Sometimes, however, planners let buildings
fall down or agree to certificates of immunity from listing in a way that
does no credit to the system or to the consistency of bureaucratic judgment.
It takes a partisan architectural historian or a practising Marxist to see
merit in many of the concrete towers and crumbling town centres that passed
for architecture in the years 1945-1970. It is difficult to find a consensus
on the quality of much of the detritus of that period, which was why English
Heritage called the conference. It was wise of English Heritage to include
in their deliberations not just the naturally biased architects of that
generation, but also property developers, engineers and town planners and
members of the press and public who care about architecture.
It was English Heritage, under the sometimes inspired chairmanship of
Jocelyn Stevens, which initiated a research programme in 1991 to encourage
both experts and the public to consider a more systematic approach to
listing the architecture of this tricky period.
The most difficult architectural, aesthetic and philosophical judgments are
those about the period that is nearest to us. This is just as true when it
comes to literature, painting, sculpture and music. Judgment needs the
perspective of time.
When the idea of listing buildings began as a result of the 1947 Town and
Country Planning Act, the problem buildings were those of the Victorian and
Edwardian periods, and nobody was looking at the work of the architects who
designed buildings during the reigns of Kings George V or VI.
It was not architects, but writers like the late Sir John Betjeman and Dr
Mark Girouard, who encouraged the development of a public affection,
sometimes a sentimental one, for Victoriana and Edwardian taste. To date,
what listing has supposedly achieved is the recognition of the major
architectural creations of all periods up to the recent past.
A building has to be 30 years old to be considered for listing, with the one
exception; that of a later building which is considered outstanding, if it
is in grave danger of demolition or irrevocable alteration.
In 1970 that great lister of the buildings of England, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner,
identified the first 50 inter-war buildings to be listed. Today there are
more than 600. It is his legacy of thoroughness that inspires the
researchers of English Heritage.
Some 750 post-war schools, colleges and universities were carefully examined
and last year the Secretary of State for National Heritage accepted the
recommended final list of 95 separate educational establishments.
It is a fascinating, if controversial, list which includes three schools
designed by the pioneering Hertfordshire County Council in the late 1940s
and early 1950s. These are schools redolent of the brave new world that was
about to emerge through the policies of the welfare state. They are the
antithesis of the cosy Victorian village schools; they have large windows,
colourful panels and that sense of perpetual sunshine that was to enlighten
our post-war children. I was a post-war child and I well remember that
strange mixture of excitement and disappointment when I was transferred from
an Edwardian citadel of learning, with its copper domes and rows of arched
windows, to a naked and pristine new box unrelieved by any aspirational
ornament.
There are some horrors on the educational list that are no doubt
historically important, like the school at Hunstanton in Norfolk by Alison
and Peter Smithson; the first but not, sadly, the last Brutalist school.
James Gowan and James Stirling's Leicester University Engineering Building,
in all its angular red glory, is now a listed building as an original
pioneer of British High tech architecture. Sussex University by Sir Basil
Spence, England's first post-modernist architect, is now an elevated Grade I
monument. That distinction rightly belongs also to St Catherine's College,
Oxford, by the Danish master of modernism Arne Jacobsen.
There are other types of buildings on the first major post-war list -
Coventry Cathedral by Sir Basil Spence and, as of last week, the Roman
Catholic Cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool, designed by Sir
Frederick Gibberd. That great adventure in reinforced concrete with its
staggering parabolic curved roof, the 1952 Stockwell Bus garage for London
Transport by the architects Adie and Button, is now a starred Grade II.
Public housing from the post war period is a very dicey area. So often the
idea is significant, but the quality of execution and maintenance leaves a
lot to be desired. Tower blocks like the Trellick Tower by Erno Goldfinger
and the 'cluster' block, Keeling House in Bethnal Green (now in decay and
more or less uninhabited) by Sir Denys Lasdun are on the list as cynosures
of a particular moment of social housing.
An exhibition of some of the grand ideas and failed ambitions of the
post-war period will tour the country to encourage more public involvement
in the listing process. It can be seen in the City of London at 125,
Cutler's Exchange, Hounsditch from 16-25 of February under the winning
title: 'Age of Optimism'. It is worth seeking to enter the debate. After
all, anyone can write to the Secreary of State for National Heritage to
suggest a candidate for listing. It is all much too important to be left to
architects.

FT  14 FEB 94 / People: Leng - A rare species for Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean-Pierre Leng, who has just been appointed head of the EU's Gatt
delegation in Geneva, is a rare species of Eurocrat, write Lionel Barber and
Frances Williams.
Unlike many of his senior colleagues who spend their time clambering up the
greasy pole in Brussels, Leng has risen to the top of the Commission's
diplomatic service via foreign postings.
He has spent the past three and a half years in Tokyo as head of delegation,
but he also worked for five years in the mid-1970s in the Commission's
bureau in Washington. While he has been with the Community since 1959, his
only lengthy stint in Brussels was between 1984 and 1990, when he was
involved with textile and steel negotiations, before becoming the director
in charge of relations with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
In the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which ended last December, the
European Commission's negotiating mandate on behalf of the 12 member states
was vastly enlarged to encompass trade in services and intellectual property
as well as trade in goods, its traditional staple.
In addition to handling trade negotiations on behalf of EU members, Leng's
immediate agenda also includes China's bid to rejoin the Gatt and future
Gatt work on trade and the environment.
He will also just see in the new, more powerful World Trade Organisation
which will replace Gatt and which is expected to come into being sometime
between January and July of next year. However, he reaches 65 in September
1996 and hence will have been in harness for much less time than his
predecessor, Tran Van Thinh.
A diminutive Vietnamese-born Frenchman, Tran, who was 65 this month, had had
an usually long 15-year stint. The antithesis of a grey-faced Eurocrat, he
was ebullient and unpredictable, with a strong line in extravagant
metaphors.
Highly respected as a skilled negotiator and deal-broker, his farewell
speech to Gatt's annual meeting last month combined, in typical fashion, a
humorous 'ten commandments of Gatt' with a deadly serious proposal for an
import levy to finance environment projects in developing countries.

FT  14 FEB 94 / People: Noto follows well-oiled path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the future for the US's oil giants rests overseas, then Lucio Noto looks
well qualified to head Mobil, the country's second-biggest oil group, writes
Richard Waters.
Noto, 55, takes over the reins at Mobil on March 1, when veteran chairman
and chief executive Allen Wallace retires. Unlike other US oil industry
chiefs, Noto has spent most of his working life outside of the US.
Mobil is already one of the most internationally active of the big oil
groups. Given the diminishing returns from exploration in the US and the
high costs of refining there, most oil groups have their sights set on
investment overseas, and Mobil is no exception.
Noto, whose parents emigrated to the US from Sicily, is a native of Brooklyn
and New Jersey. After joining Mobil in 1962, he held senior marketing and
planning jobs in Japan and Italy before running Mobil's operations in Saudi

diplomat and tough businessman.
It was Wallace, with Mobil for 41 years, who brought Noto back to the US in
1985 and prepared him for the top job. He was made head of planning and
economics, then chief financial officer in 1989 and president and ceo last
year.

FT  14 FEB 94 / People: Stenhammar ruffles more feathers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olof Stenhammar, founder of the options exchange OM and one of Sweden's
foremost entrepreneurs, seems to enjoy ruffling feathers at his old
adversary, the Stockholm Stock Exchange, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
SSE executives were less than thrilled when Stenhammar launched his company
in the mid-1980s; as they saw it, he was treading very much on their own
patch. They are unlikely to be any more enthusiastic about his latest move.
OM has bought 13.4 per cent of the exchange - one of the few to have been
privatised - and is now its biggest single shareholder.
Stenhammar plays down talk of an eventual takeover, saying merely that the
move is a 'very good investment'. But whether it will result in greater
collaboration between the two has yet to be seen.
Stenhammar, 53, showed entrepreneurial tendencies early on, selling plastic
swimming pools to fund his university studies. When he moved into the
options world - an idea he got while working as a broker in the US - OM was
the first privately-owned profit-orientated exchange in the world. In
addition to its Swedish activities, the group is very active
internationally, including ownership of the OMLX exchange in London.
There is, however, one cloud on the horizon. Stenhammar and two colleagues
are currently being investigated by the state prosecutor over allegations of
insider trading. They bought a block of shares in OM just three weeks before
it announced interim figures last year, shares which promptly rose in value
on the day the figures were published.
Stenhammar's defence is that OM is an unusually transparent group, because
it reports turnover figures every day, and therefore he didn't know anything
more than the market.
One member of Sweden's close-knit financial community says the episode shows
Stenhammar's judgment is not what it used to be. For example, when he
launched OM, he lined up Sweden's powerful Wallenberg dynasty as
shareholders to ensure success.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Monday Interview: A duty to the public good - and a strong
balance sheet / GKN's Sir David Lees tells Lucy Kellaway that his intentions
for Westland are honourable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The word 'hostile' makes Sir David Lees flinch. The ultra-polite executive
chairman of GKN does not like to hear his bid for Westland talked about like
that.
Images of battle might seem fitting for the unfriendly takeover of a defence
company, especially as the last time Westland changed hands two cabinet
ministers and their jobs parted company and the government nearly fell in
the process.
But Sir David presents his attempt to buy the infamous helicopter company
rather differently. Watching him as he sips tea out of a fine china cup in
his elegant office very near the Queen Mother's London residence, it is
clear that aggression and unpleasantness are just not his style.
GKN, as he tells the story, has been a loyal and supportive shareholder in
Westland for five years. Last week it bought the shares of another
long-standing shareholder, and as required by stock exchange rules, it
dashed out a bid for the rest of the company. The fit is good, the
intentions honourable; there is nothing hostile about it, he says.
Yet the fact remains that Westland is fighting hard for a higher offer, and
is protesting loudly that GKN does not love it for itself alone, but for its
tax advantages.
Sir David deals calmly with the allegation of opportunism. His account
stretches back through a decade or more, charting GKN's steady, cautious
expansion into defence. He talks about tax and about greater stability of
earnings, but also underlines some similarities between helicopters and
GKN's armoured vehicles.
But, a reasonable man, he is careful not to push the point too far. 'I can't
pretend that a Warrior can fly or that helicopters can race along the
ground.'
Some might say that his bid is opportunist, but none could say it was hasty.
Sir David is an accountant by training and does not like to rush into
things. In the years he has held the Westland stake, he has done a lot of
pensive sitting, and quiet listening. 'He takes a long time to make up his
mind. But once he makes a decision he's very determined,' says a close
colleague.
These careful characteristics have stood Sir David, now 57, in good stead so
far. In his six years as chairman, and five before that as finance director,
he has built up a financially strong company involved in three sectors:
motors, industrial services and defence.
He has been a master at cutting costs, and at getting rid of all those
loss-making businesses that in the old days made Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds
great. In all, it has been a defensive operation, turnover has not grown in
real terms, but the quality of the businesses is far better, and the balance
sheet stronger.
'I've taken the group through a difficult time, cleaned it up. We've
maintained the dividend for shareholders, and the balance sheet is as strong
as it's ever been. I'm proud of that,' he says.
Sir David has a tidy mind, and wants to stick to the discussion in hand. For
instance, last summer he was in a car crash in which he broke six ribs and
punctured a lung, but he will not be side-tracked into discussing that, and
persists in telling me how well GKN is doing in Japan.
This vision of a civil, cautious man, who is good with numbers, does not
capture the whole of him. 'Really quite jolly,' is how one colleague
describes him. He is also a good family man, the sort of bloke who is quite
happy kicking a ball about on the lawn of his Shropshire home after Sunday
lunch.
More than that, he is public spirited. If you read the list of the external
positions he has held (which run to two pages on his cv) and hear the
high-minded talk about it, you might think him a bit of a prig.
Yet he avoids that label. He is both modest and direct, looks you in the
eye, and answers the question. He does the extra work, he says, both because
he loves it, and because he feels it is his duty. 'If members of big
institutions are not prepared to take the lead, you get a feeble institution
and have only yourself to blame. People at the top of companies have a duty.
Pro bono publico.'
His experience at the CBI, where he is chairman of the Economic Affairs
Committee and at the Bank of England of which he is a director, has given
more insight than most businessmen possess into public life. He is said to
be outstandingly good at dealing with ministers and officials: civil but
firm.
It does not seem to have gone to his head. 'The Bank of England invitation
came as a very great surprise. When I was asked to go to see the Governor, I
thought there must be some problem somewhere.'
His style is distinctly unflashy. He is a member of the sensible school of
management - it is no great surprise that he cites Sir Christopher Hogg,
with whom he sits on the board at Courtaulds, as a kindred spirit and as
someone he admires.
He is no autocrat, and has secured some plain speaking heavies, such as
Howard Davies at the CBI, as non-executive directors on the GKN board. He
believes in the free market but is repulsed by excess. 'I was immensely
impressed at how Margaret Thatcher freed up management at the beginning of
the 1980s, but possibly society has moved a bit far to the right in terms of
materialism.'
When invited to criticise his peers for their outrageous pay packets his
words are carefully measured. 'I accept that market rates have to be paid to
get good people. But on the other side of the equation, that must not lead
to an excuse for greed.'
Sir David says he runs his car for 120,000 miles before he trades it in, and
last year waived his bonus because he did not think the group had done well
enough for him to merit it. Moreover, no GKN executives travel first class
on aircraft. 'We do not do this to be hairshirt, but we do what is
necessary. I know it sounds pious, but we lead from the top and set an
example.'
As he sits there, urbane and relaxed, discussing the rights and wrongs of
corporate excess, you would never guess that for the last week he has been
burning the midnight oil in a high-profile takeover battle - sorry, process
 -of which he has little experience.
Evidently, he is feeling on top of his job. 'If you enjoy it enough, there
are bad days. It's like golf. You can play a couple of bad shots, but when
you play well, you feel the best in the world.'
If he wins Westland, will he feel the best in the world? Once again he is
cautious. 'There is strategic rationale there. I look forward to a happy and
not acrimonious outcome.'

FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel: Oases for athletes - Joggers' Guide / Cairo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is possible to jog in Cairo - just. But there are healthier and more
pleasant ways of staying fit during a trip to the Egyptian capital than
inhaling the clouds of car fumes and tackling its assault-course pavements.
If you are brave enough to do business in Cairo - several tourists have been
killed by fundamentalist terrorists, who are also threatening to target
foreign investment - then hotel health centres are perhaps the most suitable
places to keep in trim.
Among the best of these is the Nile Hilton, Cairo's oldest five-star hotel,
on the banks of the Nile. It offers a centre with jogging machines, weights,
a steam bath and sauna, all of which can be used by non-residents for
EPounds 31 (roughly Pounds 6) a throw. The Nile Hilton also has a
decent-sized pool, a pair of squash courts and clay tennis courts.
The jogging machines and other fitness equipment in the Marriott Hotel on
Zamalek island in the Nile are also well maintained and open to
non-residents. There is an adjacent pool and its artificial-surface tennis
courts offer about the truest bounce in Cairo.
But if nothing less than a long, outdoor jog will do, there are ways and
means, despite the busy chaos of Cairo's streets and lack of parks. An
extended run south along the banks of the Nile from the main riverside
hotels in central Cairo might offer the fewest hurdles or interruptions, but
the route - as with most runs in town - is alongside a busy main road.
This way you will encounter perhaps the most serious deterrent: pollution in
Cairo's streets is terrible. According to UN figures, Cairo's 1m cars emit
more than 1m tonnes of lead into the streets a year - not surprising given
the poor state of most vehicles. Cars are not required to meet any
officially tested level of main-tenance, and more than 60 per cent are over
10 years old.
The heat and the nature of Cairo's streets mean that the resulting heavy
fumes are seldom cleared away by winds. The truly determined athlete might
consider wearing a mask.
There are a few oases where a more pollution-free run is just about
possible. Probably the best is the Gezeira Club on Zamalek island, opposite
the main strip of five-star hotels in central Cairo. An EPounds 10 entrance
fee wins access to the biggest green space in central Cairo, which has a
battered but serviceable running track and several football fields.
There is even a horse-racing track around the outside, which would offer a
good workout - but be ready for a sprint along its southern fringe, which is
prowled by packs of mangy wild dogs.
Social runners could join up with the Hash House harriers, who meet two
hours before sunset every Friday for runs by the pyramids or in the desert.
You can find out where they are meeting by phoning numbers in the back of
the widely available Egypt Today magazine. After each run, the Cairo Hash
works hard at replacing lost fluids with beer.

Hotel rooms in Osaka are the most expensive in the world, costing an average
Pounds 166 a night, a Hogg Robinson Business Travel survey reports. Tokyo
was the second most expensive city, at Pounds 162 a night. Third place was

FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Flight of fancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Our account last week of travellers' difficulties with airlines requires a
correction, according to the Air Transport Users Council, a UK body which
represents air passengers' interests.
Mr David Darby, a London patent agent, received cash compensation for his
wife and two children after they were bumped off a flight from the US to
London.
Mr Darby argued, and Continental Airlines eventually accepted, that
compensation was due under European Community regulations because the flight
ended in the EC. The Council points out that the regulations apply only to
flights departing from the EC.
Mr Darby was entitled to compensation, but that was because the flight
originated in the US. Passengers bumped off flights leaving the US or the EC
are entitled to compensation. In other countries, compensation is entirely
at an airline's discretion.

Transport hubs in the north eastern US returned to near normal yesterday
after days of struggle caused by the worst snow storm in more than a decade.
Freezing drizzle and light snow were reported in a wide area from Baltimore
to Boston in the early hours of Sunday, but there no hint of any repeat of
Friday's knockout punch that paralysed the region with a foot to 18 inches
of snow.
All main airports were open, and trains and buses were running on time. Both
Kennedy and Newark airports reopened after being closed most of Friday.
Spokesmen for big US airlines said that, weather permitting, they hoped
those airports as well as Laguardia would be operating normally.

Travellers to Japan today should check the status of their flights before
leaving for the airport. The worst snow storm to hit Tokyo and its
surrounding areas in 25 years left the country's road, rail and air traffic
paralysed yesterday.
Shinkansen 'bullet train' services were running slow, airports were crammed
with passengers unable to take flights on Saturday and most main highways
leading to the capital were closed.
Saturday's storm meant many international flights heading for Tokyo were
diverted to Hokkaido in the north. Tokyo's main international airport at
Narita was closed and cut off from the capital on the weekend.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel: The risk of going that extra mile - What
might happen if all air passengers tried to cash in their offers at once
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Free airline seats are a perk for the frequent air traveller. But visions of
aircraft full of passengers flying for free are beginning to trouble the
airlines. How could the airlines cope? Might the cost force them to renege
on their free-flight offers, or close down the frequent-flyer programme
entirely?
Frequent-flyer schemes are designed to make passengers loyal to a particular
airline. They are awarded points - Air Miles in British Airways' case, for
example - when they fly. The points can be accumulated and eventually cashed
in for free tickets.
Concern has focused particularly on the BA programme. The fear is that the
scheme's 3.5m members could swamp the airline's flights if all those
eligible requested their free tickets at once.
Such worries are not with-out foundation. During the 1980s, some US
carriers, such as Pan Am, offered ever greater frequent-flyer incentives to
passengers. Eventually, holders of free tickets displaced genuine fare
payers, hastening Pan Am's descent into bankruptcy.
BA, which started its scheme in 1988, says this cannot happen today. At
worst, it concedes, scheme members might not be able to book seats on their
first choice of flight. This is already the case for 2 per cent of people
asking for free tickets.
The airline is confident nothing will go wrong, because it controls the
number of tickets given away on each flight. It and many other airlines have
computer programmes that predict how full the flight will be. The results
are used to forecast demand, plan capacity and allocate seats to
frequent-flyer programme members and to other incentive schemes, such as
that run through the UK food retailer, J. Sainsbury.
The principle is simple, says BA: 'We do not give away any seats we think we
can sell.'
In its last full year, BA had a 'load factor' - the average proportion of
seats filled on its flights - of 66 per cent, a figure that historically is
high for any airline. The remaining 34 per cent of seats on its 240 aircraft
are available to be offered in incentive schemes.
Last year, Air Miles travellers accounted for only about 5 per cent of these
spare seats. Even if all 2m air miles accumulated by scheme members and not
yet redeemed were cashed in this year, this would only take 10 per cent of
the unused capacity.
Much of this spare capacity, however, is on flights to less popular
destinations. The seat you want on a flight to the city where you are doing
business might be unavailable.
There are three busy periods when all seats are likely to be taken by
fare-payers: the first and last flights of the days to business destinations
such as Paris and Brussels;
the first and last flights of the week to long-haul business destinations
such as New York and Hong Kong;
and peak holiday times such as July and August and Christmas.
You may get a free seat on one of these flights, says BA, but it is 'likely
to be more difficult'.
Some of this is in the small print of the frequent-flyer scheme rules, as
are other restrictions such as expiry dates on air miles awarded.
But as seasoned business travellers must already have suspected, when faced
with the choice of pleasing applicants for free tickets or passengers
proffering ready cash, any airline is going to take the money.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Management: Hard news behind the headlines - ITN has
revolutionised its staffing policies without industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In just seven years the resonant tones of Big Ben that start News at Ten
have tolled for half the jobs at ITN, the independent television network's
flagship news organisation. Behind the headlines there has been a quiet and
sometimes painful revolution in the way that its news gatherers work.
The role of Mike Morris, its departing director of personnel and industrial
relations, has been central to the achievement of often radical changes
without industrial action. When he took over the job in October 1987, ITN
had 1,200 specialist staff, many earning City dealing room salaries. While
the pressures of change were building up, ITN was protected by statute from
competition and seemed to enjoy a secure position within the ITV network.
Now, as Morris starts a new career as director of personnel at the Royal
Opera, he leaves a network broadcasting more - but not necessarily better -
news coverage from fewer than 600 staff with a broad range of skills.
Demarcation lines are fading as journalists learn technical skills and
technicians learn journalism. Neutral job titles such as 'news assistants'
and 'journo-techs' have been introduced to promote multi-skilling, and the
numbers and influence of technicians and engineers have dwindled.
Traditional pay bargaining has barely survived  - last month a number of
staff agreed to a pay cut in a ground-breaking deal which saved further
redundancies.
The company's pay and staff-cutting polices have reduced ITN's annual pay
bill from Pounds 42m in 1991 to Pounds 26m today. 'That doesn't happen by
accident. The potential for getting it wrong in a highly unionised
atmosphere with a perishable product is pretty high,' says Morris.
Achieving the transformation without the confrontation that accompanied
innovation in the newspaper industry relied on a combination of shrewd
management, good fortune, technological change and new labour laws.
Morris looked first at new ways of making programmes in the US and East Asia
before confronting technicians with multi-skilling, a term then unknown in
the industry. The trade unions called it 'cross-jobbing'. 'It was not on the
agenda as far as they were concerned,' says Morris.
Today, technological innovations, such as lighter, automated cameras mean
that the normal crew can be just two - one with editorial background and one
with technical. Journalists know how to operate cameras and technicians
learn editing and writing skills.
Management plans in 1988 to change terms and conditions coincided with a
TV-am dispute when technicians walked out on a one-day strike and were never
allowed back. It was a sobering lesson for the unions at ITN. National
agreements had already been abandoned by the ITV network. 'We started with a
blank sheet of paper and tried by careful preparation to draw the trade
unions into a dialogue with us. By the end of the negotiations they felt as
much owners of the plan as we were,' said Morris.
The 'total pay plan' negotiated that year abolished overtime, perks and old
working practices and introduced annualised hours into employment contracts.
Negotiators had no scope to buy off the old terms, but they did have the
advantage of dealing with people who could not get the same terms and
conditions anywhere else.
Until his appointment, Morris says, ITN management had believed programmes
could not be broadcast without union co-operation. There was also concern
that a confrontation could escalate across the network. During the
negotiations ITN made no secret of contingency plans to maintain the service
in the event of a strike, which it also made clear would lead to a
TV-am-style lockout.
The proposals were only narrowly sold to the three main unions. 'What they
were voting for was a reduction in terms and conditions. There was no
disguising this. They recognised we were very determined,' said Morris.
The total pay plan has not gone completely smoothly. The problem of staff
finishing their work allocations well before the year end has sometimes
needed imaginative reward ideas.
The impetus of change was maintained by the Broadcasting Act of 1990 which
introduced greater competition to the industry. Under a new form of
ownership, ITN changed from a cost centre to a profit centre exposed to the
threat of competition.
As the pressure on costs continued, an across the board pay freeze was
imposed in 1991. This year there has been scope for some discretionary pay
rises.
While overheads have been pared to the bone, the business is beginning to
grow, with additional services such as provision of news coverage for
Channel 4's Big Breakfast and the negotiation of a contract with NBC
Superchannel.

British Aerospace has undeniably done well for its shareholders in the last
two years. But whether John Cahill, the chairman, really deserves a Pounds
3.2m profit on his executive share options for his role in the recovery is
another matter.
Institutional investors have long felt that something is rotten in the way
most option schemes are designed, and are preparing for a battle over the
need to link them more closely to performance. The very size of the Cahill
profit is further grist to the mill for those who believe executive share
options have more to do with roulette than rationality.
This year shareholders are faced with a chance to address the problem. Most
of the existing 10-year schemes were introduced in 1984 to take advantage of
tax breaks, and now have to be renewed.
The occasion is the cause of great controversy. Options matter to
shareholders for two reasons. The first is that they are the only part of a
manager's overall pay on which investors have the chance to vote; they
therefore become the focus for all concerns on the excesses of executive
remuneration. Second, they can be worth a lot of money. Sometimes - as in
Cahill's case - they are the largest part of the total, but even in less
headline-grabbing cases they can still be significant.
A survey published today by Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, shows
the average value of 154 options cashed in recently was nearly Pounds
55,000, with the range stretching from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 1m.
Nearly all shareholders agree that existing schemes are flawed. Typically, a
handful of senior executives are entitled to buy shares (worth up to four
times their salary) at today's price in three years' time. If the share
price rises, they stand to gain no matter how poor the company's relative
performance has been.
Yet there is still disagreement on the best way to go forward. The two main
investor bodies, the Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds, agree that schemes should be tied to a
performance yardstick, but have spent months debating which measure was
best. The ABI pushed for earnings per share while the NAPF argued for share
price performance relative to the stock market. The compromise reached last
summer is that each company should choose the measure that suits it best.
Any company which fails to comply runs the risk of having its scheme voted
down by shareholders.
Even this solution is not accepted by everyone. M &amp; G, the unit trust group
(ironically itself a big institutional investor in other companies), has
ruffled feathers recently with its own new scheme which does not include any
performance measure at all. Paddy Linaker, managing director of M &amp; G,
justifies the move by arguing that it is hard to find an appropriate
benchmark; earnings per share can be distorted by accounting changes, and
share prices can be skewed by a number of factors including takeovers.
Worse, he fears, a benchmark could make the behaviour of mangers short term,
could fail to reward companies that have done well in difficult
circumstances, or could encourage managers to be reckless in the hope of
meeting targets.
Some companies agree with him but cannot follow suit, as unlike M &amp; G they
do not have loyal controlling shareholders to vote such a scheme through.
'Most companies seem prepared to comply with the guidelines, but without any
enthusiasm,' says Mark Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants.
Richard Regan of the ABI denies that companies are reluctant. 'Most
managements have said Amen to this, because they want their executives to
perform.' According to Nicki Demby of Arthur Andersen the range in schemes
being introduced is enormous. Grand Metropolitan was one of the first to
bring in a relative share price yardstick, with options that can only be
exercised if the shares outperform the FT-SE 100. BP, meanwhile, has decided
to measure itself against the rest of the oil sector. Trafalgar House is
leaving it vague, saying that the relevant board committee will decide on
the best performance measure closer to the time. The Daily Mail's options
scheme is dependent on its earnings growth exceeding inflation.
The most radical plan announced so far is from Reuters, which has decided to
scrap its options scheme altogether and replace it with a restricted share
scheme. This entitles directors to receive regular instalments of shares so
long as the company is performing. The better the company does, the more
shares the directors will get. Reuters has chosen to measure its performance
against total shareholder returns (share price plus dividend) of the top 100
companies.
'I am trying to make Reuters look at itself in the same way as investors
do,' says Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters. So far the company's
plan has been greeted with guarded interest both by other companies and
shareholders. There are few precedents for it in the UK and, while in the US
restricted shares are commonplace, not many have this sort of performance
measure attached to them.
Even Sir Christopher is a little uncertain as to how it will work. 'It's
suck it and see,' he says. He points out that if directors find themselves
getting too many or too few shares, the remuneration committee will simply
change the rules.
The Reuters scheme is one of the few likely to meet with the grudging
approval of one shareholder group, the Pensions and Investment Research
Consultants. Last week PIRC wrote to its pension fund clients advising them
to vote against all new options schemes unless they were radically altered.
Anne Simpson, a PIRC director, argues that share options are a poor
motivator as executives can only gain but not lose money, and that they do
not encourage share ownership as executives tend to cash in their gains at
once.
Moreover, she complains that executive options are inequitable as they are
only open to a minute proportion of the workforce - while the real credit
for success should be spread more widely.
PIRC's recommendation that all schemes be voted down unless they are open to
all employees is unrealistic. Indeed it would mean that only a tiny handful
of companies would be given the go-ahead. However, says Simpson, the aim of
the recommendation is not to overturn all schemes now but to keep up the
pressure on boards to bear such things in mind as integrity and equity when
it comes to setting pay.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Pay falls 'below old minimum rates'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abolition last summer of the wages councils, which set minimum pay rates
for about 2.5m people, has resulted in a substantial drop in pay rates, the
Low Pay Network says today.
In the first detailed survey of the consequences of abolition, the
independent lobby group found that 18.1 per cent of jobs were paying below
the last wages council rate.
The survey, covering 1,500 vacancies at 46 Jobcentres, found that 27.1 per
cent of jobs in the retail sector were paid below the last wages council
rate, followed by hairdressing with 20.8 per cent, the clothing industry
with 13.8 per cent, and hotel and catering with 12.2 per cent.
It found underpayment ranging from an average of 9.2 per cent in the
clothing sector to an average of 22.6 per cent in hairdressing, where the
last set rate was Pounds 2.88 an hour.
Before abolishing the wages councils, the government argued that removing
the statutory minimum wage would have little impact on wage levels or
employment.
This was based partly on research into the effects of taking away wages
council cover in 1986 from people under 21. This found that only a small
number of people were affected. The Low Pay Network, however, said that
about a third of young people were hit by the move.
Ms Gabrielle Cox, author of the report, said: 'It is clear that the
abolition of wages councils has caused a significant impact on pay levels.
It is alarming that so soon after abolition nearly a fifth of wages council
vacancies show an erosion of pay rates.'
One Whitehall official conceded that the survey looked thorough but pointed
out that the proportion of people being offered hourly rates below the
minimum might have been similar before abolition.
Campaigners estimate that at least 15 per cent of people in wages council
jobs were underpaid before abolition, and many such jobs were advertised in
Jobcentres.
What Price Abolition? Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit, 23 New Mount Street,
Manchester M4 4DE. Pounds 1.50.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Lottery player alleges dirty tricks bonanza: As bidding
closes today for the licence, Motoko Rich reports on the campaigns of two
companies which are fighting for a slice of the business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Have you been brown-enveloped yet?' asked Mr Craig Watson, vice-president
for public affairs at G-Tech, one of the world's leading lottery operators.
He wondered whether the Financial Times had received an anonymously sent
package of potentially damaging material about G-Tech, which he believes is
part of a smear campaign to damage the company's chances of winning a role
in the UK's first national lottery.
The Financial Times has not received a brown envelope but a journalist on a
leading Sunday newspaper said he had. G-Tech said that so too had a daily
newspaper. According to Mr Watson, 'dirty tricks campaigns' have dogged the
company ever since it had emerged as a leader in its field.
Bids close today for the licence for the UK lottery, which is designed to
raise cash for charity, the arts, sport, national heritage, and celebrating
the millenium. G-Tech is battling for a slice of the business against its
main US rival, Automated Wagering International. G-Tech has a 22.5 per cent
stake in one bidding consortium, Camelot, and both companies are keen to
sell computer hardware to the licence holder.
The competition for the UK licence is taking on some of the characteristics
of bids for US contracts, which are aggressive, litigious and highly
political. Although the two companies are openly critical of each other, AWI
denies that it is behind a UK campaign to discredit G-Tech. Mr Dan Bower,
AWI's chairman, said: 'To my knowledge, we are not running any smear
campaign.'
The material in the brown envelopes, mostly US press cuttings, alleges that
G-Tech uses questionable techniques to influence lottery officials who award
contracts and politicians who determine lottery legislation. G-Tech declares
itself innocent of all such charges. It points to the six court cases
challenging its contracts in the US, of which it has lost none.
It also cites its recent success in winning a contract in Texas to provide
an electronic system for making welfare payments. 'G-Tech was vetted at the
highest level by the federal government in order to win that contract,' said
an adviser to the company, which is based in West Greenwich, Rhode Island,
and holds 26 of 36 existing state on-line computer lottery contracts in the
US. It operates 65 lotteries worldwide. Last year the company reported a
turnover of Dollars 501.4m with profits after tax of Dollars 21.7m.
AWI holds seven US on-line computer lottery contracts and provides lottery
services in Norway and four provinces in Canada. It has annual US revenues
of about Dollars 115.5m and profits of Dollars 12.9m.
In the UK competition it is not part of any consortium, but it has agreed to
supply hardware to three of the bidders: Rank Organisation, the Great
British Lottery Company and Games for Good Causes. Like G-Tech, AWI has
supplied the Australian company Tattersalls, which is in partnership with
the merchant bank NM Rothschild as another bidder for the UK licence.
Estimates for the UK lottery's eventual annual turnover range from Pounds
2bn to Pounds 6bn annually.
Between 1989 and 1991, when the UK government was considering whether to
launch a lottery, G-Tech made two written submissions on how it should be
operated.
Because most big lottery licences are awarded by governments after a
competitive tendering process, those who wish to run the games need an
astute understanding of politics. Mr Mark Cushing, senior vice-president for
public affairs at AWI, said: 'You cannot participate in the industry and not
be involved in politics.'
G-Tech devotes considerable resources to the political process. It employs
Lowe Bell Communications, a public relations company at which Sir Tim Bell,
Baroness Thatcher's former PR adviser, is chairman, and one of G-Tech's main
consultants. Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, a former cabinet minister, is a
G-Tech director. The company says that Lord Moore is 'very non-executive'
and has been 'kept out of their government relations work'.
In the US, it uses lobbyists and political advisers from 24 consulting
companies, many of which include former government employees on their
payrolls. Mr Watson said: 'We try to learn the way government works and we
employ consultants who are familiar with the way contracts are awarded. We
are quite comfortable and secure in our use of lobbyists.'
Some US politicians and G-Tech's competitors, notably AWI, have questioned
the company's relationship with regulators and politicians there. AWI's Mr
Cushing said: 'The American lottery industry has become highly politicised
and our view is that it is driven by G-Tech's political connections.'
However, an abuse of political ties by G-Tech has never been proved.
Last year, AWI lost a court challenge of the award of the New York lottery
contract to G-Tech. Its suit against G-Tech's success in the bid for the
Georgia lottery is pending.
AWI alleges that G-Tech was awarded the contract with a bid that was as much
as Dollars 22m higher than AWI's. Georgia state representative Mr Matt
Towery was concerned by the appearance of unfairness. He said: 'There was a
perception that once we had opened up the bidding process and received the
numbers we were trying to decide how to give the bid to our friends.'
In Maryland, a grand jury investigation into the state's 1992 lottery
procurement process - although not G-Tech itself - is pending. Mr Leon
Billings, a Maryland state delegate who asked the US attorney to launch the
investigation, is suspicious of the company's lobbying techniques. Mr
Billings believes that a G-Tech lobbyist had access to information that led
G-Tech to bid low in 1991, knowing that it would be able to obtain valuable
add-ons to the contract without competition in 1992.
Perhaps the most embarrassing case for the company has been the action
against Mr Clay Jackson, a G-Tech lobbyist who was convicted last year on
bribery and racketeering charges. However, the jury did not find that Mr
Jackson had bribed a convicted state senator to vote against lottery
legislation opposed by G-Tech and the company was never charged with any
crime. During the trial a tape was played in which Mr Jackson described Ms
Sharon Sharp, California's lottery director, as 'our gal'. Just before Mr
Jackson's conviction, she resigned.
AWI has also faced allegations of impropriety. Video Lottery Technologies,
AWI's parent company, had its licence to operate a video lottery in
Victoria, Australia, revoked in 1992 when the company's former chairman
stepped down amid allegations that he had done business with convicted
criminals. That licence was reinstated last year but the lottery commission
in Quebec, Canada, has now denied the company a gaming licence.
Last April West Virginia's former lottery director was indicted by a federal
grand jury on charges including the allegation that he tried to secure a
monopoly contract worth about Dollars 25m for a VLT subsidiary. The company
has not been indicted in connection with the case.
Mr Peter Davis, the lottery's director-general, said: 'One of my obligations
is to satisfy myself that all the applicants are fit and proper and I shall
conduct whatever investigations I deem necessary.'

FT  14 FEB 94 / Glasgow gas group aims for consumers nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caledonian Gas, the gas subsidiary of ScottishPower, is attempting to become
gas supplier to many of the 60,000 households all over the UK which are
entitled to choose a supplier other than British Gas.
It is launching a mailing campaign to target British Gas customers who take
2,500 therms or more of gas a year, equivalent to an annual bill from
British Gas of Pounds 1,120.
A customer paying Pounds 1,120 a year to British Gas is promised savings of
about Pounds 100, while a property with a gas bill of Pounds 2,000 would
save Pounds 173.
The Glasgow-based company believes it is the first independent gas supplier
to target large domestic users in addition to the commercial and industrial
customers who are the independent gas suppliers' main market. It already has
a handful of domestic customers in Scotland.
It believes that the campaign, covering the whole of Britain, should give it
a head start for when the domestic market with its 18m customers is opened
to competition from April 1996.
British Gas is obliged to deliver gas on behalf of other suppliers.
Caledonian Gas pays British Gas to transmit its gas, read its customers'
meters and provide safety cover.
The mailshot will emphasise that transferring to an independent gas company
does not involve disconnection or installing new pipes. New customers of
Caledonian Gas would notify British Gas that they wish it to terminate
supplies.
Caledonian Gas is targeting homes which have installed gas central heating,
have at least five bedrooms and were built before 1979, making them unlikely
to have heat insulation.
Caledonian Gas hopes potential customers who receive the mailshot will pass
on the word to their neighbours. Those whose gas consumption is below the
2,500-therm threshold can pre-register for the opening of the market.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Low skills 'deter investors to Wales'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The success of Wales in winning inward investment is being threatened not
only by greater competition but by its lack of labour skills.
This is the finding of a report by the Centre for Advanced Studies at the
University of Wales, Cardiff, which describes the vocational education and
training system in Wales, as elsewhere in the UK, as 'woefully inadequate'.
It says that the skills deficit is most acute in the craft and technician
category. 'While the UK has been adept at producing an educational elite, it
has manifestly failed to equip generations of young people with the
vocational skills which are necessary to sustain a modern manufacturing
sector.'
Wales, with less than 5 per cent of the UK's population, attracted more than
14 per cent of UK inward investment between 1979 and 1991, which helped its
manufacturing sector to grow while in the UK as a whole it declined. But the
report warns that inward investment is likely to decline sharply during the
1990s.
'Strengthened competition from other regions within Europe, as well as from
low-cost locations in eastern Europe and Latin America, coupled with the
loss of assisted-area status, will make Wales relatively less attractive.' A
further handicap, it says, is the quality of labour and suppliers.
Alfred Teves, a German automotive components company at Ebbw Vale, is quoted
as describing the calibre of electricians and engineers as 'absolutely
poor'.
Robert Bosch, the German components and power-tools group at Miskin, near
Cardiff, regards its workforce as highly motivated and finds labour costs
much lower than in Germany. But managers claim that the labour market in
Wales, as in Britain, is like a sandwich. At a higher level, they say, the
calibre of personnel is on a par with anywhere in the world, as is the case
with semi-skilled or unskilled workers who they consider very adaptable. But
they find grave problems at the middle level of supervisors.
The report says Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics group at Bridgend,
Mid Glamorgan, has been unable to meet its apprentice targets in recent
years because of the deteriorating quality of applicants.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Votes speed communication unions merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates from the two biggest communications unions voted decisively to
merge yesterday.
The votes, taken at separate delegates conferences in Bournemouth, marked
the first and most important step in the merger process between the Union of
Communication Workers and and the National Communications Union which is
expected to create a single group by December.
Delegates from the 175,000-strong UCW and the 126,000-member NCU were being
asked to back a legally binding instrument of amalgamation. The UCW voted
overwhelmingly to support the amalgamation and the NCU was two-to-one in
favour.
Discussions on a combined rulebook went less smoothly but union leaders said
they expected their executives to reach an acceptable compromise on rules to
allow the merger to be voted upon at the annual conferences of the unions in
May and June.
Conference decisions in favour of the merger will then be put to the full
memberships for a final endorsement.
The two union general secretaries - Mr Alan Johnson of the UCW and Mr Tony
Young of the NCU - said their ability to defend members' jobs would be
strengthened if everybody was in the same union.
Both unions face continuing membership losses because of the rundown in
jobs. The merger, which will create a union of some 310,000 members, is seen
as a way of strengthening the industrial power of workers in the Post Office
and British Telecommunications and also as a way of opening up new
recruitment areas in Mercury and cable television.
Mr Young said the proposal was 'not a takeover of one union by another'. but
'a genuine partnership'. The two general secretaries will work in tandem
until 1998.
The proposed merger timetable requires a postal ballot of the members of
both unions to agree on a name for the new body to take place over March and
April. While several names have been suggested, the most likely choice is
the Communications Workers Union.
One possible obstacle could emerge tomorrow when the result of the NCU
general secretary election is to be announced. Mr Young has faced a
difficult struggle against Mr Bill Fry, a leftwing candidate, who wants the
union to adopt a more militant strategy.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Graduates warned not to delay job search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graduate job-seekers risk missing out on recruitment opportunities if they
leave applications until the summer, a leading employer has warned.
Mr Peter Johnstone, Human Resources manager at Mobil Oil and vice-chairman
of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, said students were being told
that employers were not recruiting when in fact the big recruiters were
planning to fill their vacancies by Easter.
Mr Johnstone's warning, in the latest issue of Personnel Management Plus,
the Institute of Personnel Management's magazine, reflects a revival in
graduate recruitment among large employers.
'Fatalism has percolated through to the 1994 crop,' he said. His own company
was planning to take on more graduates, but the number of applicants had
fallen by a quarter.
He said: 'Undergraduates have been told by their academic counsellors that
there aren't any jobs and they should concentrate on getting a good degree
and then enter the summer marketplace.'
Students, he warned, would 'miss the boat' if they did not apply now. Many
companies with staff-cutting programmes are deliberately keeping quiet about
graduate recruitment plans for fear of upsetting existing employees.
Graduate recruitment has been declining for three years. Big employers such
as Marks and Spencer and IBM have frozen their programmes, and others have
cut numbers. This year, however, the number of graduates recruited is
expected to show a small increase.
The number of graduates coming on to the market is also increasing, leading
to greater emphasis by employers on assessment techniques to sift the best
candidates.

FT  14 FEB 94 / MPs confront a Scottish ghost: The start of a probe into the
local enterprise bodies beset by controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who preside over training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in England
frequently complain that their organisations have too low a profile. That
lament is unlikely to be heard from their Scottish equivalents, the local
enterprise companies (Lecs).
For the past year the 22 Lecs and their parent bodies have rarely been out
of the news. In Glasgow today the Commons Scottish committee opens its
inquiry into Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the
Lecs.
Critics accuse the Scottish Enterprise network of being unaccountable,
secretive, and wasteful. They allege mismanagement and conflicts of interest
in the Lecs.
Scottish Enterprise however, welcomes the inquiry and claims to have lobbied
for it in order to rebut criticisms. It believes the critics are ignoring a
success story.
The Lecs arose out of a decentralisation of existing bodies, the Scottish
Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board, formed
in the 1970s.
This meant that while the Lecs took on training functions, they also
inherited the economic development roles of the old bodies. Unlike the
English Tecs which stand on their own, the Lecs have parent bodies in the
enterprise bodies, which disburse money to them and act as a buffer between
them and the Scottish Office. They are expected to follow strategy set by
their parent bodies.
The creation of a network of local economic development bodies, spending
more than Pounds 500m a year, has led to an upsurge in economic activity.
For example in Edinburgh, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise has pushed
through projects such as the new Festival Theatre, while Lanarkshire
Enterprise is spearheading regeneration after the closure of the Ravenscraig
steel works.
But officials at Scottish Enterprise headquarters in Glasgow admit that the
performance of the Lecs has been uneven. Trouble first emerged a year ago in
Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise after criticisms of its chief executive.
Then the Scottish media focused on potential conflicts of interest between
the business affairs of the Lecs' unpaid directors - almost all of whom come
from the private sector - and decisions taken by the Lec boards. No case of
impropriety was discovered, but Scottish Enterprise has laid down that
directors' interests must all be publicly disclosed.
The only case of the many allegations which Scottish Enterprise has had to
investigate where a clear breach of procedure occurred involved a Lec chief
executive, who resigned last month over an undeclared conflict of interest.
Mr Henry McLeish MP, a Labour Scottish affairs spokesman, says conflicts of
interest are 'only a by-product of a system that is fundamentally flawed'.
He complains that the status of Lecs as private companies enables them to
keep many of their transactions secret and prevents them being publicly
accountable - in spite of their public funding.
A survey of company directors showed that a majority felt the Lecs were not
providing value for money in economic development, and that they were
altogether less effective than the defunct Scottish Development Agency.
The legacy of the agency bedevils the Scottish Enterprise network. Its
creation was partly motivated by the Conservatives' desire to obliterate a
Labour creation.
Critics of Scottish Enterprise would like the core body to be a more
powerful relative to the Lecs. But others, such as the Scottish Chambers of
Commerce, would like a strengthening of the Lecs at the expense of the core
body.
The Commons committee must grapple with conflicts such as these and others
which have plagued Scottish Enterprise from the start. Supporters hope the
inquiry will finally establish the legitimacy of Scottish Enterprise and lay
to rest the ghost of the development agency.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Widening of dam aid probe resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior members of the Commons foreign affairs committee are resisting
attempts to widen inquiries into links between arms sales and British aid
for a Malaysian dam project.
The committee, which has a Conservative majority, is investigating
allegations that Pounds 234m aid for the Pergau dam was illegally tied to
Malaysian purchases of British arms worth Pounds 1bn.
Conservative members of the committee agreed to an inquiry after it emerged
that aid was linked to defence sales during initial discussions of the dam
project in Malaysia.
However, some Conservatives are unhappy about Labour attempts to extend the
inquiry to include similar allegations relating to projects in Indonesia,
Thailand and elsewhere.
One accused Labour of trying to turn the investigation into 'another Scott'
 -a reference to the inquiry into arms sales to Iraq being carried out by
Lord Justice Scott.
'I am sure that the opposition would like to extract political mileage from
it, but I don't think that is going to be the wish of the committee,' he
said.
'There is not going to be a cover-up or anything like that, but the
difficulty is going to be where to draw the line on this. We could spend the
whole of next year on it, and we have already got a very heavy workload of
other matters.'
The committee has agreed to accept evidence at its next meeting on Wednesday
from the World Development Movement, a third world pressure group which
claims to have identified a relationship between the aid programme and arms
sales.
The movement has made repeated allegations about the sale of Hawk training
aircraft to Indonesia, which are alleged to have been used to attack
civilians in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony controlled from Jakarta.
However, the committee may decide to take no further action on the
allegations, or to delay an inquiry until it has completed several other
investigations.
In addition to Pergau, the committee is currently inquiring into relations
between Hong Kong and China, and is due to embark later this year on a major
investigation of arms sales by the former Soviet Union.

MPs on the standing committee studying the incapacity for work bill will

The move is intended partly to try and reassure opposition MPs that the
government is acting in good faith on what is a controversial measure. Such
conciliatory gestures are unusual in the confrontational forum of a standing
committee.
The bill is intended to ensure that incapacity benefit will only be paid to
those properly entitled to it.

Surrey district councils have announced plans to split the county into
either five or six unitary authorities as part of the English local
government review.
The move follows the call by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, for
local authorities to negotiate mergers which should then be presented to the
Local Government Commission. However, Surrey county council has not yet
decided on a formal policy towards the review, and at present leans towards
retaining the two-tier status quo.
Under the district councils' proposals, Woking, Surrey Heath and Runnymede
would merge to form one authority, and there would also be mergers of
Guildford and Waverley; Elmbridge and Spelthorne; Tandridge, Reigate and
Banstead, and of Mole Valley and Epsom and Ewell.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Action on modem imports urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-based electronics manufacturer is to press the government to outlaw
foreign-made computer communications equipment which has not passed UK
safety tests, Alan Cane writes.
Dataflex Design, a leading modem manufacturer, said yesterday that it would
begin importing and selling 'grey' modems - those not passed by the watchdog
overseeing the safety of telephone network equipment - on March 1 unless the
government took immediate action. It would continue to sell approved modems.
Some 30,000 modems, which convert computer messages for transmission down a
telephone line, are sold in the UK each month. It is not illegal to sell
'grey' modems, but attaching non-approved equipment to the telephone network
is a breach of the Telecommunications Act.
Sales of non-approved modems from the US and Asia, which cost much less than
products put through exhaustive UK testing procedures, have risen sharply
recently, leading UK manufacturers last year to form a defensive lobby. The
government agreed that, over a number of years, legislation would be
introduced outlawing non-approved modems. This is not fast enough for the
manufacturers.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Ministers seek to shrug off latest scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday called for an end to disclosures about the private
lives of MPs, as ministers attempted to shrug off the fourth sex-related
resignation in two years.
Senior Conservatives praised Mr Hartley Booth, MP for Finchley, for quitting
quickly as a minister's political assistant after newspaper disclosures of
his friendship with a female Commons researcher.
Mr Booth's resignation minimised the embarrassment caused to the government
by detailed allegations about the relationship in the Sunday Mirror. Mr
Booth denies sexual impropriety.
However, there was widespread concern that no end appeared to be in sight to
the catalogue of disclosures which has undermined the government's Back to
Basics campaign on traditional moral values since the start of the year.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said Mr Booth's resignation had
no connection with Back to Basics, launched by Mr John Major at the
Conservative party conference in October.
But, in a sign of the government's growing irritation about the stream of
disclosures, he accused the media of pursuing a 'ludicrous' campaign for the
government to 'purge itself' of MPs thought guilty of sexual impropriety.
'All the newspapers have got several journalists assigned full-time going
through files, going through every rumour they have ever heard, looking for
some scandal. I am amazed they have found so few,' he said.
'If they want to find a cabinet composed entirely of people who have never
committed any sin it is going to be a bizarre place. It would have to be
composed entirely of people like the editor of the Sunday Mirror, who I
assume is perfect.'
Mr Booth's resignation follows the resignations of Mr David Mellor, Mr Tim
Yeo and Lord Caithness from the government after media disclosures about
their private lives.
The Conservative party has also been rocked by the death of Mr Stephen
Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, in bizarre circumstances; and a series of
revelations about the extra-marital relationships of other Conservative MPs.
The government has virtually given up hope of winning the Eastleigh
by-election, expected to take place on May 5, in which the opposition
parties are expected to campaign strongly on moral issues.
The Liberal Democrat party, which came second in 1992, is favourite to win.
However, Labour plans to allocate its top by-election strategists to the
campaign, and frontbench spokesmen are soon to visit the constituency. 'This
is a genuine three-way split, and we intend to fight hard to win it,' said a
senior Labour official. 'We think we have a real chance.'

FT  14 FEB 94 / Brown says share options cost Pounds 100m in lost tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday that executive share
option schemes were costing the country Pounds 100m in tax relief.
Mr Brown was responding to a report in the Mail on Sunday that the 57 most
senior directors of the 12 regional electricity companies stood to gain more
than Pounds 18m on the exercise of executive share options granted when
their companies were privatised.
'We are losing twice over,' said Mr Brown. 'We are paying higher prices for
electricity as a result of the granting of these options and we are giving
tax relief on the share options.'
Mr Brown said the government was giving away Pounds 100m in tax relief by
treating the proceeds of executive share option schemes as capital gains
rather than income, 'which it clearly is'.
Revelations about the size of the profits the electricity company chiefs
stand to earn comes as opposition from large institutional shareholders is
increasing.
Last week Mr John Cahill stepped down as chairman of British Aerospace and
will earn Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3.2m) in the form of share options.
Share options are designed to focus executives' attention and tie their
compensation more closely to their companies' fortunes. But shareholders are
increasingly concerned that the rewards go too far.
The size of the regional electricity company profits may be particularly
embarrassing for the government as well. The options were granted soon after
the they were privatised in 1990 and became exercisable from late last
month.
The share prices have all risen to levels at least double the exercise price
of the options. All the companies have managed to reduce costs on a scale
not imagined when they were privatised and all produced sharply higher
profits when they reported interim results late last year.
But Mr Brown questioned whether the executives, who would become 'the first
privatisation millionaires', were justified in having the options: 'It is
the monopoly position that has been the advantage to them rather than their
own ingenuity or efforts.'
The electricity companies were unmoved yesterday. Eastern Electricity said:
'Share options are a fundamental and necessary part of executive
remuneration for all top UK companies. They focus directors' attention on
shareholder value.' Midland Electricity said its 'executives' efforts' had
lifted profits.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Fines for soft drugs may leap to Pounds 2,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will decide this week whether to impose
the first increase for 17 years in penalties for possession of a broad range
of illegal drugs, Kevin Brown writes.
He is considering proposals to raise the maximum fine for possession of
class B drugs from Pounds 500 to Pounds 2,500.
The main drugs affected would be cannabis, barbiturates and amphetamines.
There are no plans to increase penalties for possession of class A drugs
such as heroin and cocaine.
Home office officials say that a five-fold increase in penalties is needed
to take account of inflation and to bring fines into line with tougher
penalties for other offences.
Higher penalties would also signal that the government does not intend to
legalise soft drugs such as cannabis. Officials said there were no plans to
reduce the number of cautions for drug possession, which account for about
half of all cases investigated.
However, ministers are understood to be concerned that penalty increases
could worsen the backlog of court cases if it led to a rise in non-payment
of fines. If Mr Howard decides to go ahead, the government will table an
amendment to the criminal justice bill, currently passing through
parliament.
Organisations representing people who deal with drug users questioned the
logic of the move. The charity Release said increasing the maximum fine
would have no positive effect.
The Police Federation said the present maximum fine was rarely used.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the government should
concentrate on tackling the growing problem of hard drugs.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Procedural war set to escalate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row over the workings of a Commons committee is threatening to trigger a
damaging escalation of Labour's procedural war against the government.
Sir Terence Higgins, a senior Conservative backbencher, is trying to defuse
the argument, which has arisen over the Labour leadership's refusal to allow
its MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee to go on a planned trip
to South Africa.
Matters may come to a head on Wednesday when Tory MPs who form a majority on
the committee are threatening to force a vote of no confidence in Mr Richard
Caborn, its Labour chairman. Such a move would be expected to provoke Labour
to retaliate.
Sir Terence, a former Treasury minister, has been handed his troubleshooting
role by virtue of his chairmanship of the liaison committee, the body which
co-ordinates the work of the select committees.
Sir Terence said last week that the liaison committee was strongly of the
view that it would be wrong for any dispute between the political parties to
interfere with the work of the select committee system.
Mr Keith Hampson, a Conservative member of the trade and industry committee,
said Mr Caborn could have been removed last week but it had been decided to
give Labour time 'for common sense to prevail'. He added that the move was
not a personal attack on Mr Caborn.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, moved on Friday to scotch fears that
Labour's retaliation might take the form of removing its MPs from all
Commons committees. He said Labour would not take such a step because these
bodies were 'part of the work of parliament'.
Labour broke off all relations with the government in December in protest at
plans to curtail debate on bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay
and National Insurance contributions.
Under its protest even non-contentious legislation is being obstructed and
the practice of 'pairing' - whereby MPs can miss a vote by being linked to a
member in an opposing party who agrees to be absent as well  - has ended.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Demand for floorspace increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in demand from industrial companies has reduced the amount
of empty industrial floorspace for the first time since May 1989.
A survey by King Sturge, chartered surveyors, shows that the amount of
available industrial space fell by 1 per cent to 180.5m sq ft in the last
four months of 1993. It records a 60 per cent increase in inquiries from
potential tenants and buyers in 1993 compared with 1992.
The amount of available space has fluctuated sharply over the last 10 years.
The long economic upturn in the 1980s reduced supply from its 1983 peak of
177.61m sq ft to a low of 73.17m sq ft in May 1989. It then rose rapidly to
peak at 182.17m sq ft last September.
In spite of the generally positive findings of the survey, some parts of the
country continue to show increasing availability of property, albeit at a
declining rate. In southern England, only Greater London registered a fall
in availability, while East Anglia, the south-west and the rest of the the
south-east registered rises.
There were sharp decreases in the availability of industrial premises in
Wales, the Midlands and much of northern England, with the exception of the
north-west.
The survey says the availability of new buildings has fallen sharply by 2.3m
sq ft to 16.92m sq ft, which represents 9 per cent of total industrial
floorspace. This decline is attributed to the combination of improving
demand, coupled with continuing low levels of speculative construction.
The survey, conducted last December, covers buildings of more than 5,000 sq
ft. It excludes derelict property and that which is unsuitable for
refurbishment.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Private companies show more confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business confidence among medium-sized private companies is rising steadily,
according to a survey conducted by 3i, the venture capital group, Vanessa
Houlder writes.
The 3i Enterprise Barometer, which is based on 1,000 companies in the 3i
portfolio, has risen over each of the past four quarters to stand at its
highest level since the survey started in January 1988.
The balance of respondents believing that the business and political climate
is more favourable to starting a new business than it was a year ago has
increased to 52 percentage points. This was a sharp rise on the 35 points
recorded four months ago and is the highest balance since the survey started
in 1988.
The increased confidence is shared by companies operating throughout the
country, although those in the south are more positive.
The businesses are increasing their plans for investment, with 36 per cent
expecting an increase and only 15 per cent planning a cut.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Republicans' turn at the wheel: The next moves in the
Northern Ireland peace process depend on Sinn Fein and the IRA declaring
their hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasting peace - or the threat of descent into a paramilitary-led bloodbath?
With the British and Irish governments keeping up the pressure on Sinn Fein
and the IRA to declare their hand in the push for a 'new beginning', the
people of Northern Ireland await the next decisive turn of events in their
troubled history.
Try as they may to convince the republican movement that no group will be
allowed to hold to ransom those searching for progress in Northern Ireland,
both governments have to acknowledge that the movement also holds the key to
a real breakthrough.
Impatient politicians north and south refuse to set deadlines, although they
have been trying gently to push for a republican decision on the Downing
Street declaration by the time of Sinn Fein's annual conference in two
weeks. Yesterday, however, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, slapped
down the idea of an early response.
In Ulster there are those who believe that, whatever his movement does or
does not say in the short term, the historic tide has turned and that the
peace process is now unstoppable. But others invoke history to predict
failure and an unprecedented armed struggle.
But if Sinn Fein's holding position becomes untenable and it is forced into
making the next move, what are its options? If it were able to deliver an
unequivocal 'yes' to the joint declaration - regarded as the least likely
scenario by both governments - the immediate path ahead is clear. After a
three-month ceasefire, Sinn Fein can join an exploratory dialogue covering
security questions, participation in the political talks process and a start
to demilitarisation in the province.
But a 'yes' would require the British government to move quickly to reassure
moderate unionists - who have accepted but never endorsed the declaration -
that their position within the union remains secure. Their stance might
certainly be tested to breaking point as Sinn Fein paid its first official
call on Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. For its part, Dublin
would at once invite Sinn Fein to join the proposed all-Ireland Forum for
Peace and Reconciliation.
Mr Ian Paisley and his hardline Democratic Unionists would be even further
out on a limb, maintaining their boycott of the talks process and standing
aside from a 'treasonable sell-out'. The DUP is demanding that Mr John
Major, the prime minister, abandons the declaration, although its attempt
last week in a Belfast by-election to seek a mandate for its uncompromising
stand failed badly.
A more probable development, however, is that Sinn Fein might deliver
qualified acceptance of the declaration, perhaps involving a temporary
ceasefire. The gesture would switch the political initiative back to the two
governments, again casting Sinn Fein as the party set on the search for
peace and further probing any fault lines in the relationship between Dublin
and London.
Although both administrations have insisted that only a permanent ceasefire
will do, there have already been hints that Dublin might see a respite in
violence as sufficient grounds for allowing Sinn Fein to join the proposed
forum. Sinn Fein would then have prised open the door marked 'concessions' a
little further.
But if Sinn Fein, for the sake of retaining republican unity, says 'no',
Dublin - which has wanted the joint declaration to take priority over the
talks process until Sinn Fein declared its hand - will be obliged to join
London in pursuing the widest possible dialogue on the political way
forward. The Irish government has set itself firmly against a return to the
'the bad old days of Stormont domination'.
The unionists' priority will be for a devolved assembly along the lines set
out during the 'three-stranded' talks. Mr James Molyneux, the Ulster
Unionist leader, now says it could be up and running before the end of next
year. The Social Democratic and Labour party, however, is deeply suspicious
of what it can expect from an assembly. Sir Patrick and Mr John Hume, the
SDLP leader, would have to work hard on relationships between the people of
north and south in order to get the party to participate in a new chamber.
The chances of making much progress, however, against a background of
continuing violence might not be high.
But while the political options ahead are aired, it is the reaction of those
who have engaged in the tit-for-tat war of atrocities which is least
predictable and most critical.
Some believe that, if the latest initiative fails, the IRA will not be able
to return to the old levels of violence without alienating many republicans
brought to the brink of peace. 'They might be content to give people an
occasional reminder, maybe on the mainland, that they are still in
business', said one security source.
But another warned: 'Any IRA 'no' in the form of new atrocities will see the
loyalist paramilitaries go berserk. It could be the bloodiest year ever. And
if republican violence ends, will loyalists put away their own arms and
watch Sinn Fein at the negotiating table? They have their own agenda as
well'.
In spite of the talk of a security 'crackdown', the reality is that there
are no secret weapons in the security forces' locker and they know they must
be careful not to give the IRA any new opportunities for building fresh
support.
On Saturday, Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will meet
before watching the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham and declare
that the peace process continues. The reality will be that, off the pitch,
the waiting game goes on.

FT  14 FEB 94 / OECD meets in effort to fight bribery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officials from the 24 member countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development are to meet in Paris today and
tomorrow to seek common guidelines for clamping down on bribery and
corruption.
The industrialised OECD countries agree on the importance of stopping
bribery, as a way to improve governance in developing nations, but they
remain far apart on how binding a set of rules to adopt.
An OECD working group on illicit payments has produced a report containing a
list of possible anti-corruption measures. But the US and other countries
are at odds over the extent to which the OECD's recommendations should be a
fixed menu which members should adopt or a list from which they may select
measures.
The US will make another effort at the meeting this week for the
recommendation to be as binding as possible, requiring OECD members to make
bribery of another country's officials a criminal offence, and for it to
ensure that companies be not allowed to treat bribes paid abroad as
tax-deductible.
US officials are also seeking to establish a re-view mechanism to monitor
each country's implementation of the recommendations.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 makes the US the only country so
far to have criminalised bribery of another country's officials. Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, has complained that US companies are
losing vast sums because their competitors can win contracts by bribery.
Other OECD countries, however, have legal and constitutional concerns about
extending their criminal laws to offences in another country.
US officials point out that the UK, for example, had no such qualms in the
19th century about making it a crime for any British citizen to engage in
the slave trade. In modern times, Germany has moved against its citizens'
involvement in child pornography in Sri Lanka.
Some other countries, however, see a closer parallel in the controversial US
efforts to extend the reach of its environmental laws, for example by its
ban on the import of tuna caught in drift nets. The ban was condemned by a
panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
If agreement can be reached this week, an OECD recommendation could be
adopted this spring; if not, the argument may spill into the OECD
ministerial meeting in June.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Riding to the future on a Hong Kong Harley: Simon Holberton
meets a motor-cyclist from Harvard nicely placed in preparing a colonial
transition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Chu was warming to his subject. Looking down from the coffee shop of
the sumptuous American Club, atop the 49th floor of Exchange Square in
Central, he said: 'See that red car parked there - it's just to the left of
it.'
He was identifying his custom-made Harley Davidson motor-cycle, for which he
had paid nearly USDollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) last year. 'I have three
Harleys,' said Mr Chu, who describes himself as a 'small property
developer'. He was born in Shanghai, educated at Harvard and is a US
citizen. He is also one of the most important people in Hong Kong. With 29
other residents of the colony and 27 mainland officials, Mr Chu is a member
of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), an elite group appointed last
summer by Beijing to prepare for the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong in 1997.
'What the PWC is doing will have profound implications for the government of
Hong Kong after 1997,' said Mr Chu. 'Anyone interested in Hong Kong's future
should take a look at the PWC.'
He has a point. The only formal structure China had designed to manage the
last days of British rule is the Preparatory Committee, not due to come into
existence until 1996. Its main purpose is to select Hong Kong's chief
executive, the governor, and decide who will occupy to the top jobs in the
colony's civil service.
With the collapse in UK-Chinese co-operation over Hong Kong, Mr Chu says
Beijing has been forced to bring forward preparation for the takeover. This
was signalled by the formation of the PWC last summer. With the satisfaction
of a man who knows he is in the right place at the right time, Mr Chu said:
'We are providing the 'advice' for the Preparatory Committee.'
The committee's sub-groups now meet virtually every month in Beijing, while
the Hong Kong cohort meets at least as often in the colony. It has divided
itself into five sub-groups: political structure, economics, security and
social welfare, culture, and law.
When Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, meets Hong Kong advisers at the
beginning of next month, another cohort of PWC members might be announced.
Its membership is expected to grow, partly to counter the accusation that
the current Hong Kong group is made up of plutocrats currying favour with
the colony's future landlord, and partly to share the increasing workload.
The strategy of the UK's governor, Mr Chris Patten, over the committee has
been to question its legitimacy as a body representative of Hong Kong
opinion, and to deny its members access to the government and official
information.
Mr Chu admitted that, without the co-operation of the Hong Kong government,
the work of the PWC will be more difficult. He likened the enterprise to
flying a Boeing 747 without a pilot: 'We've got to borrow old manuals and
interview retired pilots. But I am fully confident that the 747 will take
off without problems.'
By contrast, while the colony's Legislative Council wrings its collective
hands over how to deal with Mr Patten's democracy legislation, the PWC works
on its alternative for Hong Kong post-Patten, This includes 'advice' on Hong
Kong citizens' travel documents, on the books their children will read in
school and on how they will elect representatives to LegCo.
LegCo will vote on the first stage of Mr Patten's democracy proposals this
month, probably February 23, and is expected to pass them unamended. Mr
Patten will then lob his second bill into the unsure hands of the colony's
legislators the following month.
Meanwhile, the PWC proceeds towards its July deadline for producing an
outline of Hong Kong's post-colonial political structure. On this issue, it
is fairly clear where the committee is heading.
It favours 'proportional' representation for the 20 LegCo seats meant to be
popularly elected, and small groups of voters for the 30 'functional'
constituencies which are to represent business and professional interests.
Mr Patten, though, advocates first-past-the-post elections for the popular
poll, and large groups of voters for the functional constituencies.
Mr Chu says proportional representation is the 'fairest' way to elect
politicians as it would give the 'fullest participation in the colony's
politics to individuals and parties'. Mr Patten demurs. Before he left for
Australia last week, he said proportional voting was meant to dilute the
strength of pro-democracy groups in LegCo.
Mr Chu says the aim of the committee is to stay close to the LegCo system
which existed before Mr Patten arrived in mid-1992. Pro-democracy advocates
such as Mr Martin Lee and Miss Emily Lau fail to understand that, in
opposing China, they will achieve nothing, Mr Chu says: 'I believe that, by
acting with finesse, we will get a better deal than by opposing Beijing.'
He is dismissive of suggestions that the PWC is an exercise in 'united
front' tactics by the Chinese Communist party, in spite of the deputy
director of the united front department of the party being a mainland member
of the PWC. 'Whether China is using united front tactics on me I don't care.
I'm concentrating on influencing China so that it does good things for Hong
Kong.'

FT  14 FEB 94 / Stagnation seen for Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government does not expect the economy to grow this year, but
is laying the groundwork for annual GDP growth of 4 to 5 per cent from 1995,
according to Mr Enzo del Bufalo, economic planning minister.
The government of President Rafael Caldera, which began a five-year term on
February 2, inherited a recession, high inflation and a large fiscal
deficit. The government views 1994 as 'a year of stabilisation', during
which it will curb government spending, introduce tax reforms, revive a
privatisation programme and streamline bureaucracy.
Mr Caldera has proposed a series of 'strategic' economic measures, including
'a battle against inflation', austerity in government spending, opening the
economy and greater competitiveness, efforts to control waste and
corruption, and a tax reform package. But the government has been short on
specifics, saying only that it will raise the minimum monthly wage from the
current level equivalent to Dollars 81 (Pounds 55) and drop an unpopular
value-added tax.
The government also plans to re-start the country's privatisation programme,
stalled since two failed military coups in 1992 plunged Venezuela into
political instability. The first step in reviving the programme is the sale
of a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, due in late March.
Venezuela's GDP last year showed a 1 per cent decline after three years of
strong growth. Inflation in 1993 reached 46 per cent and was 4.3 per cent
last month.
The leftist party, Radical Cause, has reiterated its call for the
dissolution of Venezuela's new Congress and the installation of a
constituent assembly. Congressman Pablo Medina of the party called the
Congress 'illegitimate' and 'fraudulent', claiming there was widespread
cheating in counting Congressional votes after elections in December.

Iran yesterday appointed a new head of radio and television in place of the

concession to conservative Moslem clerics, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
The Iranian news agency IRNA said supreme leader Ali Khamenei named Ali
Larijani as the TV and radio chief to replace Mohammad Hashemi, the
president's younger brother, who ran the broadcast organisation for 13
years. Mr Larijani is a relative hardliner who had been minister of Islamic
culture and guidance.

<TEXT>
Arab gunmen killed an Israeli secret policeman and wounded two others in an
ambush in the occupied West Bank yesterday, agencies report.
The Arabs sprayed automatic gunfire at a car carrying undercover agents of
Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service. The Israeli army said the
agents were on 'operational duty' in Ramallah.
The Israelis returned fire but the Arab gunmen escaped.
The attack was blamed on the military wing of Hamas, the Moslem
fundamentalist group, which opposes Israel's accord with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation for self-rule in Gaza and part of the West Bank.
Hamas has been blamed for most of the attacks on Israelis since the
agreement was signed last September.
In Gaza, meanwhile, Palestinians killed two Arabs they suspected of aiding
Israel. At least 10 Arabs have been killed as collaborators in as many days.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Clinton wins support from economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prominent economists, academics and business leaders have lent their support
to President Bill Clinton's strategy for opening the Japanese market. A
letter backing Mr Clinton's approach swiftly gathered more than 110 names
last week, symbolising the consensus - embracing even many traditional free
traders - that the US can no longer live with the US-Japan trade imbalance
or sign pacts that do not yield progress.
'There is a lot more resolve, unity and specificity,' said a senior US
official. 'Look at those figures. . . Dollars 60bn (trade deficit for 1993).
Plus we've learned a lot. . . You spend all those years on. . . talks, and
you don't have anything. That's why we are insisting on a specific
results-oriented approach.'
Past pacts have generated some gains, but they have often been limited.
Seven years after it was signed, a 1978 deal produced liberalisation of
Japan's government procurement computer market. Other talks led to greater
Japanese imports of tobacco, fish, beef and citrus fruits. In 1985, Tokyo
cut leather tariffs.
In 1986, a semiconductor agreement set 20 per cent as a minimum goal for the
opening of Japan's semiconductor market; thus far, however, this target has
been reached only once.
According to the Economic Strategy Institute, the impact of Japanese
policies is felt well beyond the US. Its surplus depresses world GDP 'by
upwards of Dollars 400bn (Pounds 274bn)' and destroys foreign jobs at a time
when unemployment is a severe problem. Japan's 'minimal' imports of high
value-added manufactured goods skew the composition of global economic
activity and threaten trade frictions everywhere.
While the US refused to agree to an empty arrangement for the sake of a
successful summit, its own proposals were vague. US officials said they
wanted - and Japan at the Tokyo summit agreed to - 'qualitative or
quantitative indicators' which would be used to measure progress in market
opening. There are no market share targets, and there would be no
enforcement mechanism in the agreement.
A senior trade official explained: 'A qualitative indicator is not
numerical. 'Quantitative' may and may not be numerical, although it is hard
to have a quantitative that doesn't have a number somewhere buried in it by
implication or direction.'
Japanese officials said what they rejected was 'numerical targets' and
'managed trade'.
US business representatives, who advised the trade officials, said they also
rejected managed trade. Ms Debra Waggoner, director of international trade
for the American Electronics Association, said the group sought indicators
comparing import penetration in Japan with third country markets, where the
US and Japan compete head to head. The AEA would measure growth of the
exports, the size of the markets and the competitiveness of the products.
'You set up benchmarks to see if you are making progress,' said Ms Waggoner.
'You want to see if something is amiss and if it is, you want to take the
necessary steps to get on track.'
A spokesman for the US car industry said: 'We are not asking for guaranteed
sales. Just give us the ability to sell.'
Whatever was meant, the US and Japan are on a collision course. Mr Clinton's
desired 'period of reflection' could end as early as tomorrow, when a review
of Japan's cellular telephone market is due. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, is said to have already requested a list of potential
targets for sanctions.
Beyond that are numerous trade cases to be filed or resurrected and
unsatisfactory agreements to be reviewed. Mr Kantor has stressed the
importance of trade pact enforcement to the credibility of the
administration; he will now have the opportunity to make good on his words.

FT  14 FEB 94 / International Press Review: Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Bosnian Serb forces surrounding Sarajevo needed any back-stiffening
as the Nato deadline to begin bombing them ticks away, their cousins in
neighbouring Serbia appear to be happy to oblige. After all, no one is, yet,
threatening to bomb Belgrade.
Thus Politika, the largest circulation Belgrade daily, which is close to the
Socialist party of President Slobodan Milosevic, said in a column called The
14th Threat: 'If we're counting correctly, this is the 14th threat to bomb
the Serbs. It's hard to believe that any action will start, even if those
responsible for taking such a decision can reach full agreement.'
Someone in the hills around the Bosnian capital must have read this before
deciding temporarily to stop Serbian guns being handed over to the UN
peacekeepers at the weekend.
'Nato has imposed this rusty institution of an ultimatum, overtaking the UN
and the clock has started ticking. What will happen after February 21?'
asked the newspaper. 'Even the Nato planners have no vision of what they'll
do after the first decisive step.'
Borba, the independent Belgrade daily, scuffled around for more neutral
territory, though it was careful not to alienate its more chauvinistic Serb
readers.
'It is naive to imagine that Nato's military machine cannot be stopped. At
the same time, it is unwise to think that this is merely a verbal
explosion,' an editorial said. 'If belligerent nationalists react noisily,
the risk of air strikes being implemented increases.
'We must praise the readiness of the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs to make
conciliatory arrangements quickly towards lifting the siege of Sarajevo.'
* * *
Fortunately for Serb morale, the big French daily, Le Figaro, takes an age
to get to Sarajevo. In Paris the Nato ultimatum has been greeted as ending
months of mounting frustration for France's UN blue helmets at their
powerlessness to stop the killing in Sarajevo, while reflecting satisfaction
at the central French role in orchestrating the military and diplomatic
moves.
Le Figaro noted with evident pleasure that 'for the first time for a long
time, it is France that has led the game. With President Mitterrand and
Prime Minister Balladur on the same wavelength, the foreign minister (Mr
Alain Juppe) was able to convince some, intimidate others, make alliances
and above all make a united stand with the US.'
But a writer on Liberation probably better reflected the cautious mood in
the rest of the continent. Just why was it that the west suddenly changed
tack after the mortar attack on the Sarajevo market? 'Why did we react to
the TV images of this attack more than to others? Because they were better
filmed? Bloodier? Because the presenter of ABC News was - at last] - in
Sarajevo to present it live? Or was it for a more sordid and arithmetical
reason? Because our stomachs could not swallow in one go 66 deaths and
nearly 200 wounded, even if over the past two years they have had no trouble
digesting nearly 10,000 victims in Sarajevo alone, but in smaller
mouthfuls?'
* * *
Italian commentators have applauded Nato's resolve. But since Italy houses
the principal bases from which air strikes will be mounted, they also worry
that possible Serb reactions could include air raids and sabotage.
Mr Indro Montanelli, the doyen of Italian journalists, warned in Corriera
della Sera the new policy contained two dangers. 'One is that intervention
occurs and leads to nothing, thus worsening the situation. Alternatively
there is no intervention and this inaction plays into the hands of those who
blame the west for being indifferent to the Bosnian tragedy.'
Mr Montanelli came down firmly against military intervention since it would
resolve none of the bitter ethnic problems that have torn apart
ex-Yugoslavia.
* * *
For the German press, the events of the past week in Bosnia, Brussels and
beyond raise more questions than answers.
'Can Nato bomb its way back to peace?' the left-wing Der Spiegel magazine
was asking yesterday.
'The west hopes to be able to bring the Serbs back to political reason,
without itself having any overall strategy for the new ethnic and political
order in Bosnia.
'If this risky game doesn't have an effect after the first air attacks, then
Europe will have to lift its arms embargo against the Moslems in order to
enable at least a marginal improvement in the arms balance.'
The other leading question was: who is most powerless in the entire sorry
story, the western allies, the UN, Russia, or the German government?
Unsurprisingly, Germany wins the prize from its own news media for the least
effective role.
'Just as on the eve of the Gulf war, Bonn is simply hoping that nothing
happens next week, and that the Serbs take the threats of the west
earnestly,' said the conservative Die Welt on Saturday.
Much of which makes the truculent scepticism at Politika in Belgrade sound
quite reasonable.

<TEXT>
Scientists yesterday reported significant promise in the century-long
struggle to develop a vaccine against malaria, Reuter reports from
Washington.
Malaria kills up to 1m children each year in Africa, and there are up to
500m cases of the disease each year globally. Moreover, the disease is
showing resistance to drugs traditionally used to treat it.
Scientists working for a special tropical disease programme jointly
sponsored by the UN Development Programme, the World Bank and the World
Health Organisation said a vaccine known as SPf66 has shown promising
results in the first phases of human trials in a region of Africa with
rampant malaria.
A final phase of human tests of the vaccine, under way in Tanzania, Gambia,
Colombia and Thailand, will determine whether SPf66 actually reduces the
number of malaria attacks. If those tests are successful, a vaccine could be
available for widespread use by 1998.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Plaudits pile up at home for hardline Hosokawa: In the face
of domestic recession, the sight of a Japan that can say No is a new and
welcome one in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The impasse between Japan and the US is unlikely to harm prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa's domestic political prospects. It might even improve
them.
Mr Hosokawa's clear denial of US demands and his refusal to cover up this
disagreement with an ambiguous communique marks a clear break with Japan's
previous attitude to its most important relationship.
This reflects the consensus that Japan should stand up to the US, a view
shared among his seven-party coalition and by the leadership of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party. As Mr Hosokawa said in Washington:
'Until now we refrained from speaking candidly and saying what was difficult
to say. In the past, Japan settled for ambiguous agreements with the United
States that later became a source of misunderstanding and generated pressure
from overseas. . . Now the bilateral relationship has turned into a mature
relationship, one among grown-ups, and I'm very gratified to achieve that,'
he said.
With Japan deep in recession and the US well into a recovery, Mr Hosokawa's
supporters would have found complete surrender to US trade demands all the
harder to understand. He won full support from Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade and
industry minister and a member of the Japan Renewal party, the main
influence on the coalition's economic policy. 'Japan and the US have entered
a stage to create a new relationship where one side is no longer subordinate
to the other,' said Mr Kumagai.
Even the LDP congratulated Mr Hosokawa for not caving in to US demands for
numerical targeted rises in import market share. 'To accept such targets
would mean abandoning the free trade principle and would go against the
drive for deregulation,' said Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president. Mr Kono's
support is less striking than its sounds, given Mr Hosokawa's increasing
habit of seeking joint positions with former LDP colleagues on vital
matters, as a buttress against the fragility of his own coalition.
As the reaction from Japan's business community over the weekend made clear,
nobody had in any case expected a US-Japan trade deal.
The failure to reach agreement was 'unavoidable', because Japan had 'stuck
to its policy of rejecting the US managed-trade-like approach', said Mr
Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Keidanren business federation. The
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association praised government negotiators
for not accepting numerical targets.
Japanese business and politics are however, worried about the possible costs
of Japan's new toughness, possible US trade sanctions and another rise in
the yen.
Accordingly, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary and one of
Mr Hosokawa's closest allies, called yesterday for further steps to 'open up
our market and increase domestic demand', without, of course, targets.
President Clinton's veiled threat to use the yen-dollar exchange rate as a
numerical target has already sent a worrying tremor through Japanese
business, in the shape of the Japanese currency's rise to a three-month high
against the dollar in New York on Friday.
An anxious Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers'
federation, said at the weekend the trade talks must continue. US trade
sanctions and talking up the yen 'would merely increase mutual distrust', he
warned.
The risk that Mr Clinton might succumb to pressure for trade sanctions
against Japan might also help Mr Hosokawa persuade entrenched bureaucratic
and industrial interests to drop their opposition to his drive to reduce the
more than 10,000 government regulations that choke economic activity. As so
many times in the past, US pressure still moves Japanese governments.
'Japan, which. . . for the first time said No to what it cannot do, must
implement what it can do as quickly as it can,' the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's
biggest circulation daily newspaper, advised Mr Hosokawa yesterday. The
prime minister must now 'take the initiative in resisting those forces that
resist reform', said the Yomiuri's editorial.

FT  14 FEB 94 / UK move to open US telecoms market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opening the US telecommunications market to British operators will test US
regulatory authorities in the coming weeks, and the outcome is likely to
have significant implications for access to the US market by other overseas
operators.
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, is seeking a waiver from
a restriction on foreign operators owning more than 25 per cent of a company
holding a radio-based licence in the US.
The waiver application, to the Federal Communications Commission, the US
telecoms regulator, is prompted by the prospect of licences being granted
nationwide for personal communications services (PCS), a new cellular mobile
technology.
More than 400 licences will be granted for franchise areas across the US.
The contest for licences will be fought fiercely among US telecoms
operators: more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) is expected to be raised by
the government in fees.
The FCC has discretion to issue a waiver and will judge the C&amp;W application
on its merits. The terms of its ruling are that the UK has placed no bar on
foreign ownership of licences for personal communications networks, the UK
equivalent of PCS. One network was launched last year, in which US West, US
regional Bell company, has a 50 per cent stake, with C&amp;W its partner.
A second PCN network is set to be launched in the UK in April by Hutchison
Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate.
Mr Keith Bernard, C&amp;W's director of regulatory affairs in Washington, said:
'We want the freedom to do what US companies are allowed to do in the UK, so
that we can integrate PCS into our existing networks in the US.'
The 25 per cent ceiling dates back to the first world war. It was imposed
for security reasons, but is now generally viewed as a protectionist device.
The FCC is likely to be guided by political considerations. Although some on
Capitol Hill have a record of hostility to overseas operators entering the
US, analysts believe the evidence of openness in the UK could lead to a
change of policy with regard to the UK.
The decision has wider ramifications. British Telecommunications is
currently seeking a licence to operate in the US in its own right, as is
AT&amp;T in the UK.
US regulators also have soon to decide whether to allow UK operators to
offer 'international simple resale' services to the UK, which would allow
companies to resell lines switched into the public network on both sides of
the Atlantic.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Record deficit for German export credit programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government's export credit insurance programme, Hermes, suffered
its worst ever deficit last year. The shortfall of DM5.1bn (Pounds 2bn) is
more than twice that of 1992 and is mainly due to DM4.5bn of losses on
high-risk business with the former Soviet Union.
The economics ministry said it might eventually recover some of the losses
if and when Russia and Germany agreed on a full-scale debt rescheduling. But
in the meantime the loss will be booked to Germany's public sector deficit.
Defending the decision to maintain its Hermes export insurance on exports to
Russia, despite the risks, the ministry said it had been necessary to help
businesses in the eastern part of Germany survive the collapse of
traditional markets in the former eastern bloc.
'Our continued coverage for the countries of the former Soviet Union has
made an important contribution to the maintenance of production and
employment in eastern Germany,' the ministry said.
It was in the government's interests to have healthy businesses in the east,
the ministry added, and the maintenance of the export credits via the Hermes
programme had helped companies gradually adapt to opportunities in western
markets while carrying on their trade with the former Soviet Union.
Last year, the government limited credit guarantees to Russia to DM5bn,
giving priority to east German exporters, a figure reduced further to
DM3.5bn for the current year.
The Hermes scheme, a key instrument of the German government's policy for
promoting exports, has produced a loss every year since 1982.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Italian parties jockey for poll positions
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's political parties are entering a decisive week to select candidates
and refine their alliances before parliament winds up for the general
election on March 27.
The need to allocate parliamentary seats will concentrate minds among party
leaders, who have so far focused on broad alliances and not yet grappled
with the details of the election campaign.
The jockeying for position among parties comes against the background of
growing controversy over the role of the judges leading investigations of
political corruption.
Politicians from the Northern League, which is expected to perform well in
the polls, have accused magistrates of political bias, or 'stop-watch
justice', in deliberately timing recent arrests to cause embarrassment to
some parties.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate-turned-politician who this month
launched his Forza Italia political movement, took pains on Saturday not to
attack the Milan magistrates who, on Friday, had ordered the arrest of his
brother Paolo for alleged corruption.
Speaking at Ancona, however, on the first step of a national tour to
popularise Forza Italia, Mr Berlusconi questioned the need for his brother's
formal arrest in that the latter had already indicated his readiness to
testify.
The message was amplified by commentators on Mr Berlusconi's three Fininvest
television channels, who implied at the weekend that the arrest may have
been politically motivated by left-wing magistrates seeking to embarrass
Forza Italia and its leader.
The right of the judiciary to investigate corruption, in spite of increasing
political sensitivity ahead of the election, was underlined by Mr Giovanni
Conso, the justice minister. However, he also warned judges to be
'scrupulous' and avoid the impression of political interference.
Support for the judiciary was echoed by Mr Giovanni Galloni, the deputy head
of the magistrates' self-regulating council. He said: 'It is up to every
politician and party to see that candidates under investigation should await
the conclusion of their cases before seeking re-election.'
The issue of re-election has focused on Mr Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian
Democratic former prime minister, who has been urged to stand again by
constituents in his political power base in the Avellino district, near
Naples.
In a separate development, indicating rising tension before the polls, Mr
Bettino Craxi, a former Socialist leader, filed charges with Rome
magistrates on Saturday against members of the Democratic Party of the Left,
the former Communists, for alleged corruption.
Mr Craxi's accusations came as Mr Sergio Cusani, the Milan financier on
trial for alleged handling of political bribes for the Ferruzzi-Montedison
industrial group, repeated allegations that it had paid L1bn (Pounds
400,000) to the former Communists to win support for special tax breaks for
the company.
In his first television interview, Mr Cusani also said he would arrange
today to hand over L20bn of the L35bn in alleged covert Ferruzzi funds he
controlled. The money, alleged to have been allocated for bribes to
politicians, is part of the L150bn which magistrates believe was put aside
by Ferruzzi to pay political bribes during the dissolution of the Enimont
chemicals joint venture.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising unemployment and poor short-term prospects for economic growth in
Europe will dominate the agenda when European Union finance ministers meet
in Brussels today.
Talks will focus on how to carry out prescriptions in the Delors White Paper
on employment and growth which were approved at the Brussels summit last
December.
Greece, which chairs the talks today, has pledged to make the White Paper
the centrepiece of its six-month presidency. But its efforts will be
complicated by the ideological faultline within the EU over how best to
generate growth and improve competitiveness.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to urge his
partners to follow the British model and improve labour market flexibility.
As in a recent speech in Paris, Mr Clarke will reject accusations that such
steps have undermined the UK welfare state.
But other member states remain wary of moves which could provoke labour
unrest at home. France, which has seen violent protests by fishermen,
farmers and airline workers in recent months, will point to its policy of
encouraging public and consumer spending to spur its faltering recovery.
The opening debate among ministers will be televised.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Call to open up European maze: Decision-making now too
complex for ordinary citizens to understand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Decision-making in the European Union has become so complex that it is
impossible for the ordinary citizen to understand, according to the EU's
senior lawyer in Brussels.
Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal service, says the
Maastricht treaty is partly to blame. New procedures and rules have turned
the EU into a 'veritable labyrinth'.
According to a paper circulating in Brussels, Mr Piris argues that reforms
under way, though useful, do not go far enough. 'In order to be genuinely
accepted and properly understood, the system ought to be profoundly reformed
one day, so as to move toward more transparency.'
Mr Piris was involved in drafting the Maastricht treaty. He also devised the
formula which allowed the Danish government to argue it had won legally
binding opt-outs, securing a decisive win in a second referendum last year.
Mr Piris concedes reform of decision-making will be difficult because it
implies a choice between those favouring deeper integration and those, such
as the UK, prefering looser inter-governmental co-operation.
The complex, opaque nature of decision-making in Brussels results from the
need to compromise between these forces, not because of anonymous 'diplomats
and technocrats' who took part in the Maastricht negotiations, he says.
Mr Piris suggests several reforms:
A 'single, shorter, more readable treaty' which would consolidate texts such
as the Treaty of Rome, Single European Act, Maastricht and others governing
EU operation. Clearer demarcation of areas of responsibility for Council,
Commission and Parliament, as well as between the Union and member states.
Modification of decision-making processes. Ministers involved in
decision-making must at present follow at least 20 different procedures
within Maastricht's framework.
Streamlining the way the EU acts and is represented abroad. This could mean
a seat for the EU at General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva
rather than separate national seats.
In his paper, Mr Piris argues strongly that the EU has done more to improve
efficiency, transparency, and democracy than first realised.
He points to new powers gained by the European Parliament for scrutinising
the European Commission; the creation of a European Ombudsman; publication
of the Commission's legislative programme in the Official Journal in
Brussels; and improved access to the public for official documents.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Traffic-linked bonds may fund EU roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is considering launching bonds tied to the volume of
road traffic as a way of raising money for its ambitious trans-European
networks initiative.
This would involve the Commission raising funds on international markets and
channelling finance to governments or private companies building roads
throughout the European Union. Investors would be paid interest linked to
the amount of traffic travelling along a particular road, said Mr Enrico
Cioffi, head of the Commission's investment directorate, in an interview.
The traffic-linked bond is one of several options being looked at by the
Commission as it tries to inject momentum into its trans-European networks
programme. This aims to develop transport, telecommunications and energy
networks linking different parts of the Union. The cost of priority projects
alone has been put at Ecu160bn (Pounds 121bn) by 1999.
The initiative received a qualified go-ahead from member states at last
December's summit in Brussels. While some countries were keen on the idea,
others such as Germany and the UK were hostile to the Commission proposals.
The Commission's ideas will be discussed in a group chaired by Mr Henning
Christophersen, the economics commissioner. They will then be put to June's
summit of European leaders in Corfu.
In an interview, Mr Christophersen said the problem was 'not so much a lack
of finance as a lack of appropriate financial instruments'.
Mr Cioffi said the aim of new instruments would be to 'reduce costs and add
value'. Alternatives being considered by the Commission included:
Bonds indexed to air, rail and maritime traffic. Interest payments could be
tied to traffic on a particular piece of infrastructure or to traffic
throughout the Union.
Bonds indexed to the interest rate of a particular central bank or a basket
of central bank interests rates.
Loan guarantees by the Commission. These would only be used for those parts
of a network located outside the Union and where the absence of a guarantee
would prevent the project going ahead. Examples could include
telecommunications or motorway networks extending from the Union into
eastern Europe.
Mr Cioffi said the Commission could use its AAA credit-rating to lower the
costs of infrastructure finance by between a half to one percentage point
for countries such as Greece, Italy, Ireland and Denmark, which do not have
AAA status. It could also reduce costs for private builders of
infrastructure.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Environment commissioner urges tax on timber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should introduce a tax on timber to reflect the
environmental cost of cutting down forests, according to Mr Ioannis
Paleokrassas, environment commissioner.
'Timber is a resource we could price more correctly,' he said. 'If we carry
on as we are, forests will be decimated.'
A timber tax would be graded according to the origin of the timber, he said
in London last week. Timber from old, native forests would be taxed more
heavily than that from replanted forests.
The tax would apply both to imports and to wood from Europe. He denied it
would conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
His comments drew a sharp response from Brazilian timber exporters. Mr Claes
Hall, European spokesman for Brazil's Cellulose Exporters Association
(Abecel), said: 'We grow timber in plantations like a crop - any tax should
recognise the difference between this and wood from native forests, and
plantation timber or products made from it should not be taxed.'
Finland's ministry of external economic relations said such a tax could
affect timber exports, though Finland believed it managed its forest better
than do many countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's prime minister, has called for early
elections and the resignation of two senior government members in a weekend
offensive against his opponents.
Fighting off opposition calls for his own resignation and the appointment of
a transitional government, Mr Meciar said a general election before the
summer would be 'the most honest solution' to the crisis dividing his
government. The last general election was in June 1992 and the next one is
not due until 1996.
Legislation, including an important new bill on privatisation, is blocked by
parliament, where the ruling coalition between the Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia (HZDS), led by Mr Meciar, and the right-wing Slovak National party
(SNS), is in a minority following defections.
Speaking after a special meeting of the HZDS national board on Saturday, Mr
Meciar called for the resignation of Mr Roman Kovac and Mr Jozef Moravcik,
respectively deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, following
their support for moves to replace the government by a broad coalition
including non-partisan experts. Both ministers are HZDS members. Mr Moravcik
said he would not resign.
The meeting was prompted by the creation last week of an Alternative of
Political Realism faction by 10 HZDS deputies opposed to Mr Meciar.
The prospect of an early general election was welcome by the left-wing Party
of the Democratic Left (SDL), successor to the former Communist party, which
is level with the HZDS in opinion polls.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Three weeks on, the super dinar is still working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quails' eggs, Italian ice cream and kiwi fruit have appeared again in
Belgrade supermarkets since the 'super dinar' was launched three weeks ago
as the beleaguered Yugoslav government's cure for hyper-inflation.
But the return of these tasty luxuries to the streets of the Serbian capital
is a cruel illusion. Only Belgrade's new rich, the profiteers who smuggle
petrol and other goods in defiance of UN sanctions against the rump
Yugoslavia, can afford them.
Despite the relief induced by a few weeks without inflation, the
government's chances of maintaining monetary stability, let alone
implementing measures that will revive the economy, appear slim.
The new dinar, fully convertible and equivalent to DM1, was introduced after
several months during which it was possible to measure Yugoslav inflation by
the hour and the D-Mark had come close to replacing the national currency.
Although the super-currency is backed up by only Dollars 150m (Pounds
102.7m) in hard currency reserves, according to the central bank, prices of
meat, milk and other staples plunged as goods hoarded by producers and
wholesalers flooded back into shops.
Old dinars are still circulating, but at just over 12m for one new dinar,
are so inconvenient to handle they are fast disappearing.
However, lower food prices have been offset by sharp increases in telephone
and electricity tariffs, while new taxes are making life difficult for small
businesses. Analysts warn that without curbs on public spending, including a
military budget which absorbs 7.6 per cent of outlays, the government's
attempts to increase revenues will have little impact on a widening deficit,
forecast to reach as much as 35 per cent of gross domestic product.
Prof Tomislav Popovic of the Institute of Economic Sciences believes
Belgrade's tenuous monetary stability will collapse in the next two months.
'Rising costs will be passed on to consumers and the government will have to
choose between facing social unrest, or printing more money and resuming the
inflationary cycle,' he says.
The first hint of trouble came last week when the Serb-led government
announced that the country's 1.3m pensioners would receive free food
packages this month but only 57 per cent of their normal pension payment.
With the average monthly salary now DM50 (Pounds 19.40), while pensions
average DM34 a month, most Yugoslav families must dig into their savings to
survive.
The cynical view is that the government is intent on absorbing most of an
estimated DM1.5bn still held by private savers in Serbia and Montenegro to
boost its hard currency reserves.
The central bank says foreign exchange reserves have risen by DM79m in the
past three weeks as foreign currency holdings have been converted into
dinars under the new system.
This is relatively slow progress, and the fact is that UN sanctions,
together with the war in Bosnia and the breakdown of tightly integrated
trade relations among the former Yugoslav republics, have brought the
official economy close to collapse.
Some 750,000 workers - 25 per cent of the workforce - are registered as
unemployed and 1.2m more are on paid leave. Gross domestic product, now only
a third of the 1990 level, is forecast to decline by at least 15 per cent
this year. After a 40 per cent drop in industrial output last year,
agriculture now accounts, officially, for more than 50 per cent of GDP.
However, the official figures may underestimate the size of the economy.
Prof Popovic estimates that the black economy, based on sanctions-breaking
and tax evasion by small businessmen, is equivalent to 33 per cent of GDP.

FT  14 FEB 94 / US move brings new hope for Bosnia talks: Presence of
Washington's negotiators may revive the Geneva peace process, say Nato
officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks in Sarajevo this week could change the pace and direction of efforts
for a settlement in Bosnia, when US diplomats put into effect Washington's
decision to play a greater role in seeking a negotiated settlement for
Bosnia.
Nato officials said this weekend that the presence of a team of US
negotiators in Sarajevo could change the nature of the Geneva peace process,
now that Washington - belatedly - has become actively involved and has
thrown its weight behind Nato air strikes on Serb artillery batteries around
the Bosnian capital.
'The problem with the Geneva negotiations is that they failed to motivate
all three sides sufficiently to make them all sign up to a peace agreement,'
another Nato diplomat said.
'The threat of the use of force, which is real for once, and other elements
on the ground could really move along these talks.'
The current peace plan, drawn up by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
envisages dividing Bosnia into three ethnic states, nominally within a
republic of Bosnia. In practice, it would link Serb- and Croat-controlled
areas with their respective patron republics, leaving the Bosnian Moslem
statelet vulnerable and sandwiched between two hostile states.
US officials, however, are unwilling to reveal what plan they will put on
the table in Geneva when the talks reconvene at the end of this month.
'This process (in Geneva) has made a lot of progress. But it has not been
able to bring it to a close, even though the negotiators keep saying the
differences are very narrow.
'If so, why the delay? The Americans will try to stimulate the process in a
different way that could get us to the end of the road,' a diplomat said.
In becoming more engaged at Geneva, the US wants to establish 'what is the
Bosnian government's bottom line' for accepting peace; work out how to
cement, or at least improve relations between Croatia and Bosnia,
particularly in western Hercegovina; and establish at what price President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia would make more concessions in order to have
sanctions lifted.
Nato diplomats believe the Bosnians could accept peace if they knew that the
territory they will control will be ethnically homogenous, will have access
to the sea, and will be backed by an economic reconstruction programme.
'Let's be clear. If the Bosnians are forced to sign, there will be no
lasting peace. Also, the US will not twist their arm to accept the present
plan. That will not bring a lasting peace,' a Nato diplomat said.
The Croatians, who before the Bosnia war supported Serbia's carve-up of the
republic between Belgrade and Zagreb, are slowly shifting their ground. In
Geneva last week, Croats and Bosnians discussed securing stability in
western Hercegovina, especially in Mostar, the regional capital.
The city, which never received the attention that Sarajevo did, is almost
rubble in the wake of Croat shelling, while in central Bosnia, also off the
main headlines, scores of people are killed each day in clashes between
Bosnian and Croat forces.
'The Croats know we are approaching the end-game, but this time from the
western angle not the Serbian side. We are prepared to slap sanctions on
them. They have gotten away with too much,' the Nato official said. He added
that President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, an ally of Mr Milosevic, is now
supporting the Nato strikes.
'The Croats are fickle. They back the winning side. They know the US could
push for sanctions,' he added.
Yet the US knows it is Mr Milosevic who can, with the crucial support of
some hardliners on the ground in Sarajevo, hold the key to peace.
'Milosevic wants those sanctions lifted. The US is here now to motivate all
the sides. We don't have a timetable. But one thing is sure. This war cannot
be won militarily. . . it has got to take advantage of what Nato has done.
But to stop the suffering, all of them are going to have to find a
negotiated political solution. That's the US message,' the diplomat said.
But Nato diplomats admit that even if the threat of the Nato ultimatum can
put pressure on the Geneva talks to reach an eventual settlement, it will be
difficult for the three sides to trust one another, either at the
negotiating table or on the ground.
'Each side has become so radicalised, and the Bosnians often feel they were
being treated the same, as if they were equally to blame for the war at
Geneva,' a Nato diplomat said. He said the US would 'try to promote trust'
among the Bosnian delegation, and the other two sides.
'It won't be easy,' he continued. 'But by having having the US on board, all
three sides will realise that behind that presence is Nato. That could well
speed up the negotiations. But nobody lays hostage to fortune in these
talks.'

FT  14 FEB 94 / Slow progress towards Serb withdrawal from besieged capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western efforts to secure withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces from around the
besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo before the Nato deadline next Sunday
are progressing in fits and starts, Judy Dempsey writes.
For most of yesterday, Serb forces stopped handing over their heavy
artillery pieces to United Nations military personnel. General Manojlo
Milovanovic, chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, said the process had
come to a halt. The UN forces had failed to take corresponding measures
against the Bosnian forces, he added.
But, late yesterday afternoon, UN officials said Serbian co-operation had
re-started and they reported that 13 artillery pieces had been handed over.
This is a trickle, however. Hundreds of long-range weapons remain to be
surrendered if the 22-month siege of Sarajevo is to be lifted peacefully.
As a measure of what UN negotiators around Sarajevo might have to face in
coming days, Gen Milovanovic said the UN was failing to disarm, or
neutralise the Bosnian (Moslem) infantry, which he said outnumbered Serb
forces. The Bosnian infantry is lightly armed but increasingly organised.
It has succeeded in defending the city, as well as in making territorial
gains in central Bosnia.
Gen Milovanovic told reporters at Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters: 'The
UN was unable to secure control of the Moslem infantry. Therefore, I did not
allow the withdrawal or control of the Serbian artillery.' The UN had asked
the Serb forces to hand in about 20 heavy artillery pieces.
The general had earlier told Politika, the Belgrade daily, his forces would
be able to shoot down Nato aircraft.
UN officials in Sarajevo are concerned that Bosnian forces might provoke the
Serbs into breaking the ceasefire, and thus prevent the delivery of heavy
weapons to UN control. Admiral Jeffrey Boorda, Nato's southern European
commander, insisted that all heavy weapons should be withdrawn from around
Sarajevo, adding that the Nato ultimatum was not directly exclusively at the
Serbs.
The British general commanding UN peacekeepers in Bosnia, Gen Sir Michael
Rose, insisted demilitarisation of Sarajevo was still on track. He also said
the Bosnians were trying to provoke the Serbs, implying that forces loyal to
the Moslem-led government wanted to precipitate air strikes.
Hina, Croatia's state-run news agency, yesterday reported heavy clashes
between Bosnian and Croat forces around Vitez in central Bosnia.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Lloyd's braced for failure of Pounds 900m offer to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is resigned to almost certain failure today in its efforts
to reach an out-of-court settlement to legal action involving more than
17,000 Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the
insurance market.
This afternoon is the deadline for loss-making Names to accept a Pounds 900m
offer.
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, acknowledged yesterday: 'Unless
something very dramatic happens on Monday we'll be short of the value
take-up which will enable us to go unconditional with the offer.'
Lloyd's has said that at least 70 per cent of the value of the offer will
have to be taken up by Names if the deal is to be implemented. It is also
unlikely that Lloyd's will decide to extend the deadline to give Names more
time to accept the deal, in spite of an increase in the number of
acceptances in the past few days, Mr Middleton said.
If the offer fails, legal actions are likely to begin, starting with one by
3,000 Gooda Walker Names that is scheduled to come to court in April.
Mr Middleton is hopeful that negotiations about a possible out-of-court
settlement will eventually be resumed, although he emphasised that this was
unlikely to happen before September or October.
He said: 'I can't see this offer being revived. But that is not to say that
there will not be a set of circumstances where people begin to talk.'
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker action group, stressed that
his group's action would have continued irrespective of how many Names had
sent in their acceptance forms.
He said: 'I think we have a period of litigation which will be conducted in
a very determined fashion by both sides.'
Lloyd's would not play a central role in organising any future talks, which
would be dependent on initiatives by Names or errors and omissions
underwriters.
It is understood that E&amp;O underwriters had agreed to contribute about Pounds
400m to the Pounds 900m settlement offer, with Lloyd's contributing a
further Pounds 450m from its central fund - which meets claims when Names
are unable to fulfil their obligations. Agents would have contributed a
further Pounds 50m to the deal.
Meanwhile, Mr Middleton said the market's key priorities 'must be further
reforms'. At the top of the agenda are efforts to create NewCo, a
reinsurance company.

FT  14 FEB 94 / US may use sanctions over Japan trade rift
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US will begin a review today of trade and economic measures that might
be used against Japan in the wake of the failure of Friday's bilateral
summit to resolve differences over how to secure greater US access to
Japanese markets.
After a farewell breakfast with President Bill Clinton on Saturday, Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, warned the US not to impose
trade sanctions. His aides hinted that Japan would take the US to Gatt or
take retaliatory measures of its own in the event of excessive US action.
A US official said the administration would be 'clobbered' in Congress and
by business if it did not respond. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, will undertake the initial review.
The first concrete US response may come tomorrow when Mr Kantor's office is
to pass judgment on a complaint from Motorola that Japan has not lived up to
the terms of the 1989 agreement granting the company greater access for its
cellular phones in the main urban corridor from Tokyo to Osaka.
Other options under consideration include Mr Clinton invoking, by executive
order, the 'Super 301' provisions of US trade law. Under 'Super 301',
countries deemed systematically to discriminate against US goods and
services are identified by name, setting in motion a process that can lead
to sanctions.
The US is also expected to keep the pressure on Japan to further stimulate
its economy. It may also seek to drive the yen upwards. On Friday Mr Clinton
had included the exchange rate as one of the 'objective criteria' the US
wanted applied.
Both leaders went out of their way on Saturday to emphasise that in matters
other than trade the relationship was in good shape.
There were domestic political plaudits for both leaders from Friday's
failure. Mr Hosokawa returned home yesterday to general support for his
tough line against numerical targets for US imports' share of the Japanese
market, while Mr Clinton heard a prominent critic, Senator Robert Dole, the
Republican leader, commend him for not settling for a 'bad agreement'. He
predicted 'a breather' before the US acted, using existing statutory powers.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, Nikkeiren employers' federation chairman, urged both
countries to 'continue their dialogue from the viewpoint that the US-Japan
relationship is the most important bilateral relation for both countries'.
Mr Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce, hoped the US
would show 'good sense', while the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association also hoped the US would not resort to sanctions.
But Mr Hosokawa will also come under pressure to stimulate domestic demand,
on top of last week's Y15,250bn (Pounds 94.6bn) pump-priming package, to
increase Japanese demand for imports.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and one of Mr Hosokawa's
closest political allies, said: 'On our own initiative, we should draft
plans to further open our market and increase domestic demand.' The
opposition Liberal Democratic party also welcomed Mr Hosokawa's rejection of
US demands.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Russia faces population crisis as death rate soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is facing a double population crisis - a dramatic rise in death rates
and a sharp fall in the birth rate, according to official figures which have
largely been kept hidden from public debate.
In the past year alone, the death rate jumped 20 per cent, or 360,000 deaths
more than in 1992. Researchers now believe that the average age for male
mortality in Russia has sunk to 59 - far below the average in the
industrialised world and the lowest in Russia since the early 1960s.
The results, which have been a matter of close concern at the level of
Russia's National Security Council, are only now trickling out. Some were
given at a conference last week at the New York Harriman Institute by Ms
Natalia Rimashevskaya, head of the Institute for Socio-Economic Studies of
the Population, while further research into the figures has been done by Ms
Judith Shapiro, a British academic working with the macroeconomic and
finance unit which was attached to the Russian finance ministry until last
month.
Ms Rimashevskaya's findings showed, she said, an 'unprecedented' rise in the
death rate, with much of the increase due to 'killings, suicides and
conflicts'. However, infant mortality had also gone up sharply, from 17.4 in
1,000 in 1990 to 19.1 in 1,000 last year.
The average age of death (for men and women) was now, she said, 'at 66 or
lower' - the same level as in the early to mid-1960s and four or five years
below the figure that had been achieved more recently. In 1993, 1.4m people
were born and 2.2m died - although inward migration of Russians from former
Soviet republics compensated to some extent, bringing the net fall in
population to 500,000 last year.
Ms Shapiro's findings, based like Ms Rimashevskaya's on figures from the
state statistical committee Goskomstat, which have had very limited
availability, show men to be the main victims of earlier deaths. The average
death rate has been brought down to 59, she says, largely through two causes
 -a higher rate of coronary disease and strokes, and more violent deaths.
Of the total of 360,000 extra deaths in 1993, nearly 50 per cent were from
heart and circulatory failure and more than 25 per cent were from violent
causes.
Ms Shapiro says that simple poverty, and the state of the post-Soviet health
service, are probably minor causes of the phenomenon. More significant is
what she calls a 'psycho-social crisis' with greatly rising insecurity.
Ms Rimashevskaya says the decline of births is partly due to a simple
shortage of women - but more because women of child-bearing age postpone
having children or decide not to give birth 'because of the poor situation
in the society'.

FT  14 FEB 94 / Inkatha to boycott S African poll: Alliance of rightwing
blacks and whites threatens viability of election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said at the weekend it had decided to
join white rightwing parties in opposing South Africa's April elections. The
decision increases the threat of election-related violence and raises doubts
about whether a poll can be conducted nationwide.
Inkatha called on its supporters to boycott the poll and to campaign with
the conservative Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) to ensure
it is cancelled.
Both Inkatha and the AVF were careful to avoid an overt call to violent
resistance - Inkatha said it would use only legal methods to oppose the poll
and the AVF said it would 'give priority to peaceful means'. But Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, warned that the boycott might bring
death and bloodshed.
'It is impossible for me to lie to you and reassure you that the IFP
opposition to fighting the elections under the present constitution will not
bring casualties and even death,' the Zulu leader told about 10,000
supporters. He called on them to set up self-defence units.
'If we do not defend our people, no one else will. We must defend our
communities with all our might. We must defend and fight back. We must
resist the African National Congress and their communist surrogates,' he
said.
The three groups in the rightwing Freedom Alliance - Inkatha, the AVF and
the black homeland of Bophuthatswana - allowed a weekend deadline to pass
without registering to participate in the election, to be held on April
26-28.
Both the government and the ANC said parties could register even after the
deadline, but only if progress is made in constitutional negotiations.
Meanwhile Mr Kobie Coetsee, defence minister, said South Africa's defence
force was taking measures to meed a threat from the white right, adding that
the force had withdrawn a large number of weapons issued to white part-time
soldiers who had 'abused' them.
Inkatha said it remained committed to negotiation and called for
international mediation to break the deadlock. But Inkatha officials made
clear that the KwaZulu government, which Chief Buthelezi heads, would not
allow polling booths to be set up in the homeland.
This puts KwaZulu on a collision course with the central government which
said it would use 'physical force' to ensure the election takes place.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Eight groups hope to be a lucky winner: The companies
bidding for the right to run the National Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the biggest sweepstakes in British history gets under way on Monday -
the battle for the right to run the National Lottery, an enterprise that
could become a Pounds 4bn-a-year business.
So far eight runners have publicly declared themselves although at least two
other potential bidders have sent letters of intent to the National Lottery
Office.
Mr Richard Branson is expected to deliver the bid from his non-profitmaking
UK Lottery Foundation with the help of Desert Orchid, the racehorse.
The National Lottery's director-general, Mr Peter Davis, who must make the
choice, already feels lucky.
'I think we are going to have a number of really good applications which
means that there is real competition and a good result for the good causes,'
said Mr Davis.
About 50 per cent of the National Lottery revenues are expected to go on
prizes - including a top prize that could be more than Pounds 5m a week.
Twelve per cent will go in tax and between 15 per cent and 17 per cent on
total operating costs of which between 2 per cent and 3 per cent could be
profit for the operator.
The rest, which could approach Pounds 1bn when the lottery is mature, will
be split equally between the arts, charities, national heritage, a fund to
mark the millenium, and sport.
Mr Davis's decision - once he is satisfied of each bidder's probity,
security, taste and viability - could turn on fractions of percentage points
of overall revenue going to the good causes.
Ask the bidders themselves who they believe their main rivals are and the
two names mentioned most frequently are Camelot and the Rank Organisation.
Camelot, run by Mr Tim Holly, brings together five companies with relevant
experience - Cadbury Schweppes, to find the retail outlets, De La Rue, the
security printers, ICL, which will provide computer terminals, Racal, the
network management company and G-Tech, the lottery equipment company.
In contrast, Mr Michael Gifford at the Rank Organisation is running his bid
in-house and pulling in his services - including Automated Wagering
International of the US, the main G-Tech rival - by competitive tender. The
single-company approach and Rank's casino interests may be controversial.
Three other names are mentioned as threats by their rivals - The Great
British Lottery Company, Games For Good Causes and the NM
Rothschild/Tattersalls consortium.
The approach of The Great British Lottery Company - Granada, Associated
Newspapers, Hambros, Carlton Communications and Vodafone in partnership with
AWI - is remarkably similar to that of Camelot. GBLC will probably have
already spent Pounds 2m on its bid by Monday.
Games for Good Causes - run by Mr Malcom Hughes, former managing director of
Vernons Pools - brings together Ladbroke and MAI, the television and
financial services group. One third of the equity will be provided by
institutions. It is unclear whether the Ladbroke connection will help or
hinder.
Rothschilds and Tattersalls, for the moment a 50-50 joint venture, although
a lot of institutional support is already in place, is a dark horse that
could come through. With the backing of Rothschilds the business plan should
add up and Tattersalls of Australia has a long record in lotteries.
The orthodox businesspeople in the other consortia tend to underrate the
threat posed by The Richard Branson-Lord Young UK Lottery Foundation, which
plans to give all its profits to charity. They admire Mr Branson's flair for
publicity and have had to shave a little extra off their profits and offer
more to good causes - just in case. With IBM putting its name behind the
foundation as technology partner the bid cannot be dismissed as hot air.
It is particularly difficult to put any odds on the bid from The Tote, the
pooled on-course betting organisation backed by Lord Weinstock and GEC and
Thorn EMI. There is betting experience and industrial muscle, but rivals
place it down the field.
Rainbow, the consortium chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BTR,
has in effect ruled itself out as contender for the main operating
licence by announcing it was only interested in the off-line part of the
lottery - scratch cards. The winner might like to talk to Rainbow about
sub-contracting some of its scratch-card operations.

The pepper market was more active this week as more buyers tried to cover
neglected positions, reports Man Producten. White pepper remained very
steady. Selling pressure was limited because of the Chinese year. Spot white
was quoted at USDollars 2,900 a tonne and nearby shipment at Dollars 2,750
cif. Black pepper prices continued to rise as reports from India indicated
that the new crop was even worse than expected. It remains to be seen
whether there will be much pepper left for export purposes because India's
consumption must be at least 30.000 tonnes and the crop may fall short by
some 40.000 tonnes. In response to the Indian situation other producers
increased their prices or withdrew completely. Spot black No. 1 was offered
at Dollars 1,600-Dollars 1,650 a tonne, with forward positiomns commanding
premiums.

FT  12 FEB 94 / City jitters greet Clarke's cut in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's the first mistake Clarke has made,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, currency
strategist at Swiss Bank Corporation. The rest of the City seems to feel the
same about Tuesday's quarter-point cut in interest rates.
Not only has the FT-SE 100 share index ended the week 40 points lower than
before the cut, but the pound has lost more than three cents against the
dollar and four pfennigs against the D-Mark, and gilts are down three
points.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may be riding high in the opinion of Tory
backbenchers. But after a tax-raising Budget that delighted the markets, the
City has this week lost some of its confidence.
Mr O'Neill added: 'We're all entitled to one (mistake), but it undermines
the idea that he and Eddie (George, governor of the Bank of England) have
got it all worked out.'
Mr Derek Scott of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Eddie George and Ken Clarke
do not have the credibility of Alan Greenspan (the chairman of the US
Federal Reserve). It all depends now on whether Clarke will take pre-emptive
action to stamp out inflation.'
The cut, which came hard on the heels of inflation-beating pay rises of
about 3 per cent for public-sector workers, raised fears that Mr Clarke's
overriding priority was no longer to get inflation down but to go for
recovery - both in the economy and the government's popularity. The City
remembers all too clearly that Mr Clarke came to the Treasury expressing
concern about manufacturing, the unemployed and Britain's role in Europe.
But if the City is jittery, Tory backbenchers are more confident about his
stewardship of the economy - whatever they feel about his politics.
Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil
service committee, said yesterday that the Budget statement was 'about
right' and well- presented. Like many at Westminster, he admires the
chancellor's direct style. But Mr Watts is also concerned about the
chancellor's approach - he can occasionally 'charge into a room and drop a
scatter-grenade', said Mr Watts.
He believes the chancellor was unwise to tell a recent meeting of his
committee that the Budget had put an additional 7p on income tax. It played
into the hands of the opposition, he said.
Mr Clarke may have made a more serious blunder by recently admitting on
television that he would resign if Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the
sale of arms to Iraq finds that he had acted improperly as a minister in the
late 1980s.
On the right of the party, Mr Clarke attracts criticism from those who who
see him as the main challenger to Mr Major from the left.
What this week makes clear, however, is that the markets are too concerned
about Mr Clarke's macroeconomic strategy now to start worrying about his
departure.

The board said that when the plan was approved farmers would have two weeks

FT  12 FEB 94 / Ellington pit votes to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners at Ellington colliery in Northumberland, the last pit in north-east
England, yesterday voted to accept closure, reversing their decision last
weekend to put the mine into the industry's colliery review procedure.
Union officials, who had recommended fighting the closure, said they were
disappointed, but understood the men's decision against a background of deep
uncertainty, mistrust of British Coal and high local unemployment.
The redundancy package on offer to the 1,100 Ellington employees, worth up
to Pounds 47,000 for the longest serving, includes a Pounds 7,000 bonus
offered by British Coal since mid-1993 at pits where it was seeking
immediate closure, plus a further Pounds 3,000 top up offered at five pits
named for closure since the start of 1994.
'At the end of the day they were bribed out,' said Mr Ian Lavery, Ellington
NUM lodge secretary. Production stopped yesterday at the pit. British Coal
has yet to decide when its pit ponies, Britain's last, will be brought to
the surface.
Mining unions plan to meet British Alcan, whose adjacent aluminium smelter
is Ellington's main customer, to discuss the chance that the company may bid
for the pit in a joint venture with Ryan Group.
Seven hundred miners at Ollerton colliery and a further 700 at Annesley
colliery, both in Nottinghamshire, also voted yesterday to accept closure.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Lesourne yesterday resigned as managing editor of Le Monde, the
influential French daily newspaper, after a long-running row over the
paper's gloomy financial prospects and its future strategy, writes Alice
Rawsthorn from Paris.
Le Monde, like the rest of the French press, has recently come under intense
financial pressure because of the economic recession and the instability
caused by the recent reform of the advertising space buying system.
Mr Lesourne, who was elected managing editor for five years in 1991, had
been trying to cut costs at the paper. However he announced last week that
Le Monde had fallen into the red in 1993 after mustering a negligible profit
of FFr1.3m (Pounds 149,000) in 1992.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Milligan, is there need for remorse?: Dominic Lawson
explains why he'd rather not know the details of an MP's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are some things I would rather not know. I would rather not know the
circumstances of the death of Stephen Milligan MP. Like most people, I do
not feel ennobled by the knowledge of the exact method of his accidental
suicide, as described in lurid detail by radio and television.
But at the same time there is something compelling about the experience,
this receipt of illicit and formerly forbidden information.
The pulse races, the heart-beat quickens. Somehow one is drawn into the
newsagents, and in a husky and embarrassed voice, one asks for a copy of The
Sun, to be tucked inside one's copy of the FT, later to be read at home and
in private.
Perhaps it was not such a thrilling experience for Stephen Milligan's family
to hear of the bizarre circumstances of his body's discovery, on the news
programmes, even before the police had informed them of his death.
Paul Condon, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has, to his credit,
immediately made the circumstances of this leak of information the subject
of an internal inquiry.
We can be certain that the police inquiry will exonerate all the officers
involved, not because such a breach of professional ethics did not occur,
but because the professional ethics of the journalists will prevent them
from revealing their sources.
Last week I spoke to someone with detailed professional acquaintance of the
police force. He seemed remarkably unsurprised by the suggestion that the
members of the force had leaked details of Milligan's death - well before
the completion of police inquiries - to the media.
A former army man, he fulminated about the lack of an officer class in the
police force, and, as he saw it, the consequent inability of senior officers
to impose satisfactory standards of behaviour on the lower ranks. He
believed it was almost commonplace for members of those lower ranks to sell
information to the tabloid press.
Two weeks ago I wrote about the case of Gillian Taylforth, in which The Sun
newspaper was unsuccessfully sued by the actress for claiming that the
police had discovered her fellating her lover in a lay by. The Sun's first
line of defence was that the event took place. Its second line of defence
was that it was merely passing on information given to it - quite improperly
 -by the police. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how else The Sun could have
been so sure of its information as to risk publication.
Last year it was widely alleged that the police had tipped off the press
about the timing of its arrest, on fraud charges, of Kevin and Ian Maxwell.
It was, to say the least, surprising that not a single tabloid newspaper
missed its 5.30am appointment outside the homes of the two men. Naturally
the Serious Fraud Office conducted an internal inquiry into this incident,
and naturally it found that it had acted irreproachably.
I, fortunately, have had no first hand experience of the police's conduct in
such matters; but I do know of one celebrated criminal from whose home the
police removed - doubtless for their collection of evidence - several family
photographs. These subsequently appeared in a tabloid newspaper during the
man's trial, and before they were returned to his wife.
The newspapers will quite reasonably claim, in the case of Stephen Milligan
and others, that they are merely feeding the public's interest, and that it
is up to the police force to keep its own house in order.
And it is true that the events of the past few days have enlightened us to a
widespread form of perverted pleasure which had hitherto been little
commented on; that millions of us will pay money to read as much as we can
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.
But, as I am sure any newspaper medical correspondent will tell us, we
should not feel too ashamed of this perversion, and it is quite possible for
us to lead an outwardly normal and successful life, while indulging in such
depravity. It would be quite wrong for any of the participants in this act,
the police force, the newspaper editors, and the paying public, to feel the
slightest degree of guilt or remorse.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Private View: The unseen eye of a most modest writer -
Norman Lewis is worshipped by his readers, yet is never really the hero of
the extraordinary stories he has to tell. He is satisfied producing
'revealing little descriptions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man of his reputation, in an age when publishers are more concerned to
push the personality of their authors than to defend the quality of their
books, Norman Lewis shows a shocking lack of self-promotion.
His readers worship him and Graham Greene called him one of the best writers
of this century. Yet, he looks and sounds more like a solicitor's clerk from
the suburbs, a person so nondescript as to be guaranteed escape from any
identity parade.
In manner, he is as modest as in appearance. Arriving in London from his
house in the Essex countryside, he spoke of the pleasure and excitement of a
trip to the city as if he had never visited the metropolis in his life, let
alone tramped through the wilds of Indochina, Indonesia and Latin America
for the past 50 years and more.
When I asked if he regretted being known better for his travel books than
his novels, he said merely: 'Probably. On the other hand, I regard myself as
unambitious. I lead, in my opinion, an ideal style of life. If I'm happy
with it, it's satisfactory. I'm not an ambitious person.
'It's very, very nice indeed to make a few friends to talk about things and
to earn their respect as a writer - that's marvellous. But, for the public
in general, I just don't care at all. I get by and that's fine.'
If Norman Lewis worries and suffers as much as other men, you would not
guess it. Humorous, accommodating, unfashionably respectful, he talks
happily about his adventures, yet is never really the hero of the
extraordinary stories he has to tell.
His is the unseen eye. And this surely is the secret of literary alchemy:
Lewis combines extraordinarily sharp eyes and ears with a gluttonous
curiosity and a long memory. But he filters out the intrusive presence of
the observer - himself.
'I am really entranced by the world in all its aspects,' he said. 'And I
cannot tell you the joy that it gives me to study it, to try to analyse why
I like it so much and to write little bits of description on the spot:
because if I leave it 10 minutes, it's lost - less than that, before I get
out of the door.
'All my notes are written on scraps of paper, which I immediately lose. I
get immense enjoyment from it. This is my life, really, the enjoyment of
producing what I think to be a revealing little description . . .'
He quoted, with apparent approval, the complaint of one critic that his
novels read like travel books, and of another that some of his travel
writing reads like fiction.
It is no surprise to learn that Lewis, although he always saw himself as an
author, first earned his living as a photographer. Many of his 'little
descriptions' have a photographic exactness about them.
He does not make the mistake of trying to capture the whole picture,
however; he concentrates, like a painter, on the most telling details of his
subject or scene.
His observations can be truly minute. To take a random example: a scene from
Voices of the Old Sea, about the primitive fishing village in Catalonia
where Lewis lived for three years after the second world war. It is early,
and the author is taking coffee with Don Alberto, the local landowner:
'. . . Don Alberto took a sip, leaving a small, vivacious stain on the cup's
rim. He gasped his appreciation, then re-arranged the cup, saucer and spoon
for a better display of the treacly morning reflections.'
In Naples '44 the writer's talent for pen portraiture gets full rein. Lewis
was serving as lowly, but hard-working and resourceful, intelligence officer
in the chaos of the city's occupation by the Allies. His journal of those
months records the tragi-comic antics of black marketeers, currupt mayors,
distressed contessas and wide-eyed prostitutes.
Lewis revealed a passion for the exotic early on. His first wife was the
wilful, arresting Ernestina Corvaja, daughter of a minor Italian mafioso
living in London.
In his autobiography, Jackdaw Cake, Lewis describes how Ernestina flouted
her father, Ernesto, by announcing their betrothal as an accomplished fact.
The astonished father went grey with shock, then . . .
'Suddenly Ernesto shook his head - as if to free himself from a web clinging
to his face. He straightened and smiled at me, a little wolfishly, I
thought.
'What I was witnessing was a classic example of the stoic Sicilian reaction
to irretrievable calamity, known in their enigmatic island as 'swallowing
the claws of the toad'.'
Lewis grew fond of Ernesto. Ernestina drifted away to Guatemala, though. 'It
was a mistake, but it didn't have to be,' he said. 'She had too definite a
personality.'
Power of observation, professional detachment and nose for a story have made
Lewis into an occasional reporter. He is proud of a 1968 newspaper article,
'Genocide in Brazil,' on the fate of the Indians of the Amazon; it brought
an outcry and a change in Brazilian law.
In The Missionaries, he exposed the cultural depredations of Christian
fundamentalists on South American tribespeople; in a recent book on
Indonesia, he reported on the suppression of the inhabitants of East Timor
and described a vast but little-known mining project on Irian Jaya.
'The purpose, really, is to enjoy myself as a writer. In so far as I
occasionally preach, it's probably the result of a Calvinistic Welsh
upbringing. All the Welsh either write bad poetry or they tend to preach.
'I'm not organised in advance to think what I'm going to do. I might go over
to look at the charming tribes and, suddenly, it will occur to me that
horrific things are happening to them. In my childhood, this religious stuff
was pumped into me, and it comes to the surface. But I'm surprised by it. I
didn't start off with it.'
The Welsh Calvinism was injected by three weird aunts with whom he was sent
to live in Carmarthen. Life back at home in the north London suburb of
Enfield was scarcely normal either: his father became a spiritualist medium
and the house was turned into a temple for the production of ectoplasm and
banal messages from The Other Side.
I asked him: Why didn't you aspire to become a well-paid clerk in a bank,
have your own house, car . . .
'Numerous reasons. Although I like money, like everyone else, I don't really
aspire to be rich. And I don't aspire to have a large house. I always have
the smallest car that money can buy. This is just part of my temperament.
'I haven't really thought clearly over a long period why this should be. I'm
not an aspiring person, not a flamboyant person. I'm a quiet person.' The
suburbs depress him now; he would rather live in a tree hut.
Lewis admires the earliest travel writers including, naturally, Herodotus.
As for his prose style, he admits to the influence of Hemingway, whom he met
in Cuba. 'He broke new territory as far as I was concerned by, on the whole,
stating things in a simple, direct manner which so many authors before him
were unable to do.'
Do you find writing harder or easier now?
'I don't find any difficulty at all, possibly 5 per cent easier.' He does a
maximum 700 words a day, by hand, always in the morning. 'I could force
myself to write in the afternoon but I know perfectly well the next day I'm
going to scrap it.
'I start off with a clean page. It always has to be a lovely, clean page.
And then, at a certain moment, I come back to it with a pair of scissors and
some glue and start cutting bits out. At the end of the day, that sheet
looks like a gypsy's petticoat.
'My wife is the only person - including me, by the way - that can read my
handwriting and she types it for me.'
Why don't you use a machine?
'I'm just temperamentally opposed to machinery. I prefer to pick up a
pencil.'
Lewis's fascination with the primitive does not seem to him to require any
justification. He likes tribespeople - or Mediterranean villagers, for that
matter - because they are 'exceedingly democratic', artistic, courteous,
brave and charming.
Is it the fallacy of the Noble Savage?
'No,' said Lewis, shortly. 'It's not.'
Aren't you hunting for a completely unreal world?
'I'm hunting one that is disappearing, certainly. What I am doing,
selfishly, is making the best of it. I'm enjoying this position. Apres moi,
le deluge, but I don't make the deluge. I'm enjoying it while it's here.'
We argued for a while over whether travel writers bear some responsibility
for the destruction by commerce - including mass tourism - of the wild
places they describe. Lewis denied it but said, finally:
'I'll have another think about that. I'm going to be asked this question
again, quite obviously: I've gotta get my story straight.' He laughed. 'But
I think I've put up a fairly solid defence so far, anyway.'
He added: 'I have periodical urges to emigrate. Nothing ever comes of it.'
He and his wife, Lesley, settled for a while in the wing of a Hohenstaufen
castle near Rome overlooking the ruins of an ancient city. A river ran past
and white cattle with long horns grazed there.
It was an ideal spot for a lover of nature and birds. But, at new year, the
villagers followed the ancient custom of tossing out their old furniture.
They came and threw it in the river. Then men arrived, pushing an old Fiat
van. That, too, was heaved over the parapet of the bridge into the water.
October is the traditional shooting season. The sportsmen arrived, armed
with special whirling machines to attract the game and high-powered guns
with telescopic sights mounted on tripods. Some of them, Lewis swears, were
kitted out in Highland dress - kilts and all. They set about shooting the
songbirds.
'After the massacre,' he ended, 'there were no birds left. So, they went
down to the river and shot the frogs.'
The couple fled back to their own little man-made wilderness in three acres
of Essex garden.
But, I objected, these were charming, primitive customs you should be in
favour of.
Lewis looked furtive, then amused. 'Yes,' he said, 'but you can't expect me
to be totally logical on all fronts.'
Norman Lewis is writing another novel and - by way of self-indulgence - is
planning his next trip, possibly to Colombia. He is nearly 86.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Truth of the Matter: Not all roads lead to Rome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was 50 years ago. A young widow and her four boys came to live in a
village on the edge of some beechwoods.
On the far side of the woods there was an active and expanding Roman
Catholic monastery. Shortly after her arrival two elderly sisters from the
village paid a formal call with the parish magazine. They welcomed her,
admired the furnishings, helped her identify the plants in the garden and
were introduced to her sons.
As they were leaving they turned for a last confidential word. 'We think you
would be well advised not to let the dear boys play in the woods alone. It's
crawling with Romans.'
The prospect of encountering some long lost legion manoeuvres was
intriguing. More intriguing was the lowered voice. I met exactly the same
tone when I once asked my grandmother in the middle of a tea party why Oscar
Wilde was put in prison. 'My dear,' she whispered, 'we do not speak of Oscar
Wilde.'
Times have changed, but 'Rome' and 'going over to Rome' still produce a
frisson in many Church of England parishes, at least in those not devoutly
Anglo-Catholic. It is also a continuing matter of fascination to the secular
press and its readers.
This is not the paranoid hatred and fear of Ulster; nor the bigotry of a Wee
Free Kirk which can excommunicate a Lord Chancellor for attending a requiem
mass. Nevertheless, 400 years after the Reformation there still remains an
underlying mistrust of the Roman Catholic church in the hearts of many
English people, even the unchurched.
So, when a duchess, or an MP, or an Anglican Bishop 'converts' it makes
headline news. The media start taking the pulse of the Church of England and
pronouncing the old dear moribund. The fact that numerically more people are
moving in the opposite direction goes unrecorded. No fanfares for the 300
former Roman Catholic priests admitted to the Episcopal Church in the US.
What is the attraction of Rome? For different people it has a different
pull, but anyone who has not felt that gravitational attraction has not
really understood the spell of catholicism, with all its mystique of
priestcraft, ancient rituals and certainty. Many upper class women whose
marriages are emotionally barren, have found in the sensitive and safe
celibate priest a warm attention to their spiritual needs to which they can
respond with equally safe devotion.
Roman Catholic religious orders hold on behalf of Christendom a depth of
sacramental spirituality which makes many of us feel shallow and
superficial. I count among my dearest friends faithful, intelligent and
loving members of that church.
So why don't we all sign up?
Some will. Those who cannot stomach the ordination of women to the
priesthood may go that way, although probably fewer than the obituary
writers of the C of E would love to believe.
But there will always be a trickle of people who simply find themselves
spiritually more at home on one side of the wall than the other.
In the US the trickle from the Roman church into the Episcopal one is
already a steady stream. But priests brought up in the corner of
Anglo-Catholicism, and some of their devoted laity, will find a warm welcome
in Rome. For that everyone is thankful.
The great majority of Anglicans will resist the gravitational pull of Rome
for equally diverse reasons and prejudices but many for conscience and
intellectual integrity.
God knows the spirituality and discipline of the Church of England are often
shaky, but that may be the price that has to be paid for resisting the claim
of an authority which seeks to dictate the truth of doctrine and morals
regardless of conscience and the evidence.
The Papal ban on contraception is an outrage against conscience and reason,
and is known to be by the majority of Roman Catholic laypeople and priests.
Its consequences for couples are often tragic and for the globe potentially
catastrophic.
The problem with absolute authority is that it can never admit that it was
wrong in the past for fear of undermining its credibility in the present.
The autocratic ideology of the Roman magisterium has had dire consequences
in the realm of science, morals and politics. The claim to irrefutable
certainty may be immensely reassuring to people feeling lost in a welter of
claims for their souls, but it has a devastating effect on scholarship and
open debate.
Against its absolutism the Church of England continues to oppose a reformed
catholicism which holds that the process of establishing truths of faith and
morals is an ongoing task offering - usually - provisional answers. There is
only a continuing dialogue between scripture, tradition, reason and
contemporary knowledge. Absolutes are not on offer.
Between the biblical fundamentalism of the southern Baptist and the papal
fundamentalism of Rome there is not a lot to choose. It is equally
oppressive to be told that the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary into
heaven is a belief necessary for salvation as to be told that the Genesis
story of creation is literally true. Both fundamentalisms are associated
with attitudes to women which are hostile to equal rights. Both intervene
into personal and family life in ways which are intrusive and oppressive.
The fault lines in the Christian world pass right through the churches, not
between them. In European and North American catholicism there is a
significant and growing segment of the church which is distrustful of the
Vatican and the hierarchy, and deplores the retrogressive influence of the
present Pope.
Liberal Anglicans, Lutherans and catholics find they have far more in common
with one another than with the conservative wings of their own denomination.
At the grass roots, lay people are taking matters into their own hands and
voting with their feet on an eclectic ticket.
When on holiday in France many Anglicans are welcomed enthusiastically as
communicants in Roman catholic churches; every Sunday there will be a dozen
Roman catholics communicating in our cathedral. The language of the
liturgies of the churches has now converged to such an extent that
worshippers are often unaware which church they are in.
In spite of all these welcome convergences there remains one insuperable
obstacle for members of the Church of England to any personal or
institutional rapprochement with Rome: the absolutism of papal authority. It
is not just doctrinally or morally uncongenial. However guarded or moderated
in its expression it endangers the freedom of the human spirit. For any
converts looking for a refuge from life's uncertainties it offers a haven of
peace. But until the leopard changes its spots those of a different metal
will not allow it to eat them up.

CHROMA
by Derek Jarman
Century Pounds 15.99, 151 pages
A writer afflicted with Aids, a painter who now can but dimly see, a film
maker who sometimes these days cannot focus his own eyes, Derek Jarman has
chosen in his latest film and now his latest book to contemplate the
phenomenon of colour.
Chroma, printed in sober black on white and deliberately unillustrated, does
not attempt to saturate the reader in the essence of its subject, as his
film Blue did in a grand and glorious gesture. Research for the Blue Concert
in Kyoto, he explains, had thrown him 'deep into the spectrum,' and in
Chroma he shares the fruits of his labour.
This is no list of simple facts, however. Chroma is a typical Jarman
production - personal above all, mixing anecdotes of daily life with
selected gems from the writings of ancient and modern scholars, scientists
and artists, all on the subject of colour. In its pages, colours are
celebrated above all for the complexity of their actions on the senses, the
myriad ways in which they become manifest, entwined with human activity,
inevitably eliciting emotional and irrational responses.
The section headings encapsulate this, the mundanity of familiar concepts -
'White Lies', 'On Seeing Red', 'Grey Matter', 'Green Fingers', 'A Purple
Passage' - exploded in the unpredictable sparkle of the text.
Jarman's has been a life of colour, alive for him as it must be for all
painters, the foremost object of their attention and perennial subject of
their enquiry. The love of colour, however, could not save it, or its
disciple, from a battle against grey. 'Grey was the colour of the Slade,' he
writes, where Jarman's tutor claimed to know nothing of 'modern colour' and
said almost nothing about his pupil's work.
But in his shared student flat, a tide of white washed away the pastels of
the 1950s and opened the door for the rainbow coloured dazzle of hippy
graphics, white being, after all, the representative of light 'without which
no colour can be seen,' as Leonardo wrote.
Jarman is not in search of theoretical purity, preferring books in which the
authors 'put themselves and their prejudices into their writing,' as he
himself does so engagingly. He likes Pliny especially for writing, 'In the
good old days painting was an art,' and mourning the cult of expensive
materials over quality of work.
In the section on red, Jarman links his love of colour to his love of
gardens, another sustaining passion from his childhood. 'Red first shouted
at me from a bed of pelargoniums . . . I was four.' Later he tells us, 'My
red pelargoniums, the colour of flaming June, have never died. Each autumn,
I take cuttings, and though they are confined to a few flower pots, when I
look at them I see the past. Other colours change . . . but the red is
constant . . .'
His mother's red cheeks, red lips, painting his nails with her red nail
polish, his father shouting at him, red in the face, his father who did not
want him to be a sissy. Later, the world of sex was also red, red light
districts, red lights on police cars, caught red handed . . .
And now the red is that of hospitals, this part of the book written on a
hospital drip and dedicated to the doctors and nurses at Barts. 'I know my
colours are not yours,' Jarman writes. 'Context changes the way we perceive
them,' just as the context of the writing of this book inevitably turns it
from an amusing bricollage to a gesture of extraordinary generosity, a
tribute to the continuing need to create and communicate on the very edge of
darkness.

THE FATE OF IBM
by Robert Heller
Little Brown Pounds 16.99, 370 pages
International Business Machines in its heyday believed it was better than
anybody at anything. Challenged to a boat race by Oxford University, its UK
subsidiary trained with characteristic thoroughness and lost convincingly.
Chastened but determined it took on the weaker Cambridge crew and lost
again. Detailed analysis commissioned by IBM Europe uncovered the reason:
while the two universities used one cox and eight oarsmen, IBM had one man
rowing and eight steering. Armonk, IBM's corporate headquarters, studied the
report and issued its solution: 'Change the rower'.
Robert Heller retells this undoubtedly apocryphal story to illustrate the
problems deep within IBM which have conspired to bring the company down. It
is, significantly, the only joke in a book deeply pessimistic about the
future of the world's largest computer manufacturer: 'With the death of the
old IBM in February', he writes, 'the torch has passed not only to its new
leaders, but to others in many other companies'.
He describes his book as a detective story, an investigation of the factors
which led an industrial giant with unprecedented power and influence to lose
money, its reputation as a paragon of managerial virtue and control of its
key markets.
He identifies seven suspects; technological change, the company's
idiosyncratic culture, customer preferences, changing markets, suppliers
turned competitors, globalisation and management faults. All certainly
played their part in IBM's downfall.
The computer industry displays a curious phenomenon; superficially the
technology and the business seem simple; below the surface, however, are
vast complexities.
Here, then, is the simple view of IBM's decline: a large corporation, used
to gross profit margins of 70 per cent or more, failed to change quickly
enough when the larger part of its business moved to commodity products
delivering at most a 20 per cent profit margin.
Reasons for this failure take Heller on a search for clues lasting over 300
pages and bringing the reader en route into contact with many of the
remarkable new individual and companies which populate the new computer
industry: Bill Gates of Microsoft, America's richest man; Ben Rosen, the
brains behind Compaq; Intel, chip maker to the world's personal computer
manufacturers; Ross Perot, the fastest, richest Texan in history.
Reading The Fate of IBM, however, has something in common with a first visit
to a Shakespearian play: it helps to know the story first and to have a
passing acquaintanceship with the language. Chronology is abandoned for the
sake of the plot. Heller moves freely from the early days of IBM to the
present and back again as he develops his theme in a way which sometimes
causes vertigo in the reader. There is a good reason. The personal computer
business is essentially a new industry which has little in common with the
old world of IBM, Unisys and so on. The sharp disjunction around the 1978-82
timeframe makes chronology difficult in such a comprehensive study.
Heller has relied heavily on published sources, mostly US in origin, in
preparing his analysis and this detracts somewhat from the freshness of the
writing. Covering IBM from the UK is difficult; there has only been one
other book of this size about the company - Rex Malik's and tomorrow . . .
the World? (Millington, 1975) - written from the UK to my knowledge.
There is the occasional technical error - An Wang made his money from
patents on core, not bubble, memory - but the judgments on IBM's managerial
failings display Heller's experienced touch.
He will forgive me if I suggest he has not written a 'whodunnit' but a 'why
was it done'. It was always going to be the butler.

William Klein became a fashion photographer by accident. A poor American
artist in Paris of the 1950s he was spotted by the art director of US Vogue
who offered him patronage as a photographer in return for 'odd jobs' on the
magazine. Klein summed up his approach to this new field when confronted by
his first fashion model: 'How do I not make both of us look like fools?'
The answer lay in his ability to stage a scene and see the woman, the
clothes and her environment as a whole.
In Rome (1960-1962) a black veiled hat on a beautiful woman is no longer an
accessory when modelled against the tomb of Keats in the Protestant Cemetery
in Via Caio Cestio.
In and Out of Fashion (Jonathan Cape Pounds 50, 254 pages) meanders through
the fashion capitals of Paris, New York and Rome to his latest work shot
behind the catwalk shows in an array of images that transcend the fashions
they portray.

THE ARABIAN NIGHTS: A COMPANION
by Robert Irwin
Allen Lane Penguin Press Pounds 20, 344 pages
As I read Robert Irwin's book I became more and more painfully aware of my
ignorance of the whole fascinating corpus of stories that goes under the
title of The Arabian Nights. (Literal translation, 'One Thousand Nights and
a Night'). To rely upon one's few childhood memories of the stories of
Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor (heavily bowdlerised, it emerges) is
like thinking you know the Bible because you know about Moses in the
bullrushes, David's conquest of Goliath and other biblical tales re-told for
children.
We tend to regard the Nights as a collection of Arab fairy tales. Irwin, a
novelist and former university teacher, points out that the material
'includes long heroic epics, wisdom literature, fables, cosmological
fantasy, pornography, scatological jokes, mystical devotional tales,
chronicles of low life, rhetorical debates, and masses of poetry. A few
tales are hundreds of pages long; others amount to no more than a short
paragraph.'
The Nights represent texts crucial to Western as well as Middle Eastern
culture; but like the Bible and the works of Homer their authenticity,
chronology, transmission and translation are all matters on which experts
disagree. We do not know who the original authors were; we do not have
complete primary texts from which to work and we English speakers do not
even have a reliable translation of the whole collection, an authorised
version.
The earliest manuscript dates from the ninth century and is in the
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The Victorian period saw a number of
translations into both French and English. The most enlightening part of
Irwin's book is the chapter where he deals with these.
The version by Edward Lane, a lithographer, who worked in Cairo, appeared
from 1838 to 1841, and gave the tales a wide currency in England. Lane was
highly praised by Leigh Hunt; soon Tennyson, Browning and other Victorian
writers were reading the tales. After that few imaginative writers escaped
their influence in some form. Somerset Maugham read the Nights avidly when
he was a schoolboy in his uncle's rectory in Kent where they were the only
fiction on offer; and RL Stevenson wrote a linked series of fresh tales he
called The New Arabian Nights.
Lane's Nights were superseded in 1876-77 by the much fuller version made by
John Payne for the Villon Society containing the scurrilous material that
Lane, a clergyman's son, had left out. Then Sir Richard Burton, the
explorer, who had been consul in Damascus and had published an account of
his Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, approached Payne apparently to
collaborate with him but went on to produce his own version. Irwin shows the
lengths that Burton went to try to disguise how greatly his version was
indebted to Payne's.
There had been versions in French of Les Milles et une nuits since the 18th
century. In 1704 Antoine Galland, an Arabic interpreter and museum curator,
made a version. The odd thing about this was that it appeared to contain
tales that are not in the extant manuscripts and no one is quite sure where
Galland got them from.
At the turn of the century Andre Gide, enamoured of all things Arabic,
poured scorn on Galland's version in order to promote a new version by a
friend of his - a Dr Madrus who hailed from the Caucusus but who was born in
Cairo and had a career in France in medicine. Acclaimed when it appeared,
the Madrus version reads now like a typical art nouveau product containing
'a fantasy Orient, compounded of Opium reveries, jewelled dissipation, lost
paradises, melancholy opulence and odalisques pining in gilded cages'.
Madrus claimed to be translating from a 17th century North African
manuscript. In fact no such manuscript existed but the lie enabled Madrus to
put in embellishments and new stories of his own. This version was
translated from French into English by Powys Mathers in 1923. As recently as
1986 it was being marketed in paperback as 'the only complete and accurate
version' in English.
In 1990 an English version appeared by Husain Haddaway which Irwin
thoroughly recommends for accuracy and readability. But this was taken from
a Calcutta manuscript containing only 271 nights. A wider selection is to be
found in the 1973 version for Penguin by NJ Dawood.
Fortunately much of the charm and the compulsiveness survives in whatever
version one happens to have to hand. The framing device of the whole series
whereby the life of the narrator - the Vizier's beautiful daughter
Sheherazade - hangs on her ability to sustain the curiosity of her
tyrannical audience of one - King Shahiyar - is a timeless metaphor of
authorship. It replicates throughout as characters within stories tell
stories about characters who tell stories upon which their lives depend.
If this was a valid notion a long time ago in the Middle East, Vladimir
Propp the Russian folklorist analysed its continuing validity in his
Morfologia Skazi in 1928, and there have been many subsequent attempts to
codify the tales. Meanwhile contemporary creative writers like John Barth in
his Chimera in 1973 and Salman Rushdie in his Haroun and the Sea of Stories
in 1990 showed how the infinitely proliferating story can be resuscitated
today. It will last as long as their are tales to be told and people to
listen to them. Robert Irwin makes us aware of the strength of this
narrative tradition in a fine, elegant, learned book.

EMPIRE
by Terry Coleman
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15.99, 390 pages
THE MOUNTAIN OF IMMODERATE DESIRES
by Leslie Wilson
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 15.99, 373 pages
There is a peculiar fascination in the Popular Novel when it is well done -
see Du Maurier, Shute, Fowles, and a hundred others. A sub-category, I
suggest, is what I call the Accessible Novel, by which I mean a work of
fiction which is not necessarily exceptionally good, which need not be a
Best Seller, which does not expect a long life, which has limited ambitions,
but which nevertheless gives pleasure to thousands of us.
Of course, some of the finest novels are also utterly Accessible - see
Waugh, Greene, Bellow, etc. The point is that the Accessible Novel is
unashamedly not difficult, not obscure, not highbrow, and is above all a
Good Read. We have two examples this month.
Terry Coleman is an excellent journalist who has taken to writing a superior
sort of historical novel. (The Accessible Novel has a fondness for an
historical setting, perhaps because contemporary society does not lend
itself to adventure, challenge, initiation, the exploration of uncharted
territory - see Paul Scott, Patrick White. JG Farrell, among many others).
Empire tells the story of the annexation of Texas by the US, which almost
didn't happen in 1844.
That may not sound like a rollicking yarn, but Coleman is a gifted writer
and he makes a compelling tale of the largely diplomatic manoeuvres. It is
always evident that the story is firmly grounded in history at a time when
the US was extending its frontiers with a speed which many thought
ill-judged, in the generation before the European powers developed an
interest in acquiring colonies - Britain turned down Mexico's offer of
California and, if this account is correct, Texas was there for London's
taking.
The central character is Sam Houston, president of the sovereign Republic of
Texas, and most of the rest of the cast have their place in history - Andrew
Jackson, for example, and Captain Charles Elliot, who is better known for
his earlier activities in Hong Kong than for his role as British charge
d'affaires to Texas.
Coleman takes a risk with Houston because the man was larger than life, a
great, even mythical popular hero, but he manages to pull it off, which is
to say that Sam Houston rises convincingly from the page. The novelist
invents a certain Lucy Moncrieffe, niece of the British foreign secretary of
the time, Lord Aberdeen, but no harm is done and she makes a surprisingly
uninhibited Victorian heroine. The test of an historical novel must always
be whether or not it helps our imaginative understanding of an obscure and
distant time. Yes, it does.
Leslie Wilson also turns to the 19th century for her tale of an English
youth and a Chinese girl in Hong Kong. The Mountain of Immoderate Desires is
a bit more complicated than that: the man is convinced that he is the
illegitimate son of Queen Victoria (by John Brown) and the girl is a Suchow
foundling adopted by an elderly English scholar to help him achieve
immortality with the help of Taoist sexual exercises.
That sounds a pretty rich brew, but Wilson has a vigorous imagination and
her novel, with its detailed canvas of Hong Kong a hundred years ago, is
unfailingly fascinating. Unlike Coleman, Wilson uses fictional characters
and they make a vivid gallery of the late-Victorian empire.
It is a lively book, and a successfully one, even if the prose is sometimes
clumsy. To resort to the simplest critical comment - I liked it.

THE FERMATA
By Nicholson Baker
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 305 pages
WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA
by Scott Bradfield
Picador Pounds 14.99, 196 pages
Nicholson Baker made his reputation by possessing a keen eye for the small
things in life, the benign gadgets and quiet moments other writers
neglected. In his early novels, he depicted minutiae like plastic straws and
diaper stays in a way that made them positively luminous. But in Vox, his
third novel, Baker's gaze blurred somewhat as he focussed on the more often
perused subject of sex. Now, with The Fermata, he seems to have gone
positively myopic as he searches for a new way to look at, well,
masturbation.
The book's conceit is the stuff of a schoolboy's wet dreams. The narrator,
Arno Strine, finds himself able to stop time, to create a cosmic pause in
which all life (except his own) is placed in suspended animation. He uses
this power not to rob banks or steal state secrets, but to undress and
fondle women. Although the nerdy Arno never actually rapes the frozen
females he encounters, he gladly uses them as three-dimensional pin-ups for
some acrobatic self-abuse.
At first, it is hard to know just how to take Baker's novel. There is no
sense of Arno using time's suspension to achieve some sort of self-knowledge
or personal growth. Supernatural conventions are easily acceptable in
serious fiction when they provide some sort of satirical or thematic slant
on a subject, though Baker seems too interested in his sweaty palmistry for
that sort of sophistication. Before long, The Fermata simply becomes a
numbing succession of pornographic set-pieces.
But there would have been nothing wrong with even that - if the book were
funny. But Baker's wit, so sharp in his earlier efforts, seriously misfires
when focussed on the female anatomy. Having embraced the potentially fertile
trickster myth, he delivers only the most obvious sort of gags, thereby
passing up untold opportunities for real laughs. In the end, The Fermata
reads like nothing more than the confessions of some pimply high school
sophomore in the throes of unrelieved pubescent tumult.
There is an equally bizarre pretext behind Scott Bradfield's second novel,
What's Wrong with America. In it, Emma O'Hallahan, a 69-year-old Southern
Californian grandmother, decides she has had enough of her husband, Marvin.
So, being the red-blooded American woman she is, she lets him have it in the
back of the head with a shotgun, buries him in the backyard and proceeds to
get on with her life. Soon, however, a nosy next door neighbour begins to
wonder what became of Marvin. She, too, finds herself pushing up daisies.
Free at last, Emma starts drinking and dating a shy widower, only to find
out that his wife's recent death was not from natural causes, either. The
California suburbs, it seems, are not such a cosy place after all.
Told in the form of Emma's thunderingly banal diaries, Bradfield's novel is
an often hilarious black comedy about the twin demons of the American psyche
 -casual violence and facile self-improvement. The author proves himself a
master of the unreliable narrator technique, keeping the reader guessing
from the first cheerily bloody pages whether or not to believe Emma. Is
Marvin's decaying ghost really visiting her? Is he dead at all? And just who
is buried in that third grave in the back garden?
It is only at the end, when Emma's narration gives way to the babble of her
airhead grandson, that the novel loses its edge. That said, What's Wrong
with America remains a daring and largely successful satire on that vast
insane asylum known as California.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: That old family magic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is nice to see an old fashioned show for all the family back in the
wicked West End. The star of The Magic Man is, of course, Paul Daniels, but
there are good parts for son Martin, a softer, cuddlier, version of Dad, and
for Mrs Daniels, who spends most of her time de-materialising.
Elder son Paul gets a brief drive-on role, but, like Mrs D. soon disappears,
complete with Harley Davidson, into the absolute. Martin's fiancee is just
starting in the family business, as dancer and prop carrier, but can draw
inspiration from her future mother-in-law, who when she was young Debbie
McGee, hoofed for ages before being allowed to tackle dialogue.
Apart from losing some hair, and gaining an extra staff member, this is
basically the show that Paul Daniels played to great acclaim at the same
theatre in 1980. Over time Daniels has allowed his prickly personality
fuller rein. He is like a grumpy pixie, superb at chatting up the audience,
but an obvious martinet behind the scenes. I felt sorry for the drummer who
missed a roll; and for Martin when he fluffed a gag. They were probably
turned into rabbits later.
Daniels is a tough law and order man - he thinks judges should be strung up
for softness - and the steel behind the banter makes for an intriguing show.
He is an excellent improviser, and rides his luck, which, on Thursday, kept
coming up aces.
One magical secret is to get members of the audience to take responsibility
for tired material. So the boring solid, or not so solid, ring trick was
entertaining because a sweet nine-year-old birthday girl acted as stooge.
Daniel also hit gold with a police inspector from Essex and a medical
student from Malaysia who were happily humiliated as first they handed over
their cash to Daniel, and were then ejected from, and stuck to, their
chairs.
There seems little new in the world of magic. Mrs D still disappears from
the box in which she has been transfixed by spears, and atomises as she is
wafted to the flies in the final illusion. A postman from Camden Town, who
foolishly shed a shoe to be more comfortable, was painlessly guillotined. A
troupe of six dancers proved that revue is dead.
Martin Daniels is the nice one, who sings and tells jokes and would make a
wonderful children's entertainer. Paul has the world weary air of the old
pro. But the joins do not show and the audience was well pleased. I did spot
a flaw. The policeman was asked to think of an international celebrity and
Paul promised to read his mind and conjure up a photo. Presumably back stage
they were well prepared for Mrs Thatcher, John Major, Madonna, etc. The
Essex man came up with Ted Heath. It was well in period with the show, but
no photograph was forthcoming. There is a difference between magic and
miracles.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Babes in the Warehouse - Strange happenings in deepest
Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shiny Nylon is Urban Panic, says the publicity material for a bizarre event
that opens next week in S-Shed, London's newest and most uncomfortable
venue. For 12 days a filthy, unheated former tobacco warehouse in deepest
Docklands will host a curious mixture of installation art, dance and rock
opera.
The show has been commissioned by Jules Wright of the Womens Playhouse Trust
who last October brought us Dirt - a dance around washing up bowls performed
by ordinary people in the disused Wapping Pumping Station.
Shiny Nylon was inspired by Wright's - questionable - observation that
cities are changing. One of the elements of these altered cities, she
argues, is panic. She defines the state as 'confusion that arises when you
can no longer make sense of your circumstances'. In that case, Shiny Nylon
hits it right on the head.
Those who do have an inkling of what the project is about seem to disagree
with each other. The confusion is the result of Wright having commissioned
three single-minded creative artists, each with their own ideas. Wright says
it is about journeys, 'literal journeys, desire to travel, travelling in
your mind.' Deborah Levy, writer and director of Shiny Nylon sees it in
terms of Babe, the central character. 'When Babe got run over on the
motorway, she said she had seen her death on the big screen 50 times over .
. . Read her beautiful lips: Babe wants to be a love diva but no one taught
her how to kiss.' Babe, it seems is a bundle of impressions; during the show
nothing happens to her at all.
When Deborah Levy first saw the echoing emptiness of the S-Shed she was
horrified. But Anya Gallaccio, the artist who recently smeared 300 bars of
melted chocolate on the walls of a London gallery, was ecstatic. To her, the
soulless space was crying out for two voluminous red and gold velvet
curtains, to sweep up and down the full length of the warehouse, and for a
bank of 100 19th century theatre seats (there will be standing room for 50).
There will also be mirrors of every shape and size. The one thing that will
be lacking is Nylon, shiny or otherwise. Gallaccio evidently does not feel
bound to take Levy's title literally. The choreographer, Kristina Page,
whose dancing has been described as 'visceral', sees the sloping concrete
walls and pillars as ideal material to throw herself against and wrap
herself around.
If Shiny Nylon works, it does not matter whether it is about anything at
all. Watching a rehearsal in which the singer, 'Babe' Jenny Potter, and
dancers haul the curtains up and down, and stretch their bodies against the
mossy walls to a sound track suggesting Velvet Underground, you begin to
feel that this could, in the end, be something special.
Even so, you might wonder what the London Docklands Development Corporation
is doing putting about Pounds 25,000 into this sort of thing (Pounds 5,000
into the show and Pounds 20,000 into refurbishing the warehouse). If it
wants to encourage businesses to move to Docklands, getting them to its
bleakest spot for an evening standing up watching something without plot is
a strange way to go about it. And those who thread their way through the
neighbouring building site afterwards to Custom House station may experience
some Urban Panic first hand.
Yet to argue that would be to miss the point. The LDDC has set itself the
ambitious target of building up an arts centre as good as any in London,
with its newly-appointed arts manager Katherine Orrell drawing on regional,
national and international talent.
The S-Shed is only one of many old, and sometimes beautiful, warehouses that
are empty on the Royal Victoria Dock. Orrell is attempting to find better
use for them. 'I have an unashamed wish to bring in people with oomph and
power to make things happen', she says.
Wright agrees that Shiny Nylon is risky, but says that it is good to 'create
the freedom to fail'. She has had some failures herself recently - her
controversial attempt last year to take over the Riverside Studios in
Hammersmith was shortlived - but she seems unmoved by predictions of
disaster for this latest project. 'Everyone says: 'no one will come to that,
Jules' - but they will. They always do'.
Shiny Nylon runs from February 15 to 27. Tickets 071 379 9700

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Sweat and hope at the Kirov - Max Loppert visits the
Rimsky-Korsakov festival in St Petersburg and marvels at the energy and
enthusiasm shown amid the saddening decay in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miracle - it is an ill-advised term of praise for any performing arts
company, however fine: human sweat, not divine intervention, is invariably
the source of artistic excellence. Nevertheless, there does seem something
miraculous about the ability of the Kirov Opera of St Petersburg to
flourish, and extend itself in bold new projects, at exactly the time when
all around it - in the nobly handsome, often deeply saddening Baltic city
itself, in Russia as a whole - decay is plentifully in evidence.
Down the road from the Maryinsky Theatre stands the blue-painted, gilt-domed
church of St Nicholas, a splendid sight in the distance - and a distressing
one in closeup, with its cracked stucco and peeling walls. During a
seven-day St Petersburg sojourn for the Kirov's Rimsky-Korsakov in the 20th
Century Festival, images of physical decay were transmitted from almost all
of the city's main monuments and cultural institutions.
In sharp contrast, the Maryinsky building presents a reasonably sound
aspect; and what goes on inside the wonderfully beautiful 144-year-old house
demonstrates no hint of collapse, nor even of heads-just-above-water. The
theatre's long and glorious operatic tradition acts not as the straitjacket
of Soviet eras past but the source of fresh inspiration. The company is
abundantly stocked with notable voices and personalities, a youthfully
exuberant orchestra, and a repertory of productions by no means
backward-looking.
The engine-room of the Kirov's miraculous vitality and profusion of operatic
activity (reflected by first-rate Kirov records and videos now pouring out
on the Philips label) is the extraordinary Valery Gergiev, who became the
company's artistic director and principal conductor in September 1988, at
the age of only 35.
Gergiev is now a known quantity in all the world's main musical centres. But
to see him in action during the festival - conducting every one of its four
Rimsky operas and five Rimsky-pivoted concerts, keeping up a punishing
schedule of rehearsal, administration, recording and meeting-the-press the
while - was to appreciate just how crucial he is to the Kirov's existence,
and it to his: how completely his 'human sweat', and vision, motivate its
ethos.
Not every event was equally polished - certain concert works emerged plainly
under-prepared - yet the fire of Gergiev's artistic imagination warmed all
of them equally, leaving the lucky festival-visitor at the end with the
enlarged horizons always looked for, seldom attained in such enterprises.
I shall focus on the subject of conductor and company in a second article;
for the moment my brief is to describe, albeit summarily, the excitements of
the Kirov Rimsky-Korsakov experience - in a theatre where most of his operas
were first given, across the square from the conservatory where he taught,
and in the 150th anniversary year of his birth.
This was the third of Gergiev's single-figure festivals - following his
Mussorgsky (1989) and Prokofiev (1992) - and, for a Westerner, probably the
most ear-and eye-opening of the three. Rimsky-Korsakov exists on the margins
of our opera-house repertories; whenever he is briefly moved to a more
central position (such as by the ENO's recent Christmas Eve), problems of
performance style tend to weigh heavily on the resultant impression.
In such circumstances, received opinion about the ephemeral charms of his
glittery, fantastic sound-world and the psychological and emotional flatness
of his characterising powers proves hard to put to any really vigorous test.
Gergiev's choice of festival operas covered the span of Rimsky's creation,
from the first, The Maid of Pskov (premiered 1873, later much revised), to
the penultimate, The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh (1907), with the
'fable-opera' Sadko (1898) and the fairy-tale one-acter Kashchey the
Immortal (1902) in between.
All four were tuned to a high pitch of communicativeness by Gergiev's
particular conductor's gift, which is the maintenance of an intensely vital
lyrical sonority across broad, unhurried dramatic sequences. The 'basics' of
natively idiomatic timbre and accent, of that ability to be folkily amusing
without straying into kitsch or whimsy, are the common virtues of Russian
Rimsky interpretation. These opera performances, given uncut on Gergiev's
insistence, went far beyond those basics.
The big revelation, for me, came with Sadko: a series of picturesque
tableaux, earthly and supernatural, submarine and terrestrial, which were
threaded into one long enchantment. The missionary purpose of the staging
was to revive the early-1920s Sadko designs of the artist Konstantin
Korovin, whose brilliant colours and picturebook patterns were melded into
the musical detail. The work's French Grand Opera inheritance - a big
'public' scene in the middle, a vital infusion of dance elements
(exquisitely done by the Kirov Ballet) - seemed not at all mere Meyerbeerian
machinery, but a prime reason for the work's captivating many-sidedness.
High hopes had been pinned on Kitezh, the festival's single brand-new
production. Known in the trade as 'the Russian Parsifal', this is an
altogether harder task than either Sadko or the youthfully surefire Maid of
Pskov, with its elements of historical drama (Ivan the Terrible's
confrontation with the city of Pskov) thrillingly resonant with sharp-cut
contrasts and Boris-like bell-tollings.
The late work's elevated fusion of antique and Christian legend (the reason
for the scarcity of Kitezh performances in Soviet times) lacks 'animal'
dramatic energy. Luminous, rarefied beauties of sound and spirit may abound
on every page but tedium is not always kept at bay - at least not by a
production crudely lit, and excessively reliant on fuzzy projection, gauze
front-cloths and sugar-iced costumes.
Apart from Gergiev and his orchestra, the sustaining compensation was the
solo singing, which highlighted the Kirov's envy-inducing individual
strengths as much as its ensemble ones. Here is a shortlist of memorable
names, notables of more than one evening's cast, who would grace any
international stage (and in several cases have already done so): the strong
lyric tenor Yury Marusin, vocally much more exactly-tuned than when he was
Glyndebourne's unforgettable Spades Hermann; the ringing spinto tenor
Vladimir Galuzin; the smooth, lustrous mezzo Larissa Dyadkova; the basses
Vladimir Ognovenko and Gennady Bezzubenkov; the baritone Alexander Gergalov,
newest in a distinguished Kirov line; the warm-toned soprano Valentina
Tsedipova.
Galina Gorchakova, possibly the world's richest young soprano talent, played
Fevroniya in Kitezh and the Pskov title role. The tender-hearted simplicity
of her demeanour and the velour, radiance and house-filling amplitude of her
vocal line properly warrant paragraphs of enthusiasm. As current Kirov prima
donna she seems to sum up everything that is finest and most inspiring about
the whole company.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Werewolf' steps in and out of the fright genre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ken Hill has written and produced another shocker from the Theatre Royal
Stratford East. Panting at the heels of The Invisible Man is The Curse of
the Werewolf (pictured above). It could be a whisker more frightening and a
bound or two faster, but it makes wonderful entertainment.
The plot matters little for this horror-comedy-musical; setting is all. Take
one Bavarian castle and people it with a mad scientist, a smooth German
baron, four silly English aristocrats and a sinister Chief of Police, and
the show appears to run itself. The fine set (Sarah-Jane McClelland)
benefits from excellent lighting (Gerry Jenkinson), producing the requisite
mix of moonlight and shadow.
Hill's Invisible Man kept farce at bay by stepping in and out of the fright
genre; the same will happen with Werewolf once the production settles, but
it does risk camping up the action and losing the ripping story in a series
of stagy set pieces. The show has a strong cast, some catchy tunes, and
suits the friendly atmosphere of the theatre.
Best of all, of course, are the moonlight transformations of Baron 'I must
go and change' von Heilman. From the twitching of the hair on the back of
his hands to the screaming of the heroine as he carries her off it is
unremitting excitement.
Elsewhere there is a ruined church, a super ski-run, the inevitable
laboratory, a wolf grotto (certainly cave lupem) and plenty of deep Bavarian
gloom put over in cod German and punctuated by the ululating wolves.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: In the footsteps of Berenson - Susan Moore pays
tribute to the late, great connoisseur Philip Pouncey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Pouncey's feats of connoisseurship have become legendary. Possessing
an encyclopaedic knowledge of both Italian Renaissance painting and drawing,
and blessed with an unfailing visual memory, he was able to make discoveries
in field that eluded fellow experts. Over almost 60 years of study, he
correctly identified some 1,000 anonymous or mis-catalogued drawings in
collections around the world.
The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Louvre and the Uffizi have all
staged handsome exhibitions in homage to Pouncey, who died in 1990. Now it
is the turn of the British Museum, where Pouncey was Assistant Keeper of
Prints and Drawings from 1945-66. While the previous shows celebrated his
brilliant attributions with choice selections of Italian drawings, the BM
also attempts to demonstrate the working methods of a connoisseur. In so
doing it defends the validity of this now unfashionable approach to art
history.
Like his great precursors Bernard Berenson, Crowe and Cavalcaselle, Pouncey
understood the fundamental importance of reconstructing an artist's oeuvre,
of defining an individual style and being able to distinguish it from
another. As almost no Renaissance drawings are signed or documented,
identifying the draughtsman's hand is rarely easy. An eye for quality is
also essential to distinguish copy from original.
Pouncey's rare capacity to empathise with particular artistic personalities
is most vividly witnessed by a crouching male nude by Bastianino, an obscure
Ferrarese imitator of Michelangelo by whom no drawings were known to
survive. 'If Bastianino had made drawings,' declared Pouncey, 'this is
exactly the sort of drawing one would have expected from him.' Sure enough,
he later discovered the figure - a devil about to seize his victim - in
Bastianino's altarpiece of the Last Judgment in Rovello Porro.
He attributed another sheet to the 16th century Veronese artist Domenico
Brusasorci, and added that it looked like a study for a painting on slate.
The related picture was located in Hungary. Its support was, of course,
slate.
Such inspired insights, although sometimes the work of a moment, were the
result of the devotion of a lifetime. Notebooks dating from Pouncey's first
trip to Italy in 1932-3 show him copying figures and drawing plans of fresco
cycles as a means of fixing them in his memory. Then came annotating
reference books and meticulously cross-referenced notebooks, index-cards,
correspondence and files. The passion for exhaustive list-making even
extended to the cellar-book where the carefully chosen and lovingly
cherished claret was as scrupulously indexed as any minor masterpiece.
This unusual show is an affectionate tribute to a remarkable scholar.
Few artists have had the opportunity - or the ability - to determine
posterity's vision of their age. In his celebrated studies of the court of
Henry VIII, Hans Holbein the Younger gave us a totally convincing cast of
characters and sense of the sober mood of Reformation England. It was the
Swiss artist's good fortune to come to a court of a king who had broken with
Rome and had no need of altarpieces and Madonnas. For Holbein's gift was for
portraiture.
His meticulously wrought and sensitive likenesses in black and coloured
chalks preserved in the royal collection - of the family of the saintly Sir
Thomas More, the poets Surrey and Wyatt, and the likes of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, William Warham and the odious Southwell - make their final stop
on a national tour at the NPG in London.
*
Finally, a rare instance of a work of art of national interest repatriated
to a British public collection. The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford has acquired
from a French private collector Rubens' fine portrait of the Earl of
Arundel, one of the earliest and greatest of all English antiquaries and
collectors. Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox negotiated the purchase and the Pounds
900,000 was provided by grants from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the
National Art-Collections Fund, the MGC/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund, the Michael
Marks Charitable Trust and the Friends of the Ashmolean.
Rubens probably made the chalk and pen drawing from the life while on a
diplomatic mission to Charles I in 1629-30 and took it back to Antwerp to
serve as a likeness for a number of painted portraits of the Earl. As the
Ashmolean holds most of Arundel's collection of classical sculpture, the
Musee du Louvre raised no objection to the export of the drawing.
The Study of Italian Drawings: The Contribution of Philip Pouncey; British
Museum until April 24. Holbein and the Court of Henry VIII, sponsored by
Capital House: National Portrait Gallery until April 17. Director's Choice:
Dutch and Flemish drawings; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, until March 27

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Scots hung up over gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A delphic statement by the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland
over its controversal plans to create a new gallery of Scottish art has
received a wary response.
There has been outcry in Edinburgh over plans to establish the new gallery
in Glasgow, using pictures from two Edinburgh collections; the National
Portrait Gallery, which would close, and the National Gallery.
A recent House of Lords debate ended with a ministerial statement that the
final decision was the government's. This week the trustees said they
remained committed to the idea of the new gallery, but were 'conducting a
further detailed appraisal to consider how, consistent with that objective,'
the portrait gallery could remain in its present building.
That could signal a reprieve for the portrait gallery. But since it's
collection was supposed to have been the nucleus of the new gallery,
sceptics ask if the trustees now intend taking more Scottish masterpieces
from the National Gallery to bolster pictures currently in storage. Others
think the whole project is a dead duck.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: An upmarket Big Issue - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I must not whinge: it is a message that seems to have hit home. The bosses
of our leading arts companies now present an optimistic, expansionary, face
to the world - and to hell with their deficits. The English National Opera
and the Royal Shakespeare Company share one thing in common - they each have
an accumulated debt of around Pounds 2.4m.
But are they down hearted - no] On Thursday Dennis Marks of the ENO unveiled
a plan to cut his losses by putting on more new productions next season and
yesterday Adrian Noble of the RSC was equally buoyant. 'This is a time for
modest boasting, both financially and artistically.'
Noble revealed audiences at 83 per cent of capacity for both his London and
Stratford operations, the highest for almost ten years, plus a profit this
financial year which will enable him to shave the deficit slightly. Some of
this bullishness was induced by the Pounds 3.3m, over three years, from new
sponsor Allied Lyons - businessmen hate defeatist talk. But with near sell
outs for RSC productions of Tamberlaine, Macbeth and Travesties in London
Noble can afford some self congratulation.
Next season he is playing safe, with Stratford presenting four new
productions of Shakespearean favourites, Henry V with Iain Glen as Harry,
Twelfth Night starring Emma Fielding and Haydn Gwynne, A Midsummer Night's
Dream with Toby Stephens, and Steven Pimlott's Measure for Measure. The
Barbican is even safer, with last season's Stratford successes moving to the
capital, although more exciting plays are promised for the autumn.
The two smaller auditoria at Stratford get some stimulation with the
unknown, late 17th century play The Wives' Excuse and the very rare John
Ford 1629 tragedy The Broken Heart at the Swan, plus new plays by Anne
Devlin and David Edgar at the Other Place. But all in all the RSC is
conforming to the received wisdom that in a time of frozen Arts Council
grants and choosy audiences this is no time for risk taking.
Dennis Marks cannot be quite so sanguine because on top of his accumulated
deficit he has a projected annual shortfall this season of around Pounds
500,000. He is going ahead with repairing a repertoire which was only
fitfully replenished during the last years of the Peter Jonas reign, when
the recession knocked 20 per cent off the ENO's annual audience.
Marks has quickly discovered that economising on new productions and relying
on revivals is box office suicide. Even the best productions, like the
seasonal Hansel &amp; Gretel, have a limit to their shelf-life. So he has lifted
the number of new productions in 1994-95 from six to eight, creating fresh
versions of old war horses like Tosca and Don Giovanni, extending into the
romantic repertoire with the first ENO productions of Massenet's Don
Quichotte and Mussorgsky's Khovanschina, bringing back after a lengthy
interval a new version of Mahagonny, and throwing in the home grown King
Priam and A Midsummer Night's Dream. The sliver of the contemporary is the
UK premiere of Schnittke's Life with an Idiot.
Thanks to new productions of popular favourites like Der Rosenkavalier and
La boheme audiences are 3 per cent up so far this season, and every
additional 1 per cent adds Pounds 100,000 to the revenue. With luck, planned
changes in back stage workings, involving some redundancies, and the New
Stages Appeal to the ENO's loyal audience, targetted to raise Pounds 250,000
this season, should, between them, enable the company to break even, while
higher box office income in future years is expected to pay off the
overdraft by the end of the millennium.
The ENO is also starting its season later, in September, and renting out the
Coliseum to commercial managements during the Christmas period as well as
the summer. This could reduce its own performances to under 200 a year, but
there will be fewer of those uncomfortable evenings when the audience is
less than 60 per cent of capacity, and within a few years the ENO should be
able to offer shorter runs of a considerably greater number of operas,
including the traditional favourites in fresh dressings.
If you throw in the Royal Opera House and the National Theatre, the
accumulated deficits of the four flagship companies must exceed Pounds 8m,
but there is no sense of panic. The National Theatre has cut back on new
productions but is doing well on established favourites and Covent Garden is
switching productions at the last minute to optimise its box office.
Perhaps they have all heard the rumours that one of Lord Gowrie's conditions
for taking over as chairman of the Arts Council was the promise of a higher
Arts Council grant for 1995-96. Certainly Lord Palumbo, who did well
financially for the arts during his five years as chairman, can rightly feel
disgruntled about not getting the rise in funding he had been promised for
his final year.
*
On the surface there is a yawning gap between the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, and The Big Issue, the newspaper distributed to help the homeless.
Yet the Opera House is advertising for customers in the campaigning
magazine. The seats it wants to sell are for Saturday nights, when, six
times this season, the average price is Pounds 11 and best stalls seats cost
Pounds 18 rather than Pounds 102.
It is part of a scheme to help Covent Garden lose its elitist image and be
seen to be accessible to a wider public, in particular to pensioners, the
unemployed, and students. Saturday night is not the most popular with the
traditional opera and dance audiences - corporate seats are unfilled and
other regulars are away in the country. Covent Garden hoped to get sponsors
to underwrite the performances which cost it Pounds 40,000 in lost revenue
for a dance evening and Pounds 60,000 for opera, but to date no backers have
been forthcoming.
It has pressed ahead independently and is happy with the results. The annual
season supported by the Paul Hamlyn Trust, which is aimed at the
disadvantaged, has given it a large mailing list to sell to, but anyone able
to prove that they are not in receipt of a regular wage can qualify for the
cheap Saturday night tickets. The next bargain evening is the first
performance of the ballet Manon on July 2 and Covent Garden hopes to repeat
the concept, perhaps with more such Saturday nights, next season.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Dancing for posterity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cameras were in the Royal Opera House last week to record two performances
of Mayerling which will provide the substance of a commercial video. The
news is doubly good. Mayerling is a repertory favourite - MacMillan's most
adventurous full-length creation - and it is currently receiving admirable
performance from Irek Mukhamedov as Rudolf, Viviana Durante as Mary Vetsera
and Lesley Collier as Countess Larisch. And it is a work which shows the
depth and assurance of the Royal Ballet as an ensemble of dance actors.
This is where the good news is doubled, for the history of the Royal Ballet
repertory on film, of making sure that significant ballets and outstanding
performances have a lasting memorial, is not happy. How did Antoinette
Sibley dance Aurora? Why was Lynn Seymour's Juliet so perfect? What of
Anthony Dowell in Shadowplay and David Wall in Knight Errant, - Antony
Tudor's contributions - or Monica Mason's prodigious incarnation of the
Chosen One in MacMillan's Rite of Spring? Future generations of dance-lovers
will never know, because film has failed them.
And what of La Fille mal gardee with its glorious original cast, excellently
captured in 1962 by Margaret Dale for BBCTV in black and white but never
made available to the public? What, indeed, of the Ashton repertory - the
foundation of our national ballet - which should have been preserved under
Ashton's supervision so that his 'style', the essence of his creativity,
might be understood for the future. An appreciable number of Balanchine's
works have been saved on film: the next century will know how he wished his
ballets to look. A decade after Ashton's death, his choreography languishes
in the repertory, and is already diminished in manner.
The catalogue of missed opportunities is long and lamentable. The music of
this century is securely ours, thanks to the gramophone. Of great and
un-recorded dance, in an age when film has perpetuated scoundrels, political
nonentities, and an eternity of foolish acting, only those who long for a
brief clip of Nijinsky or of Diaghilev's troupe can know. And despair.
We have thrown away our dance-past. Ballet has always been an art of the
moment: it seems more than perverse that, in an age when we can capture the
moment easily, we have missed the chance to keep great art for posterity.
In 1978, when Mayerling was new, it was filmed at Covent Garden by Derek
Bailey, one of the most influential of directors of dance for the screen.
Sections of this performance were seen in his programme MacMillan's
Mayerling, which won the Italia Prize for the South Bank Show. The full
ballet was never released for public viewing, and the staggering
performances of David Wall, Lynn Seymour, Merle Park, still lie in the
vaults. I suppose. I hope. It was, happily and ironically, Bailey who also
directed last week's recording.
In the post-war years, BBC TV transmitted a fascinating variety of dance. In
what must seem a golden age in the 1970s, both BBC and independent companies
initiated programmes which brought important dance to the public. Later
events - the Bolshoi in the Park of 1986, and the 1988 celebration of
Makarova's return to the Kirov Ballet in London, together with recordings,
again by Derek Bailey, of MacMillan's The Prince of the Pagodas and Winter
Dreams - seem exceptions rather than the entertainment rule.
Today, the ballet repertory shrinks as audiences decline. (And switch off -
and are switched off by - dismal nonsenses like the Dancing series that
cluttered BBC schedules last year, or the witless miniatures lately offered
as an Arts Council project.) People are reluctant to go to the ballet:
ticket prices are prohibitive and titles have to be brand-name familiar.
Such attitudes have diminished the dance itself; companies increasingly rely
upon Swan-fakery to fill the house. If an attempt is not made to bring more
theatrical dance to the screen, to win and inspire an audience, we fail the
public, as we fail dance.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Gardening: The maniacs have taken over at the nursery - A
garden centre that thrives on tidiness and teamwork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was under glass in a Midlands field, not far from Wolverhampton, as the
rain drove in from the south-west. But who cares about the weather when
hardy winter plants are flowering by the 100?
Eight years ago, when Weekend FT was started, I went to the Midlands to look
for an emerging market which might survive Margaret Thatcher, prime minister
of the day. I thought I had found it at Ashwood Nurseries, at Kingswinford,
north of Kidderminster, off the A449.
They were making a name for their new Lewisias, small hardy plants which
carry showers of flower in late spring and vary from the easy to the
awkward. The place had quality and the management struck me as something
special so I wrote and said so.
Mrs Thatcher has now become Lady Thatcher but I still have my Ashwood
Lewisias and many readers have turned up at that Midlands nursery with a
crumpled page from an old FT.
My discovery of garden centres was characteristically welcomed by Arthur
Hellyer, the FT's gardening writer for more than 30 years, during the
Chelsea flower show nearly two years ago. How I wish Arthur, who died in
January last year, could have rediscovered this one with me.
Three weeks ago, I was making an anti-clockwise tour of London's first
flower show of the season. I was enjoying the specialists' Hellebores and
admiring the winter greenery when I hit on the best exhibit of them all.
Carpets of pink, white and magenta hardy cyclamen ran beneath winter prunus,
witch hazel and a display of Lenten Roses and hybrid forms of Helleborus
Orientalis.
It seemed to have a height, colour and clearness of leaf which was new.
Mid-winter seemed a mirage; even the Royal Horticultural Society judges gave
the stand a gold medal.
It turned out to be Ashwood Nurseries taking their fifth gold medal in their
fifth RHS show. Following them back to base, I found that the news for
gardeners was excellent. Since 1986, the nursery has grown 20-fold; it
employs 53 people and its new initiatives are the gold-winning cyclamen and
hellebores, built up in the last three years.
The founder, John Massey, is the son of an engineer and recalls that his
best subject at school was Latin. 'I am absolutely hopeless with money,' he
assures me. 'I leave the bills entirely to the others; I haven't a clue
about business rules, except that businesses which follow the rules seem to
go broke.'
He does not bother with a computer, and when he thought he had 300 stock
plants of hardy cyclamen, Philip Baulk, his breeder-collaborator, had to
point out that they already had more than 800. (I should add that Baulk has
found no satisfactory system for automatic watering and every single plant
is watered by hand.)
This archaic enterprise has two irreplaceable assets that has enabled it to
progress. It insists absolutely on top quality and immaculate tidiness, and
devotional team work, seven days a week, from managers who are still in it
for the sake of the plants and the customers, not the share option or the
meaningless meeting.
For years, hardy cyclamen have had their own expert society and hellebores
have had some great breeders: Ashwood's team has now moved into these
revered pastures, backed by their skill in Lewisias and the application of
cash made from their nursery's general quality stock.
Are the heroes of the hellebore rather uneasy, I asked, thinking of the
Whites and their recent medals at Blackthorn in Hampshire; the legendary
Helen Ballard, queen for years of the rounded flower without spots; and
Elizabeth Strangman, author with Graham Rice of the best of the new
hellebore books, just published by David &amp; Charles at Pounds 16.99.
Ashwood's answer is that they have had no hard feelings. The reigning
experts have passed on many of their best plants and are enjoying the
results as new crosses extend the base which they have established.
On visiting Ashwood, I think they have sensed what everyone does: the place
is run by plant maniacs to whom you could not wish ill if you tried.
Go and see it: the cyclamen coum and the Lenten hellebores ought to be good
for this weekend and next. In late April, the Lewisias are flat out. They
are 14-years-old in some cases and the stock has been increased by the
owners' fact-finding visit to the plants' native Pacific homes in America.
This year, 3,000 Hellebores, newly created from three-year-old crosses, have
been sold at Pounds 5.95 each. Next year, the target is 10,000.
The cyclamen, meanwhile, are sold through a seed list which is issued in
June to those who write in with a stamp. The nursery grows seed for Suttons
and sells the rest of it fresh for sowing in September.
Its coum strain, supervised by Philip Baulk, is spectacular and completely
hardy. If you sow it in September, you should have a thick range of
seedlings up and showing by Christmas.
The Hellebores are truly exciting. Lesser operations could only sell a few
dozen from amateurs' stocks each year, but Ashwood has the staff and scale
to go for a huge market. In their private houses, I saw whites,
grey-purples, green and cream yellows and exquisite pinks quite apart from
the sombre purples and blacks.
I hate the doubles and John Massey is not too keen on them either. Spotted
forms are charming, although purists have sometimes frowned on them: Ashwood
whites with purple blotches promise to have a vigour and charm which was
beginning to dwindle from some of the older experts' bloodlines.
Outdoors, we can all grow these deep-rooting beauties which like to be left
in peace.
The old leaves should be cut off in spring when the new ones appear; they
will tolerate shade, even in London, but they do not require it. They love
to be fed repeatedly in spring and summer. In February they are heavenly,
building into clumps which improve yearly, although mice have chewed my
latest white's flowers.
You can divide them, but divisions will take two or three years to settle
in.
You can also grow them in pots, where they look very tempting: Ashwood
confirmed that you should only water them from the bottom by standing them
in a saucer and watering it, not by watering the soil directly from above.
I hope the place and its Hellebores break all the rules, except immaculate
neatness, and continue to prove my one attempt at sector-analysis to be
right.
I also recall another Arthur Hellyer rule: great gardening enterprises tend
to rely on pairs, each half of which needs the other.
At Ashwood, Massey needs Baulk, the master breeder, and both will need
Kevin, active with the Hellebores and Philip, who they snatched from a
career servicing aircraft.
They do not reckon much to horticultural college training: how can you teach
a passion for plants? Could they also teach me tidiness? After brief
consideration, they regretted that tidiness, too, was brought to the job,
not learned on it.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Skiing in the deep freeze: Arnie Wilson finds the going
tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT Round the World Skiing Expedition has crossed the ice curtain:
temperatures in Montana suddenly plunged and as the weatherman said: 'Nice
weather today if you're a husky.'
The Arctic conditions coincided with our faithful car - nicknamed Spud
because of its Idaho plates - giving up the ghost. The frozen Montana
wastelands are no place for a car with a flat battery.
'She's dead as a rock,' pronounced the mechanic hurriedly despatched from
Bozeman airport to Big Sky ski resort, where our own batteries had been
topped up with some exhilarating skiing.
A blue replica of Spud arrived on a low-loader, but my companion Lucy
Dicker, in the grip of a severe migraine, was scarcely aware that we had
changed cars.
This delay meant we arrived at Bridger Bowl just in time for me to ski its
famous ridge. This involves a steep, 25-minute climb, skis strapped to your
back, before trudging along a narrow ridge to tackle one of dozens of
challenging ungroomed chutes and gullies.
The migraine spared Lucy the ordeal of traversing into the apron - one
section is so steep, narrow and undulating that skiers are advised to grab a
tree known as 'Desperation Pine' if they slip. But like me, Lucy is
determined to ski every day of 1994 and so she struggled from the car to ski
Bridger's lower slopes in freezing conditions.
The following night we began a nightmarish nine-hour drive more than half
way across Wyoming in such freezing conditions that every time a huge truck
hurtled past it enveloped us in a cloud of carbon monoxide vapour.
You could win a skiing holiday for two in Courchevel or Verbier, or
runner-up prizes of malt whisky, by entering the competition which appeared
in last week's Weekend FT (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873
3324).
The expedition's principal sponsors are: Avis; American Airlines; Air New
Zealand; Champagne Mercier; Clarins; Dynamic Skis; Fogg Travel Insurance;
Hewlett-Packard; Luhta; Salomon; Ski The Summit, Colorado; Snow + Rock.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Property: A market for sensible sellers - Prices for prime
houses in central London are recovering fast, with more increases on the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The central London market has re-established itself. Since autumn 1992,
overseas buyers have snapped up prime properties and agents have sold off
almost all the backlog clogging their books at reduced, realistic figures.
The result was a price increase last year of around 10 per cent in the best
areas, much of that in the second half.
Agents expect further increases in 1994 and most see a gentle rise of around
10 per cent - although, in a much-publicised forecast two months ago,
Yolande Barnes of Savills Residential Research predicted 25 per cent in
prime central London. The key factor is how much property will be available.
With housing so affordable but supply short, price rises are inevitable. It
is becoming a sellers' market - but they must be sensible. Buyers have not
forgotten the recession; and if a house is priced too high (which agents
might suggest in order to secure the business), there will not be a sale.
Yet, if the figure is seen as reasonable, they will move quickly and even
pay over the odds if there is competition.
In Chelsea, Lord Bective of Egertons reports four cases when the first
person through the door of a new listing bought at the asking price or
within 2 per cent of it, although he adds that Barnes' mega-bullish forecast
'has put the dampers on the vendors'.
Anthony Lassman, of Lassmans, feels a 20 per cent increase for 'the very,
very prime places' would not be any surprise, with 10 per cent on average.
But remember that, whether buying or selling, everywhere is different.
During last year, the happy news in prime London spread to the fringes of
the centre - such as Hampstead, Islington and Fulham - and to the home
counties. Eventually, it should reach from John O'Groats to Land's End.
In the recession, unsellable new developments and repossessions made things
worse, while a new disease called negative equity cursed sellers who had
bought at the peak. Now, however, this virus is working its way out of the
system as prices rise.
Meanwhile, those who bought early in the 1980s or before, many as first-time
buyers, are taking advantage of the present situation to climb a rung higher
on the housing ladder by moving up to homes with two or three bedrooms.
Then again, the devaluation on Black Wednesday in September 1992 led to
investment-seeking foreign buyers - mainly from Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Singapore - pouring money into new developments or refurbishments in the
best areas.
Now, there is a scarcity of these, says James Wilson of buying agent Wilson
&amp; Wilson, a situation compounded by the lack of new projects because of the
recession.
As first-timers bringing in new money, albeit for the most expensive
properties, the foreigners gave the market a kick-start which then drew in
UK buyers.
Add the lack of houses to buy and, suddenly, a rise in central London of
10-15 per cent by mid-1994 - predicted by Barnes in autumn 1992 but
pooh-poohed by many - looks to be coming true.
Agents in 1993 had their best business for years, clearing old stock at
attractive final prices. Mayfair specialist Wetherell sold two mansions
(Aberconway House and 4 St James's Square) for around Pounds 6m; both were
offered originally for about twice as much. Now, says Simon Edwards of
Winkworth's Pimlico office, the margin between selling and asking prices is
down from 5 to 2 per cent.
In Belgravia's Eaton Square, SW1, the right address adds hundreds of
thousands of pounds to the price. The north side, which catches most of the
sun, is best. Be as close as possible to the majestic central block where
the freeholder of the entire area lives - the Duke of Westminster (who owns
the Grosvenor Estate).
Here, Lassmans has sold a 7,000 sq ft flat, stretching across three houses,
for Pounds 9m for a 20-year lease.
Nearby, in humbler Pimlico, Winkworth reports price rises this past autumn.
A maisonette in Moreton Road, bought in September for Pounds 217,500, was
sold (for family reasons) in November for Pounds 235,000. In Belgrave Road,
a one-bedroom flat went from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 94,000 between July and
November.
In Mayfair (W1), where the Grosvenor Estate also is the main landowner,
Wetherell sees a seller's market in 1994. Last year, houses and flats went
for a third off their 1991/92 prices and the agent sold property worth
Pounds 35m. Now, in only February, it has Pounds 35m of instructions and is
acting in future developments worth Pounds 65m.
In Kensington, large family houses on the Phillimore Estate (W8) have passed
the Pounds 1m mark again to stand at 1989 levels, if not yet at the all-time
high of August 1990. The bottom end is back to peak levels as first-time
buyers and family trusts look for Pounds 200-300,000 houses for letting or
personal use.
At the very bottom a small, one-bedroom flat costs around Pounds 80-90,000
and a one-bedroom house Pounds 150-180,000. A garage adds Pounds 20-30,000.
Agents expect the next growth area to be the Pounds 500-600,000 mid-range.
Farther out in Fulham (SW6), John D. Wood's Brian Bishop reports there was a
desperate shortage of houses a month ago. Three went to best and final
offers, selling at 5 per cent over the asking prices. Stock is better now,
though.
In Hampstead (NW3), prices at the top end stopped rising early in 1988 and
then fell steadily for five years, says Marc Goldberg, of Hamptons. In
mid-1993, the tide turned and prices have risen about 10 per cent. Goldberg
expects a further rise of 10 per cent 'or possibly more' this year if the
supply continues thin. Prices could reach mid-1988 levels, but not the early
1988 peak.
St John's Wood (NW8) and Primrose Hill (NW1/NW3) are selling well, says
Patricia Greenstone, of John D. Wood. 'We have a market now. You can be
confident of getting your price. Ridiculous offers Pounds 100,000 below the
asking price are over.' The only cloud is Regent's Park, where flats in the
terraces have been slow for the past two years because of uncertainty as to
what the Crown Estate will do about extending the leases.
Meanwhile, for a long-term perspective, consider 2 Wyndham Place, W1, a
late-Georgian listed house where Somerset Maugham once lived. It is under
offer, at a guide price of Pounds 595,000, through Chestertons Residential.
The seller is the Greater London Fund for the Blind - which bought the house
in 1952 for Pounds 7,600.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Property: How to beat the greedy gazumpers - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With markets rising in London, gazumping could re-appear. Gazumping happens
when, after accepting an offer but before exchange of contracts, the vendor
rejects it to accept a higher offer.
The disappointed buyer then blames the vendor's agent although, often, it is
not the agent who is at fault.
Can anything be done to ensure vendors behave properly? Yes. Make your offer
conditional upon the vendor signing a 'lock-out' agreement.
This binds them not to accept any other offer for a stated period (although
it does not stop them showing other potential buyers around in case the deal
with you should fall through).
Buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, which has overseas clients who come a long way
to view properties, insists on these agreements. They promise that the buyer
will exchange contracts within 10 working days (two weeks) of receiving the
draft documentation. If that does not happen, the deal will almost certainly
lapse.
Meanwhile, inner London homes for sale include:
46 Clanricarde Gardens, W2. A superbly decorated flat near Notting Hill Gate
tube station. Pounds 195,000 for a 104-year lease. The agent is Egerton
(071-584 7020).
81 Peel Street, W8. A small house between Kensington High Street and Notting
Hill Gate for Pounds 290,000. Savills (071-221 1751).
38 Ringmer Avenue, SW6. A terrace house in Fulham with conservatory and
garden. Pounds 295,000. John D. Wood (071-731 4223).
9 The Mount, NW3. A Georgian house in the heart of Hampstead, with double
garage. Pounds 552,500. Hamptons (071-794 8222).
29 Percy Street, W1. A handsome, mid-Georgian house between Charlotte Street
and Tottenham Court Road. Pounds 650,000 (down from Pounds 700,000). William
H. Brown (071-636 2736) or Winkworth (071-240 3322).
17 Upper Grosvenor Street, W1. A large, first-floor Mayfair flat in a former
gentlemen's club with panelled drawing room. Pounds 675,000 for a 58-year
lease. Wetherell (071-493 6935).
29 Clabon Mews, SW1. A 1985 mews house with garage behind Cadogan Square.
Pounds 750,000 for 66-year lease. Egerton.
70 Eaton Square, Belgravia SW1. On the north end of the square's west side,
a first-floor flat with two splendid reception rooms and view down the
length of the square. Needs a complete overhaul. Pounds 1.35m for a new
20-year lease. Lassmans (071-499 3434).
27 Melbury Road, W14. A 1965, Georgian-style house with double garage and
off-street parking for three/four cars. Pounds 2.3m for 71-year lease. John
D. Wood (071-727 0705).
Last month, the river Lavant brought the worst flooding in 130 years to
Chichester, West Sussex. The river also runs through the nearby village of
East Lavant where, for around Pounds 500,000, Henry Adams &amp; Partners
(0243-533 377) is selling Paxtons, an 18th century brick and flint house in
two acres. Paxtons does not flood. It is on higher ground, and even the
cellars stayed dry during the deluge.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: Ice skaters turn up the heat - The red-hot drama at
Lillehammer / Winter Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skating is the story of the winter Olympics, which start today in
Lillehammer, a little town in Norway 120 miles north of Oslo. The hot news
includes the return of Torvill and Dean; the physical attack on America's
ice belle, Nancy Kerrigan; and the re-appearance of German star Katarina
Witt - once described, memorably, as 'sex on skates'. All are themes that
will have global audiences glued to their television screens.
British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won gold medals in
the 1984 Olympics. Judges gave them unanimous 6.0s for artistic merit as
they glided around the rink to Ravel's stirring Bolero. Their 100 per cent
score is unique. Since then, they have been professionals, taking their own
highly-profitable ice show on tour from the tropics to the Arctic.
They are taking a huge gamble in Norway, though. Revision of the rules by
the International Skating Union allows professionals such as Torvill and
Dean, Witt and US male gold medallist Brian Boitano to bid once more for
glory at an 'amateur' level. But it does not explain why they feel compelled
to do it.
Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the women's individual gold medal in 1992 at
Albertville, does not understand. She says she cannot imagine why anyone
would turn their backs on the certain rewards of professionalism for the
plain fare and butterflies of a fortnight at Lillehammer (pop: 23,000).
Since December, Torvill and Dean's comeback trail has included wins at the
British championships and victory - by the narrowest of margins - at the
more demanding European titles in Copenhagen. But no one ever has returned
to the Olympics after a decade and won gold.
To this, Dean retorts: 'Obviously, we think we can win. Jayne wouldn't be
trying if we didn't think it was possible. We're not doing this to make up
the numbers. It's costing us a lot of money, possibly into six figures if
you include lost professional opportunities.
'We've been skating solidly for 10 years and we're better than we were in
1984. Doing six numbers a night in an ice show is harder work than one
four-minute number. We've developed artistically and our stamina is just as
good.'
Their four-minute turn in Norway will be as a virtual reincarnation of Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers, sashaying to the swing notes of Let's Face the
Music and Dance. New ISU rules ban such highly-wrought routines as Bolero;
the new ones are much lighter in tone.
Despite that, Witt is performing her routine to the idealistic 1960s' ballad
Where Have all the Flowers Gone? Gold medallist in 1984 and 1988, she is
only 28 and claims her return to the Olympic front-line is in pursuit of
global peace.
Witt's recent progress, however, has been as erratic as the world's quest
for harmony. She fell heavily when unveiling her new programme at a
Frankfurt show, managed only second in her national competition, and burst
into tears when a lacklustre showing in Copenhagen left her no higher than
eighth.
Yet, her supporters within skating - and they are legion - insist that
Witt's forte always has been artistic and emotional expression on the ice.
Triple jumps may be left to the youngsters but 'Kati' can bring on the
tears, especially for the big event.
Little by way of choreographed drama, though, could match the attack in
Detroit last month on US skater Nancy Kerrigan. She was competing at her
country's national championships and attempting to qualify for Lillehammer.
As the glamorous Kerrigan sat at the rink-side, an assailant smashed at her
knee with an iron bar. Screaming in pain, she was taken to hospital. Later,
Jeff Gillooly, former husband of Kerrigan's main US rival, Tonya Harding,
admitted his involvement in the assault.
More damning still, Gillooly claimed to federal prosecutors that he,
Harding, her bodyguard Shawn Eckardt and two other men conspired to injure
Kerrigan and keep her out of the Olympics.
Harding has proclaimed her innocence and no independent evidence has been
produced to implicate her. Nevertheless, the US Figure Skating Association
plans a disciplinary hearing while leaving the actual decision as to whether
she can compete in Norway to the US Olympic Association.
Adding to the confusion, one of the most powerful figures in the
International Olympic Committee, Canadian lawyer Dick Pound, has suggested
that while the matter remains in legal limbo, Harding should be allowed to
take part.
Harding herself has launched a Dollars 20m lawsuit against the USOA and
sought an injunction restraining it from taking any action to discipline her
before the resolution of any legal proceedings arising from the assault. US
team spirit in Lillehammer should prove interesting.
Kerrigan, meanwhile, seems to have emerged with her position enhanced. She
has been pronounced physically and mentally fit for the Olympics, and it is
inconceivable that a team selector would keep her on the bench.
After watching her perform at a practice rink, US Olympic official Chuck
Foster said: 'If there were any doubt or any questions about Nancy
Kerrigan's skating condition, she answered them for us totally.'

FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: The lesson for a six-year-old - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kane Jackson, aged six, is a football prodigy - according to his agent,
anyway. Whatever the merits of that, it is clear the lad has already
mastered the key elements of modern professional sport: the agent and a boot
contract; a disarming, photogenic smile; and a level of public exposure for
which most endorsement-hungry professionals would kill.
There is just one obstacle to a glittering future. Kane wants to sign for
Manchester United.
United manager Alex Ferguson boasted this week about his rich crop of
teenage talent. This includes four members of the England squad that won the
European under-18 tournament last summer - Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Paul
Scholes and Chris Casper.
Then there is Kevin Gillespie, a slight, tricky winger from Northern Ireland
who looked the best of the lot as United's youth team marched to the FA
Youth Cup final last season. Inevitably, tabloid newspapers have dubbed
Ferguson's youngsters his 'babes' - an echo of United's greatest team, the
Busby Babes, destroyed in the Munich airport crash 36 years ago last week.
These youngsters have been given first team squad numbers, and they train
and travel with the first team. Even so, this season they have made just two
first-team appearances between them, both as substitutes: Butt in the league
against Spurs and Neville against Galatasaray in Istanbul when the European
Cup tie was already lost.
Compare that with the other members of the European Under-18 squad. Robbie
Fowler was in the Liverpool first team, and the club's top scorer, until he
broke his leg. Julian Joachim is a regular, when fit, at Leicester City,
while Darren Caskey and Sol Campbell have started most of Tottenham's games
this season.
It could be that youngsters playing against seasoned professionals are more
susceptible to injury. And, after United beat Spurs at White Hart Lane,
Ferguson noted that Tottenham's young players looked tired. Their manager,
Ossie Ardiles, agreed - but added that the experience they were getting
would make them better players.
The problem is that picking teenagers is a risk, not just to the players but
to the progress of the team - and Ferguson rarely takes that risk. Indeed,
his squad contains only three established players who came through United's
youth team: Ryan Giggs; Lee Sharpe, who cannot win a place in the first
team; and Mark Hughes, whose Old Trafford career has been broken by spells
at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Ferguson has always preferred to buy the
finished article.
Earlier this season he sold his son, Darren, a skilful midfielder to Wolves.
Darren's chances of first team football had largely disappeared with the
arrival of the expensive Roy Keane from Nottingham Forest. Keane is just six
months older than Darren - yet, by the end of last season, he had played 114
games in the top division for Forest, while Darren, a Scottish under-21
international, had played just 24 for United.
In spite of Ferguson's team romping clear at the top of the Premier league,
he cannot have forgotten the experience of two years ago when more or less
the same squad looked a championship certainty but capitulated after Leeds
put on the pressure.
If he cannot work out how to keep winning while giving his youngsters
experience, they could find in a few years that their manager, needing
battle-hardened players in their positions, has gone out and bought such
veterans as Joachim and Caskey to fill them.
The lesson seems clear: if Kane Jackson really wants to play for United, he
should become a junior at Forest.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: Quick, quick, quick . . . slow - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Wednesday's one-day international in Barbados marking the start of
international cricket action between England and the West Indies, there are
some unusual concerns in the home camp.
Most particularly, with the first Test starting on Saturday in Bridgetown,
there is uncertainty about the most effective weapon over the past two
decades - fast bowling.
The four-pronged pace attack that has served the West Indies so well appears
blunter than usual. And this could lead to a fundamental change in strategy,
to be tried first against Mike Atherton's team.
Led by Curtly Ambrose, who has established himself as one of the best fast
bowlers in the game, the West Indies selectors will turn to the consistent
Courtney Walsh and a revived Winston Benjamin for support. But they will be
hard put to make a choice from others.
Andy Cummins, Kenneth Benjamin, Linden Joseph, Barrington Browne, Franklyn
Rose and Cameron Cuffy, to name a few, are all good pacemen. But following
such aces as Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Colin Croft, Joel Garner and
Malcolm Marshall is tough.
The dilemma is forcing some new thinking. Holding says the West Indies can
still have a feared four-pronged attack, even if one prong is a slow bowler.
'If there is a spinner who is good enough, he should play,' he insists.
The problem is that none of the specialist slow men appears ready to fill
the breach. Those who may have aspired to emulate Lance Gibbs, the last of
the great Caribbean spinners, have not been encouraged by the belief of
selectors and spectators that the other test nations are vulnerable only to
the West Indian quicks.
Amid all these anxieties about the bowling against England, skipper Richie
Richardson remains unmoved. 'I am not worried about our attack,' he says.
'We have the best combination in the world.'
He believes that this, plus England's relative inexperience, will undo the
visitors. 'Although they have a good, all-round team, most of them have not
played in the Caribbean before.
'We will win the series. We have the players who can produce the goods and
we will be doing the same thing we have been doing over the years.'
Richardson's confidence could founder on two factors, however. Except for
the Kensington Oval in Barbados, none of the region's Test grounds has a
pitch which helps fast bowlers.
The Bourda Oval in Guyana and the Antigua recreation ground traditionally
are placid. Jamaica's once truculent and inconsistent Sabina Park is now
astonishingly well-behaved. The Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad will take
turn. But, except for part-time spinner Carl Hooper, the West Indies do not
have anyone to take real advantage.
Secondly, Richardson's charges are in danger of being overtaken by tiredness
brought on by too much cricket. Most of them spent last year playing not
only in the West Indies but also in Australia, South Africa, England,
Sharjah, India and Sri Lanka, from which they returned a fortnight before
the start of the domestic season.
Richardson suggested that Ambrose and Walsh should get some rest before the
England tour began - and then was forced to take a month off himself after
his doctor said he had a low blood count and needed to rest.
That was hardly surprising since, over the past year, he had played seven
tests and 28 one-day internationals in 23 different towns and cities, in
addition to his first class and one-day matches for Yorkshire, his English
county.
Meanwhile, as Atherton, leads his team against Barbados this weekend in the
final preparation for next week's international games, he will have noticed
that the leading West Indian bowlers have given little indication of being
tired since the domestic season began last month.
And the established batsmen have been making runs, too. So have several Test
aspirants, who are telling the selectors that they, too, deserve a place.
England beware.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Motoring: Persecute the real sinners
</HEADLINE>

Whatever happened to our sense of proportion? You will be glad to hear that
I am not starting another political column. I am appealing for a little
rationality and a degree of perspective about the latest shock-horror report
on diesel cars, of which more in a moment.
For several years experts have agreed about the environmental merits of
diesel cars. (No, not just motoring writers but real experts such as Ricardo
Consulting Engineers, a world-renowned British automotive industry
think-tank and development laboratory). It has pointed out that because
diesel cars burn around 30 per cent less fuel than comparable petrol-engined
cars in real world conditions, they put less unwanted gases into the
atmosphere.
No-one disputes the fact that diesels produce less carbon dioxide - alleged
to be responsible for global warming - and less poisonous carbon monoxide
than a petrol engine without an exhaust catalyser.
Of course, all new cars with petrol engines have had to have exhaust
catalysers since the beginning of last year. These get rid of the carbon
monoxide emissions but do nothing for the carbon dioxide, which is directly
related to fuel consumption.
And they have to run on unleaded petrol, which contains more benzene than
leaded fuel. Benzene is a known carcinogen with no minimum safety level.
Some medical opinion believes the inhalation of benzene inside and outside
cars could account for childhood leukaemia cases and that leaded petrol, in
which there is less benzene, would be a safer fuel. There is no benzene in
diesel.
Dr Jeremy Vanke, the Royal Automobile Club's environmental manager, has no
axe to grind and recently made a strong case for diesel cars. British
motorists, he said, would help their finances and the environment by
switching to diesel both for long-distance driving and very short trips.
Vanke pointed out that on long journeys, diesels reduced pollution by using
less fuel. On short runs, the catalyser of a petrol engine that was still
warming up did not operate properly. (He could have added that over the
years, catalysers also wear out).
In these conditions, diesels made far less health-threatening pollutants.
(Confirming this, UTAC, a French laboratory, reports that during 2.5
kilometres of urban driving after a cold start, a petrol engine may produce
up to 16 times more active pollutants than a diesel).
With the diesel car's environmental and economic credentials apparently well
established, sales have been soaring. Now QUARG appears to have thrown a
spanner in the works. QUARG stands for Quality of Urban Air Review Group, a
British government sponsored body which is concerned about emissions of
nitrogen oxides and carbon particulates (in other words, smoke) from diesel
engines.
These have, admittedly, been higher in diesels than in petrol engines. But
improved injection technology and the growing use of simple oxidation
catalysers on diesel cars is steadily lowering levels of NOx and smoke.
According to independent research for the Lucas Automotive equipment group,
over the whole life of a car there is little difference in total NOx
emissions. As they age, petrol cars put out more, diesels less. And the
latest Lucas diesel fuelling system used on the Mercedes C220 virtually
eliminates exhaust smoke and particulates in all driving conditions.
One could go on because the issues - air pollution and even the private
car's place in society - are immensely complicated and increasingly
controversial. Instead of seizing upon reports like QUARG's, which seemingly
suggests that the growing switch to diesel cars should be halted in its
tracks, we should look at the situation in the round.
All motor vehicles are mucky and anti-social to some extent. They have
debased life in towns and cities and ruined public transport systems that
once provided cheap, clean and reliable movement. Pedestrians, picking their
way over pavements broken and obstructed by vehicles that have no right to
be there, have become an oppressed minority.
But there is no going back. In the developed world, our lives are completely
dependent upon cars. So, let us try to use them sensibly.
I have driven diesel cars from choice for close to 15 years and shall
continue to advocate their use. I think the QUARG report will be a nine day
wonder.
I cannot see why a car burning at least 30 per cent more benzene-rich
unleaded petrol than my car does of benzene-free diesel is held (as it is by
Professor Roy Harrison, QUARG's chairman) to be preferable in an urban
environment.
A week or two ago I spoke, in a different context, of Mercedes-Benz being in
danger of throwing away the baby with the bathwater through antagonising
mature customers by chasing after younger ones. (My thanks to all those
readers who told me that in German it was: das kind mit dem bade nicht
ausschiffen.)
I would say the same of diesel cars, which cause minimal offence through
NOx, and smoke only slightly.
Instead of saying clamp down on them, let QUARG stimulate action against the
real sinners - the clapped-out antique buses and ill-maintained,
cowboy-driven lorries which spew out more filth per minute than a modern
diesel car does in a month.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Travel: Where you can find the rain in Spain - Adam Hopkins
experiences delight and awe in the Picos mountains of northern Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the future Emperor Charles V inherited the Spanish throne at the age of
17, he immediately set off from Flanders to claim his Iberian birthright.
He went by sea, as many do today. But instead of reaching the port of
Santander, his navigators, who were suitably ashamed at their mistake,
arrived instead off one of the wildest stretches of the Spanish coast,
facing head on, at a distance of six leagues, those fierce and pinnacled
mountains known as the Picos de Europa.
The Lowlands-reared Charles and his courtiers had never seen anything much
higher than a midden, and they were definitely impressed. One look at the
mountains and they concluded that the distance was a single league, not six,
says the Flemish chronicler, Laurent Vidal, describing the events of late
September, 1517.
Today the Picos, although barely 10,000ft high, still leap up behind the
coast in a stunning exhibition of snowy-coloured limestone, offering the
spectator a curious mixture of delight and awe.
They also shelter in their midst a shrine and national park recording the
occasion, in the 8th century, when the Spaniards first defeated the Moors,
who until then had been all-conquering and had made the peninsula an
advance-guard of Islam.
The place is Covadonga, the Spanish victor's name was Pelayo, and the sacred
cave of Pelayo and its numinous Virgin are meant to mark the start of the
centuries-long reconquest from the Moors, giving the Picos range a special
resonance for Spaniards.
You can climb right up these mountains if you have the ropes, hooks and
know-how; or walk in and out among them through amazing gorges; or take high
paths that are reasonably safe and well defined. But if you are just that
fraction more sedentary, you can equally well drive round them in a couple
of days. Naturally, this could be extended to include a walk or two, or
simply to allow more time for taking in the scenery - so long as the weather
is kind.
The possibility of mist and rain is a real one on Spain's Green Coast - why
else would it be green? - but I myself, although properly pessimistic about
the weather in these parts, have made the trip three times in the past three
years, once in summer, twice in winter, and each time under cloudless skies.
On the last occasion I started off from Llanes, a little fishing and holiday
town on the Asturian coast. As well as possessing some excellent beaches and
most of the Picos de Europa, the region of Asturias is famous for its cider.
Rather rashly, considering how curvaceous the roads would be, I had repaired
the previous evening to an excellent little cider house and fish restaurant
in Llanes, called El Riveru.
From there the proprietor, named Manuel Batalla (ready, as his name implied,
for any contest) had swept me off to a festival at a nearby village:
incredibly loud music, much jocund dancing and more cider at every turn.
We wound up in a bar way above the coast where the clientele, at 3am or 4am,
lifted up their heads as one and started on Asturian folk songs about lost
love, drowned fishermen and coal miners buried underground. Tears, I may
say, pricked the eyes; my skin became gooseflesh. And - yes - the road next
morning was even wigglier than I remembered.
From Llanes you trundle along the coast eastwards for a while, the Picos
hidden by a great rib of intervening rock. But soon the route strikes inland
along the banks of the river Deva - boaty, salmony, delectable - to enter a
limestone gorge of shocking beauty and asperity. Griffon vultures wheel
overhead, with specks of eagles stacked up even higher.
Gaunt cliffs and spires of rock come tumbling down, trees grow here and
there in silly places, and the road buckets in and out as you swivel along.
There is a wonderful interruption at the lost little village of Lebena for a
church in the style called Mozarabic - Christians building in the Moorish
manner with horseshoe arches and abstract patterning.
Soon after that the valley broadens, so well-protected by the surrounding
heights that it grows grapes and a mass of Mediterranean plants. Here you
will get the first full view of mountain wall and peaks - those of the
eastern massif, entirely thrilling to the upturned eye.
You could spend the night in the little town of Potes, capital of the
eastern Picos which spill over into the region of Cantabria. There are
hotels and restaurants, and hostales for the young and less affluent. But at
the price of having to come back the same way, it is worthwhile carrying on
through Potes right up into the mountain range, striking for a spot named
Fuente De.
Up here there is a parador, one of Spain's chain of state-owned, state-run
and generally excellent hotels (this one is rather gaunt) and a cable car to
the top of a high rock-cliff, whence even higher expeditions are possible on
foot. The whole place is a mass of rock and thrilling verticals with
meadows, Alpine-style, beneath.
Half-way up from Potes to Fuente De you pass the Hotel del Oso (or Brown
Bear), more comfortable than the parador and serving unquestionably the best
food roundabout. Try their cocido Liebana if you fancy an assault course of
chick peas, cabbage, pork, veal, mountain ham and paprika sausage.
Hacking back now to Potes, and picking up the journey proper along the
southern flanks of the Picos, the road, which grows narrower and
considerably steeper, takes you up and down, over tremendous passes where
you will undoubtedly need at least a layer of warmer clothing if you decide
to take a stroll or picnic. Then down you go, tumultuously, towards the
gorge of the river Cares which climbs up with its attendant walkers through
a world of pitted, water-riven limestone.
It is all tremendous stuff, with great rock skyscrapers and steeples,
sometimes dramatically truncated, and villages in the valleys, stone-built
and red-roofed, looking as if they have been extruded by the countryside,
quite without benefit of human builders.
Eventually, by means of yet another gorge, the road swings round the
north-west corner, offering first Cangas de Onis, capital of the western
Picos, and soon the shrine and national park of Covadonga.
You will no doubt find a good many other visitors before you, but it is
worth pushing on up the Covadonga valley even so, past vast car-parks and
souvenir shops, the commercial apparat of sanctity, to encounter the
minuscule Virgin in her rocky fastness, attended by praying nuns and any
number of determined cyclists, all quite sweaty after the ascent.
There are more hills above Covadonga, extremely steep ones, whether for car
or cyclist, and they lead to a pair of mountain lakes, high at the heart of
the national park.
It is a toss-up whether this northern side of the Picos is more lovely than
the south, but it is certainly better travelled, as you will find when you
get back to the main road and run the length of the range again, this time
from west to east.
Lovely it is, however, and comparatively restful, and it offers access not
only to the peaks above but also, matching the savage aspect of the
mountains, to the strongest, tangiest cheese in all Spain.
This takes its name from the mountain district of Cabrales. It takes its
nature from the milk of sheep, goats and cows combined, and also from the
limestone caverns where it is stored until maturity, acquiring, through
naturally occurring moulds, a taste that rocks you on your heels and makes
the palate throb and tingle.
Cider to start with, limestone in the middle, cheese to finish with - not a
bad sequence for a mountain exploration.
From Britain, the quickest way is to fly from Stansted to Oviedo, capital of
Asturias, on Aviaco, the Iberia subsidiary (London tel: 071-830-0011), three
times weekly, with hire car available via the airline; or fly to Oviedo from
Heathrow or Manchester via Barcelona or Madrid respectively - much less
convenient.
Travelscene (tel: 081-427-8800) has an Asturian programme, with a rather
limited range of hotels in the Picos. There is a much fuller range of hotels
on a Brittany Ferries package, sailing from Portsmouth to Santander,
November to March, and from Plymouth at other times. Two nights on the ferry
(there and back, 24-hour crossing), plus seven nights in Spain, with hotels
and B &amp; B in Picos and approaches, costs from Pounds 226 per person.

Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Dinner time is show time, and everyone makes an effort. Even the waiters.
Diamond stud earrings twinkle, while tortoiseshell alice bands restrain the
'romantik-look' shoulder-length locks favoured in certain Italian quarters,
keeping them out of the soup.
South of the river Main in youth-conscious Sachsenhausen, the anything-goes
rule applies with a vengeance. No-one can match young Frankfurters' skills
in studied scruffiness. The bag-lady principle is heavily applied: five
layers of shirts, vests and waistcoats, all visible and all costly.
Failure to wear jeans at every hour of the day appears to be a mortal
offence. Unbuttoned flannel shirts (the business this autumn) show off
either extravagant underwear on the women or depilated tanned male chests.
Carefully-slit jeans reveal the flesh on both sexes.
The quality improves, but the entertainment-value fades further to the
north, in central Frankfurt's restaurants and beyond in the suburban uplands
of the Taunus hills, where seasonable Steinpilzen cepe mushrooms at DM20
(Pounds 7.60) a mouthful, set off the diners' lingering tans.
Rising numbers of grey pony tails on male heads reflect Karl Lagerfeld's
hero status and the local shortage of barbers not trained in the
slash-and-burn school. But apart from when they are rigged out in black tie
 -every man dressed like a conjuror - the men are a dull lot. Dark suit,
white shirt, long face.
The fluffy jumpers plague appears to have abated among Frankfurt women who
have adopted a nattier style for dinner. It is acceptable to wear a pair of
posh-label jeans coupled with a white cotton shirt and a black blazer in the
stuffiest restaurants.
Jewellery is crucial: emerald earrings, for choice. In keeping with the
times the mood is more modest, but no one wants to go out for dinner only to
be outshone by the waiters.

Once everyone knew what dressing for dinner meant. It was one shade of
importance below dressing for a ball. Men wore a formal dinner-suit (black
tie, no tails) and women wore full-length gowns which, depending on fashion,
age and marital status, might or might not be fairly bare in the shoulder
and bosom regions.
In modern times, however, there is much confusion. If an invitation does not
specify dress, then the hostess, if not the host, will be harassed by calls
demanding just how formal an affair it is likely to be. 'What will you be
wearing?' is the vexed question which pins her down and makes last-minute
changes of mind a source of instant enmity.
It has always been tougher for women. They have excessive choice and their
peers are harsher judges. Among men, a few conservative diehards may expect
other chaps to play by Savile Row rules, but most are, within sensible
limits, unobserving and unjudging of each other's attire. Consequently, as
leisure-time dress codes have relaxed, men's have relaxed faster and further
than women's.
To the eyes of a time-traveller from the first half of the century, most
private London parties in the 1990s would look rather as if milady was
entertaining her female friends and their plumbers, gardeners and general
handymen. While women seize the opportunity to dress up, men grasp at the
chance to dress down.
At well-laden tables from Islington to Chelsea, from Hampstead to Fulham and
from Kensington to Crouch End, the chaps sprawl happily in jeans and shirt
(T-shirt if it is summer, washed silk Equipment version if they are making a
big effort).
The women, on the other hand, will have gone to a lot of trouble. Some will
be wearing cocktail frocks, some long skirts, some trousers. Some will be
bare-shouldered and seriously cleavaged.
Some will merely have piled some costume jewellery on what they wore to the
office. The majority will, once again, be in black - safe, non-aggressively
glamorous. But all will have seen the dinner invitation as inspiration to
some newly-forbidden narcissism, some therapeutic mirror-gazing, lip-liner
and mascara. The 1990s may eschew vulgar display but, in the female of the
species at least, dressing for the occasion is only polite.

Going out to dinner is a very different affair in Japan than it is in Europe
or the US and is definitely not the occasion for serious dressing up.
In Japan, people do not have to worry much about what to wear to a private
dinner party since they are unlikely ever to be invited to one, especially
if they live in a city. This is not unfriendliness but most Japanese homes
are simply not built to accommodate such gatherings.
Casual dinners at a close friend's home are, however, common. Everyone,
including children, gathers to enjoy a sukiyaki pot.
One slightly more formal occasion would be the new year's visit to pay
respects to a company superior or business associate. On these visits, which
often involve eating, drinking and being merry, women might dress in
traditional kimonos or wrap themselves in a silk dress and fur coat. The
more adventurous men might opt for kimono and wooden clogs.
A formal evening dress, tuxedo or tails would turn heads in any restaurant
since such attire is normally reserved for weddings, or in the case of
tails, funerals.
Men, would, more often than not, be found in their familiar suits and ties,
if not a more casual button down shirt and jacket. Three-piece suits are a
rarity while bow ties, sadly, are for the most part only seen on so-called
'talents' who keep the action rolling on late night TV shows or on sleazy
characters pushing cheap thrills in the back streets of Shinjuku.
Among the trendier crowd, fashions for dining can be more diverse and
daring. Designer labels such as Ingeborg, Melrose and Bigi, internationally
acclaimed styles from Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier or Sonia Rykiel, all
sit in stylish restaurants.

York

Deciding what to wear for dinner at a friend's home does not trouble most
New Yorkers. This is because eating out in the city almost always means
eating out at a restaurant - there are approximately 25,000 to choose from
(more per head than anywhere in the world), and Manhattan apartments are
famous for their tiny kitchens.
Dinner parties are as rare as a yellow cab in a Fifth Avenue rainstorm.
Power eating, while not what it was in the 1980s, is still alive and well in
New York, so power dressing should not be far behind. Well, not exactly,
because when it comes to dining out, New Yorkers choose their restaurants
more carefully than they choose their clothes.
Whether you are eating at Daniel Boulud's new Upper East Side restaurant, at
Bouley in Tribeca, or upstairs at Cafe Tabac with Barry Diller and Jack
Nicholson, what you are wearing is not so important as where you are seen
wearing it.
Thus, while eating out at New York's best restaurants can still be one of
life's more glamorous experiences, New Yorkers do not generally make too
much of what they wear to dinner. People just want to be fashionable, and
comfortable.
For women, sophisticated but simply-cut fashions from Donna Karan, Calvin
Klein and Jill Sander are popular, with Comme des Garcons, Dolce &amp; Gabbana
and Giorgo Armani favoured by the younger crowd. Flares, like the city's
cockroaches, are unfortunately everywhere. Three colours dominate - black,
black and black.
Men are more conservative when it comes to dinner wear, and prefer the suits
or jacket-and-trousers combinations they would wear to the office. The
styling, however, can be funkier and looser. Only a handful of restaurants
still insist men wear ties, so tieless buttoned-up shirts under a sharp
sports jacket are common, especially among pony-tailed ad executives.
The most New York of styles for dining out, however, remains what can only
be described as the 'contrarian' look. Contrarian dressing allows you to
wear a Dollars 3,000 Armani suit when dining at a cramped downtown bistro,
and jeans and leather jacket when eating out at a swanky uptown restaurant.
The idea behind it is simple - you stand out from the crowd, but still look
great.

Gone are the days when a fashionable dinner in Paris meant making a
three-star reservation six weeks in advance at a cathedral of haute cuisine
and praying that your slinky Azzedine Alaia number could cope with the
calorific challenge of six or seven courses.
Times have changed. Parisians have not actually gone grungey, but life is
much more casual than it used to be. These days the chicest places to eat
are the guinguettes, the quaint old 1940s music halls along the banks of the
River Seine, or at little village bistros on the fringes of the city,
preferably one where you are on first name terms with the patron.
The clothes are different too. Alaia is out. Anne Demeulemeester, with her
elegant black velvet tunics, is in for younger Parisiennes as is Rei
Kawakubo, of Comme des Garcons, for her exquisite brocade dresses, and
Helmut Lang with his purist trouser suits.
Even the older generation is eschewing the showy styles of the 1980s for a
more subdued 1990s look. Prada's understated suits have supplanted Chanel as
the uniform for less formal dinners and antique couture gowns are being
dusted down for grander events.
Dress codes for men are almost always less strict in Paris than in London.
Black tie is reserved for the most formal occasions. Men of all ages can
wear virtually what they want even to the most expensive restaurants,
although they must always be immaculate.
Younger men tend to favour soft, unstructured suits. Waistcoats are back
this season, although the trademark for the truly fashionable Parisien is to
wear his shirt flapping outside his trousers - and still to look smart.

<TEXT>
One Valentine's morning, I awoke to find a furry bear - sporting a pair of
diamond ear studs - on my doorstep. As romantic gestures go, this scored
full marks for technical merit and artistic impression. Such gifts also last
much longer than chocolates.
But tastes in jewellery are extremely individual and, since the choice of a
Valentine's gift - even more than Christmas or birthdays - is meant to be a
surprise, men who do not know the preferences of their love might be in
difficulty.
Most women's jewellery boxes are cluttered with bijoux that failed to
please. Follow these pointers, however, and you should succeed in combining
surprise with pleasure.
An efficient business woman will, almost certainly, want a jewel as simple
and low-key as her wear-it-and-forget-it Armani and Donna Karan suits. Thus,
Tiffany's gold heart-shaped locket (Pounds 505), a timeless, modern classic
(for mail order, ring 071-409 2790); or designer Eric van Peterson's
stunningly simple, brushed gold effect, heart-shaped drop earrings (Pounds
9.95) from mail-order jewellery company Caura (071-351-7886).
Mothers of small, demanding children enjoy any Valentine pampering as a
welcome relief from Pampers. And those spending time with toddlers soon
discover that a certain indestructibility is not a bad thing in a jewel: for
instance, the Forever Set heart pendants which use an innovative process to
make diamonds appear suspended in mid-air, like Perrier bubbles. By Fior
Dressage, these start at Pounds 150 from Mappin &amp; Webb branches and
Mallory's of Bath.
At the Lesley Craze Gallery, 34 Clerkenwell Green, London EC1
(071-608-0393), fat acrylic hearts in jelly-bean colours, dotted with gold,
will not break the bank at around Pounds 17.
For a woman fond of dogs, horses, children and the countryside, it is wise
to opt for a conventional gem. If money is no object (and you are sure she
wouldn't rather have a new Aga or conservatory), then she is guaranteed to
appreciate Kiki McDonough's amethyst heart earrings, set in 18 carat gold
with tiny rubies and light-catching crystal drops (Pounds 925 from 77c
Walton Street, London SW3 (071-581-1777).
If antiques are more to her liking, Sandra Cronan (18 Burlington Arcade,
London W1, 071-491-4851) is offering an exquisite enamelled gold locket
dating back to 1870. It is decorated with flowers, overlaid with a gold
cherub. Price Pounds 4,600 (071-491-4851).
If she is a bohemian creature who likes to think she's a one-off, her heart
might won with a unique, hand-crafted, and highly individual jewel. First
stop, then, is the studio of mosaic master Andrew Logan (071-407- 6575).
He has mirror heart brooches (sized from 1-2 inches) in dazzling red,
peacock, silver or harlequin colours and priced from Pounds 50.
More extravagant pieces can be found at Electrum (21 South Molton Street,
London W1, 071-629-6325): a necklace of amber chunks, with a heart-shaped
pendant (Pounds 800 plus VAT), or Michael Bateman's modern copper, silver
and brass heart pendant on a silk-braided cord, (Pounds 360 plus VAT).
Any female with the litheness and girlish taste in clothing of model Kate
Moss (but not her bank balance) is unlikely to have graduated - yet - from
affordable silver to the indulgence and grown-up sophistication of real
gold. In which case, suitors would be wise to flick through the new Caura
catalogue (071-351-7886).
This features hallmarked sterling silver rings engraved with romantic
sentiments, or raised hearts on a silver band. These can be worn singly or
several at a time, depending on the depth of your affections and the length
of her digits. Prices are from Pounds 28.50 to Pounds 32.
Prove you are trendy with almost anything from 34-year-old jeweller Dinny
Hall, a former British accessory designer of the year. Valentine offerings
include Moorish silver filigree heart earrings (Pounds 14), or pastel,
semi-precious jewels dangling from tiny heart earrings (Pounds 18.50 for
silver, Pounds 22.50 for gold). Dinny Hall is at 200 Westbourne Grove,
London W11 2RH (071-222-9002).
Her bedtime reading is Vogue rather than Verlaine? She will wear any colour
so long as it's black? French jewellery name Agatha, which has a boutique at
2 South Molton Street, London W1, offers items which confirm that style and
romance are linked inextricably: chunky gilt hearts (Pounds 6) to loop on to
hooped earrings (Pounds 12) or worn hanging from an elegant black velvet
ribbon choker. A matching charm bracelet, with weighty hearts and crosses,
will cost you Pounds 30. (For Agatha's mail order catalogue, call
071-495-2779).
At Clive Ranger, unusual pink diamonds - ranging from delicate pastel rose
to a deeper hue - are fashioned into rings or can be set in a one-off
commissioned design. Prices range from Pounds 360 to Pounds 2,000 at Ranger
shops: 2-4 Castle Arcade, Cardiff; 251 Oxford Street, Swansea; and 6-7 Old
Bond Street, Bath, Avon.
At Verdura, the jeweller in St James's, London, money-no-object options
include an amethyst, gold and diamond heart-shaped brooch, topped with a
gold-and-diamond cupid that will make her putty in your hands; price Pounds
18,000, to order. (Call Harry Fane at Verdura: 071-930-8606).
Last but not least, an inspired alternative to the mushy card you were
planning: a simple, golden, heart-shaped bead from Janet Coles Beads (128
Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3QG; call 0905-755888 for mail order), plus a
fine strip of leather on which to thread it.
*****
Men tend to get a raw deal on Valentine's day. They are expected to provide
flowers and romantic dinners but are lucky if they receive a few anonymous
cards, a bottle of champagne and two painted glasses.
But how does a girl show she cares? The secret is to keep well clear of most
things emblazoned with, or shaped like, a heart, which most men find
tasteless - even embarrassing.
The ideal Valentine present can take two forms: the transient, such as
something delicious to eat or drink, or, more subtly, a romantic
aide-memoire - a personal object that only a loved one could have chosen and
will remind him of the sender.
This was taken to lavish proportions by a French woman who celebrated
February 14 with two portraits - one of herself to hang in her husband's
office, and one of him to grace her drawing room. The idea was that they
would never be too far apart.
Flowers remain the universal love token. While they might make some men
uncomfortable, the more sophisticated are unlikely to feel their virility
compromised. But the flowers should not look feminine and red roses should
be avoided at all costs.
Florist Ming Veevers Carter at Chelsea Gardener (125 Sydney Street, London
SW3; tel. 071-370-0549) creates masculine-looking arrangements and, for the
man who finds flowers outre, she can build fresh, miniature topiary in
assorted shapes and designs. Prices start at Pounds 20.
For a different, affordable luxury, try some soft cotton batiste pyjamas
from Budd (Shirtmakers), 1a &amp; 3 Piccadilly Arcade, London SW1, tel:
071-493-0139). Available in a selection of colours they are made properly
and generously and have contrast piping. Price: Pounds 95.
The romantic dresser will appreciate a silk waistcoat from Orford and Swan
(5 Church Row, London NW3; 071-495-4103). Taken from Beauvais, Aubusson and
Savonnerie designs from the 17th to early-19th centuries, the company's
waistcoats are some of the most elegant on the market. Price: Pounds 315.
When it comes to underwear, remember Calvin Klein is a brand that seems to
have universal appeal to men. Styles range from classic boxers to more
athletic underpinnings at Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, SW1 (071-235-5000).
If choosing a tie, go to Turnbull &amp; Asser, 70 Jermyn Street, London SW1
(071-930-0502). It still sells the best neckwear in London.
Accessories could include enamelled gold cufflinks from Kiki McDonough, 77c
Walton Street, London SW3 (071-581- 1777). Motifs include shooting, fishing,
golf, a camera, dogs, the houses of parliament, monogrammed slippers and a
magician's hat. The workmanship is very good but, at prices from Pounds 975,
these are probably only for the most ardent of admirers.
For a more less costly assortment, go to Paul Smith (41-42 Floral Street,
WC2; 071-379- 7133) where you will find light-hearted cufflinks at good
prices (around Pounds 32) including ovals painted with LO and VE.
If your man's tastes extend to the antique, you could invest in a pen from
Jasmine Cameron at Antiquarious (131 Kings Road, London SW3 (071-351-4154);
the carefully reconditioned collection includes vintage Conway Stewarts,
Shaeffers and Swans ranging from about Pounds 220-260.
If he would appreciate something very personal, buy him a gold love disc
(Pounds 256) from Aphrodisia, 25 Shepherds Market, London W1 (071-499-2901).
Available in three types of gold, you can have it inscribed.
Aphrodisia's chocolates, Avant L'Amour, are delicious and include
ingredients reputed to have aphrodisiac qualities: ginger, which is said to
stir passion; coconut, symbolic of fertility; and Venus's own fruit,
strawberry. Prices start at Pounds 8.
For the man who cooks, there are two suitable recipe books - The Foods of
Love, by Max de Roche (Pounds 8.50), and the charmingly arcane La Cuisine
Aphrodisaque (around Pounds 12.50) which has 200 sensual recipes from
throughout the ages.
The man who needs to be coaxed into a slightly healthier lifestyle might
enjoy a short stay (from Pounds 110) at Claridges hotel, Brook Street,
London W1 (071-629 8860), where male guests can use the exclusive Bath &amp;
Raquets Club. Annabels without the dancing, it is the most civilised and
best-decorated health and fitness club in London.
More modestly, he might enjoy a Health and Fitness Day at Champneys, Le
Meridien, 21 Piccadilly, London W1 (071-437-8114), which costs Pounds 95 a
person and includes use of the swimming pool, whirlpool, sauna, steam room,
squash courts, gymnasium, cardio-vascular room, a supervised workout, lunch,
body massage, facial, manicure and pedicure.
The ideal olfactory Valentine comes from Penhaligons (081-809-7799), which
will engrave scent bottles with entwined initials, two characters with a
heart, or a loving inscription. Prices from Pounds 20.
Finally, two unusual Valentine gifts. The first is a romantic sojourn in Le
Touquet with Love Air, a small airline that flies from Biggin Hill or Lydd
airports in Kent and organises tailor-made holidays in and around the French
coastal resort. Prices start at Pounds 165 a person for flights and a
two-day stay (0279-681435).
The second is musical. The Serenading Service (071-792-1419) will send an
opera singer with guitar accompanist to any venue in central London to
serenade your lover with two choice romantic arias. Prices start at Pounds
250. Definitely for the man who does not mind being the centre of attention,
this present will leave him in no doubt about your intentions.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Cookery: An end to le gateau - Puddings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heaven be praised: proper puddings are back in fashion. Not of course that
any self-respecting Briton was ever over-concerned about fashion. We knew in
our hearts that traditional British cooking had the edge on all that fancy
foreign stuff, but now it is official. Research into restaurant trends
reveals that the reign of that false pretender, the Black Forest gateau, is
finally over. Bread and butter pudding is the 'new' favourite on restaurant
menus. Hurrah.
Closet pudding eaters need hide their preferences no longer. Come out and be
counted. While yesterday's folk toy with crepes Suzette on Shrove Tuesday,
why not celebrate with something more substantial - treacle sponge, Spotted
Dick, Sussex pond pudding, jam roly-poly or queen of puddings.
Consider joining The Pudding Club*. Founded by Jean and Keith Turner eight
years ago, when puddings were becoming endangered species, it welcomes new
members and there is no joining fee. The only requirement for membership is
a love of puddings.
Club meetings, held regularly on Friday evenings, are so popular that places
are booked weeks or even months ahead. The meetings are in fact dinners, at
which seven puddings from the the club's repertoire - about 40 recipes - are
served.
Safeway, the supermarket chain, recently launched six recipes from The
Pudding Club repertoire adapted to cooking on a commercial scale. Its
versions are also designed to appeal to vegetarians, hence the replacement
of beef suet with vegetable suet and palm oil. Pleasingly, however, butter
is used where butter should be. No nasty margarine.
I cannot pretend that Safeway's steamable/microwavable plastic-basined
puddings are on a par with the best home-made, but some of them are a good
deal better than anything I was given at school. I might well buy one or two
as consolation for those left at home when I next go on a business trip.
The syrup pudding - in other words a steamed golden syrup sponge - was
agreeably light and good, though much in need, I thought, of zipping up with
lemon. This was remedied by warming a little extra syrup with some lemon
zest and plenty of lemon juice to pour on at the point of serv-ing.
Sticky toffee pudding, another steamed sponge made with butter, was again
far too sweet and could have been more generously sauced but, basically, it
was appealing. I am prepared to bet it will be a best seller.
I confess I have never been a Spotted Dick fan and this version, though
lavishly fruited, did not convert me.
Oriental ginger seemed to me solid stodge and harshly hot, as though made
with African ginger rather than aromatic Jamaican or Australian.
I had high hopes of Lord Randall but found the noble lord disappointing,
handsome enough but the combination of marmalade and dried apricots it
contained made a curiously bitter marriage.
Jam and coconut pudding sounded off-putting, like the worst of junior school
confections. In fact I liked the moist, slightly scented coconut sponge a
lot. Pity about the jam - too much of it and low grade.
RHUBARB &amp; ALMOND CRUMBLE TART (serves 6)
If you are not yet ready to get your teeth into traditional heavyweight
British puddings, here is a medium-weight stepping stone. This recipe also
offers a good way to settle squabbles about whether a crumble, or a pie, or
a tart, should go on the Sunday lunch menu since it is a hybrid.
For the orange pastry: 4 oz unbleached white household flour; 2 oz wholemeal
flour; 1 well heaped teaspoon of sugar; 1 1/2 oz butter; 1 1/2 oz lard; the
finely grated zest of an orange and about 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed
orange juice to bind.
For the rhubarb and almond crumble: 13-14 oz trimmed weight forced rhubarb
(you will need nearly 1 1/2 lb gross); 4 oz wholemeal flour; generous  1/2
teaspoon ground cinnamon; 3 oz pale muscavado sugar; 2 1/2 oz butter; a
generous 1 1/2 oz flaked almonds plus an extra tablespoon of flaked almonds
to sprinkle over the top.
Make the pastry in the usual way and chill it briefly. Roll it out, use it
to line a 10in to 11in fluted flan tin and chill again. Line it with baking
parchment, weigh it down with beans and blind bake at 400`F (200`C) gas mark
6 for 10-12 minutes. Remove the parchment and beans and bake for 8 minutes
more.
Meanwhile prepare the filling. Whizz the flour, cinnamon and sugar in a food
processor. Cut then rub in the butter and stir in all but one tablespoon of
the nuts. (Everything up to this stage can be done well ahead if wished.)
Cut the trimmed rhubarb stalks obliquely into one-inch lengths. Sprinkle
about one-third of the crumble mixture evenly over the base of the blind
baked tart. Cover with the fruit and sprinkle on the rest of the crumble -
do not press it down. Then scatter the extra almonds on top.
Slide the tart onto a hot baking sheet and bake at 400`F (200`C) gas mark 6
for 35 minutes until the rhubarb is hot and tender but not collapsing and
the almond crumble is crisp. Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving with or
without custard, cream or orange syllabub sauce.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: So, farewell Coonawarra claret - Jancis
Robinson explains a new wine treaty which will have far-reaching effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Considering it produces well below 2 per cent of the world's wine, and is at
least 20 hours' flying time from most of the world's vineyards, Australia
wields an extraordinary amount of influence.
Most obviously, there is a strong Australian element in the training of
'flying winemakers', the swelling band of itinerant oenologists who are
shaping winemaking techniques in developing winelands all over the globe.
Of more long-term importance, perhaps, are the achievements of Australian
viticulturists in the world's vineyards, where they aim to flout the
conventional wisdom that quality and quantity are incompatible. But
signatures in Brussels and Canberra at the end of last month signalled an
important new area of Australian influence, as well as a new era for
Australian wine labelling.
Five years of intense negotiation have resulted in a two-part, 200-page
agreement by which Australia stops using Europe's cherished wine names -
champagne, burgundy, chablis, port, claret etc - at home as well as abroad,
in exchange for EU recognition of its winemaking techniques, its own
analyses, and EU renunciation of the right to use Australian geographical
wine names such as Coonawarra and Granite Belt.
There was a bit of a hiccup when the Portuguese objected to Port Stephens as
an Australian wine region but both negotiating teams are generally thrilled
with the detail of this treaty.
The turning point came when the Australians agreed to stop using the word
champagne (it maybe significant that some champagne houses have investments
in Australian wine). The Australians, on the other hand, clearly feel they
have stolen a march on other New World wine producers in terms of ease of
access of their wines.
They have won concessions on the low natural acidity and high mineral
content of some of their wines, on their naturally sweet wines which have
until now fallen foul of EU law, and on their distinctly un-European habit
of blending the produce of different regions.
But they are particularly smug about their practices which are embodied in
this, the EU's first bilateral wine trade agreement, representing an
important step in the international harmonisation of winemaking techniques.
It has already been used as a model for agreements with Bulgaria, Romania,
Hungary and New Zealand and is likely to provide a framework for
negotiations with such equally keen wine exporters as South Africa, Chile,
and Argentina.
The hardest country to bring into line will be the US, land of Gallo Hearty
Burgundy. It may be the world's fifth largest wine producer, but it has
nothing like Australia's commitment to exports, which now represent almost a
quarter of production worth ADollars 21m (roughly Pounds 10m), expected to
increase to ADollars 1bn by the turn of the century.
Some current Oz favourites chosen specifically to appeal to European
palates:
Goundrey Langton Mount Barker Chardonnay. 1993. Pounds 4.99. Asda. Still one
of the best bargains around, a relatively cool climate Chardonnay. The
Riesling 1991 is equally lively, although delightfully mature, and costs
Pounds 5.49 from Vin du Vin of Appledore, Kent (tel: 0233-83727), La
Vigneronne of London SW7 (071-589-6113), and Andrew Darwin of Kington,
Hereford (04544-230534).
Mt Langi Ghiran Riesling. 1993. Pounds 5.99. Oddbins and Winecellars of
London SW18 (081-871-2668). Fine; see also their Shiraz 1991 at Pounds 7.99.
Heritage Clare Valley Riesling. 1993. Pounds 6.49. Australian Wine Centre,
London WC2 (071-925-0751). Delightfully understated and subtle. Not a trace
of lime sherbet.
Prelude Chardonnay. 1991. Pounds 6.99. Domaine Direct of London WC1
(071-837-1142) A steal. Leeuwin Estate's second label and a wine that hints
broadly at the burgundian style of this top Western Australian Chardonnay at
Pounds 12.50.
Shaw &amp; Smith Sauvignon Blanc. 1993. Pounds 7.99. Oddbins, Adnams of
Southwold, Suffolk (0502-724222) and Winecellars. One of the most convincing
Sauvignons I have ever encountered.
Alkoomi Chardonnay. 1991. About Pounds 10. Castang of Looe, Cornwall
(0503-220359), Howard &amp; Hardman of Chipping Norton 0608-641850. Pure and
sinewy.
Heritage Cabernet Malbec. 1991. Pounds 6.99. Australian Wine Centre. Soft,
alluringly ripe and ready to drink.
Charles Melton Shiraz. 1992. Pounds 8.99. Winecellars. Rich, full,
immediate.
Rockford Dry Country Grenache. 1991. Pounds 9.75. Booths wine stores and
Adnams. Sweet, alcoholic, round, lightly oaked. A delicious gulp.
Henschke Abbott's Prayer Merlot/Cabernet. 1990. Pounds 11.99. Lay &amp; Wheeler
of Colchester (0206-764446). Subtle, and approachable.
Coldstream Hills Reserve Pinot Noir. 1992. Pounds 11.99. Oddbins The most
exciting Pinot yet to come out of Australia. Waitrose will have the
Cab/Merlot 1991 at Pounds 8.49.
Petaluma Coonawarra Red. 1988/1990. Pounds 9.99. Oddbins, Bottoms Up and
Wine Rack. As close as Coonawarra gets to claret.
Penley Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. 1990. Pounds 12.99. The Wine Treasury of
London SW6 (071-371-7131). Gorgeous, mellow, top quality.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Say it with chocolates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is cheaper than champagne, and more environmentally friendly than
rhinoceros horn. You can eat it, drink it, cook with it, sculpt it or,
following the example of contemporary artist Anya Gallaccio, melt 325 bars
and paint your walls with it. Chocolate - even for the less avant-garde - is
rightly among the most popular of Valentine's Day gifts.
The quality and variety of chocolate available in the UK has increased
greatly in recent years. Thornton's Confectionery has nearly 500 outlets
throughout the UK. For Valentine's Day, it will ice a message of your choice
on to a chocolate heart, which, at Pounds 2.99 including the presentation
box, is hardly more expensive than a card.
Belgian chocolate maker Godiva is famous for a high quality couverture and a
characteristic praline filling. The pralines, moulded into Valentine hearts
and covered with milk or dark chocolate, are available individually or in
lavish quantity, boxed in red and gold (Pounds 15 per lb). Godiva's range
also includes fillings of marzipan, liqueur, and fresh cream. Dame Blanche
is a dark chocolate cup filled with coffee cream and a walnut half, covered
in white chocolate. Godiva's main shop in the UK is at 247 Regent Street in
London, with concessions at Selfridges and Harrods, and there are 1,400
outlets worldwide.
If your tastes run to the more erotic, Aphrodisia in London's Shepherd's
Market (071-499 2901) offers a chocolate selection pointedly called Avant
l'Amour, at Pounds 8 for a  1/2 lb box. Vanilla, coconut and ginger are used
in the centres.
The most exclusive maker of fine British chocolate is Charbonnel et Walker,
established in 1875 and still retaining the grace of an earlier age.
Charbonnel's presentation boxes have been collectables since the days when
they came with tiny silver tongs, to prevent the soiling of evening gloves
and any unseemly rustling of paper in the dress circle.
C&amp;W's boxes, from a miniature two-chocolate size to a 10 lb box, are still
hand-made: covered in coloured silks, moire or Liberty print, and charmingly
trimmed. Charbonnel's range includes a paradisal strawberry white truffle,
and lips and hearts moulded in solid milk, plain or white chocolate. You
could spell out your love in letters from a chocolate alphabet (all Pounds
16 per lb).
C&amp;W's single shop is at 1 The Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, London, W1X
4BT and there is a mail order service (071-491-0939).

FT  12 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The secrets of Thai cuisine - Nicholas
Woodsworth enrols on a challenging and enjoyable cookery course in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have never had much time for Bangkok. A heaving, clamorous monster of a
city that has slipped its leash, it seems permanently out of control. It
grows and grows, and continues to grow. It is unstoppable. It thrives on
money and fat-cat generals and rotten business deals and veniality. It eats
people and belches blue smoke.
Worst of all, from the traveller's view, it deadens the senses of the
unsuspecting visitor. After their first two-hour traffic jam between airport
and hotel, many people just switch off. Whenever I am in transit in Bangkok,
I lie low and simply pretend the whole thing isn't there.
At least, that is the way it was until I noticed the little cluster of food
carts parked each day outside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. They are nothing
special - battered, three-wheeled aluminium pushcarts with tin roofs for the
rain, car batteries and fluorescent tubes for lighting, and butane canisters
and gas rings for cooking.
They are found on almost every street corner. But to judge from the happy
faces of the commuters on their way to and from the crowded ferries on the
Chao Phya River, they were giving great pleasure and satisfaction in an
otherwise hectic routine.
No matter how chaotic their city has become, Bangkok's citizens retain a
reputation for aesthetic and sensual appreciation. Outside on the street the
diesel fumes may be thick and the traffic snarled, but in their souls the
Thais, a creative and expressive people, continue to enjoy life through
their considerable artistic and social skills - through their love of
conversation and company, through religion, art, music, and, most famously
in the west at least, through the creation of a surprising and delightful
cuisine.
But how in the midst of this smoggy streetside mayhem, I wondered, could
anyone enjoy food? I was interested enough to wander over to the carts and
sit down.
The scene was strictly Asian urban minimalist - metal tables and chairs on
the sidewalk, a plastic bucket for dish washing in the gutter, Coke cases
stacked against the wall. Nor did the food itself look like much; when I
pointed vaguely at the first pot at hand, what was placed in front of me in
a plastic bowl looked like a green, sludgy and nondescript stew. I could not
have been less expectant.
But the moment I put a spoonful in my mouth I knew that this was worth
exploring. Here were fresh, lively, unfamiliar flavours - chillies and
pungent herbs, sharp lemon and milky coconut tastes, sweetness and subtle
spicing. All blended wonderfully, transforming ordinary chicken. Thai green
curry showed me that there is little time to waste in Bangkok after all.
A good way to get to know a food is to eat it. Even better is to cook it.
But getting to know Thai food presents problems to the westerner. Many
ingredients - roots, leaves, chillies, fermented concoctions of fish and
shrimp, liquid extractions of fruit-pods and trees - are so strange and
exotic most of us do not even know how they look, much less how they are
used.
More challenging still, the flavour combinations produced in Thai cooking
are wholly unexpected and take a leap of the imagination that not everyone,
at first, might have. Nor do Thai cooking methods much resemble anything in
the west - when was the last time you used a pestle and mortar, or steamed
food in a banana leaf?
Put all these elements together, add the problem of language, and you are
left with one solution: going back to school. After tasting green curry I
enrolled at the Thai Cooking School at the Oriental.
There is no sweaty-palmed swotting in the Oriental's classrooms. For the
next five mornings I was ferried over the Chao Phya River in a hotel launch;
awaiting me on the other side, in an old-fashioned colonial building
surrounded by tropical gardens, was a small class and Sarnsern Gajaseni,
cookery instructor.
Sarnsern believes that cooking, like eating or any other worthwhile
endeavour, should provide pleasure. But the greater the knowledge, he
admits, the greater the pleasure.
Thai food is like nothing else on earth. At the crossroads of south-east
Asia, this country has borrowed from the two cultural giants that loom over
it. From China it has taken ingredients such as noodles and techniques such
as stir-frying. From India it learned about about the use of spices in
giving subtlety and infinite variety to even the simplest of foods. Nor is a
western colonial element missing - Thai cooking would be unrecognisable
without the hot chilli, gift of the Portuguese who brought it from South
America.
What sets the seal on Thai cuisine, though, are the country's distinctive
local ingredients. Sarnsern spends time familiarising students with their
look, feel and taste. I already knew coconut, garlic, and soy sauce, but am
now more at home with a score of other Thai indispensables - lemon grass,
coriander, tamarind, basil, Thai ginger and kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce,
shrimp paste and others. I can even judge, approximately, the various
firepower of half a dozen different kinds of chilli.
Knowing what to do with them all is, of course, another matter. The best way
is to watch someone who does.
Part of this involves learning simple techniques of manipulation. Ninety per
cent of time in Thai kitchens is spent in preparation rather than actual
cooking - rarely more, for most dishes, than 10 or 12 minutes. The fine
slicing of vegetables, chopping of meat or pounding of fresh herbs requires
little specialist skill. But how, for example, do you extract the
delightfully tart and fresh flavour of tamarind from a sticky mess of seed
pods, or make two kinds of milk, thick and thin, from the meat of the
coconut?
There are tricks and tips to be learned that can make Thai cooking
convenient in the west without de-naturing it too far. For example one need
not extract, grate and hand-squeeze fresh coconut meat two separate times to
obtain two kinds of milk. It is much easier, I discovered, to stick a tin of
coconut milk into the freezer - it will separate itself, the thick milk
rising to the top. Or, if fresh Thai spices are unavailable, I know now that
soaking them in water and lemon juice before use will bring out more
flavour. And, if time is really tight and I cannot make my own fresh Thai
curry paste, I know how to liven up a commercially-prepared paste with a few
ingredients.
The real skill of the Thai cook, however, lies not in physical technique,
but in the complex and carefully calculated combination of flavours he gives
to his sauce, dip, soup salad and curry bases. Thai cooking requires only
small quantities of meat, fish, poultry or seafood, and the vegetables used
are generally bland - everything rests on the inspired but judicious use of
herbs, spices and condiments.
The days slipped by and we worked our way through the Thai repertoire. We
watched the construction of fiery dips made of chillies, fish sauce, lime
juice and palm sugar; mild dips of shrimp paste, coconut milk, and smoked
fish; hot and sour soups using prawns and Thai ginger, coriander root and
basil, spinach and dried shrimps; spiced salads of squid and mint, lime
leaves and shallots, chillies and lemon grass.
By the time we got to the deep-fried noodles, the steamed dishes, the
stir-fries and the oil and coconut-based curries - to my mind the apex of
Thai cooking - we were over our astonishment at incongruous-sounding
combinations; salty, sweet, sour, and hot - all flavours can be combined to
happy effect as long as there is a harmonious balance. We had also learned
not to be afraid of keeping hot dishes hot with their full compliment of
chillies - such dishes are never meant to be eaten alone, but found on the
table with milder, cooling fare.
Perhaps the most agreeable principle to be learned in Thai cooking is that
there are no hard and fast rules. Thai cooks operate on personal taste and
the intuition that comes from experience. Where one household might use
three spoons of lime juice for a particular dish, the house up the road
might use six and the one opposite none, or wine vinegar instead.
How does the enthusiastic amateur get the experience to allow full play to
his or her creativity and intuition? Sarnsern advises three procedures. Get
and use a good cookbook. I have bought Vatcharin Bhumichitr's The Taste of
Thailand, (Asia Books, Pounds 10.99, 223 pages), and find it excellent. Work
by experimentation, using small quantities of spices at first and gradually
increasing them according to preference. Last, expose yourself to as much
good Thai food as possible. It is a good reason, I think for heading back to
that monster of a city.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Balancing the book - A publisher
putting profit second
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUZANNE ASKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A publisher producing just one book a year sounds a most unpromising
proposition, but Shirley Jones of the Red Hen Press has seen her business
expand from a housewife's hobby to a respected concern with good prospects
for the rest of the 1990s.
'My products matter more than my profits,' says Jones who has combined an
English degree with art school courses to become a writer, illustrator and
printer of artists' books, working from a studio at her south London home.
She may produce only one book a year, and print only 40 copies of it - but
with each book retailing for an average of Pounds 500 (special designer
bindings are sometimes added at extra cost), profits are appearing.
The pace is slow, however, as the books can take years to sell: Jones
supplements her income by selling prints from the books for an average of
Pounds 40 to Pounds 60, and by lecturing at universities.
Jones began producing artists' books at a loss during the mid-1970s, and it
was not until 1983 that the Red Hen Press became a commercial concern and
began to pay for itself.
Before then, she spent Pounds 1,000 on printing equipment, and bought her
materials - hand-made paper and inks costing about Pounds 400 a year - from
family savings.
Prints accounted for 66 per cent of turnover before 1983, and books the
rest. Books sold for an average of Pounds 200, and only 12 to 25 copies of
each were produced.
Prices were calculated simply by looking at what Jones reckoned the market
would stand and disregarding her own labour costs.
'Even now, I calculate that I pay myself only Pounds 3.50 an hour,' she
said.
In 1983, turnover reached a modest Pounds 5,000, of which the sale of books
formed 90 per cent. This financial shift followed a decision to market the
books personally around American universities and art libraries.
'I spent, and still spend, Pounds 1,500 per annum on that. Other overheads
have been low in comparison - just Pounds 500 a year - as I work from home,'
said Jones, who now employs a part-time assistant, usually an art student,
during the hectic printing period.
Since the 1980s, the Red Hen Press has published a wide range of titles,
including translations of Welsh and Old English poetry, and original poems
about Jones's Welsh homeland, cats, wildlife and other subjects.
During this period she made a financial mistake which alarmed her so much
she made a further change of strategy: 'I used to commission one-off
designer bindings for a few books before trying to sell them,' she
explained.
'But in 1989 I commissioned a design which turned out not at all like my
brief, and was more expensive than I had expected - almost Pounds 1,000. I
paid, but the book still hasn't sold, and since that time I've never
commissioned designer bindings except on order.'
By placing her product above commercial considerations, Jones has been
building her reputation as a serious book artist. This is the prime selling
point of her business, and can be regarded as a long-term investment which
looks likely pay off during the rest of the 1990s.
Turnover this year is still modest, at Pounds 10,200. Total outgoings come
to Pounds 4,200, of which 66 per cent is spent on production, 23 per cent on
marketing, and the remainder on overheads.
But as Jones's name becomes better known, profits look likely to rise:
second-hand copies of her books are already selling for more than their
original retail price.
Jones's buyers are predominantly universities, art libraries and museums,
including the British Library, the Victoria and Albert, the Guttenberg
Museum in Germany, and many American universities.
'I also sell a certain amount, around 5 per cent, to private collectors,
usually through a dealer, who takes one third of the price in profit.'
This year could prove a springboard year for the Red Hen Press for two
reasons. First, Jones's husband Ken recently retired from his post as head
of personnel at Reuters Europe. Now a personnel consultant, he is spending
about a third of his time on marketing his wife's business.
Second, the business is to move to Wales as Jones has been awarded a grant
of Pounds 4,300 by the Development Board of Rural Wales towards the cost of
converting part of her existing Welsh home into a studio and office, giving
more space while reducing overheads.
She plans to employ a part-time printing assistant, and a part-time office
worker.
Husband Ken explained: 'While never forgetting that future business plans
are secondary to artistic development, we are planning to increase our
income from the sale of cards and poetry books, as well as from a few more
lecture tours.'

FT  12 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A break for coffee - A man
causing a stir in street catering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If David Humphries has his way, the dingy street carts which dispense greasy
hamburgers, hot dogs and onions on the streets of London will be replaced by
sleek machines dispensing coffee and croissants. Humphries, a former
journalist, believes London is under-espressoed.
For such a gastronomic transformation, the British public would thank the
people of Seattle, Humphries' home town, which is now the coffee capital of
the US.
Humphries, a former employee of the Associated Press news agency and senior
editor at Penthouse magazine in New York, came to the UK in 1989 when his
wife was posted to London by her company. Having left Seattle in 1984 he
noticed on return visits that the city was becoming gripped by coffee-mania.
This began in 1982 when Nordstrum, the city's biggest department store,
opened an espresso cart outside its main store. Others were quick to follow
and soon there were more than 1,000 carts. Today, the downtown area is said
to have a cart every 300ft and there is even one on a boat to service the
yachts in the city's port.
Two factors accounted for this growth, explosive even in a country where
coffee is the national beverage. The first was the popularity in Seattle of
latte, a drink of hot, steamed milk added to espresso topped with milk
froth. Second was the arrival of Italian syrups - such as almond, cinnamon
or hazelnut - with which to flavour cappuccinos. Drinking Italian-style
coffee became fashionable and Seattle even has drive-in espresso carts.
Set-up costs are relatively low. In Seattle, about Dollars 10,000 buys (from
one of the city's 40 manufacturers) a cart that includes a sink with running
water, a drainage tank, refrigerator, water storage tank and electric power
panel. Then you need a power supply, a permit, and somewhere to park the
cart at night. And, most importantly, the right site - as Humphries was to
discover.
When, on a subsequent trip to Seattle, he heard of an espresso cart which
had paid for itself after a month because of its location, he placed an
order for one to be shipped to London early in 1992. But, on returning to
look for a site, he ran into a big problem.
His preferred sites - outside the Tate Gallery, on Oxford Street or
Piccadilly - were vetoed by local councillors. No new permits for street
carts were being issued, and existing ones were guarded jealously by those
who held them.
The imminent arrival of his cart forced Humphries into taking a site inside
the London Pavilion at Piccadilly Circus.
Then he discovered the King's Road shopping mall in Chelsea and tried to
convince its manager of the profit they could share from an espresso cart -
but instead he walked out a restaurateur.
Regulations forbade any carts dispensing food and drink, but the basement
restaurant was being vacated, so Humphries moved in to convert Londoners to
flavoured cappuccinos and lattes.
A friend from Seattle helped him develop a blend after a month during which
they sat through 14 different tastings at a coffee specialist in Soho.
Today, with four outlets - the others are in the Plaza shopping arcade,
Oxford Street, in the heart of the West End, plus two carts in the City at
the Broadgate development, next to Liverpool Street station  - he has a
monthly coffee bill of more than Pounds 2,000. In its first year, the
company's turnover was Pounds 340,000; in its second, it is on track to top
Pounds 1.5m.
Margins on an espresso are big: a 3p cost turns into a 60p sale, and returns
from one operator can be big. If the site is right, the daily gross profit
can be Pounds 200-300. But the number of customers must be high and
consistent.
Humphries had one setback: a fifth outlet in Camden Town proved unsuccessful
because the area is busy only on Saturdays and Sundays. As a result, he
closed it after Christmas. But in the basement of the Plaza arcade, where he
pays 18 per cent of gross turnover as rent, the site is very busy throughout
the week - particularly as it is located right opposite the down escalators.
Humphries' original espresso cart finally found a home in March 1993 at
Broadgate (for which he needed permission from the developer, not the
council). At 7am, queues of office workers wait for the kiosk to open and it
stays busy until 8pm, seven days a week - especially now the development's
ice rink is open.
Spurred by such slogans as 'Cappuccino makes you smarter than you really
are]' customers buy more than 1,000 cups of coffee on a busy day.
Having found that office workers are a perfect market, Humphries would like
to operate espresso carts in a ring around Liverpool Street. Having now
designed his own cart, he is negotiating to place them in such outlets as
department stores and cinemas - even with a transport company. And, in March
1995, he plans to install a cart in a shopping mall in Calais, France.
Humphries has no desire to control a large organisation and has his eye on
granting franchises. He cites Grinding it Out - written by Ray Kroc, the
founder of McDonald's - as one of the seminal books of the 20th century, and
believes that espresso carts selling up-market, high-quality food and drink
could well be the franchise vehicles of the 1990s.
There is another compelling reason for that. Humphries says an espresso
cart, fully equipped and ready to roll, should cost less than Pounds 20,000
 -rather less expensive than the sum you need to open a McDonald's
franchise.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN

<TEXT>
Michael Portillo, number two in the British Treasury, created a stir
recently when he told students that if they got good examination results it
was not because they had bribed anyone, and if they won contracts it was not
because of their relationship with government ministers.
That was the sort of thing that happened abroad, he said. In the ensuing
uproar, unfortunately, most of the allegations were withdrawn.
But, as others have pointed out, in Britain, alone in Europe, you can buy
good examination results by opting out of the state system. In France or
Germany to do such a thing for your offspring would mean they were dim, in
need of extra help.
Each country is corrupt in the eyes of others. But not in the eyes of its
own citizens unless things get out of hand, as in Italy.
In France corruption operates within the systems of patronage worked by
political parties. There is also a nice blurring of the frontiers of the
public and private sectors that can enable individuals to cross the line
profitably. If the state-owned Electricite de France places huge orders with
(private) French suppliers the day before rules on the European single
market come into force, is that wrong? Certainly not.
Softening the rules of the market is a doctrine that has been espoused by
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister.
In Germany things are different again. There, the federal system ensures
power is so decentralised it is difficult to get together the critical mass
necessary for large-scale corruption. It occurs in the most dreary
circumstances: the papers are full of tales of top people paying off members
of the lower classes with public funds for minor services.
In the Netherlands corruption cannot really be confronted at a high level
because it may damage the financial interests of the state.
Spanish corruption arises from an unfamiliarity with the rules of the modern
state: the regulations are in place but are hard to understand, let alone
implement, in a land that entered the twentieth century only a few years
ago. Greece remains Balkan in its attitude towards regulation.
British corruption, in the eyes of others, arises from its twin virtues of
tradition and the old boy network. There was also something shocking in the
way John Major became prime minister after the resignation of Margaret
Thatcher, as she then was.
He was chosen, not by the people, but by 300 Tory members of parliament who
gave him a job whose powers are scarcely matched in any other democracy. The
fact that a British government can do more or less as it likes is seen as
alarming.
Some allege it is now laying the foundations of the corrupt state of the
future. The proliferation of quangos and the curious Self-Financing
Regulatory Agencies, which support themselves through raising money for
services that others are compelled to purchase, are an Aladdin's cave for
those less scrupulous than the fine people who staff such organisations at
present.
The writer Christopher Booker, an expert on these matters, believes things
are going wrong already. As does the Public Accounts Committee of parliament
which issued a disturbing report on the matter a couple of weeks ago.
So Mr Portillo's views on corruption abroad have been greeted in part as
entertainment, in part as a curious element in the British psyche. But not
as a contribution to a comparative study of the pathology of improbity.
In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, under the headline 'Where you can't
buy the examiners,' the paper's London correspondent wrote: 'Attacks on 'the
foreigners' had already become the recipe for success at the last
Conservative party conference.'
He noted that now there were stricter laws introduced by one beneficiary of
that mood, Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. He has imposed new
rules against 'treacherous foreigners who come from the European Union to
Britain to swindle the social services'.
Le Monde compared the Portillo outburst to that of Edith Cresson, the
one-time French prime minister, who spoke of the depraved sexual morals of
Anglo-Saxons. It concluded: 'There should exist in each European government
a minister responsible for insults and imprecations. Like their colleagues,
they should meet regularly to harmonise abuse at the very heart of the
Union. There exists near Brussels a convenient location for their
conferences: the Chateau de Moulinsart, property of Captain Haddock.'
Captain Haddock, for the uninitiated, is the drunken oaf who accompanies the
boy detective Tintin on his adventures. In England he lives at Marlinspike
Hall: each country has a home for Captain Haddock. And, nearly everywhere,
he has an English name . . .

FT  12 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Confused over my liability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I was born on February 22 1919 and my wife on July 1 1915. My income is such
that my tax liability falls well within the 20p in the pound bracket. It
appears to me that, for 1994/95, I will be entitled to the married couple's
allowance of Pounds 2,505 and the personal allowance of Pounds 4,370.
It was stated in the Budget, however, that these allowances would be
'limited to 20 per cent.' I do not fully understand this. Does it mean that,
as I pay no tax above the 20p in the pound rate, the restriction has no
practical effect in my case? How is the restriction to 20 per cent in the
allowances brought into any calculation of my tax liability?
The 20 per cent restriction applies only to your married couple's allowance,
which will be Pounds 2,705. In your case, the restriction will have no
practical effect.
According to Budget resolution 15, your tax bill will be calculated
initially without taking the married couple's allowance into account; the
resulting tax charge will then be reduced by 20 per cent of Pounds 2,705.
You might like to ask your MP to urge the chancellor to rationalise the tax
rules for people over 64 so that senior citizens no longer face more complex
calculations than MPs (few of whom are over 64).

FT  12 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Assessing the age allowance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am 65 and trying to assess whether I will be eligible for age allowance in
the 1994/95 tax year. I know what gross income from my pension and
investments is likely to be in 1994/95 and I pay private medical insurance
subscriptions, from which tax is deducted at 25 per cent.
1. When the tax office makes an assessment for age allowance eligibility,
will it make a gross private medical insurance deduction from total gross
income or will it be a net deduction?
2. I received some investment income gross in the 1992/93 and 1993/94 tax
years, and the account was closed in January this year. When I pay the tax
on this investment income in the 1994/95 tax year, will the increase to my
total gross income apply to the previous year or will the gross investment
income for 92/93 and 93/94 become a part of my total gross income for 94/95?
1. The answer is neither. Under paragraph 2 of schedule 10 to the Finance
Bill, medical insurance premiums will no longer be deductible after 1993-94
in calculating someone's total income for age relief. You might like to
write to the Inland Revenue, Public Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand,
London, WC2R 1LB, for a (free) copy of the Budget day press release IR7 (Tax
relief for private medical insurance).
2. The investment income received gross in 1992-93 and 1993-94 forms part of
your total income of the years in which it was received, namely 1992-93 and
1993-94.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Will you please tell me what is the current upper limit for exemption from
CGT on the sale of a chattel with a life of more than 50 years?
Does the exemption figure apply to the sale price at auction, or the net
figure received after auctioneer charges such as commission, insurance etc?
Section 262(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'Subject
to this section, a gain accruing on a disposal of an asset which is tangible
movable property shall not be a chargeable gain if the amount or value of
the consideration for the disposal does not exceed Pounds 6,000.'
So, the answer is that the limit is a sale price of Pounds 6,000 (not net
proceeds of Pounds 6,000).
Ask your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet to capital gains tax,
CGT14.

Will I be contravening the tax regulations in so doing? What is the position
regarding interest earned on such accounts?
If the money which you contribute to the joint account does no more than
meet your half share of the living expenses, then there is no problem. On
the other hand, if your husband's contributions to the joint account are
insufficient to meet his half share of the expenses, then the tax position
depends upon whether, when he gave you the money, there was an understanding
it might be used to subsidise him after he retired.
Ask your tax office for the (free) Inland Revenue booklet IR83 (Independent
taxation: a guide for tax practitioners), and study paragraph 19 for further
guidance.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Keep track of your trips home -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN

<TEXT>
Every expatriate knows that the length and frequency of visits to Britain
can affect residence status and, as a result, exposure to UK tax. Often,
though, the certainty ends there. Few can pick their way unerringly through
the complications of the 'six months' rule,' the 'three months' average
rule' and the '62-day rule'.
The problems start as soon as you leave the UK. For tax purposes, you can be
treated as not resident and not ordinarily resident from the day after your
departure, whether for employment or emigration. If for employment, both
your absence and the job must extend beyond a complete tax year (until April
6 1995, at least, if you were leaving now). If for emigration, you need to
produce evidence of having left permanently  - say, by acquiring a permanent
home in your new country of residence.
Most importantly though, a ruling that you are non-resident depends on
subsequent visits to the UK not exceeding either 182 days in a tax year, or
90 days a year on average.
A great deal can hang on this because, if you are resident and ordinarily
resident in the UK, you can be taxed on world-wide income and gains. But not
resident/not ordinarily resident status limits your exposure to UK source
income (even some of that escapes the charge), while only capital gains
derived from selling assets used in a British business remain taxable.
Even when non-resident status is achieved, you cannot afford to relax.
Visits to the UK totalling more than 182 days in a tax year will make you
resident for that year. Visits exceeding 90 days a year, on a rolling
four-yearly average, will make you ordinarily resident from the fifth year -
indeed, they will make you ordinarily resident from the start if you plan to
make them. And, once you are ordinarily resident, a visit of just one day
will make you resident for the year.
In practice, full-time workers are unlikely to be able to exceed these
limits in any event, but they must be kept in mind by retired emigrants,
non-working spouses and those between jobs.
For them, though, keeping non-resident status has been made easier by the
abolition from 1993/94 of the 'available accommodation' rule which meant you
were treated as resident in any year you visited the UK if you maintained
accommodation there for your use. But this did not apply if you were
employed full-time overseas or had a business abroad.
(These rules are concerned only with visits to England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland and the three-mile territorial limit surrounding them. If
you are on an oil platform or other installation within that limit, you are
treated as being in the UK. But this is not the case with installations in
'designated areas' of the continental shelf outside the limit, even though
your salary will be deemed to arise in the UK.)
The manner in which visits should be counted was determined by a 1951 case
(Wilkie v. CIR) which concluded that total elapsed time - not just days but
hours, too - must be taken into account. But since this would have caused
the Inland Revenue big administrative problems, it adopted a standard
procedure which ignores days of arrival and departure - subject, of course,
to your right to insist on the strict legal treatment if that works to your
advantage.
Applying the standard procedure has the strange effect that, if you arrive
in the UK one day and depart the next, you are treated as not having been
there at all. Some other periods spent in the UK also can be ignored. After
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the Revenue announced in March 1991 that
periods spent in Britain because of exceptional circumstances beyond an
individual's control - such as illness - could be ignored, but only for the
purpose of the 90-day average calculation.
It is not only non-residents who need to count their visits. So also must
short-term overseas employees who do not become non-resident. Their salaries
are excluded from UK tax liability if their work is carried out in the
course of a qualifying period exceeding 365 days, regardless of whether that
involves a complete tax year.
For this purpose, 'qualifying period' covers days spent outside the UK,
together with intervening days spent in Britain provided that these do not
exceed either 62 consecutive days or one-sixth of the days in the period.
(For seafarers, these limits are extended to 183 consecutive days, or
one-half of the days in the period, respectively).
In this case, the legislation sidesteps the problems of Wilkie v. CIR. The
question of whether you are regarded as present in the UK for a day is
determined by where you are at the end of it. Even though there is no chance
of your carriage turning into a pumpkin, there could be times when you are
just as anxious as Cinderella to leave by midnight.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Performance, the only way to judge a
trust's real worth - Classifications are no guide as to how a fund will
perform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CUTHBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The malaise afflicting classifications for unit trusts can be demonstrated
by looking at the UK growth sector. While many of its 114 funds with
five-year track records have much in common, a lot of others differ so much
that there seems no reason to lump them all together.
One way to address this problem is to split the sector into two parts - one
having non-specialist funds, sometimes biased towards FT-SE stocks, that aim
for no-frills growth; the other with funds pursuing growth with a twist, in
other words, specialisation. We will look at these funds now and the
non-specialist ones next week.
Many specialist funds can be identified immediately by their names: special
situations, recovery, ethical and enterprise are the most obvious. The
distinctive nature of at least three of these translates into a unique
five-year risk/return signature. Take the 18 special situations funds with
five-year histories: they have been 26 per cent riskier than the sector
average (risk here is represented by unit price volatility), and returns
have been 30 per cent less.
Recovery funds (12 of which have five-year records) have been marginally
less risky (20 per cent greater than the average) and marginally less
disappointing (a 24 per cent underperformance of the sector's average
return). The five-year-old ethical funds (there are four of them) are the
least risky of all the growth types, specialist and non-specialist, with
risk 6 per cent less than the average and an average total return that
matches the sector's average return, too. The enterprise funds, of which
there are two, are classified as specialist because of their pursuit of
aggressive growth plus strategies of the special situations type.
The important point is that the special situation and recovery classes are
not growth funds. Growth is a definable characteristic which is
distinguished not by the fund's aim but by its style. Specifically, growth
funds are those which pursue stocks with earnings growth rates higher than
the market average; therefore, they will generally have an average
price/earnings multiple higher than the market as well.
Yet, I could not find any recovery or special situation funds with both
these characteristics. Indeed, most recovery funds have virtually no
exposure to growth stocks, and that is how it should be. Recovery is a
highly cyclical theme which has virtually nothing to do with growth, whereas
special situation funds tend to mix virtually every style possible.
In the absence of proper classification, performance assessment is the thing
to watch. We have applied two performance standards so as to cull the many
into the few. The first is a simple test of whether a fund has beaten the
FT-SE A All-Share index on a total return basis; but because cumulative
return distorts performance, the returns used here are the sum of
period-to-period returns.
Managers could, of course, beat the market simply by taking riskier bets, so
our second benchmark adjusts the returns of the All-Share for its risk. The
same method has been applied to the 39 specialist funds I have surveyed in
this sector. The resulting number for the All-Share is 0.29. Any funds that
have been able to beat this, as well as the discrete total return for the
All-Share (85.28), have been included in our main table.
These standards constitute a tough test of ability to manage risk as well as
return. Unfortunately,specialist funds do not fare well.
PC Technical Analysis passes with a high risk/return rating (0.33) but fails
with a lower than necessary total return, albeit one which is fourth out of
39. Much worse, no special situations fund betters either test (although
Capability Special Situations just misses out), and only one of 12 recovery
funds (Legal &amp; General's) is up to scratch.
This result is perhaps understandable for recovery funds because their
five-year records always will be hit hard by their cyclical sensitivity
(although the strategic common sense of L&amp;G's Leslie Hooper - who bought
high-quality stocks in bombed-out sectors rather than bombed-out stocks
directly, and then switched into true recovery stocks when economic recovery
was in sight - suggests that recovery management can be more than just a
cyclical play).
The non-representation from the 18 special situations funds, however, is a
damning sign. There is no overwhelming reason, aside from the consistent
bias towards small company stocks, why this type of fund should be dominated
by cyclical trends.
This wholesale failure might call the special situations concept into
question except for one thing: the problem is not absence of potential but a
scarcity of asset-allocation ability.
The one specialist fund to make the grade, Schroder UK Enterprise, has a
matchless record of total returns (its BM ratio of 1.31 is huge) and
consistency (it has beaten the All-Share in all five years).
For that matter, only two funds in the whole sector - Pembroke and Gartmore
British Growth - have been able to give it a run for its money.
Schroder's strength is that it has no particular specialisation; indeed it
has had a mix of value, growth and stocks with small capitalisation over the
past five years. The fund also has had a policy of boosting its returns by
concentrating its portfolio in 25 stocks, which often means taking a 5-6 per
cent bet on a particular company.
This is a risky strategy - the fund's risk relative to its sector (obtained
by dividing its price volatility number, the standard deviation, by the same
for the sector average) is 1.08, or 8 per cent above the average. Yet, it
has paid off. The high risk/return score of 0.37 not only says that the
fund's total risk has been well-rewarded - its size also is a sure sign of
ability at work.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Maverick that made good - Debbie
Harrison charts National Mutual's progress from the days when Keynes was
boss / Insurance for Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Mutual's reputation as an investment maverick goes back a long way.
The chairman from 1921-38 was John Maynard Keynes, the man who helped shape
post-second world war economic policy. He took National Mutual into equities
at a time when the sector was shunned by most life offices.
More recently, the company re-shaped its core business structure, moving in
the mid-1980s from endowment policies - which it felt were unsuitable to
repay mortgages - and into pensions. Once this decision was made, the
transition period was almost indecently quick. During the October 1987 stock
market upheaval, National Mutual pulled out of the mortgage market overnight
and has never looked back.
The company's investment aim is to be in the top quartile (top 25 per cent)
of returns on a rolling three-year basis when compared with similar funds.
Its unit-linked personal pension funds have achieved this target easily
(with the exception of the index-linked fund), while the managed fund was
one of only five recommended by actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow in its annual
surveys of the market in 1993 and 1992*. But returns on the managed and UK
equities funds tailed off in 1993, partly because the investment team did
not take part in the boom in smaller company shares.
Apart from performance, one of the most important features for which to look
in a financial product is the level and flexibility of charges. Although
abandoned in 1989, the Maximum Commission Agreement (MCA) is still used as a
benchmark by life offices. It was devised by the Life Assurance and Unit
Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) to impose a ceiling on the level of
commission life offices could pay an independent adviser.
National Mutual's maximum payment - 133 per cent of the MCA - is the
industry average. Commission paid depends on the term of the policy. On a
20-year monthly-premium personal pension plan, for instance, the MCA
up-front commission rate would have been just under 45 per cent of the first
year's premiums. At 133 per cent, the commission would be about 59.5 per
cent of the first year's premiums.
National Mutual's annual investment management charge is low at 0.36 per
cent, compared with 0.5-1 per cent charged by most competitors. Elsewhere,
its charging structure is relatively clear compared with rival products.
Where you opt to pay fees to an independent adviser, so that the cost of
commission is removed from your policy, there are no early termination
penalties.
If commission is paid on the unit-linked policy, this is recouped from the
early premiums which are allocated to initial units. Premiums continue to
buy these lower-value units for the first 12 months. If the policy is
cancelled during this period, there will be a penalty.
The with-profits personal pension does carry a market value adjuster - a
discretionary penalty on withdrawing funds during, say, a stock market
crash. To date, however, the company has not used this mechanism.
National Mutual's expense ratio, at 22.64 per cent in 1992, is higher than
the industry average (19.3 per cent in 1991), but Gavin Hill, managing
director, says this does not reflect the true impact of its charges.
The most widely used indicator is the 'reduction in yield' figure, which
shows the equivalent annual percentage charge over the life of a contract.
On the society's 25-year, unit-linked personal pension, the RIY was 1.3 per
cent in 1993. This is below the industry average of 1.6 per cent, according
to the Financial Times Personal Pensions 1994 handbook.
The worst scandal to hit the personal pensions sector since the product was
launched in 1988 has been the widespread mis-selling of transfer plans to
employees with company pensions. But National Mutual has a strict policy on
transfer business. Hill says: 'A transfer value analysis must accompany all
transfer applications. If the analysis does not support the transfer, the
case will not be accepted unless some other justification can be produced.'
The society sells exclusively through independent advisers but Hill warns
that people must check an IFA's credentials thoroughly before accepting
advice. 'If you are seeking advice from an independent adviser, make sure
that person or firm has proven expertise on the pensions market,' he says.
Hill is neutral in the debate over fees versus commissions. 'Advice has to
be paid for. The most important point is that the consumer should come to a
clear agreement with the adviser on the level of remuneration. It is then a
matter of choice whether this is paid-for by fees or by a commission.
'Moreover, it is no good comparing projected returns on commission-based
products with nil-commission plans. The comparison is only fair if the cost
of the fees is compounded over the term of the contract and added in to the
final total.'
Continuity of investment staff at National Mutual is good. So is the
society's 'persistency ratio' of 94.7 per cent; this indicates the number of
policies that continue to maturity rather than being terminated early.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, awards NM an 'average'
financial strength assessment. This denotes 'adequate financial strength'
but cautions that 'this strength may be affected by adverse economic or
underwriting conditions'.
National Mutual has won several industry awards for service and
administration.

                                  unit-linked plan - we asked for
                                  illustrations, using its own charges
                                  rather than the Lautro standard
                                  basis, for a man aged 45 who expects
                                  to retire at 65 (ie, a 20-year
                                  contract) paying (a) pounds 200 per
                                  month and (b) a stand-alone single
                                  premium of pounds 10,000.
                                  Illustrations using Lautro's standard
                                  charges - which, in fact, are much
                                  lower than the industry average -
                                  are shown in brackets. The growth
                                  assumptions are Lautro's standard 6
                                  per cent and 12 per cent.

Where full commission is paid, National Mutual's charges are higher than
the Lautro basis, yielding a lower projected return. Where the
commission is stripped out, the reverse is true. But if you arrange
nil-commission terms, you must add in the cost of your adviser's fees
compounded over the term of the contract.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pru takes a new line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An early sign of the sort of product innovation that is likely to be a
feature of the life assurance sector over the coming months because of
commission disclosure has been given by the Prudential, the UK's largest
life insurer.
Prudential will launch a single recurring premium pension - called Premium
Option - in March, aimed at the company's sales through independent
financial advisers.
The new product will offer advisers several ways to choose how they take
their commission (from 0 per cent to 5.2 per cent of each contribution each
year, and up to 20 per cent up-front as a lump sum payment in respect of the
first five years' commission). It is also intended to improve early
surrender values for customers.
The proposals from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, to ensure that sales agents tell customers how much they will be
paid in commission for selling a particular product, are due to come into
effect from the start of July. There will be a six-month transitional period
before every company and adviser must comply with the requirement.
Several life companies are planning new product ranges with differing
structures so that customers and IFAs can choose from a variety of
commission arrangements once the disclosure provisions come into effect.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A question of class - Paying for
private schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Social barriers to independent education are falling but finance is still a
formidable obstacle for many parents, according to a survey published this
week for the Independent Schools Information Service. It suggested that the
hereditary class system said to dominate public schools had loosened
greatly: more than half the pupils in private school now came from homes
where both parents were state-educated.
That, however, appeared more to reflect the distribution of wealth in modern
Britain rather than any new open-door policy, the report indicated. School
fee inflation has run ahead of retail price inflation consistently for the
past decade.
The Isis figures - produced by the polling organisation Mori - showed that,
since 1989, the proportion of private school pupils from families in social
class A rose from 15 to 22 per cent, while representation from the lower
classes C, D, and E dropped from 37 to 30 per cent.
Rising school fees seemed to be the main cause. Last year, average day
school fees rose by 8.5 per cent following increases of 12.7 per cent in
1992 and 12.5 per cent in 1991, taking average term fees over that period
from Pounds 995 to Pounds 1,368.
Parents increasingly are realising they need to plan for this; the Isis
survey showed that the proportion making advance plans to pay fees increased
from 25 per cent to 35 per cent over the same period. This will have helped
the financial services industry, which has used fee plans to sell life
assurance endowment policies. But most parents (82 per cent) pay the fees
using only their salary and other personal income.
Unless more parents plan in advance, independent schools are likely to
remain exclusive. The schools themselves now seem to realise this. The
draw-down loan scheme run for Isis by Claremont Savile, the independent
adviser, has been revised several times in the past few years and now offers
parents loans from two different companies: Citibank Mortgage, the
centralised lender which joined this week, and the Halifax. This scheme will
be most attractive to those with a house worth significantly more than the
outstanding mortgage and who have not built up savings plans in advance.
Citibank offers a variable rate of 7.3 per cent, capped until the year 2000,
at 9.99 per cent. It includes two years' free unemployment cover and allows
monthly over-payments for those who can afford them and wish to protect
their equity. The company will lend up to a level where 85 per cent of a
property's value is mortgaged.
Repaying the mortgage, even with interest rates at their present low levels
by historic standards, often makes sense as it is difficult to get a return
of 7.3 per cent on alternative investments. Citibank allows repayments in
arrears and, as with the existing Halifax scheme, allows borrowers to draw
down funds up to four times each year, when fees become payable. The
arrangement fee is Pounds 195, with a minimum advance of Pounds 10,000 and a
maximum of Pounds 150,000.
Perhaps the most attractive feature is that borrowers may repay their loan
using any savings vehicle. They are not restricted to endowment policies,
which Claremont Savile does not recommend because they are tax-inefficient
and inflexible. Instead, it steers parents towards free-standing additional
voluntary contributions - if they have spare pension capacity - or personal
equity plans. It should be noted, however, that Claremont Savile takes
commission from any investments which it buys for clients.
It is always better to avoid problems once your child is ready to go to
school by saving in advance. Collective equity schemes, such as investment
trust savings schemes, should allow strong growth over a long period. If,
eventually, you send your child to a state school, you can always spend the
money on something else.
Apart from greater planning of finances, more parents are shopping around
for schools. They visit more of them and apply for more prospectuses than
when the last similar survey was carried out in 1989; and 15 per cent
identify exam result 'league tables' - now published by the government and
compiled separately by several newspapers, including the Financial Times -
as a factor.
State schools, which generally had a bad press last year, should not be
ruled out, however; finding a good state school could save you thousands of
pounds. But the best news for parents who do not trust the state sector
could be that competitive pressures are forcing independent schools to keep
the lid on their costs and fees.
Isis believes the average rise in fees for this academic year, compared with
last, is between 3.5 and 5.0 per cent: still above the inflation rate but
representing a much lower real increase than in previous years. Bursars also
seem confident that further cuts can be made next year.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: All the facts you can take - Kevin
Goldstein-Jackson samples two screen-based information services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am an information junkie. I read three daily newspapers, five Sunday
papers, and subscribe to 48 magazines and three newsletters.
Unfortunately, I tend to remember only the more unusual items - such as the
claim that elephant trunk, if cooked for 16 hours, tastes rather like roast
beef. Or that licking a cane toad can cause hallucinations due to the
bufotenine toxin it contains.
I still remember the sad report in 1976 of the Japanese businessman who was
killed on a golf course when lightning struck the metal zip on his trousers.
I have favoured plastic buttons ever since.
In an average year, I look at more than 300 company reports to shareholders.
Did you know that the McVitie's factory in Manchester can produce 3m Jaffa
cakes a day for United Biscuits? Or that it takes cleaners a month to wash
all 3,678 windows of the Transamerica pyramid in San Francisco?
The problem with looking at millions of facts and figures is that you can
get an information overload. It can be difficult to recall what is useful
rather than merely interesting.
It was, therefore, with some trepidation that I accepted an offer recently
to try out two more sources of information: Market-Eye* and Financial
Alert**.
I already use the telextext services displaying share prices and financial
news on BBC-2 and Channel 4, but Market-Eye promised much more. It displays
real-time share price information direct from the London Stock Exchange.
Last month, it added an 'up to the minute news service'.
I was concerned that I might be tempted to sit in front of the screen all
day, watching the 'moving price ticker' or the 'high' and 'low' prices for
more than 3,000 equities. I feared I might turn into a gambler, trying to
beat the professionals by using the screen information to buy and sell very
rapidly in an attempt to make quick profits.
So, Market-Eye was installed in a bedroom next to my study. That way, I
thought, I would be less likely to become addicted to the screen.
I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the system. Market-Eye
simply plugs into an ordinary television aerial socket, so there are no
expensive connection costs. The keypad is designed very well for adult
fingers and it is possible to sort through hundreds of pages filled with
real-time data including foreign exchange details, SEAQ International,
'shares on the move,' gilts - even a list of suspended equities, with the
dates of their suspension. The news service includes corporate results and a
variety of company announcements.
Rather than wasting hours, I find Market-Eye is actually saving me time. By
pushing a few buttons, my portfolio is displayed on the screen with the
latest information. It is also possible to download certain information onto
a personal computer.
The only drawback is the cost. Buying Market-Eye - comprising monitor,
receiver and keypad - costs Pounds 1,521.63 (inc VAT). To this must be added
an annual subscription charge (including maintenance) of Pounds 1,051.63.
Financial Alert is especially helpful for people who travel a lot and do not
have easy access to a teletext service. It is a portable, hand-held machine
rather like a large pocket calculator which works on rechargeable batteries.
Using the keys, a small, built-in screen can display company prices for the
FT-100 as well as around 800 other British listings. There is also a news
service, although the size of the screen restricts the amount that can be
provided.
Financial Alert costs Pounds 199.50, plus a 'one-time connection charge' of
Pounds 75. Various monthly charges apply, depending on the services used,
but there is a minimum monthly fee of Pounds 82.50.
Mind you, despite these technological wonders, I still maintain my craving
for printed facts. The Transamerica report to shareholders reveals that the
average American consumes 25lb of bananas, 24lb of lettuce, 19lb of apples
and 3lb of pears each year.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of almost 8.5m shares in Berisford International at 120p by the
Chicago-based Pritzker family looks curious, given that they were trading at
almost double that a short time later. The Pritzkers apparently were keen to
crystalise a capital loss to offset huge gains on other investments.
Rodney Olsen, finance director of Cable &amp; Wireless, the international
telecommunications group, has sold 60,000 shares at 533p. C&amp;W's share price
has been under some pressure since, partly due to an anticipated fall in
revenue from ending higher-rate morning calls.
Sir Ernest Harrison has been raising cash on a large scale. He sold 100,000
shares at 400p in Chubb Securities and 75,000 Vodafone shares at 577p. Both
companies were part of the Racal empire before they were de-merged and Sir
Ernest remains chairman of both.
Shares of GWR Group, the radio company have outperformed the market by more
than 120 per cent in the past year and Lord Stokes, a non-executive
director, has sold 25,000 at 931p, a significant reduction in his holding.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Funds with a Latin flavour - Bethan
Hutton surveys new issues and finds Latin America is flavour of the month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Latin America seems to be investment trust flavour of the month. Edinburgh
Fund Managers, Morgan Grenfell and Templeton are launching London-listed
trusts specialising in the area, while Gartmore has a Dublin-listed trust
aimed mostly at institutional investors.
As emerging markets in the Pacific rim have had such a good run, a growing
number of international investors are switching their attention to Latin
America.
Economic reforms, and the passing of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, have added to the attractions of the area. And although British
investors have been less active in the region so far than their US
counterparts, that is showing signs of changing.
EFM is calling its fund the Inca trust, and hopes to raise between Pounds
75m and Pounds 100m. It will invest in a mix of small, medium and large
companies in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia and Peru.
EFM already manages a unit trust, the Edinburgh Latin American fund, which
has a similar investment brief and is the third-best performer (of 150) in
the international equity growth sector over the year to February 1 (source:
Micropal). The public offer period for Inca is due to open in mid-March for
two weeks. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and warrants will be attached
on a one-for-five basis.
Morgan Grenfell's Latin American investment trust aims to raise more than
Pounds 100m, with a placing and public offer which opens in March. Full
details have not been announced yet. Templeton has just announced its plans
for a trust, which will be on offer to the public in April.
Foreign &amp; Colonial, manager of the oldest and largest UK investment trust of
the same name, is to set up a fund concentrating on its own backyard for the
first time in its 125-year history.
To date, all Foreign &amp; Colonial trusts have had a substantial overseas
element. Now, though, F&amp;C is launching a purely UK fund, the Income Growth
investment trust. This will be aimed largely at personal equity plan
investors.
It will invest in companies selected from the FT-SE 350 index, with the aim
of producing long-term income growth above the rate of inflation and capital
growth greater than the index.
The yield is expected to be in line with the index, now about 3.3 per cent,
and dividends will be paid quarterly.
One warrant will be attached to every five shares in units of 500p, and the
shares and warrants will be traded as a package for the first 43 days so
that the warrants also can be transferred into a Pep.
The public offer is open from March 1 to 22 and minimum investment is Pounds
2,000. Initial expenses will be capped at 4 per cent. There will be no
initial charge for Pep investors who buy during the subscription period, but
there is an annual management charge of up to 1 per cent.
There is an annual Pep charge of Pounds 60, and the normal initial Pep
charge (for those who invest after the offer for subscription has closed) is
Pounds 50.
Because of the timing of the launch, investors can transfer shares into a
Pep either side of the tax year-end; thus, they can invest up to Pounds
12,000 through a Pep but pay only one annual fee and no up-front fee. The
new fund will also be included in the F&amp;C savings scheme.
Existing trusts also are cashing in on the investment trust boom to raise
more money. Templeton Emerging Markets, the largest fund in the sector and
best performer over three years, is making an issue of conversion shares
with warrants attached. Full details are not available yet but the public
offer is likely to be during March.
Abtrust is raising new money for its New Dawn trust, which invests in the
Far East (excluding Japan). It is issuing up to Pounds 45m worth of
conversion shares, two-thirds of which have been placed with institutions
already.
The remaining Pounds 15m worth are available in a public offer for
subscription, open until March 2. Minimum subscription is Pounds 250. The
C-shares will be converted into ordinary shares as soon as the new money is
invested, and one warrant will be issued for every five new ordinary shares.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: How well is your portfolio doing? -
Barry Riley considers a test of its strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Did your professionally-managed portfolio achieve a total return before tax,
but including both income and capital growth, of 26 per cent in 1993? If so,
says Robert Brown, you can be satisfied. If not, you might want to hear the
excuses of your investment manager.
Private clients of investment managers and stockbrokers have, for too long,
been fobbed off with inadequate information about how well their investments
have performed, says Brown, who is deputy managing director of Cantrade
Investment Management.
To fill the information vacuum, he has devised the Cantrade Calculator: a
three-part test of portfolio performance. In effect, he is proposing what
professional investors - such as those who run company pension funds - call
a benchmark, a measure of reasonable performance.
There are both good and bad reasons why private client portfolio managers
have been so coy. They will probably argue that their clients have such
diverse requirements that any comparisons would be unfair and misleading.
After all, the clients may range from aggressive gamblers to the fabled
widows and orphans, with all shades of temperament and financial
circumstances in between. Comparisons of individual portfolio figures with
averages or benchmarks could create discontent if some clients have done
worse than others in a particular period.
It is widely suspected, however, that investment managers are inhibited
mainly by their wish to cover up poor and fluctuating performance. In the
ultra-competitive world of company pension fund management, where the
figures are widely available, there has been a ruthless concentration of
business in the hands of a relatively few successful managers. Dozens of
others have lost out. In private client management, the sleepier firms do
not want the same competitive climate to develop.
Cantrade is a London offshoot of Union Bank of Switzerland, and emerged from
the private client side of stockbroker Phillips &amp; Drew. It manages about
Pounds 800m for private clients and charities and provides them with a
comprehensive quarterly report, much on the lines of those which
institutional managers give to pension funds.
He has, therefore, developed a three-part test:
Compare the results against the risk-free alternative of simply leaving all
of the money on short-term deposit. There is no point in taking the
additional risks associated with stock market investment unless there is a
superior return. Compare the portfolio's total return with the rate of
inflation. Is its value being preserved in real terms?
Look at performance against the market. Cantrade says UK performance should
be measured against the FT-SE-A All-Share index; overseas assets against the
FT-Actuaries World index (in sterling); and defensive assets against the
FT-Actuaries Over 5 Years Index-Linked gilts index.
The first two yardsticks were scarcely very demanding in 1993 when inflation
and interest rates were so low and market returns so high, but they might be
more testing in other circumstances.
A key aspect of the Cantrade Calculator is the benchmark provided by the
model portfolio. This holds 50 per cent in UK equities, 20 per cent in
overseas equities, and 30 per cent in defensive assets. The latter may
include fixed-interest gilts and overseas bonds, together with cash, but
Cantrade regards index-linked gilts as the 'definitive' defensive asset
category.
On the basis of the underlying index figures, the benchmark returned 8 per
cent during the final quarter of 1993 and 26 per cent for the year as a
whole. Brown claims this is a fair measure of how a typical private client
portfolio should have performed before tax and costs, including management
charges. 'Capital gains tax means that active strategic switching is not
economic,' he says. 'This underlines the importance of a balanced core
strategy.'
Calculations made on the basis of historical figures show that the model
portfolio would have returned 18 per cent a year on average in nominal terms
over the past two decades, or about 9 per cent in real terms. The Cantrade
Calculator will be updated quarterly and published for private investors
holding diversified portfolios.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Send for the doctors - Independent
adviser Hill Martin. Third of a series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Smith has no hesitation in identifying what he thinks sets Hill Martin
apart from the pack of independent financial advisers: 'We are managed from
the front by Mark Ormerod and Nicholas Mercer, the two founders of the firm;
there are no fat cats here trying to cream it off. And we are completely
client-orientated.
'Financial diagnosis is very like medical diagnosis. The good doctor will
diagnose the trouble only when he has thoroughly examined the patient, and
we take the view that we cannot help clients until we know them.'
Smith, the regional director, joined Bristol-based Hill Martin in 1990,
having previously been technical director of Sedgwick Personal Financial
Management and divisional director of personal financial planning at
accountant Ernst &amp; Young. He admits he had 'a terrible crisis' in joining a
smaller firm. 'I sorted out this out by going in and looking at the files.
Mark Ormerod just said 'help yourself.' By the end of half an hour, I was
satisfied.'
Clients who may be worried about putting their investments with any but
household names do not have the same opportunity to scrutinise the books,
and Smith sympathises with their fears. 'If you are NM Rothschild, no one
asks a question about it. If you are Hill Martin, they do, and I don't blame
them. That is where the Levitts of this world have got us.
'I had one client with Pounds 165,000 who was hesitating. At last, she said:
'I see; I just have to trust you.' I said 'Yes, you do, and you can'.'
While Hill Martin's head office remains in its original rabbit warren of
rooms in Bristol's financial heart, the firm has shifted course somewhat
over the years, not least in its whole-hearted adoption of a fee-paying
structure. Initially, some clients paid commissions; today, all new clients
are charged on a time/cost basis.
Fees are agreed after the first meeting with clients. Smith explains: 'We
write and quote a fee and then say whether commission offset might be
applicable. On medium to small cases, we always take commission and offset
it, because of the VAT position. On big cases, we prefer benefit enhancement
to see if we can reduce the costs of the product to the client.' VAT is
payable on fees but not on commission.
Client fees average Pounds 750 to Pounds 1,500, although those for more
substantial cases are likely to be in the Pounds 2,000-3,000 bracket.
Clients usually are sent a questionnaire before the initial meeting,
although Hill Martin is selective about who gets this quite detailed form -
which closes with the question: 'At what age would you like to
retire/achieve financial independence?'
Once a client's financial situation has been analysed, and the Hill Martin
recommendations put forward, there is a further meeting before the advice is
implemented.
There are four linked operations: financial strategy planning; investment
management; pensions; and residential and commercial finance. The aim is to
offer a one-stop service.
Clients' affairs are reviewed regularly and they receive market commentaries
and bulletins during the year. Smith says: 'What we are interested in is
long-term relationships with clients. If they don't want that, they
shouldn't come here.'
Smith expects that future growth will come from expanding the firm's
investment management, financial planning and pensions departments. Indeed,
investment management has been boosted already by the arrival of Michael
Rose, formerly investment director at ANZ Grindlays Private Bank; he joined
Graeme Farquharson, the investment director, in 1992. Farquharson himself
has managed portfolios for Hill Martin since 1983.
Smith says: 'On portfolios of up to Pounds 50,000, we put clients into unit
trusts. On sums over Pounds 100,000, they are all in Savile Row suits.' The
Savile Row brigade receive four valuations a year; off-the-peg investors get
two. The annual investment management fee is 1 per cent.
Since September 1992, Hill Martin has compiled portfolio performance
statistics - historic yardsticks that should be increasingly useful as
standards of comparison for prospective clients. Strangely, however, they
seldom ask to see these figures, which illustrate the performance that has
been achieved for others.
At the end of last year, Hill Martin's standard growth portfolio was showing
a compound annual return of 29.92 per cent since launch; the balanced
portfolio an annualised return of 28.34 per cent; and the income portfolio
one of 20.77 per cent. 'The portfolios are designed to go with other
products like zero preference shares, gilts and National Savings that don't
require active management,' says Smith.
Like all investment managers, he has had mixed fortunes. 'I was looking for
a low-risk investment for our clients recently and, at launch, I picked on
Exeter Zero Preference fund. It was 25p with a 2p discount. It has had
something like a 65 per cent capital appreciation. I have a client with
Pounds 50,000 in it, and it has paid for his past two Christmases. We drew
Pounds 5,000 in the first year and Pounds 6,000 this year.
'But I also had a client who bought Exeter High Income at 53p and, the next
time I looked at it in the valuation, it was 37p.'
Hill Martin clients typically have assets of around Pounds 500,000
(including their house) and an income of Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 50,000,
according to Smith. He adds: 'We are really only talking about a reasonably
wealthy section of the population.'

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Savers to suffer from rate cuts -
Societies keen to retain margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savers rather than mortgage-holders are more likely to feel the effects of
Tuesday's base rate cut. Institutions usually pass on a full rate reduction
to their savers but give mortgage-holders a smaller one. And while savings
rates are usually cut immediately, mortgage rate reductions are often not
implemented for existing borrowers until the next month.
Building societies appear reluctant to narrow their margins by maintaining
savings rates while passing on a cut to borrowers. They were only too happy
this week to take their cue from Halifax, the largest lender, which
dismissed the base rate reduction as 'a technical adjustment' too small 'to
cause us to re-think our mortgage or savings rates.'
Halifax's standard variable mortgage rate remains at 7.64 per cent and that
of Nationwide, the second largest society, at 7.74.
Meanwhile, three banks announced mortgage rate reductions, but at least 17
cut their savings rates. These included Barclays, Bank of Scotland,
Co-Operative bank, National Westminster and Yorkshire Bank. According to
Vicki Burn, of Moneyfacts, Yorkshire bank dropped savings rates mostly by
the full quarter point while Bank of Scotland reduced them by between
0.25-0.35 of a percentage point.
Barclays made the reductions on its one-month and 90-day notice accounts
(Capital Advantage and Select) while National Westminster cut more broadly,
with rates on the Reserve accounts all down and that on its tax-exempt
special savings account (Tessa) now down to 5.35 per cent gross instead of
5.61.
Other banks to have made reductions on some or all their savings accounts
include AIB, Aitken Hume, Bank of Ireland (GB), Caledonian, Cater Allen,
Charterhouse, Julian Hodge, Leopold Joseph, Northern, Tyndall and Ulster.
The mortgage rate reductions have come from Citibank, a centralised lender,
TSB, and Kleinwort Benson's private banking arm.
Centralised lenders are well-placed theoretically to implement cuts when
base rates come down because the cost of their borrowing is reduced. They do
not share the same mortgage-funding constraints as societies because they
can obtain funds from the money markets.
Citibank has reduced its standard variable mortgage rate to 7.4 per cent
from 7.6 for new customers and from the beginning of April for existing
borrowers.
TSB, which has been attempting to increase its share of the mortgage market,
has cut its variable rate by 0.19 of a point to 7.45 per cent. New borrowers
have to wait until March 9 to get the benefit. The bank says it has not yet
made a decision on whether to cut interest rates for savers.
Kleinwort Benson's private bank has one of the lowest variable rate
mortgages on the market, and this will be cut to 7.25 per cent from 7.49
from March 1 for both new and existing borrowers. The mortgage is packaged
into a Budget Account for long-term borrowing, which allows a draw-down
facility charged at the variable rate.
There is also a Flexible Account package with a chequebook for immediate
access to funds for short-term borrowing. Interest on the amount borrowed is
charged at 1 percentage point above the standard variable rate.
Some banks and societies argue that they do not need to react to such a
small base rate cut because there is a wide variety of mortgage discounts
and fixed rates, which are below the standard variable rate and are proving
popular with home buyers.
Mortgage broker John Charcol this week launched a variable rate mortgage of
2.75 per cent (7.7 APR), with funds provided by Britannia building society.
The rate represents a discount of 5 percentage points off the society's
variable rate and lasts until January 1 1995.
Borrowers can opt for a fixed rate in the second year or an 0.5 point
reduction in the society's variable rate.
Completion fee is Pounds 195 and the mortgage does not depend on compulsory
insurance-related products.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society has abolished its application and
valuation fees for new borrowers or those taking out a further advance with
the society. This represents a saving of Pounds 135 to Pounds 450.
The society also operates a 3 point reduction in its variable rate, now 7.64
per cent, for the first year of a new mortgage for borrowers with a minimum
deposit of 20 per cent.
The John Lewis Partnership is to cut the cost of its store cards from March
1. The annualised percentage rate on purchases will fall to 18 per cent
instead of 19.5. The last change was on October 1 1992 - and there have been
four base rate cuts, excluding this week's, since then.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: All eyes on Glaxo - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday Westminster Health Care, the nursing home group which was floated
in April, is expected to announce a sharp rise in profits at the interim
stage. For the six months to November, pre-tax profits are estimated at
Pounds 4.9m compared to Pounds 1.6m. The previous figure was stated after
interest of Pounds 2.7m, but the Pounds 64m proceeds from the float will
have cut that bill.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, reports first-quarter results to
the end of December on Tuesday. There is a wide range of forecasts because
of the many uncertainties involved. The cost of the US coal strike, which
has now ended; the severity of the negative swing on interest charges; the
contribution from Quantum Chemical, acquired at the end of the last
financial year; and the effect of exchange rates. However, hopes are for a
modest underlying rise from last time's Pounds 216m, excluding Pounds 20m of
disposal profits.
Glaxo's half-year figures on Thursday kick off the UK's pharmaceuticals
sector results season. With SmithKline Beecham the following week, and
Wellcome and Zeneca in March, analysts will be examining the sector's
fortunes in an unfamiliar light: that of the yield. Until the early 1990s,
the drugs sector was the darling of the capital growth investors. But the
threat of cost-cutting in government healthcare budgets has stopped that in
its tracks.
This means that all eyes will turn first to Glaxo's proposed interim
dividend. Forecasts range from 8p to well over 9p, compared with last year's
7p. Even a rise at the lower end of the scale would be a powerful reminder
that a yield of almost 5 per cent compares favourably with a FT-SE 100
yielding less than 3.5 per cent.
Pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 970m, against Pounds 819m, are expected to
reflect falling interest income and tighter profit margins.
Alfred McAlpine on Thursday will become the first of the larger contractors
to announce annual results, for the year to October 31. The big question is
by how much Oliver Whitehead, the new chief executive, will write down the
company's assets following the departure of Graeme Odgers.
Profits should have benefited from the recovery in the UK housing and US
construction markets and are expected to be in the region of Pounds 6m
before write-downs. This compares with pre-tax profits Pounds 3.6m the
previous year.
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, also reports annual profits for 1993 on
Thursday. Analysts are expecting a near doubling of profits to around Pounds
90m before a Pounds 10m profit on the sale of Sharps Pixley, the bullion
business sold to Deutsche Bank for Pounds 17.6m.
Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, is expected on Thursday to announce a
strong increase in full-year profits to between Pounds 17m and Pounds 19m,
more than double last year's pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 7.8m. Analysts
are keen to hear whether Wickes is benefiting from the upturn in the housing
market, but are concerned about the impact of the recession on its
operations in continental Europe.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Global markets and the investor,
where next? - In the wake of the Fed's interest rate increase, which caused
stocks to plunge, Michael Morgan and John Pitt find strategists split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High-riding investors could be forgiven for feeling giddy when stocks on
Wall Street fell almost 100 points at the end of last week, their biggest
drop since November 1991.
The cause was the decision by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, to raise interest rates.
And although the increase was only fractional, it was enough to unsettle
Asian and European equity markets thoroughly from the beginning of this
week, giving professional and private investors plenty of cause to
reconsider their positions.
Even before the Federal Reserve's move, global equity market strategists
agreed that higher US rates were imminent. But their views differ sharply on
how investors should respond.
On the one hand, Albert Edwards, of Kleinwort Benson, believes the markets
are decidedly 'iffy'. He says investors should hold cash, the idea being to
bank some of their recent profits so that they can rebuild their holdings
when prices turn lower.
On the other, Sushil Wadhwani, of Goldman Sachs, issued a strategy note
headlined 'Cash remains trash'. He argued that any equity price weakness in
response to the monetary changes would be relatively temporary.
He remains optimistic about the outlook for equities in the coming year and
says any fall in prices will represent an excellent medium-term buying
opportunity.
Moreover, Wadhwani points out that individual investors were notoriously
slow to react to changes in interest rates.
He said: 'Looking at the last three troughs in US rates, individual
ownership of equities continued to rise even after interest rates had
started to rise . . .
'Historically, individuals typically will have made only 10 per cent of the
total eventual adjustment to a given change in interest rates after six
months.'
He claimed that because individual investors reacted so gradually, they
still had not adjusted their portfolios fully to the dec-line in rates that
had already occurred.
Consequently, he argued, even if rates began to rise, it was likely that
individual ownership of equities would continue to increase over the next
year.
'The accepted wisdom is that cash is trash. It will surely take more than a
 1/4 percentage point rise in interest rates before cash is king again,' he
added.
What, then, is the private investor to make of such divergent signals and
how are fund managers choosing to react?
Colin McLean, of Scottish Value Management, is encouraged that the Fed acted
when it did. Otherwise, he said, there could have been a nasty shock later.
He added: 'At least it has made some people aware of the risks in the equity
markets and that it is not all a one-way trip.'
McLean does not believe that the change in interest rates has changed the
basic outlook for the UK or Europe.
He feels that stock market prices in Japan may recover later as its economy
improves.
This, however, could have a depressing effect on other Far East markets
which, he suggested, had been supported in the recent rally by a flow of
funds from Japan as well as from the US.
David Rosier (Mercury Asset Management) says it has been clear for some time
that world interest rates could not decline much further.
Consequently, not much more in capital gains could be expected from the bond
markets.
Rosier thinks the rise in US rates can be viewed positively as indicating
the Fed's view that the recovery of the US economy is now robust.
He adds: 'We are seeing a sort of decoupling. The fact that interest rates
have moved in different directions in the US and the UK underlines that the
US economy is ahead of Britain's in the economic cycle.
'Over the past year or two, we have seen stock markets driven by liquidity
and falling interest rates. People have been looking for a home for their
cash and it has gone into stock markets.'
Investors would look now for convincing evidence that companies were
increasing their profits.
Rosier believes the performance of the UK market will be restrained in the
short term until earnings' figures for 1993 provide evidence of corporate
recovery. He recommends that investors should continue to hold relatively
fewer stocks in the US relative to other markets.
While he has become slightly more optimistic about prospects in Japan, he
still does not expect much of a recovery in corporate profits this year. But
he feels the Pacific Basin region continues to offer some interesting
long-term opportunities.
He warns, however, that the markets there are volatile and subject to the
risk of profit-taking after last year's phenomenal performance - especially
if US funds decide to repatriate their holdings.
Rosier thinks there is scope for further interest rate cuts in continental
Europe. But while the area remains attractive, he says investors should take
some profits while valuations remain high.
Nick Train (GT Unit Managers) believes a further  1/4 percentage point rise
in US interest rates is likely in the short term.
He says: 'After a period of unsurprising volatility, we would encourage
investors to think favourably about the US bond market and the US dollar,
and not to re-adjust their thoughts too readily on returns from financial
markets elsewhere.'
He also sees potential problems in Asia and believes that, during the next
nine to 12 months, signs that stock prices have become excessive will emerge
in some Far Eastern markets such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand.
The chart compares the relative performance of four markets: Hong Kong,
Tokyo, London and Europe (excluding the UK).
It shows how the Hang Seng has outperformed Europe and the UK while Japan
has lagged behind.
Andrew Bell (BZW) also believes the emerging markets of the Far East and
elsewhere have become overheated because of the great demand for stocks in
these relatively illiquid centres. He cautions that although emerging
markets are a good long term prospect, this is not the best time to begin
investing in them.
'There is always the danger of trying to be too clever,' Bell says. 'But our
feeling is that, in the next six months, institutions might start taking out
their money.'
This would lead to falls in these markets which might temporarily be greater
 -because they are relatively illiquid - than could be justified from the
fundamental value of the stocks.
Mike Lenhoff (Capel Cure Myers) suggests the global bull market has not
ended just because of the Federal Reserve's move. Instead, he feels some of
the froth has been blown off the top, prompting investors to ask basic
questions about where they had been putting their money.
For instance, asks Lenhoff, do investors want to be paying 20-30 times
earnings for German stocks when the recovery is unlikely to be coming
through until 1995 at the earliest?
He thinks it likely, however, that US interest rates will rise later in the
year. And, in Europe, he feels it remains right to focus on 'peripheral'
markets such as Scandinavia, Italy and Spain rather than those tied to the
D-Mark. 'Over the past two years, the countries which devalued have moved
ahead and secured a definite corporate advantage in the export sector,' he
notes.
Michael Hart (Foreign and Colonial) believes private investors should remain
cautious in present conditions and that interest rates on both sides of the
Atlantic will continue to hold the key to the performance of the equity
markets in the coming year.
He says: 'In the US, the tide of interest rates has turned and we can see
them going on up. The real question now is how far they will move - and that
depends on how the economic data come out week by week.
'The other important influence is Germany, where the economy is still very
depressed and where further interest rate cuts can be expected. The UK will
certainly derive some benefit from further German rate cuts. But if US rates
have to go up faster than expected, then Wall Street could cause some
further vibrations.
'The chances are that UK rates will come down further. But bearing in mind
that the market has had such a tremendous run, investors should not expect
too much, even though the outlook for earnings is quite reasonable.'
Hart believes the safest approach for private investors is to use the
savings schemes run by investment trusts, which spread investments over time
and over a large number of stocks.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: Morsel fails to satisfy the hungry - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toss hungry markets only a morsel and they are likely to turn on you. The
government and Bank of England were taught the lesson this week by equity,
bond and foreign exchange markets. A one-quarter point cut in the base rate
on Tuesday was not what markets were expecting or what they wanted. They
were hoping to feed the bulls a half point in the spring.
Caught on the hop for the second time in three days, the markets were in no
mood to buy the authorities' explanation for the cut. The Bank said it was
appropriate to lower the rate because inflation was well under control. It
forecast that the retail price index minus mortgages would probably be
running at just over 3 per cent by the end of next year, well within the
government's target of 1-4 per cent.
The markets were worried, though, by the Bank's admission that inflation was
more likely to rise than fall. Moreover, the Bank said that getting
inflation into the bottom half of the range would require wage negotiators
and others to lower their inflationary expectations. With a big rise in
taxes looming in April, that was asking a lot.
They worried also that a quarter point cut, the first reduction of such a
modest size in nine years, meant that the bottom of the interest rate cycle
was in sight. All this came after a string of previous signals from the Bank
that there was no need to cut rates in the near term.
If economic logic was lacking then the cut had to be politically inspired,
market participants concluded. Michael Portillo, chief secretary of the
Treasury, did not help by trying to dismiss the fear. 'This has nothing to
do with elections and tax rises,' he said.
With rather unfortunate timing, Eddie George, the Bank governor, had argued
only last Sunday that an independent Bank would sometimes be out of step
with the government. 'There would be circumstances when we would want to see
interest rates higher than the government because we would not be facing the
same short-term political pressures.'
When it came to the day of the rate cut, Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George
went there separate ways, each to do what they do best. The Chancellor
headed for Paris to deliver a speech in French and to lobby for Nigel
Lawson's candidacy for the OECD secretary-generalship. The governor headed
off to Basle for closed-door talks with other central bankers.
Thus unsettled, it was no surprise that the FT-SE 100 finished the week down
96.5 points net at 3,378.9, long-dated gilts lost 1 1/2 points and sterling
lost 2.5 cents against the dollar and 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark.
The contrast with the US was stark. A rise of one-quarter point in the Fed
Funds rate a week ago caused US markets to wobble but by early this week
they had regained their poise. Apparently, they had bought the official line
that a rate rise was a shot across inflation's bows.
High drama marked Monday's opening to the week. How would markets respond to
the big sell-off on Wall Street the previous Friday? They started badly with
the Footsie trading as much as 96 points down at one point in the day and
gilts falling sharply. But the absence of selling by UK institutions, a
recovery in gilts and a rebound on Wall Street brought partial relief.
First thing on Tuesday morning, the focus of the UK markets was yanked back
to domestic questions by the base rate cut. But the long-term repercussions
of the US rate rise will echo through global markets for months to come.
The week's turmoil, inevitably, has heightened the City's debate over where
equities go from here. They are over-valued when judged, for example, by the
index-linked gilts/dividend yield ratio, argues Ian Harnett, chief economist
and market strategist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
They are under-valued, according to Paul Walton, market strategist at James
Capel. He looks back to the early 1980s when the UK economy was in a similar
position about 1 1/2 years after a devaluation and at the end of a big bond
rally. Then as now, the yield ratio of bonds to dividends had plenty of
scope to improve. He asserts that a 2.25 per cent yield ratio, equivalent to
a 3 per cent dividend yield, equates to a level of 3,750 on the Footsie.
Moreover, he expects dividends to grow faster than widely forecast as
companies get into the reporting season over the next few weeks. Next year
could bring a rate of dividend growth near 10 per cent.
Market outperformance of individual stocks this week was limited to a
handful of companies, most of which were connected with bids. Most
impressively, GKN, the vehicle parts maker, launched a hostile bid for the
53 per cent of Westland it does not own. The offer values the helicopter
maker at Pounds 496m: GKN claims there is synergy between its armoured
vehicles and helicopters.
The City was dubious about the logic, coming as it did only a week after
British Aerospace said there was no reason to make both air and ground
vehicles. GKN ended the week down 23p at 557p and Westland, fighting an
improbable battle against such a large minority owner, ended up 29p at 333p.
The betting is GKN will get Westland if it wants it, but at a higher price.
But it was back to feeding time by the end of the week. Governor George
appeared to have learnt Tuesday's lesson. On Thursday evening he attended a
sumptuous banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor to mark this year's tercentenary
of the Bank. Unlike the Barclays manager who recently charged his client for
accepting his lunch invitation, the governor assured his City guests he
would not charge them for the time of all his colleagues present.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: An upset for the banks - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Implausible as it may seem, it was hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for
the bankers who gathered at the Lombard Street headquarters of the British
Bankers' Association to launch their revised code of practice on Tuesday.
No sooner had they explained how much the code had improved since the first
edition was published two years ago, than the public relations exercise fell
apart.
Its destroyer was Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading.
Banks and building societies had, he said, 'wasted an opportunity to make a
step increase in consumer protection'.
The most significant gap he identified was a failure to promise to give
'best advice' to bank customers faced with an array of financial products,
as the banks themselves move further into selling life insurance, mortgages,
investments and pensions.
He was also concerned:
that the code did not properly deal with the practice of passing bank
account details to other companies in the group, which might want to sell
them other financial products;
about the delay of almost three years in introducing a system that will give
customers 14 days' notice of the amount to be be deducted from their
accounts for charges and interest payments; and
that it contained no specific requirement to notify customers personally
when accounts became obsolete and better interest rates were available in
other accounts.
'I intend to pursue these issues directly with banks and building
societies,' he promised. The Office of Fair Trading said that Sir Bryan had
no direct powers to enforce these practices but would use 'moral
persuasion'.
To judge by initial reactions, Sir Bryan will have to be very persuasive to
win over the 289 institutions, which adopt the code voluntarily.
He was disappointed with the code. They were unrepentantly disappointed with
the 'miserly' nature of his comments about the improvements that had been
made - such as the undertaking that customers will be given advance notice
of bank and the tightening of procedures for passing customer information
within a financial group.
Supporters of the code were unimpressed by Sir Bryan's comments about the
selling of financial products. They said this subject was already covered in
some detail in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the structure of
regulation that it established.
But the code's exclusion of one of the activities in which banks and
societies are growing and are competing most fiercely, raises a basic
question about its purpose.
Developed as an alternative to the statutory code of practice recommended by
the Jack committee on banking law, which reported in the late 1980s, it does
set minimum standards for institutions' dealings with personal customers.
But the difficulty with a voluntary code, devised by banks and societies,
however good their intentions, is that where there is a clash, competitive
pressures will usually prove stronger than the code.
Competition will sometimes promote the good service that the code sets out.
When this happens, competition is more effective in promoting customers'
interest than the code could be.
Several high street banks and building societies are, for example, committed
to introducing pre-notification of charges or have already done so. Yet the
code's target date, in order to allow all to meet its requirements, is the
end of 1996.
Improving the code's standards at the pace of the slowest can thus undermine
its effectiveness and limit its value in supporting a customer's complaint.
In other areas, the code's provisions seem too weak or irrelevant to
withstand the pressure to exploit a warm customer base.
Marks and Spencer, for example, has not signed up to the code in spite of
the financial services it provides, because it wants to make full use across
its operations of the customer information it acquires in financial
services. The UK's most profitable retailer must believe that this advantage
outweighs the possibility that some customers may decide against taking out
an M&amp;S personal loan on the grounds that the retailer has not adopted the
banking code.
Similarly, Barclays, which used to insist on the right to pass the details
of new personal bank accounts, to other parts of the group, would doubtless
have dropped this condition earlier, if it had resulted in a loss of custom.
Supporters of the code would argue that the recent change in Barclays'
practice was caused by the impending improvements in the code, and that this
shows the voluntary system's effectiveness. Up to a point. But it is
scarcely an advertisement for the stringency of the code that Barclays was
able to remain a member of the scheme while continuing this practice.
Competition could have a more direct impact on basic standards if banks
would devote more effort to winning each others' personal customers, in
particular through developing more trouble-free ways of moving a current
account. Then people angered by unexpected deductions from an account or by
unwanted approaches from an insurance subsidiary would be inclined to switch
to a rival bank.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: Upbeat news for Reuters - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the international financial information and news group, is
one of the small group of UK-based companies that is indisputably world
class.
The leap in the group's share price to a new high this week reflected not
just the market's welcome of a 4-for-1 share spilt and strong annual
results. It also demonstrated relief that doubts over growth prospects had
been allayed by the group's bullish revenue forecast and upbeat view of its
prospects for developing new products.
Although best known to the public as an international news agency, 90 per
cent of Reuters' revenue comes from financial information and transaction
products. The group's dominant position in the dealing rooms of the world's
financial centres has made it the UK's biggest media group, with a market
capitalisation in excess of Pounds 8.5bn.
Reuters enjoyed rapid growth in the 1980s but its share price fell sharply
in 1990, when the onset of recession caused banks and brokers to retrench.
Shares have more than trebled since, and this week the group said it was
confident that it would enjoy double-digit revenue growth this year, even
although it would hold prices for the third year running.
Investors have also been encouraged by the aggressiveness with which Reuters
has hit the acquisition trail, buying both to strengthen its core financial
expertise and also to test the waters in other areas.
Last month's agreement to buy Quotron, the US data services business, from
Citicorp gave Reuters a 20 per cent share of the North American equity
market - fulfilling a long-held strategic aim of the group. Last year's
Pounds 350m repurchase scheme at Pounds 14 per share was welcomed by
shareholders, but some were concerned that it betrayed a lack of
expansionary opportunities.
A flurry of smaller acquisitions has shown that the group is determined to
benefit from the next generation of so-called multimedia products, which
combine computer data, images and text. This year Reuters will launch a
television service for the foreign exchange market, with live pictures being
delivered digitally to the screens of traders alongside existing currency
data.
In spite of handing back Pounds 350m to shareholders last year through the
buy-back, Reuters still ended last year with net cash of Pounds 450m. It is
this combination of good market position, advanced products and strong cash
generation that makes Reuters look one of the best British bets to prosper
in a multimedia world, if that is indeed where we are heading.
Such qualities do not come cheaply and Reuters shares are currently trading
on a multiple of 24 times prospective earnings. Yet, as the chart shows, the
group's shares have for most of the last year underperformed both the FT
All-Share index as a whole and the media sector.
Reuters cannot look forward to the cyclical bounce in demand that many
smaller companies hope for, and the media sector has been driven by both the
hopes of a quick recovery in advertising volumes and hype over the
relaxation in television ownership rules.
It is also true that the group faces continuing pressure on prices and
fierce competition from other groups, such as Telerate and Bloomberg, which
have targeted its blue-chip customer base and high margins.
However, Reuters continues to roll out new products with impressive
regularity. Dealing 2000-2, its automated foreign exchange dealing system,
continues to grow steadily and the Equity Focus information service has won
a considerable share of the London market. Globex, its automated futures
trading product, is being held up by disagreements with the Chicago
exchanges, but the Instinet equity trading system is showing strong growth
in both volumes and profits.
Reuters' shares may be due for a period of consolidation. They attract a
strong US following and can be volatile when markets are unstable, so buying
at this price is not for the faint-hearted. But the group will continue to
attract long-term investors. In what looks like an over-hyped sector,
Reuters' qualities stand out.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: Nerves afflict the rampant running bulls - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes, stock market investors can be difficult to please. Take the cases
of General Motors and Ford. These two US car makers both reported big
improvements in quarterly and annual earnings this week.
According to their latest results, Ford earned Dollars 719m (Pounds 492.40m)
in the fourth quarter and Dollars 2.5bn in the full-year 1993. In the same
reporting periods of 1992, Ford incurred huge losses. General Motors,
meanwhile, made a profit of Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2.5bn in the latest
quarter and full-year, respectively. Like Ford, GM bounced back from big
losses in 1992.
In spite of these impressive recoveries, investors responded to the
announcements this week by selling Ford and GM shares. On Wednesday Ford
shares fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 1/2 , while a day later GM's stock
dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 1/2 .
In both cases, analysts said investors reacted negatively to the earnings
reports because the figures were in line with, but no better than, market
forecasts. Investors wanted to be pleasantly surprised by the numbers, and
they were not, so they sold.
This behaviour is just one sign that the stock market is getting, as traders
might say, 'a bit toppy'. Equities are expensive by historical standards,
and so long as they remain so, investors will require something out of the
ordinary to keep buying stocks, especially those, such as Ford and GM, that
have had a good run.
The selling of Ford and GM suggested something else: that investors' nerves
are fraying as the greatest bull market in modern history staggers into its
third year. The market may have recovered from last Friday's 96-point
plunge, but the Fed's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in
five years has clearly disturbed investor sentiment, to such an extent that
the market looks increasingly vulnerable to sudden sell-offs.
Thursday was a good example of this. First, shares fell after Elaine
Garzarelli, the high-profile market analyst at Lehman Brothers, said on an
afternoon business television programme that she expected stocks to fall by
between 4 per cent and 7 per cent following a Fed policy tightening.
Garzarelli was saying nothing particularly astonishing or new. She was
simply reiterating her long-held view - one shared by many analysts - that
it would be natural for share prices to undergo a mild correction in the
wake of a rise in interest rates.
Later on Thursday, prices fell further amid a rumour that Goldman Sachs, the
large privately-held Wall Street securities house, had suffered severe
trading losses. While Goldman quickly denounced the rumour as a 'flagrant
falsity', it was enough - coupled with the comments from Garzarelli - to
leave the Dow nursing a 36-point loss at the end of the day.
The market's erratic behaviour this week (before Thursday's big decline the
Dow had been up 35 points on Monday and up another 26 points on Wednesday)
will probably be repeated in the coming weeks, or months. With the threat of
further interest rate increases hanging over equities, share prices are
likely to trade in a range between 3,850 and 4,000, one that is wide enough
to allow the kind of big one-day movements seen this week.
For the Dow to break decisively through 4,000, either some unexpectedly good
corporate news, or further improvements in economic conditions, would be
required. Neither is particularly likely. The next quarterly reporting
season is three months away, and the experiences of Ford and GM show how
hard it is to impress investors these days.
As for the economy, it grew by almost 6 per cent in the last quarter of
1993, an unsustainable rate of expansion in the best of times, but one that
will be particularly hard to improve upon in the first quarter of this year
because the negative impact of President Clinton's tax increases is likely
to start showing up soon in the economic data.
Investors will also have to start worrying about how the tightening of
monetary policy will affect the business climate and the economy. At the
moment, little impact is seen from the quarter-point rise in short-term
interest rates the Fed engineered eight days ago.
Yet, few expect the Fed to leave it at that. Yesterday, the government
announced a 0.4 per cent rise in January producer prices (excluding the
volatile food and energy components). The increase was larger than expected,
and immediately lowered the odds of another interest rate rise within the
next month.
The next tightening might come as early as next week, when the January
consumer price figures are released. Another rate rise, so soon after the
first, is not a pleasant prospect for an increasingly highly-strung stock
market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition for Pep investors' money before the end of the tax year is still
tightly focused on charges. Save &amp; Prosper is halving its initial charge on
its Managed Portfolio Pep to 0.75 per cent, for investments of more than
Pounds 4,000 made between now and the end of the tax year. This also applies
to the S &amp; P Dealing Plan Pep.
Additionally, the initial charge on all the unit trusts available through S
&amp; P's Unit Trust Pep will be cut by one point to 4.5 per cent for the same
period. Annual charges on all the Peps range from 1.25 to 1.5 per cent.
Prolific is cutting the initial charge on unit trust Peps from 5.25 per cent
to 3 per cent, until June 1 this year, so that investors can take out Peps
with the lower initial charge for both tax years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Widows has announced its new bonus rates on with-profits policies
for this year, largely in line with the pattern set by other big life
insurance companies. The bonus rate on the sum assured has been cut from 3.5
to 3 per cent, while the bonus on existing bonuses is down to 5.5 per cent
from 6 per cent. Terminal bonus rates have been improved for all maturities,
after a good year for world stock markets.
A 10-year endowment maturing on February 1, taken out by a man aged 29
paying Pounds 30 a month, is worth Pounds 6,651, up 0.5 per cent from Pounds
6,619 last year. A 25-year policy, on the same basis, would pay Pounds
61,479, up 4.6 per cent from Pounds 58,754 last year.

The stronger yen since the new year reflects doubts about whether Japan and
the US can solve their long-running trade dispute. Japan is under pressure
from the US Congress to cut the size of its trade surplus by increasing
access to important markets, particularly for cars and car parts. On Tuesday
the Japanese parliament passed a Y15.25 trillion fiscal stimulus package
which should lift economic growth and help narrow the trade gap. Yesterday
President Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, met
for trade talks but participants were sceptical about the prospects for much
progress.

lending margins - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies have been taking advantage of the spate of base rate cuts
in the past few years to widen their lending margins. At the beginning of
1991, base rates were 14 per cent while mortgage rates were 14.5 per cent.
The chart shows that lending margins were at their widest towards the end of
1992 when, for a period, base rates were 7 per cent and mortgage rates 9.99
per cent. Lending margins are once again edging towards the same level.

FT  12 FEB 94 / How Rothschild saved the City from collapse: David Kynaston
tells the story of a 19th-century crisis that almost destroyed London as a
financial centre and irrevocably changed the banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID KYNASTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday - that dreadful Saturday l shall never forget - the run
increased to a frightful degree, everybody came in to take out their
balance, no-one brought any money in. One old steady customer, who had
usually Pounds 30,000 there, drew it out without, as is usual, giving any
warning, and in order to pay it the House was left literally empty. Henry
went out to endeavour to borrow but people made shuffling excuses. Old Scott
cried like a child of five years old . . .
That unforgettably dreadful Saturday was December 3 1825. The hysterical
partners all belonged to the private banking firm of Pole, Thornton, Free,
Down &amp; Scott, and the City of London was in turmoil.
It was the worst crisis since the South Sea Bubble of 1720, when hugely
inflated schemes of trade in the Pacific and elsewhere had ended in tears
and acrimony. There had been several other crises since, but none so
threatening to the whole financial and commercial edifice. Everyone knew the
cause, few the remedy.
From the early 1820s the City had been in a state of headlong, uncontrolled,
irrational bullishness - the first of the great 19th-century booms following
the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.
As anyone who has been anxiously watching the market in recent weeks will
understand, stocks can go bounding upwards so long as everyone is confident
that they will continue to rise, but as soon as people begin to lose their
nerve, the whole house of cards can collapse. Even in modern regulated
markets the psychological fundamentals are the same as in the great crisis
of 1825.
In those days, the banking system also depended crucially on confidence,
partly because its capital reserves were inadequate and completely
unpoliced. Protection for investors was minimal; the private sector Bank of
England, little more than a century old, was still groping uncertainly
towards modern notions of central banking; and a host of new entrants from
the continent was flocking into the City to take advantage of London's new
position as the world's dominant financial centre. The square mile was at
this time no place for faint hearts.
One of its specialities was grossly overpriced loans to the newly liberated
countries of Latin America. But at least Colombia, Chile and Peru were all
real places - unlike Poyais, an imaginary country reputedly somewhere in
central America for which bonds were successfully issued.
By late 1825, the bubble in foreign loans and company promotions had burst,
hastened by speculative over-trading in imported commodities, rashness on
the part of the country banks, and a Bank of England policy that veered
between complacency and an over-sharp contraction of credit.
'There will be a general crash,' the Duke of Wellington, who became Tory
prime minister from 1828 to 1830, had predicted in March. He took a grim
satisfaction as events unfolded.
Keeping his head while all around lost theirs, was 28-year-old Henry
Thornton. His sister, Marianne, recorded the events of that terrible day:
'They shut up always at five. At four, he ordered the balance for the day to
be struck, and found that during the next hour they would have to pay Pounds
33,000, and they should receive only Pounds 12,000. This was certain
destruction and he walked out determined to try one last resource.'
He went to a fierce rival, the banking house of Smith, Payne &amp; Smiths and
threw himself at the mercy of John Smith. He said that he could hardly
expect him to lend him money, but if he could get them through until five,
it would be 'an inexpressible relief'. Smith asked if he could give his word
of honour that Pole, Thornton, Free, Down &amp; Scott was solvent. Henry gave
it.
'Well,' continued Marianne, 'then he said they should have everything they
could spare, which was not quite enough tho', for they had been hard-pressed
themselves that day, but he went back with Henry to watch the event. Two
people had chanced to pay in some money whilst Henry had been absent. This,
with what he had borrowed, exactly met the demand upon them. But never, he
says, shall he forget watching the clock to see when five would strike, and
end their immediate terror - or whether any one would come in for any more
payments. The clock did strike at last, and they were safe for the moment .
. .'
Thornton's bank might just have pulled through, but on Thursday, December 8,
news came that Wentworth &amp; Co, a leading Yorkshire bank had failed, owing
Pole's a vital sum which could not be repaid.
Hudson Gurney, the Quaker banker, expressed the fear that gripped the
country that day: 'Who may be able to stand on a general shrinkage nobody
can well foresee.' Adding: 'I have been run to death, apparently doing
nothing, but am utterly bothered in mind and spirit.' Charles Churchill, the
timber broker, declared in his diary on the Saturday: 'The distress for
Money among respectable Dealers &amp; Merchants is beyond anything ever
experienced.'
A tidal run on the country banks was beginning and Henry Thornton was
convinced that there was no alternative but for his bank to stop payment.
'If he had borrowed more money,' Marianne explained, 'it would have only
been to lend to Country Banks, who might all have stopped tomorrow'.
Henry took his decision calmly enough, bringing down over three dozen
country banks. But when he told the City on Monday morning, the reaction was
frenetic.
'The dense fog which prevailed throughout the day was scarcely more gloomy
than the countenances of those who are affected by the present alarming
state of the Money Market,' the Morning Chronicle reported. Tuesday was no
better, as news came that Williams &amp; Co, of Birchin Lane, was in trouble. An
impassable crowd gathered outside that particular banking house. 'Never were
such times,' cried many of the oldest visitors of the exchange, while others
exclaimed: 'If this state of things continues, we must ask not who is gone,
but who stands? For unless something is done to relieve the pressure, and to
restore confidence, few can resist so overwhelming a torrent of distrust.'
On Wednesday, panic mounted and: 'The Royal Exchange was thronged long
before the customary hour of assemblage, and Cornhill, Lombard-street,
Nicholas-lane, and all the streets in which banking-houses are situated,
were crowded to such a degree, as to impede the progress of passengers.'
Police were called and 'kept up a constant cry of 'move on''. Gloom pervaded
the Stock Exchange, where 'in the Foreign Stocks all were on the decline,
and of Home Shares nothing was said except a hearty wish that they were all
in a very warm place'.
The only positive development of the day was a meeting at Mansion House of
about 100 merchants and bankers, who passed a resolution expressing
confidence in the Bank of England's attempts to stem the crisis.
Their confidence was, on the whole, justified. Since the start of the week
the Bank had been making every effort to bolster the market. A key moment
came on Thursday, when Lord Liverpool's Tory government reluctantly gave its
sanction to the Bank issuing Pounds 1 notes for the first time since
Britain's return to the gold standard four years earlier.
Yet by Friday, the situation was as grave as ever. Relations between
government and Bank were at best irascible and Frederick Robinson,
chancellor of the exchequer, was held in contempt by the City for
irresolution. Only one possible saviour was left. The City turned to an
outsider, a foreigner and a Jew, who was held in grudging respect for the
sharpness of his financial dealings.
Nathan Rothschild, one of the greatest financiers of all time, was the third
son of a Frankfurt merchant. He had been based in the City since 1808 and
was already acknowledged as its nonpareil figure. Having made a huge fortune
by conducting audacious bullion operations on behalf of the British
Government during the later stages of the Napoleonic Wars, this was Nathan's
chance to do something similarly striking in peacetime, to save the nation
from financial collapse and make a handsome turn at the same time.
By the end of that Friday he had managed to obtain from the continent up to
Pounds 300,000 in gold, replenishing the Bank of England's barren coffers.
In the era before the telegraph, this was an astonishing feat. Rothschild
had developed a sophisticated private courier and homing pigeon system,
which enabled him to communicate with his brothers in Paris, Frankfurt,
Vienna and Naples, all at the hub of international finance.
This extraordinary family, together with Barings, occupied a position
comparable to that of central banks or even the International Monetary Fund
today. In the rueful words of the brother of the Governor of the Bank of
England: 'The Rothschilds have become the metallic sovereigns of Europe . .
. They have obtained a control over the European exchanges, which no party
ever before could accomplish, and they now seem to hold the strings of the
public purse. No sovereign without their assistance now could raise a loan.'
It was in the full knowledge of Rothschild's efforts that the Iron Duke now
stood firm, telling Liverpool that 'while there was life there was hope'
that the Bank of England must not be allowed to go off the gold standard,
and instead 'the Government were bound to support them to the very utmost of
their power . . . for their interests were those of the country'.
During the next few days the tide turned, and by Christmas confidence had
been restored. Thornton even succeeded in landing a new post. Williams &amp; Co,
although it had stopped payment on the 13th, managed by the end of the year
to reconstitute itself as Williams, Deacon &amp; Co and brought in the
battle-hardened Henry as one of the new partners. There beckoned, for E M
Forster's great uncle, an illustrious career in banking.
It was a profession that was irrevocably changed by the 1825 crisis. A
series of inquiries began which laid the foundations for the modern banking
system. Inadequately capitalised private banks outside London took much of
the retrospective flak, and legislation was passed permitting the
establishment of joint-stock banks outside a radius of 65 miles from London.
Within a few years joint-stock banks, in addition to the Bank of England,
were allowed in London, beginning with the London and Westminster Bank (now
the NatWest) which opened for business in Throgmorton Street in 1834. The
other direct consequence of the crisis was that the Bank of England
tightened its control over the currency, setting up 11 provincial branches
in the late 1820s in order to promote wider use of its own notes.
After the crisis Thomas Love Peacock, poet, novelist and an official of the
East India Company, reflected on the crazy phenomenon in verse, which might
equally well have been an epitaph on the banking follies that caused the
Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s:
Oh] where are the riches that bubbled like fountains,
In places we neither could utter nor spell,
A thousand miles inland 'mid untrodden mountains,
Where silver and gold grew like heath and blue-bell?
Now curst be the projects, and curst the projectors,
And curst be the bubbles before us that rolled,
Which, bursting, have left us like desolate spectres,
Bewailing our bodies of paper and gold.

FT  12 FEB 94 / The Long View: Yielding no quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The building societies this week put forward their candidacy for an Ostrich
Award when they blustered that a mere quarter-point cut in interest rates
was not worth a response. TSB, a retail bank that is one of their most
direct rivals, thought differently, and quickly trimmed its mortgage rate.
As mutual companies, building societies face severe restrictions on how they
may respond to radical changes in the mortgage and savings markets. They
struck it lucky during the inflationary boom periods of the 1970s and 1980s
and were able to grow on an enormous scale. In historically freakish
circumstances their balance sheets expanded at an average annual rate of 15
per cent during those two decades.
But now the growth rate has tumbled to 5 per cent and worse may be to come.
There will always be a place for mutual savings and mortgage banks, but they
might need to become much smaller. To take a pessimistic view, they might
have the same minor relationship to banks as friendly societies, for
instance, have to life assurance companies.
Low interest rates have exposed the vulnerability of building societies.
They suffered net outflows of savings deposits in five of the last seven
months of 1993 - although this is ignoring interest credited, allowing for
which savings rose by Pounds 10.7bn during the year. This result was only
achieved, however, by holding interest rates on savings relatively high,
which has meant that building societies have become uncompetitive on the
mortgage side.
Net mortgage advances have dropped from Pounds 20.6bn to Pounds 9.4bn over
two years. As the banks - notably Abbey National, which converted to banking
status in 1989 - have grabbed business, the building societies' market share
of new house mortgage lending has tumbled from 78 per cent in 1991 to about
55 per cent last year. The building societies cannot expect to get away with
a mortgage rate of, say, 7.64 per cent (the Halifax's at present) when
wholesale money costs 5.25 per cent.
According to calculations by Legal &amp; General, the rise in liquid assets held
by the personal sector last year was about Pounds 15bn when on the basis of
the growth of savings as a whole it could have been expected to be some
Pounds 24.5bn. Thus Pounds 9.5bn went missing - largely into unit trusts.
This hit the banks as much as the building societies, but the banks could
easily raise alternative finance in the wholesale money markets or the
securities markets. Abbey National derives about 50 per cent of its
resources from the wholesale markets, Halifax Building Society only about 15
per cent.
The Building Societies Act imposes a limit of 40 per cent on non-retail
funding, but a safety margin is needed and, in practice, societies operate
well below this level. The ceiling could be raised, and indeed a review of
the Act is under way, but there is an underlying principle that mutual
societies must transact most of their business with members. They always
have the option, after all, of converting to bank plc status if the
straitjacket proves too frustrating.
There might be another way out. The building societies' problem is not just
that the savings flow is too small, but that there is a growing mismatch
between their variable rate savings balances and the increasing popularity
of fixed rate mortgages. The overwhelming proportion of UK householders'
outstanding mortgage debt of some Pounds 350bn is on a variable rate basis,
but at the margin there has been a radical change. Two years ago less than a
fifth of new mortgages had the interest rate fixed for more than a year, but
today the proportion is more than half.
This represents a shift towards the international norm: in Germany 70 per
cent of mortgages are at fixed rates, and in the US 75 per cent. So long as
British inflation remains reasonably low and steady, as the Bank of England
cautiously suggested in its quarterly Inflation Report this week, fixed rate
mortgages will surely become more and more dominant in the UK.
In fact it is really rather odd that so much variable-rate short-term
finance has been available in the UK to finance mortgages. German mortgage
banks have always relied heavily on fixed rate bonds that can be sold on a
secondary market. In the US there has been a big move more recently towards
securitisation of mortgage finance through the bond market.
The building societies are therefore grappling with only the first symptoms
of a potentially fundamental long-term problem of balance sheet structure.
They must persuade their members to contribute fairly long-term fixed rate
savings if on the other side of the balance sheet they are to lend prudently
at fixed rates. But British savers are unaccustomed to buying fixed rate
bonds, and it will take more than reassurances from the Bank of England to
persuade them that inflation is dead.
For the time being societies are keeping their heads down and hoping for a
lucky break. There are rumours that one or two are originating mortgages and
then quietly transferring them to banks, who can obtain matching finance. At
least this is a way for the building societies to keep their operations
ticking over. They have Pounds 220bn of existing mortgages on their books,
on which they can earn a living until the sands of time run out.
They are protected by the cost and inconvenience of refinancing existing
mortgages in the UK, in sharp contrast to the US where refinancing is a vast
business. Also, most borrowers in the UK are unhappy with the idea of making
judgments about interest rates; they prefer to stick to what they see as the
relative safety of floating rates. Again, an extended period of stable
interest rates may change this attitude.
So might the persistence of uncompetitive mortgage rates, which is where we
are now. Within a year or two the building society sector may have to
shrink, which would happen through further important defections to
proprietary banking status.

FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke/Burford
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke's sale of a parcel of properties for Pounds 103m provides comfort
on two fronts. First, it highlights the new management's determination to
reduce its Pounds 1.3bn debt by selling off the more extreme parts of Mr
Cyril Stein's sprawling empire. Second, it hints that Ladbroke's properties
may indeed be worth what the accounts suggest, which has been a worry in the
market. That said, the deal has more significance in terms of sentiment than
substance for Ladbroke. The cash inflow is unlikely to prevent the company
from chopping its dividend. Ladbroke retains another Pounds 760m of
commercial property which may prove more difficult to shift.
It is easy to understand Burford's delight. The company has been quick off
the mark in securing a deal with one of the few sellers in the market.
Moreover, Burford is issuing new paper at a 27 per cent premium to its net
asset value to buy properties with an initial yield of 8.4 per cent. That
equation will immediately enhance asset values and earnings.
The package of properties contains a fair mix of investment grade assets and
dull office buildings. But it would be surprising if Burford failed to push
the yields higher with more active management. The expansion of Burford's
equity base should also enable it to gear up to buy riskier but more
rewarding secondary sites. That is where the investment money is now
heading.

FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The virtuous circle of a rising equity market linked to higher gilts and
sterling was well and truly broken this week. Thanks to the Federal Reserve
tightening and the UK authorities' fumbled presentation of Tuesday's rate
cut the sparkle has gone out of all three markets at once. Yet if the circle
cannot be mended, the markets need not continue to feed off each other's
fall.
Equities should reap some benefit from the weaker currency, which will be
useful in the light of yesterday's trade figures showing lower export
volumes. Much depends on whether earnings and dividend growth is sufficient
to support share prices. It is too early in the results season to draw any
firm conclusions, though dividend increases from Reuters and Lloyds Bank of
23 and 20 per cent respectively offer some encouragement.
Gilts may have a harder time, especially if US bonds refuse to settle down.
Indeed the Bank of England seems defiant in planning an auction with a
maturity of up to 10 years. Perhaps it believes foreign buyers will return,
but its announcement left open the option of a six-year issue if they do
not.

FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad debts have fallen at Lloyds Bank, but it is evidently still uneasy about
the lingering impact of recession on its customers. Queens Moat, among other
corporate banking surprises, caused it to draw fully on that division's 1992
general provision. Now it has made a Pounds 70m general provision to cover
latent problems across the group as a whole. General provisions amount to
0.7 per cent of customer advances, compared with only 0.4 per cent five
years ago.
Lloyds may be right in expecting aftershocks from the recession, but a
broader issue is at stake. Should banks which have suffered undreamt of loan
losses in the last few years, use better times to stock up on general
provisions? The question must interest those like Barclays which have been
particularly badly hit. The conventional objection is that this is mere
smoothing of profits. Yet the existing system - whereby banks book profits
for a loan over several years and then suddenly write down the principal
when it goes sour - also distorts the true earnings picture. The real
difficulty lies in finding an objective measure of the actual risk of
default to prevent managements from using general provisions to manipulate
profits.
As to Lloyds' operating profits, they present a familiar picture. Strip away
the benefit to net interest income from the Argentine back interest payment
and the increased securities gains, and there is little sign of organic
growth. That dividend increases are insufficient compensation explains why
Lloyds has underperformed the banking sector by 24 per cent over the past
year.

For an academic, Professor Stephen Littlechild has a curious fondness for
blunt engineering solutions. Faced with the complex but failing market in
electricity generation, the regulator has finally settled for giving it a
couple of healthy bangs with the hammer. Whether these will actually make
the market function any more effectively is a moot point. The price cap
applied for the next two years will have a marginal impact on National Power
and PowerGen's profitability - shaving perhaps 5 per cent from earnings per
share growth. But that will not disturb the companies' ability to increase
dividends, so the current share price ratings look underpinned.
The sale of power plant is also unlikely to damage the companies much, given
that they only have to sell stations if they can get decent prices. More
significantly, control of the price-setting mechanism is still likely to
remain with the two big generators, as they will continue to own most of the
relevant plant. The generating market is split between a large
price-insensitive block of nuclear and gas stations and another block of
price-sensitive coal plant. Marrying the two into some kind of single market
will require the kind of fundamental reforms that have just been ducked.
The generators will presumably split up their plant sales so that no one
competitor has a significant market share. Demerging a package of plant as a
separate stock market company would ensure that shareholders retained the
value of these stations. National Power and PowerGen have bought themselves
a couple of trouble-free years and the outcome is certainly better for them
than a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. But similar issues will
remain in 1996, leaving Prof Littlechild with a problem. As the market
becomes more crowded, the vexed question of the independent producers'
long-term contracts to buy expensive gas for their new stations will come
back to haunt him too.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Lloyd's may ease deadline for Pounds 900m settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London may extend the deadline on its Pounds 900m out-of-court
settlement offer to lossmaking Names.
The insurance market had set a Monday deadline for the deal, designed to end
litigation by some 17,000 individual members seeking compensation for
losses.
Lloyd's said the proposed settlement would be withdrawn unless at least 70
per cent of the value of the offer was taken up by the lossmaking Names.
However, it is now understood that if a significant number of Names - the
individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - accept
the deal, a short extension of the offer period will be considered. It seems
likely that at least half the value of the offer would have to be taken up
before that option went ahead.
The deadline for the deal has already been extended once, from January 31 to
February 14. But under the original conditions of the offer, announced in
December last year, Lloyd's may vary the deadline again.
Leaders of action groups - who are organising legal action on behalf of
lossmakers - remain confident that the offer will be rejected. At meetings
last month, lossmakers voted by majorities of at least five to one to reject
the settlement in favour of legal action. Only one out of 38 action groups
has voted to accept.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action group, which is
organising the biggest legal action, says that his group will go ahead with
legal action irrespective of the overall response from Names to the offer.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, whose case is
scheduled to come to court in October, said he could not see any value in
keeping the offer open.
'It just prolongs the agony,' he said, although he acknowledged that some
Feltrim Names who had voted in favour of rejection last month might have
subsequently accepted the offer.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Brother of Berlusconi faces corruption inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The political ambitions of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate,
were threatened yesterday when Milan magistrates issued an arrest warrant
for his brother, Paolo, on suspicion of corruption.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi staked his claim last Sunday to lead Italy at the head
of his new movement, Forza Italia, amid signs of a strong showing in the
opinion polls.
His brother's troubles came on the day Mr Berlusconi announced an electoral
pact with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi to fight the
March 27 general election. The combined movement stands a good chance of
picking up more than a third of the total vote.
Aides of Mr Berlusconi insist that he cannot be condemned for unproven
allegations against his brother Paolo. But the Italian media, generally
hostile to Mr Berlusconi's political ambitions and concerned at his use of
his near monopoly of commercial television for self-promotion, will try
their best to use the issue against him.
Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi said the magistrates' move was politically
motivated.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi, who handed himself over to the authorities yesterday,
is being questioned about alleged payments made in connection with property
development on the outskirts of Milan.
That in turn is part of a broader inquiry into the affairs of the pension
fund of Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank whose chairman, Mr Roberto
Mazzotta, was arrested on Monday.
Cariplo officials are accused of conducting a series of fraudulent property
transactions to hide political pay-offs.
Between 1983 and 1986, three Berlusconi properties were sold to the Cariplo
pension fund for some L22bn (Pounds 8.8m), magistrates claim. Mr Paolo
Berlusconi is alleged to have paid bribes totalling more than L900m to a
Cariplo official. The money was then split between local politicians,
intermediaries and bank officials.
When the allegations appeared this week, Mr Paolo Berlusconi's lawyers
denied that any such payments had been made.
Paolo, aged 43, is widely regarded as having grown up in his elder brother's
shadow. In 1992 he came to prominence when Silvio split some of his
newspaper interests and the construction business, Cantieri Milanese
Riuniti, from the Fininvest group and placed them with his brother.
However, Mr Silvio Berlusconi made the move to avoid anti-trust legislation
and is thought to have continued to take a close interest in the
construction business, which he founded.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi has already had one brush with Milan magistrates last
year and is to stand trial with 34 others for alleged corruption related to
waste disposal contracts.

FT  12 FEB 94 / NHS 'elite' earn Pounds 400,000 a year from private practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most highly-paid National Health Service doctors earn an extra
Pounds 400,000 a year from private practice, a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission report showed yesterday.
A survey conducted for an MMC inquiry into private medical services showed
that these pre-tax earnings were achieved in 1992 by an elite group of about
40 consultants through treating private patients. The income was in addition
to their NHS salaries, which ranged from Pounds 37,905 to Pounds 48,945 in
1992-93.
Some 35 per cent of consultants also received distinction awards of between
Pounds 9,935 and Pounds 47,200.
The government yesterday accepted an MMC recommendation that the British
Medical Association should be prohibited from publishing guidelines on fees
for undertaking private practice. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs
minister, said consultants following the guidelines were able to 'charge
higher fees than would otherwise be possible'.
The Pounds 400,000-plus consultants were only 0.3 per cent of all doctors
earning more than Pounds 1,000 a year from private work. The MMC report
revealed another similar-sized group that earned more than Pounds 300,000 in
1992.
Plastic surgeons were shown as the specialist group with the highest private
earnings, with typical incomes ranging between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds
75,000 gross.
The MMC says consultants' earnings from private practice are estimated to
have risen almost eightfold between 1980 and 1992, from Pounds 74m to Pounds
570m.
The report estimates that consultants' median pre-tax earnings in 1992 were
Pounds 42,000 from the NHS and Pounds 17,000 from private practice. But
about 6,000 NHS consultants undertook no private work at all, while a
further 2,000 senior doctors earned less than Pounds 1,000 from it.
Full-time NHS consultants should not earn more than 10 per cent of their
salaries from private practice, but there is no limit for part-time
consultants.
Consultants typically spend 50 hours a week on NHS duties.

FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Share prices recover before
abrupt halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a sharp downturn yesterday morning, US share prices recovered to
finish at mixed levels in a session cut short because of severe winter
weather, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.56 at 3,894.78 by 2.30pm, when
blizzard conditions forced an abrupt halt to the trading day. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.25 better at 470.18. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 1.93 to 477.20, and the
Nasdaq composite 2.03 to 781.39.
NYSE volume was light, with 219m shares exchanged in the abbreviated
session. But the snow prevented many from reaching their offices, so
activity was thin all day. That left the narrowly based Dow industrial index
vulnerable to sharp swings.
The first came in mid-morning. After a weak opening, share prices jumped 16
points in minutes as the US Treasury market began to extend some early
gains.
The rally in bonds was surprising in view of the day's mixed economic news.
The Commerce Department said that January producer price index had risen
only 0.2 per cent, less than forecasts of 0.3 per cent. But the core index,
excluding food and energy prices, was a little higher than anticipated.
Retail sales, meanwhile, showed a 0.5 per cent decline, but the data was
distorted by last month's frigid weather.
Near midday, equities struck an independent course from bonds after a drop
in the stock-index futures market triggered program sales. Analysts linked
the downturn to technical factors, rather than any fundamental economic
news.
At one stage, the Dow industrials had shed more than 22 points, but the
blue-chip index shifted direction once again in the early afternoon and
share prices pulled back to near their starting points.
Automobile stocks again led the blue chips. General Motors fell Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 61, Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 and Chrysler Dollars
1 to Dollars 58 3/4 . Both GM and Ford posted strong earnings earlier in the
week, but investors appeared disappointed that forecasts had not been
surpassed.
In the healthcare sector, Columbia HCA was near the NYSE's most active list
a day after shareholders of the two companies approved a merger. The stock
was marked down Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 in volume of nearly 3.9m
shares, after the companies, listed separately, posted big gains the
previous session.
In computer stocks, Storage Technology gave back nearly all of its recent
gains after the company briefed analysts on its Iceberg computer storage
system. The issue slid Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 .
Canada
Toronto prices closed lower in relatively light trading, continuing the
downward trend that started yesterday afternoon.
The TSE-300 composite index fell 36.37 points, or 0.82 per cent, to
4,405.60. Declining issues outnumbered advances 498 to 307.
Volume was 67.08m, down from Thursday's 90.86m shares, and trading value
fell to CDollars 761.8 from CDollars 992.0m.
The market opened lower and had slumped more than 50 points by
mid-afternoon, before recovering some ground late in the session.

FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Latin America): Brazil closes up 3.4%
in pre-Carnival burst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian stocks closed up 3.4 per cent in heavy trade, buoyed by a strong
inflow of foreign money, in advance of next week's Carnival holiday.
The Bovespa index of the 54 most-active shares ended at 10,354 points, up
345 points. Brazil's bourses will remain closed until Wednesday. Trading
will resume on Thursday.
Volume finished high at Crz205.2bn (Dollars 378.1m). State telecom company
Telebras rose 1.8 per cent to Crz28.60.
The Rio de Janeiro ISENN index added 1,922 points, or 5.2 per cent, to
39,136, up from Thursday's 37,214, and 3.5 per cent higher in real terms.
Brazilian stocks have surged around 55 per cent in dollar terms so far this
year.
Investors are also awaiting news on Sao Paulo state water and sewage utility
Sabesp's forthcoming share launch. Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao
Paulo state, announced on Thursday that he wanted Sabesp to go public over
the next 30 days.
The Mexican bolsa was down moderately at the close, as profit-taking that
began two days ago continued.
The key IPC index of 36 leading shares dropped 16.38 points, or 0.58 per
cent, to 2,802.06 on volume of 123.38m shares. Falls outnumbered gains by 59
to 47.
Traders said profit-taking drove the market down to what technical analysts
consider its support level of 2,800. Following recent declines, analysts
said the market was likely to begin climbing toward 2,900 again.

FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses volatile, reflect US
equity sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overnight weakness on Wall Street weighed on bourses for most of the day,
and a modest early rally in the Dow yesterday on producer price inflation
figures was petering out as late-closing bourses came to the finishing line,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, waiting for a resolution to the metal wage negotiations, saw the
Dax index fall 28.35 to 2,090.61 on the session, 2.2 per cent down on the
week, and recover to 2,108.77 in the post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM9.9bn to DM9.6bn. The day, like the week, was marked by
weakness in banks and strength in the automotive sector, said Mr Eckhard
Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, BMW and Daimler recovering well in the
afternoon and Continental, up DM2.80 to DM259.30 against the trend,
reflecting a 3-5 per cent price increase by its General Tire subsidiary in
the US.
VDO Schindling preferred soared DM62, or 23 per cent to DM328.50 on the
DM330 bid for outstanding stock from its majority shareholder, Mannesmann.
Metallgesellschaft's Buderus subsidiary rose DM32.50 to DM647.50 on a 37 per
cent rise in profits in the December quarter.
PARIS featured Canal Plus, the pay television group, as the reorganisation
of its shareholding structure was put into place. Under the new arrangement
the three main shareholders, Havas, Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale
will regroup their holdings into one. Havas will have a controlling interest
under the new arrangement, and its shares rose FFr4.00 on the day to
FFr472.50.
Canal Plus lost FFr15 to FFr1,088, Generale FFr11 to FFr2,776 and SocGen
FFr8 to FFr700. In the broader market activity was restrained, leaving the
CAC-40 off 21.68 at 2,275.09, a week's loss of 2.4 per cent.
AMSTERDAM's day fell into two segments: morning weakness in reaction to Wall
Street, and a recovery later on the early Wall Street trend. The AEX index
ended off 2.95 at 434.37, up from the day's low of 428.89, for a week's fall
of 0.6 per cent.
Royal Dutch went against the trend on strong US support, said brokers at
MeesPierson in Amsterdam, and closed Fl 3.70 higher at Fl 215.40. It was
also lifted by good results from BP on Thursday.
KNP BT came in with results much in line with expectations, to close off 80
cents at Fl 49.70, while Fokker, one of the week's most active issues,
dipped 60 cents to Fl 23.10, a week's rise of 5.5 per cent.
ZURICH picked up its lows but the SMI index shed 26.5 to 2,985.7, for a 5.7
per cent fall on the week. Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich
noted that the market had made encouraging starts to several recent sessions
before sales of derivative instruments linked to blue chip stocks had led
the cash market lower.
He added that much of the selling came from institutions, while foreign
sales had swelled trading volumes as investors took profits and, at the same
time, booked currency gains.
Ascom bearers plunged SFr60 or 4.7 per cent to SFr1,220: the troubled
telecommunications group announced late on Thursday that its chief financial
officer was leaving with immediate effect. Motor-Columbus, the energy and
telecommunications group, fell SFr30 to SFr1,720 after a UBS board member
said that the bank wanted to sell part of its near-40 per cent stake.
MILAN finished flat, the Comit index rising 0.88 to 680.71 for a 1.3 per
cent gain on the week. Kleinwort Benson, which maintains its overweight
recommendation, said that investors were betting on a left wing victory in
next month's elections.
Banks were mixed after Thursday's warning from Moody's, the US credit
ratings agency, that downward pressure on their credit ratings will persist
over the next few years. Credito Italiano fell L28 to L2,614. BCI, subject
to a stream of bullish analysts' reports ahead of privatisation, added L60
to L5,530.
Ferruzzi put on L142 or 7 per cent to L2,184 amid speculation that a public
buy offer could be triggered by changes in the holding's share structure
following the capital increase which closed on Wednesday.
Snia, Fiat's chemicals and synthetic fibres subsidiary, added L55 to L1,990
amid renewed speculation that it may be sold.
MADRID ended 3.32 lower at 347.98 after 344.65. The general index was down
2.4 per cent in the week.
Turnover was Pta48.4bn. Telefonica fell Pta60 to Pta2,060 on a judgement of
Solomon from Goldman Sachs, which said it had removed the company from its
European priority and recommended lists, but continued to rate is as a
market performer in the US.

FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gentle Australian upturn
as holidays quieten region
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo had its own holiday yesterday and this, with the Chinese new year
celebrations, meant that most of the region's markets were closed.
Among those which were open, activity was generally restrained.
AUSTRALIA recovered from an unsteady start to close higher in spite of
limited offshore buying and lower gold stocks.
The All Ordinaries index added 7.1 to 2,241.4 in turnover of ADollars
659.6m, off 4 per cent on the week.
News Corp came back from a session low of ADollars 9.80 to close 2 cents up
at ADollars 10.16. BTR Nylex was up 13 cents at ADollars 3.26 in volume of
2.8m shares.
BHP firmed 8 cents to ADollars 18.48, after falling to ADollars 18.28.
Coca-Cola Amatil was one of the day's main movers, climbing 40 cents to
ADollars 11.20 in volume of 1.4m shares after announcing a record annual
profit of ADollars 95.4m.
In golds the index shed 73.1 or 3 per cent to 2,352.3 on profit-taking.
Placer Pacific fell 21 cents to ADollars 2.54, Normandy Poseidon 15 cents to
ADollars 2.25 and Newcrest Mining 31 cents to ADollars 6.05.
Among resource stocks, Western Mining was 10 cents down at ADollars 7.60 but
off session lows after reporting a 38 per cent rise in interim net profit.
NEW ZEALAND slipped back in thin turnover, with Telecom losing 7 cents to
NZDollars 4.58. The NZSE-40 index lost 14.38 to 2,349.50, up 0.6 per cent
over the week.
Air New Zealand, which announced a profit of NZDollars 88m for the six
months to December 31, ended down 3 cents at NZDollars 4.04.
MANILA rose on strength in the banking sector and second-line stocks. The
composite index gained 27.14 to 3,040.90, a week's improvement of nearly 1
per cent. Turnover rose to 1.2bn pesos from 973m pesos.
Philippine National Bank led the gainers to close uo 4 per cent at 630
pesos.
BOMBAY fell after the Calcutta stock exchange set carry forward costs at
4.0-4.5 per cent, compared with 2 per cent in Bombay. The BSE index lost
39.16 at 4,000.74 for a week's decline of 2 per cent.

FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Japanese funds ask questions after
January rally - The latest economic stimulus package excludes stock market
support measures
</HEADLINE>

The record Y15,250bn economic stimulus package announced by the government
earlier this week excluded stock market support measures, featured in the
previous three pump-priming packages presented over the past two years.
With the Nikkei average of 225 leading stocks safely over 19,000, government
officials are no longer losing sleep over the Tokyo stock market, which has
given the country's financial community a few nightmares since its plunge in
1990.
The leading force in the recent rise of Japanese share prices, however, has
been buying by foreigners. The Nikkei rose 16.1 per cent during January, as
overseas investors poured funds into Tokyo. US and European asset allocators
increased their weightings in Japan after sharp rises in south-east Asian
markets last year increased their downside risk.
A record Dollars 12bn in overseas funds was pumped into the Tokyo stock
market during January, and foreign fund managers piled into sectors such as
automobiles, electronics and steels.
The big question now is whether the Japanese institutional investors will
follow suit or the rally just be a 'foreigner' phenomenon. The argument for
domestic investors to join the buying is supported by low interest rates,
the bottoming out of the economy and corporate profits, and currency risk
acting as a deterrent to overseas investment.
Some economists are hopeful that corporate profits will improve this year
due to the sharp fall in depreciation. The predicted weakening of the yen is
also expected to support sales at leading exporters. However, the Nikkei 225
is now on a prospective p/e of 100, seriously worrying the fundamentalists.
Baring Securities advises an exposure of 42 per cent to the Japanese market
for a world fund. It is telling investors not to be frightened by the high
price/earnings ratios, saying that cheap stocks do not always rise and
stocks considered expensive do not necessarily fall. Foreign analysts hope
that the Y43,000bn held by Japanese investors in liquid deposits will start
flowing into the equity market, pushing up shares even further.
However, most Japanese investors remain cautious, arguing that underlying
economic fundamentals have not changed drastically, and that it is foreign
liquidity which has pushed share prices up. 'It's not as if corporate
earnings will recover immediately and buying by foreigners won't last
forever,' says a fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life
assurer.
Domestic investors also faceno risk from lack of exposure to Japanese
stocks, since most of their holdings are in the Tokyo market.
Behind these big institutional concerns lies persistent gloom over the
country's economy. Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura
Securities, sees the real gross domestic product for the year ending March
1995 contracting by 0.4 per cent after shrinking 0.6 per cent in the current
year.
The effects of the economic stimulus package, including the income tax cut
on the corporate economy are expected to be minimal since, of the Y7,200bn
slated for public investment, almost 40 per cent is accounted for by prior
land acquisition for public work projects; and consumers, many of whom face
an increasing possibility of losing their jobs, are unlikely to spend the
extra income from their tax cuts.
Morgan Stanley in Tokyo points out that the impact of Y5,850bn in tax cuts
may be delayed significantly, for technical reasons. 'The delay in
announcing the stimulus package and the following political fiasco have
undermined the necessary consumer and business confidence that the package
was supposed to achieve,' says Ms Mineko Sasaki Smith, a Morgan Stanley
economist.
Meanwhile, corporate profits are expected to remain sluggish for the next
few years, due to the slow reduction in fixed labour costs. NRI forecasts a
22.4 per cent fall in its earnings of leading 400 companies for the current
year to March followed by a mere 2.9 per cent rebound in the next fiscal
year.
Another lingering concern for the investment community ahead of the March
year-end is the oversupply stemming from profit-taking, by corporations
improving their poor earnings through sales of their long term stock
portfolios. 'Corporate investors withheld their selling when the market was
going up, but will start unloading their shares when the momentum dies
down,' says one Japanese fund manager.
Growing arbitrage positions are also adding to Japanese institutional
worries. Long positions held against futures contracts totalled Y1,201bn
after the first week of February, the highest level since Y1,380bn in
October last year. The funds are afraid that a fall in futures prices could
trigger an unwinding.
For now, Japanese brokers are keeping their fingers crossed that foreign
buying support will last long enough to take the Nikkei safely through the
March book closing period. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities is betting on
the index closing the fiscal year at around 20,500.
