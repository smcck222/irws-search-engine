FT  29 MAR 94 / Court procedures may be simplified
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A review of civil court procedures in England and Wales is to be carried out
by Lord Justice Woolf, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor,
announced yesterday.
He said in a Lords written reply: 'My aim is to reduce the cost of
litigation, simplify the rules and remove unnecessary distinctions of
practice and procedure.'
The review, expected to last two years, also aims to improve access to
justice.
Although the High Court and county courts have their own rules and
procedures, the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 resulted in the removal
of many jurisdictional limits in county courts.
The Lord Chancellor said he supported the recommendation of the Civil
Justice Review that there should be a common core of procedural rules in the
High Court and county courts.
Lord Woolf will be assisted by a small team of experts with a secretariat
provided by the Lord Chancellor's Department.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Compensation for Lockerbie road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pan Am, the former US airline, has paid more than Pounds 175,000 in
compensation for damage to a road caused when Flight 103 was blown out of
the sky over Lockerbie in 1988.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, started legal action against the airline
last week when it was thought that the bill was unpaid.
The action alleged negligence by Pan Am for the explosion over Lockerbie
which killed 270 people in that the airline failed to prevent explosive
devices being taken on board the aircraft.
But it turned out that Pan Am's insurers had wired the money from the US two
weeks ago. The Scottish Office admitted that there had been an
administrative 'blip'.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Mercury agrees to recognition talks with union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the main telecoms rival to British Telecommunications, has agreed
to a formal meeting with leaders of the National Communications Union to
discuss recognition of the NCU in the wake of threats by unions to block its
expansion abroad.
Union officials say that the international business of Mercury's parent,
Cable and Wireless, seems to be suffering from an 'anti-union' image.
A joint venture with Telecom Eireann is threatened because of Irish union
objections, and the Belgian telecommunications union was influential in
preventing C&amp;W winning business in Belgium last year.
C&amp;W could face similar problems in South Africa and in northern European
countries with strong social partnership traditions.
Mercury is unlikely to concede anything to the NCU in the short-term - it
has always maintained that it is not anti-union, but opposes collective
bargaining.
Some officials say that, given the international pressure, Mercury may be
interested in a hybrid status for the union, which would still exclude the
union from collective bargaining but give it some formal representational
role.
They also point to the fact that Bell Canada, which recognises unions, now
owns about 20 per cent of the company.
The NCU has about 900 members among the 10,500 staff, partly the result of a
recruitment campaign in the past two years.
The union has been allowed access to staff on some occasions and has
represented members in unfair dismissal and equal opportunity cases. Its
representatives have not been subject to company pressure.
The immediate reason for the meeting appears to be an article in the
December issue of Messenger, the Mercury staff journal, which was critical
of the NCU recruitment campaign and said that in the 10 years of Mercury's
existence it had received no request for recognition from the NCU.
The NCU responded with a letter to Mr Robert Johnston, Mercury's personnel
director, disputing the article and requesting a formal meeting to table a
recognition claim. The meeting will take place on April 26.
Mr Tony Young, the NCU general secretary, said: 'I hope we can have a
constructive and positive meeting but we will be making it clear that the
NCU are here to stay in Mercury, as evidenced by our establishing three new
NCU-Mercury organisations this month.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / Council tax to rise by average of 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Council tax will increase by an average of 2.1 per cent, rather than the
government prediction of 7 per cent, when its second year starts next month.
The figures, published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, show that Liverpool, where no party has overall control, will
have the highest tax. This year's average for properties in band D  - priced
between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 - will rise 19.5 per cent to Pounds
866.72. This is followed by the Labour- controlled cities of Manchester and
Newcastle upon Tyne, with Pounds 777.62 and Pounds 725.20.
Conservative-controlled Westminster, where councillors were accused this
year of gerrymandering, has the lowest tax - Pounds 245 for band D.
Councils said the government's new formula for allocating grants to councils
had caused most of the differences.
Three Labour councils have set taxes above government limits and might be
'capped'.
Langbaurgh on Tees in Cleveland is preparing to spend Pounds 17.3m, rather
than its 'cap' of Pounds 16.6m. Slough in Berkshire left its budget
unchanged at Pounds 15.16m, but suffered the biggest cut in standard
spending, according to Local Government Chronicle - from Pounds 16.5m to
Pounds 14.25m. Sheffield set a budget of Pounds 384m, Pounds 6m above its
capping limit.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Imro to end Pounds 1m fines ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 1m upper limit on fines imposed under informal disciplinary
proceedings by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management
industry, is to be abolished as part of its proposals to streamline
discipline procedures.
The move is set out in a consultation paper published by Imro yesterday. The
limit was increased last October from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 1m and the
new proposal brings the informal procedures into line with the formal
process, where there is no ceiling on fines.
The plans include merging the investigation and disciplinary committees into
an enforcement committee to oversee investigations and agree settlements of
disciplinary cases.
Mr Dan Waters, Imro's enforcement director, said that the drive behind the
proposals, which are due to come into effect on 1 August, had come from
Imro's decision to introduce individual registration, and from a general
need to make the disciplinary procedures more effective.
He emphasised that the heaviest fines would be directed at cases where there
had been a loss to investors or a systemic failure of compliance
arrangements, but that smaller Imro members would not 'be fined out of
existence'.
Twice last year Imro imposed fines of more than Pounds 700,000, with the
record of Pounds 750,000 being imposed on Invesco MIM, the fund management
group.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Advisers told to delay applications to PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent financial advisers have been urged by their trade associations
not to send their applications to join the Personal Investment Authority -
the new watchdog to protect private investors - until its future is settled.
Mr Garry Heath, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent
Financial Advisers, wrote last Friday to his organisation's members
recommending that they should fill in application forms, but not post them
for at least a month.
In its prospectus, published in February, the PIA set a deadline for
applications of April 5, but it is already clear this time-limit will not be
met by many potential members.
Mr Heath's memorandum highlighted the uncertainty over the PIA's future
after last week's refusal by Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, to
join the PIA, and the serious reservations expressed by other large
organisations, such as Halifax building society.
'In the light of this uncertainty we see no reason why IFAs should rush to
join the PIA,' he said.
'If you had recommended to your clients that they placed their futures in
such a shaky enterprise, you would quite rightly have been disciplined.'
A similar message to that issued by the federation is going to members of
the British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association. The two
organisations have already announced their intention to merge.
Businesses that are subject to existing regulators at the moment will not
have to pay an application fee if they miss the deadline, provided that they
apply before the PIA becomes operational in July.
But the PIA said yesterday that it regretted the NFIFA's advice and urged
companies to apply by the early April date.
It was confident of being able to process applications received by the
deadline in time for the start of the new regulatory regime. However,
applicants that missed that date might have to continue with their existing
regulator for some time after the PIA had become effective.
So far, the PIA has received more than 800 applications. It estimates
potential membership at about 6,000 companies

FT  29 MAR 94 / Pay blamed for shortfall in scientists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry may soon face a shortfall in well-qualified scientists and
engineers because of a decline in their relative pay over the past decade,
ministers warned yesterday.
The warning came after a survey for the education department showed that the
relative pay of private-sector engineers and scientists has fallen since
1980.
Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service and science, said:
'Ultimately, there is nothing I can do to force firms to pay people properly
and send the right market signals. If they want to raise quality, pay
signals help that.'
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said employers had 'some hard questions
to answer'. The report was commissioned after last August's results for
A-levels - the main examinations for university entrance in England and
Wales - showed falls in the number taking science, including a drop of 9.6
per cent in physics.
It found that pay for male scientists fell from 15 per cent above the
white-collar average in 1980 to 10 per cent last year.
In engineering the fall was from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, while computing
salaries fell from 11 per cent to only 1 per cent above average. Over the
same period, pay for accountants rose from 11 per cent above average in 1980
to 17 per cent in 1993. The report says: 'The trend of relative pay for
scientists and engineers over the 1980s is clear: it was falling, albeit
erratically.'
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report. It added that the
evidence on pay signals was not strong enough to reach any firm conclusions.
Mr Patten will be holding consultations on the report over the next three
months.
Other findings were that the proportion of school pupils taking A-levels
only in science and mathematics fell from 30 per cent in 1984 to 17 per cent
in 1993, while those taking only arts subjects rose from 41 per cent to 49
per cent.
There had been a marked shift since 1988 toward 16-year-olds taking exams in
combined science rather than individual subjects.
Independent school pupils were much more likely to take single subjects.
Entry standards to higher education were slightly lower than average for
sciences, with engineers requiring 20 A-level points (where 10 are awarded
for a grade A, and 2 for an E), while the average for all subjects was 21.1.
Law required 25.7 and accountancy 22.1.
Mr Waldegrave highlighted the fact that the problem was not unique to the
UK. He said that France also had problems attracting science undergraduates,
while the Japanese government had published a white paper on combating the
'serious problem of undervaluing science and engineering graduates'.
The education department's survey of undergraduates also discovered that
students were deterred from taking sciences because the courses were
'extremely hard work' and 'too fiddly'.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Brussels backs Britain over 'mad cow disease'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK has won strong backing from Brussels over Germany's threat of a
unilateral ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease',
or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The European Commission told Germany it would take legal action if Bonn
attempted to introduce a unilateral ban.
Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover for
action against the UK.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, complained yesterday that
'the hysterical reaction in Germany' had already caused 'measurable damage
to British trade'.
In January and February beef exports to Germany had fallen to less than one
eighth of annual levels two years ago. But Mrs Shephard said the damage had
spread to include cancelled contracts for British pork, lamb and even
whisky.
There was also, she said, a knock-on effect into neighbouring countries such
as Belgium, where a fast-food chain had just cancelled a large order of
British beefburgers. Mrs Shephard did not rule out the possibility of
seeking legal redress.
Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK
after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. The commission
has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that
there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which
Britain and the commission say are working.
In 1990 certain bovine offals, such as brain and spleen, were banned for
human consumption. Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of
live cattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected
cows. In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as
coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
British officials say that the EU market will be disrupted unless all member
states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat of
unilateral action risks an EU-wide collapse in beef consumption similar to
the fall that followed the 1990 BSE scare.
A British agriculture official said: 'We feel we have a sound case and other
member states and the commission agree with us.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / Swan Hunter deal nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday they were 'very close' to a
conditional agreement to sell Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, to
French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie.
But the receivers denied a claim by Wallsend Labour MP Mr Steve Byers that
CMN had now tabled a bid for Swan Hunter.
The leader of CMN's bid team, Mr Fred Henderson, said he hoped a sale
contract would be signed in about a fortnight. 'A formal bid as such has not
been made. In the circumstances it probably never will be,' he said. 'We are
in detailed negotiation on the contract.'
The sale agreement will be conditional on Swan Hunter, which has been in
receivership since last May, winning the 18-month refit of the landing ship
Sir Bedivere. For Swans' tender to have a chance of success it must be
underwritten by a prospective purchaser.
The MoD plans to announce its decision on July 20. This poses a dilemma for
Swan Hunter because its handover on May 12 of the frigate HMS Northumberland
will leave insufficient work for the remaining 1,038 employees.
Yesterday Mr Byers and Newcastle East Labour MP Mr Nick Brown launched a
campaign to persuade the MoD to say before May 12 that it was 'minded' to
award Bedivere to Swans, subject to satisfactory detailed negotiations. They
hope this will avert 490 threatened redundancies.
They also stressed Bedivere's importance to Swans' survival. Mr Brown said:
'No Sir Bedivere, no Swan Hunter.'
Mr Henderson said an MoD announcement that it was minded to give Swans the
order would be helpful, but CMN would need final confirmation before signing
a purchase contract 'involving payment of several million pounds'. He
declined to say how much CMN planned to pay for Swan Hunter.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Lilley applauds pensions boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pensioners are now receiving far greater sums from private sources of income
than they did when the Conservatives first came to power in 1979, social
security ministers told MPs yesterday.
In a series of answers to Commons questions, Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, said pensioners were considerably better off as a result
of private-pension schemes and other forms of income.
Mr Lilley said the average pensioner's income from savings and occupational
pensions had risen some 125 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1991 to
Pounds 63.20.
Mr William Hague, a junior minister at the department, said facilities owned
by pensioners had improved sharply in recent years.
Mr Hague claimed that 90 per cent of pensioners had a television set, that
the number of pensioners with cars had doubled since 1979 and that the
percentage with the lowest 10 per cent of incomes had dropped from 31 per
cent to 11 per cent since 1979.
Both ministers were marshalling the argument about improved living standards
for pensioners ahead of an opposition-led debate on the pensions industry
later this week. Labour MPs will argue that many pensioners' incomes have
been blighted because they have been sold private pension schemes unsuitable
for them.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Councils bid for Careers Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partnerships between local education authorities and Training and Enterprise
Councils form the bulk of the 13 pathfinders for the new-look Careers
Service.
The new organisations have been formed in 13 English regions to take over
the running of the service from local authorities.
The outlets, launched by the Department of Employment yesterday, promise
'greater innovation' in helping to find young people a job. Bids to run
services in other areas of England and Wales will be invited in May.
The government hoped when it invited competitive bids for the service that
private-sector training organisations might bid.
However, in all but one case the pathfinder services will be a partnership
between Tecs, which administer government-funded training programmes in
England and Wales, and local authorities. The service in Bedfordshire is the
only one not formally to involve its local Tec.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, denied yesterday that the new
organisations were a 'repackaging' of the previous service. She said they
were designed to be more responsive to the needs of young people and
employers.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Mayhew defends Adams legal aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to give legal aid to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to
contest the order banning him from mainland Britain was defended by Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday.
Brushing aside protests, he argued that it showed the British system of
justice to be 'fair, equal and unpartisan'.
Sir Patrick said in Northern Ireland that many in the province would
consider the decision 'crazy' and it would probably not have happened in any
other part of the world. 'But it shows we do not pre-determine cases or give
assistance only to those of whom we approve.'
At question time in the Commons MPs protested that Mr Adams was being
allowed legal aid because he draws income support from the Northern Ireland
Social Security Office.
Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security secretary, said he would refer the question
to Sir Patrick, who is responsible for social security in the province.
Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the government
should follow the example of Italy, where social security was not paid to
Mafia leaders.
Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, told him: 'I am not sure I
would like to draw too far into practices in Italy in respect of the Mafia.'
It is expected that the cost of the High Court hearing could be about Pounds
50,000.
To qualify for legal aid an applicant must have a disposable income of less
than Pounds 2,294 a year. Mr Adams is officially unemployed and draws income
support.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Injuries scheme attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected calls for changes to the criminal injuries
compensation scheme, in spite of Labour's warnings that thousands of victims
would be worse off because of it.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said about a quarter of victims would
'lose substantially', and those who were losing out would often be the worst
injured.
During the report stage debate of the criminal justice and public order
bill, Mr Blair said: 'There is nothing that (more) completely exposes the
hollowness of government claims on law and order than the scrapping of the
existing system of criminal injuries compensation.'
The government is refusing to rethink the proposed changes, which would
replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff.
The reforms have been criticised in the Lords, where peers said they could
be unconstitutional and open to judicial review.
However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is understood to have taken
legal advice which supports the government view that the changes can be
implemented.
Mr Blair said the present scheme would be replaced by one 'based on a crude
tariff, which will ignore the individual circumstances of the victim'.
The existing system, introduced in 1964, compensated victims of violence on
roughly the same basis as civil law and took into account future loss of
earnings.
Mr Blair urged withdrawal of the new system until the government established
a better scheme, 'properly consulted upon, properly worked out, that
protects the interests of the victim in the way the British public wishes to
see'.
Mr Robert Maclennan, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Howard of acting
'high-handedly and possibly illegally'.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels telecoms challenge to Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has increased pressure on Bonn to stop dealing
bilaterally with the US on opening up the German telecommunications market,
by formally challenging Germany's legal compliance with the EU directive on
public procurement.
The challenge was spelled out in a letter last week to Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
German economics minister, by Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, trade and internal market commissioners.
The letter questions whether the four-year-old directive has been fully
enacted in German law and asks Mr Rexrodt for swift clarification. If there
is no satisfactory reply by early next month, Brussels will consider taking
legal action.
Economics ministry officials in Bonn said they hoped to settle amicably
their differences with the Commission. These were sparked when the US
dropped trade sanctions against Germany last month, after Bonn indicated it
would not apply Article 29 of the EU public procurement directive.
This gives European bidders for public contracts a 3 per cent price
preference and allows tenders with less than 50 per cent local content to be
ignored. The US and Germany say this is overridden by a 1954 'friendship
agreement'.
The issue coincides with signs that the fate of separate US and EU
negotiations on liberalising public procurement may hinge on talks at next
month's Gatt meeting in Marrakesh.
Stalemate persists over EU demands that the US repeal Buy American laws in
exchange for opening European telecommunications and power equipment markets
fully to US bidders. But there is growing optimism in Brussels after an
offer by Washington to raise from 24 to 36 the number of states ready to
open public procurement to international competition.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Car groups open door to foreign purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's biggest car companies committed themselves yesterday to increasing
output overseas, lifting local content of vehicles made abroad and importing
more foreign components for domestic manufacture. Three groups now have
unveiled schemes and two more are expected to do so soon.
The programmes already announced should raise imports by up to Dollars 4bn a
year by 1997. They are designed to help reduce US-Japan trade tension. The
voluntary measures follow sustained pressure from Washington on Japan to
reduce its record trade surplus. The Japanese government has insisted it was
unable to influence private sector decisions.
Toyota, Japan's biggest vehicle group, said it planned to double overseas
output by the end of 1996 from 890,000 vehicles in 1993. This would include
doubling capacity at its US plant to 400,000 units, and lifting UK capacity
from 37,000 in 1993 to 100,000 units this year.
The company said it expected to increase the value of overseas parts and
materials used by the group worldwide from Dollars 6.3bn in 1992 to Dollars
9.7bn by 1997. It also expected to raise the level of US parts from Dollars
4.43bn in the 1992 financial year to Dollars 6.45bn in 1996.
Mitsubishi said it would reduce the number of cars made in Japan for export
from 600,000 in 1993 to 550,000 in 1997. Local content of its Illinois plant
would increase from about 70 per cent currently to more than 80 per cent in
1996.
Last week Nissan announced it would increase purchases of US parts from
Dollars 3.7bn in the year to March 1995 to Dollars 4.3bn in the year to
March 1998. Similar undertakings are expected from Honda and Mazda by the
end of the week.
Japan will lift voluntary curbs on car exports to the US as of March 31, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said early today. It said: 'The
lifting of restrictions reflects recent steady declines in the number of car
exports to the US and conclusion of the Uruguay Round which decided to lift
grey restrictions within four years.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo package aims to head off trade war

<TEXT>
The Japanese government today unveils a wide-ranging package of trade
liberalisation measures intended to defuse tension in its relations with the
US.
The programme will consist of measures to stimulate domestic demand,
policies aimed at removing non-tariff import barriers, and efforts to open
the Japanese telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance and car
markets to overseas competition.
Announcement of the measures follows threats by the US to prepare for
sanctions against Japan after Tokyo refused in bilateral trade talks to
adopt numerical targets for increasing imports. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
prime minister, told US negotiators last month Japan would cut its surplus
through voluntary rather than forced measures.
Mr Hosokawa has faced severe domestic and US criticism for the failure of
the talks and is understood to be keen to demonstrate his administration can
voluntarily implement policies to reduce the trade surplus. The aim of the
macro-economic measures, details of which will be announced in June before
the Group of Seven summit, is to reduce the record current account surplus
by boosting the domestic economy and encouraging imports.
The government is thought to be aiming to cut the surplus from 3.1 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1993 to 2.8 per cent next year.
Other measures include plans to increase public works spending, beyond the
Y15,000bn (Pounds 95.5bn) already announced. The administration also intends
to extend beyond 12 months the period during which income tax cuts,
announced in February, will be implemented, in an attempt to boost consumer
spending. The policies aimed at increasing imports include deregulation,
measures to enforce competition laws more effectively, steps to promote
imports, and guidelines for improved transparency of state procurement.
The government intends to deregulate housing and land use,
telecommunications, distribution, and financial markets. The Fair Trade
Commission, the fledgling anti-monopoly watchdog, is expected to be
strengthed and its staff increased by up to 9 per cent. Import promotion
measures will include tax incentives for importers, improved customs
procedures, and more money for the Japan External Trade Organisation.
Particular attention is given to the four sectors seen as priorities by US
trade negotiators during the recent bilateral talks. Public procurement of
medical and telecommunications equipment will be more transparent and a
review mechanism will be put in place to measure past performance of foreign
groups in this sector.
The insurance market, the most tightly controlled financial sectors in
Japan, will be partly deregulated. In the car and components sectors, the
government will review the performance of overseas groups twice a year.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Coded warning to pirates - Plans to curb
counterfeit CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a trip to Dubai earlier this year, Mr Mike Edwards went shopping for
counterfeit compact discs.
Mr Edwards, operations director of the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, picked up pirate CDs by Elton John, Guns N' Roses and
Bryan Adams. He believes the counterfeiter was based in Taiwan and that the
CDs were made in China. The IFPI, along with Philips, the Dutch electronics
group, has proposed that all legitimate CD factories mark their products
with a code in an attempt to track down the pirates. The four-digit code
would tell customs officers where the CD was manufactured.
The IFPI, which represents music companies worldwide, has long complained
about pirate recordings of cassettes. Counterfeit cassettes were, however,
usually of low quality and easy to identify whereas pirate CDs are as good
as the original.
The counterfeiting of CDs has been made easier by the growth in the number
of manufacturing facilities.
The IFPI says there are 209 compact disc factories worldwide, with a
combined annual production capacity of 2bn CDs. This is twice the number of
legitimate CDs sold last year.
In China, where the IFPI believes a sizeable proportion of counterfeit
manufacturing occurs, there are 26 CD plants. Two years ago, there were
three. The US has been pressing the Chinese authorities to crack down on all
forms of commercial piracy and the IFPI says it has received assurances from
China that it will act against CD piracy.
An estimated 37.5m pirate CDs were sold worldwide in 1992, 50 per cent up on
1991 while the IFPI believes last year's increase was even bigger. Pirate
CDs generally sell at the same price as legitimate discs and the industry
estimates that it lost more than Dollars 400m in 1992 through CD piracy.
Unlike cassette pirates, who often confine their activities to their own
countries, CD counterfeiting crosses national borders. A CD pirate in one
country can order from a factory in a second and have the products shipped
to a third without ever taking physical possession of the CDs.
Mr Edwards says companies in the film, computer and publishing industries
are increasingly turning to CD technology as a vehicle for their products
and they too will fall victim to piracy.
He says: 'The CD counterfeiting problem is growing. We are sitting on a time
bomb which could stop the multimedia revolution dead in its tracks. The
record industry will not be the only casualty. Computer software, movies,
video games, books - all of these are under threat.'
The codes which the music industry hopes will limit piracy are allocated by
Philips, which holds several of the patent rights for the CD manufacturing
process. The IFPI says close to 40 factories worldwide have so far been
allocated codes known as Source Identification Codes.
The factories place the codes on the reflective inner ring on the underside
of the CD. Ms Funkazi Koroye-Crooks, an IFPI legal adviser, says the code's
position was chosen because it is difficult to place without interfering
with the other data held on the CD and it requires expertise on the part of
the manufacturer.
Each production line in a CD factory has its own code engraved on the mould
to identify the origin of the master recording and where the CD was
manufactured.
Ms Koroye-Crooks admits there is nothing to stop a factory engraving another
plant's code on its mould and that the cost of doing so is only between
Pounds 80 and Pounds 300 per mould, even though it takes some time to adapt
the production equipment.
Ms Koroye-Crooks believes it is more likely that counterfeit manufacturers
will leave the code off CDs altogether. Even plants with legitimate codes
could keep one unengraved mould for counterfeiting purposes.
For this reason, the IFPI says that the code needs to be backed by
legislative action. Ideally, this would take the form of an international
treaty sponsored by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, a United
Nations agency.
Even in the absence of such a treaty, the IFPI says the US and the European
Union could take effective action to limit CD piracy. If they were to make
it illegal to manufacture imported discs which did not carry the code, this
would close off 60 per cent of the world market to pirated CDs.

FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US adamant over worker rights talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and developing countries were yesterday on a collision course over
Washington's demand for worker rights to go on the agenda for world trade
talks.
After again failing to win support for their cause at a meeting of top trade
negotiators in Geneva, US officials said they would continue to press the
issue when ministers from over 120 nations meet next month in Marrakesh to
sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. This, many countries fear, could lead
to a full-scale row at a meeting intended to underscore harmony and set the
tone for increased global economic co-operation.
The US wants wording in the draft ministerial declaration urging the new
World Trade Organisation, which will succeed Gatt next year, to give 'early
consideration' to the relationship between 'internationally recognised
labour standards' and the world trading system.
Barring a sudden change of heart before tomorrow, when negotiators meet
formally to approve the Marrakesh documents, there will be no agreed
declaration for endorsement by ministers.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Willis limbers up for bout over Australia's budget: A look
at the open season for economic plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
April may prove to be the cruellest month for Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's
new treasurer.
Between now and early May, he must negotiate a budget which wins the backing
of two minor parties, both working to fairly radical tax and social reform
agendas, and yet keeps the Australian economy and the government's ambitious
deficit reduction plan on course.
This consultative budget process is the bequest of Mr John Dawkins, Mr
Willis' predecessor, who bowed out of political life in December. Only hours
before his unexpected resignation, the former treasurer completed a new
system bringing forward Australia's budget date from late summer to May 10
and introducing specific pre-and post-budget negotiation periods.
The Dawkins plan was a recognition of the difficulties facing Mr Paul
Keating's Labor government in the Senate. Since the government lacks an
outright majority in the upper house, it depends on the support of the Green
party, the Australian Democrats, and one independent senator to get its
measures passed.
The inherent dangers became evident last summer when the minor parties
baulked at tax proposals contained in the 1993-94 budget. For two months the
finance bills were stalled. International investors, aware that a prolonged
impasse could prompt a dissolution of parliament, took fright and the
currency fell sharply.
The new discursive approach was Mr Dawkins' way of preventing similar
debacles, and it is Mr Willis who must put the process into action. Already,
he has hit some hurdles. The minor parties prevaricated over their
participation in the process and having decided they would, they duly
presented lists of desired changes.
The Democrats want a 'tax and spend' package. Extra revenue measures would
include a minimum company tax rate of 20 per cent; a more progressive income
tax system so that those earning over ADollars 70,000 (Pounds 33,500) would
pay a marginal rate of 51 per cent and face a higher Medicare levy; and a
20.4 per cent withholding tax on interest payments.
These revenues would then fund a near ADollars 5bn increase in expenditures,
with much of the money going on social programmes - providing work for the
long-term unemployed, for example - and on infrastructure projects.
In many respects, the package dovetails with the demands of the Labor party
caucus and with those of the powerful union movement. This seems to ensure
some support within Labor's own ranks. The package also includes some
corporate 'carrots' which might appeal to smaller businesses.
The two Green senators are more radical still. They question the
desirability of pursuing economic growth at all. 'There are very strong
arguments that in high-income countries such as Australia, economic growth
does not contribute to improved quality of life,' they suggest.
This philosophical difference aside, the Greens' package has similarities
with that of the Democrats - namely, higher taxes on top earners, a
corporate tax floor, and a carbon-based energy tax.
Mr Willis, perhaps wisely, has offered only sketchy information on the
budget plans and has committed himself to little beyond his predecessor's
deficit reduction targets.
According to four-page 'fiscal framework' document which set off the
negotiation process, the aim is to have the 1994-95 deficit stand at just
under 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Priority measures will include
help for the long-term unemployed, industry and regional development and
implementation of the Native Title legislation.
Government ministers have also played down the imposition of new taxes,
although failing to rule out the possibility.
It is true that Australia's strong economic performance in the last quarter
of 1993 would seem to provide Mr Willis with some latitude. But government
critics note significant lingering weaknesses. The 4 per cent GDP growth
last year was largely due to an uptick in personal consumption, the
continuing surge in housing expenditure, and a strong export performance.
Business investment, by contrast, was flat in the final quarter and down by
more than 12 per cent year-on-year.
With the need to ensure that growth picks up steadily and does not result in
a sudden import surge, the treasurer cannot afford measures which risk
either price stability or the low interest rate regime.
The big question, then, is how hard the minor parties will push the demands
 -and what sticks the government can wield to keep their demands in check.
Already, Mr Keating has lashed out at the 'unrepresentative' nature of the
Senate, and talked of changing the system by which senators are elected. (It
is currently a proportional representation system based on the country's
individual states.).
Such a move would be highly contentious, particularly since the Democrats
are generally judged to have used their marginal power astutely. But such
threats intensify pressure on the minor parties. It is heady mixture of
bluff and bluster, and is likely to dominate Canberra for several months.

<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's embattled prime minister, ended a series of
political reverses yesterday after his coalition squeaked to a local poll
victory, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
In Sunday's poll for governor of Ishikawa Prefecture, the coalition
candidate narrowly defeated the opposition Liberal Democratic party by about
1.6 per cent. The triumph in the north-western coastal province was expected
to fuel Mr Hosokawa's drive to bring together the seven disparate parties
into one reformist group to keep the LDP out of power.
It was the first local poll to pit the combined parties in the coalition
against the LDP since last July's general election brought Mr Hosokawa to
power and pushed the LDP out of government for the first time in nearly four
decades.
'This election was a choice of whether or not to drive ahead reforms under
the coalition government,' Mr Hosokawa said. 'Voters made a clear choice. We
shall forge ahead with reform and strengthen the coalition's unity.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / Japan steel output set to hit 23-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's crude steel output, a leading indicator of industrial activity, is
expected to hit a 23-year low for the April-June quarter, reflecting weak
exports and sluggish demand from manufacturers and the construction
industry.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast output for the
first quarter of the next business year, at 22.4m tonnes, the lowest since
1971. The figure is down 14.7 per cent from the previous year and down 0.1
per cent from the preceding quarter.
The gloomy estimates follow the recent spate of strong economic data which
many private economists believe indicates the country's economy has hit
bottom.
'All the good stories are overdone,' Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at
brokers Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo, said. He predicted economic
figures to be announced during May and June were likely to reflect a still
sluggish economy.
The ministry said crude steel production for the year ending March 31 would
fall below 100m tonnes for the second consecutive year to an estimated 97m
tonnes, down 1.9 per cent from the previous year.
However, analysts expecting a recovery this year led by consumer spending
were comforted by household spending figures for January announced
yesterday.
These indicated a year-on-year rise for the fourth consecutive month.
According to the Management and Co-ordination Agency, household spending in
January increased 2.7 per cent in real terms from a year earlier.
Spending by salaried workers grew a net 0.6 per cent for the first time in
nine months, while spending by households of the self-employed surged 6 per
cent.
Expenditure on education rose 16.9 per cent and housing spending rose 14.2
per cent; medical-care spending fell 3 per cent.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Beijing agrees industrial pact with S Koreans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea and China yesterday agreed to co-operate in the development and
production of cars, aircraft, telecommunications equipment and
high-definition television under an industrial pact signed during President
Kim Young-sam's visit to Beijing.
South Korea has been eagerly seeking Chinese economic co-operation,
believing that China's abundant and cheap labour, natural resources and
technology complement Korea's strengths in finance and production methods.
The combined resources of the two nations 'will produce great results,' Mr
Kim said.
Korean officials believe industrial links will help open up the large
Chinese market to Korean products and gain Chinese support for the marketing
of jointly produced high-technology products in other developing countries.
A main area of co-operation will be the aircraft sector. Seoul plans to
finance the development of a 100-seat airliner by the year 2000 that will
use Chinese aerospace technology, which is considered more advanced than
Korea's. Samsung and Daewoo have already signed preliminary agreements with
Aviation Industries of China.
The aircraft project is to take advantage of an expected increase in demand
for regional airliners in the two countries in the next decade.
The agreement on car production will open the way for Korea's three main
motor companies - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - to establish joint venture
production facilities in China within two to three years.
The Korean car companies view China as an inexpensive manufacturing site and
a potentially large market for vehicles. Korean carmakers will initially
have to produce automotive parts with Chinese partners before being
permitted to assemble vehicles.
In telecommunications, South Korea will adapt versions of its TDX automatic
telephone exchange system for both rural and urban networks in China.
The two nations also plan joint development of HDTV, facsimile machines and
large colour television sets.
Co-operation in the four technology sectors will be supervised by a new
bilateral industrial committee, which may eventually promote links in other
areas, such as nuclear power generation and satellite development.
South Korea is also seeking orders from China's ambitious infrastructure
project; it promised Dollars 40m (Pounds 27.3m) in economic aid for the
programme. Korean companies are hoping to win construction orders for
electric power facilities and also plan to manage and operate existing
nuclear power plants in China.
President Kim asked China to improve laws to protect foreign investment,
which has been a source of concern for Korean manufacturers.
The German airline Lufthansa said yesterday it would train 76 Chinese air
force pilots at its flying school in the US to become commercial pilots,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The Chinese pilots will join Air China, one of seven regional airlines that
emerged from the breakup of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
Demand for air travel in China is so great that the country needs to train
thousands of new pilots in the next few years.
It has one of the world's worst air safety records.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Israelis shoot dead six Fatah activists: Deaths cast shadow
on Hebron security talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In the bloodiest single incident since last month's Hebron mosque massacre,
Israeli undercover troops shot dead six Palestinians and seriously injured a
seventh in Gaza's Jebalya refugee camp yesterday.
The dead men were identified by local residents as members of Mr Yassir
Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO, and their deaths cast a shadow
over today's scheduled resumption of talks in Cairo between Israeli and PLO
delegations trying to agree on protective measures for the Palestinians of
Hebron. Last week, the Israeli army's killing of four Hamas Islamic
militants in Hebron almost forced a suspension of the talks, and it seems
likely that Mr Arafat would be more sensitive to the deaths of his own
loyalists.
Yesterday's incident occurred shortly after PLO supporters had held a
memorial ceremony in Gaza's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood for a Fatah activist
killed a month ago by the Israeli army. Two carloads of Fatah supporters
were returning to Jebalya when, according to Israeli military sources, they
were spotted by undercover troops and ordered to halt. The army claimed the
Fatah men ignored the order and fired on the soldiers, who shot back.
Three Palestinian youths standing near the cars were also slightly hurt. The
army claimed the dead men were found to have been armed, but witnesses
denied this and said they were simply handing out leaflets to passers-by
through the car windows. State television said last night that the army had
closed off the immediate area, and was considering placing much of Gaza
under curfew.
Israeli and Palestinian officials could seal agreement by today on security
measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, they said yesterday. This should
lead to the immediate resumption of suspended talks on Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza and Jericho.
Mr Nabill Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the two sides had 'gone a long
and important way' in the talks and only 'some points' remained at issue.
PLO officials in Tunis said the differences were over the precise number of
international observers and Palestinian police to be deployed in Hebron, and
some details of their jurisdiction and rules of deployment.
The Israelis want to limit the observer force to 60 officers, to be supplied
by Norway, and the Palestinian force to a few dozen. The PLO is seeking 150
observers and 400 police. Mr Shaath said the PLO was awaiting responses to
its demands from Israel. 'We are not going to discuss anything else until we
finish this agreement,' he added.
Both sides appear eager to return to full peace talks as soon as possible.
However, while PLO officials in Tunis said they still hoped Israeli
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho could begin as scheduled on April 13,
Israeli officials have suggested the talks might need 'a few weeks' to
conclude agreement.

A meeting intended as a summit to discuss the uncertain future of the Group
of 15 developing countries got off to a bad start yesterday, when only six
heads of government turned up, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
The G15 opened three-day talks aimed at reviving dialogue on economic and
political co-operation, without leaders from several Latin American nations
there, officials said.
The conference had been billed as a summit of the five-year-old grouping,
which needed 10 heads of government to make a quorum. But only five leaders,
from Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Malaysia and Indonesia arrived to join
India's Premier PV Narasimha Rao.
Absent were heads of state from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Mexico,
Peru, Venezuela, Algeria and Egypt. Those countries not represented by
leaders will have their foreign ministers present for what one official
called 'a crucial meeting in the sense that G15 must decide its own future'.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Singapore PM eases Burma's isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Goh Chok Tong, prime minister of Singapore, arrived in Burma yesterday
for a rare visit to the country by the head of a foreign government. It will
bolster the fortunes of the military junta while antagonising Burmese
opposition groups and western human rights activists.
Mr Goh, accompanied by two dozen businessmen, is the first head of
government - apart from the prime minister of Laos - to visit Burma since
the armed forces crushed a pro-democracy uprising and killed hundreds of
demonstrators in 1988.
Singapore is one of the main foreign investors in Burma. It sells weapons to
the junta and has taken the lead in seeking improved contacts between Burma
and the rest of south-east Asia. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is expected
to be invited by Thailand to attend July's meeting of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (Asean) in Bangkok.
The Singapore prime minister's visit is 'to promote Myanmar-Singapore
relations in the context of Asean's policy of constructive engagement with
Myanmar,' Mr Goh's office said.
The US administration wants to put pressure on Burma's generals to begin
negotiations with Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained opposition leader, and
is planning to ask arms exporters to stop supplying weapons to Burma.
Singapore would be unwilling to comply with the request. As well as selling
weapons, Singaporean companies give advice on small arms manufacturing and
use Burmese territory to test their military products, according to
residents of Rangoon.
Asian governments say that investment in Burma and dialogue with the junta
will help the Burmese people, whereas isolation would only harden the
attitudes of the regime: after years of stagnation, the economy is now
growing by about 5 per cent annually.
Opposition leaders, however, resent the close ties between the Burmese,
Singaporean, Thai and other governments.
'Constructive engagement is not constructive,' said one politician from Ms
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party in Rangoon recently. 'It's
destructive opportunism. We are in a time of trouble, and when the
government is oppressing its own people, they shouldn't do it.'

Israeli and Palestinian officials could seal agreement by today on security
measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, they said yesterday. This should
lead to the immediate resumption of suspended talks on Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza and Jericho.
Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israeli officials are due to meet in
Cairo to resume talks on security in Hebron interrupted last Friday for the
Jewish Passover. Both sides indicated they were near agreement on
implementing UN Resolution 904 which calls for international observers in
Hebron and early deployment of Palestinian police in the West Bank town.
Mr Nabill Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the two sides had 'gone a long
and important way' in the talks and only 'some points' remained at issue.
PLO officials in Tunis said the differences were over the precise number of
international observers and Palestinian police to be deployed in Hebron, and
some details of their jurisdiction and rules of deployment.
The Israelis want to limit the observer force to 60 officers, to be supplied
by Norway, and the Palestinian force to a few dozen. The PLO is seeking 150
observers and 400 police. Mr Shaath said the PLO was awaiting responses to
its demands from Israel. 'We are not going to discuss anything else until we
finish this agreement,' he added.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he expected agreement on the
outstanding issues to be reached today; the two delegations could as soon as
tomorrow resume full talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.
These talks were suspended by the PLO after the massacre in Hebron of more
than 30 Palestinian worshippers on February 25.
Both sides are eager to return to full peace talks as soon as possible, and
conclude implementation talks on the deal agreed last year in Washington.
While PLO officials in Tunis said they still hoped Israeli withdrawal from
Gaza and Jericho could begin as scheduled on April 13, Israeli officials
have suggested the talks might need 'a few weeks' to conclude agreement.
Mr Mustapha Natsche, Hebron's former mayor, reiterated Palestinian demands
for the removal of 400 Jewish settlers from the town-centre, calling their
withdrawal the 'ideal solution'. Other Palestinian leaders in the town sent
a message to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, urging him to refrain from
resuming talks with the Israelis until and unless the settlers were removed.
Mr Peres and most of his cabinet colleagues have indicated they would back
such a removal. Mr Peres said on Sunday night that 'co-existence in Hebron
is an impossibility'. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, remains
implacably opposed to any such action. Hebron was relatively quiet
yesterday, two days after the army lifted a curfew in the town. Only minor
clashes were reported between Palestinians and Israeli troops.

FT  29 MAR 94 / S Africa unveils steps to keep fiscal discipline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa yesterday unveiled temporary measures aimed at maintaining
fiscal discipline in the country's public finances until a new government
can draw up a budget after next month's first all-race elections.
The measures seek to maintain the course set by the 1992-93 budget as well
as meeting the fiscal and monetary policy requirements to which the
multiparty Transitional Executive Council (TEC) agreed in a letter of intent
it signed as a prerequisite for obtaining a Dollars 850m (Pounds 579m) loan
from the International Monetary Fund in late 1993.
In a demonstration of the co-operation in South Africa's transition to
democracy, the TEC and the Department of Finance unveiled the measures
jointly. In the past, the annual budget had been presented to parliament in
mid-March.
No new date has been set, but the 1994-95 budget is likely to be promulgated
by a newly elected national assembly several months into the current fiscal
year.
The TEC has decided to use existing legislation which allows government
departments to spend 45 per cent of the previous year's budget allocation in
the first four months of the new fiscal year, and 10 per cent a month
thereafter up to a ceiling equal to the previous year's allocation.
Mr Estian Calitz, director-general of the Department of Finance, said this
mechanism allowed for redistribution of expenditure within departments as
long as overall government spending did not exceed these limits.
Total government spending is projected to rise by 8.3 per cent to R124.8bn
(Pounds 24bn) in 1994-95 from R115.2bn the previous year, a small decline in
real terms.
South Africa's inflation rate averaged 9.7 per cent in calendar 1993; latest
figures released yesterday showed the February figure unchanged from
January's 9.9 per cent.
Revenue was projected to climb faster to R98.7bn from R90.1bn, to produce a
lower deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product of 6.4 per cent,
against 6.8 per cent in 1992-93.
Considering the projections were based on an unchanged tax regime and
included estimates of one-off costs such as financing the election, the
'underlying deficit' was closer to the 6 per cent target identified in the
letter of intent to the IMF, Mr Calitz stressed.
Mr Tito Mboweni, African National Congress representative on the TEC's
finance sub-council, said the presentation of budgetary guidelines and a
fiscal overview of the economy 'underscored the management of the transition
process'.
The presentation was made to the National Economic Forum, representing
government, business and organised labour, as well as representatives of
local financial institutions.
'A balance has had to be found between two imperatives,' Mr Mboweni said.
The transitional administration had to ensure continuity of services and
sound fiscal management through the interim period, while taking into
account the 'new policies and priorities' a new government would want to
address in its first budget.

Gunmen opened fire on several thousand Zulus marching in central
Johannesburg yesterday, turning the South African commercial capital into a
bloodbath, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Police said 18 people, including two policemen, were killed and up to 25
wounded in the attack.
Mr Carl Niehaus, African National Congress spokesman, said ANC security
guards had fired at 'gunmen' to disperse them as the Zulus marched past the
ANC headquarters at Shell House in a protest against next month's all-race
elections. 'Several gunmen tried to gain access to the building,' he said.
The ANC security guards fired warning shots into the air before shooting to
disperse the crowd, he added. Police sealed off the building.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, later said the government might have to
declare a state of emergency to ensure South Africa's first all-race
elections went ahead next month.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Sri Lanka poll snub for ruling party

<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's ruling United National party has been thrown into turmoil by its
first big electoral defeat in 17 years.
The party, which is preparing for a presidential election later this year
and a general election in early 1995, was heavily defeated late last week in
provincial council polls in the island's southern province. The party won
just 23 seats, against 32 for the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom party led by
Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The result was widely seen in Colombo as a vote against the policies of
President D B Wijetunga, who took power last year after the assassination of
President Ranasinge Premadasa. Mr Wijetunga has championed a hard-line
approach to the Tamil Tigers, separatist guerrillas in the north of the
island who want to create an independent homeland for the country's Tamil
minority.
The pursuit of the Tigers suffered a setback last November when the
militants stormed an army base in the north, killing at least 200 soldiers
and capturing much valuable equipment.
While Mr Premadasa also pursued the Tamil Tigers vigorously, he softened his
attack with a broad-based political appeal to moderate Tamils and to other
minorities, including Moslems and tea plantation workers of Indian Tamil
origin. A populist at heart, he used poverty-alleviation and public housing
programmes to help win hearts - and votes.
Unlike Mr Premadasa, who came from a poor background, Mr Wijetunga comes
from an elite social group - the Kandyans. He has adopted a more
condescending attitude to the minorities, saying they must regard the
Sinhala majority as 'the great tree' on which other communities hang like
'creepers'.
Mr Wijetunga has also been less assiduous in cultivating Mr S Thondaman, the
only Tamil minister and a powerful trade unionist, whom Mr Premadasa made a
point of favouring.
Mr Premadasa's popularity enabled the government to push through an economic
restructuring programme supported by the IMF, which included privatisation
and austerity measures. The poll defeat may lead Mr Wijentunga to adopt more
popular economic policies, possibly including spending increases.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Colosio plot rumours growin Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation is mounting in the Mexican press that last week's murder of
leading presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio was planned by
subversive organisations or even hard-line members of his own party.
'Colosio, victim of a plot' was the front page headline in yesterday's El
Universal newspaper. The newspaper offered little in the way of conclusive
evidence to support the story.
El Universal based its headline on reports, confirmed by the Attorney
General's office, that Mr Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, a security guard
hired by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party in Tijuana, the scene
of the murder, had been detained for questioning. Mr Sanchez was held after
photographs appeared indicating he might have helped the assassin gain
access to Mr Colosio.
The photographs are anything but conclusive. The report, along with
suggestions Mr Colosio may have been shot with two guns, and not with one as
the attorney-general has reported, were enough to spark off a new round of
rumours. El Universal usually supports the government.
A government official denied Mr Colosio was killed by more than one person,
and said scores of witnesses believed there had been just one assassin. The
Attorney General's office said Mr Sanchez had no link with official security
for Mr Colosio and was hired by local PRI officials to control crowds.
Mexico has been awash with rumours that Mr Colosio was murdered by his
enemies or those who stood to gain from his removal ever since Wednesday's
assassination. Evidence to support the conspiracy theory is thin, but
widespread lack of trust in the government and police has allowed the
rumours to gain currency.
One theory is Mr Mario Aburto, Mr Colosio's confessed assassin, is linked to
subversive groups. Ms Graciel Gonzalez, Mr Aburto's 16-year-old girlfriend,
told authorities, according to El Universal, that Mr Aburto had spent
several weeks in the southern state of Chiapas before and after the New Year
armed uprising there, and was sympathetic to the Zapatista rebels.
An alternative view, subscribed to by the Zapatistas, is that the murder was
planned by so-called dinosaurs (hard-liners against democratic reforms) in
the PRI who oppose the reformist wing in the party represented by Mr
Colosio.

<TEXT>
A series of tornadoes and violent thunderstorms that ripped through five
southern states killed at least 44 people, injured more than 350 and damaged
scores of rural communities, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Atlanta.
The governors of Alabama and Georgia are expected to call on the federal
government for economic assistance for the hardest-hit areas, where many
residents who lost their homes are poor and have no insurance.
The worst death toll was in the north-east Alabama town of Piedmont, where a
tornado slammed into the Goshen United Methodist Church during a Palm Sunday
service, devastating the brick structure with about 140 worshippers inside.
Authorities said 20 people died from injuries received when the church's
roof collapsed.
Police reported two other deaths in Alabama, including a woman who died
along the Coosa River near the town of Ragland, where a tornado destroyed
several houses and mobile homes and severely damaged another church.
Another 18 people died in Georgia and more than 200 were injured in severe
storms and tornadoes which blasted several rural communities on Sunday
afternoon.
Six members of one Georgia family died in when a funnel cloud swept up their
mobile home and catapulted it 30 feet.
By yesterday morning an estimated 7,000 people were still without power in
northern sections of the state. Thirteen shelters had been opened for the
homeless, while workers struggled with power lines and washed-out roads.

The president of Argentina's securities commission has refused to accept
government demands he resign after criticising a proposal by the US
investment banks CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch to handle share sales for
the country's pensioners.
Mr Martin Redrado, president of the CNV securities commission, said a
proposal by the two companies to sell an estimated Dollars 720m worth of
shares in YPF, the privatised oil company, was against the interests of the
pensioners. 'I am not resigning,' Mr Redrado said yesterday. 'I am defending
disclosure and protecting investors and the independence a regulator needs
to have in a credible market.'
His tenure is guaranteed by law until 1996, he said and challenged the
government to remove him. Charges proposed by the two banks, 3.75 per cent
commission plus a 50 cent discount on the YPF share price in New York, were
excessive, Mr Redrado declared. He demanded the pensioners be offered a
better deal.
An economy ministry official said: 'Someone who does not agree with the
government's policies should leave.' Neither First Boston nor Merrill Lynch
would comment on the issue.
Merrill Lynch and First Boston underwrote the Dollars 3.04bn sale of 45 per
cent of YPF in last year's privatisation.

FT  29 MAR 94 / California defiant in unitary tax case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
California has a perfect constitutional right to reimpose unitary taxation
tomorrow, the state's lawyers told the US Supreme Court yesterday as they
defended their use of the controversial tax assessment method against
Barclays Bank of the UK.
'Politically, would that happen? Probably not, but what we are dealing with
is a political question,' said Mr Timothy Laddish, California's assistant
attorney general.
Under pressure from the Clinton administration, California's legislature
last year stopped imposing its unitary tax system, which calculated tax on a
proportion of a group's worldwide income, rather than just on income earned
in the state.
The case revolves around a contested tax assessment of Dollars 154,000, but
interest and associated cases have raised the stakes for California to a
total of Dollars 800m.
In the Supreme Court yesterday, Mr Drew Days, the Clinton administration's
solicitor general, argued unitary taxation might have become
unconstitutional after 1985, because it conflicted with administration
policy and thus prevented the federal government from speaking with one
voice. But Mr Days said that in 1977, the year at issue in the case brought
by Barclays against California, the government had expressed 'a preference,
and not a policy'.
Although Mr Days's arguments were meant to support California, Mr Laddish
said that he was wrong: the unitary method was not only a 'user-friendly
system of reasonable apportionment', it remained constitutional, because
Congress had quite clearly refused to outlaw it.
Judging by their questions yesterday - an uncertain indication of voting
intentions - two of the nine Supreme Court justices appeared to incline
towards Barclays, while four seemed to favour California.

<TEXT>
Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, yesterday attempted to quell
Japanese anxiety over the shooting of two Japanese college students in a Los
Angeles suburb over the weekend. The two died on Sunday.
Mr Takuma Ito and Mr Go Matsuura, a Japanese American, were each shot in the
head by a gunman during a car hijacking outside a supermarket last Friday.
The shootings, the latest incidents of violence involving Japanese in the
US, have sparked a public outcry in Japan. In October 1992 a 16-year-old
exchange student was shot dead after going to the wrong house looking for a
Hallowe'en party.
Over 3m Japanese travel to the US every year, including 50,000 who go there
to study in American schools. Mr Mondale said he hoped the incident would
not discourage Japanese from visiting the US.
'Most everyone lives a safe and fulfilling life in the United States and are
untouched by such horrible criminal behaviour.'
He said the recent killings were tragic from every standpoint, including the
fact that they gave an 'entirely distorted picture of life in the US,'
adding that violent incidents had never happened to him although he had
lived and travelled extensively around the country.

Merrill Lynch and First Boston underwrote the Dollars 3.04bn sale of 45 per

As part of the privatisation, pensioners were offered an option of swapping
government bonds into YPF stock but were required to retain the shares for
at least one year.
About 96,000 pensioners hold 30m YPF shares with a market value of Dollars
720m. As part the privatisation, Merrill Lynch and First Boston retain the
right of first refusal in handling the transaction.
The Redrado affair has come as a great embarrassment for the government.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US space officials breathed a sigh of relief when Congress last year spared
the life of the space station by a single vote.
Their hopes that the vote would be the last hurdle for the redesigned
station are, however, turning out to have been premature.
Fitting the space station into the overall budget of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is once again proving to be a hard
task.
The Congressional Budget Office, Congress's independent fiscal watchdog,
warned last week that Nasa faces certain failure in its efforts to fund the
space station within a budget that has been trimmed to Dollars 14.3bn for
next fiscal year and is scheduled to stay below Dollars 14.6bn until the end
of the century.
'The attempt to fit a programme that was projected to cost more than Dollars
20bn a year in the late 1990s into an annual budget of Dollars 14bn risks
delay, mission failure and the loss of anticipated benefits,' the budget
office said.
The office suggested that Nasa could live on a Dollars 14.3bn budget if it
concentrated only on manned space flight, including the space station and
planning for eventual piloted missions to the moon and Mars.
That would mean slashing back astronomy and physics missions, including the
Hubble space telescope and the planned Earth Observation System.
Alternatively, the budget office suggested an Dollars 11bn-a-year programme
that would still conduct four shuttle flights a year, but concentrate on
robot missions, eliminating the space station and moon projects.
Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa's head, slammed the budget office report as
'defeatist,' saying it would destroy the essential balance between space
flight, science and aeronautics in the agency's missions.
But even some staunch Nasa supporters in Congress have been pushed to the
brink.
Congressman George Brown of California, chairman of the House of
Representatives science, space and technology committee, warned that the
space programme was 'in serious trouble'.
He warned that if Nasa's budget were cut any further below the Dollars
14.3bn sought by the administration, he would be compelled to vote against
the space station.
Mr Brown is also concerned that the new space station plans may depend too
much on a contribution from Russia.
'I'm in favour of co-operating with the Russians. But I don't favour
co-operating with them to the extent that they could endanger the whole
project by failing to meet their commitments,' he said.
European partners in the space station, meanwhile, are extremely hesitant
about committing more resources to the project, because of the repeated
changes in US plans.
'European confidence in the US-led space station is at an all-time low,'
Congressman James Sensenbrenner, the senior Republican spokesman on space
issues, said after a tour of European space centres.

<TEXT>
The Swedish Medical Association last night called off a series of strikes
that had hit hospital services in many parts of the country over the past
three weeks following an agreement with the local authorities which control
the state health service. The settlement was based on a two-year pay deal
giving the doctors a 3 per cent pay rise, but subtracting two days of
holiday. Another parallel dispute over the introduction of a new system for
administering family doctors has been sidelined by a row in parliament which
may halt the reform.
Opposition to joining the EU has strengthened in Sweden since it signed the
accession accord with Brussels. A poll for the business newspaper Dagens
Industri showed opposition growing by two percentage points since February
to 54 per cent, while support for membership slipped by the same margin to
46 per cent.

An official suggestion that Coca-Cola might sponsor the celebrations of the
20th anniversary of Portugal's 'Revolution of the Flowers' has plunged the
country into an emotional debate on the brand name's symbolism. Banned for
half a century by the right-wing dictator Antonio de Salazar as 'a drug',
Coca-Cola is seen by many as an apt symbol of the end of Portugal's
international isolation and its return to the fold of western democracy. But
the young left-wing army officers who led the revolution in April, 1974,
themselves scorned the drink as 'the dirty water of imperialism' and now
lament the idea that their socialist-inspired revolt should be associated
with what they see as a leading symbol of capitalism.

Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement yesterday giving Moscow
a 20-year lease on the Baikonur cosmodrome, the space launchpad that became
part of the republic of Kazakhstan when the Soviet Union split up two years
ago.
The agreement, signed in Moscow with the Kazakhstan president, Mr Nursultan
Nazarbayev, represented a settlement of what had become among the most
contentious issues separating Russia and the central Asian republic.
Moscow had sought up to a 99-year lease on the prestigious Baikonur, the
600-sq-mile site from which Russia has launched all its manned flights since
Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space in 1961. But Kazakhstan sought a
shorter commitment because it wants to operate the site itself once it is
technically and economically capable. The deal includes a clause allowing
the lease to be extended by 10 years.

FT  29 MAR 94 / France wins new EU parliament

France is set to win its battle to build a new chamber for the European
parliament in Strasbourg. An agreement is expected to be endorsed this week
by the Strasbourg city council and the parliament's bureau, ending a dispute
which threatened to disrupt the Euro-elections in June.
The French government had blocked an agreed increase in the number of MEPs
from 518 to 567, mainly to take account of German unification, until the
parliament signed a lease on a new building in Strasbourg. The tactic upset
the Bonn government, but Paris was worried that the parliament, the only
European Union institution on French soil, was gradually drifting away to
Brussels, the site for the European Commission and the council of ministers.
Critics argue that the proposed building, which could cost up to Dollars
500m (Pounds 342.4m), is redundant. MEPs have only just moved into an
expensive new home in Brussels, and most would prefer to work in the Belgian
capital rather than commute once a month to Strasbourg. The new building
will be financed by state and city-backed loans, with the parliament
reimbursing the bulk of the money in rent over 20 years.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Bulgaria closer to debt reduction pact: EU backing has
cleared the way for more reform funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria is moving closer to finalising a debt reduction agreement with
western creditors following last week's decision by the European Union to
grant the country Dollars 175m (Pounds 120m) in balance of payments support.
This has given the government a chance to push ahead both with economic
reform and settlement of its Dollars 9.3bn foreign debt.
The EU loan agreement means that Bulgaria now has the financial backing
needed to meet a June 30 deadline for rescheduling its debt to 300 London
Club commercial banks.
Other Group of 24 countries are expected to agree a further Dollars 150m in
aid at a meeting in Brussels this week. This will enable the International
Monetary Fund to go ahead with a much-delayed Dollars 400m loan package.
An IMF standby agreement will, in turn, unlock Dollars 200m in linked World
Bank and Japanese funding. The IMF and World Bank are also considering
further loans of Dollars 225m if the debt rescheduling deal goes through.
With central bank reserves down to around Dollars 600m, foreign financing is
essential if Bulgaria is to make an initial payment of Dollars 850m on its
debt to the London Club. This was promised in the framework agreement
reached last November when the banks, chaired by Deutsche Bank, agreed to
halve the Dollars 9.3bn debt racked up by Bulgaria's former communist regime
in the 1980s. Final terms are to be agreed by June.
As with Poland, which reached a London Club agreement earlier this month,
settlement of the debt is vital if Bulgaria is to complete its transition to
a market economy and take full advantage of the EU association agreement
signed last year.
Since March 1990, when Bulgaria unilaterally declared a debt moratorium, the
country has been cut off from western commercial financing. Foreign
investment totalled only Dollars 220m by the end of 1993, a fraction of that
in other former Soviet bloc states. As a result the government in Sofia has
been dependent on international institutions, such as the IMF, World Bank
and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The onus is now on Sofia to follow through with its pledges to the IMF and
World Bank to speed up reform and keep the debt negotiations on track.
Parliament has already passed a tough budget which limits the 1994 deficit
to 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product.
However, to reach this deficit target the government needs to improve tax
collection and successfully implement a new 18 per cent value added tax
which is being introduced on April 1.
A shortfall in tax revenues contributed to a budget deficit of 11 per cent
of GDP last year.
The government has also taken steps to refinance Dollars 2.4bn of bad loans
to state enterprises made by banks before 1991. Earlier this month, it
issued its first bonds to convert enterprise debt into government debt.
The aim is to make companies easier to privatise and strengthen the banking
system. But IMF and World Bank officials in Sofia say greater political will
is needed to move ahead with reform and speed up the pace of privatisation
and restructuring.
The country is still without a bankruptcy law and only a few, mainly small
companies, have been closed down.
Officials fear that unless financial discipline in the enterprise sector is
tightened, state companies will continue to run up debts to banks and to
each other. Privatisation has been equally slow. Two years after the passing
of a privatisation law which envisaged the sale of more than 3,000
companies, the agency responsible for selling medium-sized and large
companies has completed less than 20 transactions and ministries have sold
only 200 small businesses.
A mass privatisation scheme, conceived 10 months ago to relaunch the process
and widen the population's participation in privatisation, has not got past
a second reading in parliament. Western advisers say there is still no
consensus over technical details of the scheme within the government which
is a weak, non-partisan coalition backed by the Bulgarian Socialist party,
the former communist party and the small ethnic Turk party.
The lack of consensus is in part due to conflicts over reform between
conservatives and economic liberals in the government and in the BSP.
It is also widely believed that powerful members of the former communist
nomenklatura are blocking privatisation while they strip state companies of
their valuable assets and position themselves to benefit personally from
privatisation.
The government's political weakness has been exacerbated by the poor health
of Mr Lyuben Berov, the prime minister and architect of the mass
privatisation scheme.
Mr Berov, 68, underwent emergency heart surgery two weeks ago and is
unlikely to return to work for several weeks, if at all.
The fear is that his illness will cause a political crisis and trigger early
elections which would further delay economic reform.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in Germany has fallen to its lowest level since May 1991,
according to preliminary data released by the federal statistics office
showing a monthly increase of 0.2 per cent for March. Inflation in the 12
months to March was 3.2 per cent, a drop of 0.2 percentage points compared
with the rate in the 12 months to February. The preliminary figure is based
on results from the four most populous Lander. Final figures are not
expected until mid-April. The March increase is in line with forecasts of
falling inflation and comes two weeks after Mr Hans Tietmayer, the
Bundesbank president, said inflation was set to fall below 2 per cent in the
long term. The government has forecast inflation of about 3 per cent for
1994. Analysts said the March rise was mainly caused by increased taxes on
fuel, although the higher cost of rents and services also contributed to the
rise.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Balkans leaders visit London
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Zhelyu Zhelev, the Bulgarian president and Mr Sali Berisha, the president
of Albania, today hold separate talks in London with Mr John Major, the
British prime minister and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, writes
Anthony Robinson.
The Balkan situation, and ways of preventing the Yugoslav imbroglio spilling
over into a wider Balkan war will be high on the agenda. Bulgaria has been
particularly hard hit by the UN trade embargo on Serbia and the difficulty
of ensuring transit rights needed for access to western markets. Both
countries are concerned about the the fate of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and
ethnic tensions in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which in the
past have led to conflicts involving both Greece and Turkey as well as
Bulgaria.
Both presidents will also seek to drum up the interest of UK investors at
separate conferences organised by the Confederation of British industry and
will give details of their economic reform and foreign policies in talks at
the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Last week Rover, recently
taken over by BMW, announced a car and van assembly plant investment in
Bulgaria, which is a growing exporter of wine to the UK.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Local polls set to strengthen Ciller: A strong law and order
platform appears to have paid off for Turkey's beleaguered premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's embattled prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, appeared to have
strengthened her position yesterday, as her centre-right True Path party
(DYP) headed for a narrow victory in nationwide local elections - but the
Moslem-backed Refah party was poised for sweeping gains.
Last night, with about three quarters of the votes counted for the
provincial assemblies, the DYP was leading with 22.6 per cent of the vote,
compared with 21 per cent for the conservative Motherland party (Anap).
However, in a shock result, the pro-Islamic Refah, with 18 per cent of the
vote nationally, seemed poised to win Istanbul, the largest city, and was
running neck-and-neck for control of the capital, Ankara. Feeding on
disaffection with the mainstream parties in the two main cities, Refah had
polled 25 per cent of the vote in Istanbul compared with Anap's 22 per cent.
In Ankara, Refah was competing for victory against the secularist Social
Democratic Populist party (SHP).
The national result, while having no direct bearing on party strengths in
parliament, will provide Mrs Ciller with a badly needed electoral mandate.
The outcome is a particular blow to the political ambitions of Anap's
leader, Mr Mesut Yilmaz, who billed the elections as a referendum on the
government's performance. Despite almost universal criticism of her economic
policies, yesterday's polls suggest the rural voter still believes Mrs
Ciller is the best hope for national revival.
The result strengthens her hand on reform as her coalition partners, the
Social Democratic Populists, who have been routinely obstructive on tax and
privatisation moves, suffered widespread losses, winning around 13 per cent.
However, Mrs Ciller has only won herself a breathing space, and still has to
convince the market she can assemble a team and administer spending
restraints and other economic reforms to narrow the fiscal deficit and
restore confidence in the currency. She met her key economic advisers for
four hours earlier in the day, and last night was said to be finalising
details of reforms.
In the end, what probably clinched the result was Mrs Ciller's decision to
fight on a strong law and order platform - particularly her legal moves
against Kurdish MPs. This appears to have been strongly endorsed in rural
Anatolia and the Aegean region where the DYP is traditionally strong. The
military, which is preparing for its long heralded spring offensive against
rebel positions, will also take comfort from the vote which would appear to
back up the security forces' hard line against the Kurds, despite the
international criticism. Another notable element in the results was the
Refah party's strong showing in Kurdish areas.
The markets welcomed the results yesterday, with the lira steadier at around
24,900 to the dollar.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Olivetti bid wins Italian telecoms licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government last night awarded the hotly contested licence for
its new Europe-wide GSM standard mobile telecommunications network to a
consortium led by the Olivetti computer group.
The contract was awarded to the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium on the eve
of the country's general election results. The losing consortium was Unitel,
a joint venture led by Fiat and including Fininvest, the holding company of
media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, Vodafone and BellSouth.
The decision had been pending for several days but the timing of the Ciampi
government's decision appeared linked to the likelihood of Mr Berlusconi's
Forza Italia movement being on the winning side in the elections.
Omnitel-Pronto Italia won on technical grounds and by virtue of the higher
fee that will be paid to the government - L750bn (Pounds 304m).
The licence to run Italy's second mobile phones network, in competition with
the Sip state telephone utility, which until now has held the monopoly, has
been estimated as worth up to L4,300bn (Pounds 1.7bn) although the heavy
investment required means profits are unlikely in the first few years of
operation.
Olivetti, which will provide 35 per cent of the investment by the winning
consortium (grouping Bell Atlantic, Pactel and Mannesmann) needs to provide
L200bn over eight years. Although Olivetti's board will ask shareholders for
authorisation, if necessary, for a rights issue up to L1 trillion, Mr Carlo
De Benedetti, chairman, has ruled out a capital increase this year.
Olivetti plans to use the licence as a key part of a new high-tech network
to serve mobile phone and computer users. The company, which had net losses
of L460bn in 1993, has sought increasingly to shift from unprofitable
hardware into services.
The contest was narrowed to two consortiums after two mergers between the
original four applicants.
The decision injects further pace into the restructuring of Italy's
telecommunications industry following agreement to merge five network
operators under the state-controlled Stet telecoms utility - itself due to
be privatised this year.
The cellular phones market is being opened up in Italy after pressure from
the European Commission and rapid growth is expected. The total sales of Sip
increased by 8.6 per cent last year to L23.4bn.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Europe's chemicals sector hopes to pool research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An initiative to promote industry-wide collaboration on research and
development in Europe's chemical sector is to start next month, it emerged
in Brussels yesterday.
It would mark the first attempt by companies to pool their research
resources to combat the growing US and Japanese threat.
The sector has been suffering from chronic overcapacity especially in
petrochemicals and bulk chemicals. Some unprofitable European plants are
protected from closure by national governments even though their prices are
deeply undercut by newer plants especially in Asia.
Mr Dirk Hudik, ICI's manager of European affairs, said yesterday that
research directors from European companies would meet next month to identify
suitable areas for sector-wide research.
Programmes would probably centre around environmental research, to develop
waste management technologies, greater energy efficiency and sustainable
production. Another possibility could be the use of information technology
in process control, Mr Hudik added.
Two more meetings are likely over the next six months, and the companies aim
to submit concrete proposals to the European Commission by the autumn in the
hope of attracting funding.
Under its research programme, the Commission usually provides half the
funding for joint industry projects, which have hitherto been limited to
pre-competitive research.
With the European chemical industry facing shrinking margins and mounting
research development costs, there has been growing interest in exploring
collaboration.
Mr Peter Schwarz, head of research at the Italian chemical group Enichem,
said yesterday: 'We believe co-operation will be a large part of operations
in the future, particularly in the situations of high risk of financial
exposure which are present in the chemical area.'

Ukrainian polls at the weekend revealed a widening rift between the
country's east and west.
People voted in large numbers to replace the communist-dominated parliament
that has blocked economic reform, but pro-communist forces in the east
secured resounding majorities in 'opinion polls' favouring closer ties with
Moscow.
Belying predictions of voter apathy, 75 per cent of the electorate turned
out at polls across the nation, taking all 450 parliamentary districts past
the necessary 50 per cent threshold.
President Leonid Kravchuk's advisers had been counting on a low turnout,
enabling them to declare the elections invalid and setting the stage for
presidential rule.
However, although the vote was a confusing one for many Ukrainians - with
some ballots carrying more than two dozen names - initial returns showed new
opposition faces emerging into the lead throughout the country.
The requirement that candidates also secure more than 50 per cent of the
vote to win a parliamentary seat saw 90 per cent of seats unfilled, however,
pending a run-off election on April 10 between the two leading candidates in
each district.
'For the most part, it looks like it'll be the new wave - democrats,
businessmen - versus the old guard in the run-offs,' said Mr Roman Zwarycz
of the independent Elections 94 press centre.
However, Crimea, the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, and the Lugansk
region on the Russian border ignored a presidential ban and held votes on
closer ties with Russia, which threaten to create new federal problems for
Mr Kravchuk.
The Crimean president's administration said more than 80 per cent of the
voters had endorsed a survey to form a special, more independent
relationship with Kiev and allow Russian-Ukrainian dual citizenship.
General Valery Kuznetsov, adviser to Crimean president Yuri Meshkov on
military affairs, said that the survey, which Mr Kravchuk had outlawed,
'showed once again that Crimea does not want to be prevented from living as
Crimeans want to live'.
A similar survey in Donetsk showed that 90 per cent of the electorate
favoured joining the CIS economic union, making Russian an official language
and decentralising the Ukrainian state, according to a preliminary estimate
.
In the 47 seats filled by an outright majority in the first round, a number
of high-profile national leaders secured seats, including Mr Ivan Plyushch,
parliamentary chairman, and Mr Victor Pynzenik, a market economist and
former government minister.
Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, who favoured closer relations
with Russia in his campaign, and Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the
opposition nationalist Rukh party, also won seats.
'These elections have been a positive event. The people have shown the
political will to improve their country,' commented Mr Vladimir Averchev, a
Russian MP observer for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe. 'I didn't realise how disillusioned Ukrainians were with the current
parliament.'
He added: 'I think the second round will go through and Ukraine will have a
real chance to head on the road to reforms.'
Ukrainian living standards have fallen rapidly in recent months, with
incomes eaten up by hyperinflation. However, the current Ukrainian
parliament, dominated by former communists, has been opposed both to
economic reform and to relinquishing the country's nuclear arsenal - a
condition of much western economic support.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Crisis threatens in Poland over cabinet post dispute
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's two-month search for a finance minister threatens to blow up into a
political crisis following the refusal of President Lech Walesa to accept Dr
Dariusz Rosati, a 47-year-old economist, for the post.
Mr Marek Borowski resigned as finance minister after a dispute with Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister, over control of the economy. The lack of a
successor has left policy-making in a state of flux just as the government
faces new talks with the International Monetary Fund on a standby agreement.
Dr Rosati, currently employed by the United Nations in Geneva, said
yesterday he was considering withdrawing his candidature, which was put
forward by the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), the senior coalition partner.
The president's decision appears to mark the start of open hostilities with
the SLD which could paralyse the government.
At the weekend, Mr Walesa threatened to dissolve parliament after Mr
Borowski suggested that the president's constitutional powers to block
government appointments might be curtailed.
Mr Pawlak, who leads the farmers party (PSL), the junior coalition partner,
yesterday issued a statement supporting Dr Rosati's candidature 'for as long
as the SLD or Dr Rosati maintain it'.
However, Mr Pawlak has not been happy with Dr Rosati's candidature and the
president's veto is aimed at widening the rift between the two coalition
partners. Mr Walesa particularly wants to weaken Mr Alexander Kwasniewski,
the youthful SLD leader who is a serious challenger for the presidency in
elections due in the autumn of 1995.
At the root of the dispute over the finance post is an attempt by Mr Pawlak
to establish his primacy over the cabinet and redefine the original
coalition agreement which handed responsibility for economic and financial
policy to the SLD when the government was formed last autumn.

The main construction work of the Leuna 2000 oil refinery, one of the

This follows the resolution of a dispute between Elf Aquitaine, the French
oil group, and the Treuhand privatisation agency, Mr Philippe Jaffre, Elf's
chairman, said yesterday.
Mr Jaffre said Elf's board had approved the draft accord with the Treuhand
yesterday but said certain areas still needed clarifying. He believed,
however, that a final agreement could be signed by the end of the month.
Under the terms of the agreement, Elf will reduce its stake in the DM4.5bn
(Pounds 1.75bn) project from 67 per cent to 43 per cent, following the
acquisition of a 24 per cent stake by Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil
group. It will also be relieved of a requirement to retain an additional 33
per cent stake from Thyssen Handels-union, a subsidiary of the German steel
group, should Thyssen sell the stake after the refinery is built.
The areas of clarification requested by Elf's board include the terms by
which the 33 per cent stake would be transferred from Thyssen to Buna, the
German state-owned chemicals company. Mr Jaffre said Elf wanted to be sure
that the terms of the transactions were fair.
He said his decision to reduce Elf's stake in the project, which prompted an
angry reaction from the Treuhand, was based on concerns about its viability
under the terms of the original agreement. 'The project was too big for Elf
to undertake alone. We needed the backing of a solid German partner,' he
said.
According to Mr Jaffre, the future of the project could not have been
guaranteed without a partner committed to the refinery after the
construction phase. He said that Elf would have pulled out of the project if
partners had not been found. 'I would have preferred to cut off my finger
than my hand,' he said.
Mr Jaffre, who took over as Elf chairman last August, said he was satisfied
with the participation of Rosneft and denied that this involved risks. He
said the Russians were to pay for their stake in crude oil, which they
needed to export. A similar agreement had been negotiated with Rosneft under
the previous Elf chairman, Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent.
According to Mr Jaffre, the compromise agreement does not include the
surrender of any Minol service stations which were acquired as part of the
oil refinery deal. Buna may take a 33 per cent stake in Minol, but Elf says
it would still be left with a controlling 66 per cent share.

FT  29 MAR 94 / S African leaders call emergency summit after 18 die in gun
battle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South Africa's political leaders last night called an emergency summit after
gun battles in the heart of Johannesburg's business district left at least
18 people dead and provoked calls for a state of emergency to control
violence ahead of next month's elections.
Thousands of Inkatha Freedom party supporters, staging an anti-election
march in South Africa's commercial capital, attempted to storm the
headquarters of the African National Congress. ANC security guards shot at
them, killing at least eight.
Witnesses said the marchers were also shot at outside the city library,
where several were killed by snipers firing from nearby buildings. Police
said at least 50 people were injured, but independent sources, who put the
death toll at 31, indicated that the casualty figure could be higher.
In response to the mayhem, South Africa's four most important political
leaders - President FW de Klerk, ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela, Inkatha
leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini - are to
meet together for the first time at a two-day summit beginning tomorrow.
They will discuss ANC demands that troops be sent to Natal province, where
at least 55 people were killed last weekend.
The Johannesburg killings aroused the country's worst fears of growing
violence forcing the delay or abandonment of next month's first all-race
elections unless brought under control.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, said a state of emergency would have to be
considered to ensure the poll could take place from April 26 to 28.
President de Klerk said the time had come for 'urgent consideration . . . of
additional measures or steps which can prevent a repetition of what has
happened today'.
Tension had been building for several days, with Inkatha supporters angered
by ANC threats to depose Chief Buthelezi and his KwaZulu administration.
For the first time in a decade of violence in and around Johannesburg,
large-scale unrest broke out in the city centre itself, within earshot of
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange where share prices fell sharply. The city
was last night declared an 'unrest area' by Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law
and order, giving police special powers.
In past outbreaks of political violence, South African leaders have rapidly
stabilised the position. But as the election draws closer, defusing crises
has become more difficult.

<TEXT>
Romanian-born French playwright Eugene Ionesco (left), one of a group of
'absurdist' writers whose work dominated postwar European theatre, died in
Paris aged 81. Ionesco captivated audiences worldwide with a unique blend of
black humour and farce. His most famous plays, La Lecon, Les Chaises, La
Cantatrice Chauve and Rhinoceros were written in the 1950s. A militant
anti-Communist, Ionesco campaigned from exile against former Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Cabinet poised to accept deal over EU voting rights: Tory
backbenchers angry over 'climbdown'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night preparing to accept the proposed compromise
with its European partners over voting rights. The move should pave the way
for four new members to enter the Union next January.
But as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, awaited cabinet endorsement
of the arrangement this morning, Mr Major, the prime minister, was accused
on the Conservative backbenches of reneging on pledges to strike a harder
bargain.
To limit the potential backlash among Tory MPs, Mr Hurd was awaiting urgent
assurances from the European Commission that in future it will not seek to
circumvent Britain's opt-out from the social provisions of the Maastricht
treaty.
The foreign secretary expects to receive this morning a written commitment
from Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, that in future Brussels
will not use health and safety legislation to frustrate the opt-out.
The compromise - tabled at a weekend meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Greece - raises to 27 from the present 23 the number of votes required to
block decisions in the Council of Ministers once the Union is enlarged.
But it allows for a legally enforceable pause in decision-making when
countries muster between 23 and 27 votes. It also stresses that the new
arrangement is an interim one, with the whole question of the relative
voting strengths of small and large EU countries to be reopened in 1996.
With the other 11 EU governments expected to endorse it, senior Brussels
diplomats said the UK had little choice but to do likewise or risk
triggering a crisis with its other EU partners over enlargement. Sir Leon
Brittan, the senior British commissioner in Brussels, also urged acceptance.
But the consensus at Westminster was that by encouraging his supporters to
believe he would take a more determined stance, Mr Major had again damaged
his political authority.
Anticipating the anger also of rightwing ministers about an arrangement
which falls short of Britain's original demands, Mr Hurd refused publicly to
anticipate the cabinet's decision.
But, speaking in the House of Commons, he made it clear that his own
political authority rested on an accord which he insisted had safeguarded
Britain's interests without delaying the entry into the EU of Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Austria.
Other pivotal figures in the cabinet, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr
Michael Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, offered Mr Hurd their full backing.
That left cabinet Eurosceptics such as Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Portillo
and Mr John Redwood the stark options of backing the compromise or
resigning. Despite some speculation that Mr Lilley might consider such a
course, the judgment of most ministers was that it was not an issue on which
the cabinet's sceptics would make a public stand.
Close friends of Mr Hurd also dismissed suggestions that the latest row has
persuaded him to stand down as foreign secretary when Mr Major reshuffles
the cabinet in the summer. The friends insisted that Mr Hurd wants to stay
at the Foreign Office at least until mid-1995.
The foreign secretary stressed repeatedly his view that the proposed accord
had gone as far as he thought possible. Stressing the legal status of the
proposed pause and its interim nature, Mr Hurd gave the impression that in
practical terms the blocking minority would stay at 23 votes. But he
admitted that once efforts to secure an agreement on that basis had been
exhausted, the new position meant decisions could in fact be pushed through
on the basis of a minority of 27.
In Brussels, officials said the compromise expressly excluded an open-ended
discussion on decisions which were opposed by countries mustering between 23
and 26 votes in the council.
The draft text says: 'The council will do all in its power to reach, within
a reasonable time and without prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down
by the treaties and by secondary law . . . a satisfactory solution.'

FT  29 MAR 94 / Berlusconi alliance heads for clear win in Italian poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night staked his claim to head
Italy's next government, after initial projections gave his three-party
rightwing Freedom Alliance a clear lead over his rivals in elections for
parliament.
Mr Berlusconi, who turned to politics less than four months ago after
scandals demolished many veteran politicians, pledged to relaunch the
economy with a free-market programme. But he acknowledged he would have
difficulty in putting together a government with his allies in the Freedom
Alliance - the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and Mr
Gianfranco Fini of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. 'We must be united
in victory,' he declared.
Computer projections based on partial counting of votes indicated that the
Freedom Alliance would be the largest bloc and was likely to win an absolute
majority in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. One projection early
today suggested it could get as many as 375 seats in the 630-member chamber.
The Freedom Alliance appeared less likely to gain a working majority in the
upper house, the Senate, which has power to block legislation. But one
projection gave it 150-160 seats in the 315-member Senate. Final results are
not expected to be known until tonight after two days of voting under an
experimental system mixing first-past-the-post and proportional
representation.
A dejected Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS) - which co-ordinated the leftwing Progressive Alliance - conceded his
seven-party grouping had failed to win enough support to determine the next
government.
The centre alliance, composed of former Christian Democrats in the Popular
Party (PPI) and the centrist pact of Mr Mario Segni, was squeezed. Early
projections gave the Italian Pact 45-65 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
The result is an extraordinary personal success for Mr Berlusconi, whose
Forza Italia movement appeared to have won about 25 per cent of the vote
nationwide. The Milan-born Mr Berlusconi looked set to win his own
first-past-the-post contest in Rome against Prof Luigi Spaventa, the budget
minister and candidate for the Progressives.
Another big success was the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, which exit
polls showed to have won 13 per cent of the vote.
Signalling tension in the Freedom Alliance, Mr Bossi said the victory was
one of a 'reactionary right' and he accused the neo-fascists of 'trying to
open up the wallets of the north' to aid the poorer south.
The Italian financial markets had surged yesterday with strong buying based
on reports that the Freedom Alliance was likely to win. The Milan stock
market's main index added 3.76 per cent.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Balladur retreats on cutting young workers' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday effectively
abandoned his controversial law cutting wages for young trainee workers, in
a move designed to end a month of street protests by students and unions.
Mr Balladur made his fourth retreat on domestic policy in recent months
after government parties did slightly less well than they had hoped in local
council elections on Sunday.
After meeting student leaders, he announced he had suspended the contrat
d'insertion professionelle (CIP) for a week and instructed the head of the
ANPE national employment agency to find an alterative system within that
time. The CIP, which permits young apprentices to be paid less than the
minimum wage, passed into law last autumn. Decrees implementing it were
published last month.
Though the CIP law has not been formally scrapped - as students and unions
have demanded - Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, budget minister and government
spokesman, made clear this was the intention. He said the mission of Mr
Michel Bon, head of the ANPE, was to 'define a new system and put an end to
the CIP'.
Student union leaders welcomed Mr Balladur's suspension of the CIP 'as a
first step', but said their members would not be satisfied until the law was
scrapped. They indicated they might go ahead with a protest march planned
for Thursday.
As late as last Friday, when 30,000 students marched in Paris against the
CIP, Mr Balladur seemed resolved to make an exception to his previous
tendency to give way in the face of street protests. He had already watered
down the original CIP to maintain the minimum wage for diploma-holders and
to strengthen training provisions for unqualified youths receiving less than
the minimum wage.
But on Sunday night, Mr Balladur promised to 're-establish a dialogue' with
the nation's youth and to 'examine various possible solutions' to the CIP.
In addition to Mr Bon's mission, which may result in the creation of a
special job agency for the 25 per cent of French young who are without work,
the government plans to consult a variety of youth organisations.
In contrast to his strong policy stands, for example in maintaining French
troops in Bosnia or pursuing a firm franc, Mr Balladur has tended to
surrender on social issues at home.
Over the past year he has yielded to striking Air France employees
protesting against lay-offs, to defenders of state education complaining
about a proposed improvement in private school finance, and to fishermen
demonstrating against imports.

Italy's financial markets surged yesterday with strong buying based on
reports that the right-wing Freedom Alliance, headed by media magnate Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, was likely to win an overall parliamentary majority.
The Milan stock market's main index added 3.76 per cent, while the lira
strengthened against the dollar and the D-Mark on hopes of a stable
government. 'The market got stronger and stronger as rumours were spread of
a Berlusconi victory,' said Mr Alberto Rolla of securities house Milla.
Reaction in the markets was based on leaked exit polls conducted by at least
three organisations during Sunday's voting in the country's general
election. It did not take account of yesterday's second and final day of
voting when polling stations were due to close at 10 pm local time.
Electoral regulations banned the publication of exit polls until the
stations had closed, but leaks gave between 46 per cent and 51 per cent of
the vote to the Freedom Alliance, composed of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia
movement, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini.
On the basis of these polls, the Freedom Alliance could have as many as 340
seats in the 630-seat chamber of deputies.
In contrast, the seven-party Progressive Alliance headed by the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left would have about 240 seats. The
centre Italian Pact, headed by Mr Mario Segni, would have a maximum of 60
seats.
Throughout the day political analysts continued to voice caution about
predicting the outcome. They pointed out that exit polls might be unable to
measure accurately the returns from Italy's experiment with two different
election systems - a first-past-the-post method covering 75 per cent of the
seats and proportional representation for the remainder.
It was also far from clear yesterday whether Forza Italia's northern
electoral ally, the Northern League, would be part of a government coalition
formed by the Freedom Alliance.
Speaking before the count yesterday, Mr Marco Formentini, the Northern
League mayor of Milan, stressed that his federalist party would not join the
National Alliance in government.
He said that for this reason it was important for the Northern League and
Forza Italia to stay together and that it might be possible to find other
allies with which to form a government.

FT  29 MAR 94 / Smith New Court turns bonuses into golden handcuffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court, the securities house, is attacking the long-standing City
tradition of 'take the money and run' by transforming annual bonuses into
golden handcuffs.
The company yesterday announced a plan to encourage loyalty by paying staff
part of their annual bonus in Smith New Court shares. Individuals will only
receive these shares if they are still employed by the company three years
later.
One of the principal aims of the scheme is to stem the exodus of leading
staff from Smith New Court. Last year, departures included its highly rated
oil and banking analysts to Nomura and its utilities team to Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, said last night: 'This is partly about
retention of staff. We are not ashamed about that. People were taking a
large bonus and then trotting off to the next franchise. That can't be in
the interests of shareholders.'
He stressed that the incentive scheme would also foster a greater sense of
ownership by staff in the company. 'It will hopefully give them a meaningful
stake,' he said.
Mr Marks said a small trial version of the scheme had run last year and only
one of the 20 people involved had since left Smith New Court.
The shares will not be newly issued, as in many existing share option
schemes. The cash that would otherwise have been paid out in bonuses will
instead be used to buy shares from current shareholders.
In a circular sent to shareholders yesterday, the company is seeking
authority for up to 15 per cent of its equity to be held in trust for this
purpose.
Smith New Court is still deciding how much of the bonus will be paid in
shares, although some insiders suggest it is likely to run to a maximum for
more senior staff of up to about 25 per cent. More than 90 per cent of staff
at the company received bonuses last year.
Shareholders will vote on the plan at an extraordinary general meeting on
April 20. It is also subject to final approval by the Inland Revenue.
The proposals come after a year of high bonuses paid by City institutions.
Earlier this month, it emerged that BZW paid total remuneration including
bonuses of more than Pounds 1m to up to eight of its directors.

By common consent, the domestic German car market is unlikely to make much

Encouraged by the US recovery, the launch of a cut-off version of its

FT  28 MAR 94 / ANC action aims to secure poll freedom in S Africa province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress said yesterday that it would escalate mass
protest action aimed at ensuring free political activity in the strife-torn
Natal province, where ANC and Inkatha Freedom party members clashed again at
the weekend over preparations for next month's all-race elections.
South African government officials said Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha
leader, held a five-hour meeting with President FW de Klerk on Saturday, at
which he gave assurances that free campaigning would be allowed in the
KwaZulu homeland which he heads, and that elections could take place there
despite Inkatha's poll boycott.
However, Inkatha supporters appeared to have ignored these assurances
yesterday, when armed Zulus occupied a stadium in northern Natal where the
ANC was to have held an election rally.
This was the third time in succession that Inkatha had prevented a weekend
election rally in Natal, where more than 100 people have died in the past
week.
Officials said they hoped that Chief Buthelezi's assurances to Mr de Klerk
would defuse the immediate crisis over Natal, and help persuade the ANC to
defer its demands that some of the chief's powers be suspended and a state
of emergency declared. However, this seems unlikely.
The ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, the multiparty body
overseeing government in the run-up to elections, is due to meet again today
to discuss the crisis in Natal province.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, yesterday said South African
troops should move into the region to help halt the violence. 'We are going
to insist that security forces must protect the lives of our people in
Natal. They must also ensure that there is free political activity.
'The ANC on its part has embarked on a programme of rolling mass action to
ensure that we win our demand for free political activity,' Mr Ramaphosa
told a Cape Town news briefing.
'That is going to escalate for as long as Buthelezi and his government do
not finally agree that they will give space to political parties to operate
freely, and unless he agrees the KwaZulu government will co-operate with the
IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) in as far as the holding of free and
fair elections is concerned,' said Mr Ramaphosa.
Chief Buthelezi said at the weekend that a troop deployment 'could be seen
as an invasion'.
More than 10,000 people have died in violence in Natal over the past decade.

The Hong Kong stock exchange has taken a further step towards adoption of
international standards with the release of a consultative paper proposing
full disclosure of directors' salaries and calling for an end to the
practice of 'hidden' reserves.
If passed, the changes to the listing rules would open up directors'
renumeration to full scrutiny. Companies would be obliged to list directors'
fees, basic salaries plus bonuses, housing allowance and benefits in kind,
pension scheme contributions and golden hellos and goodbyes.
The stock exchange is also getting tough on banks, insurance and shipping
companies which are currently allowed to maintain 'hidden' reserves.

regulation is to implement the policy of economic (openness) for the

The officials said private banks had been allowed to operate in Burma for

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen poor nations with large markets plan to seek better economic deals
from industrialised nations at a three-day summit that begins today in New
Delhi, reports AP.
Police went on alert yesterday as heads of state of eight countries of the
Group of 15 began arriving. The other countries are represented by
government ministers or senior officials.
About 7,000 policemen ringed many buildings in the city where the meetings
will be held.
Member countries from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean will
seek closer co-operation with the Group of Seven of the world's largest
industrialised nations: the US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and
Britain.
'We collectively represent a GDP of Dollars 1,400bn. Our total trade
turnover is Dollars 404bn,' Indian foreign minister Dinesh Singh told the
meeting that was drafting a communique to be adopted at the end of the
summit.
The developing countries hope to have greater bargaining power with rich
nations by pooling their natural and human resources.
Apart from the host, India, presidents or prime ministers of Nigeria,
Senegal, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Indonesia and Malaysia are taking part in the
conference. Mexico, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Algeria, Egypt, Brazil and
Jamaica are sending representatives.
Critics of the G-15 say that, during the five years since it was created,
the organisation has lost much of its significance as many of the members
prefer to line up with regional trading blocs. The preference for such
arrangements is underscored by poor attendance at the meetings.
Others, however, maintain that the group is still relevant.
'The industrialised countries will make poor nations do what they want. The
only way out is for the less powerful countries to get together,' said AP
Venkateswaran, a former external affairs secretary for India.
The conference is unlikely to force richer countries to relax import quotas
on merchandise such as textiles or to retain their subsidies on food exports
to poor countries under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Many poor nations say that, under GATT rules, they will have to pay
royalties for products that used not to entail patents under intellectual
property rights.

28 MONDAY
Italian elections
Monday is the second day of the Italian elections. A clear pattern may not
be apparent until late on Tuesday and it may take many days to form a
government. The two leading contenders are the Alliance for Freedom - led by
Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia - and the Progressive Alliance, led by the
Democratic Party of the Left.
Ugandan polls
Uganda holds elections for a constituent assembly that will debate President
Yoweri Museveni's new constitution. The most controversial clause of the
draft charter seeks to ban political parties until at least the year 2000.
During the current campaign, candidates have not been allowed to identify
themselves publicly with any political party, but they have been able to
argue in favour of a return to party politics.
G-15 summit
PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian PM, hosts a three-day summit of representatives
of 15 developing countries. His guests include Dr Mahathir Mohammed of
Malaysia, President Suharto of Indonesia and heads of government from
Nigeria, Argentina, Senegal and Zimbabwe plus cabinet-level representatives
from Algeria, Brazil, Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Chile.
North-south issues top the agenda.
Nazarbayev visits Moscow
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan is scheduled to begin talks in
Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin.  Talks will focus on the future of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, economic agreement between Russia and
Kazakhstan, and the future of the Baikanur space launch centre - where a
deal is now thought likely on a proposal to run the centre jointly between
the two countries. Also thought to be susceptible to compromise is a quarrel
between the two states on the issue of dual citizenship for the 40 per cent
of the population of Russian origin.
Radio 5 Live launched
The BBC launches Radio Five Live, its 24-hour news and sport network, backed
by an extensive advertising campaign.
The new network emerged as a compromise following the bitter row created by
plans to turn Radio 4 long-wave radio over to an all news network and
restrict Radio 4 to FM coverage. This would have prevented Radio 4 coverage
reaching continental Europe. The loss of the Radio Five sports network also
raised opposition, although sports programmes are transferring to the new
network.
Albanian president in London
President Sali Berisha will begin the first visit of an Albanian head of
state to Britain today, nearly two years after the two countries settled a
long-standing dispute over Albanian gold seized in the second world war.

29 TUESDAY
Craxi goes on trial
Former Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi goes on trial in Milan, becoming
the highest ranking politician yet to face charges in the country's
corruption scandals.
The trial begins a day after a general election based on a new electoral
system in which three-quarters of deputies in the parliament's lower house
will be elected on a first-past-the-post basis. About a fifth of the
parliament's outgoing members have been involved in the corruption
inquiries.
Mr Craxi, former leader of the Socialist party, is to be tried over bribes
alleged to have been paid by an insurance group for contracts with Eni, the
state energy concern. Mr Craxi, who denies the charges, faces a possible
maximum jail sentence of five years.
Cairo talks resume
Talks resume to put the finishing touches to the deployment of Norwegian
observers and Palestinian police in Hebron, where an Israeli fanatic
massacred Moslems last month.
EU argues over mad cows
The UK and Germany confront each other at a meeting of EU agriculture
ministers over Bonn's wish to ban British beef imports because of fear of
'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The European
Commission will tell Germany that it will take legal action if it introduces
a unilateral ban. Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row
on Wednesday.
Loch Ness submarine
The first submarine to take passengers on a deep dive to try to glimpse the
Scottish lake's elusive monster will be launched.
Japanese retail sales
The Japanese economy may be reaching the bottom of its long downturn but
retail sales remain sluggish. Figures out today are expected to show a 2.5
per cent decline in the year to February. In the year to November, the fall
was 6.9 per cent. Rising unemployment is expected to limit the ability of
retail sales to rebound.
Heseltine to defend takeover
Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, is to be questioned
by MPs over the takeover of Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent
and The Independent on Sunday, by a consortium backed by Mirror Group
Newspapers. Mr Heseltine decided last week not to refer the deal to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the grounds that the papers were not
economic as going concerns.

30 WEDNESDAY
Clarke meets Bank head
The monthly monetary meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer (left), and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will
consider the merits of a cut in interest rates. The weakness of sterling and
last week's disappointing inflation figures may point them away from a cut;
however, Mr Clarke may be keen to reduce rates to offset the impact of the
1994-95 tax increases and to create some good news ahead of the May local
elections.
Highways Agency born
The Highways Agency, which will take over the detailed implementation of
Britain's road building and maintenance programme from the Department of
Transport, comes into being. Nearly 2,500 civil servants will transfer into
the agency which will pay its senior officials on a performance-related
basis depending on the speed and efficiency with which they build roads.
Also the Maritime Safety Agency and Coastguard Agency take over
responsibility for ship safety, maritime pollution and emergency rescue
services at sea.
Pensions debate
MPs will discuss personal pensions and the need for direct regulation of the
private pension sector. The full-scale House of Commons debate is set to
focus on concerns about the mis-selling of personal pensions to those
leaving or transferring out of occupational pension schemes; and to those
contracting out of the state earnings-related pension scheme.
It will also cover the controversy about the right system of regulating
financial services for the private investor. The government backs the
planned personal investment authority - which also has the support of the
Prudential, the biggest UK life company - while Labour would prefer direct,
statutory regulation.
EU and Lithuania talk trade
The European Union and Lithuania hold the second round of talks on a free
trade agreement.
Japanese industrial production
The figures are expected to show a seasonally adjusted monthly rise of 2.1
per cent, compared with a 1 per cent increase in January. However,
production will still be lower than it was a year ago.
Indian trade policy
India will make its annual statement on trade policy, which is likely to
include further important measures to liberalise imports and exports.

31 THURSDAY
CIS hears Russia's terms
The Commonwealth of Independent States' leaders come together in Moscow.
Russia's proposal for a 'rouble zone' is likely to be pressed once more -
but the Belarussian representatives will ask why their efforts to become
more closely integrated with Russia have so far been repelled.
The new members from the Caucasus, Georgia and Azerbaijan, will press Russia
to settle the conflicts on their territories and in the former's case,
salvage its collapsed economy. Ukraine, where elections may reveal a swing
towards pro-Russian political forces, has the problem of indebtedness to
Russia for energy to settle - and that of the ownership of the Black Sea
Fleet.
Russia is likely to make it clear that the terms for assistance are becoming
increasingly steep, and that if the countries want help, they must act as
hosts to the Russian army and support the Russian political line.
Clinton's unacceptable list
The Clinton Administration plans to issue a preliminary list of what it
considers unacceptable trade barriers implemented by foreign nations against
American exports. On March 3 President Clinton revived the Super 301 trade
policy weapon, allowing him to impose sanctions against targeted countries
if they fail to dismantle barriers to American exports.
Commons recess
The House of Commons will break for Easter between March 31 and April 12.
Nicholson arraigned
Actor Jack Nicholson is scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles on charges
stemming from an incident in which he is alleged to have smashed another
driver's windscreen with a golf club.
Romanian budget delay
Romania has until today to adopt a 1994 budget, otherwise, under the
constitution, last year's budget will come into force. The delay is holding
up a Dollars 700m International Monetary Fund loan package.
French unemployment figures
The French government will be hoping that February's unemployment figures
will show a slowdown in the rise of joblessness. Economists expect another
increase, although they believe that the rate is unlikely to rise much above
the current level of 12.2 per cent.
One in four young people between the ages of 16 and 25 are out of work, the
highest rate in the G7 group of industrialised countries. Attempts to reduce
youth unemployment, through the introduction of apprentice schemes under
which 16-25 year olds can be paid less than the minimum wage, have, however,
prompted widespread student demonstrations.
Air France ultimatum
Air France has given its 14 unions until today to agree to a plan to boost
productivity by 30 per cent at the loss-making state-owned airline over
three years.
1 GOOD FRIDAY
British Rail dismantled
British Rail takes another important step towards its eventual privatisation
with the handing over of BR's tracks, signalling and stations to Railtrack,
a newly created company. Some 25 passenger train operating units,
corresponding to BR's existing profit centres, will take over the running of
trains. Three rolling stock leasing companies will be set up to lease

Monday: Monthly mortgage lending figures, released by the British Bankers'
Association, will be watched for signs of the strength of the UK housing
market.
Wednesday: The Bank of England will hold a Pounds 2.5bn auction of floating
rate gilts, the first floating rate issue since the 1970s. Banks and
building societies are expected to be the main buyers. The monthly monetary
report, published to coincide with the meeting of the governor of the Bank
and the chancellor of the exchequer, is largely a compendium of statistics.
Nevertheless, it will be scrutinised for hints of future interest rate
policy.
Thursday: Italian inflation figures, which could be published today, are
expected to show an annual rise in the year to March of 4.2 per cent,
unchanged from the February rate.
Friday: Although most markets will be closed, analysts will be watching for
details of US non-farm payrolls in March. Improved weather is expected to
have boosted the construction industry in March, helping payrolls to rise by
230,000. Some analysts feel, however, that February's 217,000 jump in
payrolls could be revised down.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (9): An extraordinary innovator /
Profile of Hank Greenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We do try to understand risk. We try to work out plans to manage it
successfully,' says Hank Greenberg, explaining one of the basic philosophies
of American International Group, of which he is chief executive and
chairman. 'In fact,' adds Mr Greenberg, 'we welcome new developments of risk
in society because it gives us new opportunities'.
On the surface this sounds unexceptional. Yet AIG's success in implementing
Greenberg's philosophy marks the company off from many of its competitors in
both the United States and other insurance markets and has been the basis
for the group's success.
By any standards AIG's growth over the past 30 years has been formidable. It
has increased its premium income from just Dollars 237m in 1968 to nearly
Dollars 16bn in 1993. And although its market capitalisation base is still
smaller than those of Europe's biggest companies, such as Allianz,AIG is
much more profitable than most of its rivals with pre-tax profits of Dollars
2.6bn in 1993.
How has the success been achieved? For a start, Mr Greenberg keeps an iron
grip on costs which can be up to a third lower than some of its competitors.
Unlike some of its US rivals AIG has no pretences of maintaining an
organisation that can sell all types of insurance products to all types of
customers in every US state.
'To believe you have to go into business to protect other businesses is a
mistaken judgement or that you have to have a certain market share
regardless of results is a mistaken policy,' explains Greenberg.
Mercilessly critical of underwriting standards in the US industry, and a
policy - commonly followed by many rivals - of compensating insurance losses
with investment income, and in recent years by capital gains, Mr Greenberg
explains that AIG puts much more emphasis on underwriting profits.
'Underwriting is our first business and that is what we judge ourselves on,'
says Mr Greenberg. Certainly AIG is not frightened of the sudden and
exceptional risk. 'The market place eliminates one-time big losses but
unusual events occur on a frequent basis. It is kind of hard to take them
out and say they are not occurring.'
Whereas many insurance companies have quit difficult markets such as those
offering cover for environmental pollution, AIG has stuck with its
customers. 'We are in the risk business,' says Mr Greenberg. 'If we fail to
respond to the needs of society or corporate society then we are simply
encouraging self-insurance.'
AIG spends heavily on its divisions which 'research and develop' new
products. 'We eagerly seek things out rather than continuing to do just what
we did yesterday,' adds Mr Greenberg.
This philosophy takes AIG into what many more conservative companies would
consider high-risk markets overseas and in the US. AIG, which started as a
Shanghai-based underwriting agency in 1919, is now back in China, for
example - as the only foreign insurance company licensed to underwrite
business.
The achievement at least partially reflects Mr Greenberg's own personal
determination. He has visited the country every year since 1975 to maintain
contacts. AIG subsidiaries are leading participants in the life insurance
markets of south-east Asia and are actively seeking to build up business in
eastern Europe. By acquiring an interest of more than 20 per cent in the
Robert Plan, a New York-based insurer, which successfully specialises in
high risk motor insurance, Mr Greenberg signalled an interest in the
crime-ridden markets of inner-urban America, which have been 'red-lined' by
principal competitors.
Robert Plan makes money in New York by rigorous screening of potential
customers and claimants. But nowhere has this philosophy been clearer than
in tough commercial risks such as US legal liabilities. During the 1970s,
when US insurance companies left the liability insurance market over fears
about esclating court awards in product liability and medical malpractice,
many corporate buyers were forced to examine self-insurance and risk
management for the first time, sometimes setting up captive insurance
companies, dedicated insurance subsidiaries.
AIG set up a risk management company, which advised companies on captives,
helped them administer claims and plan insurance and reinsurance
arrangements.
Later in the mid-1980s when the market for liability insurance shrank
further, AIG expanded its business, combining with three other companies to
offer a basic liability insurance facility to US business. AIG also offers a
series of specialist liability insurance products. For example, the AIG
subsidiary, National Union Fire of Pittsburg, is a big underwriter of
directors and officers insurance - which protects boards and senior
management against legal action from creditors and shareholders.
Lexington, another subsidiary, specialises in placing property and liability
risks for health care, construction and some other industries, and pioneered
insurance products which provide insurance for employers suffering lawsuits
alleging discriminatiion or sexual harassment, especially after the
disabilities and civil rights legislation of 1991 and 1992.
One of the principal features of all these products is risk control
programmes, which help customers root out practices which would give rise to
legal action, reducing AIG's exposure to potential claims. For example,
National Union has assembled a national panel of specialist law firms to
help clients deal with litigation by shareholders.
AIG's interest in the US liability system has led Mr Greenberg to take a
highly visible public stance on environmental laws, which potentially
threaten the viability of sections of the insurance industry. Owners or
operators of waste sites ordered by the government's environmental agency to
clean-up polluted areas under the so-called 'superfund' laws, face a bill
for billions of dollars. Many are already suing their insurance companies
for the bill and - depending on the decisions of many state and federal
courts - much of the cost could eventually hit the insurance industry.
Mr Greenberg says AIG's exposure is minimal. 'AIG was a very small company
in the 1960s and 1970s when many of these sites were created.' Nevertheless
AIG is pressing for change.
Mr Greenberg says that reform proposals unveiled earlier this year by the
Clinton administration are too 'convoluted', insufficiently different from
the current regime and have little chance of becoming law. He will continue
to press for reform to a structure which has become 'bizarre' and 'hurts
economic development'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (8): Decision-makers grow wary -
Boardroom attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FLEMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although risk management has not yet achieved the recognition in the UK and
Europe that it enjoys in North America, its profile is developing fast. As
the business climate and attitudes to litigation continue to change,
European organisations are realising their vulnerability to factors and
situations beyond their immediate control and are turning increasingly to
risk management for protection.
The ultimate risk managers of any organisation are the members of the board,
but modern business trends such as 'just in time', minimising inventories
and streamlining production - very often with single source suppliers - have
introduced numerous new factors into the risk equation and further
complicated the decision-making process. More than ever before, the senior
decision-makers require access to all the facts, and not only those which a
champion for a new business venture is likely to emphasise.
As a result, a new dynamic role is being created. Increasingly, boards are
coming to rely upon their risk managers to supply a 'risk profile' of the
principal exposures and the perception of the importance of risk management
is growing.
This changing perception has been reflected by corresponding changes at
Airmic, the UK organisation dedicated to representing the interests of
insurance and risk management professionals, which has recently introduced
corporate membership. Despite the fact that it has not yet actively marketed
the new membership category, the association already has some 80 corporate
members, most of which are drawn from the UK's top 200 companies.
The credibility of insurance buyers and risk managers at board level has
been much enhanced by Airmic during the past two years, as a result of its
drive to fully represent the views of its members to the government and
other decision makers. The association has played a crucial role from the
outset in the terrorism issue, and has been heavily involved in the debate
on equalisation reserves for insurance companies, the imposition of
insurance premium tax, environmental considerations, and a number of other
technical insurance-related issues.
This high profile has earned the association an authoritative position on
risk management and insurance issues. It now maintains a regular programme
of contact with MPs, the UK's department of trade and industry and other
government departments.
Many of Airmic's members are multinational organisations and demand a global
view of risk management issues. The association has done much to strengthen
relationships with overseas risk management organisations and to ensure that
the UK does not become isolated. This is an important consideration in view
of the evolution of a single Europe where, with the continuous development
of European Union (EU) legislation, risk management organisations share a
common interest.
Airmic plays an active role alongside the Association Europeenne Des Assures
De L'Industrie (AEAI) which represents the various European risk management
societies. This activity is important because it gives Airmic access to a
lobbying capability in Brussels, the heart of the EU.
Airmic is also a key member of the International Federation of Insurance and
Risk Management Associations (Ifrima), through which it liaises with sister
organisations in Europe, North and South America, Australia, South Africa,
India and the Far East. Airmic works together on a number of issues with the
North American Association Rims which, together with the Public Risk
Insurance Management Association (Prima), is a very powerful organisation
with significant influence and lobbying capability.
A principal objective of all the risk management associations is to enhance
the credibility of the function at the most senior level as any structured
risk management approach will work properly only if it is endorsed at this
level. The reality is, however, that most risks are encountered at
operational level, and this is where the emphasis on control should fall.
Risk management is not just about catastrophic events; it is a culture that,
like safety and quality, should be imbued throughout the organisation. An
important building block is an open-minded review of past experience and
significant benefits can be gained from analysis of incidents, both in
frequency and cause.
Another important feature of any risk management programme is its risk
transfer and insurance arrangements. Many organisations in North America and
in Europe are building their risk management structures alongside what used
to be the insurance department. The diversity of the function is such that
there is unlikely to be any one section of the organisation with a wide
enough remit to influence all aspects; however, we believe that the risk
management function should operate not in an independent way but as a
catalyst, in making sure that a broad perspective is taken of risk
situations and co-operative expertise brought to the problems and the board.

Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (AIRMIC)

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (6): The art of planning for a
disaster - Contingency planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON REYNOLDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extensive damage, injury and death caused by terrorist bomb explosions
in New York, London, Northern Ireland, Milan, and elsewhere provide the most
pointed lessons in the need for contingency planning.
However, the discipline is relevant not only to such high profile events,
but also to the management of any incident which affects continuity of
business. Threats arise from many diverse sources, including: fire, flood,
or storm; employee fraud or negligence; computer virus; a health alert
(perhaps a case of legionnaire's disease); or injury to key staff.
Even seemingly prosaic events, such as loss of a corporate stationery
storage facility through fire, can disrupt a business. A threat might be
posed by an incident which strikes a supplier, affecting its ability to
deliver key components. As Chris Chandler, of Continuity Planning
Associates, says: 'Our definition of a disaster is any unplanned occurrence
which seriously affects an organisation's ability to trade.'
A recent British Bankers' Association (BBA) guidance note, Surviving a
Disaster, asserts: 'Contingency planning is essential, not optional, and
should be budgeted for accordingly.' This sentiment is equally applicable to
all business sectors. However, evidence suggests that such advice has yet
not been fully heeded. In 1993, Keith Hearnden, a lecturer in security
management at Loughborough University, surveyed the ability of
organisations' contingency plans to cope with a disaster striking computer
systems. Based on 421 responses his analysis shows that, while awareness of
the need for contingency planning is high, in practice plan implementation,
scope and effectiveness often leave much to be desired.
The survey results indicated that 43 per cent of respondents had no
contingency plan, 20 per cent had untested plans, and 15 per cent had
'doubtful' plans. Just 22 per cent had contingency plans that were termed
'viable.' The overall figures hide wide variations between industry sectors.
For example, viable plans were found among 63 per cent of gas, electricity
and water utilities, but only 14 per cent of local authorities and computer
services businesses (such as software houses and systems bureaux).
In publishing these results, IBM UK noted: 'The research paints a gloomy
picture of the viability of recovery plans in British organisations.' IBM's
report adds: 'Many so-called business recovery plans stay in the IT
department.' Information technology systems are increasingly important given
the widespread distribution of computing power throughout organisations.
However, a focus on IT systems, or any other individual operational area, is
unlikely to lead to effective contingency planning.
As Charles Shaw, director of business continuity consultancy at Safetynet,
says: 'Having a plan solely for an IT department is like having a fire
escape half way down the side of a building.' Leo Gibbons, associate
director of Sedgwick Bankrisk, agrees: 'Contingency plans must address the
effect of an incident on the continuity of the business as a whole. For
example, having a hot-site standby computer facility up and running within a
few hours may not be of much use if the appropriate staff, command structure
and communication links are not in place.'
However, in recent years computer disaster recovery services have broadened
their scope and are now largely indistinguishable from contingency planning,
or business continuity planning, disciplines which have developed in a wider
risk management context.
In its guide to disaster recovery action planning, MRC Business Information
Group notes the change in emphasis: 'In the past such planning has focused
on computer installations. (Now it must deal) with the many aspects of
organisational life: management, personnel, insurance, communications,
buildings and building services.'
However, as the Loughborough University results highlight, the application
of broader contingency planning is not widespread. Mr Gibbons says that,
apart from a focus on IT, other factors which can make contingency plans
less than fully effective include: 'Lack of testing or staff training,
failure to regularly audit plans to make sure they address changing threats,
and too little attention being paid to longer term recovery.' Often the
initial imperative which pulls an organisation together during a disastrous
incident is difficult to sustain after a few months.
An extreme example of plan failure followed the Bishopsgate bomb in the City
of London in April 1993. One City firm found that it was unable to implement
its contingency plan because the sole copy was in the senior partner's safe
in a building within an area cordoned-off by police.
Andrew King, who as director of loss adjusters Thomas Howell Group has
first-hand experience of numerous disastrous incidents, notes four
implications of such an event: 'It arrives suddenly and is unanticipated; it
poses novel problems in which the enterprise has little prior experience;
failure to respond implies either a critical financial reversal or loss of a
significant opportunity; and the response must be urgent and cannot be
handled promptly by normal business systems and procedure.'
Contingency planning involves developing and implementing systems and
procedures to enable that response to be made. It requires high-level
commitment. Mr Shaw points out that Safetynet's contingency planning
consultancy requires a client to appoint an 'executive sponsor' to guarantee
its commitment to the project. As MRC's Mr Fleming says: 'Contingency
planning must have the commitment of the senior management of an
organisation. Those involved in a business, who know it best, must formulate
their own contingency planning. A consultant cannot do it for them, but can
catalyse and help direct the planning process.'
Contingency planning involves more than simply writing a plan. Mr Gibbons
says: 'Four phases are required:
Review of hazards facing an organisation, and assessment of their potential
business impacts;
Development, maintenance, auditing, and testing of the contingency plans;
Crisis management - implementation of plans during an incident and its
immediate aftermath;
Recovery to normal business operations.'
It is important that the first two phases are revisited regularly: hazards
and their potential impacts will change over time, and contingency plans
must evolve in response. As Mr King says: 'The plans must be living
documents that reflect changes in the business environment.' Often the
outcome of the planning process will be a series of plans relating to
departments or operational areas, managed within the context of an overall
strategic plan.
In the event of a crisis developing, the contingency plans will detail the
make-up of recovery teams and the tasks that need to be carried out.
Employees need to be informed and directed. Key services must be maintained,
and alternative or stand-by facilities brought on line where needed.
Communication with customers and suppliers is essential, as is handling of
the media. In a high profile incident, the reputation of a company may rest
on the comments made by spokespersons.
Contingency planning is applicable regardless of the size of an
organisation, or its field of business. Numerous sources of advice and
assistance are available. Insurers, insurance brokers, risk consultants,
loss adjusters, loss assessors, and chartered surveyors all provide
consultancy on contingency planning and the use of third-party recovery
services.
Specialist consultants in the field include: Continuity Planning Associates
(CPA), Safetynet, Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services (CDRS), IBM Business
Recovery Services, Datashield, Computer Disaster Recovery, MRC, Safetynet,
and Stralis among many others. Some provide software products to assist
clients with the contingency planning process: RecoveryPAC from CPA, ComPAS
from CDRS, Crisis] from Richmond Risk Management, and TRPS from Ai
Cambridge, for example.
It is too late to address contingency planning after a crisis has occurred.
As Mr King says: 'No-one plans to fail, they just fail to plan.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (7): Bermuda is top domicile -
Captives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NAOMI CAINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gone are the days when a risk manager set up a captive during the hard
insurance market when rates were high, only to let it rot when the market
softened. Gone, too, are the days when a UK risk manager could afford to
establish a captive in Bermuda in order to qualify for an annual jaunt to
its temperate climate. So where are today's most popular captive domiciles
and why?
Bermuda is the favourite among US parents and remains the international king
of captive domiciles. Tillinghast Captive Insurance Company Reports lists
1,173 captives in the island in 1993, way ahead of the next in line - the
Cayman Islands with 360. Bermuda's registrar of companies, Mr Malcolm
Butterfield, has overseen an influx of property catastrophe reinsurance
companies over the past 12 months which he believes enhances the reputation
of Bermuda's captives. But the island is already overcrowded and Mr
Butterfield predicts only moderate growth in captive numbers in the future.
The top 100 UK companies place Bermuda second on their list of domiciles.
The Isle of Man tops the list with 24 captives, thanks largely to its
proximity to mainland Britain and its established credentials. Guernsey
recently changed its tax laws for the benefit of UK parents and comes in
third place with 19 captives. Guernsey's proven willingness to accommodate
the needs of UK parents make it a captive domicile to watch. According to
Tillinghast, it scooped first prize for net gain on the captive register in
1993.
But captive domiciles do not come in and out of vogue like hemlines. 'The
choice of domicile depends first and foremost on the location of the parent
company. Other selection criteria include accessibility, political and
economic stability, captive start-up and operating costs and the domicile's
regulatory and fiscal regimes,' says Mr Roderick Strutt, managing director
of Sedgwick Management Services. Wary risk managers also look to the
domicile's track record and credibility for support.
'A UK parent will, more often than not, establish a captive in the Isle of
Man or Guernsey. A US company automatically heads for Bermuda or the Cayman
Islands, the French feel more at home in Luxembourg and the Japanese incline
towards Singapore,' explains Ms Christine Douse, director of Willis Corroon
Europe Limited and the doyenne of the captive community. There are more than
30 listed captive domiciles, from Turks and Caicos to Tennessee, and Ms
Douse warns newcomers and hopefuls of the difficulties of gaining a firm
foothold in a saturated market. 'Malta is currently trying to drum up
support, but what can it offer a UK company that is not already available
closer to home?' she asks.
Dublin burst into the captive arena in the late 1980s and has drawn 87
captives, only two of which have UK parents, although a UK-parented group
captive is in the pipeline. A Dublin captive can apply for a direct writing
licence and gain access to the EC insurance market and promoters of the
centre proclaim this facility as the way forward.
Mr Paul Cronin, manager of the Financial Services Programme at the
Industrial Development Authority of Ireland, says: 'It is now part of North
American culture that a direct licence in Dublin is the way to cover
European risks.' Heinz, McDonald's and Coca-Cola bear him out. But a direct
licence gets a lukewarm reception in the UK. 'UK companies already enjoy
purchasing freedom, so a direct licence may be of little benefit. Captives
that follow the direct route should also remember that what they save on
fees paid to a fronting insurer, they may spend on claims handling and
customer service,' warns Ms Douse.
US companies are pioneers of the move onshore. Successful locations such as
Vermont are tempting risk managers to keep the captive native. Vermont made
room for 23 new captives in 1993, including the prestigious Pepsi-Cola,
bringing its total to 240.
Mr Crawford Paul, executive director of Willis Corroon Europe Ltd, is
enthusiastic about the development but cautions risk managers not to drop
their business objectives as they jump on to the bandwagon. 'An onshore
captive is more expensive to set up and run than an offshore captive. Its
licensing and operating procedures are also complex.' But an onshore captive
eliminates fronting fees and ceding commission and allows the parent to
exploit double tax treaties.
Risk managers also use onshore captives as a weapon in their fight for
greater parental control. 'Captives that write parent company business and
spend more than Pounds 3m on premiums and companies that write customer
insurance programmes - both should take a look at the onshore alternative',
advises Mr Paul.
Customer risks are the boom market of the 1990s. In the ceaseless search for
new sources of revenue, manufacturers are marketing customer warranty,
credit and maintenance and service contracts that are underwritten by a
captive. The market breathed a collective sigh of relief when the High Court
recently ruled in favour of Thorn EMI and Granada, wiping VAT from service
and maintenance contracts and saving them Pounds 50m of VAT on insurance
premiums for all risks and breakdown cover. According to the latest figures,
their onshore captive, Consumer Electronics Insurance, writes an annual
premium income of around Pounds 17m.
If customer risks are the wunderkind of the 1990s, employee benefits should
come into their own as the millennium nears. The gradual erosion of the
welfare state has placed the responsibility for life insurance and
healthcare firmly on the shoulders of the country's employers, but only a
small percentage bring a captive into play on the employee benefits field.
The Cayman Islands welcomed their first employee benefits captive in 1993
and Dublin is aggressively marketing its ability to handle employee benefits
risks.
Captive domiciles bask in the glory of the parent company country. Bermuda
and the Cayman Islands benefit from the size and sophistication of the US
market and Guernsey and the Isle of Man owe much of their success to the
captive tradition in the UK. Continental Europe has resisted the call of the
captive, but there are signs that this is changing. The rise in German
insurance rates is motivating a number of companies to consider establishing
a captive.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (5): Directors rush for shelter -
Liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY DOWDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmental liability and employers' liability may be the hot issues for
companies in the Nineties but they face many other liabilities equally
difficult to handle. Directors' and officers' liability (D &amp; O), public
liability, and product liability are all areas where there has been an
increase in litigation and awards, or out-of-court settlements.
The problem for companies and their insurers is that liability claims are
subject to the whim of the courts, and awards, especially personal injury,
are rising.
One of the most noticeable trends recently has been the increasing liability
of directors, who are being sued alongside their companies. Greenpeace, for
example, began a campaign to single out directors of polluting companies.
The first recourse of a director is a D &amp; O insurance policy which provides
cover for claims made against directors for wrongful acts or trading, and
defence costs. According to the latest Wyatt UK D &amp; O survey (with 123
responses, admittedly only a small sample) 62 per cent of respondents had
insurance cover (compared to 84 per cent in the much larger US survey).
D &amp; O insurance claims give a good idea of the growing incidence of claims
against directors and the source of those claims. The Wyatt survey shows
that 26 per cent of participants have experienced at least one claim in the
past 10 years, compared to 1991 when the figure was 17 per cent. Claims were
brought by employees or former employees (32 per cent), competitors (21 per
cent), shareholders (21 per cent) and government bodies/regulators (18 per
cent).
Martin Beagley, of Willis Corroon, says the main exposure is in the US:
'There have been more claims in the last six months than there have been in
the last six years, and most are employment-related, coming from large UK
multinationals operating in the US.'
In the US claims from shareholders account for nearly 50 per cent of all D &amp;
O claims, and inadequate financial disclosure claims are on the increase
while claims from merger and acquisition activity, from where the majority
of UK claims stem, have fallen.
The D &amp; O insurance market is very competitive with new capacity coming in,
and the old participants refocusing, so that while there has been an
increase in claims, the premiums are still relatively cheap.
There are some exclusions in D &amp; O policies, including dishonesty or fraud,
except where there is a successful defence, product liability and libel or
slander. More importantly, most policies specifically exclude pollution,
whether gradual or sudden and accidental. However, a specific D &amp; O
pollution policy was launched recently by AIG.
The Cadbury Report has had a profound effect upon directors and has
certainly increased the awareness of directors of the liabilities they face.
Similarly, the well-known recent scandals involving directors have helped to
concentrate the mind of directors on their potential liabilities, and,
indeed, the threat of a heavy fine, or even imprisonment, may be driving
risk management within companies. At the very least, it can be used by risk
managers to bring risk management to the attention of senior management. As
Liz Taylor, risk manager at Harrison &amp; Crossfield, points out: 'I think that
risk managers should use all the incentives that they can, and personal
incentives for managers are a very useful tool.'
Public liability insurance (PL) provides protection for companies against
financial loss stemming from third party personal injury or property claims,
and, as with most liability insurance, claims are on the increase. Since
1991, PL policies have included gradual pollution exclusion wordings, but
they still offer cover for sudden and accidental pollution, though most in
the industry now feel this will not be the case for much longer.
In contrast to the relaxed attitude to pollution liability, many PL policies
in the energy field now exclude third party liability in cases involving
electromagnetic fields (EMF), in spite of there being no case history or
proven liability.
The 1985 EC Directive on Liability for Defective Products (which resulted in
the Consumer Protection Act in the UK in 1987) imposed a regime of strict
liability, which, combined with the growing 'deep-pocket' approach to
claims, has driven greater risk management among manufacturers. And the
forthcoming EC General Product Safety Directive will impose new
responsibilities to encourage risk assessment and prevention.
While awards escalate in the US, the UK product liability market is
relatively stable. This is partly because there simply are not the huge
awards in UK courts that are found in the US. The biggest claims in the UK
occur in the pharmaceutical or chemicals industries. These industries are
normally only able to obtain cover on a claims-made basis, but for other
industries there is little problem in getting cover on an occurrence basis.
Paul Maynard, technical director in the UK division of Minet, the
international insurance broker, says that in 1985/86 insurers, where their
insureds had a US exposure, tried to force all policies towards claims-made
wordings, but the attempt was short-lived. He adds: 'The commercial market
today could be described as hard, though it is not as bad as in 1986. There
may not be big reductions at renewals, but it is not difficult to find good
quality capacity.'
While product liability may not be a problem area for companies, D &amp; O looks
set to be a significant problem if the UK follows the US example. According
to the Wyatt survey in the US, the average D &amp; O claim last year was Dollars
3.25m, with shareholder claims averaging Dollars 5.4m.
Douglas McBean, a D &amp; O specialist with Minet, sounds a note of caution for
European companies which are listed on US stock exchanges, or which are
considering doing so: 'Used to the relatively lax reporting requirements in
the UK and mainland Europe, many companies are caught unawares regarding the
stringent rules of disclosure of information to shareholders and regulators
in the US. Plaintiff lawyers and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)
have not been reticent in exercising their powers.'
Many will say that it is only the US's contingency fee system that inflates
liability claims, and that it will never happen on the same scale in the UK.
But be warned: there is considerable pressure to bring in some form of
contingency fee litigation in the UK.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (4): Ways of limiting the cost of
a calamity - Business interruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON REYNOLDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In March 1993, a fire struck the plant of wallpaper manufacturer Gallery
Home Fashions at Caerphilly in south Wales. Nearly half of the 42,000 square
feet building was destroyed, including the stock areas and the office block.
Some of the machinery was damaged beyond repair and everything else in the
building was badly affected. As the company's chief executive, Martin
Paterson, says: 'After the fire we were playing for very high stakes - our
survival. Continuity of supply is vital in the wallpaper business. If we
don't fill rack space in the shops, someone else will.'
A Pounds 4.6m insurance settlement was negotiated with the assistance of
Nicholas Balcombe, chief executive of loss assessors Balcombe Group. Rather
than rebuild the factory, which would have led to production shutdown for a
significant period, it was agreed that a new plant should be built nearby.
In the meantime, with co-operation from the Health and Safety Executive
(HSE) and the building authorities, it was possible to repair the factory
sufficiently to restart some production within two weeks, concentrating on
the most profitable lines.
Over the next nine months output was built up to around two-thirds of
normal. From December 1993, production began to be transferred to the new
plant, which was officially opened in early March 1994, a year after the
fire.
Mr Paterson emphasises the importance of the initial stages: 'The momentum
we generated in the first fortnight after the fire carried us through the
longer-term recovery.'
This case shows that it is possible to successfully manage the consequences
of a serious interruption to business, through co-operation between
management, workforce, insurers, insurance brokers, loss assessors, loss
adjusters and the relevant authorities. It also highlights that rebuilding
plant is not always the best option.
It is not only large fires that interrupt business. As Andrew Dunn,
marketing manager of disaster recovery and restoration specialist Stralis,
says: 'A fairly small material damage loss can have a phenomenal business
interruption effect.' One example would be damage to a crucial high
technology machine, on which the lead time for purchase of a replacement may
be a year or more.
Laurence Law, national services director of Alexander and Alexander (UK)
Ltd, cites the case of a carpet-making machine which took three years to
replace.
Business interruption (b/i) insurance is one element in the management of
risk. It covers, during a selected indemnity period, loss of gross profit
and 'increase in cost of working', that is, costs incurred in minimising the
gross profit loss, for example, sub-contracted production, overtime payment,
temporary equipment hire, or purchase of replacement stock from alternative
suppliers at higher price. Extensions to policies can cover interruption
caused by damage at customers' or suppliers' premises, denial of access, and
other b/i risks.
Global figures for UK insurance companies (these exclude Lloyd's syndicates
results) from the Association of British Insurers (ABI), put gross incurred
b/i claims following fire at Pounds 100m in 1993, compared with Pounds 423m
for commercial property damage claims following fire. However, insurance
claims do not give the full picture. One leading insurer has written that
'the traditional problem of inadequate sums insured remains a feature of
many b/i claims.'
As Mr Balcombe says: 'Some companies manage to make good the damage and
recover quickly, supported by payment in full of their insurance claims.
Many others are not so fortunate - usually they have been under-insured.'
Many b/i policies are purchased with an indemnity period of 12-18 months,
whereas repair and rebuilding after some incidents can take much longer.
Brian Toft, risk analyst in the Risk Services Division at Sedgwick (UK),
says: 'In many cases a year is too short: it may take two or three years to
get a business up and running after a major incident. By then the trained
workforce may have disappeared, as well as customers.'
The costs of loss of reputation, or long-term loss of customers due to
inability to supply goods, are difficult to quantify. This, in addition to
underinsurance, may disguise the fact that in some cases the real cost of
business interruption can be greater than that of physical damage.
Modern business practices can lead to increased interruption risks.
Dependencies between customers and suppliers are rising. One instance is
single sourcing of components, which has advantages in terms of cost and
quality control, but can be a critical problem if the sole supplier suffers
an incident disrupting supply.
An extreme example of problems associated with concentrated sourcing is a
fire in 1993 that destroyed a plant in western Japan which produced 60 per
cent of the world's output of a resin used in semiconductor devices. Such
problems can be compounded by business methods such as just-in-time, where
raw material and finished goods stocks are kept to a minimum.
High capacity plant gives advantages of economies of scale. Concentrating a
higher volume of production into a more compact area also heightens the
potential extent of damage and consequent interruption in the event of a
disaster. Similarly, widespread reliance of many businesses on computer
systems, increases the potential consequences of computer failure.
There is a wealth of experience within the risk management profession to
help businesses cope with these business interruption risks, both pre-loss
prevention and post-loss mitigation. Roger Ricketts, technical manager of
property services in Sun Alliance International's Risk Improvement and
Survey Department, says the emphasis must be on prevention: 'Having b/i
insurance does not guarantee you won't go out of business. An important part
of our work is to give advice on contingency planning, and risk
identification, assessment and control.'
Also of significance are hidden costs - sometimes called 'iceberg' costs -
associated with accidents in the workplace. These are not generally termed
business interruption events, but looked at in the broad risk management
context can have the same effect. For instance, if an accident occurs on a
production line or individual machine, output might have to be shut down for
a period. John Hurrell, managing director of Sedgwick Global, notes that
other hidden costs can stem, for example, from management time spent in
investigating an incident, difficulties in hiring skilled replacement
workers, and less tangible elements such as the effect on morale or damage
to reputation.
As Barry Holt, manager of Liberty Risk Services, says: 'Our research, and
that of bodies like the HSE, shows the value of addressing the top of the
accident 'iceberg'. Our role is to identify and assess workplace risks, and
then reduce or eliminate them, with the aim of preventing accidents from
occurring in the first place.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (3): Call for an integrated
approach - Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past five years, environmental liability has gained importance in
risk management circles throughout the world. A barrage of laws and
regulations on everything from pesticides to packaging waste has turned what
was once regarded as routine spillage or emission into actionable nuisances
or even criminal offences.
Anyone doubting the momentum of this trend should look at a snapshot of
activity worldwide:
The European Union is debating new liability rules under its Green Paper on
Remedying Environmental Damage;
The Strasbourg-based Council of Europe has agreed a convention on liability
for damage resulting from activities dangerous to the environment;
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is developing a liability
protocol under the Basel Convention on cross-border movements of hazardous
waste;
The UK government has just published its preliminary thoughts on liability
for contaminated land;
The French environment ministry has circulated all departments and regions
with instructions to begin preparation of inventories of contaminated sites;
The governments of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, as
well as regional governments in Spain and Italy, are promoting tougher
liability and clean-up proposals;
In the US, Congress is examining proposals to update both the Superfund
hazardous substance clean-up law, CERCLA, and the Clean Water Act;
In Canada and Australia, individual states and provinces are developing new
strict liability regimes;
Even in Japan, the recently passed Basic Environmental Law and some local
city ordinances are opening the way for new liability provisions.
At the same time, the environmental enforcement agencies and powers at
national and international level are being strengthened, with a third
biannual international enforcement conference to be held in Oaxaca, Mexico,
next month.
The uncomfortable paradox is that, just as environmental regulations
proliferate and liability increases, the insurance market has been
restricting or removing cover for environmental risks. Courts in the US have
been upholding hundreds of high value claims for Superfund and other
clean-up costs, under general liability policies that were either silent on
pollution or attempted to limit cover to 'sudden and accidental', as opposed
to gradual, incidents. As a result, insurers have been re-wording their
general policies to narrow the range of pollution incidents covered.
Conversely, a small number of insurers, including insurance market pools in
certain European countries, now offer specialist environmental insurance
policies to cover a variety of risks, including environmental impairment
(third party) liability (EIL), own-site clean-up, and contractors' risks,
directors' and officers' risks (D&amp;O), and professional indemnity (PI) risks.
These new policies are generally based on 'claims made' (as opposed to
'occurrence') policy wordings, require intensive site surveys before cover
is offered, have modest policy limits (typically Pounds 1-Pounds 10m) and
involve substantial deductibles (the amount paid by the policy holder in any
loss). They require payment of premiums which many potential policy holders
consider high, particularly when they have had environmental cover free in
the past. In addition, they offer little cover for damage caused in the
past, to the extent that such cover simply will not be available to many
existing industrial facilities.
As Richard Turrin, of AIG Europe (UK) Ltd, one of the providers of such
insurance, puts it: 'You can't insure a car after it has crashed.' On the
other hand, he points out, sites subject to a properly documented clean-up
may become insurable again and, in another context, companies inviting
contractors or consultants on to their sites may well want to ensure that
these intruders are adequately covered for any environmental damage they do
in the course of their work.
Caught in this pincer movement of tightening regulation and narrowing
insurance cover, risk managers are developing more sophisticated packages of
measures to handle environmental risks.
Nick Chipman, managing director of Sedgwick Environmental Services in
London, believes that EIL policies are too limited to be of much use to many
clients. He hopes to see more 'customer-friendly' insurance products emerge
from discussions with interested insurers. At the same time, he is keen to
encourage clients to get their own operations into a condition that will
make them more insurable.
Some companies, he says, publicise corporate environmental policies without
doing enough to implement them. He also sees a complacency in countries such
as the UK where 'sudden and accidental' pollution cover can still be
obtained free under public liability policies. Mr Chipman argues that buying
specialist environmental policies can increase the inherent value of a
business by acting as a kind of certificate of assurance on its commitment
to good environmental management.
Beyond that, Mr Chipman recommends that all clients at risk dig out their
old liability policies, often written on an 'occurrence' basis (ie with
cover remaining open indefinitely for incidents occurring during the period
of the policy), which he sees as an asset against which potential
liabilities can be offset. Where there is no insurance to rely upon, he
points to a range of alternative risk financing mechanisms, which allow
companies to put money aside on a regular basis towards possible future
liabilities. The key, he says, is to have an integrated approach to all the
options available.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (2): Capacity crunch looms -
Employers' liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers' liability (EL) used to be seen as a relatively easy class of risk
to manage - for insurers and industry. But since the Piper Alpha disaster in
1988, which sent a tidal wave of claims through the market, businesses are
finding EL protection increasingly expensive and often difficult to place.
As a result, a radical shake-up in the way EL risk is managed and insured is
now under way.
If Piper Alpha shocked direct writers and reinsurers into reducing their
exposure to EL insurance business, a steady increase in the cost of claims
over the past 20 years had already become a growing concern for EL insurers
such as Eagle Star. The leading UK EL underwriter has worked out that the
average cost of EL claims has risen by 15 times in the past two decades and
is still growing.
Against a background of 800 per cent inflation over the same period, claims
for total disablement have risen by 1,500 per cent (from an average of
Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 750,000) and claims for minor injuries increased
1,250 per cent (from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,250). Besides injury claims,
losses incurred by insurers from occupational disease claims have also grown
and now represent about 50 per cent of all EL claims, compared to less than
20 per cent 10 years ago.
In addition to the relentless march of claims in 'traditional' categories,
such as deafness or loss of limb, new heads of claim emanating from
white-collar employees are adding to insurers' woes.
Repetitive strain injuries, stress and the effects of passive smoking are
rated the claims of the future as trade unions find success, if not with
judge and jury, then in out-of-court settlements.
In the face of such formidable claims attrition, insurers have been led by
those reinsurers which remain in the market to increase rates and limit the
scope of cover offered businesses. Rate increases of 30 per cent annually
are now commonplace and as much as 100 per cent, not unusual.
Furthermore, for the first time, industry risk managers approach their EL
renewals this year with limits attached to their policies. By law, a company
must purchase a minimum of Pounds 2m - but from January 1, 1995, a limit of
Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m per policy is likely to be imposed by insurers, instead
of the unlimited cover companies have traditionally enjoyed. The situation
will be further complicated if the government raises the statutory minimum
level of cover, as some observers expect it to soon.
But worries in industry run even deeper: 'The limit of indemnity is a red
herring really,' says Ray Mattholie, risk manager at telecommunications
giant BT and head of the AIRMIC working group into EL. 'There are not so
many companies which need to worry about catastrophic exposures. The cap is
simply a symptom of the shrinking market for EL cover: there is just no
interest in writing new business in the market,' he says.
It is this lack of availability, especially to non-manufacturing businesses,
which will lead to changes in the way EL protections are organised,
according to Mr Mattholie. Fundamental changes to the basis on which cover
is underwritten, away from occurrence to claims made, to reduce the 'long
tail' of policies, for example, would require a change in the law governing
employers' liability. Similarly, companies increasing their retention of
exposure could be contravening existing law which stipulates the amount of
cover a company must purchase. 'More companies employ alternative risk
financing than you might think and it is a nonsense that they have to hide
it away,' says Mr Mattholie. 'Some of these companies are more viable than
their insurers.'
An even more radical solution being proposed by some risk managers is the
adoption of a US workers' compensation type of scheme in the UK. In the US,
awards are made through a standard 'no-fault' procedure of fixed benefit
levels and not through the courts. Premium rating for EL plans have to be
approved by the individual states, which are responsible for overseeing
their own systems.
Eagle Star's Derek Howie, assistant liability manager, is not convinced: 'To
follow the American lead would be to introduce an expensive problem for UK
industry,' he says, pointing to the difficulties the US system is facing.
Mr Howie concedes that the UK Act could be looked at again to accommodate
the element of 'self-insurance' which some companies require - the use of
large deductibles or a captive, for example - but stresses that the Act is
designed to protect employees: 'There is nothing fundamentally wrong with
English common law - the present system works well - what is needed is a
board-led assault on the appalling accident rate in our companies.'
But brokers are bringing some risk engineering to bear on EL problems. Risk
sharing is advocated by Ron Hayes, director of international risk management
at Bowring Marsh &amp; McLennan, because it encourages insurers to make cover
available and without exclusion.
Larger clients are increasingly using their captives to insure part of their
EL risk, Mr Hayes says. The insurer issues policies providing for full cover
but reinsures 'predictable' losses to the company's captive. Even smaller
companies should find that taking a sizeable deductible produces savings.
Assigning the deductible to operating companies will concentrate managers'
minds on properly managing EL risk, Mr Hayes adds.
Sedgwick UK has introduced an EL risk auditing service which it says helps
reduce incidents and claims. It charges a set fee to analyse previous
claims, assess the risks a company is exposed to, design a risk management
plan to reduce them and negotiate a premium based on the improved risk
exposure.
Self-financing deals allow a risk manager to take control of the EL
programme but do not always assure great premium savings, warns Sedgwick
UK's casualty director James Hopper.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (1): Business takes cover - The
risks companies face are becoming more complicated. Rising premiums and
shrinking protection have forced commercial buyers to rethink their approach
and to seek alternative methods of insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
'Every time there is a disaster people say how could it happen to us. How
can we be vulnerable?' Geoff Saunders, risk manager of RTZ, observes when
explaining the recent growth of risk management - a combination of loss
control, risk financing and self-insurance techniques which is becoming
increasingly popular with larger British companies.
Mr Saunders points to the growing number of leading corporations backing the
British insurance and risk managers' association, Airmic, whose annual
conference opens today, as evidence of growing boardroom interest.
Mr Saunders, who is also Airmic's chairman, says more and more commercial
buyers are examining alternative ways of insuring their property, legal
liabilities and other risks.
Companies are increasing the amount of risk they retain on their own books
by, for example, accepting larger deductibles. Additionally, many are
forming 'captive' insurance subsidiaries which are dedicated to insuring
their own risks and allowing direct access to the reinsurance market.
Figures from Tillinghast, the actuaries and management consultants, show
that the number of British captives has more than doubled since 1987, rising
from 118 to 325. The number of captives owned by companies in the FTSE 250,
the biggest companies in terms of market capitalisation, has nearly tripled
since 1987, rising from 52 to 148. Recently privatised utilities have
embraced the trend with particular enthusiasm.
This trend runs parallel to another development: the rise in popularity of
financial risk management techniques such as the use of derivatives to cover
interest and currency exposures.
Advocates of risk management have long argued that by increasing spending on
safety and accident reduction and by setting up their own insurance
arrangements, companies can reduce overall spending on insurance and improve
their bottom line.
'Companies want to have their own access to the commercial and reinsurance
insurance market, without having to pay for the overheads which insurance
groups carry,' explains Alan Fleming, risk manager of ICI and executive
director of Airmic. 'Why go to these guys when you can go directly to the
real risk-takers who have much more capacity. This is the real driving force
for captives,'
In the UK, these traditional arguments, which helped fuel the initial rise
of the captive movement in the 1950s and 1960s, have been reinforced by two
recent trends.
First, a spate of expensive international disasters in the past 10 years
including the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea in 1988
and the IRA bomb blasts in the City in 1992 and 1993, have provided graphic
reminders of the range of risks to which the corporate world is exposed.
Second, sudden and unexpected increases in prices and restrictions in
insurance cover, have led many companies to question the traditional answers
offered by the conventional insurance market.
A number of insurers, for example, have reduced their involvement in classes
such as motor fleet and employers' liability, as a result of steep rises in
claims costs.
The market for employers' liability could contract further early next year
if reinsurers go ahead, as expected, with plans to limit the cover they
offer.
Companies excluded terrorism cover as a standard feature of property
insurance policies, after the IRA bomb in April 1992. Business is now
largely dependent on terrorism policies sold by Pool Re, an industry-owned
mutual whose losses are ultimately guaranteed by the government, and there
have been widespread protests about the increased costs. In some cases
London-based companies are paying as much for their terrorism policies as
they pay for the rest of their property insurance.
Mr Fleming concedes that insurers were under pressure from their own
reinsurers to withdraw but says: 'It is worrying that the market overreacts
to the unusual. A vibrant market would see this as an opportunity rather
than a problem.'
Another area, pollution, has also been a cause for concern. Insurers
excluded protection against gradual pollution from all liability policies in
1991 but there are fears in some quarters that cover for sudden and
accidental damage could also be excluded for standard public liability
policies over the next few years.
Mr Saunders says that the market's stance on pollution reflects a more
general unease about long-tail liability risks - in which claims typically
emerge many years after the inception of a policy.
The withdrawal from the market of the ninth biggest UK insurance company,
Municipal Mutual, in the autumn of 1992, and the disappearance of dozens of
smaller London companies has highlighted yet another worry  - the security
of underlying policies. Municipal Mutual insured relatively small amounts of
commercial business but was hard hit by liability claims from the local
authorities which owned the company.
'When you think you've laid off risk and you find out you really haven't
because your insurer goes belly up it is a concern,' says Mr Saunders.
As buyers respond to these developments there are signs that the UK and, to
a lesser extent, the rest of Europe are following a well-established North
American trend. There, more than a third of insurance premiums have been
diverted from the conventional insurance market towards a so-called
alternative market populated by captive insurance subsidiaries and other
self-insurance facilities, such as risk retention groups.
'Europe is a decade and a half behind the US,' says Joe Smetana, chairman of
risk management at American International Group, a company which was quick
off its feet in anticipating the risk management trend.
As well as selling a range of conventional products, AIG is now a leading
provider of claims management, loss control and other services for the
alternative or self-insurance market.
Mr Smetana says that the contraction of the liability market, initially for
product liability and medical malpractice risks in the mid-1970s, fuelled
the growth of the alternative market which had begun in the 1950s.
Subsequently, further tightening in liability classes in the mid-1980s
boosted the development of the alternative market, including the formation
of significant Bermudian high-level liability insurance facilities, such as
ACE and XL.
Most of this business has been lost by the conventional market, a
development which could have far-reaching ramifications for North American
insurers.
The traditional insurance market cycles - in which premium rates fluctuate
along with the amount of capital moving in and out of the industry - are
expected to become less pronounced, or even, a thing of the past.
'For four years everyone has been saying the hard market is coming. It
hasn't. Quite honestly one of the main reasons is because of the alternative
market,' says Mr Paul Brown, director of public affairs at the Risk and
Insurance Management Society, the US risk managers' association. He says
that 83 per cent of the Fortune 1000 top US corporations are members of RIMS
and the organisation is now increasing its representation among medium-sized
companies.
Some analysts expect the US alternative market to absorb 50 per cent of
premiums by 2000 and predict that a growing number of European industrial
customers will follow suit, especially if deregulation and liberalisation of
the European markets lead to increases in premiums for commercial risks.
Bigger insurance brokers, especially those whose interests span the
Atlantic, are anticipating the trend, increasingly earning fees from risk
management advice and services as well commission income on policies.
But the trend could represent a further blow for those UK and European
insurance companies who are too slow to respond.
Some may be losing many of their most significant commercial customers to
self-insurance. For an industry already besieged by the banks and new direct
telephone-based insurers in areas such as motor, home and life insurance
that could be bad news.

FRANKFURT
BHF Bank reports on Wednesday, with analysts looking for a rise in operating
profits of around 20 per cent. Hoare Govett expects that further growth in
profits this year will not be fully matched at the earnings level after the
bank's recent rights issue. Full-year figures come from Deutsche Bank on
Thursday. The broker expects a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, after
extraordinary items, in spite of the bank's steep increase in allocations to
risk provisioning.

Ciba, which last week launched an application to produce a low-cost version
of Glaxo's Zantac ulcer medication in the US, is due to outline full-year
sales and profit figures tomorrow. The chemicals and pharmaceuticals
reiterated its forecast of an increase in net income for the full year when
it unveiled an 8.3 per cent upturn in sales in the third quarter. Jelmoli,
the leading department store group, is due to report tomorrow, with analysts
expecting net profits up almost 200 per cent. Forbo, the floor and wall
coverings group, reports today and Bobst, the packaging machinery group,
produces 1993 figures tomorrow, as does Lindt &amp; Sprungli, the fine-chocolate
group.
AMSTERDAM
Full-year figures are due from ING tomorrow. The financial services group
predicted a 'moderate increase' in full-year profits per share when it
reported an 11 per cent increase in net profit for the first nine months.
Aegon, the Netherlands' second largest insurance company, reports on
Thursday. Consensus estimates are for a 5 per cent fall in net annual
profits.
MILAN
The country will be spending a second day at the polls today. But even after
the outcome of the election becomes known, many analysts expect it could be
several weeks before the final composition of a new coalition government
becomes clear. Rinascente, Italy's largest retailer, reports today.
TOKYO
Investors are bracing themselves for a volatile week as the business year
ends on Thursday. Companies are expected to continue profit-taking to
support dwindling profits while the prospect of higher interest rates
following the plunge in the bond markets is undermining confidence.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Wall Street's list of woes grows longer -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While a second rise in short-term interest rates was never an appealing
prospect for Wall Street, there was a certain comfort to be drawn from the
predictability of the Federal Reserve last week. Unfortunately, the Fed's
seemingly inevitable move, which came as expected on Tuesday, failed to
dispel the uncertainty which has depressed share prices since monetary
policy began to shift in early February.
Indeed, the sources of the market's unease seem to have multiplied. Mexico's
political stability, President Clinton's political standing, tensions with
North Korea and higher commercial lending rates are now competing with
rising bond yields to top the list of Wall Street's worries.
As a consequence, analysts say the odds are poor that stocks will make an
early recovery from last week, when the bellwether Dow industrial index
showed a net decline of 120 points.
'In the near term, the market is stuck at roughly the current levels,' says
Mr Steven Einhorn, equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He sees
the correction in the 'ageing bull market' (now down 5.1 per cent from its
peak of 3,978 on January 31) continuing until it becomes apparent that the
slide in the bond market is complete.
The persistent influence of bonds on share prices was underlined on Friday.
A relatively tranquil session on the NYSE ended in a rout when the yield on
the benchmark 30-year government bond climbed above the 7 per cent barrier
in the late afternoon. The return on the long bond has stayed below that
level for the past 10 months.
The sell-off in stocks was all the more discouraging because the immediate
impact of the Fed's tightening was mild. Earlier fears of a sharp downturn
seemed exaggerated after Wednesday's close. But the sense of relief quickly
evaporated with Thursday's 48-point plunge, set off by the shot which killed
the leading candidate for the Mexican presidency.
Perhaps the best hope of a rally this week lies in the approach of a long
holiday weekend, which traditionally brings improved share prices.
This year, however, the Easter calendar raises an unusual set of
circumstances which could very well work against the market. Although
trading screens will stay quiet on Friday, the wheels of the federal
bureaucracy will churn out the important economic news of the month - the
March employment figures.
Mr Anthony O'Bryan, market strategist at A. G. Edwards of St Louis, expects
investors to be anticipating Friday's figure earlier in the week. 'There
will be more people trying to protect themselves against a bad number than
people trying to capitalise on a good one,' he fears.
The consensus forecast of Wall Street analysts is a 200,000 gain in non-farm
payrolls. Anticipation of a stronger than expected reading could rattle the
inflation-sensitive Treasury market, and stocks are likely to follow.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Challenge to SEs from futures on individual
shares - Risk &amp; Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's stock exchanges, which have been slow to jump into the
derivatives fray, may find a fresh challenge at their flanks if London's
Liffe and the Sydney Futures Exchange are successful in their plans to
launch futures contracts on individual shares.
Trading futures on individual equities is specifically prohibited in the US
under a 12-year-old accord between the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the US securities regulator, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the primary futures regulator.
The SEC and CFTC decided to prohibit these instruments in 1982, while
allowing the creation of futures on broad-based stock indices. The SEC
feared that futures on individual shares would open the door to price
manipulation.
However, institutional money managers' appetite for ways to allocate assets
efficiently and to leverage investments may force US regulators to rethink
their position if overseas equity futures contracts are successful.
Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of the Sydney Futures Exchange, believes the
time is right for futures on a limited number of well-capitalised companies
whose shares are liquid and actively traded. 'These products would be an
alternative to buying and selling individual shares. Futures are cheaper,
more efficient and allow more leverage,' he says.
Mr Hosking has floated the idea of trading futures on the shares of three of
Australia's biggest companies - mining giant BHP, News Corporation and the
National Australia Bank - with the Australian Securities Commission. So far,
he says, the regulator 'hasn't raised issues that would indicate rejection'.
In London, Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive, said similar products
on a handful of UK stocks are under preliminary consideration.
If futures on individual equities catch on, they will only be suitable for
the largest companies in each country. Mr Hosking says that if his three
initial share futures contracts are a success, he could only expand the
concept to the top 10 capitalised stocks in Australia.
However, there is nothing in Australian law to stop the SFE from trading
futures on shares in companies like General Motors or reaching into emerging
markets. On the US side, 'The CFTC and the SEC might have something to say
about US customers using the products,' Mr Hosking says.
Fortunately for the SFE, the Australian companies being considered for
futures contracts have not baulked at the idea. While their blessing is not
technically necessary, their endorsement is important, Mr Hosking says. He
has spoken to all three and says they see benefits from having futures
contracts on their stock.
Analysts say that for a select group of shares, a futures contract would
offer benefits over existing options products. Liquidity in stock options is
often spread over a wide variety of strike prices and expiration dates.
Futures on shares could offer a deeper, cheaper market, with liquidity
centralised on quarterly expirations.
The share futures being considered by the SFE would be settled in cash,
rather than the shares themselves, making them more attractive from an
administrative standpoint than share-settled options.
Proponents say having futures on a few top companies in every country would
help investors focus their portfolios. Currently many fund managers arrange
international equity exposure by dealing in stock index futures contracts
from a variety of countries. Often the composition of these indices is
flawed, or fails to match investors' objectives. Individual share futures
would offer an alternative.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Painful spell ahead for fund managers -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week will bring some painful experiences for fund managers as they face
up to the outcome of the first trading quarter of the year. The fall of more
than 9 per cent on the FT-SE 100 index over the quarter, and huge losses in
government bonds, is bad enough; but the percentage loss on equities rises
to nearly 12 points for those who bought at the market peak at the beginning
of February.
All these factors add to the agony caused by the underlying worries about
interest rate trends and the sudden lurch downwards on Wall Street on fears
of turmoil in Latin America.
In market terms, these prospects have already been reflected in an absence
of support at almost any price, although the underlying sentiment in
equities is less negative than the index statistics might suggest.
The big funds are simply not going to play until after Easter and the
closing of investment ledgers on the first quarter of 1994, so share prices
remain at the mercy of the global bond markets; and last week brought the
currency markets back on to the scene. There is little point in looking for
a break in the clouds before Good Friday.
The positive view on the stock market is that rising corporate dividend and
earnings trends are balancing out the swiftly fading hopes for that next cut
in base rates, on which optimism was founded at the beginning of this year.
At some stage, equities are going to make a convincing response to this
view. But when?
The stock market bounced successfully around the FT-SE 100 3,100 mark last
week, but so it did around 3,200 on several previous occasions.
Unfortunately, even after the market survives Easter, it still has to face
the political future implied by the government's low standing in the opinion
polls, the impending increases in personal taxation and the forthcoming
local and European elections.
However, Kleinwort Benson Securities believes that, given that the next UK
general election could be delayed until April 1997, political fears may have
been overdone; four years is a long time in politics.
Bargain hunters abound in these troubled conditions, and it is no surprise
that they should have concentrated on sectors inviting attention in terms of
prospective yields. The stress is on prospective rather than historic
performance, with dividend forecasts taken seriously.
Inevitably, this puts the focus
on sectors badly out of favour. Pharmaceuticals collapsed last year but are
showing an increase
in dividend growth forecasts. Glaxo, which was badly hit again last week as
Ciba-Geigy threatened a challenge to Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug, is
unlikely to languish for long.
Water stocks have taken a beating this year but are returning to favour as
investors begin to prefer dividend growth stocks to fixed interest
securities. Anglian and Wessex Water have been targeted by NatWest
Securities.

The market will open this week with investors in an unsettled mood. After
last week's initially impressive display of fortitude when the Federal
Reserve raised short-term interest rates another quarter of a point to 3.5
per cent, Wall Street had hoped that the worst of the recent sell-off was
over.
Unfortunately, bond prices were unable to build upon the big gains they
earned in the wake of the Fed's move. By Friday, the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond had climbed above 7 per cent for the first time in 10 months as
everyone started worrying about the next Fed tightening.
Over the coming days, trading is likely to be dominated by the March
employment report, which is due to be released on Friday. Just to make
matters worse, Friday is a national holiday, so the cash market will be
closed for the day. Without the opportunity to respond to the employment
data immediately, trading during the first four days of this week is likely
to be jittery.
Analysts are expecting the March jobs report to show an increase in non-farm
payrolls of about 200,000, and they foresee no change in the unemployment
rate, which was last recorded at 6.5 per cent. With market sentiment so
weak, an increase in payrolls substantially larger than 200,000 could prompt
a fresh round of heavy selling.

Gilts will struggle to find support this week after another battering from
investors. Last week's inflation figures, while not disastrous, failed to
provide the boost the market desperately needed.
While Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, is holding his monthly
monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on
Wednesday, hopes are fading that they will agree to a rate cut. The
inflation figures were simply not good enough, especially as the authorities
were perceived to have lost credibility with the timing of their February
cut.
Furthermore, sterling has been extremely weak, and a rate cut, which might
easily be perceived as political, would be poorly received by currency
traders.
Following the example of the US, the markets are already looking ahead to
the time when the authorities will have to increase rates. Prices in the
futures market imply higher rates by June.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International
(Europe), thinks this pessimism on rates is overdone. 'The gilt market is
fundamentally good value but in technical terms it is looking pretty awful,'
he says.
With no economic statistics of note, and with Easter approaching, the market
is unlikely to find it easy to rally this week.

FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Confidence in Latin America shaken -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The turmoil in Latin American markets last week following the assassination
in Mexico of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, may further test the confidence of
investors in the so-called emerging markets.
After a strong performance last year, emerging debt markets ran out of steam
at the beginning of 1994 and went into retreat.
Yield spreads of Latin American bonds over US Treasuries had already
deteriorated this year, due to fears of rising US interest rates. According
to Salomon Brothers' Brady bond index, investors made a return of 43.87 per
cent last year. Since the start of this year, the index has shown a negative
return of 14.48 per cent.
Investors had been bargain-hunting for Latin American bonds earlier in the
week, in the belief that the market was looking cheap, but news of the
assassination on Thursday sent prices of most Latin American bonds tumbling.
According to traders, most activity was in liquid benchmark issues. For
example, the yield spread on the Republic of Argentina's Dollars 1bn
offering of 10-year global bonds widened from 300 basis points over US
Treasuries before the assassination to more than 350 basis points
immediately after the news.
The spread has since narrowed to around 320 basis points and some traders
expect the spread to improve further as the market regains its poise.
By contrast, the spreads on Latin American Eurobonds denominated in D-Marks
barely moved, mainly because the majority are owned by long-term investors.
The spread on Argentina's DM1bn offering of five-year Eurobonds, which had
been launched last September at a yield spread of 250 basis points over
German government notes, stayed at around 208 basis points.
Several factors are likely to help stabilise Latin American bond prices over
the coming weeks, ranging from the Dollars 6bn credit line from the US and
Mexico's admission into the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development, the first Latin American nation to enter this influential club
of industrialised democracies. Standard &amp; Poor's swift affirmation of its
BB+ rating on Mexico's long-term dollar debt and the positive outlook on the
rating has also given the market some support.
Nevertheless, syndicate managers say the volatility in spreads over the last
week has made it virtually impossible for Latin American borrowers to gain
access to the market at the spreads they were able to command during last
year's bull run. Mr Keith Vincent, head of emerging markets syndicate at
Bankers Trust in London, says that although deals can still be done, it is
difficult to get the best pricing and distribution. 'At this moment, trying
to match previous benchmarks is not possible.'
In addition, banks which won mandates from Latin American borrowers up to
four months ago are having to go back to their clients to renegotiate the
terms and structure of the planned deals, due to the acute price movements
in the secondary market. More often than not, issuers which are not in a
hurry for the cash are choosing to delay fundraising until conditions
improve.
On Friday, Petrobras, Brazil's state oil monopoly, announced that it was
delaying the launch of a Dollars 150m issue of Eurobonds denominated in
D-Marks, which had been planned for the end of March.
But why has the assassination knocked not only the Mexican market, but other
Latin American markets, and even some apparently unassociated emerging
markets?
The fact is that Mexico, because of its strong association with the US and
its relatively advanced economic development, is viewed as a benchmark for
the rest of Latin America.
'Mexico is seen as the creme de la creme, even though it doesn't yet have an
investment grade rating,' says Mr Michael Brook, a director of West Merchant
Bank. '(The assassination) has cast a long shadow.'
Coming so soon after the rebellion in Chiapas, the assassination was seen by
some investors as showing that political risk in Mexico has deteriorated,
and the likelihood of an investment grade rating this year may have receded,
according to Mr Brook. 'Psychologically, the reaction is 'if this can happen
in Mexico, what could go wrong in Venezuela - or in Russia?'' said one
trader in secondary market debt.
Indeed, Venezuelan bonds were the worst performers among Latin American
Brady bonds last week, slipping 5 per cent compared with 3 1/2 per cent for
Mexico on Salomon's Brady bond index.
Mexican par bonds ended the week at about 70 cents on the dollar, having
dropped as low as 64 cents, following the assassination.
Paradoxically, the markets may even, in the medium term, be in better shape
now. 'The way I see the markets, we are now back at levels of a year ago.
This is fair value. The rest (of the rally) was indiscriminate money,' said
Mr Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed income at F&amp;C Emerging Markets.

Although German bonds ended Friday on a firmer note after a late
short-squeeze in the futures pits, traders are forecasting another volatile
week ahead.
With key money supply and inflation numbers out of the way for now and the
Bundesbank's central bank council away for its Easter break, the market will
have little fundamental news to focus on, leaving it vulnerable to further
turbulence in the international bond markets.
Meanwhile, after Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer's latest affirmation
that booming M3 money supply growth cannot be ignored, 'the focus will be on
how the Bundesbank will act after the M3 numbers,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an
economist at Lehman Brothers. M3 grew at an annualised rate of 17.6 per cent
in February, well above its 4 to 6 per cent target.
However, the Bundesbank is expected to continue lowering its rate for
securities repurchase agreements. It fell eight basis points to 5.80 per
cent last week.
In spite of last week's encouraging inflation data and recent moderate wage
settlements, investors remain cautious amid fears of further US interest
rate tightening. 'There's a significant amount of liquidity around that has
to return to the market - but when that will happen, no one knows,' sighed a
dealer.

FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Fears of rising inflation rattle gilts -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid continued weakness in global bond markets, UK government bonds have
continued to post the sharpest losses, rattled by fears that rising
inflation pressures may put an end to monetary easing.
Indeed, after last week's stronger than expected retail prices data, the
gilt market is increasingly pricing in a rise in short-term rates, causing
yields at the long end of the curve to soar. Moreover, weakness in global
bond markets, where traders are worrying about further US interest rate
tightening and the slow pace of German easing, is contributing to gilts'
decline.
'What is happening in gilts largely magnifies what is happening elsewhere,'
says Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysts IDEA.
According to Salomon Brothers' World Government Bond Index, global bonds
have shed 3.01 per cent in the year to date while UK bonds have fallen by
7.18 per cent in the same period. More dramatically, gilts' 10-year yield
spread over German bunds has widened from a low of 49 basis points in late
January to 155 basis points late on Friday.
At the short end, the June three-month sterling interest rate future on
Liffe is now discounting three-month rates at 5.57 per cent by mid-September
and 5.87 per cent by mid-December. Three-month money currently trades around
5.30 per cent, just above the 5.25 per cent base rate.
'What we're seeing is a burst of collective neurosis after the RPI data,'
says Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. 'To think
there's a snip of a chance that they'll put up rates is absurd - the market
is losing all track of reality.'
The easing scenario is partly complicated by political considerations, with
local elections in May and European elections in June. 'Rate cuts around
that time would look politically motivated and would hurt the market,' says
one gilts trader.
But traders have been especially worried by a recent rise in average
earnings and by the February retail prices index. The RPI was higher than
expected, with a headline rate of 2.4 per cent and an underlying rate of 2.8
per cent, against market expectations of around 2.2 per cent and 2.6 per
cent respectively.
'While we wouldn't see February's figures as radically altering the outlook
for inflation, they do make an early cut in interest rates unlikely,' argues
Mr Darren Winder, UK economist at S. G. Warburg.
But while most observers agree that the inflation data does not point to an
imminent price explosion and are likely to ease back in the summer, the
market sees the US example 'as a taste of things to come', says Mr Nigel
Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International. The US Federal
Reserve has raised its Fed Funds rate twice in the past two months to nip
simmering inflation pressures in the bud and is expected to strike again.
Most market participants feel the sell-off has been vastly overdone, but few
are willing to predict when it will end - partly because, even at these
levels, gilts elicit little buying interest. 'We have the curious situation
where investors, who usually like to buy on dips, say they'll buy when the
market goes up,' says Mr Richardson.
According to IDEA's Mr McDevitt, there is currently no point in trying to
determine the bottom of this market. 'You have to let sentiment rule,' he
says, adding that many investors are holding long gilt positions which they
hedge by selling futures against them.
In spite of scant cash selling, this has caused the futures market to drag
cash prices down further, triggering a vicious circle. 'The lower we go, the
more stop-losses are triggered,' says Midland's Mr Shepherdson.
Nevertheless, most dealers expect Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2.5bn
floating-rate gilts to go relatively smoothly, if only because the short end
of the yield curve has cheapened so much in recent days. The gilts mature in
1999 and will pay a coupon of the three-month London inter-bank bid rate
less one-eighth.
'Investors who remain convinced that UK rates have to move higher . . . will
find the issue attractive,' says Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income strategist at
Merrill Lynch. But even for investors who expect to see further rate cuts,
'the issue is likely to prove an attractive hedge to their current positions
at the short end of the yield curve, just in case rates do go up.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
While trading for March settlement has ended for the bond market, most
investors are expected to remain cautious in committing funds as the spate
of economic data announced this week is expected to reconfirm the bottoming
of the economy.
Industrial production data, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, are
expected to show a month-on-month rise for the second consecutive month. BZW
in Tokyo expects demand from sectors including electric machinery and
non-ferrous metals to support February industrial output. It predicts
production figures to rise 2 per cent from the previous month, which
translates into a 2.6 per cent fall from the same month last year, the
smallest decline since March last year.
Household expenditure for January is also forecast to show firm
month-on-month and year-on-year rises, due to increased spending on
furniture and household goods and a rise in medical care and transport
spending.
The figures come as government bonds face volatility for technical reasons.
Trading of the No 164 10-year bond has risen on expectations that it will
replace the No 157, the benchmark since November. Market participants expect
an announcement of the next 10-year bond auction this week, which may prompt
a sell-off in the No 157 and signal a benchmark change.

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Emerging Investor: A sense of calm returns to Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER, PATRICK MCCURRY and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The skilful management of events by the Mexican government and confidence in
continuity of economic policy enabled Mexico's stock market to avoid the
crash that had been predicted after last Wednesday's assassination of Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the governing party. On
Friday, the first day of trading since the murder, the market index fell by
less than 1 per cent.
The emergence of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a former budget minister, as favourite
to take over from Mr Colosio, and the Dollars 6bn line of credit arranged
with the US treasury were particularly important in reviving investor
spirits after the initial panic. Mr Zedillo is from the inner circle of
President Salinas's advisers that have been managing economic and social
policy for the past five years.
Nevertheless, the assassination of Mr Colosio, who was heavily favoured to
win this August's election, comes at a moment of extreme political
uncertainty for Mexico, and may exacerbate an already tense political
situation. Over the past three months there has been, apart from the
assassination, a peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas, the head of the
country's largest bank was kidnapped, and Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy
in Chiapas appeared to be on the verge of declaring as an independent
candidate for the presidential elections.
Elsewhere in Latin America the immediate effect of the assassination was to
depress prices, while on the jittery US stock market the Dow Jones average
fell by 1 per cent.
Brazil's Sao Paulo stock exchange fell nearly 5 per cent on Thursday, but
then bounced back with a gain of 6 per cent on Friday. Local fund managers
and brokers are divided about whether the assassination will have a longer
term impact on the traditionally volatile Brazilian market.
The European investment community would adopt a wait-and-see attitude, with
most fund managers cautious but not too worried, according to a Latin
American analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London. In fact, last week's events
might have the beneficial effect, he said, of getting rid of, or at least
postponing, some of the more speculative new issues that had been planned
for the coming months in Mexico.
Forthcoming economic data in Mexico will be closely watched. The economy is
weak, having shown two successive quarters of negative growth in the second
half of last year. If the political uncertainty created by the assassination
shakes consumer confidence, it could threaten to choke the economic
recovery, and cut the earnings growth of quoted companies.
However, several factors are working in favour of the market.
Investors attributed some of the market's resilience to two decisions taken
by the government. In closing the foreign exchange, stock and money markets
on Thursday, the government prevented trading when the political situation
was at its most tense. By arranging the line of credit with the US treasury,
the finance ministry was able to make credible its commitment to defend the
peso within the pre-set band.
There was also a touch of good luck. The day after Mr Colosio was
assassinated, the government completed negotiations to join the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development. Membership of the OECD, while
largely symbolic, is seen by many investors as a sign of faith in Mexico by
the world's industrialised nations.
Some foreign investment houses have seen the crisis as an opportunity to buy
back into the market. Mexican equities have already fallen in dollar terms
by 10.2 per cent this year. Investment houses such as Goldman Sachs advised
clients to buy stocks that were being sold in panic, in the expectation that
when political uncertainty is resolved, stock prices will rise.
Prospects for political stability quickly returning are mixed. Mr Colosio's
assassination raised the spectre of turmoil as the ruling party chose its
new presidential candidate. Yet in the longer run, some analysts argue, the
killing might reduce political risk.
Their belief is that Mr Colosio's death will cause the country to unite
around the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and its new presidential
candidate. He, it is assumed, will carry on the economic policies of
President Salinas that have so favoured by foreign and domestic investors.
'The PRI is more likely to win now than before,' says Mr Jorge Mariscal,
head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs. 'The tragic event will
unify the party, force the opposition to tone down protests, and because
Mexicans will rally around the flag, help the government'.
Such a view has gained credence as Mr Zedillo emerged as the clear
front-runner to succeed Mr Colosio as the presidential candidate. The
killing also seems to have put an end to the political career of Mr Camacho,
who had been viewed by some investors as the main destabilising force this
year.
If the political uncertainty is resolved, then the key element driving the
market will be earnings growth of quoted companies, says Mr Timothy Heyman
of Baring Securities. Baring reckons that earnings will increase by 21 per
cent this year. Given that the price/earnings ratio of the Mexican market is
14.1 - compared to 16.2 in Argentina and 20.3 in Brazil - this would leave
room for strong gains this year.
Mr Robert J Pelosky of Morgan Stanley warns that earnings estimates may be
cut if the assassination shakes consumer confidence. And if the recovery
fails to materialise, this is sure to complicate efforts by the ruling party
to win a convincing and trouble-free election this year.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Nervous week for sterling and dollar -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dollar and sterling investors will this week be watching foreign exchanges
nervously following volatile trading at the end of last week.
Both currencies fell through key support levels, with the dollar reaching a
low of DM1.6595 in London on Friday and sterling touching DM2.4880.
The trading week will be truncated with most markets closed on Good Friday.
A key exception is in the US where the Bureau of Labour Statistics has
resisted high-level representations and is pressing ahead with the release
of key labour market data on the day.
March non-farm payrolls and hourly earnings figures will be closely watched
for evidence of inflation. There is some doubt, though, whether they can
have much effect on the dollar's fortunes.
Mr Gerald Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers, notes:
'The problem with the dollar is that all plausible increases in Fed funds
are already priced in'.
On Friday, the December eurodollar contract on Liffe settled at 94.78,
discounting three month rates of 5.22 per cent at the end of year. This
compares with dollar three month currently trading at 3.78/3.90 per cent.
In the UK, attention will focus on Wednesday's monthly monetary policy
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the
Bank of England governor.
Hopes of an interest rate cut, however, have receded following a worse than
expected February retail price inflation number; the weakness of sterling
and considerable pessimism about the interest rate outlook, reflected in the
short sterling futures market where prices fell sharply on Friday.
Most analysts believe the market has overreacted and that another 25 basis
points cut in the base rate, to 5.25 per cent, is possible.
The timing of a possible cut looks likely, however, to be delayed into the
summer. Any cut in the current climate runs the risk of undermining sterling
and the gilts market even further.
The outcome of the Italian elections, expected on Tuesday, is another
important event. The market appears to favour a strong, preferably
centre-left, government.
A strong showing from the fascists in the south, however, could unsettle
markets and push the lira below L1,000. The French franc is also in the
spot-light.
Concerns about whether monetary policy is not too tight, high unemployment
and rioting in the streets have led some observers to predict that the
French currency could slip as low as FFr3.48 to the D-Mark.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY
The market will react today to the outcome of yesterday's crucial municipal
elections, and expectations that the government will announce an austerity
package.
Last week the composite index fell 9 per cent in volatile trading. Turkey
was one of the best emerging market performers in 1993, but has since fallen
34.5 per cent.
Ms Nur Pekin of Schroders commented that expectations were that the
coalition would hold onto power in the elections.
The austerity package is likely to include a one year freeze on public
expenditure.
TOKYO
The Japan Securities Dealers Association has lifted restrictions for
Japanese individual investors to trade Shanghai B stocks.
Brokers do not expect an immediate rush to buy the shares by Japanese
investors, but hope that investment trust funds, which are now allowed to
accept funds from individuals following the lifting of restrictions by the
JSDA, will set up China funds.
'We want more investors to get accustomed to the Chinese market through
investment trust funds,' says Nomura Securities.
COLOMBO
The Colombo stock market has been one of this year's star performers.
According to Standard Chartered's latest research note, at the end of last
month the market was 'the number one (emerging market) performer in the
world'.
The All share index hit a peak of 1,443 on March 1, but since then
profit-taking has taken it down to 1,239.
Mr Rohan Fernando, deputy general manager of the stock exchange, last week
said that in less than 10 months the market had increased turnover 10 fold
to about SLRs250m (Dollars 5.2m), as foreign investors became active.
The exchange has plans to introduce electronic trading and has set a date of
the year end for its implementation.
There are also plans to start a second tier market, and the possibility of
an over-the-counter market dealing in India and Pakistan equities.
PERU
The privatisation programme will be completed by 1995, a government minister
said while on a visit to Japan last week.
Mr Daniel Hokama Tokashiki, the energy and mines minister, said that it was
hoped that the process would be finished by the end of President Fujimori's
term of office.
The government used to own about 220 companies, and 80 to 100 of them have
been or will be liquidated or absorbed by others.
Another 80 state-owned companies have been privatised and the rest will be
under private ownership by 1995.
The government, however, would remain a major shareholder in some concerns.
PRAGUE
The government has said that the Czech capital market is not yet ready for
an options exchange, in spite of attempts by a Swedish group to set up an
exchange similar to one operating in Slovakia.
'We understand the benefits a derivatives market can bring, but it is just
too early for this type of exchange with the liquidity we have in our
market,' said Mr Vladimir Rudlovacek, deputy finance minister.

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Markets: Breaking the bear's chains - Global Investor

<TEXT>
The first quarter results season begins in the US in a few weeks' time, and
Wall Street is expecting strong earnings gains. Could this be a trigger for
US stock markets to decouple from the bearish influence of the bond market
of the past two months?
Ever since the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy on February 4, and
sent the fixed income market diving, US equity markets have taken their
general direction in large measure from the jittery bond market. That said,
a remarkable feature of the turmoil in global markets since February 4 has
been the relative stability of US equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
has fallen little more than 4 per cent from its all-time high, reached at
the end of January, compared to a decline of about 6 per cent in Treasury
bond values since the Fed tightened; the Russell 2000 index of small
capitalisation stocks has outperformed the wider market, hitting several new
highs this month.
There is no small irony in this, since Fed tightening was widely expected to
blow a lot of froth off equity markets, while reassuring the fixed income
segment that the bank had inflation firmly under control. But the big equity
market corrections have been outside the US  - mainly in emerging markets -
as American investors' enthusiasm for foreign parts has cooled, and the
resulting repatriation of funds may have helped stabilise US equities.
The US equity markets even took in their stride last week's unsettling
combination of a second tightening by the Fed; the first rise in the prime
lending rate in four years; a flurry of fresh political posturing in the
Whitewater affair and the assassination of the front-runner to be the next
leader of Mexico. That said, Friday afternoon's drop in the long bond
through 7 per cent did sent the Dow down sharply.
Stocks may be, as some Wall Street analysts maintain, only halfway towards a
post-tightening correction of roughly 10 per cent, yet the market's
behaviour over the past few weeks suggests considerable resilience, and
potential for recovery, when stocks complete their current adjustment from a
world where their primary fuel is falling interest rates to one where
earnings are the driving force.
Wall Street is expecting solid double digit earnings increases both this
year and in 1995 as the economy expands rapidly and companies benefit in
productivity gains from the restructurings of the past few years.
Stocks would certainly benefit from a recovery of the bond market's nerve,
but the rally in Treasuries which followed last week's Fed tightening has
now been replaced by anxiety about the bank's next turn of the interest rate
screw, which could come on or about May 17, the date of the next
policy-making Open Markets Committee meeting. Certainly, its hard to see
Treasuries making much progress ahead of the employment figures for
February, due out on Good Friday, though thereafter a reassessment of
economic fundamentals could help it claw back some of its recent losses.
While history is no sure guide to the markets, the behaviour of stocks and
bonds following the 10 initial Fed tightening moves which have occured over
the past 30 years throws up some interesting statistics. An analysis by
Elizabeth Mackay at Bear Stearns shows that six months after the tightening
the S&amp;P 500 index was on average 1.2 per cent higher and a year later it was
6.1 per cent higher.
However, those averages hide some large disparities: for example, a year
after the March 1981 tightening the S&amp;P was down 16.8 per cent, while it was
up by a similar amount following the February 1988 action. And on three
occasions these rallies ended in bull market peaks: 1972, 1981 and 1987. In
other words, post tightening rallies can end nastily.
European bonds
Could the next few weeks finally bring about the much predicted decoupling
of European long bond prices from US Treasuries? European markets followed
the US into a sharp decline following the Fed's February 4 tightening, much
to the surprise of many analysts and hedge fund managers, and they have yet
to rally, even though the economic fundamentals on the two sides of the
Atlantic remain very different.
With main continental economies still in recession, the trend is still to
easier money, but the fixed income markets are still waiting for a strong
lead from the Bundesbank, which has been edging rates down at a snail's
pace. Last week the Bundesbank cut the key repurchase rate by 8 basis
points, taking its month-long reduction to 20 basis points, and Alison
Cottrell at Midland Global Markets reckons that is consistent with a 25
basis point cut in the discount rate and 50 basis points off the Lombard
rate at the bank's April 28 meeting, provided the cost of living inflation
figures for the month comes in at less than 3 per cent.
Hong Kong
Hong Kong has suffered one of the greatest drops of any leading equity
market since the Fed tightened. But with the Crown colony in the middle of a
reporting season producing strong results, has the correction run its
course?
The market, in common with others in south-east Asia, enjoyed a wonderful
run in 1993 as US investors focused more clearly on the region's rapid
growth; but a combination of growing political tension between the US and
China, and the Fed's tightening, has sent Hong Kong into sharp reverse.
Fed tightening matters partly because it has discouraged a flow of US funds
into emerging markets and partly because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to
the US currency, so US rate rises feed through into the local market. On
Friday, Hong Kong banks began tightening, with a 0.25 per cent rise in their
base rates.
The bull case for Hong Kong is that at current levels the market is good
value, compared to most other leading equity centres. Earnings are expected
to grow 15 per cent or higher this year, on the back of similar increases
for the past few years, and the market's prospective p/e ratio is about 15
to 16 for 1994, falling to 13 to 14 next year.
The market also remains the easiest way to place a bet on the extraordinary
spurt of growth transforming mainland China. Against that, however, are
several large negatives. The Hong Kong property market - a particularly
large component of the Hang Seng Index - is overvalued, and could be
vulnerable to a continued rise in long US rates, though for the moment Hong
Kong rates remain negative in real terms.
The political and economic climate in China is also casting a long shadow.
The market has learned to shrug off the dispute between the British Governor
and Beijing over democratic reforms in the colony, assuming that when China
takes control in 1997 it will not want to destabilise such an important
economic asset.
However, This year's round of annual brinkmanship between the US and China
over American demands for human rights concessions by Beijing, in exchange
for renewal of most favoured nation trading status, has been particularly
bruising. And while most analysts expect a comprise to be reached - the US
needs China's good offices in the nuclear weapons confrontation with North
Korea - there remains the possibility that one side or the other could make
a serious misjudgement.
David Roche, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, reckons that failure to sign a
deal could cut Hong Kong's GDP growth this year from the forecast 5 per cent
to 3 per cent.
Also weighing on the market are domestic Chinese issues. Deng Xiaoping,
China's leader since 1979 and the guiding hand behind its pragmatic economic
expansion, is 89 and on a recent appearance looked extremely frail. His
death could provoke a power struggle or weaken central government control.
At the same time, it is far from certain that the government can succeed
with its policy of slowing growth (from 13 per cent last year to 9 per cent
this year) and reining in inflation, without a hard landing which would also
hit Hong Kong's growth.
Over the long term, the Chinese market holds immense potential, but with the
current economic cycle looking long in the tooth, and international
investors wary, it is hard to see what is going to re-ignite the Hong Kong
market in the near term, though any decline through 7,500 would present a
good buying opportunity.

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Markets: In praise of the international monetary
non-system - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The floating exchange rate non-system comes of age this month. It was 21
years ago, in March 1973, that the attempt to sustain the postwar system of
fixed but adjustable exchange rates was abandoned. But that is not the only
anniversary. It was also 50 years ago, in July 1944, that the conference at
Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, designed the system that expired in 1973.
It is timely, therefore, to ask whether the global system of dirty floating
either will, or should, endure for the next 21 years, or more. The answer is
that it both will and should.
Floating exchange rates have had relatively few friends and many enemies.
Yet nothing successful has been put in their place. Small countries are able
to make credible commitments to fixed exchange rates, be it through currency
boards (in the case of Hong Kong, for example), the ERM (in the case of the
Netherlands) or just a unilateral target (in the case of Austria). Large
countries find it far more difficult. Even France, most devoted to the cause
of fixed exchange rates of the members of the group of seven leading
industrial countries, had to concede 15 per cent fluctuation bands within
the ERM last summer.
It looks as though the world must learn to stop worrying and love floating
exchange rates. Would that be so bad?
The chart shows what has happened to exchange rates of the three major
currencies - the dollar, the yen and the D-Mark - since 1971, the year when
President Nixon's administration devalued the dollar, a decision that led
ultimately to generalised floating. Five points emerge:
there is a considerably amount of short term 'noise' in the movement of
nominal exchange rates;
there was one huge swing in nominal exchange rates, which began in 1980 and
ending in 1987;
that swing went into reverse in early 1985, well before the celebrated
meeting of the G7 finance ministers at the Plaza Hotel in New York;
there has been a fairly close correlation between swings in nominal and real
exchange rates, although this has been less true for the D-Mark than for the
other two, because Germany is shielded by the ERM;
there have now been some seven years of reasonable exchange rate stability.
This last fact explains why schemes to reform the international monetary
system - common in the mid-1980s - have ceased to attract much attention
today. But it also helps put the earlier dollar 'bubble' in proper
perspective.
Neither credible exchange rate commitments nor intervention explain the long
period of relative stability, at least after 1987. This underlines the point
made by Professor Max Corden of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Advanced International Studies in Washington DC, in a book to be published
later this year that 'managed floating is not incompatible with considerable
exchange rate stability'.*
The conditions for this are low and stable inflation in all participants and
the absence of major shocks. Destabilising shocks do have to be major ones.
Even the fall of the Berlin Wall resulted in only a modest appreciation of
the D-Mark against the dollar, though it did lead to a meltdown in the more
rigid ERM.
In the mid-1980s, the non-system looked far more erratic. Now it is possible
to recognise that the ultimate cause of the rise of the dollar was an
exceptionally large shock in the world's biggest economy: the tightening of
monetary policy under Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
combined with the loosening of fiscal policy, under President Ronald Reagan.
It is also unlikely that any other exchange rate system could have coped
better with such a shock. Professor Corden's book, which shows just how
economic analysis ought to be used to clarify important questions for an
educated general public, indicates why.
Suppose that it is accepted that the dollar had begun to overshoot seriously
by 1983 and 1984, what would have been the consequences of using monetary
policy to stop the trend? The likely answer, as we know from British
experience with a similar bubble in 1987 and 1988, is that US inflation
would have risen instead. It is possible that the total real exchange rate
appreciation would then have been smaller. What is much more important is
that the loss of competitiveness would have been more difficult to reverse
under greater exchange rate stability. It would have required falling prices
or at the least rapidly falling inflation, rather than the depreciation of
the nominal exchange rate that occurred.
Not only has the present non-system been functioning quite well for some
years, it is also difficult to conceive of any workable alternatives. The
fate of the ERM has demonstrated the vulnerability of any fixed exchange
rate system with imperfect credibility and free capital movement. One
alternative would be a credibly fixed exchange rate system, such as a
currency board or, for large countries, a currency union. The only other
would be a float, but the more explicitly the exchange rate is managed
within the float, the greater its vulnerability to speculation.
As Professor Corden puts it, 'the current laissez faire international
monetary system is simply a market system, which co-ordinates the
decentralised decisions reached by private and public actors and is likely
to be as efficient at this as the market system within the domestic
economy.' In other words, floating exchange rates among major currencies
offer the worst possible system, except for all the others.

System (Oxford: Oxford University Press, forthcoming).

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ameritech to cut staff by 6,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ameritech, one of the US's seven regional telephone companies, announced
that it would take a Dollars 335m charge in the first quarter to cover a
planned cut of 6,000 from its non-management workforce by the end of 1994.
The charge, equivalent to 60 cents a share, echoes similar one-off charges
announced by other 'Baby Bells' in the past three months, among them Bell
South, which set aside Dollars 1.2bn, Nynex (Dollars 1.6bn) and Pacific
Telesis (Dollars 576m.)
The job cuts at Ameritech, from 48,000 non-management workers, reflect
pressure on local telephone companies from low growth and reductions in
revenues from providing local access to long-distance companies.
Ameritech's announcement on Friday came the day after accounting regulators
had failed to agree on tighter rules concerning restructuring charges.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that many companies are
including in restructuring charges costs which should be attributed to their
normal course of business.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Setbacks for Belgian retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of the recession on Belgian retailing was highlighted last week
after two of the country's largest retailers announced significant falls in
annual profits.
GIB, the international retailing group and Belgium's largest private-sector
employer, reported a net loss of BFr3.5bn (Dollars 102m) last year, against
a profit of BFr3.26bn in 1992.
Delhaize 'le Lion' group, which has a strong presence in the US, reported
1993 net consolidated profits of BFr1bn, down from BFr6.3bn in 1992.
Both groups insisted that the falls were partly due to restructuring and
redundancy programmes implemented in Belgium and the US. In particular, GIB
said the reorganisation of its Sarma unit had resulted in BFr5.5bn of
extraordinary costs.
Meanwhile, exceptional charges arising from the closure of 88 Food Lion
supermarkets in the US in 1994 reduced Delhaize's profits by BFr1.6bn.
Nevertheless, broadly flat sales and turnover also eroded profits.
Sales in GIB's European hypermarket and supermarket sector, which represent
61 per cent of total group sales, fell by 0.8 per cent last year. Although
this was partly offset by 9 per cent growth in the European DIY sector,
total group sales rose by only 2.2 per cent in 1993.
Delhaize's sales in Belgium rose by 2.5 per cent, to BFr93.4bn. In the US,
sales in the Food Lion group rose by 5.8 per cent to Dollars 7.6bn.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foster's nets ADollars 200m from
Beswick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewer which owns Courage in the UK, is to
net a ADollars 200m (USDollars 142m) profit from a complex restructuring of
its investment in Beswick, the joint venture company which holds 322m shares
in Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest industrial group.
However, the deal will also reinforce the Beswick arrangement, to BHP's
longer-term benefit. Nearly one-fifth of BHP's equity will continue to be
held through the joint venture, and Foster's will pledge to retain its 49.9
per cent voting interest in Beswick until the year 2010. BHP itself, which
has a 50 per cent voting stake in Beswick, also 'intends to retain all of
its interest'.
Beswick was born out of the various bid plays which surrounded BHP in the
late-1980s, and involved entrepreneurs like Mr John Elliott and the late Mr
Robert Holmes a Court.
Ahead of the restructuring, the BHP shares held by Beswick equalled about 19
per cent of the steel and natural resources group's equity. In turn, Beswick
was 50 per cent-owed by BHP (in terms of voting rights). Foster's held 49.9
per cent and the residual interest was owned by ANZ Executors and Trustee
Company.
Due to the appreciation in BHP shares since 1988, the value of the Beswick
holding has increased significantly. Foster's, which has sizeable
borrowings, has been keen to realise this value. BHP, however, was unwilling
to alter the Beswick ownership structure.
The restructuring accommodates these conflicting desires. Beswick has issued
new convertible redeemable preferences shares to all three ordinary
shareholders, on a one-for-10 basis. Virtually all the 'economic value' of
the Beswick stakes has transfered to the new preference shares, so that the
only real significance of the ordinary shares in the future is their
unchanged voting rights.
Beswick plans to sell about 15m BHP shares on the stockmarket, in order to
redeem the bulk of Foster's preference shares. This will result in a cash
payment to Foster's of around ADollars 245m, and a net profit to the brewing
group of about ADollars 200m.
Foster's will continue to hold a small number of Beswick preference shares,
plus the original ordinary shares. The value of that remaining holding will
be ADollars 73m, equal to Foster's initial investment in Beswick back in
1988.
Foster's will commit itself to retaining its ordinary shares in Beswick
until 2010 - compared with the previous agreed date of 1996 - but will be
able to sell more of its remaining preference shares at five-year intervals.
Beswick, meanwhile, will retain 307m BHP shares. BHP said that it intended
to retain all of its interest in Beswick, both ordinary and preference
shares.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italtel and Siemens unit form
telecoms partnership

<TEXT>
Italtel, the manufacturing subsidiary of Italy's state-owned
telecommunications group, has concluded its long search for a foreign
partner by announcing a tie-up with Siemens of Germany.
The accord, which is a further sign of cross-border moves in European
telecommunications, combines the operations of Italtel and the Italian
telecoms affiliate of Siemens in a new company expected to have a turnover
of about L3,400bn (Dollars 2bn) in 1994 and show strong medium-term growth.
Italtel's sales totalled L2,632bn in 1993.
Siemens and Italtel's holding company, the telecoms utility Stet, will each
control 50 per cent but, as the capital of Italtel is more than four times
the size of its new partner, the German group is to pay an adjustment fee.
Although the value of this has yet to be established, it is likely to be in
the range of L1,200bn to L1,700bn.
Stet is expected to buy back a 20 per cent stake in Italtel held by AT&amp;T.
The US group, Alcatel of France and Ericsson of Sweden were all considered
as potential partners for Italtel.
The agreement with Siemens is seen as essential to the growth of the
Milan-based Italtel, which has been restricted by a limited domestic market
and saw its net profits fall to L40.2bn in 1993 from L133.2bn.
The joint company aims to build up exports to 40 per cent of turnover by
1996 to 1997, and to concentrate on development of Italtel's core business -
production of its Linea UT digital telephone exchanges, which are in service
in 18 countries. Emphasis has also been placed on the research role of
Siemens in developing strategic products.
The decision on a new partner, which has been approved by Italian unions,
helps to secure jobs at Italtel, which has employs more than 15,000.
It comes amid wide restructuring within the country's telecoms industry The
government, through the IRI holding group, plans to sell its 52 per cent
stake in Stet by the end of this year.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Details of UAL deal with unions
due today

United Airlines will today release details of the wage and work rule
concessions that the company's employee unions accepted on Friday night when
they signed the final documents on a Dollars 5bn labour-led buy-out of the
airline.
UAL's management and machinists' and pilots' unions signed the deal - which
creates the largest employee-owned company in the US - after 10 days of
tense negotiations. The talks had been going on since March 15, when the
first deadline on concluding the buy-out passed without an agreement because
at the last minute the machinists' union had balked at some of the terms of
the deal.
At the time, machinists were said to have been unhappy that management and
non-contract employees were not accepting their fair share of concessions,
and that UAL planned after the buy-out to offer newly hired non-union
employees lower wages and benefits. Management and machinists, however,
ironed out their differences on Friday, allowing the buy-out to go ahead.
Under the broad terms of the deal, the two unions have agreed to Dollars 5bn
worth of wage and work rule concessions over the next six years in exchange
for 53 per cent of UAL's stock. The union representing the airline's 17,500
flight attendants was not involved in the buy-out negotiations because it
refused to accept the concessions offered by management.
UAL's shareholders, who will vote on whether to accept the buy-out this
summer, will receive Dollars 750m in cash in the deal, which will come from
the airline's current cash holdings of Dollars 1.8bn.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recession hits Publicis profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The downturn in the French advertising industry last year triggered a fall
in profits for Publicis, one of country's largest advertising agencies,
which reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits to FFr126.6m (Dollars
22m) from FFr145.6m in 1992.
Publicis, like other French agencies, has been affected by the recession,
which has prompted many companies to cut their marketing budgets, and by the
destabilising effect of la loi Sapin, the former socialist government's
reform of the media buying system.
The group saw consolidated sales fall by 9 per cent to FFr18.2bn in 1993
from FFr19.8bn in 1992. However, on a strictly comparable basis the decline
in sales was slightly smaller, at 4 per cent.
Publicis said that the resilience of its operations outside France had
helped to counter the pressures on its domestic business.
However, in spite of the downturn, the group last year expanded its French
advertising activities by taking control of FCA], which is one of the
largest agencies in France and has interests in the US and other European
countries.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italian bank raises dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group in
terms of assets, is to pay a L360 a share dividend for 1993, compared with
L300 for 1992, in spite of only a small improvement in net profits.
Operating profits rose by 29.9 per cent to L2,257bn (Dollars 1.37bn), with
falling interest rates reflecting favourably on bond dealings, but net
profits rose by only 1.4 per cent to L636bn.
Total assets, which were 6.3 per cent higher at L189,900bn, take into
account the merger towards the end of the year with Banca Provinciale
Lombarda and Banco Lariano. The bank said that careful cost control had
allowed it to absorb the costs of the merger.
However, the narrowing of interest rate differentials and debt restructuring
of troubled industrial groups limited net interest income to L3,978bn, a
rise of 1.9 per cent.
Difficult economic conditions restricted loans, and provisions for bad debts
totalled more than L700bn, of which L190bn is not fiscally deductible. A
further L226bn of unpaid interest is unlikely to be recovered.
The ratio of bad debts to the bank's overall loans has risen from 3.3 per
cent to 4.3 per cent but is below the average for the banking system.

FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: State Farm lifts estimate of
earthquake loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
January's California earthquake is likely to cost State Farm, the state's
biggest insurer, about Dollars 1bn, according to the latest estimate issued
by the company on Friday.
The estimate is sharply higher than the Dollars 600m State Farm had
initially predicted and ranks alongside the biggest one-off losses in the
industry. It follows upward revisions made by other US insurers in recent
days and takes the total insured cost of the disaster to around Dollars 4bn.
State Farm had said earlier in the week that it expected its original
estimate to be adequate. However, on Friday it said that detailed
examinations had revealed more severe structural damage than had been
anticipated.
The scale of the damage stemmed from the unusual nature of the earthquake,
which caused the ground to move in ways not normally experienced during
earthquakes in the area, it said.

FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CU takes 'embedded values' line - Composite
insurer follows the lead set by a number of its rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the largest of the UK's composite insurers, has reported
substantially increased profits and shareholders' funds for 1993 under
results recast using an alternative accounting approach to the statutory
requirements.
Under the 'embedded values' technique, its life profits rose to Pounds 280m
and total shareholders' funds to Pounds 3.5bn, compared with Pounds 119m and
Pounds 2.5bn respectively.
CU was following the lead taken by a number of other insurers over the last
few months which have begun to use techniques that they believe portray
their figures more effectively.
The Prudential Corporation and the life subsidiaries of BAT Industries both
used an alternative technique known as 'accruals accounting'. Others,
including Legal &amp; General, have adopted embedded value.
Insurance law requires results to be reported using an approach which
requires highly conservative reserving policies to ensure solvency.
Similar requirements will be made under new legislation triggered by EU
directives from the current year-end.
Both embedded value and accruals accounting recognise profits as they are
made, while providing discounts for future risks.
Mr Robbie Graham, CU's deputy group actuary, said the group decided that
embedded values reflected 'the way we seek to manage the business'.
He said the reason for delay in reporting using this technique - which has
been used internally for some time - was caused by the difficulties in
gathering information on such a wide range of life businesses.
The Association of British Insurers is currently considering ways in which
reporting using the alternative methods may be standardised.

FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels' listing under threat
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels, the troubled hotel group, has four days to conclude a
restructuring involving new management and a debt for equity swap, or a
takeover by an existing hotel group, if it is to keep its listing, writes
Simon Davies.
Resort's told shareholders in a letter this weekend that the Stock Exchange
had warned it would be delisted if restructuring proposals were not
submitted by March 31.
It was also revealed this weekend that the Serious Fraud Office was
investigating matters relating to past management of the hotels group.
The letter follows Resort's long-delayed results for the year to April 1993,
showing pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m.
Mr David Tonkinson, chairman, said Resort's bankers and stockholders were
supportive pending talks 'with other parties'.
The letter gives details on Resort's share suspension in July 1993, and the
resignation this month of Mr Robert Feld, former managing director.
Mr Tonkinson said in July it had become apparent that Resort had exceeded
its banking facilities, contrary to information provided by Mr Feld.
Mr Feld is accused of misleading the directors and banks, although he denies
these accusations.

FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Oasis has designs on spring float with
Pounds 60m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael and Maurice Bennett, the brothers who teamed up with designer Jeff
Banks in the 1970s to create the Warehouse high street chain, are planning
to bring their latest retail success to the market with the flotation this
spring of Oasis.
A medium priced women's wear retailer, Oasis is likely to have a market
value of more than Pounds 60m following the placing and public offer of
about half the share capital.
The two brothers and a third board member, Mr Vivian Scott, are expected to
retain most of their shares, currently totalling 60 per cent of the group.
Oasis intends to use the market to expand, although it will receive only
about Pounds 2m of the flotation proceeds. It currently runs 55 shops and
expects to double this number within the next three to four years.
The company is also aiming to prepare for possible acquisitions. Mr Michael
Bennett, chairman, is keen to expand the Oasis concept to other fashion
retailers, as well as tap into the lucrative brand licensing market around
the world.
Oasis is targeted at women between the ages of 18 and 35 who prefer natural
fibres and comfortable clothes.
The group was set up in the early 1980s by a husband and wife team to sell
ethnic clothing, but collapsed under crippling rents and a disastrous foray
into the property market.
In 1991, the receivers were called in. The Bennett brothers, who had taken a
stake in 1988 and begun to reposition the group, bought Oasis for Pounds
1.6m.
Since then, profits have jumped from Pounds 1.12m for the 47 weeks ended
January 25 1992 to Pounds 5.57m last year, with margins weakening only
slightly from 55.9 per cent to 55.7 per cent. Sales have risen in the same
period from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 29m. The group has no bank debt and cash
of Pounds 4.9m.
Sponsors to the float are Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. The broker is
Panmure Gordon.

FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Appleyard buys five Lex dealerships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Appleyard Group, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, is acquiring five
dealerships from Lex Service for Pounds 7.5m, their net asset value, writes
Rebecca Rea.
The amount will be satisfied by the issue of 4.75m shares, representing 7.2
per cent of the enlarged capital.
In the 12 months to December 26, they incurred combined operating losses of
Pounds 200,000 on turnover of Pounds 40.9m.
This is the second time in less than a week that Appleyard has bought barely
profitable dealerships.
On Tuesday it acquired five outlets from Whitworths Holdings for Pounds
10.2m.
Mr John Atkin, group business development director, said: 'We are seeking
businesses south of the M62 to become more national. We have been very
successful with our present dealerships and we hope to repeat the success
with these new acquisitions.'
Quicks Group, the car dealer, is selling its Birmingham Vauxhall dealership
to Barnard (Selly Oak) for Pounds 1.08m cash.
The book value of the assets was Pounds 1.13m at March 1. In the year to
December 31 the business reported a loss of Pounds 200,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Electricity, the UK utility, is set to buy a 20 per cent stake in
Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third largest energy producer and supplier which
is at present wholly owned by the city of Stockholm.
The two sides announced on Friday that they intended to reach full agreement
by the summer, following the signing of an agreement in principle that
Yorkshire will become a significant minority shareholder in Stockholm
Energi.
Stockholm Energi reported sales last year of SKr6bn (Pounds 510m), producing
6,123 gigawatt hours of electricity, 5,093 gigawatt hours of hot water-based
district heating and 369 gigawatt hours of town gas. Half its output is
generated by nuclear power and 35 per cent by hydro-electric power.
The company, based chiefly in the Swedish capital, returned a profit of
SKr217m in 1993, but is projecting profits of about SKr1bn this year after
unwinding heavy losses from debts held in foreign currency.
Stockholm city authorities decided to seek a foreign partner in anticipation
of deregulation of the Swedish market. Although deregulation terms have yet
to be determined by the government, Stockholm Energi said it needed new
capital to meet new competition in its established market and to enable it
to seek new markets for itself.

Mr Keith Bailey, chairman and chief executive of BSA Tools, a rival bidder
for FMT, claims a chance has been missed to save the last remaining UK-owned
producer of horizontal machining centres and manufacturing systems, and is
unhappy with the way his bid was treated by Ernst &amp; Young, the receivers.
Meanwhile, Mr Joe Wickham, FMT's former manufacturing director and a
shareholder in the company, said the receivers have let the workforce down
by failing to ensure that the business was sold as a going concern, as
originally intended. But Mr Alan Bloom, the receiver, has strongly defended
the sale to G&amp;L, and said Mr Bailey's bid was treated fairly.
G&amp;L is understood to have paid about Pounds 650,000 for the FMT name and
that of Kearns-Richards, along with the intellectual rights, and the
profitable service, spare parts and machine rebuild business.
Mr Bailey says he would have retained a nucleus of key FMT employees and
transferred final assembly of FMT machines to BSA Tools' plant, which has
spare capacity.
Mr Bailey was attracted by FMT's business opportunities in China - it was
close to clinching an important joint venture there. 'It's a great loss, and
I don't believe the best decision was reached,' he said.
He is upset that G&amp;L's bid was accepted only hours before he was due to
deliver a banker's draft to clinch the purchase.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): When swings and roundabouts limit
analysis - Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashion for updating analysts on trading may have taken something of a
dent after Inchcape's experience in January. When the international trading
group, which announces 1993 results today, met stockbroking analysts, some
thought it had said nothing new of any great significance.
But others came away from the meeting bearish, and cut their forecasts. In
the following days the shares slumped nearly 70p from a high of 606p, and
have only recently begun to recover.
All will be revealed in today's numbers. There is a wide range of forecasts,
although most close Inchcape watchers range from Pounds 255m to Pounds 270m,
up from Pounds 250.1m in 1992, excluding a Pounds 16m profit on the sale of
a minority stake in Toyota GB to Toyota.
Inchcape told analysts at the briefing that the second half had been similar
to the first, when profits rose from Pounds 117.1m to Pounds 130.9m, in
spite of a Pounds 12m higher interest charge.
With such a diverse group there have been inevitable swings and roundabouts.
One problem has been the strength of the yen last year which hit sales of
Japanese cars to Europe. Another has been weak consumer demand in Japan and
austerity measures in China, which held back sales of the branded goods
Inchcape markets. But on the plus side, the UK car market picked up in 1993
with Toyota increasing its market share. The business services division was
also performing well in most areas.
Analysts may also take the opportunity to ask about Inchcape's intentions
towards Gestetner, the office equipment distributor, where it has a 15 per
cent stake with the option to go to 25 per cent. Many assume Inchcape will
bid this year.
Inchcape is expected to give a more detailed division of profits within its
motors sector, which contributed 60 per cent of total profits in 1992.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Caradon acquisition in the
spotlight - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caradon, the building products group which last year bought RTZ's Pillar
business for Pounds 800m, is expected to show a slight rise in pre-tax
profits for 1993 from Pounds 125.7m to around Pounds 128m to Pounds 130m
when it reports on Wednesday.
However, there will also be an exceptional profit of Pounds 100m on the sale
last year of the group's 25 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging
group. Pillar will only have contributed for two months, but shareholders
will look for clues as to how it is performing.
Pearson: City analysts expect the media group's pre-tax profits to have
increased from Pounds 151m in 1992 to between Pounds 201m and Pounds 215m
for 1993 when results for the year to December are announced today. The
results may take some of the pressure off the share price which has dropped
from a high this year of 735p to 615p, with a particularly sharp drop in the
past week. The fall does not seem to have been triggered by any event and
trading volumes in the shares have been low. Redland: Europe's biggest roof
tile producer, reports on Thursday and is expected to have increased pre-tax
profits from Pounds 221.5m to Pounds 270m last year on a strong performance
in Germany.
Ciba: The biggest of the 'big three' Swiss pharmaceuticals companies,
reveals 1993 results tomorrow that should shed light on demand trends in
continental European markets. Results from the industry division - Ciba's
other two main divisions are agricultural and healthcare - will be the first
under the magnifying glass as investors hunt for evidence of an end to price
weakness.
Taylor Woodrow: As the results season for construction and building
materials companies continues, as much attention will be focused on current
trading conditions as on the actual figures. Tomorrow it is the turn of
Taylor Woodrow and analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 20m and
Pounds 25m, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 94.5m for 1992, which
included Pounds 51.5m of property provisions.
Blenheim: The exhibition organiser whose shares have almost halved over the
past year, is expected tomorrow to report profits of between Pounds 42m and
Pounds 45m for 1993. That compares with profits of Pounds 49.7m for the 16
months to December 1992. Blenheim Group's two big biennial exhibitions fell
into last year and analysts are forecasting lower profits of between Pounds
40m and Pounds 43m in 1994.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Glaxo drug rival wins licence for UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLWEN GLYNN OWEN and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fortunes of the world's best selling drug, Zantac, the anti-ulcer
treatment made by Glaxo of the UK, will come under renewed threat tomorrow
with confirmation that a new treatment involving Losec, its chief competitor
made by Astra of Sweden, has been licensed in the UK.
The new treatment includes an antibiotic to kill bacteria which can cause a
relapse of the ulcer. Up to one quarter of Zantac's global annual sales of
Pounds 3.5bn is accounted for by patients who take it over the long term to
prevent such a relapse, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers.
The Losec-plus-antibiotic combination promises to cut sharply the need for
this maintenance therapy. It gives Astra a significant head start over
Glaxo, which is filing an anti-bacterial version of Zantac for regulatory
approval later this year.
The licence is the latest blow to Zantac. Last week, a subsidiary of Ciba,
the Swiss drugs company, said it would launch an unbranded version of Zantac
that appears to sidestep the company's patent protection.
Separately, SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, is preparing to
launch non-prescription versions of Tagamet, which was Zantac's main rival
for most of the 1980s before the launch of Losec.
Further bad news could be on its way with the launch next month of a drug by
Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda that works on the same principles as
Losec. Losec and Takeda's lansoprazole are 'proton pump inhibitors'. They
can give faster healing and relief from symptoms than older treatments such
as Zantac and Tagamet.
The bacteria the Losec-plus-antibiotic treatment is designed to combat,
Helicobacter Pylori, are increasingly seen as central to a number of gastric
disorders including ulcers.
Without eradication therapy, ulcer patients require years of regular
treatment with Zantac or other stomach acid suppressing drugs to prevent
ulcer recurrence and life threatening complications.
The UK licence for H. Pylori eradication therapy gives Astra the go-ahead to
promote this ulcer management approach to general practitioners. Research
suggests it improves patients' quality of life while saving several
thousands of pounds on a practice's drug budget. GPs, under pressure to cut
drug spending, are likely to find the prospect attractive.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Silver price set to top Dollars 6 this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silver's price this week is virtually certain to go above Dollars 6 a troy
ounce for the first time since March 1989, driven up by the large
speculative commodity funds which are targeting the market.
The funds already have helped push up the price from this year's low of
Dollars 4.90 in January to Dollars 5.70 in London on Friday. Their first
target, according to dealers, is Dollars 6 an ounce.
The same funds, including the Quantum Fund operated by Mr George Soros, the
high-profile financier and currency speculator, successfully tackled the
gold market about this time last year and manoeuvred the price up from a
seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce to more than Dollars 400.
They are rumoured to have recently spent Dollars 1bn to buy physical silver
which they have moved from the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) to vaults
in Delaware to give the impression that Comex stocks are falling because of
heavy demand. Dealers suggest the funds are willing to spend another Dollars
1bn in this effort.
Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at the Lehman Brothers financial services
group in New York, said that, whereas the funds' attack on the gold price
came when there was record demand for physical metal, this was not the case
with silver.
'I talk to consumers every day and they are not buying more silver. There
has been no genuine pick-up in industrial demand,' he said.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Good omens from Bavarian
institutions - Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany, will announce its 1993 figures
on Thursday. In addition to a commentary on last year's numbers, Mr Hilmar
Kopper, chief executive and one of the most important businessmen in
Germany, will give his views on current year trading, on the economy and
other issues of the day.
Deutsche will not be the first big German bank to report - Bayerische
Vereinsbank and the Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank, the two large
Bavarian institutions, both reported last week. It will, however, be the
first of the 'big three', with Dresdner and Commerzbank holding their press
conferences next week and the week after.
At the Bavarian banks, operating profits after provisions for bad and
doubtful debts rose by about a third in each case. They enjoyed the happy
combination of buoyant securities markets and strong loan growth which meant
that profits climbed rapidly despite the deep recession.
This constellation of favourable circumstances will not have passed Deutsche
Bank by, although its sheer size means that the growth will not be as
pronounced as at smaller institutions.
Analysts will study Mr Kopper's remarks on current year trading with
interest.

FT  28 MAR 94 / IBM drags itself out of the mire / Assessing Lou Gerstner's
first year at the helm of computer company
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve months after his appointment as chairman and chief executive of
International Business Machines, Mr Lou Gerstner is 'increasingly confident'
that the ailing computer company's problems can eventually be overcome.
The tough-talking New Yorker is not, however, holding out hopes of a return
to the glory days of the 'old IBM', when the company dominated the
information technology industry and reaped huge profits on its flagship
mainframe computers.
He bluntly points to IBM's ingrained bureaucratic culture as the root cause
of the company's heavy losses over the past three years. IBM is 'too
pre-occupied with our own view of the world', he says, telling employees
that they must change the way they work if they are to have a future with
the company.
Without much fanfare, Mr Gerstner has, in his first year at IBM,
restructured the higher management, appointed 'outsiders' to top positions
and, through attrition, reshaped the board of directors.
Few of these actions have caught public attention, largely because Mr
Gerstner prefers it that way. A newcomer to the computer industry, he is
disconcerted by the interest that IBM attracts. 'I don't give a lot of
speeches,' he says. 'My choice in everything is to say nothing and go do
it.'
Before a meeting with financial analysts in New York last week when he
outlined his strategic plans for the company, Mr Gerstner discussed his
first year at IBM.
The company has been through 'an economic shock the equivalent of a Los
Angeles earthquake', he said. Its gross profit margins fell from more than
55 per cent in 1990 to 38 per cent last year. 'When you multiply that drop
by revenues of over Dollars 62bn (Pounds 42m), you understand what has
happened to this company.'
IBM 'no longer makes a lot of money on mainframe computers', he said. 'High
mainframe (profit) margins are gone' - a thing of the past. 'No IBM margins
are ever going to return to the levels we used to have, at least we are not
planning on it.'
Neither does he expect to replace mainframe profits with a new high margin
product. 'We do not have as part of our game plan to create a dominant
position that is built on very, very high prices relative to costs,' said Mr
Gerstner.
'We are forcing ourselves to adopt a pessimistic view,' he said, declining
to predict IBM's long-term financial outlook. 'We are draining a swamp here.
We are not focused on the picnic grounds across the meadow.'
Cutting costs was Mr Gerstner's first priority when he joined IBM and he won
praise from financial analysts for moving decisively, last July, with a
Dollars 8.9bn restructuring charge including the cost of 35,000 job cuts, to
be completed by the end of 1995.
Based on current business conditions, IBM does not anticipate further
lay-offs. However, Mr Gerstner sees a 'goldmine' of other opportunities to
cut IBM's costs through centralising purchasing, tighter inventory
management, and eliminating duplication of effort in product development. He
has formed several re-engineering task forces with the goal of reducing
costs by Dollars 3bn this year and a further Dollars 1bn in 1995.
The second item on Mr Gerstner's 'must do' list for his first year at IBM
was to 'get closer to customers'. In this area he also wins high marks.
'I've seen a dramatic change in the way IBM sells technology. Its a big, big
difference,' says Mr Bo Hedfors, senior vice-president of systems and
technology at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications and electronics
group.
Moves to lower prices for hardware and software have helped customer
relations, Mr Gerstner acknowledges, but he takes credit for meeting with
'literally thousands and thousands of customers' over the past 12 months.
These contacts prompted him to accelerate the retraining of IBM's sales
team. Traditionally IBM's 'blue suits' have been generalists, selling
everything from mainframe computers to printer ribbons. To compete more
effectively with the likes of Sun Microsystems in the workstation market, or
Compaq Computer in personal computers, IBM is now forming product specialist
sales groups and consulting teams.
However, two other important goals set by Mr Gerstner when he joined IBM are
proving more difficult to achieve: setting strategic directions and
restoring employee morale.
The new IBM chairman has been widely criticised over recent months for
failing to deliver a new 'vision' for IBM. He brought much of this criticism
on himself by declaring in July that 'the last thing IBM needs right now is
a vision'.
'That was like telling the passengers on a rudderless ship, to keep
shovelling coal into the engine and not worry about the direction they are
sailing in,' says Mr Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a market
research group.
At the meeting with analysts, Mr Gerstner revealed only what he called the
'broad brush-strokes' of IBM's strategy. The company plans to unveil more
details about its various product segments over the coming months, a senior
IBM executive said. Still, many analysts were disappointed.
The most important 'strategic imperative', Mr Gerstner said, was to exploit
IBM's technology better than in the past. Although the company has invented
many of the basic technologies used in the computer industry, it has often
seen competitors take advantage of them faster. To speed technology to
market, IBM will 'make bets earlier' on which technologies to develop,
eliminating costly duplication and the 'great debates within IBM over
alternative solutions' that have slowed product introductions in the past,
he said. But this could increase IBM's risks of backing the wrong horse and
eliminate some of the competitive advantages that the company has previously
gained from its bigger size and resources.
IBM is also expanding its efforts to license technology to other companies,
rather than seeing it cloned. Royalty income from licensing agreements has
doubled in the past two years to almost Dollars 500m. All of these profits
can be ploughed back into research, Mr Gerstner says. He has also
accelerated a 'massive redeployment of development money' away from
mainframe computers towards development of technology and software for
client/server computers and networks.
IBM's failure to make this shift earlier 'is the single most important
mistake IBM has made in the past decade', acknowledged Mr Gerstner. The
company is overhauling its entire product line to meet growing demands for
networked computers that stick to industry standards.
Mr Gerstner must also demolish the rule-bound culture that many say prevents
IBM from adapting more quickly to changes in the computer market. Over the
past 12 months, Mr Gerstner has spent 'hundreds and hundreds of hours
meeting with tens of thousands of employees all over the world'. A disciple
of Mr Jack Welch, the chairman of General Electric, who invigorated that
company's stodgy culture, Mr Gerstner has been sending shock waves through
IBM with frank addresses to employees. 'We don't move fast enough in this
company,' he chided on a visit to one US site. 'This is an industry in which
success goes to the swift, more than to the smart.
'We've got to become more nimble, entrepreneurial, focused, customer driven.
We must become a principle-based company, rather than a procedural-based
company.'
However, cultural changes must start at the top, says Mr John Jones, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US broking house. He praises Mr Gerstner's
appointments of 'outsiders' to top positions, in particular the choice of Mr
Jerry York, formerly of Chrysler, as chief financial officer. 'York is the
kind of executive that IBM needs; somebody who will ask the tough questions
and not accept the historic explanations for lack of performance.' But
analysts say that Mr Gerstner needs to recruit more fresh blood.
Most of Mr Gerstner's inner circle are long-time IBM executives. However,
their roles within the company have been changed. Mr Jim Cannavino, long
known as a maverick within the company, has been put in charge of strategy
and development. Ms Ellen Hancock, who heads IBM's networking division, is
also now spearheading software strategy for the whole company.
IBM's executive management committee, long the centre of power within the
company, has been eliminated. In its place is the new corporate executive
committee, comprising Mr Gerstner and 10 other executives, which meets
several times a month to discuss strategy.
In addition, a worldwide management council, with about 35 members including
the heads of each product division and managers of regional operations,
covers operational as well as strategic issues.
The IBM board of directors, loudly criticised at last year's shareholder
meeting for blindly approving decisions that led the company astray, has
been slimmed down over the past year.
Since Mr Gerstner's appointment, 10 of the 19 board members who appointed
him have retired, or will do so next month. Yet only one new board member
has been added: Mr Charles Knight, chairman of Emerson Electric. 'Moulding a
new board of directors is just as important as making internal changes if
Gerstner's vision of tomorrow is to become reality,' says Mr Djurdjevic. IBM
needs to add directors representing constituencies such as its customers
outside the US, he says. 'The job is only half done.'
Most analysts award Mr Gerstner a 'gentleman's B' for his first year's
performance at IBM. He has started well, they say, but failed to complete
all his assignments. His lack of knowledge of the computer industry and
technology is still evident, but he has clearly grasped IBM's problems. The
critical test will be IBM's financial performance over the next few
quarters.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Banesto investors approve rescue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The contest for control of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled
Spanish bank, this week opens in earnest following approval by shareholders
of a Bank of Spain-sponsored rescue plan.
At a general meeting on Saturday, minority shareholders protested angrily
against the Bank of Spain's intervention and the writing-down of their
shares, but failed to muster enough support to mount a legal challenge
against the plan.
With some 73 per cent of votes delegated in advance to the provisional
Banesto board, the meeting produced overwhelming support for the rescue
package. Under the plan, Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund will contribute
Pta285bn (Pounds 1.4bn), lend Pta315bn for four years interest-free and
subscribe to Pta180bn of new capital which it will then sell to a bank or
group of banks.
The meeting also voted for joint legal action against the previous Banesto
board, dismissed by the Bank of Spain three months ago. Mr Alfredo Saenz,
the current chairman, has a month to present the action, which will seek
damages for acts undertaken in breach of the law or the statutes, or without
proper diligence.
JP Morgan, the US bank which was represented on the former board by Mr
Robert Mendoza, one of its vice-presidents, delegated its vote to back the
rescue plan but opposed the legal action.
Mr Mario Conde, the ousted chairman, stayed away from the meeting, which
heard 15 separate proposals for legal proceedings against the former
administrators.
The way is now cleared for bidding to buy the controlling interest from the
Deposit Guarantee Fund. Three banks - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander
and Argentaria - are in the running for a deal which would give any of them
a dominant position in the Spanish banking sector.
A price of Pta100m has been set for the documentation in order to restrict
it to serious bidders. The winning bank must keep at least 30 per cent for
four years.

FT  28 MAR 94 / New uncertainty as Italy goes to polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's 48m voters began two days of polling yesterday in the country's most
unpredictable general election since democracy was restored after the second
world war.
The election marks the formal end of the postwar dominance by the Christian
Democrats and their allies, and more than 80 per cent of the candidates have
no parliamentary experience.
The last election was only two years ago, but the corruption scandals which
caused the collapse of the ruling parties forced a fresh poll.
The first exit polls will be announced tonight at 10pm, when polling
stations close. But the interior ministry has warned that it could be well
into tomorrow before there is a clear indication of the outcome.
Vote-counting has been complicated by new electoral laws. These introduced a
first-past-the-post system for 75 per cent of the seats in both houses of
parliament, but retained proportional representation in revised form for the
rest.
Voters were yesterday being asked to choose between 15 main parties that had
formed into three broad alliances of the left, centre and right.
The main protagonists are the seven-party Progressive Alliance on the left
and the three-party Freedom Alliance on the right, dominated by the media
magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Before the ban on opinion polls during the final two weeks of the campaign,
the Freedom Alliance looked set to obtain the most seats, but not an
absolute majority. The alliance contains Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia
movement, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the
neo-Fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini.
In the final stages of the campaign, the Progressives, led by the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) under Mr Achille Occhetto,
arch-rival of Mr Berlusconi, claimed they had made gains with their superior
grassroots organisation.
The centrist Italian Pact appeared to claw back some ground by calling on
voters to give the centre parties a balancing role.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Shanghai's Bund seeks pre-revolution glories: Bidding soon
for buildings in former financial hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SHANGHAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shanghai will soon auction the stately buildings lining its waterfront,
where international and Chinese financial institutions will be bidding for a
piece of the city's glorious past.
Dubbed the 'sale of the century' by business people, the Shanghai government
expects to raise millions of dollars from selling long-term leases for
buildings on the Bund, the centre of Chinese finance before the revolution
in 1949.
Mr Xu Kuangdi, Shanghai's vice-mayor, said tenders would be invited in May
for 37 buildings, including the former headquarters of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, now used by the municipal government.
Shanghai hopes the Bund will again become the country's 'Finance Street',
and Mr Xu said the auction was part of the government's commitment to
'playing a role in the international market'.
He said that by early next month, a special authority charged with disposing
of buildings on the Bund would begin releasing details of sites for sale,
including floor space and the leases. Officials have been talking of 50-year
leaseholds.
Representatives of international financial institutions have been waiting
for Shanghai to say how it would dispose of the Bund properties, their
facades little changed since the 1949 Communist takeover.
Mr Xu said there was no way of predicting the value of Bund real estate, but
judging by soaring rents in less desirable locations, prices should be high
and could be astronomical.
At the last count, 28 foreign banks had opened branches in Shanghai, with
another dozen expected by the end of this year.
HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citibank are among foreign banks apparently
interested in a Bund location, but bank officials are saying little.
A HSBC official said that while the bank's old headquarters were 'very
prestigious', the building was 'not exactly suitable for the 20th century'.
Proceeds from the sale of leases will be used to relocate government
institutions from the Bund, and to refurbish Shanghai's crumbling
infrastructure. A municipal headquarters is already being built near
People's Park, the Shanghai racecourse of pre-revolution days.
Mr Xu would like to see the return of the Bank of China, now the foreign
currency bank, which was established in 1905 in Shanghai as the Bank of
Great Qing, the imperial bank of the Qing Dynasty. But he assured
prospective foreign purchasers that Chinese banks would not receive special
treatment in the tender process.
'The successful purchasers will be the ones who can pay the highest price,'
Mr Xu said.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Auditors to BCCI face Dollars 11bn claims for damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The auditors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International face
claims from the liquidators of up to Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.5bn), according
to legal documents updating the original action.
Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young,
are alleged to have failed to detect or report financial irregularities at
the bank stretching back as far as 1977 and 1979 respectively.
The details appear in the statement of claim lodged in the high court which
accompanies writs issued by BCCI's liquidators at Touche Ross against the
auditors in the course of the last two years. The statement has not been
made public. It was previously estimated the claims would be worth about
Dollars 8bn.
The damages claimed further increase one of the largest ever legal actions.
The claims pursue the two firms for damages relating to the overall deficit
of the bank discovered when it collapsed, overpaid tax, dividends and
charitable grants, and nearly Dollars 4.8m in audit and consultancy fees
which the two companies earned between 1985 and 1987.
The statement of claim says that the financial position of BCCI was
materially misstated in 1985, 1986 and 1987. It does not quantify any
differences before this time because claims will not be allowed back beyond
1985.
Had the problems been brought to light, the statement claims that 'imprudent
conduct' at BCCI would have ended, weaknesses been corrected, management
restructured and new capital would not have been needed.
It says that for the year ending in December 1985, BCC (Overseas) reported a
total capital fund of Dollars 425m and a profit of Dollars 32.2m. The
figures estimated by the liquidators were a deficit of Dollars 2.4bn and a
loss of Dollars 1.5bn respectively.
By 1987, capital funds were, according to the statement, in deficit by
nearly Dollars 5bn compared with reported assets of Dollars 532m, and there
were losses for the year of Dollars 959m in contrast to the reported profit
of Dollars 11.1m.
Discrepancies between the reported figures and the liquidators' recalculated
figures are analysed for BCCI SA, BCCI Holdings and the BCCI Group overall.
The statement of claim alleges that Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney had
expressed concerns about deficiencies or weaknesses in parts of the bank for
up to 14 years before BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991. It says
the firms were in breach of their duties to the shareholders of BCCI
companies for failure to take account of the warning signs or to report
weaknesses.
Price Waterhouse said last night: 'We are convinced we will be vindicated.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Environment's review of commercial leases, coming to all
good HMSO bookshops soon, could rattle the foundations of the UK property
market. Like many British institutions, the standard 25-year lease, with its
seemingly iniquitous upward-only rent reviews, has come under fire. The
charge is that such leases are too rigid, unfairly weighted against the
tenant and institutionalise inflation. Yet if they were changed, new
property development would become riskier, given the unpredictability of
future income. Rental and capital values would move together more closely
and quickly transform property from a quasi-bond into a quasi-equity
investment. Landlords would offset the increased risk by demanding higher
initial rents or would simply stop developing marginal properties. The DoE's
urban regeneration champions would hardly appreciate their colleagues'
radicalism.
The DoE would therefore be wise to conclude that the traditional lease is
the worst form of commercial rental agreement apart from all the rest.
Besides, it could argue that the market's invisible hand is already slowly
shaping leases to new economic conditions. Leases are shortening to 10 or 15
years and often include break clauses. The abolition of confidentiality
clauses would help encourage a less imperfect market. After all, markets
work best where the information flow is free.
If the government still worries that upward-only rent reviews stoke
inflation, it could always recommend linking rents to the retail prices
index, as happens in other European countries. That would provide another
incentive for its own anti-inflationary policies.

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Food retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The big food retailers scared themselves and their shareholders witless last
year by competing over-aggressively on price. But they appear to have
re-established a more orderly grocery market in recent months. Big price
promotions have stopped since J. Sainsbury stamped its foot and launched its
essential-for-essentials campaign. Yet the critical question remains whether
that price skirmishing represented a one-off adjustment to the discount
threat or was just the first manifestation of a downward price spiral caused
by over-capacity.
Wm Morrison recently soothed the market by suggesting the former. Food
retailers are also trying to stabilise the situation by scaling back new
store developments. Stricter planning restrictions are reinforcing the
effect. There is still some scope to grow profits by nailing suppliers to
the floor and cutting in-house costs. The grocers are also broadening their
product ranges and hastening diversification plans. Sainsbury's already
boasts a presence in the US through Shaw's and runs Savacentre and Homebase
in the UK too. Tesco has dipped its toe in France and a toe nail in Hungary.
Even so, the sector's earnings outlook will remain dull for a few years yet.
A big re-rating therefore seems unlikely. However, there is undoubtedly
great value to be had over the longer term as the cash stream remains strong
and development costs tumble. An outside bidder with a lot of patience may
yet be tempted to unlock it. If the grocery chains were any smaller, their
own managers may have been tempted to have a go.

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Tarnished Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilts market really is a sorry sight. According to Salomon Brothers it
has been the worst performer of all leading bond markets so far this year
with a negative return in local currency terms of 7.18 per cent. Last week
the Bank of England again intervened to ensure orderly markets. With long
yields nudging 8 per cent it has switched to a floating rate issue for this
week's auction. Clearly the UK has been caught up in worldwide bond anxiety
since the Federal reserve started raising interest rates last month. But
that does not explain why it has suffered more than any other.
Part of the answer is that last year's supply problem has finally come home
to roost. Heavy borrowing then was easily absorbed by speculative hedge
funds and other professional dealers attracted by a particularly favourable
combination of an upward sloping yield curve with falling inflation and
interest rates. But it is now clear that much of this paper did not find its
way into firm hands. Institutions bought only Pounds 13bn worth against
issuance of about Pounds 50bn. Yields have to rise to the point where paper
now being off-loaded by its original buyers becomes attractive to long-term
investors. The institutions have no particular incentive to jump in when
they think they can buy the same bonds cheaper tomorrow.
Looked at from this perspective, the gilts market is clearly overshooting.
Though investors have become less optimistic about inflation, the
deterioration does not appear sharp enough to warrant the 20 point fall in
the long end of the market since its peak in late January. Once cooler heads
prevail and investors do decide that the absolute level of yields is
attractive, the rebound could be quite strong, especially since the prospect
of further floating rate issues will mitigate supply worries for 1994-95.
But that leaves the question of what actually represents value in the gilts
market. Against expectations that inflation could fall to around 2 per cent
during the summer, a yield of nearly 8 per cent looks attractive. Price
rises would be unlikely to stick at these levels, though. Assuming inflation
rises to the top of the government's 4 per cent target in the medium term,
yields between 7 and 7.5 per cent would not look out of place.
The biggest problem is that expectations of where inflation - and interest
rates - will finally settle are shifting. Recent US experience is a reminder
of what can happen when the stance of monetary policy changes and the UK is
considerably further along the cycle than the rest of Europe. In December,
the sterling money market was discounting base rates just below 5 per cent
by the end of 1994 and 5.6 per cent by the end of 1995. On Friday it was
projecting rates of 5.7 and 7.7 per cent respectively.
The money market, of course, is often wrong in its predictions. But its
recent behaviour is a reminder that, while there may have been a structural
downward shift in inflation, the cycle has not been done away with
altogether. The gilts market has to contend with the realisation that
inflation and interest rates are now at or near their trough. Even if it now
rallies, that implies a basic shift in mood.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Workers' rights and free trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For an institution which will not come into being before next year, the
planned World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, is already accumulating an impressive workload. On top of
the responsibilities vested in it by the Uruguay Round agreement, the WTO is
due to be charged with reporting on trade and environment policy. Now
efforts are being made - for highly suspect reasons - to add the still more
controversial question of workers' rights and labour standards.
The US has already moved to have the matter placed on the WTO agenda. Sir
Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, says he favours a similar
proposal. Though openly dubious about the merits of the case, he appears to
have been swayed by growing political support for it in France and Italy, as
well as in the US. He evidently fears that, if the EU ducks the issue, it
could lose influence over events and put its own cohesion at risk.
Sir Leon is right to be sceptical. Workers' rights is a large and complex
subject, and the arguments for linking it with trade policy are
unpersuasive. But the motives of the most vocal petitioners for action are
all too clear. Their overriding concern is to protect domestic industries by
penalising low-cost foreign exporters. France, which for once views the US
as a tactical ally, has given the game away by stigmatising it as 'social
dumping'.
Labour surplus
The protectionist lobby is deluding itself. Even if it succeeded in imposing
minimum labour standards on low-cost exporters, that would do little to
blunt their comparative advantage or to relieve unemployment in the west.
Wages in less developed countries will stay low as long as they remain poor
and have a huge labour surplus. Nor would labour standards deter
multinational companies from shifting investments to regions such as Asia
and Latin America, since wages are typically a fraction of their overall
production costs.
Furthermore, the most thrusting newer exporters are relatively high-wage
economies such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The biggest threats to
western prosperity and competitiveness are manufactured at home.
The belief that trade policy can secure humanitarian goals, such as
preventing forced labour, raising safety standards and entrenching the right
of free association, is equally shaky. It relies heavily on the argument
that trade policy offers the best prospect of exerting leverage on
repressive third-world regimes, not on realistic assessment of its likely
efficacy.
Increased deprivation
Repugnant as child labour or wilfully dangerous working conditions are,
efforts to ban them simply by imposing standards from outside could easily
increase deprivation in really poor countries where no alternative legal
source of family income exists. Such efforts would in any case be credible
only if backed by threat of sanctions, which would risk further
impoverishing third-world economies and the people the new social conditions
regime is in theory designed to assist.
Real living and working standards in less developed countries will rise only
if their economic welfare is first enhanced. One way is through much bigger
aid and resource transfers than the west seems disposed to contemplate. A
better one is to encourage the poorest countries to generate wealth by
allowing them to benefit from unimpeded private capital flows into their
economies and to export freely on world markets. That requires the west to
keep trade barriers low, not to erect new ones.
There may nonetheless be a case for broad-ranging discussion of workers'
rights in the WTO. That would raise awareness about the importance of humane
working conditions, while allowing the international community to identify
in an open forum what scope exists for actions which would genuinely promote
the economic development of poorer countries. Placing the matter firmly in a
multilateral framework could restrain industrialised countries from using
labour standards as an alibi for unilateral trade discrimination, and force
them to defend such measures publicly. The debate would expose self-serving
protectionist arguments for what they are.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Personal View: Labour needs to prove love of markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Labour party says that it has come to love the market. Labour's
leading figures proclaim they are committed to the mixed economy. But can we
believe them? The party's attitude to the government's public sector reforms
shows a deep-seated and enduring hostility. Labour continues to oppose
market-type reforms in public services such as health and education.
Yet evidence that such reforms can improve the quality of public services is
growing nationally and internationally. This should make reform attractive
to a party committed to raising standards.
And market-type reforms appear to offer the only way of reconciling the
conflicting pressures public services are under. Voters increasingly expect
public services to be more responsive to their individual needs, as many
private sector services have become. At the same time, they seem to have
become reluctant to vote for higher taxes to pay for better services. So
parties that promise to improve public services must explain how they will
do it without raising taxes.
Market-type reforms offer the solution by creating competition between
suppliers of public services such as hospitals and schools. One immediate
consequence is that the users can choose the type of service they prefer. If
these organisations are rewarded according to the number of users they
attract, they have incentives to meet individual needs.
But competition also provides incentives for greater efficiency, especially
if the suppliers are given the same sort of managerial freedom enjoyed by
entrepreneurs in the private sector. More public services can be provided
for the same budget if costs can be cut.
For reasons such as these, governments of left and right, from Labor
Australia to the UK Conservatives, have adopted what is known in the jargon
as the purchaser/provider split in public services. The organisations that
supply public services, the providers, are separated from those that
commission and pay for them, the purchasers.
The purchasers shop around among the providers to find the best value for
money in internal markets. Providers compete for a share of the budget by
striving to meet the needs of the users.
The attractiveness of this strategy is hardly surprising. If market
competition can raise efficiency, encourage innovation and cultivate concern
for the customer in private sector services, it can provide similar benefits
in the public services.
Yet Labour has repeatedly attacked market-type reforms in *something in here
(HP) *
services such as health and education. Typically it describes them as
'commercialising' these services, distorting provision through competition
and creating two-tier services. The very use of the term 'commercialising'
in this negative sense betrays Labour's underlying attitude to the market.
The purpose of public services is not changed by the introduction of
internal markets. In most cases, they remain available according to the
need, free at the point of use.
The claim that the internal market distorts provision is just another way of
calling for a return to central planning. It suggests that Labour still
thinks bureaucrats in Whitehall, regional health authorities or town halls
know best how to spend taxpayers' money.
And the accusation of a two-tier service is another way of demanding
equality of outcome, something that most people are unlikely to find
attractive. One of the merits of internal markets is that they produce
different outcomes as providers are rewarded for meeting individual needs.
Some providers will be more successful than others in raising standards. But
this does not mean creating a two-tier system forever: those that are less
successful will have to improve their performance if they are not to lose
customers. Such incentives are largely absent in top-down administered
public services.
This is not to deny that there can be undesirable side-effects of
market-type reforms. An active competition policy is needed to stop
monopolists or cartels milking the taxpayer. Transaction costs can rise
excessively, especially if reforms artificially separate functions without
introducing real competition.
The most serious fear for Labour is that such reforms will reduce equity, a
key value for a party of the left. This would happen if providers began to
exclude people who make greater demands on them ('cream-skimming').
But cream-skimming can be best handled within the internal market, by
increasing payments for people who make greater demands on public services.
This gives providers an incentive to take them on, manipulating the market
intelligently to achieve desired outcomes.
Sadly, Labour finds it hard to think positively about how to use market
forces in public services. The party's endorsement of the market economy
will be hollow until it concedes that market-based reforms of the public
services can yield similar benefits to those generated in the private
sector.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Sunrise approaches after long darkness: A tentative,
consumer-led economic recovery is at last in sight in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is, for the first time in many months, a cheerful holiday mood at
Tokyo's Narita airport.
Japanese tourists wearing flowery Hawaiian shirts mingle with the sober
business suited crowds, testimony to a sharp rise in foreign holiday
bookings this spring, to more than twice last year's level.
Most of those holidays are being sold cheap, so travel agents are not much
richer. Yet Narita's colourful tourists are among the growing number of
indications in recent weeks that Japan is near the end of an economic
downturn which began in mid-1991, the longest in the post-war years.
Government forecasters are understandably reluctant to predict the timing of
the upturn, since some of them rejoiced at signs of recovery this time last
year, which only turned out to be the heralds of a double-dip recession.
Yet many private sector forecasters, especially foreign ones, are confident
that the recession, as defined by more than two consecutive quarters of
decline, touched bottom in the final quarter of 1993. Then gross domestic
product fell by 2.2 per cent compared with the same period in the previous
year, producing full year growth of a mere 0.1 per cent, the worst figure
since 1974.
The mean private sector forecast is for a gentle rebound to 0.3 per cent
growth this year, propelled by a rise in consumer spending, which is at last
responding to the government's four economic pump-priming packages worth a
total of Y45,000bn (Dollars 422bn) over the past 16 months.
If the forecasts are right, this will be the first time since the war that
Japan will have had a recovery led by a rise in domestic consumption alone,
rather than higher industrial production in response to export demand. This
means the upturn will be shallower than previous ones, says the head of a
leading Japanese securities company.
Yet nobody doubts, as Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, told
a seminar this week, that the conditions for recovery are at long last in
place. 'This is at least the end of the decline,' adds Mr Hirohiko Okumura,
chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. Whether it is the beginning of
the upturn, however, is an open question, he says.
The most important green shoot to look for is industrial output, because it
represents around a third of economic activity. Production fell, on an
annualised basis, for a record 28 months in a row until the latest count in
January. But month-on-month, January picked up slightly from December and
the Bank of Japan says it expects a strong recovery in the first quarter of
this year.
Mr Kagehide Kaku, the central bank's chief economist, says that if this
forecast rebound in output does occur, he expects a general recovery in the
early summer.
On the strength of all this, corporate Japan is beginning to feel less
gloomy about the future. Business confidence sank to the lowest recorded in
this recession last November - minus 22.1 on a scale representing the
percentage balance of pessimists and optimists, according to a quarterly
survey by the Bank of Japan, but picked up slightly to minus 13.1 last
month. A sign that companies are at last getting busier is a break in a
four-month fall in the ratio of job offers to applicants. The number of jobs
on offer per 100 people rose from 65 in December to 67 in January.
Average corporate profits, now in their fourth year of decline, appear to be
following a similar trajectory. They fell 21.6 per cent in the year to the
third quarter of 1993, but showed they might be pulling out of the curve,
with a smaller 6.2 per cent decline in the fourth quarter.
Consumer demand is more vigorous. A new feature, not present in last
spring's phantom upturn, is a strong recovery in housing starts, apparent
since last summer. Much of this was fuelled by cheap lending from the
government's Housing Loans Corporation - which provides 80 per cent of
Japanese mortgages - a sign that the government's pump-priming packages are
starting to take effect.
This has fed through into a rise in consumer spending - up 0.7 per cent from
the third to the final quarters of last year - as new home owners have
started to equip their dwellings.
Existing home owners have also started to spend more, as they relax after
having paid off some debts built up during the late 1980s spending spree.
For the first time, household personal debt fell in the year to December
1992, by Y1,000bn to Y340,500bn, according to S G Warburg Securities in
Tokyo.
The fact that consumer spending rose faster than wages in the final quarter
of last year may indicate that the cautious Japanese have sufficient
confidence to chip into their high savings rate, argues Mr Robert Feldman,
director of economic research at Salomon Brothers Asia. 'The economy has
shifted from neutral into first or second gear,' he believes.
Yet, in the medium term, there is unlikely to be a return to the good old
days. There is plenty of evidence that Japan's economy will drive out of
this recession weaker than before. Most forecasters expect GDP growth to
stabilise at 2 to 3 per cent annually for the rest of the decade, below the
4 per cent average for the 1980s.
The big feature in Japan's reduced ability to grow is the heavy surplus
industrial capacity inherited from over-investment in the 1980s and worsened
by Japanese industry's switch to cheaper production sites overseas in the
1990s. This has strained Japan's tradition of lifetime employment, but not
enough to let it slim capacity and costs on the scale of its US and European
corporate competitors and hence improve its profitability in line with
theirs.
New capital investment in Japanese industry is falling sharply, down 13.2
per cent between the third and fourth quarters of last year, for the ninth
three-month period in a row, but unemployment has only crept up a fraction,
from 2.1 per cent in 1991, the first year of the recession, to 2.5 per cent
last year.
The jobless rate would double if corporate Japan fired all its surplus
workforce, according to an estimate by the Keidanren business organisation.
In short, Japanese industry has cut into the fat, but not the bone.
Companies have, of course, had to restrain wage growth to be able to afford
this high level of employment. The current annual national wage round will
settle on a 3 per cent rise, the worst in nominal terms since the second
world war.
This is not as bad for consumers as it looks since inflation is much lower
than the official rate of 1.3 per cent, because the government does not
count discount stores, the fastest growing retail sector, in its
calculations.
Many analysts believe prices might even be falling at 1 per cent a year,
though a recent rise in utility bills could change that. Wage growth will,
in any event, continue to be constrained by high costs, fears the Bank of
Japan. 'We are still straddled with a heavy adjustment burden,' warns Mr
Mieno, the bank's governor.
Another problem, which was not present in previous recoveries, is the risk
of a credit squeeze. Banks are reluctant to lend more to companies until
they have reduced the mountain of non-performing loans they acquired by
lending too much on the back of over-valued property in the late 1980s. On
present rates of write off, they need three to seven years - depending on
the bank - to reduce bad debts to a manageable size, the finance ministry
estimates.
Japan's top 21 banks admit they have up to Y13,700bn in bad loans, though
this is widely thought to be an underestimate. But even this official figure
represents a bigger burden on Japan's economy than, relatively speaking,
were the US banking system's debts at the depth of the American banking
crisis. Japanese banks' bad debts represent 2.9 per cent of gross national
product, as against the 1.8 per cent of US GNP represented by US banks'
non-performing loans in mid-1991, according to the Bank of Japan.
On balance, Japan's recovery is likely to be too tentative to produce the
early increase in demand which would satisfy US government pressure for a
significant fall in the record current account surplus. That will keep up
the pressure on the yen which, at last week's closing rate of Y105 to the
dollar, forces many companies in Japan's export-dependent economy into a
loss. However, the yen is unlikely to show the startling rise in value which
it did last year, one of the main reasons why that apparent recovery came to
nothing.
'There is no doubt that we are at the bottom,' says Mr Jesper Koll, chief
economist at S G Warburg in Tokyo. 'But it may turn out to be a corrugated
bottom, followed by a joyless recovery.'

Britain's credit card companies may be dilatory about charging interest more
in line with bank rates; but some are sensitive toward debtors.
Take the Co-operative Bank's latest leaflet, touting its Gold Visa card. It
offers a 'free additional card' so 'you and your partner share the shame
credit limit'. No stigma attached.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: Maori mover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of New Zealand's more colourful characters, Dame Whina Cooper, who spent
a lifetime defending Maori rights, has died at the age of 98.
Born on a mud floor in a Maori cookhouse in December 1895, she founded the
Maori Women's Welfare League in the 1950s but sprang to national prominence
in 1975, when - in her eighth decade - she led a protest march of 5,000
Maoris from her Northland home to Wellington's parliament. Her nightly
television appearances, hobbling with a walking stick on the 650-mile trek,
brought her national fame.
Maori activists later clashed bitterly with her, when she accepted a string
of honours; independent to the end, she ignored her critics.
Prime Minister Jim Bolger plans to attend her funeral this week; a noble
gesture, given that in 1991 she told him that his sacking of Maori affairs
minister Winston Peters would bring him curses from Satan.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How much should be made of last week's meeting between John Major and Lady
Thatcher's press secretary at Number 10, Sir Bernard Ingham? Nothing at all,
says the still formidable Sir Bernard. 'I go to see him from time to time as
a friend of mine,' he says. 'I am not operating in any advisory capacity.'
Quite a number of Tory MPs will think that rather a pity. With the
government lurching from crisis to crisis, they are increasingly nostalgic
for the smack of firm leadership that Lady Thatcher, aided by her inimitably
gruff press supremo, usually provided.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: McKinsey's man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the subject of sleuthing, try tackling McKinsey, the publicity-shy
management consulting firm, about its new top dog. Partners of the firm have
just picked Rajat Gupta, 45, as their new primus inter pares. He has
declined to talk to journalists, and the firm released only the barest cv.
Indian-born but a long-standing US citizen, Gupta attended Harvard, ran
McKinsey's Scandinavian offices for a while in the mid-1980s and has been
head of the Chicago operation since 1989. What big assignments has he led?
Don't even bother asking.
Mind you, reading the runes makes Gupta look an interesting choice. Names
more commonly mentioned for the job had been Don Waite - head of the bigger
New York office - and non-US consultants like Herbert Henzler, in charge of
the German operation.
But McKinsey increasingly looks for its income outside the US, and the
choice of Gupta hints at continuing that trend. Provided he survives
re-election every three years, he could be around a long time.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: Silent mole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's the stuff of a John Le Carre novel: who is the mole within that august
institution, the London Stock Exchange?
It's emerged that last December chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith - who steps
down on July 14 - found it necessary to hire those well-known sleuths, Kroll
Associates.
Their mission? To track down the source of a number of leaks to the press -
the FT included - about sensitive high-level appointments.
Kroll snooped around but to no avail it seems. Observer's man tells us that
Kroll's report does not point the finger at any individual: 'Kroll had an
open brief to investigate widely but found no single source. Something
happened, somebody talked, but who exactly, that's a different matter.'
That's the trouble with moles - never talking when you want them to.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: Black's moves to pinkness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper tycoons are ambitiously energetic types, and Conrad Black, who
controls the Telegraph group, is no exception. The US, Canada, Israel and
Australia - he has interests there as well as the UK.
Black's interests are widespread, as is illustrated by an intriguing story
only now surfacing. More than a year ago he held discussions with Emap, the
UK regional newspaper and magazine group run by Robin Miller, about
launching a new British financial daily. There was even a name pencilled in
to edit it - former Financial Times journalist Clive Wolman, now financial
editor of the Mail on Sunday.
Word is, Black and Miller were not planning a full frontal assault on the
FT, but were instead looking at a mid-market tabloid format. The idea died,
apparently because it was thought not to be viable. But 'never say never'
might well be Black's motto . . .

FT  28 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Late payment of bills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Late payment of bills is a recurrent problem for businesses across most of
Europe. But it is at its worst in the UK, where delays in settling invoices
have become endemic. The practice plays havoc with cashflow, kills off
thousands of smaller enterprises every year and wastes immense amounts of
time in chasing unpaid bills.
That much is easy to state. Finding effective ways of tackling this business
headache is harder. The UK government issued a consultative paper after the
November Budget exploring the options, including a statutory right to
interest on overdue payments. There has been vigorous lobbying over the
issue during the consultation period, which ends on Thursday. But when it
comes to assessing the responses, the Department of Trade and Industry is
likely to find that there is still no consensus over the use of legislation.
The Confederation of British Industry, for example, opposes legislation  - a
stance that is backed by its small business committee. The Federation of
Small Businesses would back it only after other measures have been tried. In
favour of immediate legislation are the Forum of Private Business and the
Institute of Directors. Large and small businesses are on both sides of the
divide.
Poor record
The arguments in favour of legislation are seductive. The UK has one of the
worst records in Europe for late payment, perhaps because most other
European countries have a statutory right to interest on overdue payments. A
survey by Dun and Bradstreet, the business information company, says that UK
companies have to wait on average 20 days longer beyond the due date than
their French counterparts, the next-worst payers in Europe. The CBI says
that late payment threatens the survival of one in five companies. More than
Pounds 15bn of trade debts to small and medium-sized businesses are overdue
at any one time, according to Lord Alexander, chairman of National
Westminster bank.
The impact is greatest on smaller businesses that can least afford to press
the large customers upon whom they depend for orders. They lack the
resources to chase up late payments, which larger companies control through
efficient debt management strategies. And factoring may be too expensive for
such businesses. Yet their prosperity is essential to the economy; small and
medium-sized enterprises will provide most of the jobs needed to bring
unemployment down.
Legal rights
However, it is not clear that a statutory right to interest on overdue debt
is an effective remedy. Debt payment times have lengthened in some countries
that have legislation, such as Germany. There, few companies exercise their
legal rights because it would jeopardise their relationship with the
customer. The introduction of statutory interest in the UK might simply
lengthen the payment times that large companies are prepared to agree with
their suppliers. European companies typically demand longer settlement dates
than their British counterparts.
And if legislation is likely to be infrequently used, or sidestepped by
changes in payment terms, then alternative strategies for improving payment
of bills might be more effective. Government departments, for example, must
now give details of their payment practices in their annual reports: larger
companies might be required to do the same. A British standard on prompt
payment could enforce such transparency and set standards for good practice.
Trade associations could be supported in helping their members combat late
payment. The DTI has already provided Pounds 30,000 to the Federation of
Master Builders to pay for a helpline that advises members on how to recover
debts. Guidance is also offered on how to check the creditworthiness of
potential customers. More of this could be done at no great cost.
If such measures have little success, the case for a statutory right to
interest would be much stronger. It would then be clear, as Lord Alexander
wrote in the FT in September, that legislation was needed to change the
culture. But until the alternatives have been fully tried, legislation
should be avoided. A combination of publicity and peer pressure is the most
attractive option for the DTI.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Business leaders' dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ALEXANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr P V Zealander (Letters, March 17) is right about the dearth of
biographies of modern business leaders. In our view, modesty may well
explain the situation, but certainly not lack of interest.
Some interviews we recently conducted with business leaders suggest,
however, that biographies of top men and women would not (unless they were
just publicising themselves) offer one single formula for creating wealth
and achieving power. What they could do, on the other hand, is to throw
light on some of the real dilemmas these people face. For example, how do
they resist interfering when they think they already have the answer? And
how do they reconcile listening with being and appearing decisive?
It seems to be a lot more complicated than a simple list of dos and don'ts.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr L G BROOKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Energy efficiency advocates like Mr Andrew Warren (Letters, March 24)
persist in depicting the normal operation of energy markets as barriers to
energy efficiency. 'Energy tariffs,' they say, 'are too low.'
By what criterion? If suppliers are prepared to offer fuel at these prices
and consumers to take up the offer, the market is doing its job of
contributing to general economic efficiency.
It is up to energy efficiency advocates to justify setting markets aside,
remembering that more efficient use is not the same thing as reduced
consumption. As distinguished American economist Robert Solow has pointed
out: 'Factor augmentation does not mean factor saving.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / Ten commandments from the OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The orthodox belief today is that something called structural reform is the
key to improving performance, and to combining increased efficiency with
lower unemployment. It usually means opening economies more to market
forces.
Yet such policies are difficult to write about in a way that excites
attention. It becomes either a matter of general slogans, or a mass of
industry and country detail of numbing boredom from which one cannot
generalise.
The secretariat of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development has thus performed a service in publishing an overall appraisal
(Assessing Structural Reform: Lessons for the Future). It contains 10
lessons from experience, to give the subject a sharper focus.
It is still not free of OECD-speak - perhaps the cloudy terminology is an
attempt to avoid stirring up opposition from politicians who have made a
career out of hostility to market forces. I can perform a slight service by
translating the dialect. In what follows, the sentences in heavy type are
the OECD's own words:
1. Lack of attention to incentives can lead to large costs.
This means many kinds of intervention can create rewards for those who are
ingenious in getting around them. For example, credit controls have been
worn down by new non-bank institutions, falling outside the scope of the
regulations, that have met customer needs. 2. Changed circumstances can turn
reasonable policies into costly ones.
In other words, a programme to buy off interest groups can become
prohibitively expensive if circumstances change. The main example is
agriculture. Competitors from outside Europe have depressed world prices and
increased the cost of European farming support.
3. Delaying reform because of vested interests can increase transition
costs.
The longer you delay, the more interest groups become dependent on
protection and the more expensive it is to buy them off. The US-Japan
voluntary car export restraint agreement led to a transfer from American
consumers to producers of Dollars 2.6bn in 1984.
4. International integration cannot be avoided and will help improve
efficiency by inhibiting rent seeking and promoting competition.
This mouthful means producers cannot reliably protect themselves by tariffs
and quotas. Overseas competitors will usually get round them by direct
investment, joint ventures and so on. In the meantime, because state aid has
been concentrated in key sectors - such as agriculture, steel, shipbuilding
and textiles - western economies have been given a perverse twist towards
activities that should be fading into the sunset.
5. Adjustment costs need to be recognised.
The costs of reform are concentrated on small, noisy groups and often come
before the benefits. These groups often need to be, and sometimes even
should be, bought off by social transfers.
6. Technological change may reduce the need for, or change the nature of,
government intervention.
A good example is telecommunications which are no longer natural monopolies
because there are now so many ways of transmitting information; and in
broadcasting, spectrum shortage has become a thing of the past. 7. Budget
constraints can help avoid bad policies.
Citizens' dislike of extra taxes is an effective obstacle to proliferating
intervention. In the UK, the biggest inhibition on the Department of Trade
and Industry from trying to back 'winners' and provide back-door subsidies
is Treasury cash ceilings. Yet the OECD warns us not to rely too much on
these constraints. Governments were able to get away with agricultural
policies costing taxpayers and consumers Dollars 1,750bn between 1986 and
1991 partly because some costs did not appear in government budgets and were
paid by consumers in prices well above world levels.
8. The service sector will increasingly be a focus for structural reform.
Reform is particularly necessary because services are more sheltered from
foreign trade than manufacturing; and differences between productivity in
different countries are much bigger in some service sectors than in
industry. 9. Non-economic factors can influence the nature and speed of
reform.
This refers to the need to sell free market reforms, which are not always
immediately attractive to the electorate. Former New Zealand Labour prime
minister David Lange did so in the 1980s by combining it with radical
slogans about a non-nuclear south Pacific. Lady Thatcher did it in the UK
with the almost opposite technique of allying free markets with national
self-assertion. We shall soon know if Silvio Berlusconi has managed to sell
a combination of free market reform, regional separatism and the lingering
Italian desire for a strong leader.
10. There can be synergies between structural reform and macroeconomic
environments.
In times of prosperity, reforms will not be undertaken because there is no
apparent need. In times of depression, they may be postponed to avoid
unemployment. But if these obstacles can be overcome, structural reform can
help macro-economic policies. For instance, if labour markets are flexible,
pay and prices adjust more quickly to monetary squeezes, and inflation can
then be cured more easily and at smaller cost in temporary unemployment.
The OECD has still not discovered the secret of golden speech. Many of the
examples could just as easily have gone into one category rather than
another. But at least the attempt has been made.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Dangers of western gullibility: Boris Fyodorov argues the
sooner Russia receives aid, the sooner policy will change - for the worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BORIS FYODOROV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When one reflects on the events of the past five years, one begins to doubt
if the west is really interested in Russia becoming an efficient market
economy with a normal democratic political system. The signals are
disturbing.
When Yegor Gaidar's government was pushing forward in 1992, the west was
deliberating. When progress was being made in 1993, we discussed
stabilisation targets. But now Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme
nationalist, is elected to parliament, the west talks of disbursements.
Former US President Richard Nixon comes to Moscow to embrace the ex-jail
birds (the leaders of last year's failed coup), who showed themselves so
bloodthirsty in the recent past. This certainly confuses many people here.
Russian communists go to the US - that staunch bastion of western democracy
 -and lots of people are enchanted and call them social democrats. But do
they read the communists' programme?
Western countries issue visas to Zhirinovsky and even talk about taming him
through embracing him. This smacks of Munich. Let's not forget his plans
about nuking some nations, changing borders, washing soldiers' boots in the
Indian ocean.
US President Bill Clinton's former room-mate at Oxford, now deputy secretary
of state Strobe Talbott, coins a Soviet-type slogan: 'Less shock and more
therapy.' Many people in the west, it seems, prefer to close their eyes to
the simple fact that there never was any shock therapy, ever, in Russia.
I have the feeling that the west often sees Russia through a distorted
looking-glass, and sometimes applies to Russia different criteria for what
makes a democracy or a normal market economy.
Today, after the agreement on the next round of financial assistance to the
Russian government (via the International Monetary Fund), I again see that
some in the west are misinterpreting the political situation here, and want
to sacrifice economic reform for illusory political dividends.
Is it not clear that, for three months, not a single reform or even a simple
economic policy measure has been enacted? Is it not clear that the west is
being used to bury the remnants of the reforms? Is it not clear that a
change in economic policy already affects foreign and domestic policy? Is it
not clear that anti-western and nationalist attitudes are becoming more and
more prevalent?
I believe that, in 1993, our relations with the west were developing in the
right direction. For me, it was not so much money but moral support that
mattered. That is why when we saw, last August, that our targets had not
been achieved, I was the first to alert the IMF and our government - though
it would have been easy to cook the figures and get the money. We decided
not to lie to ourselves and to the world.
But now that the IMF has extended the second tranche of the systemic
transformation facility, on the grounds that it will be politically
beneficial to the west, I say: lock up the advisers who give such counsel
and throw away the key.
The sooner this money is handed over, the sooner we shall see a change in
policy - in the wrong direction. I recall how Mikhail Gorbachev, after each
new loan, would lose interest in any kind of economic reform.
The Dollars 1.5bn is immaterial to Russia, given the scale of its problems,
and would be eaten up in a matter of minutes. Its importance is that it
would be taken as a seal of approval on 'corrections' to the policy.
This is now a purely political matter. The stakes are high. The idea is to
abandon western-type economic policies, with western approval. Enemies of
reform go against their very nature to curb credit in order to get the loan.
The externals may be different on the outside - but the substance is the
same. IMF representatives are bullied, made to wait for hours by nonentities
in reception rooms, and then are treated to a lesson in geography, as a map
is spread to show how big Russia is and therefore how much it needs special
treatment.
Please do not believe western experts who claim - just as our nationalists
do - that Russia is so special that nothing from the civilised world applies
to it. That is stupid: inflation is inflation in any country. Those who want
Russia to move more 'gradually' than now should come here and try to live on
an average Russian salary for two years.
Will the west be gullible or hypocritical? Will it play the game? I do not
know - but I think western taxpayers have a right to know how and to what
ends their money is being spent, when they have problems of their own back
home.
This means that a budget should first be approved by parliament, and the new
government's track record examined. The government's performance on
inflation - that is, the rate for which it is responsible, not the one it
inherited from last year - starts only in May, because of the three or
four-month time lag between credit policies and the inflation resulting from
them. There is no valid reason to hurry before being reasonably sure that
this government's new virtue is real.
I would not advise minimising the importance of the debt rescheduling. There
are too many people in senior positions in the Russian government who think
it patriotic to take as many loans as possible and then quietly plot about
debt forgiveness and debt reduction.
In 1993, we resisted doing this, by reducing borrowings and refusing even to
talk about debt forgiveness. I do not believe in compensation for local
incompetence, and sometimes corruption, in matters of external finance. I
think it is important for creditors to be sure that fiscal discipline is in
place, and that obligations will really be honoured.
I support President Boris Yeltsin and am committed up to the hilt to the
reforms. But I am sure that a weakening of the western position on
stabilisation will be detrimental to my country.

decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A W BEHRENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, BAT Industries on Thursday announced that its dividend will be paid as
foreign income dividend, which means that it is now effectively a gross
amount. In order to protect the position of both taxpayers and
non-taxpayers, the rate has been increased from 12.2p to 15.25p.
Although this will make no difference to the vast majority of holders,
charities, all of which benefit from transitional relief in respect of the
change in advance corporation tax rate, will suffer. I understand the
Treasury has insisted that only one rate be paid; consequently, charities
will lose out, as they will be unable to claim this relief.
Surely the authorities should give further consideration to this problem.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read that Sir John Banham is advocating the
abolition of the Treasury ('Banham calls for Treasury abolition', March 21).
When I proposed this desirable change some years ago (including in your
Letters page), it was greeted with a certain amount of derision. I was not
sure even that Mr Banham (as he was then) was convinced, when I put it to
him during a coffee break at one of the Anglo-German Konigswinter
conferences in Cambridge some time in the mid to late 1980s.
I have not read his book, but I do not think that his proposed institutional
arrangements would work. The Treasury should become the Ministry of
Economics, and a new financially literate and numerate Ministry of Finance
should deal with budgeting and control. With other much-needed tidying up of
departments to produce greater focus and co-ordination, there need be no net
increase in either departments or staff, and the changes would make
co-ordination with other EU states simpler.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pension funds must heed equities
volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT C ROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'More or less safe pensions' (March 23), draws attention
to the very important shift of emphasis in the valuation of pension fund
assets. The possible introduction of a minimum solvency standard, combined
with the advancing maturity of many pension funds, means that the focus is
increasingly on the market value of assets rather than the assumed value of
the future income streams, which have been the measure of health in the
past.
The effective smoothing of stock market volatility by actuaries has allowed
the average UK pension fund to invest up to 85 per cent of its assets in
equities without embarrassment. Many commentators have suggested that mature
pension funds, in which the difference between full funding and insolvency
may be modest, should reduce their equity exposures. I would broadly agree
with this preliminary conclusion, and would like to draw attention to the
other important investment consideration, which is where the equities should
be invested.
UK pension funds invest almost 70 per cent of their equities in the UK
market. About 90 per cent of the volatility in UK equities is smoothed out
by the actuarial methodology. By contrast, the same methodology has
virtually no impact on the volatility of international equities, ie there is
a huge bias in favour of UK equities introduced by the smoothing process.
In the new world of market values, the full impact of volatility in both UK
and international equity markets will be felt by pensions funds. Thus to
have 70 per cent of the fund's exposure in a single market could appear very
risky. Any objective analysis of the effect of international
diversification, in which UK and international equities are treated
consistently, will show that UK exposure should be reduced, perhaps to 50-60
per cent of total equities. The UK equity component may be lower still if
the currency exposure of the international investments is hedged back to
sterling.
Mr Eric Lambert's letter (March 24) is interesting in this regard. It
confirms that many of the funds which his company monitors are maturing.
However, I do not believe he will have observed as yet any reduction in
average equity exposures or change in the split between UK and
international. While it is interesting to know how the consensus invests,
this does not necessarily mean it is right, nor that it is appropriate for
most pension funds. It is a fantasy to believe one's position in a league
table will be the prime measure of success or failure in the future.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: Shame about the maestros - Vienna Philharmonic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Austria waits patiently for confirmation of its entry into the
European Union, the country's leading orchestra has already crossed the
threshold. Since last year the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra has committed
itself to an annual European series of concerts, taking it regularly to
Paris, Berlin and the Royal Festival Hall in London.
At the start it must have looked a foolproof project. The orchestra could
play the role of Austria's cultural ambassador, exporting music of the
highest quality around Europe. Unfortunately, people who thought they were
being guaranteed concerts which were automatically superior have had a cruel
disappointment. Nothing that the Vienna Philharmonic has done so far has
lived up to memories of its visits in the 1970s and 1980s with conductors
such as Bohm, Jochum and Bernstein.
This is not the orchestra's fault. The standard of its playing remains at
the top of the league, but the feted maestros that it has brought with it
seem unable to draw from the players anything beyond technical excellence.
The effect is like window-shopping in Karntnerstrasse, Vienna's premier
street. The symphonies and tone poems are dressed like mannequins in the
finest orchestral clothes, the cut exquisite, the textures luxurious, the
quality simply the best, but the music within remains as lifeless as any
shop-window dummy.
Any one of our British orchestras would be proud to have a violin section
that could phrase the opening of the slow movement to Schubert's Sixth
Symphony as elegantly as the Vienna Philharmonic does. The balance of the
wind on the movement's final chord was hardly less impressive. But even this
unexceptional symphony should have some inner life. Zubin Mehta's
performance vied with Levine's Brahms of last year as the most deadening in
the five concerts to date.
Mehta's taste is for musical extravagance. Maybe the Schubert was only
included to give the audience some respite between two works of massive
excess, Wagner's Overture to Rienzi and Strauss's Sinfonia domestica. The
Strauss employs one of the largest orchestras ever used. Mehta knows how to
marshal gargantuan forces like these and the performance was saturated in
lush textures, glorious climaxes and de luxe ensemble.
In the end, however, this concert left the intellect sleeping, the heart
unmoved. Perhaps it is unfair to ask that a work as overblown as the Strauss
should yield any deeper rewards, but probing a score's depths has never
really been Mehta's forte. In none of the concerts that I have heard in
these series has this marvellous orchestra penetrated to the heart of a
great piece of music. Somewhere there must be a conductor who can show them
the way.
The VPO's next concert
in London is on April 25

FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: History means business - Britain is losing a real
sense of its past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the United Kingdom slipping quietly into the role of the historical theme
park of Europe? When we first joined the European Union there were many
sceptics who predicted that Britain's future was clearly marked out as a
museum of industry. How far have the sceptics been proved right and how far
has the British appetite for history been allowed to sap our energy for the
future?
Last week this page recorded the opening of the latest display at the Tower
of London - the new Jewel House for the glittering baubles of our Imperial
past - which are now shown in a way that combines theatre, the movies and a
modicum of history. It is, of course, all in the cause of tourism - millions
of visitors have, by the sheer weight of their numbers, set in motion the
machine of profit and bureaucracy that will ultimately remove any real sense
of the past.
In 1989 the Historic Royal Palaces agency was set up to run five unoccupied
royal palaces as an independent and profitable business: Hampton Court
Palace, Kew Palace, the Tower of London, Kensington Palace (the state
apartments only) and the Banqueting House in Whitehall. Since the agency's
formation, a great deal has happened, with restorations and improvements
brought about to ensure that more people visit more of the palaces, and that
each visit is, in some way, made more rewarding.
Curiously, it was the fire at Hampton Court Place in 1986 and the subsequent
restoration of the King's Apartments that put the new agency on the map. The
decision was taken to carry out six years of highly skilled restoration
under the inspired direction of a new young curator, Mr Simon Thurley. His
decision to present the rooms at Hampton Court exactly as they were left by
Sir Christopher Wren, in response to the original commission of King William
III, was the right one. Thurley has been much aided by the textile
conservation studio, which is based at Hampton Court, and by the general
wish to see the palace not merely as a series of empty rooms but as a place
where monarchs once lived. The inspiration for the approach at Hampton Court
is the palace of Versailles, where the painstaking restoration and
rejuvenation of the royal apartments began in the 1970s.
The search for authenticity is, however, an entirely elusive thing. No
amount of research can precisely capture the way the royal palaces were
used. I have written in the past about the highly dubious restoration that
went on in the Queen's House at Greenwich, where there was little genuine
decoration or furniture. There were some inexcusable things at Greenwich -
the photographic copy of ceiling murals, the cheap gilded furniture and
everywhere inexpensive materials masquerading as 'authentic' ones.
The quality of the work at Hampton Court is in a different league. The raw
materials are better but so is the taste and the judgment. There are some
grey areas - the costumed guides do smack of a Disney experience and the
sensation of everything looking new is curiously neat and depressing. I
wonder what foreign visitors really make of the smart apartments? I am old
enough to remember the sense of enjoying the old and the shabby at Hampton
Court and also the sense of discovery that comes from not being organised
and steered as a visitor, of making one's own discoveries. I will never
forget the first time, as the only person there on a winter visit, I looked
down into the Chapel at Hampton Court.
The people I have spoken to at Historic Royal Palaces are full of the word,
'reinterpretation'. It is a word that is also much in vogue at the National
Trust. It involves freezing palaces, parks and rooms at a certain moment in
history.
We are going to see a good example of this at Kensington Palace soon, when
the King's Gallery will be 'restored' to the William Kent designs with white
and gold panelling, with pictures rehung in William Kent frames. This room
will in fact be new but will be described as a restoration. We are on thin
ice here and in danger of losing all sense of the marks of time on the walls
of our ancient palaces. At Kensington Palace there will also be special
'themed' tours. You will be able to plug into an architectural tour or a
costume tour or even a play that will relay the past via your 'Walkman' as
you pace the newly polished floors.
The past was once seen as a delicate thing that had to be gently nurtured
and largely left alone. Now the past is a business and is doing well
drumming up the visitors in numbers large enough to kill the things they
love. I often feel like a lone voice - I actually like decay and signs of
wear and age. I like undiscovered and uninterpreted history. It is the sound
byte of history that we are experiencing today. As I went past the Crown of
England on the travelator at the Tower, I knew that all sense of real
mystery and significance of that once sacred object had gone for ever. Is
that what is happening as we sanitise and restore so much of the past?
Making all things new and then reinterpreting them as old is a baffling way
to maintain a sense of history. But then, perhaps I'm in need of a bit of
restoration myself.

Having originally concent-rated almost entirely on the musical abilities of
its contestants, BBC2's Young Musician Of The Year competition was then
turned into a second rate chat show. The presenter would take the musicians
out on pretty locations and inquire earnestly about their hobbies. Naturally
enough music lovers switched off in their droves, but mindless gossip freaks
switched on. Which way will it go this year, with the competition held for
the first time in Birmingham? We shall see today when the first semi-final
(pianists) is televised (6.50).
It is fashionable to criticise Jeremy Brett for having turned England's most
famous detective into an over-emotional poseur, but to me The Memoirs Of
Sherlock Holmes still seems the best screen interpretation ever made.
Today's case: 'The Red Circle' (9.00 ITV).
Given the high quality of Malcolm Brinkworth's documentaries about British
ex-pats living in Spain, his new pair of programmes about the British in the
Dordogne, A French Affair, ought to be worth watching (9.00 C4).

FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: Spring Loaded - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's independent dance scene used to be the counter-culture territory
of young choreographers and performers who had little interest in finding a
place in the established contemporary dance companies. During the past few
years, however, this supposedly alternative scene has also become a home for
restless dissidents of mainstream organisations.
Jeremy James, Mark Baldwin, Gary Lambert and Ben Craft, all former members
of Rambert Dance Company, now operate as independent choreographer-dancers.
And all, in recent weeks, have presented evenings of their own work in the
Spring Loaded season at the Place Theatre, London's busiest venue for
independent dance. Ironically, it is these artists - relative newcomers to
the scene - who are responsible for some of the most noteworthy and
individualistic work in this year's Spring Loaded.
Not everything served up by Lambert and Craft (as Small Axe), Baldwin
(directing half a dozen ex-Rambert colleagues), and Jeremy James (sharing a
bill with versatile freelancer Jo Chandler) could be described as
heaven-sent. But the flaws and weaknesses are, to a great extent, diluted by
a combination of intelligence and autonomy.
Cold Ground Drifting is the latest offering from Small Axe, the ensemble set
up in 1992 by Lambert and Craft as a vehicle for their joint choreographic
efforts. Like last year's rambling trail From New Malden to Upminster, Cold
Ground Drifting invites its audience on a journey, transporting us to
various, unspecific, but mostly hostile and deprived areas of the city. It
also shows Lambert and Craft beginning to achieve a more organic and potent
fusion of means, the overall structure of this new work being not only more
visually coherent, but able to harness the same uncertainties of
improvisation which blighted the group's debut production.
Michael Hulls' design - an arrangement of 20 stripped and hammered car
bonnets - and lighting - shadowy and garish by turns - creates an urban
scrapyard-cum-playground. The soundscore, by Craft, is one of those blurry
collages of filtered everyday noise - footsteps, the sirens of police cars
and fire engines, repeated fragments of conversation with street dwellers -
broken by interludes for cello and trumpet. The four performers, Cathrine
Price, Tristan Borrer, Lambert and Craft (all excellent), are not so much a
team as a collection of individuals inhabiting the same space. But a
reciprocal ebb and flow of action emerges through shared motifs: limbs
swinging into right angle hinge positions, slow push-ups, coiled jumps, the
momentary transition of body weight from feet to hands.
Like Lambert and Craft, Jeremy James and Jo Chandler seem to be trying to
forge a personalised language of dance based on an amalgam of techniques.
But while Lambert and Craft have almost ceased looking like Rambert dancers
who accidentally wandered into alien choreography and set about
reprogramming their physicality on stage, James is still working within the
parameters he knows and understands. In his own solo, Scag, he is impish,
defiant, casual, but not different enough to stop you having mental
flashbacks of his dancing in Rambert pieces such as Siobhan Davies'
Sounding.
Over the last few months, Mark Baldwin, currently choreographer in residence
at Sadler's Wells, has produced two new pieces - Factual Nonsense and More
Poulenc - the latter an affectionate companion piece to his
Poulenc-accompanied Spirit (created last year for Rambert). Along with
Island to Island, (an earlier work for Rambert), and a solo entitled Kate
Lines (for Small Axe's Cathrine Price, one of Baldwin's contemporaries at
Rambert during the 1980s), this pair of newly completed dances formed his
programme for Spring Loaded. More Poulenc, the closing number, is the
highlight of the evening. Its prankish manner, throwaway gestures and the
rich invention of its choreography become visible almost as soon as the
music, Poulenc's Les Soirees de Nazelles, commences. More Poulenc is
organised as a series of episodic sketches revolving around the events at a
house party.
As More Poulenc's mismatched characters, Sarah Warsop, Sara Matthews, Lee
Boggess and Baldwin give fine performances, letting the necessary air of
restraint waft elegantly across their encounters before succumbing to
absurdity and mischief. The sequences for Warsop, Matthews and Boggess are
fast-moving studies in elegance and dexterity, threatened by instances of
unpredictable behaviour: a limping Baldwin, coursing at dangerously high
speed towards the demurely poised trio, pausing then slumping to the ground;
Boggess, suddenly and inexplicably, bending over to let Warsop run her
fingers up and down his spine; Baldwin lifting Warsop or Matthews as though
he's tidying up the stage. Baldwin casts himself as the principal oddball, a
role in which he manages to be both mentor and fool and in which he reveals
an instinctive sense of comic timing. More Poulenc is one of the best and
strangest things he has ever made.

FT  28 MAR 94 / People: Smooth transition at Tenneco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dana Mead, Tenneco's new president and CEO, was recruited in 1991 to be
second-in-command to Mike Walsh, Tenneco's chief, he jumped at the chance to
work with an old friend on the challenge of restructuring a diversified
industrial company, writes Laurie Morse.
Barely a year later, Walsh announced he was fighting inoperable brain cancer
and Mead quickly shouldered many of the CEO's responsibilities. Last month,
51-year-old Walsh took indefinite medical leave and Mead formally took over
as Tenneco's head. Walsh remains Tenneco's chairman.
The transition was so smooth it caused barely a ripple on Wall Street, where
the silver-haired 58-year-old Mead is both well-known and respected. A West
Point graduate and former US Army colonel who served in West Germany and
Vietnam, Mead is widely expected to continue with the company's
restructuring.
In 1993 Tenneco had sales of Dollars 13.3bn and net income of Dollars 426m
or Dollars 2.44 per share. Mead is already credited with a remarkable
turnaround at Tenneco's largest division, the Wisconsin-based JI Case.
When he arrived in 1991, Case, which manufactures heavy farm and
construction machinery, logged Dollars 1bn in losses on Dollars 4bn in
sales. Last year, only a year into a three-year restructuring plan directed
by Mead, Case had operating profits of Dollars 82m.
Before coming to Tenneco, Mead spent 14 years at International Paper,
directing modernisation and expansion there. Like Walsh, Mead held an
internship at the White House, and is well-connected in Washington. He holds
a doctorate in political science and economics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

FT  28 MAR 94 / People: Ghali moves on at BankAmerica
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time during the international banking boom of the 1970s when
Bank of America seemed to use London as a testbed for its future leaders. Al
Rice, the first banker to head the the bank's London-based Europe, Middle
East and Africa (EMEA) division went on to be a vice-chairman and his
successor, Sam Armacost, became chief executive.
However, the upheavals at Bank of America and the changes in international
banking have had a knock-on effect on the importance of London in the bank's
affairs. More recently, Bank of America's top man in Europe has tended to
move on to other things outside the group when his term expired, rather than
return to San Francisco.
Paul Verburgt, a Dutchman who took over from Mont McMillen, left in 1986,
and his successor, William Young, subsequently retired from the bank and
went off to Cambridge to read modern history. Now Riad Ghali, a 48-year-old
Egyptian, is leaving next month in order to 'have time for his personal and
business pursuits in Europe'.
Ghali, who has been doing the job for three years, is handing over to Rob
Morrow, 44, who has been responsible for managing the EMEA group's wholesale
banking relationships, commercial banking and financial institutions
activities since August 1993.
Like Ghali, Morrow is one of several top executives with the same Wells
Fargo pedigree as Richard Rosenberg, chairman of BankAmerica, and chief
financial officer Lewis Coleman, tipped as Rosenberg's heir apparent.
Coleman spent ten years with Wells Fargo before joining Merrill Lynch in
1982 as executive director of its private resources operation in San
Francisco. In 1990 he joined Bank of America as managing director of mergers
and acquisitions in its capital markets division. He became executive vice
president and manager of its US division corporate banking group a year
later.

FT  28 MAR 94 / People: New challenge for Vance the peacemaker at Macy's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cyrus Vance, the unflappable US diplomat who tried and failed to bring peace
to Bosnia, has taken on his fair share of thankless tasks since serving as
US secretary of state under Jimmy Carter, writes Frank McGurty. His latest
leap of faith - as court-appointed mediator in the negotiations to bring the
Macy's department store chain out of bankruptcy - is likely to test his
patience to the limit.
Vance, who celebrated his 77th birthday yesterday, is charged with hammering
out a reorganisation plan that will satisfy a panoply of competing
creditors, owed a total of Dollars 6bn by the once-proud New York retailing
group.
After dragging on for more than two years, the process took on a sense of
urgency three months ago when Federated Department Stores, a long-time rival
and owner of New York's Bloomingdales, bought a big chunk of Macy's debt to
use as leverage in forcing a merger between the two groups.
Last week the battle entered a critical phase, with Macy's management
submitting to Vance its blueprint for keeping the group independent. The
plan, which is really just a starting point for negotiations, appears to
have placated a disgruntled group of junk bondholders, but it managed to
upset secured creditors who had supported an earlier version of the plan.
The escalation of tensions raises the likelihood of Federated succeeding in
its ambitions.
Vance, who works for the law firm of Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett, is
scheduled to meet Macy's creditors, including Federated, on April 11. If he
hopes to broker a deal among them, Vance will be sure to need all the
diplomatic skills he refined on his last international mission.

FT  28 MAR 94 / The Monday Interview: No short cuts for committed minimalist
 -Fame has come late for fashion designer Jil Sander, explains Alice
Rawsthorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most fashion designers hit the headlines when they are bright young things
turning out avant garde designs at the start of their careers; but there are
exceptions for whom fame and acclaim comes later in life.
Jil Sander, now 50, has for two decades been creating contemporary classic
clothes in a subtle, understated style. Her crisply-cut trouser suits and
tunics have won her a fanatical following among the nattier brand of
bus-inesswomen and Hollywood sirens such as Winona Ryder and Sharon Stone.
Her commercial success has already made her one of the wealthiest women in
her native Germany. But it is only recently, as consumer taste has swung
away from the opulence of the 1980s, that Jil Sander's minimalism has been
billed the look of the moment.
'It feels like my time has come,' she says. 'I felt out of step with fashion
in the 1980s. I hated the madame look - all those little suits with shiny
buttons. It was boring and bourgeois. It made women look like little girls.
I like clothes that make them look cool and classy - that bring out their
strength. Women don't have to dress like bimbos to be sexy.'
Sander, with her tousled blonde bob and laughing blue eyes, is typical of
the strong, self-confident women for whom she designs. She exudes energy as
she strides into the room in a navy blue trouser suit and immaculate white
T-shirt. Her face is free from make-up. Her only ornament is an extremely
expensive, but workmanlike, watch.
She was born Heidemarie Jiline Sander in wartime Wesselburen, a small town
on the North Sea coast to which her mother had fled from the Hamburg bombs
while her father was fighting on the Russian front. Her childhood was happy
and comfortable, but there was nothing in it that might have been expected
to spur her on to her current success.
'There were no career women in my family, so I didn't have any role models
in that sense. But my mother was very creative and she always encouraged me
to express myself. The German women of her generation were very strong. Life
was tough in the years after the second world war. Many women played dual
roles by looking after their families and earning a living. That made a big
impression on their children, like me, and even on their grandchildren.'
Sander studied textile engineering and then spent a year as an exchange
student in Los Angeles. 'It was a wonderful time for me. California seemed
so sunny and free after Germany which, in the early 1960s, was still
stifling and narrow-minded.' But she cut short her stay in the US when her
father died and returned home to help her mother and younger brother.
She worked as a stylist on a fashion magazine and started to design clothes
in her spare time. In 1968 she opened a boutique in the plush Poseldorf area
of Hamburg and in 1974 launched her first full collection. Germany then, as
now, had a huge commercial clothing industry. But it was a creative
back-water. Karl Lagerfeld, the only other notable German designer of her
generation, fled to France where he is now artistic director of Chanel.
Sander stayed in Hamburg to go it alone.
'It wasn't easy establishing myself as a designer in Germany,' she says now.
'The struggle of rebuilding the country after the war and the guilt about
the terrible things that had happened created a very materialistic culture.
The nouveaux riches were very powerful and the creative part of our heritage
tended to be forgotten. Things are changing now after reunification, but in
those days it was difficult.'
Also she began her business at a time when it was relatively rare for women
to do so. 'It may sound surprising but I've never experienced any problems
because of my sex. I founded the company and I run it myself. That's the way
it's always been. I've never had a boss. Things might have been different if
I had. I think some men do find it difficult to deal with women in positions
of authority. That's why so many women set up on their own. They opt out of
the boardroom battles.'
The business grew gradually in the early years but its expansion has
accelerated since going public in 1989. Sander is now the chairman and
majority shareholder of a company with annual turnover of Dollars 210m that
sells everything from Pounds 900 suits to Pounds 30 bottles of scent.
Yet she still sees herself as a designer rather than a businesswoman. 'Even
as a child I always knew I wanted to be creative, but the business side came
as a surprise. I do it because I have to. It still amazes me that I have a
flair for it. The key is delegation. I've made sure that I have very good
people.'
She still oversees every aspect of the design of her collections and even
tries on each garment to check the cut and construction. 'I need to know
whether anything is wrong. The only way to be sure is to try it myself.'
What sort of mistakes does she find? 'Everything.' Her face wrinkles. 'Maybe
the sleeves are too short or a button is in the wrong place. I've got to be
sure.'
She usually works for 14 hours a day. 'I've always been pre-occupied by my
career. There's never been enough time for me to play a conventional
domestic role, even if I'd wanted to.' But she does enjoy the fruits of her
success - she has a 19th century town house in Hamburg, a country estate in
Schleswig-Holstein and the latest acquisition, an 18th century town house in
Paris.
At first she favoured the same minimalist style for her homes as for her
clothes. 'It was very chic,' she laughs. 'So chic that no one could relax.'
These days she scours the auction rooms for antique furniture, although her
taste in art is still uncompromisingly contemporary. 'I'm a modernist. I'm
interested in art that reflects my own era. Besides, I've been buying work
by Joseph Beuys, Jannis Kounellis and Cy Twombly since the early days when
it was cheap. It certainly (giggle) isn't now.'
Her latest passion is gardening. She has created a formal English garden in
the grounds of her Schleswig-Holstein estate and spends her spare time there
pruning trees and clipping hedges. 'I love the idea of planning a garden and
imagining how it will look in 10 or 20 years. It's a wonderful contrast to
fashion. Clothes come and go from season to season. It's all change, change,
change. A garden is something that lasts.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / Management: Tests on trial - Psychometric testing of job
candidates is objective - True or False?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All great paintings require an act of creativity. All paintings are painted
by artists. Therefore all artists are creative. True or false?'.
An uncontroversial question, you might think. Yet a psychometric test
containing 80 similar questions was last week criticised on the grounds of
racial bias. Used by the General Council of the Bar of England and Wales to
help select students for the barristers' finals course, the test is being
blamed for a success rate of nearly 50 per cent for white candidates
compared to less than 20 per cent for black and ethnic minority candidates.
'Nothing terrible has happened,' says Robert Wood of Pearn Kandola
Occupational Psychologists who helped design the selection system. He says
the test was properly applied, and points out that the number of successful
black candidates was higher than in previous years. Nevertheless, the
Council of Legal Education feels obliged to mount an investigation. 'Clearly
there have been disparities in the selection rates. We need to look at what
may have caused them,' says John Taylor, secretary of the CLE.
The allegation of bias in psychometric testing is a serious one. Some 80 per
cent of British companies use psychometric tests, and the number is rising.
Employers use them to test for abilities as well as for personality traits.
They use them to decide who to hire, who to promote, and even who to fire.
An estimated 100,000 tests are used in the UK each year for selection alone.
Some come from reputable firms which design the tests with great care.
Others are supplied by 'bucket shops', or even come free with general
packages of computer software.
Employers like psychometric tests because they appear to be more objective
than other ways of assessing people. Interviews often prove to be of little
use in picking the right person, and are wide open to discrimination. But
while there is evidence that aptitude tests at least can be good predictors
of success in the job, they can be dangerous in the wrong hands.
'Psychometric testing is not a neutral tool, and must be used carefully,'
says Chris Myant from the Commission for Racial Equality. He argues that
nearly all tests are culturally loaded: different racial groups have had
different educations, make different assumptions and may think differently,
affecting their performance accordingly.
In the US psychometric tests fell out of fashion a decade ago on the racial
discrimination issue. They are now making a come-back, but only in cases
where they have been proved to be both relevant and equally valid for
different ethnic groups.
In Britain the CRE recommends that all tests should have been tried out on a
racially mixed group to identify bias, and that the standard of skills set
in the test should be appropriate to the job in question.
When eight Asian guards wanting to become British Rail drivers recently
failed a verbal reasoning test, the CRE complained. It said verbal reasoning
was not necessary for train drivers, and that the test was therefore
discriminatory. BR subsequently changed the test, and some of the guards who
initially failed are now drivers.
However, even when obvious cultural references have been stripped out and
the level of test is appropriate for the job in hand, tests can still favour
one race or sex above another. Charles Johnson, an occupational psychologist
at Psychometric Research &amp; Development who advised the Bar Council, argues
that bias can creep in subtly. For instance, there is some evidence that
ethnic minorities and women are less prepared to guess the right answer,
which penalises them in tests where no marks are taken off for wrong
replies. Moreover, people who have been brought up on a heavy diet of exams
will be better at controlling the speed at which they are working, and
therefore tend to score higher.
In spite of these problems Johnson argues that the tests can still be useful
if not too much reliance is placed on any one test and the pass mark is not
set too high.
One problem is the variable quality of suppliers. Saville &amp; Holds-worth, one
of the largest in Britain, researches each test on different ethnic groups
before selling it. If it finds that certain groups score differently it
makes sure that all users are aware of the discrepancy.
Moreover, reliable firms do not sell tests to anyone who has not been
trained in how to use them. 'Some instruments are knocked up over a wet
weekend in someone's front room and then given some energetic marketing,'
warns Donald McLeod, a psychologist at Ashridge Management College.
Part of the danger in psychometric tests lies in their very promise of
objectivity. 'People think if it's scientific, it must be fair,' says Angela
Baron, a policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel Management. 'Unless
you understand how they work and what you are measuring they are open to
discrimination.'
The IPM recently published lengthy guidelines for companies using
psychometric tests, starting with the golden rule that the tests would only
be a part of a selection process, and indicating the importance of training
and the need for careful monitoring.
While ability tests are controversial, personality tests are even more
contentious. The latter variety of psychometric test has recently become the
most popular of all. The tests ask a series of questions, ranging from 'Do
you prefer baths to showers?' to 'Do you consider yourself to be outgoing?',
in order to assess up to 30 different personality traits. Companies feel
they are getting more precise information than can be obtained otherwise, in
a form that allows them to compare candidates objectively.
Baron argues that employers should take care when using this sort of
information in recruitment, although it could be useful in career
counselling. 'You need to ask if personality is relevant to the job anyway.
Often it isn't,' she says.
Personality tests can be distorted by the mood of the candidate on the day,
or by fake answers. More alarmingly, there is little conclusive evidence
that personality test results are related to performance in the job.
Academics such as Johnson, who believe in carefully monitored aptitude
testing, draw the line at personality tests. 'The idea that you can get
paper and pencil tests to measure something intangible - I don't believe
it,' he says.
At least one thing can be said for them: as there are no right or wrong
answers, the question of racial bias is not so serious. Yet that is not much
consolation if they are not worth a row of beans anyway.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Management: Remedies for absenteeism - Ways to cut one of UK
business's biggest blights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the middle of this week the full burden of sick pay will fall on most
big UK employers for the first time. The government claims that the
reduction in National Insurance contributions will compensate for the
overall cost - estimated at Pounds 700m - but within this there will be
winners and losers.
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said when he announced the
changes that his intention was to encourage employers to work harder at
controlling absenteeism. According to the Confederation of British Industry
there remains plenty of scope for improvement.
A CBI report carried out with Percom, a UK consultancy, last year suggested
that absenteeism was one of the biggest blights on UK business, costing
employers Pounds 13bn a year.
Absence rates on average are running at about 4 to 5 per cent, according to
most estimates, but managers are beginning to recognise that lower levels
can be achieved. Some argue that often it is simply a matter of caring about
people who work for you.
Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), the Sunderland-based car manufacturer,
records absence figures of around 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, less than five
days an employee per year, in an industry that has been notorious for
absenteeism.
Peter Wickens, Nissan's personnel director says the plant's current absence
levels are 1.8 per cent. He says: 'I always regard absence as having very
little to do with sickness and a hell of a lot to do with lack of
motivation.' Nissan pays everyone from day one of sickness.
'I think that people who are paid when off sick are less likely to be sick,'
says Wickens, who argues that a system where people are not paid when they
are off encourages employees to believe that no one loses when they are
away.
The company's sick pay agreement includes a penalty. If people abuse the
system they are liable to be disqualified from sickness benefit or face
disciplinary action. Workers are expected to telephone when they are sick
and are asked about their sickness when they return.
Andrew Sargent, managing director of Sargent Minton, employee relations
consultants, says five days absence a year is sufficient to take care of
most minor illnesses such as flu epidemics. 'The big problem is that grey
area between those who are genuinely sick and people who are genuinely
malingering. There are always people who will take companies for a ride,' he
says.
Leadswingers (skivers), he says, have become more accomplished at spreading
their absences across the year. The answer is to treat absenteeism as a
management problem. 'This will mean better record keeping, better
communication and more attentive and enthusiastic acceptance that ultimately
only management can provide the cure,' he says.
Both the CBI and an earlier Industrial Society survey suggest that full-time
manual workers lose on average twice as many days as full-time non-manual
workers. The CBI calculated that eight days a year per employee were being
lost in manufacturing, but this was topped by local government and National
Health Service employees with 10 and 11 days lost respectively.
The approach of Lewisham Borough Council is typical of the way the public
sector is beginning to tackle the problem.
Andreas Ghosh, the council's assistant chief personnel officer, says absence
levels were 17 days a year for each employee when the authority embarked on
an initiative to bring absence levels down two years ago. Today, absenteeism
has fallen by 5.8 days a year, equivalent to Pounds 1.5m of services.
Managers were trained to monitor absence using computer programmes which
trigger on-screen messages when individuals reach certain absence rates.
While effective monitoring can can reduce absenteeism to 2 per cent a year,
according to some estimates, tackling absence in a piecemeal way is unlikely
to get the sort of results achieved by Nissan. That, argues Wickens, results
from the overall management approach to production, teamworking and
motivation.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Management: S Africa's black managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political change in South Africa has accelerated the need to develop more
black managers in public and private sectors alike. But blacks are still
poorly represented - particularly at senior levels in organisations - and
the challenge is formidable.
One attempt to redress the balance is today's conference in Oxford run by
the Southern African Advanced Education Project, an independent charity
which provides advance training and work experience to help South Africans
build leadership and management skills. The event brings together about 160
black South African graduates and representatives of big employers including
Total South Africa, South African Breweries, South African Post-Office,
Unilever, Standard Bank and the power company Eskom.
The idea is part recruitment drive, part seminar. According to Patrick
Wintour of SAAEP, roughly half of those who attended the last two
conferences either directly or indirectly landed their first job as a
result. 'The sense of urgency among employers to recruit good black
graduates is now much greater,' says Wintour, though he adds that SAAEP has
been 'less than successful' in tapping the interest of UK companies with
South African subsidiaries.
Wintour says affirmative action remains a hot issue in the private sector,
but believes the focus of debate may shift as the new government attempts to
change the complexion of the public sector without unduly increasing its
size.
He identifies three main lessons learnt so far. First, companies should give
black recruits real jobs: 'Tokenism has been exposed for the fraud that it
is.' Second, employers should be prepared to take risks 'even if they are
not 100 per cent sure that someone is right for the next move'. Third, they
should 'tell other employees what they are doing and why they are doing it,
so that everyone does not get confused'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Business Travel: False start at the stop - Daniel Green has
reservations about the Heathrow bus service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Catching the bus into central London from Heathrow airport might seem like a
good idea. A taxi costs at least Pounds 30, while, by the Underground, the
journey takes up to an hour - or more if you need to change at stations
where platforms are several minutes' walk apart, such as Green Park.
Moreover, the only view from the Tube is either of London's western suburbs
or the inside of a tunnel. And stations still have too many staircases for
travellers with heavy cases.
The Airbus, on the other hand, which is run by London Buses, offers a choice
of routes going directly past the capital's main hotels. It does not stop in
the suburbs, so travelling times compare favourably with the Tube's. Perhaps
best of all, there are splendid views from the upper deck of what is
essentially a converted London bus. The ticket costs Pounds 5 single, Pounds
8 return.
This sounds ideal for the business executive on a budget. But when I tried
it last month, on returning from a trip to Paris, I found that this was not
the case.
The pick-up points at Heathrow are fairly easy to find, especially at
Terminal Four. Each of the two services - one to Victoria bus station, the
other to Russell Square - is scheduled to leave every 20 minutes or half
hour, depending on the time of day, so it is worth checking the timetable to
avoid a long wait.
On the day I was travelling, however, the timetable proved irrelevant. A
businessman, two Japanese women and I waited at the Terminal Four stop until
10 minutes after the scheduled departure time. I approached a man with
'Airbus' emblazoned on his jacket. He replied: 'I don't know, mate. I
started here two days ago.'
Further pressure eventually persuaded him into a booth with darkened windows
and, apparently, a telephone inside. He emerged with the comment: 'The
bus'll be here in about 10 minutes.' It was not.
After a struggle to get him back into the box, he said: 'It'll be here at 25
to the hour.' This was the next timetabled slot. That time passed, however,
and still nothing happened.
One hour after we had arrived at the bus stop, the four of us decided to
take the Underground.
London Buses insists that the Airbus service has had a reliable 14 years in
service and gets 'very few complaints'. It concedes that it should find a
way to inform waiting passengers of delays.
Until it does so, business passengers, especially those with appointments,
should not take the Airbus. And if you are travelling from central London to
the airport and need to make your check-in time, consider buying a good
newspaper and travelling by Tube.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Business Travel: How five Bs drive a harder bargain - The
way European companies use travel agents is changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Lovell, head of Wagonlit Travel in northern Europe, remembers the
conversations he used to have with potential clients six years ago. 'They'd
say: 'You're a pretty good agency, you've got a good reputation, another
percentage point off your quote will get you the business,' ' he recalls.
Today, Mr Lovell says, business travel agencies bidding for new contracts
are routinely asked to submit proposals more than 100 pages long.
Mr Bill Kirkwood, travel management sales and marketing director at Thomas
Cook, says his company recently concluded a contract with the Swiss Bank
Corporation. The negotiations lasted three months. Five years ago, he says,
they would have taken 10 days.
Travel agents say European companies are radically changing the way they
manage business travel. Mr Lovell says the revolution began in the UK - for
two reasons.
The first was that the recession and the drive for cost-cutting struck
Britain before it affected the rest of Europe. The second was that trends
from the US, where hard-nosed travel purchasing is well-established, usually
take root in the UK more quickly than elsewhere in Europe. The same trends
are now appearing in other European countries too.
The first thing travel agents noticed was that they were negotiating with
different people. They used to deal with a company's travel manager.
Increasingly, they found themselves being interviewed by the head of
procurement: the person buying airline tickets and hotel rooms tended to be
the same manager who purchased the company's electricity and cars, says Mr
Lovell.
Mr Kirkwood says that, in some companies, the finance director or the head
of human resources began to negotiate travel contracts. Travel managers have
not disappeared from all companies, he says. Where they survive, however,
they usually work more closely with senior directors.
Mr Lovell says a new feature of the UK market is the appearance of travel
consultants, who help companies negotiate their contracts. Frequently, the
consultants are travel managers who have been made redundant. Still a rare
breed in the UK, travel consultants are common in the US, he says.
The information companies require from travel agents has changed too. In
their 100-page documents, travel agents are expected to describe the
structure of their own company - who owns it and what its financial
strengths are. Companies want to know where travel agents have their
branches and whether these are conveniently located for the client's own
offices and factories.
Travel agents are asked to provide some sample quotes on airlines and
hotels. They are asked to say who their other clients are. Mr Kirkwood says
companies prefer travel agents to have clients of a similar size and status
to themselves, so that they can establish performance and expenditure
benchmarks.
Travel agents are required to provide references from other clients. They
are also asked to provide details about their own staff, often from the
chief executive downwards. Mr Lovell says companies sometimes ask if travel
agents can help staff with their leisure travel.
How does this compare with a few years ago? 'A few years ago, you'd exchange
a few letters,' Mr Lovell says.
Mr Kirkwood says that while companies demand constant reductions in the cost
of their business travel, they have begun to realise they cannot continually
ask agents to pass on a growing part of their commissions to customers.
Instead, increasingly they offer agents a proportion of the savings they
make.
He says: 'The typical commission on a Pounds 100 airline ticket is Pounds 9.
Instead of asking for more of that commission, they're saying: 'Reduce the
Pounds 91.' '
Mr Kirkwood says travel agents have to develop strategies to ensure they can
communicate with all relevant staff on the client's premises and not just
those at the top.
Thomas Cook calls the most important employees 'the five Bs': the buyer of
travel, who makes the principal decisions; the booker, who makes travel
arrangements; the business traveller; the budget-holder, who controls the
traveller's expenditure; and the back-office staff, who make the payments.
He says he expects corporate travel policy to evolve further in the next few
years. Airline deregulation means there are far too many special deals on
offer for companies to keep track of them all. Hotels will go the same way,
Mr Kirkwood believes: instead of having just an official rate and a
corporate discount, hotels are increasingly quoting a range of prices aimed
at ensuring they make the best use of their rooms.
Instead of companies specifying which class staff must fly and which carrier
and type of hotel they should use, he believes they will tell employees they
can spend a certain sum on each trip. It will then be up to the staff to
sort out the most convenient route and hotel with the company's travel
agent.

France has urged its nationals to return home from Algeria, unless their

FT  28 MAR 94 / Ministers to back bill on leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is set to back a Conservative MP's bill to change the law of
privity of contract in England and Wales in a move which could mean that
reforms to commercial leases are enacted as early as this summer.
The bill - being prepared by Mr Peter Thurnham, Tory MP for Bolton North
East - would abolish the convention, peculiar to England and Wales, by which
an original tenant in a commercial property lease is liable to pay the rent
if a subsequent tenant defaults.
The Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday that the government would
support any private member's bill that was close to its own proposals.
Mr Thurnham said he was confident that his bill - which would be drafted
'very shortly' - would receive 'very strong backing from all sides of the
House of Commons'.
It has long been the government's intention to reform this aspect of the law
but ministers have been unable to find the parliamentary time needed for a
bill to be enacted.
Business leaders have been prominent among those calling for change. Earlier
this month Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry, cited a bill reforming privity of contract as an example
of the type of legislation - helpful to the business community - that he
would like to see ministers accommodate in the parliamentary timetable.
Parliamentary procedures make it far from certain that Mr Thurnham's bill
will reach the statute book even if it is backed by ministers. Private
member's bills can be blocked by the opposition of one MP.
Opposition is expected to the change on the grounds that limiting a tenant's
responsibility for paying rent throughout a lease is likely to reduce the
security of a building's income and so the value of a landlord's investment.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Courtaulds plans Pounds 80m plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Courtaulds, the chemicals and textiles group, is expected to
approve in the next few days the spending of about Pounds 80m on a European
plant to produce Tencel, its new synthetic fabric.
The plant is to be sited either at Grimsby on Humberside or near Munich in
Germany.
The approval is expected almost to coincide with a long-delayed agreement by
Courtaulds and Hoechst, the German chemicals company, to merge their
European viscose and acrylic fibres operations under Courtaulds' control.
Courtaulds said yesterday it hoped that the merger, first announced in May
last year but delayed by competition-authority scrutiny, would be signed
before the end of this week. A decision on where to locate the Tencel plant
will follow soon.
Courtaulds wants the plant running in 1996 to cater for what it says will be
surging world demand for the material, which is made from wood pulp and said
to combine the toughness of denim with the feel of silk.
Courtaulds is supplying Tencel to all main markets, including Europe, from
an 18,000 tonnes-a-year facility in Alabama, where a second plant to
increase capacity to more than 40,000 tonnes a year is due to be operating
soon.
The European plant will increase capacity to well over 50,000 tonnes a year
and supply some Far East markets as well as those in Europe.
Because the production processes for Tencel are highly automated, employment
at such a facility is likely to be measured in dozens rather than hundreds.
The company said yesterday that the rival advantages of Grimsby and Munich
had still to be fully weighed.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Farm wages board set for government reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government looks likely to bow to pressure from farm workers and their
employers by preserving the Agricultural Wages Board, which lays down
minimum wage rates for 180,000 farmworkers.
An announcement confirming the board's future is expected this week from Mrs
Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister.
Last week, after the board awarded a 4.9 per cent wage rise to farm workers,
Mrs Shephard said she had been indundated with calls from all parts of the
industry for its preservation.
Last week's decision by the board came in spite of opposition from the
National Farmers Union, although many farmers prefer the existing system
because it ensures stability.
The government last year scrapped the wages councils that laid down minimum
levels of pay for an estimated 4.5m workers in low-wage sectors such as
hotels and catering. Ministers appear to accept, however, that farm workers
still need wage protection.
A decision to retain the Agricultural Wages Board would be a relief to the
Trades Union Congress, which has pressed for a reprieve, saying that
abolition would lead to downward pressure on wages, create more unemployment
in the countryside and result in lower investment.
The TUC, in its written submission to the government, pointed out such a
move would mean breaching the UK's obligations under the European Union's
treaty of Rome, which states that the Common Agricultural Policy should
ensure a fair standard of living for the farming community.
The TUC also wants to increase the board's staffing to ensure more vigorous
enforcement of pay awards, and favours protection for farmworkers who make
complaints to the board about their pay.

The finest collection of early printed books to be sold at auction for more

Pounds 3m. The books come from the court library of Prince Joachim zu
Furstenberg, and some were bought by the family direct from the printers.
Many are in their original bindings. Books from 52 towns and more than 160
presses are represented. Rarities include an almanac of 1462 believed to be
the first example of printing from Vienna and a first edition of the
'Speculum humanae salvationis' with the text in Latin and in German 'for
nuns and other religious persons who do not understand Latin'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Marshall acquires Bedford marque from GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marshall, the Cambridgeshire-based vehicle and aerospace group, has struck a
deal with General Motors under which it has acquired world marketing rights
to the Bedford commercial vehicle name and bought the entire Bedford truck
and bus parts business.
The deal is expected to lead to a substantial increase in Marshall's truck
production this year, from 400 to about 600.
Executives of Marshall SPV, the umbrella company for Marshall's vehicle
operations, regard the acquisition of the parts business as at least as
important because of the large number of Bedford vehicles on the world's
roads.
Mr Dick Revell, Marshall SPV's parts director, said at the weekend: 'On a
conservative estimate there are at least 500,000 out there.' Bedford, which
has a 60-year history, was once the world's largest truckmaker. GM sold the
Bedford truckmaking business for Pounds 22m in 1987, when it was losing
Pounds 500,000 a week, to the entrepreneur Mr David Brown, who renamed it
AWD. At one time under Mr Brown's ownership AWD was employing more than
1,300 people and making more than 5,000 trucks a year.
After the business went into receivership in June 1992 Marshall bought from
the receivers AWD's product designs, order book, rights to the AWD name and
limited rights to the Bedford name.
Marshall executives believe that a significant reason for AWD's failure was
that its own deal with GM did not include the consistently profitable parts
business. Most truckmakers earn most of their revenue from replacement parts
rather than new vehicle sales.
Neither Vauxhall Motors, GM's UK subsidiary which is the formal signatory to
the deal, nor Marshall - a reticent company which prefers to conduct its
affairs out of the public spotlight - would give any financial details of
the agreement.
One measure of the size of the parts business, however, is that Marshall has
already shipped 170 articulated truckloads of parts to warehouses and
distribution sites in Kent from the former Bedford factory at Dunstable,
Bedfordshire.
Marshall SPV was originally set up as Marshall of Cambridge (Engineering) to
make vehicle bodies and exploit the international market for specialist
military vehicles such as field ambulances. It changed its name two years
ago and has extended its activities in the civilian vehicles field. Its
range includes refuse disposal vehicles, single-decker buses and car
transporters and trailers. It also owns Carlisle, the Birmingham-based
busmaker. Mr Bob Crosby, the UK sales manager, said the company had no
intention of re-entering the mainstream commercial market for trucks.
Marshall has been awarded exclusive rights to the Bedford name and trademark
throughout Europe. Its rights outside Europe are non-exclusive, although
GM's own use of the Bedford name - confined to a few developing world
markets - relates only to light vehicles such as Isuzu-built pick-ups.

TRW, the US motor, space and defence multinational, is to set up its fourth
motor components plant near Nissan's Sunderland car factory, creating 160
jobs.
TRW is investing Pounds 8m in the plant at Houghton-le-Spring, Wearside. It
will produce electronic trigger mechanisms for safety air bags, one of the
fastest-growing sectors of the motor components industry.
TRW's three existing plants in the area make switches, engine valves and
seat-belt systems - not exclusively for Nissan.
The air-bag mechanism will be exported throughout Europe. Recruitment is to
start early in the summer, with the plant expected on stream by the end of
the year.
The new facility is the latest in a series of motor component manufacturing
investments in the north, and lifts to about 30 the number of such companies
located close to the Nissan plant. When Nissan started production in 1986
only three suppliers were located in the north-east.
Nissan, which employs about 5,000 people at the Sunderland site, says it has
generated about 3,000 jobs at component suppliers based either on its car
factory site or in the north-east.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Water consumer surveys questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water companies have been warned not to rely on surveys of the public's
willingness to pay for higher water quality.
Mr George Gaskell, of the London School of Economics, said surveys of
whether households would pay for enhanced quality could be unreliable.
A particular target of his criticism, made in an LSE research paper, is a
1992 survey conducted for Ofwat by MORI, the market research company. Mr
Gaskell says that the findings - which showed concern about rising water
bills as well as about pollution - are not reliable because water is a
highly political and subjective issue, where people are not well-informed
about the technical details.
His criticism comes just days before the water companies of England and
Wales submit their strategic business plans to Ofwat, the water industry
regulator. The proposed investment plans, which cover the next 20 years,
have been based partly on detailed customer surveys conducted last summer.
Mr Gaskell, LSE head of social psychology, says: 'Until consumers are more
informed it is probably inappropriate to use responses in opinion surveys as
the basis for the development of services.'
According to water industry estimates investment by the industry in
long-overdue modernisation and in meeting new environmental standards could
reach Pounds 40bn this decade. Ofwat, which is concerned that water bills
will have to keep rising much faster than inflation to pay for this
spending, has asked the companies to examine whether some discretionary
improvements - such as those to taste, colour and flood defences - are
really wanted by customers.
Ofwat, whose executives say they are 'braced for pantechnicons on paper'
from the companies on Thursday, will tell the companies in May how fast it
will allow their prices to rise between 1995 and 2005.
Mr Peter Hutton, the MORI director responsible for the 1992 Ofwat study,
said MORI had conducted 14 surveys for individual companies since the 1992
survey, and found nothing to contradict its findings.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Redwood to hit at 'unnecessary' green regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rightwing cabinet minister will today launch an assault on unnecessary
environmental regulations.
In a fresh indication of how economic hardship has pushed 'green' issues
down the political agenda, Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, will
announce a review to assess whether all protected areas in the principality
need to be so protected.
In his address to Tory activists in Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, Mr Redwood
will also touch on subsidiarity by arguing that planning decisions should be
left wherever possible to local councillors.
It should be up to councillors to decide whether to give priority to jobs or
wildlife, he will say. 'We are not in the business of frustrating people who
want new jobs and new homes.'
In remarks which will do little to further the efforts of Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, to build a 'green' image for the government, Mr
Redwood will argue that environmentalism in Wales has tended to develop in a
'random' way. He will say the Welsh Office's efforts to encourage prosperity
are often blocked by environmental regulations from London or Brussels.
In his efforts to restore a higher-profile government approach to
environmental issues, Mr Gummer recently attacked the encroachment of 'urban
sprawl' on the countryside and the construction of shopping malls outside
towns.
Last month he called for tighter protection for green belts - areas where
development is curbed in order to prevent growing towns from joining
together.
Last November a report from the Government Statistical Service cast doubt on
the success of the government initiative to regenerate the south Wales
valleys, saying manufacturing jobs created had been more than offset by job
losses.
This prompted Mr Redwood to make a strong defence of the initiative, saying
it was important to persuade new investors that 'this was a beautiful part
of Wales with a future, and not just a scarred piece of Wales with a past
that had gone wrong'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Managers at BR warn on contracts: Threat to renegotiate
after sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail managers, who are negotiating contracts with other parts of the
organisation in preparation for privatisation, say that they will not feel
bound by the deals should they later succeed in management buy-outs of BR
operations.
BR's train operating divisions are negotiating access contracts with
Railtrack, the state-owned company which will own the track and signalling
after privatisation.
The contract negotiations are taking place under the guidance of Mr Roger
Salmon, the rail franchising director. The train operators say that the
contracts are not being drawn up realistically. Mr Salmon has to arrange a
smooth sale of BR's operations to private-sector franchises.
The train operating companies will continue as BR divisions for several
months but will be incorporated as BR subsidiaries later this year and
expect to gain independence as private companies from next year.
Senior managers forecast that negotiations to modify the contracts can be
expected at the stage of incorporation and then of private sale. This call
for renegotiation reflects the tension between the train operators and
Railtrack, which has been accused of taking unfair advantage of its monopoly
ownership of BR's infrastructure.
One manager said: 'The franchising director should not think that the train
operating companies will simply buy a pile of contracts.'
The office of the franchising director responded that it accepted that some
renegotiation might be necessary but it did not expect its work to be
totally overturned. It said: 'We are pre-negotiating these contracts with an
eye to when these activities are sold as franchises.'
The franchising director expects 'quite robust negotiations' when the train
operators have established their own sets of accounts. This makes it crucial
for him to find other bidders for BR's operations so that management buy-out
teams are not left as the sole bidders able to dictate terms.
Privatisation critics say the network of contracts needed between the
different companies that will provide rail services will create red tape.
The government says such contracts are normal in sectors such as the airline
industry.
In a separate move the seven passenger transport authorities, responsible
for commuter railways in the main conurbations, said they could not maintain
services unless the government made a long-term commitment to public
subsidy. The authorities' track charges are to increase from Pounds 78m to
Pounds 222m next year. A meeting is to be held tomorrow with Mr Roger
Freeman, transport minister.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Roadbuilding programme set for small cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the long-awaited review of Britain's Pounds 23bn roads
programme, due to be announced on Wednesday, is expected to show a trimming
of roadbuilding schemes rather than deep cuts.
Most motorway-widening schemes are set to stay largely intact in spite of
fierce protests from lobbyists and backbench Tory MPs.
The overall reduction in planned roadbuilding activity may be no more than
10 per cent or 15 per cent. This is unlikely to ease pressure on the
department from MPs of all parties and from other government departments.
Transport 2000, a pressure group, said: 'It is likely to intensify rather
than quell concerns about the roads programme.'
Road priorities have been under review since last August, when it became
clear that the 10-year Roads for Prosperity programme, launched in 1989, was
falling well behind schedule. The aim is to reduce planning blight - the
adverse impact on property prices from roadbuilding announcements - and to
allow the department to speed up work on the most realistic schemes.
The present programme involves nearly 500 projects, including the widening
of 600 miles of motorway, expanding single-carriageway trunk roads to dual
carriageway and building more than 150 bypasses. It also includes upgrades
of the A1 and A74 to motorway standard.
The review has taken traffic forecasts into account. It is expected to
confirm existing government policy to improve existing roads rather than to
build new ones and to avoidupgrading radial routes in large cities.
There is not expected to be any radical change in the environmental criteria
applied to road schemes.
The British Roads Federation said it expected the government to go ahead
with motorway widening plans because of their economic importance. It said:
'We don't expect the motorway network to grow much over the next 100 years
so the roads we have must have a high capacity.'
The RAC said it did not expect large cuts in the roads programme but it was
concerned that some bypass schemes might be dropped.
Publication of the roads review is expected to coincide with the launch of
the government's Highways Agency. This will take over responsibility for the
road building and maintenance programme to speed up schemes and reduce
costs.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Government criticises EC social policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has criticised the European Commission's green paper on
social policy.  It said many of the themes should be left to member states.
The government attacked the green paper for suggesting that 'levels of
social provision and regulation can only ever increase' and for supporting
'merchanistic approaches to labour market intervention'.
The government wants discussion on how far EU social policy impedes UK
competitiveness and how far it protects member states with high levels of
social protection.
The paper could form the basis of a new programme of social legislation.

FT  28 MAR 94 / IoD slams CBI on works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Directors has criticised its rival employers' body, the
Confederation of British Industry, for accepting the principle of a
trans-national European works council for talks with employees.
The issue of works councils, which has been a subject of intense debate for
20 years, comes to a head tomorrow when negotiations on the subject between
Unice, the European employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress
are set to break down.
A breakdown will make it almost certain that the European Commission will
pass a directive on the issue early next year.
Although Britain's Maastricht treaty social 'opt-out' means UK companies
will not be hit in the UK, 70 or 80 British multinationals will be effected
in continental Europe and are unlikely to exclude their UK employees.
The IoD is still, however, furious with the CBI, the largest single member
of Unice, for conceding in negotiations that 'minimum requirements' can be
enforced in the event of companies and employees failing to reach agreement.
European employers have accepted the goal of consultation but insisted that
there should be flexibility about how it is delivered. Mr Peter Morgan,
director-general of the IoD, believes, however, that the wording of the
latest Unice-ETUC agreement amounts to an 'own goal' in accepting a works
council-type forum.
Mr Morgan said: 'We urge the CBI and other national employer organisations
in the member states of the EU to rethink their position on Unice's
negotiations with the ETUC and to oppose proposals which would require
companies to set up union-dominated works councils.'
The IoD believes that even if the ETUC rejects the Unice position next week
 -because of disagreements about the level in the company at which the works
council should operate - European companies will find it more difficult to
argue against the idea.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Retail spending surge predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail spending will rise 12.1 per cent in real terms in the next five years
compared with 4.8 per cent between 1988 and 1993, says Verdict, the retail
research group.
It says demand will still be weak although spending growth will be faster.
That means inflation is unlikely to exceed 3 per cent.
Verdict says that significant demographic changes will be important for
retailers and consumer goods producers. Older consumers with low housing
costs in relation to their incomes will rise in number and will have more
disposable income.
Verdict says the number of consumers aged 30 to 40 will rise by almost
800,000, boosting sales of household goods, DIY products and children's
wear. But unemployment among the young will continue to depress fashion and
music.
Verdict expects the fastest-growing products to be in consumer electronics,
where innovation and falling prices will stimulate demand. New audio and
television products are expected to show rapid growth.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Fears mount over laws on late payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small-business lobby groups pressing for companies to have a statutory right
to interest on commercial debts that are paid late said yesterday that they
believed the government would not back legislation.
They suspect that Lord Strathclyde, the small business minister, favours
non-statutory methods to persuade companies to publicise their payment
record in order to 'shame' the late payers into improving their payment
records.
The views of the lobby groups emerged amid confusion about the government's
intentions, during a consultation period which is due to end this week.
Newspaper reports suggested that tough laws could be on the way but both the
Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry were adamant yesterday
that such speculation was premature and no decisions had been taken.
According to Lord Strathclyde the government was taking the idea of
legislating on late payment 'fairly seriously' while recognising that there
was 'no point in doing it unless it will make a difference'.
He said the Federation of Small Businesses had told him it did not regard
legislation as the top priority.
Lord Strathclyde rejected the notion of imposing a standard period for
payment of debt. He said: 'People should be free to decide what the terms of
credit should be.' But he said ministers would decide on whether to
legislate on making people comply with contracts.
Companies and business groups have until Thursday to make submissions on the
government's consultative document, which was issued after Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, put the issue on the agenda in his November Budget.
The Department of Trade and Industry is expected to take a couple of months
to digest more than 200 submissions before deciding what, if anything, it
will do to address a problem that many companies say is increasingly
serious.
Some small-business lobby groups said the government showed no sign of
shedding a conviction that legislation was not the way to alleviate the
problem.
The issue has split the small-business community along some unexpected
lines. Ranked against the legislation is the Confederation of British
Industry, which says its small business members have recently become more
opposed to the legislation as it might do more harm than good.
The 58,000-strong Federation of Small Businesses - formerly the National
Federation of Self-Employed - is a cautious supporter of legislation, but
only if the government first takes other steps.
Such measures would include forcing the top 10,000 companies in the UK to
publish their payment records in their annual reports and moves to ensure
that any future legal judgments against late payers would be directly
enforceable by the courts.
Leading the campaign in favour of legislation is the 21,000-strong Forum of
Private Business, which has been joined by most of the high street banks and
the Institute of Directors.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats support legislation. Last week more than
200 MPs, including 80 Conservative backbenchers, signed an early day motion
calling for a statutory right to interest on overdue debts.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Partners meet today on accountancy merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth biggest accountancy firm, is to merge with
Binder Hamlyn, the eighth biggest, in one of the biggest consolidations in
the profession for several years.
Heads of Binder's 11 regional partnerships around the country still need to
approve the merger and they are due to meet today to discuss the proposals,
which Andersen formally made two weeks ago and laid out at a meeting last
week. Precise details are still to be worked out, but the merger would
involve no goodwill payment or other money handed over by Andersen to
Binder.
Instead, Binder partners would be offered 'units' or equity in the Andersen
partnership according to their position and influence.
A handful would be offered full partnerships in the Andersen worldwide firm,
and the rest would become members of the Andersen regional partnership for
the UK.
Any agreement is conditional on approval in some form by Binders, which is
composed of a series of semi-autonomous regional firms. Some may have
concerns about the arrangement, which was negotiated between Andersen and
Binder's senior partners for the single firm that covers London and Leeds.
Andersen is believed to be willing, however, to proceed even if the merger
involves only the London and Leeds practice, which represents more than half
of total fee income and large corporate clients. Mr Jim Wadia, Andersen's
managing partner, said yesterday: 'We have got beyond talks about talks, to
talks (about merger).'
He said there was no question of Andersen changing its name, but he had no
objection to using the Binder Hamlyn name in some form if it made commercial
sense. Such arrangements with other firms already exist in France, Japan,
south-east Asia and Sweden.
The merger would boost Andersen's client base by giving it access to about
100 quoted companies that are audited by Binder. It would also give it
access to the areas in which Binder specialises, including a personal
financial advisory service for wealthy individuals. Another advantage would
be to give Andersen access to government work, from which it has been banned
since it was sued by the government for its audit of the fraudulent De
Lorean car company in northern Ireland.
Binder has yet to respond with a formal offer, which would be shaped by how
many of the regional partnerships were willing to merge, and might involve
discussions over how the name would be used.
Mr Adrian Burn, Binder's managing partner, said: 'Talks are taking place. We
see there could be significant benefits.' He ruled out large numbers of
redundancies.
The merger could raise Andersen's presence in Germany because Binder is part
of the BDO international network which has a strong firm there.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Schools may teach first year of degree courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former polytechnics have stepped up their campaign to recruit high-quality
students by developing plans with independent schools for pupils to take the
first year of their degree course while they are still at school.
The plans are still at an early stage, and would not come into force for at
least two years, but they signify a bold attempt by the 'new' universities
to recruit pupils who would normally be earmarked for more traditional
centres of excellence such as Oxford and Cambridge.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents all UK
universities, confirmed that talks were under way with the Headmasters'
Conference - which represents leading independent boys' and mixed schools -
to allow some pupils to take units towards a degree in their final year at
school.
They would then complete their normal BA or BSc degree after two years at
the university, and spend the third year earning a masters' degree.
Studying degree-level courses alongside A-levels would be demanding, but
many independent schools could use their experience of teaching pupils for
'fourth-term' entry to Oxford and Cambridge, which also requires more
advanced teaching alongside A-level.
Schools had complained that pupils often spent their first year at
university repeating work they had already done. The initiative, which has
been taken only by new universities, is intended to solve the problems.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has not been directly involved in
the talks, but education department officials said that he was enthusiastic
about the plans.
New universities failed to meet their targets for student numbers last year,
with numbers recruited falling by 1 per cent.
'Old' universities, against which the former polytechnics competed for the
first time, expanded their intake by 7 per cent.
Former polytechnics had invested heavily in new corporate identities and
advertising, with De Montfort University - one of the leaders in the plans
for degrees in schools - spending Pounds 500,000 on a press and television
advertising campaign.
Another recent proposal from new universities which are anxious to boost
intakes involved setting their own entrance exams, to avoid heavy reliance
on A-levels, and to give applicants an earlier decision.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Churchgoer wins tribunal backing on Sunday working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A systems engineer who refused to work on a Sunday because it prevented him
from going to church has won his case for unfair dismissal from an
industrial tribunal.
This is the first time an industrial tribunal has ruled in an unfair
dismissal case based on the grounds of the applicant's religious beliefs.
Mr Andrew Dutton, who worked for Hughes Rediffusion Simulation at Crawley,
West Sussex, for five years, said: 'I am just an ordinary guy who did not
want to be forced to work Sundays. I tried hard to reach a compromise with
the company and failed.'
The company, a subsidiary of General Motors, wanted Mr Dutton to work up to
26 Sundays a year - which could have resulted in Sunday working for a
continuous 12 months - but he said that as a practising Christian he could
not.
A further hearing will set damages for Mr Dutton, but he is now without a
job.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, welcomed the tribunal's
ruling.
He said: 'The government has fostered a climate in which employers disregard
the fundamental rights of their employees in the pursuit of profit at the
expense of dignity.'
The Keep Sunday Special Campaign, which was not involved in Mr Dutton's
case, said yesterday that the affair highlighted 'the importance of securing
adequate employment protection for employees to ensure their right to
express their religious beliefs of whatever persuasion'.
The proposed limited employee protection contained in the Sunday trading
bill going through parliament covers only those in the retail trade and not
in associated industries or other sectors. Mr Dutton won his case under the
1978 Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Storm grows over tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday
attacked Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saying tax rises would be nearly
twice as much as he said.
The storm over the tax rises gathered momentum as Labour accused the
chancellor of pulling the wool over people's eyes about the increases. Ms
Harman said the average impact on households would be Pounds 10 a week and
not Pounds 5.75 as Mr Clarke said.
Ms Harman said: 'People will have to pay Pounds 500 more in tax from April.
They will be dismayed to see that they cannot trust the chancellor to tell
the truth about taxes.'
She said she thought the chancellor's Pounds 5.75 figure must include people
who were unemployed and not therefore paying income tax or National
Insurance.
Mr Clarke said concerns about the tax rises were 'exaggerated' and would
probably be forgotten in two months. Those frightened by reports about the
size of the increases would find they were not as bad as they expected.
Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record, he said the average impact, taken
across all households, would be about Pounds 5.75 a week, but this figure
would vary enormously according to individual circumstances. On Saturday he
told the Conservative central council in Plymouth that this was equivalent
to 'about three or four pints of beer a week.'
Mr Clarke dismissed claims that the tax rises would stall the recovery.
Brushing aside claims that consumer confidence was faltering, the chancellor
said business confidence was much higher than a year ago and growth was
'getting stronger all the time'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Deal on temporary ceasefire ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday ruled out any
move to admit Sinn Fein to talks on the province's future in return for a
temporary IRA ceasefire.
Sir Patrick said he would unreservedly condemn any move by Dublin to invite
Sinn Fein to its proposed Forum of Peace and Reconciliation in return for
such a step by republican leaders.
He said he was confident that the Irish government would not issue such an
invitation. 'There is nothing here between the two governments,' he said.
Reinforcing London's insistence on a permanent end to IRA violence, Sir
Patrick said a temporary ceasefire amounted to nothing more than passing 'a
suspended sentence of death' on future IRA victims. 'That is not something
that I regard as anything other than an insult and certainly nothing that
should attract any response of any positive character.'
He added: 'How can anybody be interested in a temporary ceasefire when it is
no more than a threat to pick it up again in six months' time or six
minutes' time?'
But speaking on BBC TV's On The Record, Sir Patrick refused to make clear
whether lines of communication with republican leaders were still open.
Pressed on the subject, he replied: 'I have said to the House of Commons
that if there is to be any further communication with the IRA or Sinn Fein
before they have declared a permanent end to violence and stopped supporting
it . . . nothing will be passed down that chain of communication that is
other than what is being said publicly.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / Clarke reforms 'heading for chaos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the tax system risked triggering 'unprecedented chaos', Mr Malcolm
Gammie, president of the Institute of Taxation, warned on Saturday.
Mr Gammie said there had been more tax legislation in his presidential year
than in any previous year since the institute was founded in 1930. He said
the latest finance bill was longer than any of its predecessors and the
volume was likely to go on rising.
He was speaking at a conference of the institute in Cambridge as it emerged
that the institute, one of the leading bodies for tax practitioners in the
country, had been granted a royal charter.
Mr Gammie called for improvements in the way tax law was drafted, reviewed
and approved by parliament in order to 'bring it into the 20th century'. He
said the length was 'beyond the grasp of those that must handle it within
the time allowed'.
He criticised suggestions that lengthy laws were required because of tax
avoidance, and said they reflected instead a policy to tax things which were
difficult to tax.
Mr Gammie said there had been little debate on whether the system was
desirable.
He called for a proper debate on tax policy and the resulting complexities
and warned that otherwise there was a risk of growing executive power
without effective scrutiny.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Hardship fears for travellers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A children's charity fears proposed legislation in the criminal justice and
public order bill to be debated in parliament today will 'cause considerable
hardship' for travellers and gypsies.
If passed, the bill would give local authorities and police extensive new
powers to evict families from unauthorised sites.
Mr Michael Taylor, Save the Children's UK director, said it would mean the
frequent eviction of travellers and gypsies who could be forced into moving
constantly from one illegal stopping place to another.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Tory split on nurses pay plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory MPs are split on the idea of productivity-related pay for nurses, says
a survey published yesterday.
The survey, carried out for Unison, the health workers' union, suggested
that 43 per cent of Conservative MPs thought productivity-related pay was
undesirable, while 55 per cent supported it.
The poll of 100 MPs showed that 94 per cent of Labour MPs were against the
idea.
It found that 35 per cent of Tories thought such a system would be bad for
morale in nursing, while 54 per cent took the opposite view.
But just over half of the Tories believed a productivity-related scheme
could be introduced.

FT  28 MAR 94 / London Tecs fail to unite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business advice services may remain fragmented in London because Training
and Enterprise Councils in the capital are failing to make a joint bid to
the government for an all-London advice and counselling service, Lisa Wood
writes.
It is understood that after nearly a year of talks Tecs on the outskirts of
London believe that they have more in common with Tecs and business
customers in areas such as the Thames Valley and Sussex than with Tecs and
businesses in the centre of London.
One London Tec director said: 'The outer London Tecs felt the inner London
ones were ganging up on them.'
The slow progress highlights the problems of the nine London Tecs. There are
still few examples of co-operation in their main activities - the
administration of government training programmes and promotion of economic
development.
A year ago London Tecs were awarded Pounds 250,000 by the Department of
Trade and Industry to work with partners including the London Chamber of
Commerce to create a unified advice service under the Business Link banner.
Business Link is the brand name of a new initiative which seeks to bring
together, throughout England and Wales, the plethora of organisations
offering advice to businesses. In most areas the outlets, which have not yet
been launched nationally, involve only one Tec and its local chamber of
commerce, and sometimes other partners including enterprise agencies.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Mrs Gracey's battle to spike terrorist guns: A campaign to
expose intimidation in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Patrick Gracey's lucky day when he was shot in the leg by IRA gunmen
on wasteland behind a West Belfast bar.
The gun jammed, preventing a second shot aimed at the base of his spine. His
abductors call the intended punishment a '50-50' - reflecting the target's
chances of ever walking again. As they left, they threw him 10 pence to make
a telephone call for help.
Mr Gracey's crime was to pick a fight on a minibus with the wrong person.
The result was a six-month campaign of intimidation against him, his wife
and their young child, culminating in his lunchtime punishment shooting off
the Falls Road.
But, in shooting Mr Gracey on July 13 1990, the IRA unwittingly picked a
fight with his mother. On news of her son's shooting, Mrs Nancy Gracey drove
through red traffic lights in a blind fury to the house of a man she
regarded as a local IRA 'godfather'. Confronting him in his living room, she
was angered by his indifference. He offered her a cup of tea. The Roman
Catholic mother of nine vowed to fight him and everything he stood for.
Mrs Gracey went on to the hospital to see her son, where she met another
mother at the bedside of her own boy, a Protestant victim of loyalist
extremists. 'We were both crying for our sons. It made no sense.'
Overnight, she decided to employ the most powerful weapon at her disposal to
launch a personal campaign against intimidation. Enlisting the help of
newspapers and broadcasters, she set about highlighting what she saw as the
hypocrisy and lies employed by all paramilitaries in trying to impose their
perverted code of justice on local communities.
Her family, frightened for her life, pleaded with her not to do it. 'I told
them the only way to stop me was to put a bullet through my head. My life
has not been easy but I was damned if I was going to let scum take and hurt
my son and get away with it.'
The reaction was rapid and overwhelming. 'The stories of beatings,
shootings, protection payments and banishments poured in. There is so much
fear, so many people desperately wanting help,' Mrs Gracey says.
In August 1990 she formed Families Against Intimidation and Terror (Fait) to
help fight cases in which individuals or entire families find themselves
under threat. The organisation, which now has a core of 15 volunteers and
gets a Pounds 37,000 annual grant from the government, has achieved some
important successes on behalf of victims.
The case of Mr Micky William is typical. A Londonderry father of 12, he was
branded an IRA informer and forced to leave the country because he alerted
the police to an incident in a neighbouring house. 'We publicised the truth
and the IRA had to back down. The local communities just won't stand for
it.'
In another incident an IRA list circulated with the names of 200 Roman
Catholics ordered to leave their areas was publicised, and subsequently
withdrawn.
Recently, however, loyalist extremists have been responsible for the
majority of reported cases of intimidation. 'Many of the accusations from
both sides are total fabrications. They will pin anything on someone singled
out for treatment,' Mrs Gracey stresses.
Her group believes at least 200 people a year are having to leave Northern
Ireland under threat of mutilation or death, with many more expelled from
their home towns. Last week in Belfast two men were found with gun wounds
after incidents bearing the hallmarks of punishment shootings, while an
Armagh mother publicly appealed to the IRA to lift a two-year banishment
order on her son following allegations against him of 'anti-social
behaviour'.
Mrs Gracey says that, for the paramilitaries, 'anti-social' activity usually
means criminal behaviour which they have not sanctioned. 'We are talking
about a Mafia which is not prepared to give up its wealth and go back on the
dole. Visions of 'Mother Ireland' don't come into it.'
She is convinced that by publicising paramilitary terror tactics the
organisation has, in particular, helped stem overseas support for the IRA.
The stubborn, angry founder of Fait, who has herself been on the receiving
end of threats ever since the campaign began, says people in Ulster have had
enough: 'It's the ordinary people who hold the key. They have the power to
get rid of these people if they make clear they will not tolerate them.
'We were told we wouldn't last six months but we are still here and intend
to go on showing up these people for the lying, murdering hypocrites that
they are.' No-one who knows Mrs Gracey doubts her determination.

FT  28 MAR 94 / California faces huge revenue refund / Assessing Barclays'
tax suit as it reaches the US Supreme Court today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank will have its chance today to argue in the US Supreme Court
its 17-year-old case against California's unitary tax system.
The British banking group, backed by an array of European governments and
multinational corporations, complains that the unitary method of assessment,
by which California calculates tax on a proportion of a group's worldwide
income, unfairly taxes profits earned outside the state, and even outside
the US.
The nine justices of the court are to hear arguments on the Barclays case,
with a similar case brought by Colgate-Palmolive, the household products
group, which challenges the application of unitary taxation to US-owned
groups.
For California, which tiptoes along the brink of bankruptcy year after year,
the stakes are high. If it were to lose the Barclays case, it would have to
refund to the bank and other foreign groups about Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m)
it has already collected, and cancel another Dollars 400m it has assessed
but not yet collected. If, on top of that, it were to lose to Colgate, it
would have to refund another Dollars 1.3bn and cancel Dollars 2bn more in
assessments.
Mr Brad Sherman, chairman of the state Board of Equalisation, an elected tax
commission, says losing the Dollars 4.1bn at stake would be 'an economic
aftershock rivalling the damage done by the southern California
earthquakes'.
For foreign companies the issue is less financial, since California last
year passed legislation that wipes out most of their objections to unitary
taxation, also known as worldwide combination. The new law allows tax-payers
to elect instead to be taxed under a 'water's edge' assessment that excludes
all income earned outside the US.
Even so, many companies and foreign governments fear that losing the case
could encourage California and other states to move back to unitary
taxation, which they see as threatening the whole structure of international
tax law.
'There are many UK, German and Japanese companies which have made the
water's edge election, even though it costs them more, because of their
emotional opposition to the concept of worldwide combination,' said Mr
Michael Lippman, partner for state and local tax issues at KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accounting group.
International tax treaties are built on the principle of arm's length
taxation - a company's income on transactions with its parent and
subsidiaries is assessed as though it were trading at arm's length with an
independent company.
Many US states, and some members of Congress, complain that this is
impossible to calculate and allows multinationals to manipulate the transfer
prices on transactions within the group so as to reduce their tax.
Senator Byron Dorgan last week persuaded the Senate to pass a non-binding
resolution in favour of unitary taxation, which uses a simple formula to
calculate how much tax is owed in each state or country. 'Our current system
is a huge bureaucracy that can't keep up with sophisticated multinationals
that juggle income and avoid paying billions that should go to the US
Treasury,' he said.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1983, in the Container Corporation case, that
California's unitary system was legal when applied to US companies, but it
expressly set aside the question of whether that could be applied to foreign
businesses.
The essence of the Barclays case is that unitary taxation, because it
conflicts with the arm's length principle preferred in international tax
treaties, interferes with the federal government's right to speak for the US
with a single voice on international commerce and is therefore
unconstitutional.
California responds that Congress has made its will very clear by refusing
many opportunities to pass a law to ban unitary taxation by the states.
Colgate's case is that to exempt foreign but not domestic companies from
unitary taxation would be unfair. To win, it would have to persuade the
Supreme Court to overturn, at least in part, its earlier Container decision.
Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's conservative ideologue, is
expected to lead support for California, in line with his usual position
that, in the absence of explicit congressional action, the court should not
interfere with the states. He is likely to receive the backing of Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas.
On the other side, Justice Harry Blackmun was the lone dissenting voice last
year in a case lost by Itel Corp against a Tennessee state tax. Judge
Blackmun argued strongly against interpreting congressional silence as
assent.
The loneliest person in the court may be Mr Drew Days, US solicitor-general,
who has the unenviable task of sustaining a brief that, in fulfilment of a
campaign promise by President Bill Clinton, supports California, while not
wholly repudiating the Justice Department's earlier briefs filed in support
of Barclays.
Washington lawyers expect the justices to question Mr Days harshly over this
intellectual juggling act.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Venezuelan rebel released from jail

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan army officer who led an unsuccessful military uprising
against the government in early 1992 and became a popular political hero was
released from jail at the weekend after President Rafael Caldera had ordered
a halt to all court martial proceedings against him.
On his release, Lt-Col Hugo Chavez Frias, who has resigned from the army,
told hundreds of supporters he would work with his own organisation 'to gain
political power' and 'to show political schemers how a nation should achieve
its true destiny'. He also warned it would be 'risky' to talk about another
coup d'etat in Venezuela.
The rebel leader's release forms part of a political 'pacification' by the
president, who took office in February. He has ordered charges dropped
against officers facing courts martial over the 1992 military uprisings,
which left 300 dead.
Fewer than 20 officers are still behind bars because of the coup attempts,
and a group of officers is in exile in Peru.
Lt-Col Chavez headed a rebellion against the government of President Carlos
Andres Perez, who survived two coup attempts in 1992 but was forced to leave
office in 1993 to face corruption charges.
Reuter reports from Lima: Thirty-four of the exiled Venezuelan officers left
Peru yesterday on a Venezuelan air force flight after talks with negotiators
sent to Lima by President Caldera. Sixteen Venezuelan officers remain exiled
in Peru.

The US is planning to shift its policy on Haiti so as to put more pressure
on the military leaders who took over the Caribbean country two and a half
years ago, according to a report in the New York Times, George Graham writes
from Washington.
The report said Vice-President Al Gore had briefed Father Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, on a new plan calling for three
steps on the same day: the military leaders would step down, the Haitian
parliament would confirm a new prime minister named by Fr Aristide, and an
amnesty for the coup leaders would be enacted.
The US administration's policy on Haiti has come in for stern criticism in
the last few weeks from Democratic members of the US Congress, there having
been a particularly fierce attack last week from the black caucus in
Congress.

The Organisation of American States yesterday elected Mr Cesar Gaviria, the
president of Colombia, to be its new secretary-general, George Graham
reports from Washington.
Mr Gaviria's election, by 20 votes to 14, capped a sometimes hostile
campaign in which smaller OAS members, in the Caribbean and Central America,
complained that their interests were being trampled by the heavyweight
countries of South America, as well as by the US.
The smaller states had backed Mr Bernd Niehaus, foreign minister of Costa
Rica, to succeed Mr Joao Baena Soares of Brazil, the outgoing
secretary-general.
Each country has one vote but the alliance of the small appears to have
broken up in the face of Mr Gaviria's candidacy.
Mr Gaviria is due to step down as president of Colombia in August.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The race to succeed Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as the presidential candidate of
Mexico's ruling party reached fever pitch at the weekend, even as the party
sought to quash rumours that the nomination was imminent.
Members of the Institutional Revolutionary party's (PRI) old guard seemed
set on a desperate and probably futile effort to block the candidacy of the
favourite, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the campaign manager of Mr Colosio, who was
assassinated on Wednesday.
Mr Zedillo, a former budget minister with an economics doctorate from Yale
University in the US, represents the modern, pro-reform wing of the party.
Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, party president, tried to quell speculation, saying
no one in the party was authorised to comment on possible candidates: 'The
PRI, like all of Mexico, is in mourning. This is a time of reflection for
all of us. In due time we will initiate internal processes to select our new
candidate.'
Mr Ramiro de la Rosa, head of Democracy 2000, a faction in the PRI, urged
President Carlos Salinas to let the party choose its candidate without
presidential interference. Mr de la Rosa's group backed Mr Ortiz Arana,
presumed favourite of the party rank and file, as candidate.
A government official said it had still not decided how the candidate would
be chosen. But the expectation is that Mr Salinas will select the candidate,
after consultation with party officials and ministers.
As Mr Colosio's campaign manager, Mr Zedillo is likely to be projected as
the legitimate heir of the slain candidate.
The PRI still maintains that the candidate could be chosen as late as next
week. However, if speculation increases it may have to be more quickly.
Meanwhile, Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the main leftist opposition
party, has demanded an independent investigation into the murder of Mr
Colosio. He believes Mr Mario Aburto, who has confessed to killing Mr
Colosio, may have been paid by organised groups in the country.
Mr Aburto initially told investigators that he had links with such organised
groups, but refused to name them. He also said that he would not talk unless
tortured, indicating that he might have been part of a wider organisation,
or wanted investigators to believe he was.
A government official said: 'At this point there is no indication Mr Aburto
was working for anyone else'.
Police say they found a drawing in Mr Aburto's home depicting his soul
entering the body of Mr Colosio, and another of the two floating up to
heaven. In the view of the police, this suggested mental instability.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Iberia's deal with Argentina blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Argentine federal judge has ordered the government not to proceed with an
agreement, signed 10 days ago with Iberia, Spain's national airline, to
settle their dispute over Aerolneas Argentinas, the flag carrier.
Judge Oscar Garzon Funes accepted an appeal from the leftist Frente Grande
opposition party that the settlement was against the national interest
because it handed the airline to a foreign government.
Mr Javier Salas, Iberia's president, and Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine
economy minister, had agreed to let Iberia raise its stake in Aerolneas to
85 from 30 per cent after pumping the equivalent of Dollars 500m (Pounds
334m) in fresh capital into the company.
The government said it would appeal against the judge's decision. It might
demanding a ruling by the Supreme Court, where most of the judges were
appointed by the privatising President Carlos Menem.
The deal also called for the abolition of the Argentine air force's
profitable ground-handling monopoly at the country's airports. This has led
to strong objections by the Defence Ministry.
Iberia says it could save Dollars 20m a year by servicing its aircraft. The
handling charge for a Boeing 747 in Buenos Aires is Dollars 4,000, compared
with Dollars 1,400 in Santiago, Chile.
Iberia and the government have been bickering over loss-making Aerolneas
since it was privatised in November 1990. The government had to take back
part of the airline in 1992 to prevent its collapse. It rejected Iberia's
demand last year that it contribute to the capital injection.

South Korean President Kim Young-sam will mix business with diplomacy during

Economic issues that will be discussed include the Chinese purchase of
Korean telephone exchanges, a proposed Sino-Korea project to develop and
market mid-sized commercial airliners and the participation of Korean
industry in China's infrastructure programme.
The two countries also plan to form an industrial co-operation committee to
promote business ties and technology exchanges.
North Korea has accused Washington and Seoul of risking a 'catastrophic
crisis' by putting their armed forces personnel on alert on the Korean
peninsula, Reuter adds from Tokyo.
'These provocative moves are very dangerous developments which may cause a
catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula,' said the official Korean

FT  28 MAR 94 / Green shoots start to appear in Japan: Conditions for
economic recovery 'in place'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy appears to have touched the bottom of its
two-and-a-half-year downturn, according to a growing number of private and
public sector forecasters in Tokyo.
Their cautious optimism is based on a series of encouraging economic
statistics over the past few weeks, showing a pick-up in consumer demand, a
slowdown in the decline of corporate profits, and a reduction in the ratio
of companies feeling gloomy about the future.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan - one of the most cautious
forecasters - believes the conditions for a recovery are in place, though he
sees no sign yet that a rebound has begun. The bank's latest monthly
economic report says the economy 'appears to have stopped weakening'.
Japan's green shoots, as recorded by various government departments and
agencies, include a 0.7 per cent increase in consumer spending between the
third and fourth quarters of last year, and a 6.2 per cent year-on-year
decline in average corporate profits in the final quarter, compared with a
21.6 per cent fall in the previous three months.
There is also a fall in the relative balance between businesses feeling
optimistic and pessimistic. In December, the share of companies feeling
negative exceeded those feeling positive by 13.1 percentage points, down
from 22.1 points in November.
There was a 0.9 per cent increase in industrial production from December to
January. Output in January was still 3.1 per cent down on the month in 1993,
but the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the central bank
both think that industrial production will show a year-on-year rise in the
first quarter of 1994, which they would recognise as the first sign of an
upturn.
The mean forecast is for a rise in gross domestic product of 0.3 per cent
this year, after the near stagnation of 0.1 per cent in 1993, according to
the latest quarterly survey of economic surveys by Consensus Economics, a
private consultancy. Within this, 12 of the 19 economists questioned believe
growth will be above the mean forecast.
Mr Brian Rose, senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research, which is
forecasting 0.9 per cent growth this year, said that up to December, most
monthly data were negative, but from January, most numbers have been
positive.
'The numbers could not have gone on going down for ever, but the recovery
will be weak,' Mr Rose said.

FT  28 MAR 94 / S Korea leader treads carefully in China: Kim Young-sam's
plea for Beijing pressure on Pyongyang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam will today become the second regional
leader in a week to urge China to exert pressure on North Korea to open its
nuclear sites to international inspection.
But Mr Kim, who arrived in Beijing yesterday, is likely to advocate a more
patient approach than did Japan's prime minister, who last week told Chinese
leaders of Tokyo's 'grave concern' at Korean developments and warned of UN
Security Council action.
Even so, South Korea's president will seek to impress on Chinese officials
the gravity of the situation after decisions by Pyongyang and Seoul to put
their armies on high alert. The US is also taking steps to bolster its
military presence in the region.
Mr Kim is due to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin today and Premier Li
Peng tomorrow to discuss North Korea. This will be the South Korean leader's
first visit to Beijing as president.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, said yesterday, before
leaving Seoul for Beijing, that the Security Council should allow more time
for North Korea to live up to its obligations under the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
He said a statement from the Security Council president would be desirable
rather than a formal resolution urging Pyongyang to open its sites to
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection: 'It could be better
that a statement be issued to induce the North Koreans to come forward for a
dialogue. If North Korea continues not to allow nuclear inspections, even
after the statement is issued, then China cannot but go along with UN
resolutions.'
South Korea's approach matches that of Beijing. China, as one of the five
permanent members of the Security Council, is anxious to avoid, at this
stage, a vote on a formal resolution about its ally, North Korea.
The US has been circulating a draft resolution warning of further
unspecified action if North Korea fails to adhere to its NPT obligations. It
recommends that Pyongyang be given a month in which to co-operate with the
IAEA. The US is reported to have said that it might go along with the
approach advocated by China provided it was clear that economic sanctions
would be considered if North Korea failed to comply.
China has made no secret of its concern that it might face unpalatable
diplomatic choices over the Korean issue. Chinese officials have ruled out
support at this stage for economic sanctions and have criticised a decision
by the US and South Korea to resume joint military exercises. Mr Wu Jianmin,
foreign ministry spokesman, said last week China was 'not in favour of any
action detrimental to stability (on the Korean peninsula) such as military
exercises'.
He also made clear at a news briefing that China believed it would be
dangerous to push North Korea into a corner. Chinese officials have been
suggesting that the US consider moves towards diplomatic relations with
Pyongyang as a way to defuse the crisis.
China wants to try to forestall punitive economic sanctions under which it
might be obliged to cut off petroleum and food supplies to North Korea. That
would be almost certain to cause a deep rupture in relations.
The South Korean foreign minister will fly to Washington from Beijing this
week for talks with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and Mr
William Perry, US defence secretary.
Mr Perry said at the weekend that he had ordered the US Air Force to add to
its stockpiles of munitions and spare parts in South Korea. He was also
deploying new Apache attack helicopters - used devastatingly against Iraqi
tanks in the Gulf war.
The secretary told reporters in Washington that his department planned 'to
take every step we can' so that US tactical air capability could be applied
in a day or two rather than a week or two.
The US, which has 36,000 troops based in South Korea, has been enhancing
that country's defences, including the deployment of Patriot missiles
against any Scud missile attacks.
North Korea, which has some 1m men and women under arms, has stepped up
military drills and issued bellicose threats. It has also intensified
propaganda broadcasts calling for the overthrow of the Seoul government.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Seoul calm while world media panic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I don't worry about a war breaking out,' said Ms Choi Kwang-hun as she
peered from the observation deck of Seoul Tower at the city that North Korea
recently said it would turn into 'a sea of fire'.
Ms Choi, a housewife in her mid-forties, and most of the city's other 10m
residents appear calm in spite of the threats of war traded between North
and South Korea over the past week.
Although the subject of war has become a dominant topic of conversation, it
has had little affect on life in the sprawling environs of Seoul, only 35
miles from the North Korean border. There are few, if any, outward signs of
preparations for an emergency.
Indeed, it is the rest of the world that seems more concerned over a
possible military attack from the North. Panic selling of Korean stocks by
foreign investors helped cause the bourse's general index to fall by 2.3 per
cent last week.
Hotels are reporting cancellations by overseas tourists, casting a pall over
what has been proclaimed as 'Visit Korea Year'.
'The general feeling among many Koreans is that the crisis is the result of
international media hysteria,' said one US-educated Korean businessman.
The relaxed attitude displayed by South Koreans reflects that the country
has lived with a threat from the North for 40 years, with tensions rising
and falling regularly.
Koreans have also developed a fatalistic attitude after a century of
invasions and political upheaval.
But there are clear generation differences in reactions. Middle-aged
Koreans, who grew up with the Korean War of 1950-53 and remember UN troops
saving their destitute country, believe that international support will
resolve the dispute this time. 'I believe the US and the UN will prevent a
war from happening,' said Ms Choi.
But younger Koreans, whose national self-confidence has grown with the
country's rapid economic progress, blame the US for aggravating tensions by
deploying US Patriot missiles.
They are also more sceptical about the seriousness of the threat that the
North poses. 'The former military governments used to use the North Korean
threat as a justification for keeping the people under authoritarian
control,' said one student. 'Conservative hardliners may be using this to
assert their power once again by giving maximum publicity to war-like
statements from the north.'
There is also a sharp divide in reactions among Seoul's foreign expatriates.
'The old-timers are taking this in stride, while the newcomers are ready to
pack their bags and leave,' said Mr Alan Plumb, the long-time head of the
Rolls-Royce office in Seoul.
When a London broker recently rang in the middle of the night to ask about
rumours that war was about to break out, 'I couldn't get back to sleep,'
confesses Ms Anne Lowell, an analyst for Baring Securities in Seoul.
Discussions among foreigners have focused on evacuation plans if the North
Koreans invade.
Those who live on the trendy south side of the Han River, which divides the
city as the Thames does London, count themselves lucky since it would be
easier to flee.
Those living north of the river worry about the destruction of 19 bridges
that would leave them trapped.
The evacuation procedures drawn up by the US military to get foreigners out
of the city did not inspire confidence. Foreign citizens would have to
gather at the big US military base at Yongsan in central Seoul, considered a
prime target for North Korean Scud missiles and artillery.
They would then leave the city by bus, a formidable feat at the best of
times given Seoul's notorious traffic jams. 'Personally, I'm relying on a
good pair of trainers instead,' said one US official.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress said yesterday that it would escalate mass
protest action aimed at ensuring free political activity in the strife-torn
Natal province, where ANC and Inkatha Freedom party members clashed again at
the weekend over preparations for next month's all-race elections.
Government officials said Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi met
President FW de Klerk for a five-hour meeting on Saturday, at which he gave
assurances that free campaigning would be allowed in the KwaZulu homeland
which he heads, and that elections could take place there despite Inkatha's
poll boycott.
However, his supporters appeared to have ignored these assurances yesterday,
when armed Zulus occupied a stadium in northern Natal where the ANC was to
have held an election rally. It was the third weekend in a row that Inkatha
had prevented an election rally in Natal.
Officials said they hoped that Chief Buthelezi's assurances to Mr de Klerk
would defuse the immediate crisis over Natal, and help persuade the ANC to
defer its demands that some of the chief's powers be suspended and a state
of emergency declared.
The ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body
overseeing government in the run-up to elections, is to meet again today to
discuss the crisis.
Chief Buthelezi said at the weekend that a troop deployment 'could be seen
as an invasion'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Coca-Cola faces Tokyo penalty tax
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese tax authorities have charged Coca-Cola Japan, a subsidiary of
the world's largest soft drinks company, with a penalty tax bill of Y15bn
(Pounds 96m) for improper income transfers.
The country's National Tax Administration Agency has ruled that Y36bn in
brand and marketing royalty payments, which Coca-Cola transferred to its US
parent during the three years to March 1992, were too high. It has demanded
an extra tax payment.
Coca-Cola said the decision would not affect its earning prospects, due to
likely tax redemptions in the US, but it made clear it would reject the
demand. Mr Roi Suzuki, president of Coca-Cola Japan, said the royalties were
based on the immeasurable value of Coca-Cola's trademark and were fair and
reasonable.
The Japanese decision comes amid rising anxiety over the US government's
moves to tighten its tax grip on foreign multinationals operating in the US.
Tax authorities there have claimed that multinationals often abuse
international transfer price rules which state that goods and services sold
from one group company to another should be priced as though sold to any
outside company.
By setting higher or lower transfer prices, multinational companies,
including Japanese vehicle and electronics makers, are accused of shifting
their US profits abroad to avoid US taxation.
In 1992 the US Internal Revenue Service ruled that Kawasaki Heavy Industries
had been avoiding US taxes and charged itY1.2bn. Last year Nissan Motor paid
Y17bn in penalty taxes.

FT  28 MAR 94 / South Korea favours UN statement on North's nuclear problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, said at the weekend that
his country would support the UN Security Council's issuing a statement on
the North Korea nuclear problem rather than taking the tougher action of
adopting a resolution on the matter, writes John Burton from Seoul.
He explained that this strategy would persuade China to support a resolution
criticising North Korea if it still continued to block international nuclear
inspections after the statement was issued. 'I believe that it's advisable
to start with the council president's statement so that a resolution can be
adopted unanimously,' he said.
South Korean President Kim Young-sam will mix business with diplomacy during
his visit to China, hoping to win new orders for Korean companies. Economic
issues that will be discussed include the Chinese purchase of Korean
telephone exchanges and a proposed Sino-Korea project to develop and market
mid-sized commercial airliners.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Recession hits groups in Europe

<TEXT>
Japanese companies manufacturing in Europe were badly hit by the recession
last year and their poor performance has led to a sharp fall in their
investment plans.
More than half the 728 Japanese manufacturing groups in Europe say they lost
money last year and the operating results of 47 per cent of them
deteriorated, according to a survey conducted by the Japan External Trade
Organisation.
The study showed that 83 per cent of companies had been hurt by the
recession in Europe. More than a third had dismissed employees, scaled back
their manufacturing plans or abandoned intended investments. Only 45 per
cent of them intend to increase their investment, compared with 68 per cent
in 1992.
The UK remained the most popular location for new Japanese manufacturing
investment, with nine companies setting up operations there, making a total
of 206. Italy enjoyed the next largest increase, up seven to 52 companies.
An additional two groups located in France, the second most popular country
with 121 Japanese groups.
However, Germany registered a fall, down two at 106, the first decline there
since the survey began in 1983. The Netherlands also lost one company,
leaving 45 groups there.
The survey showed most Japanese companies believed they were benefiting from
the single European market. Only 4 per cent viewed integration as negative.
More than 62 per cent said customs procedures had been simplified, while 52
per cent reported their markets had grown, and 46 per cent had profited from
lower distribution costs. However, 40 per cent said integration favoured
European companies more than Japanese groups.
More than 70 per cent of the companies polled said they obtained more than
half of their parts or raw materials locally. This was partly because of the
strength of the yen, and partly a fall in the prices of locally produced
materials. About 57 per cent of Japanese companies had appointed a European
as a director or in a higher post.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Foreign securities firms to join Shanghai exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SHANGHAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Shanghai Securities Exchange is planning to let foreign securities firms
become members, under a reform that would eliminate the need for them to
trade through Chinese brokers.
The reform, planned for this year, would mark a further step in the
liberalisation of China's financial markets, and boost Shanghai's effort to
grow into one of the world's leading financial centres.
Foreign investment banks have been rushing to set up offices in the city to
take advantage of the boom in joint ventures between overseas companies and
Chinese enterprises, as well as the flow of new equity listings.
Twenty-one foreign securities houses have seats on the exchange and can
trade so-called B shares in Chinese companies to foreign investors, but they
are not allowed to be members of the exchange.
This means that they must pay about 20 per cent of their share trading
commissions to seven local brokers which act as partners. Investors buying B
shares pay about 0.7 per cent of the value of trades in commissions.
However, officials of the Shanghai exchange are planning to create a new
category of 'special' membership that would allow foreign firms to operate
freely, although without voting rights.
Ms Li Qian, a director of the exchange's international department, said that
some local brokers were unhappy about the plan, but the exchange believed it
was a necessary step in the market's liberalisation. 'The local brokers do
not agree, but we have to take the long-term view for the development of the
exchange,' she said.
Barings, the British merchant bank, opened an office in Shanghai last week
and other UK securities houses are following their lead. American banks have
been increasing their strength in the city.
Foreign brokers have been pressing for the unification of the B shares with
the A shares that only Chinese investors can buy. Foreign companies have
also expressed interest in secondary listings on the Shanghai exchange.
The exchange has grown rapidly in the past two years, reaching a total
market capitalisation of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27.3bn) last year. The
exchange estimates that about 5m people now hold share accounts at the
Shanghai exchange.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 10,000 Kurdish demonstrators began pulling out of Mannheim yesterday
after German police offered to release detained Kurds if protesters
dispersed, Reuter reports.
Police said between 7,000 and 10,000 Kurds had ignored a ban and got past
police road blocks to rally in the southwestern city at a wake for two
Kurdish women who set themselves ablaze in protest at German arms sales to
Turkey. They waved banners charging Bonn with complicity in 'Turkey's war of
genocide in Kurdistan', shouted anti-Turkish slogans and punched the air
with victory signs.
Police used scores of water cannon to try to disperse the protesters.

<TEXT>
Ms Bronwyn Bishop, the former New South Wales senator who is considered a
potential challenger for the opposition Liberal party leadership, won the
Mackellar by-election comfortably at the weekend, writes Niki Tait in
Sydney. The victory allows her to move from the Senate to the House of
Representatives, an essential precondition to mounting any leadership bid.
The by-election, in a safe Liberal seat, was not contested by the governing
Labor party. Nevertheless, several independents and representatives of minor
parties stood against Ms Bishop, and the result was a swing of just over 5
per cent against the Liberal party.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Italian Elections: Zeffirelli writes himself into the
Italian political scenario - Andrew Hill has lunch with the great director
who is standing in Catania, Sicily, for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the eve of Italy's most important general election since 1948, Mr Franco
Zeffirelli, film director and would-be senator of the Italian republic, took
lunch on the slopes of Mount Etna with members of his entourage and three of
his eight Jack Russell terriers.
For a man known for opulent and often controversial stage and cinema
productions, it was a suitably lofty viewpoint from which to survey his
constituency - Catania, a city of decaying splendour on the east coast of
Sicily.
But this is not the image which Franco Zeffirelli the candidate has sought
to promote, during an arduous campaign for Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza
Italia. Indeed, since the media magnate asked Mr Zeffirelli to scendere in
campo (take to the field) for his new party, the film director has done just
that, leaving what he calls the 'glass prison' of show business and talking
to people in the streets. 'I think I'm a much better man for it,' he said in
an interview with the FT at the weekend.
Catania is a difficult constituency, not least because of the traditional
apathy of the electorate in southern Italy, where the turnout is always
lower than in the north. Yesterday, Palm Sunday, there was more activity in
Catania's churches than in its polling stations, and Sicilian television
reported a much lower turnout than in 1992 - although this time all Italians
have a full two days in which to vote.
More specifically, the city suffers from a disintegrating infrastructure,
and is struggling to shake off a reputation as centre for one of the most
powerful Mafia 'families', whose head, Mr Nitto Santapaola, was arrested
last year. A constant theme of the last days of the election campaign was
the question of how the Mafia will vote, with Mr Berlusconi severely
criticised by his opponents for not clearly rejecting the support of Cosa
Nostra.
Meanwhile, his business lieutenants have been forced to deny allegations by
former gang members that Mafia-inspired arson attacks on his new Standa
supermarkets in Catania and Palermo in 1990 and 1991 only stopped after
pay-offs to the local clans.
Mr Zeffirelli has stepped into this delicate situation as an outsider,
albeit one who knows and loves Sicily. His roots are in Florence, and he was
also mooted as a Forza Italia candidate for Rome or Venice. But he chose
Sicily because he wanted to dispel some of the myths about the island - in
particular, its association with the Mafia in the minds of most foreigners -
and reassure Sicilians that they, too, are part of the new Italy.
'It isn't the country of 'The Godfather' for god's sake: it's a country of
wonderfully creative and beautiful people who want to do the best with their
lives,' he complains.
He says that, if elected, he would try to restrict himself to certain
specific areas of policy, notably helping disabled people and drug addicts,
and to resurrecting the cultural life of Italy from what he sees as 50 years
of communist-inspired neglect.
'I'm not a baby,' says Mr Zeffirelli, who is 70. 'I want to see things
happen now.'
Indeed, had he started in politics 20 years ago, and devoted himself to it,
one could imagine Franco Zeffirelli as a campaigning minister of culture
along the lines of the late Melina Mercouri in Greece, an example he himself
cites. Mr Zeffirelli calls it a national disgrace that Italy has no culture
ministry, but at the same time rules himself out as a candidate for such a
post.
As it is, he is not clear how he would reconcile his parliamentary duties
with forthcoming directorial commitments, which include film productions of
'Jane Eyre' this summer, and a life of opera star Maria Callas, which he
should start filming next winter.
What is clear is Mr Zeffirelli's commitment to Forza Italia as a strong
alternative to the former communists and socialists in the opposing
Progressive Alliance. As part of his campaign, the director has been
distributing a lapel badge with a picture of Zeffirelli looking genial and
relaxed. His aides call it 'The Smile', but behind it is an unsynthetic
anger about the way in which the left has recycled itself for this election.
'The old nomenklatura are absolutely awful: they just don't deserve to
survive,' he says, in one of his milder attacks. Mr Zeffirelli is certainly
not uncomfortable about the pact between Forza Italia and the far-right
National Alliance, particularly important in the south. Indeed, the director
says he is 'disgusted' by the description of the National Alliance as a
neo-fascist party, and describes Mr Gianfranco Fini, the Alliance's
politically adept leader, as 'the greatest statesman we have'.
As for international criticism of Forza Italia, Mr Zeffirelli - used to
criticism of the artistic kind - draws a parallel between the new Italian
republic promised by Mr Berlusconi and his allies, and the first Florentine
republic set up in the 14th century. 'They (the Florentines) were surrounded
by emperors, popes, dukes and counts, all of whom looked at Florence with
fear - and they did all they could to make it fall.'
He leaves a dramatic pause and then adds, with that smile: 'They finally
managed to bring it down - but it took 200 years.'

FT  28 MAR 94 / Germany forecast to hamper EU recovery: Bank report sees
only 1.6% growth across Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German economic 'stagnation' will hold back recovery across Europe,
according to a report published today by Barclays Bank of the UK.
Bonn's problems in the financing of eastern Germany, and a continuing fall
in industrial competitiveness, mean that real gross national product growth
in the European Union this year will reach only 1.6 per cent, compared with
an estimated fall of 0.3 per cent in 1993, the bank believes.
German recovery will be 'late, partly because the Bundesbank has adopted a
cautious approach to reducing interest rates,' says its report.
By 1995, GNP growth in the EU will be 2.5 per cent 'but this is no more than
a return to trend'.
The importance of Germany to the health of Europe's economy is, if anything,
increasing. 'In the past it has been difficult for Europe to stage a robust
upswing without Germany,' writes the report's author, Mr Nigel Newman,
Barclays' senior European economist.
'During the past 10 years Germany and the rest of Europe have become more
closely integrated. Faced with a (slow recovery) in Germany, the prospects
for the rest of Europe do not look particularly promising.'
The result will be a 'modest and probably erratic period of recovery' this
year.
The state of the German economy is compounded by high interest rates, low
confidence, falling employment and 'restrictive' tax policies which will
continue to hurt demand from European consumers.
Rises in long-term interest rates seen this month could also hinder recovery
unless reversed.
The prospects for France, where a 'sluggish recovery' is under way, are seen
as slightly better than for Germany. But the French trade balance could
deteriorate as a result of falling industrial competitiveness as the franc
remains tied to the D-Mark in the European monetary system.
Italy's improving competitiveness and exports should mean a significant
recovery this year. 'Export growth is leading the upswing, although an end
to destocking will also provide support,' says the report.
Rising exports should also assist Spain, with higher consumer spending
helping.
The forecasts for the UK are optimistic, saying that consumer spending will
continue to grow in spite of higher taxes next month. Across the EU, the
outlook for interest and inflation rates is viewed by the bank as more
promising than for growth.
Inflation will stay just below 1993's 3.4 per cent for the next three years,
says the report, while interest rates are forecast to slip from 7.9 per cent
in 1993 to 5.2 per cent in 1994 and 4.5 per cent for the subsequent two
years.
The scheduled widening of EU membership next January 1 - with the possible
arrival as full members of Sweden, Austria, Norway and Finland  - will
increase the size of the EU by 7 per cent in terms of gross domestic
product.
This 'should give intra-EU trade a one-off boost in 1994 and 1995,' says the
report.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Pay deals below German inflation

<TEXT>
About 1.4m German construction workers will receive 2.4 per cent pay rises
this year, following a deal agreed on Saturday. The award is the biggest so
far this year, but still below forecast inflation of 3 per cent.
The IG Bau union and the industry's two employers' federations have to
approve the deal formally by April 20.
About 500,000 workers with specialist qualifications will receive an extra 3
pfennigs an hour, giving them a total rise of 2.5 per cent.
Negotiations in Frankfurt looked likely to fail because of union demands
that pay for 375,000 construction workers in eastern Germany should match
levels in the west. Under the agreement, eastern pay will reach 90 per cent
of western levels from September 1.
The bulk of pay settlements is now out of the way following earlier deals,
all below inflation, for engineering, chemical, public sector and bank
workers. A pay agreement for about 400,000 print workers is still
outstanding.

FT  28 MAR 94 / New guise for Russia's great survivor: 'World's worst
central banker' is being seen in changed light
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's top banker is a survivor above all else. Mr Victor Gerashchenko,
chairman of the Russian central bank, has seen many efforts to remove him
from his post. They have all failed.
Sacked from the chairmanship of the Soviet State Bank after the August 1991
coup because he took advantage of it to try to impose some discipline over
the bank's republican branches, he was back in office in under two weeks.
Sacked again when the Soviet Union collapsed in December of the same year,
he reappeared as Russian bank chairman by the middle of 1992. He was
appointed, ahead of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier for
finance, by Mr Yegor Gaidar, then the leader of economic reform in the
cabinet.
When Mr Fyodorov took over at the finance, ministry he quickly established
the sourest relations with Mr Gerashchenko, blaming him for pushing up
inflation through giving soft credits to enterprises. Last April, Mr
Fyodorov's pressure was amplified (according to a Russian government
adviser) by a request from President Bill Clinton to President Boris Yeltsin
at the Vancouver summit that Mr Gerashchenko should go. Mr Yeltsin said,
vaguely, he would look into it, and nothing was done.
After another unsuccessful coup in October 1993, Mr Gaidar himself, with Mr
Fyodorov, attempted to persuade Mr Yeltsin to fire Mr Gerashchenko, but he
withstood the pressure. When resignations did take place in January of this
year, it was Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov who left, not Mr Gerashchenko.
Thus the 'world's worst central banker', as Professor Jeffrey Sachs has
called him, survived to have a joke about the nickname with Mr Michel
Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, in Moscow
last week. Mr Camdessus, buoyed by the conditional agreement he had made
with the Russian government to extend it a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn)
loan, complimented the central bank for its commitment to tight monetary
policies, and to reform.
Has Mr Gerashchenko gone from the worst to, if not the best, at least the
good? 'If he has indeed reined in the credits as much as is claimed in the
first quarter, then it is a change,' said a western central banker last
night. 'He has personality and clout,' says Mr Adrian Ball, head of the
Morgan Grenfell office in Moscow. 'He is doing some very useful things, like
persuading commercial banks to become sensible institutions. And he has
always seen the need to keep money circulating.'
Even his detractors say the finance ministry has been as active in printing
money as Mr Gerashchenko, in order to cover government budget deficits. They
admit, too, that the chairman has been between a rock and a hard place -
that is, caught between fuelling inflation and causing bankruptcies and
unemployment.
The case against him is and has always been that, in advancing soft credits,
he has prevented industrial restructuring. Now, however, Mr Camdessus at
least seems satisfied that he is running a credit policy tighter even than
that which the government recommends. But senior officials from the Group of
Seven industrial countries believe there are good reasons of realpolitik for
that.
First, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister and Mr Gerashchenko's
protector against all removal attempts, is now concerned at least to appear
to run a tight policy. Three weeks ago, he berated Mr Gerashchenko in an
enlarged cabinet meeting for downgrading the importance of the fight against
inflation - a clear enough indication that the protection is, if not
removed, conditional.
Mr Chernomyrdin no longer needs Mr Gerashchenko as he did as a counterweight
against the cabinet reformers: now the prime minister must himself struggle
with the imponderables of the Russian economy, and needs an ally against
inflation, not a stoker of it.
Mr Gerashchenko's other great protector, the former Russian supreme soviet,
has also gone. The present parliament has less clear powers over his
appointment and could in any case choose one of their number for the job.
Finally, Mr Gerashchenko has changed the bank, especially by bringing in
some younger people at senior levels (he has a problem to match their pay
with the relatively vast salaries of the commercial banks) and giving them
their head. If he is almost certainly not a convert to tight money, he has
one of the best senses for where power lies in Moscow; and while the man who
runs the government wants to present a monetarist stance to the world, Mr
Gerashchenko will oblige.
'He is a patriot in his way,' says the government adviser. 'He wants the
country to remain great, he wants to re-establish links with the former
Soviet republics to Russia's benefit and he wants to guard against social
explosion. That appeals to Chernomyrdin because he's like that, too.'
Mr Gerashchenko, with the unlikely accolade of the central bankers' central
banker to add to less complimentary ones, is likely to remain part of the
scene for a time yet.

<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, Marseilles soccer boss who is under judicial investigation
in three different cases, showed yesterday that judges had not dented his
popularity, Reuter reports from Paris.
He won 68 per cent of the vote in elections for department councils in
Marseilles and said it was a clear call to run next year for mayor of the
city. Mr Tapie is also running in European parliament elections in June for
the Left Radicals Movement.
A former cabinet minister, he had his parliamentary immunity removed in a
current probe into suspicions of business fraud.
He is also under judicial investigation for bribery and allegedly
interfering with witnesses after players and officials accused his
Marseilles football club of trying to rig a league game last year.
But, as the man who rescued the Marseilles team from decline and took them
to become France's first European champions, Mr Tapie has built a strong
following in the city although the club was stripped of its French league
title and banned from European soccer this season.
Mr Tapie has denounced the allegations as a conspiracy to force him out of
politics.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Balladur hint over youth pay: Local government elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday indicated that he
may be prepared to make concessions on a controversial law which allows
young apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage.
The law, which the government has insisted is necessary to help curb the
rise of youth unemployment, has prompted nationwide demonstrations by
hundreds of thousands of French students who demand that it be withdrawn.
Mr Balladur admitted that the law 'is regarded as displaying a lack of
attention. It is my duty as head of the government to respond to what is an
appeal from the young'.
He stopped short of offering to withdraw the law, but said he would seek to
open a dialogue with youth representatives within the next few days to
discuss possible solutions.
Mr Balladur was speaking at the end of the second and final round of
elections for regional councils, which confirmed the dominant position of
his centre-right coalition in local government, but which also brought gains
for the opposition Socialist party.
The ruling RPR-UDF coalition lost 10 seats but still took 52 per cent of the
vote, while the socialists and their allies gained seven seats with 36.6 per
cent support, according to the Interior Ministry.
The communists secured 7.7 per cent of the final vote, the extreme right
National Front 2.6 per cent and the ecologists less than 0.5 per cent.
There was a 58.7 per cent voter turnout, against 60 per cent in last week's
first round vote.
In the first round, the RPR-UDF coalition won 44.7 per cent of the vote and
the socialists 28.7 per cent.
Mr Balladur described the results as a vote of confidence in the government
and RPR-UDF coalition.
Mr Michel Rocard, the socialist leader, said the results were very
satisfying and demonstrated the recovery of the party since last year's
general election.
The local elections were the first nationwide vote since the general
election and were regarded as an important test for Mr Balladur's
government. The prime minister has seen his personal popularity decline
steadily since the beginning of the year and his approval rating now stands
at below 50 per cent.
Yesterday's elections concerned the 1,372 council seats in which there was
no outright winner in the first round of voting.
The 95 conseils generals are an important part of France's structure of
local govern-ment. Their responsibilities include the management and
development of public services, such as transport and healthcare, outside
urban areas.

FRANCE
The French press is preoccupied with upheaval - both on the streets of the
nation's cities and, closer to home, in the newspaper industry itself.
The wave of student demonstrations, which has brought tens of thousands on
to the streets in protest at a new law allowing young apprentices to be paid
less than the minimum wage, has prompted a bout of soul-searching about the
state of society and the potential for an explosion of social unrest.
'Are we experiencing a return to 1968?' asked Le Figaro in an editorial,
posing the question of the moment.
For most of the press, the answer is No, or at least not yet. But there is
high anxiety nonetheless. 'The young are angry,' proclaims the front cover
of Le Point magazine. Le Monde writes of 'a blocked society', while Ouest
France, one of the largest regional papers, describes a dangerous divorce
between politicians and the French people.
There has also been much soul-searching over the future of the press itself.
Falling readership, the impact of new publications, and changes in
management and ownership have prompted newspapers to reconsider their
strategies.
Last week the right-wing Quotidien de Paris launched a redesign which
affected both presentation and editorial content. Photographs sprung on to
the front page and long opinion pieces took a back seat to punchier news
items. 'There will be no more grandstanding or pages of debate, because I
think people don't read them any more,' said Mr Philippe Tesson, manager of
the newspaper.
Most significantly, however, the newly-named Quotidien cut its price from
FFr6 (Pounds 0.68) to FFr4 (Pounds 0.45). The move, partly in response to
January's launch of Infomatin, the small-format morning paper priced
aggressively at FFr3, reflects the emergence of a circulation war in the
recession-hit industry.
The turmoil has extended to the loftiest titles. Le Monde, a bastion of the
traditional French press, is also reviewing its strategy. 'To be passive is
to be beaten,' wrote Mr Jean-Marie Colombani, the newspaper's managing
editor, quoting President de Gaulle.
Mr Colombani, who took over the top editorial job earlier this month after
the surprise resignation of Mr Jacques Lesourne, has spelled out a policy of
change. 'The idea of a more compact paper, from Monday to Friday, and a
thicker weekend edition, in the Anglo-Saxon way, has been raised. But we
must also take account of the pricing strategy,' he said in an interview
with the left-wing daily, Liberation.
As with the student demonstrations, the common element behind the
manoeuvrings in the newspaper industry can be traced to the economic
environment. Estimates suggest advertising revenues for the national press
have fallen by almost 30 per cent in the past two years and are set to
decline by 10 per cent this year. The trend, partly the result of a reform
of the media buying system under the previous Socialist government, has been
compounded by falling sales resulting from depressed consumer spend-ing.
In many cases the result has been an urgent search for new partners. Earlier
this year the Expansion group was rescued by CEP, an investment consortium.
Infomatin, which has seen its sales slip following a successful launch, is
believed to be seeking additional backers.
Amid the turmoil, however, there is also stability - particularly in
editorial opinion. Le Figaro, which has been closer than its rivals to the
centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, has been relatively
supportive of the prime minister's actions in the face of the student
demonstrations.
'One must always be wary of popular anger or public opinion,' wrote Mr
Franz-Olivier Giesbert in a front page editorial on Saturday. 'It is urgent
that France accepts a certain number of reforms, in employment, social
security and national education.'
Not surprisingly, Liberation sees it differently. 'The only intelligent
decision which could be taken today by the prime minister would be to
withdraw the decree implementing the CIP,' it said, referring to the
apprentice contract at the centre of the student storm.
It concludes, however, that such a measure is unlikely, given its importance
to Mr Balladur's credibility. Upheaval on the streets, and in the press, is
likely to continue.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Opec's heavyweight controls the ring: How the Saudis foiled
a move to cut production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One member, one vote is the rule within the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. But if there is a difference of opinion it helps to
have the world's largest oil reserves and a third of Opec's total production
on your side.
On Saturday night Saudi Arabia proved again that the cartel can act only
with Riyadh's active co-operation. Its decision not to take part in a
proposed production cut to bolster weak prices put paid to a scheme being
promoted by many of its Opec colleagues. And it was made in spite of dire
warnings from the secretariat that such a course could trigger a further
collapse in the price.
The Opec communique stressed the group's unanimous agreement to adhere to
the extension to the end of the year of the present 24.52m barrel a day
production ceiling. But the rhetoric did little to hide the dissatisfaction
of some member states, all of which are struggling to cope with a fall of
more than 20 per cent in oil prices over the past year.
'There was a possibility of a very substantial achievement and success which
we let slip through our hands,' said Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil
minister. He noted that Iran, one of Opec's most populous and poorer states,
had lost Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.39bn) in oil revenues in the six months
since the organisation's decision to set the present production ceiling.
But Tehran's suggestion of a 1.4m b/d cut did not even make it to the formal
proposal stage.
Nigeria, another poor and populous member, did manage to present formally a
complex proposal for a 6 per cent cut. But it died a quick death before a
final meeting confined to the 12 oil ministers.
A similar fate was in store for an Indonesian plan to cut to 23.5m b/d the
ceiling set last March, which was rarely respected because of widespread
quota cheating by some Opec members.
There was no need to propose the rollover, according to Mr Subroto, Opec
secretary-general, because there was no other option left. The only issue
was its duration.
An Opec official said the line taken by Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil
minister, was simple: 'If you think a cut is the best way forward, then go
ahead.' But Saudi Arabia was not about to be easily moved off its 8m b/d
quota, say analysts, and without Saudi participation there could be no
reduction that would be credible to world oil markets.
Riyadh's reluctance to lower output may appear counter-productive at a time
when it, too, is under severe financial strain because of falling oil
revenues. But Saudi Arabia has been equally reluctant to have its policy
dictated by the short-term volatility of oil markets.
It also harbours doubts about the effectiveness of even a large production
cut. The country has steadfastly adhered to its quota, but it fears other
Opec states would take advantage of any price rise that a cut might trigger
by cheating on theirs.
In addition, Saudi Arabia was the only Opec member to agree to a reduced
quota at the beginning of last year and it, along with the United Arab
Emirates, did not take part in last September's round of quota increases.
The possibility that non-Opec producers such as Britain and Norway would
make up for any shortfall that an Opec cut might create was another factor
in Saudi thinking.
So, too, was the belief that demand will improve significantly in the second
half of the year. It is a view shared by many analysts.
'There could be a sudden increase in price by the fourth quarter,' according
to Mr Leonidas Drollas, economist at London's Centre for Global Energy
Studies. He believes that by then, the Opec basket, the average price of
seven crude oils, could rise by about Dollars 2 to Dollars 15.
Analysts were also generally positive about the length of the rollover. Mr
Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst with the International Petroleum Finance Company
in Washington, said 'refiners should be more eager to buy if they know there
is no more Opec production coming in the fourth quarter', when Opec's output
tends to rise to meet high winter demand.
Saudi Arabia also controls most of the excess oil production capacity in the
world, so it would not be easy for other Opec or non-Opec producers to take
advantage of any price rises later in the year.
The Saudis also have the financial means to cushion the short-term price
falls which Opec ministers concede are likely to accompany the current
strategy. It is less certain whether their less well-off colleagues can
stand the pain which the next six months may bring.

<TEXT>
The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, accused Moslems yesterday of
having launched a new military offensive. He warned them to stop it or risk
losing territory they might have recovered by negotiations, Reuter reports
from Belgrade.
Mr Karadzic told a meeting of his Serbian Democratic party, in the Bosnian
Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, a big spring offensive, which he claimed had
already begun, must be broken.
'If the Moslems continue this, I will order a counter-offensive and then
they will not be able to get territory they might get through political
negotiations,' he was quoted by Tanjug news agency as saying. 'There is no
way anyway that they can get territory on which they are now killing our
people,' he added.
The Bosnian government-controlled radio has reported that the Moslem-led
government army has recaptured some territory from the Serbs around Tesanj
and Teslik in north-central Bosnia. UN officials in Sarajevo said on
Saturday there was heavy fighting in the area, but could not confirm reports
of Bosnian gains.
Government and Croatian forces are no longer fighting each other after
agreement to form a Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation, but the Serbs have
refused to join it.

More than 60 per cent of Ukraine's electorate had voted four hours before
the polls closed yesterday, surpassing the required 50 per cent threshold in
the nation's first post-Soviet parliamentary elections.
Voter turnout became a key issue in the campaign, after presidential aides
predicted that apathy would make it impossible to elect a workable
legislature, enabling President Leonid Kravchuk to introduce direct
presidential rule and cancel June presidential elections.
Most of the nation's 450 parliamentary districts are expected to go to a
second round on April 10 because an outright majority is needed to win a
seat.
Voters in the restive eastern regions came out in large numbers, although it
was not clear if they would vote for parliamentary candidates or only cast
their ballots in local 'opinion polls' calling for closer links with Russia.
The most potentially incendiary of these local referendums was held in the
Russian-dominated Crimean peninsula, which went ahead with a poll on
independence, despite warnings from Kiev that the Ukrainian government
considered the referendum illegal. A strong vote for independence in Crimea,
which many Russians consider to be a natural part of their state, could
further complicate already tense relations between Ukraine and Russia.
An official in Simferopol, the Crimean capital, was confident that the 50
per cent threshold had been exceeded in the local referendum.
Meanwhile, in Kiev, the elections could play a key role in determining the
outcome of a mounting power struggle between the president and parliament.
Over the weekend Mr Kravchuk, speaking on national television, said that if
the parliament was 'not full-blooded' - less than a full 450-seat house - he
would ask the legislature 'to give the president new legislative powers' and
cancel presidential elections 'so as not to create a vacuum of power'.
But, as he cast his ballot yesterday morning, Mr Ivan Pliushch, parliament's
chairman, struck back. He rejected postponement of the presidential ballot
and said he was confident the parliamentary elections would produce a
working legislature.
Most voters seemed oblivious to battles between their leaders and used
simpler criteria when choosing whom to support. 'I guess I'll vote for the
youngest,' said Mr Andrii Voronko, a 29-year-old electrical engineer, who
confessed that he was confused by his ballot paper full of unfamiliar names
and birth dates. 'They (the younger politicians) have the energy and aren't
screwed up by the old mentality.'
For a retired publisher, local politics took precedence over national
debates. He decided to vote for an former Soviet bureaucrat who had helped
him to get a flat years ago.

President Boris Yeltsin arrived home yesterday after a Black Sea holiday
that provoked a rash of rumours about coup plots and his failing health, AP
reports from Moscow. In an interview published in the newspaper Izvestia on
Saturday he condemned what he called the 'rich brew of lies, meanness and
greed'. Even his normally reticent wife, Naina, was quoted in the press.
Mr Yeltsin's two-week absence from the capital provided a field day for
speculation about everything from the president's bad back and his heart to
his drinking habits and his liver. Aides were forced to issue frequent
denials that Mr Yeltsin was at death's door.

FT  28 MAR 94 / French airline sets deadline for its unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Air France's 14 trade unions have until Thursday to agree to a restructuring
plan aimed at curbing losses at the French state-owned airline, the company
said yesterday.
The statement followed protracted negotiations at the weekend between the
unions and Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France.
Mr Blanc has insisted on staff support for his recovery plan, which is a
condition of a capital injection of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) from the French
government. He has said he will appeal directly to the company's 40,000
employees if any of the unions refuse to agree to the restructuring.
The communist-led CGT walked out of the negotiations, which started on
Saturday morning and lasted until 5am yesterday. A spokesman for the union
said it opposed elements of the plan, including an increase in working hours
from 38 to 39 hours per week for ground staff and the implementation of
5,000 job cuts.
The CGT said it was seeking further negotiations and would consult its
members to decide a final position before a meeting with other union groups
on Thursday.
The airline's other unions declined to comment yesterday on the progress of
negotiations. But Force Ouvriere, the largest union at Air France, has
previously indicated support for the rescue plan.
Union opposition and a series of violent strikes forced the withdrawal of a
previous recovery plan last October and the resignation of Mr Bernard
Attali, then chairman. The episode represented a serious blow to the
centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which was forced into a
damaging climbdown.
In addition to voluntary job cuts, Mr Blanc's plan includes a three-year
wage freeze and a reduction in the airline's fleet from 166 aircraft to 149
over the next five years. Air France says that the measures are vital to
stem losses estimated at FFr7.5bn last year and to win European Union
approval for the capital increase from the French state.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Revolt by key party shakes Swedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The minority coalition government in Sweden has been shaken by uproar in the
small right-wing party that holds the balance of power, just as Prime
Minister Carl Bildt is preparing to fight a general election in September.
The New Democracy party late last week declared it would no longer act as
'the fifth wheel' under the four-party coalition of the right and centre led
by Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party. This role has underpinned the
government since it took office in late-1991.
The New Democrats said they would join the main opposition Social Democratic
party and the small Left party in voting next month to abolish a
controversial healthcare reform at the centre of Mr Bildt's attempt to
streamline and liberalise Sweden's welfare system. Together, the three
parties could defeat the government in parliament.
With less than three months to go until parliament is dissolved before the
election, a change of government is not being discussed. A deep split in New
Democracy, whose leader Mr Ian Wachtmeister announced his resignation a few
weeks ago, has left in doubt the willingness of all its parliamentary
members to follow the new party line.
Mr Bildt's room for manoeuvre has been narrowed, particularly over
healthcare reform. A move now being implemented, to let Swedish family
doctors set up private practices outside direct local authority control, and
to let Swedes choose their family doctors, could be stopped next month. The
momentum of Mr Bildt's efforts to break down welfare state monopolies and
introduce more competition seems likely to be halted.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Coalition's grip grows tighter: Local government elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's governing centre-right coalition last night appeared set to
strengthen its grip on local government following the second and final round
of voting in regional council elections.
After a strong showing in the first round on March 20, the RPR-UDF coalition
headed by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, was well placed yesterday
to win control of up to eight departments, adding to the 75 of France's 95
departments it already held. The opposition Socialist party, which suffered
a crushing defeat in last year's general elections, was well placed to win
four more departments.
A strong performance is important for Mr Balladur, who has seen his personal
popularity decline steadily since the beginning of the year and who is
currently confronted by a powerful challenge from the country's student
movement. Tens of thousands of students have taken over to the streets over
the past few weeks to protest against a law which allows young apprentices
to be paid less than the minimum wage.
A survey published yesterday by the BVA polling institute found 64 per cent
of voters wanted the law repealed. But analysts said the issue might not
have a big impact on the regional elections.
These elections, which represented the first significant test of the
government's support since it took office in March last year, concerned the
1,372 districts in which there was no outright winner in the first round.
The seats involved were last contested in 1988, when the Socialist party
recorded strong gains.
The 95 conseils generals are an important part of France's structure of
local government. Their responsibilities include the management and
development of public services, such as transport and health care, outside
urban areas.
In the first round of the regional elections, the RPR-UDF coalition won 44.7
per cent of the vote, compared with 28.7 per cent for the Socialists. The
extreme right National Front won about 10 per cent of the vote, with the
ecologists suffering a sharp fall in support to just over 2 per cent.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Oil price collapse warning as Opec maintains output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil markets will give their verdict today on Opec's decision at the weekend
not to cut output despite warnings that failure to do so could trigger a
further price collapse.
Delegates from the 12 member states of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries conceded that the decision to extend the present
production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day for the remainder of the year
could lead to lower prices, especially in the next three months,
traditionally the weakest period for oil demand.
But they brushed aside warnings by Opec's secretariat at their Geneva
meeting that prices could fall to single digits unless a cut of 1m barrels a
day or more was made. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend closed at
Dollars 13.91 a barrel on Friday. The ministers justified their decision by
citing forecasts indicating that much higher demand will materialise by the
end of the year.
Analysts generally welcomed the rollover of the ceiling. They said Opec's
decision to suspend the practice of setting quarterly supply levels in
favour of the nine-month ceiling removed uncertainty from the market. Most
also agreed that demand could be sharply higher in the fourth quarter.
'The market needs a cut to push prices up,' said Mr Mohammed Abduljabbar,
economist with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company. An Opec
official, however, described it as 'damage control'.
An attempt to orchestrate a co-ordinated cut with eight non-Opec producers
collapsed when Saudi Arabia, Opec's dominant member accounting for a third
of total output, refused to participate.
Saudi Arabia is reluctant to accept any reduction in its 8m barrels a day
quota, citing the fact that it agreed to a freeze at that level last year
when most other Opec quotas were raised. It also feared that any price gain
from a sizeable cut could be eroded by some Opec members cheating on their
quota, a perennial issue within the organisation.
Officials say Opec ministers now realise that the present pricing policy
based on supply management is insufficient. A study of various options,
including the possible adoption of fixed or minimum prices, is to be
presented at Opec's June meeting.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Downing Street moves to quell Tory anxieties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downing Street moved last night to counter suggestions that Britain had
capitulated in the row over EU voting rights by cautioning that the
government would not automatically accept the proposed deal.
Signalling the start of a concerted two-day push to swing the main body of
the Conservative party behind the proposed compromise, it said no decision
would be taken until after a full meeting of the cabinet tomorrow.
This would examine in detail whether or not the proposals met the concerns
of Mr John Major, the prime minister. According to one senior official:
'There is still a fair bit of work to be done.'
With Tory business managers due to meet this morning, a crucial
consideration will be how the proposals are received not by the Eurosceptic
hardcore - who would oppose almost any compromise - but by the broad mass of
Tory backbenchers.
The support of all but the hardcore is essential for Mr Major, who is
anxious not to widen the rift in the party over Europe in the run-up to
local government and European elections which could have an important
bearing on his future as leader.
Interviewed yesterday on BBC Radio 4 after the compromise was put forward,
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said he had 'agreed to nothing' while
emphasising that the other countries had made a 'serious move' in Britain's
direction.
'You are never going to get 100 per cent of what you want, the question is
whether we can achieve the enlargement of the Community and provide
sufficient protection of our interests. We have to decide how our interests
and those of the minority can be protected,' he said.
Noting some countries were worried the proposals went too far in Britain's
direction, Mr Hurd said ministers would have to consider 'very soberly'
whether they went far enough.
Leading Eurosceptics yesterday joined Labour in criticising the government's
handling of the negotiations.
Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford, said he was 'deeply disturbed by the
trend'. Labour said Mr Hurd's 'climbdown' was 'humiliating but predictable'.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Fyodorov attacks Russia's Dollars 1.5bn deal with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former Russian deputy prime minister in charge of
finance, today launches an attack on the agreement reached last week by the
International Monetary Fund to provide a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan to
Russia.
Mr Fyodorov, who resigned in January in protest at what he called 'the end
of reform', writes in today's Financial Times that Russian policies will
change 'in the wrong direction' once the loan is provided.
'Western taxpayers have a right to know to what end their money is being
spent when they have problems of their own back home,' he says. 'The Dollars
1.5bn is immaterial to Russia given the scale of its problems and would be
eaten up in a matter of minutes.'
Mr Fyodorov, now a leading deputy in the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, said Russian and western experts who claim that Russia is
'special', and that therefore reforms must be introduced slowly, should try
to live in Russia on a Russian salary for two years.
He says that, before any money is paid, the budget should be passed through
parliament and the government's record on low inflation established. 'There
is no valid reason to hurry before being reasonably sure that this
government's new virtue is real.'
Mr Fyodorov's scepticism was supported by Mr Mikhail Sarafanov, director of
the National Market Research Institute of the Ministry of Trade, a leading
pro-free-trade think-tank. He suggests that the IMF loan was at least 75 per
cent political and that there is no possibility the government can stay
within the bounds of the budget.
The loan, the second tranche of the Dollars 3bn 'systemic transformation
facility', intended to aid the restructuring of the Russian economy, will be
recommended by Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, if the government
presents a list of laws and decrees to the parliament. The government must
aim to increase budget income, while retaining expenditure at the present
level.
Mr Camdessus, who expected IMF approval by the end of April or the beginning
of May, placed great store on the relationship of trust he developed in his
five-day Moscow visit with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister.
Mr Chernomyrdin's ministers, however, are already rebelling. Mr Alexander
Shokhin, promoted last week to be deputy minister for the economy, said on
Friday that a continued squeeze on credits would cripple the economy.

FT  28 MAR 94 / UK isolated as Spain agrees EU vote compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IOANNINA, GREECE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK found itself isolated and under intense pressure last night to accept
a compromise over reforms to European Union voting procedures as Spain
signalled it was ready to accept a deal.
After two days of talks in Greece, Britain was faced with a proposal that
falls well short of its demands and leaves the planned enlargement of the EU
on a knife-edge.
The UK government will now decide at a cabinet meeting tomorrow how to react
to the compromise, arranged by the Greek presidency. EU foreign ministers
said they wanted to complete a deal by 6pm tomorrow.
The UK met immovable opposition over its requests to maintain a threshold of
23 votes as the blocking minority after the admission of Finland, Sweden,
Austria and Norway into the Union next year.
Spain, which had also resisted voting reforms, and Britain are being offered
a 'reasonable' delay on decisions that are opposed by countries mustering
between 23 and 27 votes, the proposed new threshold to block legislation.
During this period, the European Commission and the presidency will be
obliged to seek a consensus, 'always respecting the rules of procedure',
according to the text.
Senior Union officials said this language expressly excludes an open-ended
discussion. British demands for an indefinite delay on controversial
decisions also ran into strong resistance.
Current rules would still apply whereby one member state can call for a vote
on controversial legislation, on the basis of a simple majority.
The proposed deal attempts to strike a delicate balance. It recognises the
need to protect large countries from being outvoted easily in an expanded
Union. But it tilts decisively against introducing rules which could
paralyse decision-making.
The deal does not meet UK demands for legally-binding guarantees preserving
the power of two large states to join with one small country to block
decisions in the Council of Ministers.
The latest twist in the power-sharing dispute confronts Mr John Major, the
prime minister, with an acute dilemma.
Either Mr Major accepts an offer which could trigger a revolt among Tory
Euro-sceptics, or he rejects the compromise and risks bearing sole
responsibility for delaying enlargement, which has long been supported by
the British government.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said 'serious work' had been
accomplished over the weekend, but he declined to predict the outcome of the
cabinet meeting.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, echoing comments
from other EU foreign ministers, suggested Britain had received the best
terms available. Without agreement on voting rights this week, he forecast
'an absolute crisis' in the EU.
Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, spoke of a 'breakthrough', but
Mr Hurd was more cautious. He said the UK's partners now accepted that the
relationship between the size of member states and their votes could not be
brushed under the carpet. This issue had to be tackled 'root and branch' at
the 1996 conference to review the Maastricht treaty, said Mr Hurd.
Although Britain's position will be crucial, other countries voiced some
reservations about the deal, raising the danger of amendments later this
week which could delay settlement.

FT  28 MAR 94 / Italy goes to polls under new system
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Achille Occhetto, leader of the seven-party Progressive Alliance, signals
his hopes for victory in the Italian general election which began yesterday.
Italy's 48m voters have started two days of polling in what is seen as the
country's most unpredictable general election since democracy was restored
after the second world war. The election marks the formal end of the postwar
dominance of Italian politics by the Christian Democrats and their allies.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. Arnie writes:
Although Lucy prefers Margaritas and soul to gluhwein and yodelling, Austria
feels like home after 2 1/2 months in the US.
Apart from some wintry weather in Soll and Westendorf, where we skied in a
couple of blizzards, the skiing has been blissfully warm and the scenery
superb.  The hills and mountains of the Tyrol are alive with the sounds and
smells of spring.
Skiing in low resorts such as Kolsass, Weer and Igls is all but over, but
the snow is still good in Obergurgl, Mayrhofen and Axamer Lizum.
And in Alpbach we enjoyed a near-perfect day.

<TEXT>
Black pepper prices were again firmer because of the limited availability,
reports Man Producten. The harvest is almost over in India and Brazil and
Indonesia have not been eager sellers. White pepper prices also remained
steady, although demand for nearby positions was slow. Buying interest for
new crop positions was picking up in Europe, however. Muntok/Sarawak faq was
quoted at USDollars 2,900 a tonne for spot supplies, with March-April
shipment at Dollars 2,875 and July-August at Dollars 2,700. Nutmeg prices
were firmer on the local market in Indonesia, where carryover stocks are
smaller than usual and estimates of the new production low. Grenada
certainly will not spoil the market, so there is room for firmer prices
again. Cassia was still weak, as were pimentos and cloves.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Gummer to decide on stadium plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunderland Football Club's plans for a Pounds 75m superstadium and
entertainment centre on land beside Nissan's Pounds 900m car plant have been
called in for a decision by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
A public inquiry into the club's proposals, which have been strongly opposed
by Nissan, is now virtually certain.
Earlier this month Sunderland City Council's environment committee decided
not to refuse outline planning permission.
But the environment department said yesterday Mr Gummer believed he should
decide on the application because of its conflict with the council's
approved development plan and its likely implications for the green belt,
highway safety and neighbouring land uses.
Nissan fears the development will block future expansion and jeopardise
production methods.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Opec divisions over production cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday failed in its
first attempt at its Geneva meeting to orchestrate a production cut to
bolster weak prices. The ministers will try again today.
An Opec official last night said cuts of 4-6 per cent were being considered,
with the possibility of according special treatment for three members which
had shown restraint in September when Opec last raised its output ceiling,
to 24.52m barrels a day.
The three are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, some of
Opec's largest producers.
Delegates later denied there was a specific plan and one indicated that
enthusiasm for cuts was mainly confined to smaller producers.
Another delegate noted that even a cut of as much as 1m b/d would not be
credible if it triggered a new round of quota cheating, Opec's perennial
problem.
'A nominal cut of 1m b/d could turn out to be an actual cut of only 600,000
b/d,' he warned. 'A meaningful cut is one that is adhered to.'
Earlier, ministers tried to gauge the level of support from sympathetic
independent producers for a co-ordinated worldwide cut. They were told that
eight countries - Russia, Oman, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Brunei, Malaysia and
Colombia - had agreed to make cumulative cuts of 200,000-250,000 b/d.

Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former West Australian premier and a newcomer to

portfolio and a seat in cabinet in the fourth reshuffle undertaken by Mr
Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, in as many months, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
The decision to combine human services with the health job means that Mr
Brian Howe, the deputy prime minister, loses these responsibilities but
becomes minister for housing and regional development - picking up the
regional job from industry minister Peter Cook.
Mr Cook, in turn, takes on responsibilities for science. Mr John Faulkner
becomes minister for the environment, sport and territories.

Poland's two-month search for a finance minister hit further delays
yesterday when President Lech Walesa refused to accept Mr Dariusz Rosati for
the post, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Rosati, an economist
working for the UN in Geneva, had been proposed by the social democratic
SLD, the larger of the two governing coalition parties. His name was
grudgingly put to Mr Walesa for formal approval by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the
prime minister and the PSL farmers' party leader, yesterday after heavy
pressure from the SLD, which was handed the finance portfolio in the
coalition deal agreed between the two parties last autumn.
By blocking the candidature President Walesa is in effect backing Mr Pawlak,
who is fighting to win more control over financial policies and has been
unhappy with Mr Rosati.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Exports of toxic waste to be banned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All exports of hazardous wastes from rich countries to poor ones will be
outlawed from the end of 1997, the 64 members of the United Nations toxic
waste convention decided yesterday. Exports of toxic waste destined for
final disposal rather than recycling will be prohibited immediately.
The ban was greeted with jubilation by environmental groups and developing
countries which have waged a vigorous campaign to halt toxic waste dumping
in the third world and, increasingly, in eastern Europe.
Greenpeace hailed the decision, which was taken by consensus, as 'a striking
victory for global environmental justice'. Mr Chris Lamb, who chaired the
week-long conference of the parties to the Basle convention on transboundary
movement of hazardous wastes, said the international community had taken 'an
historic step'.
The turning point came on Thursday when European Union ministers in Brussels
decided to support the ban from end-1997. This brought into line two strong
opponents of an outright prohibition, Britain and Germany, the world's
biggest toxic waste exporter.
Other dissenters, Australia, Canada and Japan, were then isolated. The
United States, which also opposes a ban, is not a member of the convention
and is not bound by yesterday's decision.
According to the UN Environment Programme, over 400m tonnes of hazardous
wastes are produced each year, 98 per cent of this by the industrialised
countries. OECD nations export 10-12m tonnes of toxic waste each year to the
third world.
The Basle convention, which came into force in May 1992, regulates
transboundary movement and disposal of toxic wastes.
A committee of the 1975 UN convention on international trade in endangered
species (Cites) has decided not to recommend trade sanctions against China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, despite evidence that continued use of
tiger bone and rhino horn for traditional medicines is bringing the
protected species close to extinction.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Bonds fall further on rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds continued their steep decline yesterday as fears of
rising interest rates intensified.
Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at SG Warburg, said the gilt
market was discounting base rates of 6 per cent by the end of 1994 and 7 1/2
per cent by the end of 1995. The rate is now 5 1/4 per cent.
In New York, blue-chip share prices plunged for a second consecutive day as
the yield on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond topped 7.0 per cent at
7.009 for the first time in 10 months. Traders could not identify a single
cause for the continuing sell-off in bonds, but cited domestic and
international political concerns and the upward movement in interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 46.36 down at 3,774.73 after
closing 48 points lower in the previous session.
In UK gilts, most of the activity was in the futures market where the June
contract of the long gilt future fell as low as 105 1/8 , but later
recovered to just under 1 point down at 106 1/16 .
The yield on long-dated giltscame close to 8 per cent at one point
yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 index, meanwhile, recouped an early loss of 33 points to close
7.3 points higher at 3,129. Continental bourses also recovered part of their
early losses.
The dollar and sterling came under heavy selling pressure in London, but
finished above their worst.
The US currency closed at DM1.668, off a low of DM1.6595, but down from
Thursday's close of DM1.6726. The pound recov ered from a low of DM2.4880 to
finish the day at DM2.4978, slightly above Thursday's close of DM2.4971.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A can of air and some pebbles, please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People often send me things. Items of leisure clothing. Baskets of tropical
fruit. Commemoration puddings. Aluminium place mats. Atlases and guidebooks.
Blue and red balloons. Golf balls and sweatbands. Tickets to the opera.
Glassware and standing clocks.
I do not keep any of this product. It is passed on to colleagues' children,
such as Rhys James, a magpie-child from Essex. Or it is donated to the
annual raffle for charity organised, bossily, by elements on the foreign
desk.
On a good day, when things are going well, I pass this product on speedily
to its next destination. But on a bad day - colleagues proving bothersome,
testing my mettle - my eye sometimes settles ungenerously on the latest gift
or object to have arrived upon my desk.
It happened this week. An irksomely tiring day. My patience fully exhausted.
I had almost reached the point of screen-faxing a significantly rude message
to someone (the Malaysian ambassador, most probably) when my eye alighted on
a press release sent to me, impertinently, by a person called Chris Horwood
from an outfit dubbed M S Marketing &amp; Management (MSM&amp;M) on behalf of a new
product named O-PUR.
At the sight of this press release I flew into a temper. At the end of a bad
day, unsolicited press releases written by people for whom English appears
to be a second or optional language have that effect on me. The phrase that
sent me reeling may sound innocuous, but it assaulted my tired brain with
the force of an ice-pick. This was the phrase: 'The finest oxygen.'
Now then. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know that oxygen is an
element. Nor do you have to be a rocket scientist or a pioneer of cold
fusion to guess that by sending out a press release which implies that your
type of oxygen is finer than somebody else's oxygen is - oxymoronic:
calculated, without doubt, to send some snotty journalist, at the end of a
bad day, into the sort of tantrum in which he rolls on the floor, ululating
horribly and attempting to stab, with a pair of Sheffield-sharpened
scissors, anyone who approaches him. This is not good for your product. It
is not good marketing. The textbooks are clear on this point.
As it happens, O-PUR is about the stupidest new product I have ever
encountered. It is an aerosol manufactured by Newpharm in Switzerland and
filled with 'eight litres of 99 per cent pure oxygen' which is stored as a
vaporised gas and contains 'no expellant, additives, preserving agents or
aromas, just pure unadulterated oxygen'.
O-PUR is designed to embellish our lifestyles, to revitalise us in office or
in gym. The canister comes with a cheap plastic attachment that is supposed
to act like a face-mask.
According to MSM&amp;M's dreadful press release: 'The O-PUR marketing strategy
will only target potential purchasers in the personal fitness/health, sports
aids, and air quality/pollution concerns market places.' Price: a colossal
Pounds 7.99 per can. 'To conform to the British Medicine Controls Agencies
guidelines it must be pointed out, and there is a note on all promotional
materials, that O-PUR is not, and should not be used as, a medicinal or life
saving device; nor is it a substitute for prescribed oxygen.'
In a letter from the Chris Horwood person, MSM&amp;M claims that the 'O-PUR
bandwagon is about to roll'. Many people may scoff, it says, but they are
'probably the same individuals that laughed at the idea of bottled water
sales. I think you will agree that most people have far more realistic
worries about their own atmospheric environment, than by what comes out of
their taps.'
I will be amazed if O-PUR succeeds at that - or any - price. But perhaps it
is a sign of the way things are headed. As the population of the world spins
past 7bn, 10bn, 15bn, 25bn - perhaps even higher - I have little doubt that
marketing people, almost all of whom are directly descended from Attila the
Hun and other pillagers, will rack their brains to sell us more and more
things that used to be freely ours.
Not just oxygen and water, but little patches of grass. Flowers from the
hedgerow. Birdsong. Sunlight. Moonlight. Starlight. Stones. Pebbles. Rain.
Snow. Sleet. Wind. Hot. Cold. Light. Dark.
Even our own reflections, I shouldn't be surprised.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Thank goodness for metal detectors: Michael Harrison defends
freelance treasure hunters on motor cycles against the archaeology
profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is another side to the views expressed in Antony Thorncroft's article
last Saturday ('Greedy for Antiquities', March 19). I agree that illegal
digging must be condemned and would never support the activity of
unscrupulous dealers.
However, the use of metal detectors has greatly increased the number of
chance finds on sites of no archaeological significance, such as trackways
or byways were few. Normal archaeological methods would have been unlikely
ever to have unearthed them. Many of these finds were lost accidentally or
discarded as damaged, and archaeologists are able to deduce that many groups
of artefacts previously believed very rare were in fact fairly common.
Before the era of metal detectors most of us believed that we lived on sites
which may have been continuously occupied for perhaps many centuries, or
that we might live over as yet undiscovered sites. Today the surface of this
country is fast becoming ploughed up and destroyed by contractors' earth
moving equipment and more and more of us live on a spoil heap of junk or in
a hole from which the imprint of our ancestors let alone the lie of the land
has been obliterated.
Thank goodness that metal detectorists on motor cycles follow the dumper
trucks about the country and recover from their scrambled contents what they
can. We cannot turn back the clock as regards contractors or metal detectors
however much we would wish.
As Thorncroft says, the old treasure trove law was interested in precious
metal, usually for its melt value.
Today, academic rather than monetary value, is surely more important. Yet in
the discussion of how finds should be treated and arguments about who has
the 'right' to ownership, this all-important aspect is overlooked.
Surely that right rests with the landowner and to some extent with the
finder, even if the archaeologist might claim a legitimate right of study. I
suspect that the heart of the archaeologist's complaints are often that he
is jealous of those who can sell and buy things for high prices; but this is
no part of his academic duty.
I find many archaeologists ignore this divide between ownership and the need
for study.
In a greedy attempt to corner everything that lies beneath the soil for
selfish professional reasons, they assume that only they are sufficiently
qualified and educated to hold these things in their hands and to have
access to them. This is a half-baked Marxist notion and directly contrary to
the important freedoms established in this country's common law.
Some of these second rate academics attend conferences in which they express
an arrogant determination to drive dealing out, to make it a crime, and
presumably, it follows, to blight private collections by depriving them of
free marketability.
So far their efforts within the EC have meant only that leading dealers are
all busily establishing businesses in Switzerland so that they may sell
direct to the big markets in the US, Japan and Australia. Yet another blow
has been struck at the heart of London as the arts centre of the world.
It seems to me, leaving aside the inequality that would result in giving too
much influence to a minority group, that such restrictions on the rest of us
(who may in the case of several people I know be better informed than
certain archaeologists) are an unnecessarily high price to pay merely to
allow a few archaeologists to increase their knowledge to the optimum.
I do not argue against adding to our knowledge, just that it is a barmy
notion that objects jettisoned by their original owner as beyond repair, or
buried by chance, and after surviving many centuries of treasure seekers,
unobservant ploughmen and ignorant superstition should now in the late 20th
century all have to be confiscated and reburied in reserve collections to
satisfy the bead-counting mentality and overweening self importance of a
small group of fanatics.
Perhaps art gallery curators would then follow up by confiscating all
paintings in private possession. It should then not be long before the civil
servants can be persuaded to extend this droit d'elite even unto the least
of Victorian kitchen chairs.
In short, the underground market will only be brought out into the open by
separating absolute title to an object from the obligation to make it
available for academic research.
All parties will then benefit.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Private View: Gypsy president in a pin-striped suit - Peter
Mercer has an office, mobile telephone, computer and fax. And most of his
travelling is by air. Such is the life of a modern-day campaigner for the
rights of the nomadic community
</HEADLINE>

The president of the Gypsy Council was wearing a pin-striped suit. He keeps
a mobile phone in the mustard-coloured trailer with the mock-Tudor windows.
Behind the trailer is a shack - 'my office', he calls it - where there are
neat rows of files, a fax machine and a desk-top computer.
Peter Mercer's gadgets are a sign that gypsies are asserting themselves
after centuries of persecution. This time, finding themselves again under
attack, they are fighting back with demands for recognition as a race with
its own history and culture, and the right to travel and congregate however
inconvenient for the increasingly suburban societies in which they live.
In the past, gypsies have been more victimised than tolerated. Today, they
are winning sympathy and supporters. For, according to Dr Thomas Acton,
Reader in Romani Studies at the new University of Greenwich in London, they
are facing the biggest crisis for a generation caused by a 'moral panic'
among governments in Europe.
Acton estimates that 100,000 of them have fled from eastern to western
Europe following the collapse of communist rule and the breakdown of social
order. Many others have exploited the new permeability of European borders
to migrate in search of work. (The German government paid Romania Dollars
21m 18 months ago to take back 40,000 deportees who had been driven from
their villages.)
British gypsies have a specific grievance: the criminal justice bill now
going through parliament. The relevant clauses of this bill look very much
like an attempt to stamp out nomadism altogether. They remove the obligation
on local authorities to provide sites for travellers' caravans, while giving
new powers to police, landowners and the authorities to move people on.
Refusal could lead to vehicles being impounded and children taken into care.
This measure, say government spokesmen, is not aimed at gypsies in
particular. It is to remove the taxpayer's open-ended commitment to house
people who choose to live a nomadic life and to stop them parking illegally.
Nomad numbers in Britain have increased unexpectedly in the last decade:
some are Irish, driven out by tougher legislation, but mostly they are the
so-called new age travellers, drop-outs by accident or by design. Choose
nomadism if you like, says the government, but if you do, you must find a
legal place to camp.
The Commission for Racial Equality says the proposed legislation
discriminates against gypsies and has supported attempts to amend it. Peter
Mercer has another word for it: genocidal.
'It's a strong word,' he agreed. 'But genocide is not just putting people in
gas chambers like the Holocaust.' (Between 500,000 and 750,000 gypsies were
killed in the German death camps during the second world war and another
million may have been shot outside.) 'Genocide is when you stop people
meeting, stop festivals, stop the freedom of movement, destroy one's
culture, everything gypsy people do. I'm not talking about raves, which
they're on about. I've never yet found out what a rave is. To me it's kids
doing head-banging or summat. But if we can't go to places like Appleby
(horse fair) or Stow on the Wold . . .'
Mercer has a small caravan beside his trailer on a site outside
Peterborough, where he is the district council's gypsy liaison officer. But
most of his travelling these days is done by air. As the British member of
the presidium of the International Romani Union, he has visited Warsaw,
Prague, Bucharest, Gottingen, Geneva, Bordeaux.
Why, then, does he live in a trailer?
'Up until I started this work I was nomadic. Then I had to have a base to
work from. On the road you don't have electricity points. You don't have a
microwave and your washing machine. You're cooking outside in the main - an
open fire, which is a lot better than this rubbish (he indicated the smart
panelled kitchenette).
'In the finish you find out you're laden down with all modern contraptions
which you start becoming dependent on. Having said that, at the end of the
day we like to be in a position where we can go away if we wish.'
You may never move from here?
'I may never. But it is there. It is my right to the freedom of movement and
the right to choose where I live. And that is so important to gypsy people.
If I wanted to be gone, I could . I could get rid of all this in 10 minutes
flat.'
To assert their ethnic claim - now recognised by the Council of Europe, the
European Union and, increasingly, the English courts - has meant accepting
the word 'gypsy'. As with 'didicoy', 'pikey' or 'mumper' it has a derogatory
flavour but Mercer recognises that his preferred designation of 'traveller'
is no longer adequate.
He can demonstrate his racial origins, he said, despite the infrequency of
gypsy marriages, through family ties, baptismal certificates and the
genealogical records of the Mormons. Gypsies migrated from the Rajput area
of northern India about 1,000 years ago after being defeated by Moslem
armies. They were warriors, armourers, swordsmiths, or musicians and
traders, with their own noble families. Their language, now written down,
has many dialects but is based on Sanskrit.
'It's not the nicest thing in the world to be a gypsy,' Mercer said. 'Even
today. Our flag is blue for sky, green for fields with a red wheel to show
suffering.'
I asked him if new age travellers should have the same rights as gypsies.
'People have a right to live their way of life as they wish, so long as they
don't rob and steal off people or move into their house or their garden. I
don't say I like the way they live and I don't say that it is fair what they
are doing. But it is their right to choose.'
Are they muddying the waters for gypsies?
'Oh, most certainly. One can't get away from that. A lot of local
authorities and even the government is using them as a stepping board to
give us a kick.'
I asked him if there was much gypsy migration into Britain from Europe.
Mercer said there was a big concentration of Bosnian gypsies in London, a
large number of Poles and some French. He insisted they were no threat to
the native gypsies because they brought their own particular skills with
them.
'This government ought to accept them. I think this is one reason why
they're trying to do away with nomadism in this country - the fear that
we're going to get an influx from abroad. The police now are stopping
caravans and road-testing them to try and stop the migrants. It looks like
some Home Office directive to make things damned awkward.'
Before he became an international civil servant, Mercer did fruit-picking
and scrap metal. He comes from the area around Hull and during the war, at
the age of eight, was taken into care. He was brought up by Roman Catholic
nuns. 'Some of them were lovable, really beautiful people,' he said. 'Other
ones were, believe me . . .' He left the sentence unfinished.
They told him he could go home when his mother got a proper house. She
eventually did, but he was sent instead to London to work as a footman,
serving at table for the residents of a block of flats. 'I was there a month
at most, because I was frightened of the church and the power they might
have over me.'
So he joined the army, following his father who was wounded at Dunkirk and
an uncle who was killed on the Burma railway.
'A lot of people think gypsy people avoid military service. Not true.' He
served with the Duke of Wellington's regiment in Cyprus during the Eoka
uprising where, he said, because of a dispute between superior officers he
had the distinction of being made a lance-corporal twice in one day.
'You appreciate, in the army I was a bit of a wild dog. I joined to try and
make a life and follow a family tradition in a way, 'cos my father was
saying the army is good for you, make a man of you. I found it fairly tame.'
After national service and three years of re-enlistment, Mercer quit the
army and 'knocked around doing scrap and making a nuisance of myself in
general like you do'. He married, but his wife refused to live in a trailer.
He bought her a house but the marriage broke up and he met his present wife
while picking fruit. 'She calmed me down a little bit and I got involved in
civil rights.'
So now you're a politician and bureaucrat?
'Well, not a bureaucrat.' He said the word with distaste. 'Nowhere near.
Bureaucracy's the last thing in the world I like. I won't fill in time
sheets, I won't fill in movement sheets. I don't even claim for expenses.
'The nuns taught nothing beyond decimals. Within our community I'm a scholar
because I can read, write and I can do one or two things. But my education
has come from life, and having to do things for meself. It's an expertise
you build up over the years, isn't it?'.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Sport: Is this grand prix's saviour? - Motor Racing / The
flag rises on the first season with a 'technology ban'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Max Mosley may have saved grand prix from itself. When the cars line up for
the start of the Brazilian grand prix at Interlagos tomorrow, they will no
longer have on board highly complex electronic systems which have been
painstakingly, and expensively, developed by the leading teams.
Out go traction control, anti-lock brakes and 'active' suspension systems
under the 'technology ban' which Mosley has orchestrated in his role as
president of the Federation Internationale de l'automobile, the
Paris-headquartered motoring organisation which is also the world's
governing body of motor sport.
Inevitably, there have been grumbles from front-running teams such as
Williams and McLaren, which have invested so much time, money and effort in
them.
But, in the small Knightsbridge office which serves as the FIA's London
base, Mosley - former racing driver and March racing team founder - this
week painted a startling picture of just how far the technology had already
gone in taking control of the car away from the driver, and why the
authorities felt they had no choice but to intervene.
The logical consequence of the route the technology was taking, he
maintains, was the virtual disappearance of the driver's role - and with it,
sport administrators feared, spectator interest in what would have become a
life-size Nintendo game.
'This trend is already happening with road cars, which are becoming more and
more self-driving, and this is a good thing because it will reduced stress
and road accidents.
'But there was a device in use (in grand prix) last season in which, when
the red lights turned to green, the driver would press a button; the
computer would maintain the engine at optimum revs; it was the computer
which depressed the clutch, engaged first gear, let the clutch out, stopped
the wheels spinning, changed up to second gear when necessary, then into
third and so on. All the time, although spectators weren't aware of it, the
driver would just steer, thereby eliminating one of the great skills of
racing.'
Without the ban, this year would have seen the introduction of a sensor to
watch the start lights. 'When they went to green it would have started the
whole process automatically, without the driver even pressing a button.'
And that, says Mosley, was just current stuff. Coming along was technology
which would steer all four wheels so that if you went into corner too fast
and slid, the computer would sort it out. Provided the driver didn't make a
fundamental misjudgment beyond the laws of physics, it would turn any driver
into a Senna.
'Endless similar things were coming. And we thought that if we allowed these
things to continue, we would fairly quickly eliminate the driver. One skill
after another would go until, in the end, almost anybody would be able to
drive the car. It's all technically fascinating and very relevant to road
cars - but we felt it would destroy an essential element of grand prix
racing,' said Mosley
However, the widely-held perception that grand prix is turning its back on
technology per se is wrong, he maintains. 'The car can still be as
high-technology as you like, and that is the way Formula One should be. The
only caveat is that it must not replace the driver.'
After lengthy discussion of the detailed regulations with teams and the
Formula One Constructors Association - led by FIA vice-president Bernie
Ecclestone - Mosley insists: 'No team is going to Brazil in any doubt about
what we (the FIA) think on any issue.' Mosley and Ecclestone say there will
be harsh penalties for any team that seeks to use the technology
surreptitiously.
One hoped-for result from the ban is that: 'in a given car the best driver
will be able to demonstrate his superiority'.
Thus when the lights go green tomorrow drivers will be competing more evenly
than for years.
With recent world champions out of the running with Alain Prost confirming
his retirement and Nigel Mansell racing for a second year in IndyCars, the
questions are endless: will Damon Hill really not be intimidated by his new
team-mate at Williams, the ruthless, three-time world champion Ayrton Senna?
Will Mika Hakkinen, the young flying Finn, be able to mount an effective
challenge in the McLaren-Peugeot? Is this the year that Jean Alesi finally
brings Ferrari back from obscurity? Or will the hard-charging German Michael
Schumacher give Benetton its big break?
But it will be what happens further down the field which will be almost as
important for Mosley. The technology ban, he hopes, will give a break to the
smaller teams for whom developing such technology 'would have been ruinous
in the current economic climate.'
Grand prix teams cost what Mosley himself acknowledges as 'horrifying'
amounts to run. 'To be in with a chance of finishing in the points a team
needs not less than Pounds 10m, and to run at the front they would need
Pounds 30m - that's plus a deal with a major engine manufacturer.'
Even with the technology ban it will cost any team Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m just
to get on to the back of the grid and keep running. 'But if we'd kept on
going the way we were they would have needed more than Pounds 10m.'
Another positive effect of the partial technology ban is that it is already
encouraging new entries. Two new private teams, Simtek and Pacific, have
already signed up and Mosley maintains that Peugeot has come into grand prix
only because of its new-found stability.
At least two more large European manufacturers - names circulating around
the grand prix world are BMW and Audi - are expected to join as early as
next year, and Honda is also expected to return with its own engine and car.
Mosley accepts that for the leading grand prix teams, the technology ban has
been very annoying.
'But we must bear in mind that grand prix research is on a very broad front
and that what we've banned is a very narrow bit. All the rest is usable.
You've only got to look at how much faster the cars are already, even
without the banned technology, because there's been such an enormous amount
of research on aerodynamics, materials, chassis dynamics and engines.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Sport: Survival when winter stops play - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month the English cricket season starts. Hoping to get some of the hard
facts of life out of the way before that happy time, I set out to try and
understand how county cricket clubs earn their money.
By now, most first-class cricket clubs have published their accounts for
last year, before starting the season with new determination. Sometimes the
problems are old ones, such as Derbyshire's propensity for financial
torment. This led them to a record loss of Pounds 120,000 last year and
their chairman's departure.
But, more often, records were on the profit side, even in the most
unexpected places. Gloucestershire, for instance, had a year rotten with
defeat, finishing 17th out of 18 in the county championship - but ripe with
profit, to the extent of Pounds 49,050, as the secretary, Philip August,
told me jovially.
Gloucestershire, he said, had three main sources of income. Biggest by far
is a grant from the Test and County Cricket Board. I knew the TCCB
subsidised the counties, but I thought I had better hear some individual
survival tactics before hearing about the ones at central office. Besides,
the Gloucestershire officers were keen to describe their affairs a bit more
colourfully.
'We can afford to be a bit more cavalier now,' said August, assuring me that
cavalier meant enterprising. Gloucestershire is still a sensible county. One
example of enterprise is that its coaches want to give the players a
first-aid course ready for this summer and, instead of dismissing the idea
out of hand, officials can now afford to consider it. Perhaps Courtney Walsh
will learn to resuscitate his victims on the follow-through.
On the sensible side, Gloucestershire rents out the new pavilion at the
Phoenix County Ground in Bristol, whenever it is not in cricket use, as a
venue for dinners, weddings, conferences and other functions. Financially,
this is a contributor to Gloucestershire's second biggest source of income:
commercial operations.
Third, and smallest, is cricket itself. Only 12 per cent of the club's
income comes from membership fees and gate receipts. 'It's sad that's all we
get from people actually watching cricket, but that's how it is,' said
August.
Some 60 per cent of all Gloucestershire's cricket earnings comes from the
10-day festival at Cheltenham - consisting of two county and two Sunday
games, attracting local business support and sponsorship. Quiet, outlying
games make a nice change but they do not make a nice profit. That is why
most counties centre their cricket on fewer grounds with every passing year;
it is cheaper and easier that way.
But the complications of cricket finances show how strongly the counties
have retained their distinctive characters.
Warwickshire's Andrew Wilkes told me that using Edgbaston for county games
did not just make a little money - it lost money.
'By the time we've paid all the staff needed at a huge ground like that and
got everything ready, it seldom matches up to what we take from a few
hundred spectators,' he said.
Derbyshire, by contrast, has always depended heavily on gate receipts,
especially from the county ground. This season home matches will only be at
Derby and two other venues: Ilkeston and the festival ground of
Chesterfield. The county blames a lot of its money troubles on the four-day
game reducing the number of fixtures. Top priority is to attract people into
cricket, to watch and to play and, so, to make money for the club. It is
long-term, hopeful planning and it delights the club's first woman committee
member, an energetic Derbyshire nationalist called Liz Hill. One example is
the improvement of facilities for children and families at matches.
A group of players and officials will tour the whole county, fund-raising
and demonstrating the joys of cricket. Back at base, the Derby ground does
not earn money in the winter so much as look after its core of intrepid
supporters, with regular meetings and meals.
Financial troubles must not be allowed to weaken the county's
traditionally-strong community spirit. Glamorgan has gone one step further
and combined community spirit with patriotism, greatly to its advantage.
'We cashed in on a tide of Welsh nationalism, after some low years. Our
brave committee cut the membership fee from Pounds 45 in 1992 to Pounds 15
last year and our membership shot up. So did membership income, from Pounds
88,800 to Pounds 172,500; last year we made our first operating profit since
1977,' says marketing director Tony Dilloway.
The TCCB favours initiative, especially if it works, and rewarded
Glamorgan's rise from 14th to third place in the county table last year with
a generous grant. Glamorgan does not own its main grounds but rents them for
a fixed number of playing days each year. The staff spend the winter
recruiting support all over Wales: they have no time for commercial
operations. 'We get our money from cricket, not hospitality boxes.'
Just to complete the assortment of different approaches to cricket finances
 -Warwickshire told me proudly that its record profit of Pounds 289,024 last
year owed much to the Edgbaston hospitality boxes. They are sought after as
prime places to watch cricket, do business deals and lap up luxury.
The people who run Warwickshire are realists. They know they depend on their
commercial operations, which they see as intrinsic to modern cricket. A fair
share of the large sum they received from the TCCB last year had been paid
to the TCCB by Warwickshire in the first place. Test grounds put the profits
from test matches and one-day internationals into the TCCB's 'pool', the
central source of supply for all the first-class cricket clubs, including
minor counties, according to their size and needs.
It is a kind of Robin Hood system, designed to keep the county system going.
Such credit was given by all the counties, rich and poor alike, to this
time-honoured system, with its newly-increased resources, that I felt almost
uneasy.
I talked to the TCCB's chief accountant, Cliff Barker, who was amiable,
happy to agree that the TCCB had made more money in the last few years, but
less happy to give details of how it had achieved this. 'Mainly from English
home matches,' he said, adding that last year test match crowds worldwide
were falling, but in England they rose 22 per cent, in spite of defeat by
Australia.
He attributed much of this to Sunday play in test matches.
'Another bonus we have now is in the bigger broadcasting fees resulting from
the BBC having to compete with rivals Sky TV.' I asked him if he liked Sky's
cricket coverage. 'I like the ending of a monopoly,' replied Barker.
The TCCB is the sole organiser of all the sponsorship deals for test and
one-day internationals, redistributing its earnings around the counties.
Barker assured me that the counties were free to spend their 'pool' money as
they liked; only the buying of players was controlled, by a board of all the
teams.
County cricket is big business and it is run as a big business in order to
survive. But only honour is more important than money if the traditional
nature of the game is to thrive.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Sport: Precision is the Cambridge hallmark - The Boat Race /
Oxford are underdogs but do not write them off - they have achieved the
improbable before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A boat race poster in the rowers' gym on the Iffley Road in Oxford asks: Can
Oxford ever win? Until last year's race the poster's inquiry centred on
Cambridge but after Oxford's defeat, a perceptive Dark Blue rower with a
sense of humour changed it.
It was a gesture that marked the end of Oxford's dominance in the varsity
boat race. Before last year's Light Blue victory, Cambridge had won only one
race in the last 17. Oxford had a stranglehold on the Beefeater trophy that
threatened impartial interest in the race.
Furthermore, Cambridge seemed impotent in the face of such superiority.
However, this year Cambridge are the stronger crew and will start the race
today at 12.30pm as hot favourites. What changed?
The tide began to turn before last year's race and the change was obscured
as Oxford pulled out a couple of remarkable victories against the odds. The
Dark Blue wins in 1991 and 1992 masked some frailties. The Oxford crews were
big and strong but their technique looked heavy handed. Recent Oxford crews
have struggled in the last month before the race and have relied on Mike
Spracklen, a renowned international coach, to wave the magic wand in the
final two weeks. However, Spracklen and his wand are missing this year.
Nothing epitomises the change between the two camps more than their approach
to coaching. Cambridge have had only two head coaches in the last five years
while Oxford have changed head coaches every year for four years. The
Cambridge crews have benefited from the consistency.
They row with a precise and fluid style. It is a style often found in top
lightweight crews that cannot substitute size for skill. Eight blades come
down to the water as one at the catch and emerge smoothly from the water at
the finish. The Cambridge style was pronounced in a recent race with a
potential Great Britain eight, rowing as Leander. The Light Blues left the
internationals wallowing four lengths adrift. After that encounter, Brian
Armstrong, director of international rowing in this country, described
Cambridge as the best varsity crew he had seen, worthy of a world
championship final.
Oxford's coaching difficulties exploded in their faces last weekend. Richard
Tinkler, head coach, and his assistant, Tim Bramfitt, were asked to step
aside in the final week to allow Fred Smallbone, former Olympic oarsman, to
take over.
Tinkler and Bramfitt took this badly and after a public argument between
them and the crew on the towpath they retreated in a huff. Oxford, it was
argued, needed a fresh face and voice. Something new to lift their
confidence in the last few days. The two coaches saw it differently and felt
this was scant reward for six months very hard work.
The hub of the dispute is a clash of personality between Tinkler and Jo
Michaels, a former Oxford boat club president who is preparing for his
fourth boat race. Tinkler saw Michaels as disruptive and said he was
becoming an anchor on the boat. Steve Royle, director of Oxford rowing,
called for a vote of confidence in the coaches, which went 8-1 in the
coaches' favour. The lugubrious Michaels, moving to protect his seat, was
the only dissenter. Strangely, the Oxford camp then decided to go for
Smallbone.
Some of the Oxford rowers are as confused as Tinkler and Bramfitt - who have
been told they are very much part of the set up and have done nothing wrong.
On Monday, the pair sardonically sipped coffee from the boathouse as they
watched the Dark Blues take to the water.
Ten yards away, Cambridge exuded inner harmony. Their coach for the run-in
to the race is the New Zealander, Harry Mahon. The tanned and bearded Mahon
looks as if he has just come from an Antarctic expedition. He stresses
movement and rhythm to his charges who reward him with a silky smooth style
with subtle changes in gear and speed.
Mahon is coy about Cambridge's alleged superiority: 'It might be more
interesting than the pundits are saying. Oxford have moved up a notch.' He
constantly returns to movement as if he were a choreographer and uses
analogies from the dance world. 'Moving like hell, instead of pulling like
hell, using movement to put more power on the blade.'
Cambridge have trained harder this year with outings frequently lasting up
to 110 minutes and hour-long ergometer (rowing machine) sessions.
Martin Haycock, last year's winning cox, is back in the driving seat after
an earlier de-selection. He will not be drawn on today's outcome: 'In
theory, this boat is faster than last year with a very fast base speed. We
have four of last year's crew plus the cox, that really helps.'
However, Oxford have responded well to the recent troubles. Steve Royle's
calming presence has influenced the crew who have improved markedly. Oxford
are relishing the role of the underdog and plan to capitalise on any
Cambridge complacency. Oxford have done the improbable before and should not
be written off.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Old fish sleep, and man wreaks havoc: Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salmon fishers are superstitious beings. The approach to a new fishing pool
provides signals, salient indicators. When I asked in the tiny Irish village
of Killavullen for river-keeper Frank Maher, they said: 'He'll be on the
island; he's always there.' A salmon beat with a resident keeper holds
promise.
The physical approach consolidated this. You drive a curving avenue of
superbly lofty beeches. The track drops into a boreen, or rough lane, and
from here I could detect, across the River Blackwater, through the foliage,
an aquamarine parasol, high-up.
But what could be more natural than a parasol under which to eat lunch? By
some occult premonition Frank had this repast just laid out.
Lunch - lettuce and spring onions, grown by him on his island of course,
plus a pork-hunk - was served in his hidey-house on stilts, under the
parasol, and a bottle of whiskey was plonked down beside. His pet robin
watched on the rail. Frank, the complete ghillie, had rods, personally tied
flies, and, in the eventuality of me failing to deliver, a frozen salmon to
take away.
As you may have guessed, Frank Maher is a central part of fishing this beat.
The extraordinary workload he puts in here is, in his words, convalescing.
For Frank is a retired building foreman and has 10 children. It says
something for him (and of Ireland) that nine of these have settled with
their spreading families all around him in this luxuriant, mellow corner of
county Cork.
His voice is like a faraway train in a tunnel, and throaty with
cigarette-intake; his face brown and seamed. His all-round ghillieing
service includes cooking breakfast while you fish the dawn-pool.
Grubbing, as Frank called eating, was followed, while resting the fishing
pools in mid-afternoon, by pulling, known elsewhere as drinking stout.
After two days of this, repairing late through the leafy lanes to my hotel,
I felt as if Frank and I had been on his island for a week.
The fishery? I nearly forgot. Old fish slept in pools, even when Frank
rolled worms down into their murky lairs. Grilse showed. One kept splashing
in a resident spot, slowly skipping.
The water-surface over it was not only flat, but very slow, making all
advances futile. Frank intended to remedy this supreme irritant by adjusting
a dried-out channel which ran through his island and was presently blocked
by rocks. This would quicken water gliding over the lie.
There had been a silage spill on the Blackwater a short way upstream, and to
this we attributed our lack of luck. By day three, the perpetual misty rain
had slightly lifted the water-height, and by the time Frank had done his
stuff in the frying-pan, two grilse were on the bank. He was jubilant,
presenting me with the fishing book to enter them immediately, in case we
caught so many later we would lose count.
It all had to end. I consumed my last sausage and Frank and I adjourned to
his local in Doneraile to do some pulling. The landlord, deadened by tales
of vanished Blackwater salmon, listened in amazement when Frank told him he
had been frightened by runs of fish vaulting past him, and had stepped aside
to let them pass.
Frank retired to the bosom of his township-sized family and I headed west
for the River Slaney in Wexford.
This proved to be a river more talked about than fished. Slaney is the name
mentioned after Blackwater in Irish fishing - or it used to be. Once
Ireland's best spring river, the Slaney is dying. Catches have started to
decline sharply. On some beats the run is only just detectable. Two of the
best traditional 200-fish beats only managed to creep into double figures
this year.
Aided by Lar Kenny, a ghillie of 38 years experience, and others, I built up
a portrait of woe. Kenny knows fish and he maintains that, in retrospect,
the signs of fish distress showed long ago. The salmon stopped their
characteristic dolphin-action 'head-and-tailing'; they ran through pools
they should have stopped in. Sea trout entered the river only just prior to
spawning, then vamoosed again. Water quality continued deteriorating.
As sheep stocking increased in the hills, riverbank grazing intensified and
clear, gravelly beds became weed-matted and blackened. Young fish lacked
vital oxygen, and a current study reports 14 traditional nursery areas
devoid of fish life.
As the salmon stock came under environmental pressure the awesome
abstractions from 75 bag-nets in the 14-mile long estuary increased.
Political pressure from the netsmen, protesting at low catches, resulted in
an extended season.
Meantime it became clear that, for a variety of political reasons, the
heavily-mortgaged fishing-boats working off Donegal would continue their
illegal drift-netting for salmon without effective restraint. Efforts to
improve the marine fisheries protection service were met with an escalation
of intimidation and violence. It is a fisheries war which officialdom seems
content to lose.
The Slaney salmon, which has survived the obstacle course in salt waters,
now ascends its home river to find, half-way up, an imperfectly-functioning
fish-pass attached to a Jerry-built weir. Out of this private hydroelectric
scheme comes only pitiful quantities of electricity. For the rare survivors
which pass the weir in a flood there is the prospect of being speared under
nightlamps while laying eggs in the spawning-beds (redds).
The ingenuity of wickedness is educational. The over-extended bailiff-force
does manage, in autumn, to visit the upstream redds. But while the bailiffs
supervise, red and inedible spawners were being pinioned and perforated by
pitchforks elsewhere.
Poor Slaney, with its swans and kingfishers and otters and
beautifully-coloured riverbed; with its backdrop of verdant fields which
lean into the bluey, faraway hills. What man in his furious cycle of
pilfering has done to your natural richness.
Michael Wigan stayed at Springfort, near Hall, near Mallow, in Cork, and the
Slaney at Ballinkeele House, Ballymurphy, Wexford. His flight was arranged
by Aer Lingus.

FT  26 MAR 94 / When a chapel is made redundant: Heritage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not just Britain's fine old parish churches that have had a hard time
attracting congregations in recent years. Many nonconformist chapels find
themselves in the same position.
However, to some eyes, not many of the 4,000 chapels that are listed
buildings are as architecturally appealing as their Anglican counterparts.
This means plans to make them redundant, in the same way as churches, have
to be tempered with the fact that few would be likely to attract a steady
stream of visitors.
Generally, most chapels that are declared redundant are put to other use. In
a small number of cases a building has been considered to be of such
architectural merit that to convert it into a house or business premises was
deemed inappropriate. Most of these higher grade buildings are recognised by
having a grade I or grade II* listing, which in itself presents a problem.
If the building is a fine one, but no longer in demand for its original
purpose, what do you do with it if you are not allowed to convert it to
another use?
Since last summer this problem has been laid at the South Kensington door of
Jennifer Freeman, a former secretary of The Victorian Society, and the first
director of the Historic Chapels Trust for England. She has the task of
finding teams of local 'friends' willing to take the finest redundant
chapels under their wing on a care and maintenance basis and to arrange for
groups of visitors to tour them when they wish.
Occasionally, this meant formalising an already existing arrangement. But in
the case of buildings such as the Friends Meeting House, at Farfield near
Bradford, West Yorkshire, it is very different. The chapel, a grade II*
stone building built in 1689, has not been used regularly for religious
meetings since the beginning of the last century. In 1957 three members of
the congregation bought the building to prevent it from being converted into
a house.
They are now elderly and have agreed to hand the building over to the trust,
which will arrange for a new set of carers to take the building under their
wing.
A similar case is the splendid Unitarian chapel at Todmorden near Halifax,
West Yorkshire. This is a grade I listed building dating from the 1860s
capable of seating 450. For many years services were held in the nearby
church lodge, which was large enough for the average weekly congregation of
between 20 and 30.
Two years ago, however, the congregation was disbanded and the trust, soon
to be owners of the building, has the task of finding a group of local
volunteers that will care for it.
The other two buildings likely to be acquired this year are Walpole Chapel,
Suffolk, a 19th century Congregational building closed more than 20 years
ago, and the Baptist Chapel at Cote, near Witney in Oxfordshire. Both are
listed grade II*. The Cote chapel dates from 1604 but has not been used for
regular services since 1980. The local congregation worships at a newer
building in a nearby village and has great difficulty maintaining the old
chapel.
As well as nonconformist chapels the trust is hoping to take on a handful of
Roman Catholic chapels of architectural merit that are no longer used for
regular worship. Freeman would also like to add a synagogue to the
portfolio.
The trust receives an annual grant from the Department of National Heritage.
It has also launched an appeal to assist with its work which has attracted
sponsorship from several large companies. Individual membership of the trust
costs Pounds 10, joint membership Pounds 15, and life membership Pounds 250.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Gardening: Farewell to a gardener of rare vision - A woman
whose skills spanned two societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardens are wonderfully ahead of schedule and, like those of you who are
starting out on a new site, I find myself beginning with plants up walls.
Unlike you, I find myself thrown back on old memories.
Climbers are needing attention in this early season but, first, mine must
pay a tribute to one of their great exponents. Last weekend, British
gardening lost a special person when Alvilde Lees-Milne died in her 84th
year. She was the wife of architectural historian James Lees-Milne;
co-editor of the best-selling Englishwoman's Garden; and herself the maker
of two post-war gardens of rare distinction.
Neither a climber nor a rambler, Alvilde had spanned two different
societies, southern France and post-war Gloucestershire. Nowadays,
expatriate English export their own taste to their enclaves in France, but
Alvilde stood for a subtle and opposite approach. She absorbed French style
and formality, not merely in gardens but also in fashion, and tempered it to
her later life in the western Cotswolds.
Her mental vision of a garden was unusually Anglo-French. I remember our
first encounter, from which I inferred (wrongly) that this old rose was
waiting to show its prickles. Are you the young man who likes tree lupins
but does not like herb gardens, she asked me. You should learn to like herb
gardens and dislike tree lupins.
Several of us were standing round over cocktails, having just won prizes for
writing books, and I had no idea that my apt deflator was herself the owner
of Britain's most stylish herb garden and had stood her ground aesthetically
in many exchanges with Vita Sackville-West, with whom she had been an
intimate friend. The Sissinghurst which you like so much, Alvilde told me
firmly, is no longer Sissinghurst: these days, it is much too tidy.
This was in the mid-1970s and she was planning to move from her big garden
at Alderley Grange to something smaller, colder and much more limited. She
found it at Essex House in Badminton, Gloucestershire, where she made her
superb second garden far more quickly than I, meanwhile, made my first.
Not only did she have a marvellous eye for climbing roses and vertical
plants but that eye also valued a strong, formal framework, clipped in box
hedging and topiary patterns long before Sir Roy Strong championed this
style from a vantage point even further west. Only within this
firmly-controlled framework did she let plants have their way, the English
aspect to her Anglo-French aesthetic.
At Sissinghurst, the female eye was more Oriental and romantic, whereas the
firm framework came from the male half of the partnership. In
Gloucestershire, Alvilde was every bit a match for her architectural
partner; she did not want an unstructured feminine paradise and, on
subsequent meetings, I came to realise that what had first sounded like
coldness or even sharpness was, instead, a shy and exact reflection of this
formal sense which showed in her view of a garden. She never relented on
tree lupins, though.
From Alvilde, I learnt to spread wall shrubs and young climbers on to a fan
of long bamboo canes set against a wall, one for each young shoot. The stems
will then grow apart without criss-crossing and will give you an open,
well-furnished spread. Against her principles, however, I have also learned
to bring back untidiness by never planting one climber when two will do.
This weekend, when you buy the best of all climbing roses, the pale pink New
Dawn, or agitate about the elusive white rose Sombreuil (which, Alvilde
said, was neglected unjustly in England), remember to buy a later-flowering
clematis and plant it beside each rose.
The blue Perle D'Azur, or the small-flowered Viticellas or Texensis
varieties - even The President, which comes earlier - will grow up through
the roses and give you the further season which most books ignore.
I have been slow to recognise the possibilities here, but they go beyond
clematis and roses. I now have a climbing solanum scrambling through my
favourite evergreen on walls: the cream-variegated Rhamnus, which also was a
Lees-Milne favourite. The scarlet Eccremocarpus will scramble up through a
climbing hydrangea.
I have late-flowering clematis through the spring-flowering evergreen
clematis Armandii. And I now mix wild sweet peas into the lower reaches of
the yellow-flowered clematis Bill Mackenzie, a star turn on a sunny wall
(which you can cut back this weekend to within 3ft of its base).
Double up: break the rules and extend the season. Even rose Sombreuil is an
admirable host for the vigorous clematis Jackmandii if you do not prune the
clematis too hard, so encouraging it to reach above the rose and flower over
its head. Once you begin these combinations, you will find that you double
the scope of your house wall.
My vision of the next 10 years is one of gardens in smallish spaces, planted
in great (but selective) profusion, which break out from a slight framework
of green hedging and edging; Sissinghurst, perhaps, as Alvilde knew it in
its owners' later phase.
She might have wished for a clearer continental outline; but then, I still
like those tree lupins - and I have to say that I have never liked any herb
garden except for hers.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Property: Back under starter's orders - Demand is picking up
for properties with an equine emphasis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1994 flat racing season began on Thursday in a happier horse world than
1993. This is not just the perverse optimism that owners, trainers, jockeys
and punters need to survive in a chancy business, nor the success of the
recent Cheltenham festival.
No, the signs are good. The December Tattersall sales at Newmarket were
encouraging as prices for bloodstock beat expectations - if 'from a low
base', as George Windsor Clive, of equestrian property specialist
Christopher Stephenson International (CSI), remarked - and more horses are
in training.
Prices for horsey properties have stabilised, too, and breeders are starting
to think again of buying stud farms although there is no boom in sight;
prices must be reasonable to attract buyers. The Jevington Place stud farm
(with 33 loose boxes) in East Sussex is now under offer, soon after CSI
brought it back to the market, and will go for a sum well down on the
original Pounds 1m minimum asking price.
In the south-west, estate agent Millerson reports that demand has picked up
for horsey properties. Families look for five to 10 acres to go with their
house and two or three loose boxes. Professional riders want indoor (or
outdoor) rings and a yard with plenty of stabling.
Prices are attractive. In Devon, West Quither Farm near Tavistock (11 acres,
four boxes, outdoor school) is on offer at Pounds 159,950; and Mews Cottage
Farm near Okehampton (eight acres, eight stables, grazing rights on
Okehampton common and riding on Dartmoor) at Pounds 165,000. On Exmoor,
Tufters is for sale as a working business for over Pounds 300,000; it sends
out out plenty of horses for hire for fox and stag hunting (the agent is
named Stags, too).
Stud farms have been hard to sell in recent times as the only buyers are
other horse people. These must have deep pockets or be able to call on
backers - who, often in the horse world, fail to show at the moment of need.
Those owners who are making their stud farms around Newmarket 'quietly
available' at Pounds 7,000-Pounds 15,000 an acre (through CSI) are probably
wise to do so. The serious buyers will find them.
In Surrey, a stud on public offer is Grafham Farm near Guildford; it has 16
boxes, an indoor school, and 48 acres of paddocks plus house, cottage,
swimming pool and tennis court - all for around Pounds 600,000 from CSI. The
owner is selling to move her operations to a larger property.
Another that has been on the market for some time is Rookery Park near
Nantwich, Cheshire (CSI, offers over Pounds 1m).
New on the market is Longfield Stud at Middleton Tyas in Yorkshire (near
Scotch Corner, where the A66 separates from the A1), for which Lowther
Scott-Harden asks Pounds 310,000. Nearby, overlooking the village green, is
West Hall, a handsome Grade II house on offer for more than Pounds 495,000.
The vendors of both are the agent's chairman and his wife.
Near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, West Stow Stud - in tip-top condition with
18 boxes - is for sale from Bedford for Pounds 535,000.
Equestrian centres is the modern, grand name for the places in which horses
are trained in the skills of dressage and show jumping. Near Cirencester in
the scenic Cotswolds, Crawshaw has 13 loose boxes and a fine outdoor school.
The price is down from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 295,000 (from Butler
Sherborn and CSI).
In Scotland, John Bradburne is starting an equestrian property agency under
his own name on April 6. An amateur rider under National Hunt rules (he rode
at Cheltenham last week) and husband of trainer Sue Bradburne, he set up the
equestrian side of Edinburgh agent Langley-Taylor in 1991. His new firm is
taking that over.
One of his first properties is Myothill riding centre at Denny in
Stirlingshire, with 24 boxes and eight paddocks for Pounds 225,000.
Bradburne also offers to let Easter Kilwhiss Farmhouse near Ladybank, with
six boxes, for more than Pounds 600 a month.
Arena UK at Grantham, Lincolnshire, is a palace among horse centres with
frequent shows and a humming business: a 'good commercial property,' says
Windsor Clive. Offers to CSI should be over Pounds 1m.
Its French equivalent, Cristal-les-Rangs at Ozoir-la-Ferriere, 15km from
Euro Disney and 26km from Paris, is available for FFr19m (Pounds 2.17m).
Some financing is available from a French bank.
In Yorkshire, Savills is selling Carr Hill House at Upper Cumberworth, near
Huddersfield, with 17 boxes for Pounds 325,000. But if all you want is a
base for hunting, Haddon Dale in Northamptonshire looks ideal: it is a
late-Georgian hunting box close to the Warwickshire and Grafton hunts. It
has four boxes and a sanded manege, six bedrooms, and three bathrooms to
ease limbs tired from a day with hounds. Price: Pounds 390,000 (from
Jackson-Stops in Northampton).
If polo is your game, Pendell Polo Stables at Shurlock Row in Berkshire
costs Pounds 375,000 from Agnew or Hamptons. And if your goal is to own a
saddlery, Savills in Cambridge is selling the Sandon Saddlery Company in two
parts (at Sandon, Hertfordshire, for Pounds 350,000 and Holt, Norfolk, for
Pounds 250,000). Combined turnover is Pounds 490,000. The company
specialises in side saddles and western-type saddles.
And what is available for horsey folk who do not want to be too close to the
muck and sweat? Across the road from Sandown Park racecourse in Surrey,
Octagon is building Pemberton Place, a courtyard development with prices
ranging between Pounds 245,000 and Pounds 345,000.
At Newmarket, Dencora is finishing The Gallops, 18 apartments where you can
wake up to see the horses exercising on the heath from your bedroom window.
The agent is Jackson-Stops; prices between Pounds 85,000 and Pounds 138,000.
You could, of course, choose the flat in the stable yard clock tower at
Chippenham Park outside Newmarket (through Bidwells for around Pounds
79,500). The clock mechanism is in the attic.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Travel: Self-catering in stately style - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a cold and windy night as we drove along the country lanes around
Bath, looking for our medieval moat house. And there it was, grey and
stately, a fire blazing in the oak-panelled sitting room, grand piano in the
hall, four-poster in the bedroom with a decanter of sherry and chocolates on
a small table by the fireplace. The en suite panelled bathroom had a
free-standing bath and sociable chairs.
This was our self-catering home for the weekend, the house once host to
William III. It is now managed by Rural Retreats (tel: 0386-701177), a small
company offering 'roses-round-the-door' cottages to medieval mansions.
Visitors are able to arrive and leave any day of the week, with a minimum
two-night stay for most properties - a rare facility in self-catering, where
Saturday-to-Saturday bookings are usually required.
The standard of self-catering accommodation in Britain has shot up over the
past few years. It might still be a question of changing one kitchen sink
for another, but there are microwaves, fridge/freezers, washing machines and
driers in well-equipped kitchens to soften the chores. Several companies
provide baskets of groceries, a bottle of wine and pre-cooked meals: Rural
Retreats sends menus in advance to choose from.
In his English Country Cottages brochure (tel: 0328-851155), Rowland
Hardwick certainly offers the stuff of railway enthusiasts' dreams. The
company's properties, which are also in Scotland and Wales, include a former
railway carriage (Pounds 160 for three nights) and a parcels office (Pounds
136 for three nights) both with living/dining room, bathroom, double bedroom
and kitchen, at Horsebridge Station in Hampshire.
If you fancy an inshore lighthouse, Gothic temple, Victorian water tower,
royal palace or converted pigsty, try the Landmark Trust (tel: 0628-825925),
a charity set up in 1965 to rescue small historic buildings and open them to
the public for short holidays.
In turn, 45 of the 200 National Trust self-catering properties (tel:
0225-791199) are in, or close to, trust houses, and visitors are free to
wander round their sumptuous gardens when day visitors have gone.
Some companies stick to specific areas they can keep an eye on: Helpful
Holidays (tel: 0647-433593) covers the west country, and its 400 properties
include a thatched hexagonal gingerbread house, a former gamekeeper's home
for six, a Napoleonic Fort for 20, with an 80ft living room and an
almost-private beach.
Quality Cottages (tel: 0348-837873) covers the Welsh coast from
Pembrokeshire to Anglesey and offers discounts for couples and families up
to four.
Americans specify castles rather than big houses, according to Melody
Macdonald, who runs Castles and Country Estates (tel: 071-373-1451). The
English, she says, are more concerned with swimming pools, tennis courts and
being within easy reach of somewhere else.
Her brochure is awash with castles packed with portraits and heirlooms. One,
on a 500-acre estate with staff included, sleeps 25. She has properties in
London, too.
If you want the freedom of self-catering without too much of the catering,
try Budock Vean Country House Hotel near Falmouth (tel: 0326-250288) or Hell
Bay Hotel, Isles of Scilly (tel: 0720-22947).
Longlands, at Cartmel in Cumbria (tel: 05395-36475) won the 1993
'Self-catering holiday of the year' category in the England for Excellence
awards for its pretty courtyard cottages - the owners offer home-cooked
meals, and free use of a nearby heated pool and spa bath.
In London, the newly-opened Orion London Apartment Hotel (tel:
071-566-8000), opposite the Barbican Centre, has studios for two and
apartments for up to four.
If you want to see before you choose, contact Brights of Nettlebed (tel:
0803-215595), which, to help you decide, sends a video of its three and
four-bedroom houses with gardens and views in Torquay.

In rage and terror, the bull tore free of its captors, flew past me and
rampaged out of control down the main street. The creature had been right to
struggle, yet his heroic and violent resistance could not alter the fact
that the last wooden building in the street, the slaughterhouse, was getting
nearer.
He was not really out of control. The three young local farmers had simply
loosened their grip on the ropes as their constant goading of the wretched
animal finally became too much for him. It had taken them 40 minutes to drag
him as many yards, slithering through the mud and letting out groans of
anguish. He knew where he was going, and yet by charging at his tormentors
he was playing into their hands.
Such violence and cruelty seemed incongruous amid the tranquil surroundings
of El Castillo. The river bends at this point, and the jungle yields briefly
to the pressures of 20th century agriculture. This minor event in the
stately passage of the Rio San Juan is marked by a modest hill, crowned by
the remains of a 16th century fort, a reminder that this part of southern
Nicaragua was once a prize to be fought over by the world's foremost
economic powers, Spain and England.
For centuries this wide, navigable river, which flows into the huge Lake
Nicaragua, seemed the most likely place to build a waterway linking the
Atlantic to the Pacific, although it lost out to Panama.
There is only one real street in El Castillo, the village the Spaniards
built. It runs all the way along the river and round the base of the hill,
and is lined with little wooden houses. There are no cars. The nearest road
is in San Carlos, three hours away by motorboat. And San Carlos is hardly a
transport hub - if you miss the bus you have to wait four days for the next
one.
People do not go there much these days. Why should they? It is not on the
way to anywhere, except the even more remote and apparently charmless
Caribbean port of San Juan Del Norte. So I felt privileged to be there for
its biggest day of the year - the day when the minister arrived from Managua
to hand over formally the land titles to 400 families.
As the focal point of the village, the ruined fort was the natural choice
for the ceremony. Much of its ancient stone had disappeared, for the time
being, beneath swathes of blue-and-white ribbons and flags. Most of the
grass had disappeared, too, beneath the feet of hundreds of flag-waving,
placard-bearing peasant farmers, though enough of it remained to provide a
brilliant contrast with the searing blue sweep of the river below.
The excitement had been mounting since the previous evening, with dozens of
villagers of all ages making banners with upbeat messages of peace and
reconciliation, or little flags in the colours of the UNO government. The
sound system started blasting out uninhibited dance music from the top of
the hill from 5am the following morning.
The crowds gathering on the hill were augmented by the arrival of a number
of overladen river launches. A convoy of three helicopters, one containing
the minister for agricultural development, added a final touch of drama.
Anyone who reads the national papers in Nicaragua will know how common these
events are becoming. The authorities are not doing anything as dramatic as
transferring ownership of the land to the peasant farmers; rather, they are
legitimising their existing holdings. And that is important in itself.
I enjoyed many long conversations with the locals; everyone wanted to talk.
None of the people had great expectations of riches, or of changes in their
lives. They believed in God, and in the importance of the family. They had
limited ambitions - more and healthier food; better clothes - but they were
not, generally, dissatisfied. Some people did want more, I was told, and had
gone to work in Costa Rica, where wages are double those in Nicaragua. But
not them.
I was intrigued to find that about half the households owned a television,
although a set costs about the same as it does in the west - a king's ransom
when you are on a Nico wage. But as an old man said: 'It helps to pass the
time.'
I spent many hours watching the world go by: a man heaving load after
back-breaking load of plantains down the street; dogs and chickens
scavenging; children trying to play baseball with anything that came to
hand, such as a crushed tin can; people sprinting for cover as drizzle
turned quickly to downpour; communal singing in the two basic wooden sheds
over the road, which they refer to as churches; the flirting of teenage boys
from the hospedaje (cheap guest house) with the girls in the house opposite.
There are two places to stay in El Castillo - the hospedaje and a new
tourist hotel. I spent most of my three days at the cheaper place. It
started very promisingly: I was greeted by the friendly owner and shown to a
lovely large, clean room with three beds, plenty of room for my things, and
a window on to the veranda.
After a couple of hours, the owner asked if I would mind moving to another
room. I watched in amazement as one of his daughters gathered up a handful
of clothes from her cluttered bedroom, into which I was ushered.
I sat on the bed of this airless broom-cupboard of a room, and waited for
her to return and remove the rest of her things; but no. Towels and dresses
filled shelves and hung on hooks. Pop pin-ups adorned the walls. Perfume,
piles of clothes and all manner of personal possessions littered the room.
All that was missing was the daughter. I pushed aside a sheet to reveal a
4in spider, which darted around for a while in an agitated state before
making for the ceiling to join the lizards. There was no window; the room
was about a third of the size of the other; the door did not shut if you
were inside; and you could not switch the light on or off.
Such was the respect for my privacy that the first morning I opened my eyes
to find the daughter, no more than a couple of feet away, rummaging through
a pile of her clothes. When I asked the owner where I should put my things
he said simply: 'Put them on top of hers.'
The Albergue Turistica, built with the help of the Germans, is the new face
of tourism in Nicaragua. No need to pile your clothes on top of someone
else's here. But there is a catch: it costs Dollars 15 against Dollars 2.50
at the hospedaje, and there is no atmosphere.
When I arrived at the Albergue, I was reminded of the huge, empty castle in
Citizen Kane. A bearded Spanish gentleman finally emerged from the veranda
overlooking the village and shook me warmly by the hand. He had obviously
been caught off-guard by someone actually wanting to use the hotel.
'What have you got to drink?' I asked. He scratched his head and we went to
the kitchen to have a look in the 'fridge. Same routine for lunch. He spent
the afternoon in a business meeting, discussing ways of cashing in on the
tourist explosion which, he felt confident, was just around the corner. All
of the local farmers I spoke to were on his side, seeing tourism as the
route to a better life. But they were not holding their breath.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Travel: Fiddles, pipes and pubs in County Clare - Dowdy or
not, any town with 19 pubs deserves serious scrutiny. Nicholas Woodsworth
was equal to the task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Miltown Malbay is the kind of town people drive through to get somewhere
else. Surrounded by hay field and cow pasture and rhubarb patch, it sits in
the Irish county of Clare a mile or so inland from the Atlantic coast.
Not far away are the sort of attractions that draw busloads of sight-seers:
to the north, the battered cliffs of Moher, to the south, across the mouth
of the Shannon, the lush Ring of Kerry. But no tour-buses ever stop in
Miltown. I only stopped there myself for the pubs.
Irish pubs are remarkable. To say nothing, for the moment, of what goes on
inside them, they have a strong external visual appeal - half the arty
postcards on Ireland's news-stands are of Irish pubs. It is not just that
they are quaint and colourful. They demand a particular Irish genius, a
flair for spontaneity.
Ignore the nylon bedsheets, the plastic flowers, the porcelain ducks on the
wall, the framed, illuminated Jesus over the bed in your bed-and-breakfast
room. The same disingenuous, naive, confident and quirky style that produces
them finds its true expression in the Irish pub. Who can decorate in
forthright pink and mauve and get away with it? Only the roadside pubs and
fuchsia hedges in the west of Ireland.
The pubs of Miltown Malbay, though, failed to amaze with their facades. In
fact, they seemed dowdy and deserted, in need of a window-washing and a coat
of paint. Those with lace curtains seemed downright dusty. What was
impressive was their number. No more than 600 people live in Miltown. Yet,
scattered along its little high street - and far outnumbering such
pedestrian establishments as M Lenihan's Hair Salon and Casey's General
Drapers and Outfitters - are no less than 19 pubs. Dowdy or not, any town
with 19 pubs deserves, I thought, a looking into.
It does not take much asking around. Any citizen of Miltown will tell you
that for a large part of the year most of these places are moribund; open,
yes, but hardly busy. I stuck my head in one and withdrew it, disconcerted
by the sight of one lonely white-haired drinker sitting in front of an empty
pint glass. O'Briens and O'Donoghue's, Hillery's and Hennessey's, Cleary's,
Clancy's and Cogan's, Tulty's and Tom Malone's, the Fiddler's Inn, the
Armada Lounge, the Malbay Bar, all these and a handful more pubs survive,
but only just.
Why so many drinking establishments in the first place? Not so long ago
Miltown was a busier, more prosperous and thirstier town than it is today, a
market centre that served a countryside of cattle farms. In the age of
prolonged recession and EU production quotas, though, not even the greenest
grass in Europe can guarantee prosperity. As in many chronically depressed
towns of the Irish west that have failed to pick up on tourism, people have
lost jobs, lost heart, packed up and gone away. It is nothing new; it has
been happening on and off here ever since the potato famine.
Yet Miltown Malbay and its pubs hang on. In chatting over a large whiskey
with Muiris O'Rochain, I learned a little about the Irish music that is
keeping this town and its traditions alive.
Muiris is a cattle farmer, a tall, burly man with an outdoor complexion. Yet
all his life, like many other people in Clare, he has had a second activity,
an occupation that amounts almost to a calling - music.
In western Ireland, and in Clare particularly, traditional music - the
setting of fiddle, flute, whistle, uilleann pipes or concertina to old songs
and tunes - is more than a hobby; it is the vehicle that carries the memory
of the past.
Nor is there any question about the power of Irish music to carry such a
ponderous emotional load. In the high driving lilt of the fiddle or longing
of the uilleann pipes there is something compelling, irrationally stirring.
Like the best, simplest and strongest of arts, this is a music that draws on
something far deeper than mere intellect. What makes it different is that it
is the expression not of the individual but of the group. This is clannish
music, tribal music, a racial recollection.
Walk into a pub where a roomful of drinkers are gathered near a table of
fiddles going full tilt, or round a woman singing alone in sad lament and
your tribal brain will recognise it for the old call it is. It will raise
the hairs on the back of your neck and set your blood pumping.
Twenty years ago, Muiris told me, he was spurred to action by the death of
his friend Willie Clancy, then Clare's best known musician. Like other
admirers of things Gaelic, Muiris saw that the old ways were slipping
through their fingers, that knowledge of Irish music was dying with the
passing of each generation. So began the Willie Clancy Summer School, a link
allowing the passing on of music to younger players.
Today it is a school of international repute, drawing 800 advanced musicians
a year to intensive classes, lectures, workshops and recitals in Miltown. In
their wake follow 6,000 enthusiastic non-enrolled musicians and music lovers
who night and day crowd into every pub in town to exchange tunes, pick up
techniques, and enjoy 'the crack' - the good times that flow from music and
beer and Irish conviviality.
When the sun shines, Miltown Malbay makes hay. For the short period the
school is in session the town's bars, shops, restaurants and
bed-and-breakfasts make a handsome turnover. Without the profits generated
by the school, Miltown's economy, less resilient than its musical culture,
would collapse.
If money is in short supply the rest of the year, music is not. On the
evening I spoke to Muiris, I wandered down to Spanish Point, where in a pub
overlooking the sea the Wolfe Tones were giving a concert.
Thirty years ago they were young firebrands, four hot-blooded musical
militants from Dublin who could work a crowd to fever-pitch with republican
songs of British oppression and the glory of Irish martyrdom. Today they are
old firebrands, greying, red-faced, and tending to fat, but still together
and still capable, through their music, of firing the emotions of Irish
history.
During the evening the Wolf Tones missed no chance to denounce, musically,
what between songs they called '200 years of the impoverishment of Ireland
by British government policies'. By the end of the evening, closing with A
Nation Once Again, they had the younger and more athletic section of the
audience swinging, literally, from the rafters.
But Irish music is not made by cabals bent on sentimentalising violence. At
its best it is poetry, and in Clare its inspiration comes less often from
violence than from the gentle world of bog and farm.
On the morning I met him, Junior Crehan told me he began composing songs
simply by listening to the world as he worked around his farm - to the
rhythmic sound of a mowing machine, or the huff of the West Clare Railway in
the distance. Despite his name, Junior has silvery hair, tobacco-stained
fingers and blue eyes that have turned milky with age. At 85 he is the
respected doyen of Clare musicians; his jigs and reels have sent friends
dancing across the great stone flags of his farm-house since the early part
of this century.
Junior apologised for his sleepiness as we talked in his kitchen; the
evening before, in the nearby village of Mallagh, he had played fiddle in
Moroney's Bar with a dozen other musicians until two in the morning. That
was nothing, he said; as a young man he had often played at country house
dances until 7am.
'Some people thought we were crazy,' he said, 'but they knew nothing about
music. It was in our blood. For us it was a religion.'
Perhaps too much so. In the 1930s the Irish clergy, citing immoral behaviour
among the young, pressed for the passage of the Dance Hall Act. It was a
bill which brought the days of the great country dances to an end and
provoked a long decline in traditional music.
Not everything from that period is lost. Traditional Irish music has
undergone a great revival and, says Junior, never looked better than today.
Best of all remain the late-night pub sessions that sometimes begin only
when the blinds are drawn, the front door is locked, and the place appears
closed.
In Friel's, a Miltown pub that is second home to local musicians, no matter
how tough times get, you are likely to hear an impromptu session begin any
time the Guinness begins to flow. If you wait long enough you will see
music, stories and poetry transform themselves as the night draws on from
simple words and notes into some kind of magic.
What I am waiting to see now is the week when a thousand fiddle and pipe
players are let loose in the street of 19 pubs.

FT  26 MAR 94 / How to Spend It: Old idea: new greeting - Keeping up with
the designer age is a challenge. Helen Lowry finds how the card industry is
coping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELEN LOWRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in the age of fax, telephones and communicating computers, there is
still no better - or more popular - way of communication than the greeting
card. According to the Greeting Card and Calendar Association, 2.427m cards
are sold each year in the UK alone.
Greeting cards are keeping pace with our increasingly design-oriented times.
Individual artists, craftsmen, photographers, illustrators and architects
are turning their hand to the art. Cards now display a range of design
techniques and there is a wealth of choice.
According to Christopher Cordingly, of Art Angels Publishers: 'It is a
heavily populated industry in which you have to carve your own niche.' He
looks for a distinctive style and images which have a universal appeal. Lucy
Clibbon is one of four recent art school graduates he has commissioned.
Initially inspired by a postcard made to illustrate her degree show, she now
has a range of 50 cards which are sold worldwide. She uses two techniques,
monoprinting and gesso (primal paint). Her gently humorous designs are full
of detail. 'Hand in Marriage' features a couple in traditional wedding dress
within the outline of a hand.
Surrounding them, and in the fingers, are hearts, champagne glasses, a
wedding cake, and various other objects associated with marriage.
Each Art Angels card is given a title and all are 'blank message' cards.
Improvement in reproduction quality has opened the market to numerous other
professionals.
Emma Tennant specialises in rag-rug making, a traditional craft in the south
of Scotland from where she comes. She describes the craft as 'the flip side
of patchwork'.
Using left-over bits of wool, in particular scrap tweed, she pulls them with
a hook through hessian. First transformed into wrapping paper, the bouncy
texture and vibrant colours are captured equally well in card form. Living
on a farm, Tennant's designs are inspired by looking out of the window.
It is partly the simplicity of her designs - a cat, sheep, pig or flowers -
which gives the cards their charm.
Michael Ashpool, of IMAI Design, also uses a traditional craft, the Japanese
paper-folding art of origami. He regularly makes trips to Japan to buy
'washi', vast sheets of hand-made, silk-screen paper.
He believes that 'an image must be simple and stand out'. His first, and
most popular design, is a miniature representation of the kimono, one of the
most recognisable and colourful of oriental images. His range also includes
a swan and butterfly, and can be bought at The Conran Shop (address below);
The British Museum, Bloomsbury, London WC1; and The Japan Centre,
Piccadilly, W1.
Individual ventures and contemporary designers are only one aspect of the
card market. Galleries and museums, as well as reproducing items from their
collections, are increasingly bringing out ranges to cover special
exhibitions.
The Victoria and Albert Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 2RL, has a large
and varied card selection, ranging from reproductions of William Morris
prints to hand-made cards by young contemporary artists.
They have produced a series of cards following the popular Fornasetti
exhibition. Black and white designs feature the classic Fornasetti woman.
Her smooth and expressionless face forms the head of a light bulb, a sun, or
just her eyes and nose are encompassed in a winding ribbon.
Fornasetti's colour drawings, although blank inside, have 'occasion' themes.
'Paloni', which depicts a sky scattered with hot air balloons, is an ideal
card for someone about to set off on a trip; 'Brindisi', the striking image
of a man and woman's arm crossing in the air, their glasses raised in a
celebratory gesture, could mark an anniversary or engagement.
The Design Museum, Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD, has a small but excellent
selection. Fold-out cards, created by Japanese architect Masahiro Chatani,
depict simple shapes, scenes or buildings. 'Dining Niche', a table and
chairs, captures the intimacy of a dinner. There are three-dimensional
representations of the Taj Mahal, a multi-tiered wedding cake, and an
abstract design entitled 'Blocks'. In contrast to this understated
collection, is a series of cards celebrating product-design throughout
history.
Each card is a bold cut-out. There is, among others, a pop-inspired
Valentine Typewriter, bright red and toy-like; a Predicta Television, one of
the most famous images of post-war industrial design; and a classic 1930s
BMW motor-cycle.
Art Angels cards are available at Liberty of Regent Street, London W1; The
Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3; The General Trading Company, 144
Sloane Street, London SW1; The Medici Gallery, 7 Grafton Street, London W1;
and The Royal College of Art, Kensington Gore, London SW7.
Emma Tennant cards, published by Frederica Freer Greeting Cards, are
available at: The General Trading Company; Graham &amp; Greene, 4 Elgin
Crescent, London W11; The Royal Horticultural Society, Vincent Square,
London SW1; The Chelsea Gardener, 125 Sydney Street, London SW3; Dartington
Cider Press (Devon); The Village Bakery (Cumbria) and the National Trust.

FT  26 MAR 94 / How to Spend It: When in London say 'Chodo ii' - In London's
special Japanese shops, there are no language barriers and they accept yen
</HEADLINE>

It is lunchtime in Hanover Square in central London, and House of Hanover is
crowded with tourists filling their shopping carts with Walkers shortbread,
Wedgwood china and Twinings tea. A saleswoman rushes over to a man who has
wandered toward a rack of Burberrys raincoats. 'Excuse me sir, those coats
are for women,' she says, steering him to the men's side of the department.
'We have many stylish items,' she exclaims. 'They're very cheap.'
Actually, she said something more like: 'Suimasen, sochira wa josei na mono
desu. Kakkoii mono arismasu yo. Yasui desu yo.' For House of Hanover is not
just a run-of-the-mill souvenir shop. Along with several other such stores
in London, many with familiar Japanese department store names, it caters
almost exclusively for Japanese tourists.
Many of the staff in these shops are Japanese, as are 70 to 99 per cent of
their customers. The shops carry largely the same range of typical British
products, but the ethos in the stores is imported from home. At Igirisu-ya,
for example, formal announcements over the shop sound system thank the
shoppers for their patronage in formal Japanese, and bowing clerks murmuring
'Irasshaimase' ('Welcome to our store') can be seen in every department.
Shopping is an essential component of a Japanese trip abroad and according
to the British Tourist Authority, Japanese people regularly list good
shopping as a reason for coming to London. Japanese custom dictates that
travellers must bring back omiage - souvenirs - for everyone.
The Japanese are among the most generous spenders to visit England.
According to British Tourist Authority figures, the Japanese spend 16 per
cent less time in Britain than all other foreign visitors, but part with 37
per cent more money.
Although figures have not been compiled for 1993, the BTA estimates 580,000
visitors travelled to Britain from Japan, spending around Pounds 312m, up 8
per cent from 1992. The number of visitors has grown steadily since 1978.
Three main tour companies, Japan Travel Bureau, Nippon Travel and Miki
Travel, serve about 155,000 tourists a year between them. They deliver
clients to the Japanese shops at the end of half-day bus tours, sometimes
for just 20 frenzied minutes.
For those whose visits are brief - and a two-day stop is common - shopping
must be squeezed in between sightseeing, theatre-going and restaurant
hopping. The special Japanese shops make things easy: there are no language
barriers, they provide VAT refund services (Sogo in Piccadilly automatically
calculates the refund on the sales receipt, and the back of the receipt is a
customs form) and they accept yen for payment.
Many of the goods in the shops, although available in Japan, are as much as
70 per cent cheaper here. But according to Noriko Mogami, assistant manager
at Takashimaya: 'A lot of Japanese have a business-orientated mind and they
know a lot about how much things cost. As soon as they come into the shop
they bring out their calculators and if they think an item is not much
cheaper than it is in Japan, they won't buy it.'
While she spoke a Japanese mother and daughter huddled over a pile of
Ballantyne sweaters, punching the prices into their calculators. 'So Pounds
40 means Y7,000 . . . is that cheaper, do you think?' they murmured.
At House of Hanover, manager Koichi Nagashima said customers were now more
choosy. He said shodo-gai - impulse buying - was rare. 'They used to buy
things just because they were there. Now they are careful to buy what they
want.'
In recent years, Japanese tourists have become less content to jump on a bus
and be led to House of Hanover or Takashimaya.
Mogami said that although Japanese tourists used the speciality shops almost
exclusively 10 to 20 years ago, they are now more aware of other, more
'native' shopping attractions. She said many people were repeat travellers
who 'know where to go and and do not go to Japanese shops any more. They now
go to Sloane Square, Kings Road, Covent Garden and the markets.
'Now we are asked many times how to get to Camden or Portobello so we are
becoming a tourist information centre.'
As more travellers break away from the traditional package tour, shoppers
will branch out in their shopping habits.
Mami Tanaka, a university student, was travelling for nine days in London
with two friends. Although they went on one bus tour, they had been scouting
through Harrods, Marks and Spencer, Selfridge's, Laura Ashley and Liberty.
Staff at many high street shops frequented by Japanese tourists say they
considered them good customers. 'They are very polite,' said Miss Olga
Gasson, a sales clerk on the ladies' rainwear floor at the Burberrys Regent
Street store.
Some 42 per cent of Burberrys' sales come from Japanese tourists, and the
company makes special small sizes for Japanese bodies.
Liberty gives out extra bags to Japanese customers to use as gift wrap.
These stores also cater for Japanese shoppers by placing Japanese speakers
in their most popular outlets. Burberrys has three in its Haymarket store
and two in the Regent Street store.
Liberty on Regent Street employs one Japanese speaker and is teaching
several of its staff who work in the departments where Tana Lawn scarves,
fabrics and bags - very popular among Japanese women - are sold.
One of the most important phrases that staff are taught is 'Chodo ii' -
'That's perfect]'

FT  26 MAR 94 / How to Spend It: There's room for growth in the shaving
market - Ralph Atkins reports from the cutting edge of cosmetics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be fun working as a marketing executive for a fancy cosmetics
company: big budgets; a chance to put the imagination into overdrive and
create new fashions for the workaday to aspire to. Riveting, absolutely
fabulous.
Experts at Chanel, the Paris-based perfumery, have enjoyed preparing for the
May 2 UK relaunch of Pour Monsieur, the range of shaving products dating
from 1955. Their aim, says the glossy artwork, is to revive 'the art of
shaving . . . to a whisker'.
In their terribly a la mode minds are images of traditional, grey-flannelled
English gents, luxuriating on chrome barbers' chairs; of silken-faced chaps
who have rejected 1980s designer stubble and, yet, are sufficiently modern
to be happy with dabbing a little scented moisturiser on their faces.
So journalists, including yours truly from the Financial Times, have been
invited for a complimentary shave at Claridges, a pot of coffee afterwards,
a spiel from fresh-faced, French-speaking mistresses of public relations on
the importance of silicon derivatives to the adhering properties of shaving
cream, and a complimentary package of Pour Monsieur products.
Such stunts are common. The 1990 launch of Chanel's successful L'Egoiste
range - aimed at the mysterious, amorously-inclined male - included slap-up
romantic dinners for fashion writers and spouses (come to think of it, the
life of a fashion writer is pretty fun too, once you swallow the ignominy of
being manipulated by the marketing teams).
Of course, not everyone is taken in. Shaving is, in essence, a chore. No
amount of expensive perfume or imagery is going to remove the drudgery.
There are just three aims of shaving: to be rid of any trace of beard, to
smell nice (particularly to the female of the species) and to avoid bits
lying at the bottom of the sink when your partner next uses the bathroom. If
any cosmetics company could make a product that achieved all three, and sold
it in plain containers, I would buy a vat-full.
So, against such down-to-earth criteria, is the Pour Monsieur promotion all
piffle? I'm not sure if I rave about the barber's shop. Shaving is a
practice reserved for a pre-breakfast scramble to look respectable - a time
when the mind has not yet downloaded communication skills. But it makes a
change to have someone else tending to all the inaccessible places of the
face, and to cleaning the sink afterwards. There is also an art to shaving,
albeit quickly acquired: the use of hot towels to soften the bristle; the
use of the cut-throat razor along the grain of the beard, avoiding major
arteries.
Chanel has its work cut out, however, if it believes it can revive the
generation of Sweeney Todd. So far has demand for a shaving service fallen
that Claridges only trims about four people a week, at Pounds 10 a head.
Rival luxury hotel The Waldorf, though offering a full male hairdressing
salon, does not provide such a service at all.
More obviously, the re-launch of Pour Monsieur is intended to throw off the
product's slightly old-man image and boost sales to chaps willing to pay
Pounds 10.50 for a can of shaving foam or Pounds 21 for a 100ml bottle of
aftershave. To achieve this it has been reformulated - all those extra
silicon derivatives - and repackaged. It is now going to be sold in clouded,
not clear, glass bottles; the grey used for the shaving foam's container is
lighter. Wow.
There is plenty of room for growth; so far Pour Monsieur is only a follicle
on the face of the cosmetics market. Chanel sells six times as much of its
ladies' perfume No 5. But the company must reckon it cannot be too long
before as many men as women care about how they smell.
And in the smell stakes, Pour Monsieur fares well. I thought of trying a
proper consumer test, but a sniff along the shelves of Boots the Chemist
proved the only challengers are the equally expensive products from other
perfume houses. In comparison, standard pre-electric lotion or aftershaves
smell like white spirit. When it comes to the top-notch products, the
differences are a matter of taste. (Incidentally, Claridges uses its own
brand when not running promotions for Chanel.)
Pour Monsieur is described as combining Sicilian lemons, cardamom, oak moss
and Virginian cedar. It is certainly lemony, as in tarte au citron rather
than washing-up liquid. 'Prooooor,' said my wife, but I think she liked it
really.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Jus one of those things - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH and PHILIPPA DAVENPORT

<TEXT>
I have just received the menu from the acclaimed London restaurant
'Aubergine' (11 Park Walk, SW10. Tel: 071-352-3449) and I am perplexed. It
reads like a badly translated tourist menu from the backstreets of
Marseille.
Alright, I am a pedant, but what exactly is 'vinaigrette crustaces' (French
genders are not the strong point of the chef, Scotsman Gordon Ramsay). Why
is it a roasted and not a roast pigeon? Is a 'vinaigrette of vegetables
presse (nor are plurals) a soup, given that the implication is that
everything has been liquidised? 'Girolles', 'beignets', 'pomme' (sic) 'sauce
epices' all have English translations which would be less bewildering.
Pigeon poche grille is presumably 'poche et grille' or 'poached and grilled'
in English?
The most striking thing is the repeated use of the trendy word 'jus'. The
standard French dictionary Petit Robert tells me that this could be 'juice'
in the accepted sense of the word or 'meat/pan juices' in the form of an
unthickened gravy which has not become a sauce. This would explain 'Jus
tarragon', 'jus rosemary', 'thyme' 'Madeira' etc, but not excuse them. Keep
them wholly in French: 'jus parfume au romarin', 'a l'estragon' etc, and be
less eclectic. As for the 'jus Granny Smith' on the creme brulee I suppose
that is plain old apple juice.
Elucidations and examples of similar gobbledegook gratefully received.
The Guild of Food Writers, sponsored this year by restaurateur Nico Ladenis,
has launched the 1994 Jeremy Round Award, to find the best young food
writer.
Entrants, who must be under 25, are invited to write a stimulating,
mouthwatering or witty piece about sausages, in no more than 800 words. The
prize of Pounds 500 will be presented at a luncheon at Nico at Ninety, Park
Lane, London, in mid-June.
Closing date for entries is Friday May 13. Entries should be sent to The
Secretary, The Guild of Food Writers, 27 Lebanon Park, Twickenham, Middlesex
TW1 3DF.
If you plan to be in Cambridgeshire over Easter and are looking for an
outing that will satisfy a variety of tastes, you might aim for Elton, just
off the A605, eight miles west of Peterborough.
For those who cannot resist stately homes, Elton Hall will feed the mind,
and a branch of Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, housed in Elton Hall's old dairy, will
feed the body with west coast seafood. Prices are modest and opening hours
from 9am until 9pm seven days a week.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Well-travelled grapes - Wine / Jancis Robinson
finds striking contrasts between the wineries of the new world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1994 wine harvest is almost over, in the southern hemisphere that is.
Just back from a quick fix of carbon dioxide and grapeskin smells in
Australian and South American wineries, I am haunted by two very different
images of today's wine industry.
In the Yarra Valley outside Melbourne, in the temperature-controlled hangar
that is Moet &amp; Chandon's Australian offshoot winery, a stack of giant metal
bins filled with Pinot Noir grapes wait patiently until Domaine Chandon's
small team of cellar rats, and some extremely shiny equipment, are ready to
press them into a new vintage of Green Point sparkling wine. The 1991 is
yours for Pounds 10.49, up 50p from the 1990 because of spiralling demand.
What makes this sight remarkable is that these tight, healthy bunches of
shiny black grapes were picked four days earlier in the far south of Western
Australia and have been shipped, in a refrigerated truck, across the
notoriously unforgiving Nullabor Plain - the distance equivalent of shipping
grapes from southern Turkey to Bordeaux.
This is the Australian way of doing things - pragmatism unfettered by
tradition, spurred on by a sophisticated market at home and abroad.
A few days later I watched the 1994 vintage being delivered to Penaflor in
Mendoza, Argentina's largest winery. Dozens of magnificently ancient lorries
stood waiting their turn between weighbridge and continuous press, piled
high with a jumble of indigenous Criolla and Cereza grapes, oxidising almost
visibly in the sunshine.
Penaflor boasts the world's largest wine vat, a subterranean concrete
cylinder 10m high and 36m across, carefully painted on the outside to look
like wood. Dinner parties for 500 have been held inside it. More usually it
is filled and emptied every two months - with enough wine to fill almost 7m
bottles, or 5m of the litre cardboard Tetrapaks that are so popular with
South American wine drinkers.
Intrigued, I asked to taste the wine blended in it, Termidor, Argentina's
best selling wine, after being shown the increasingly exciting Trapiche
range that is groomed for export markets in one small corner of the winery.
The white, musky juice of these local grape varieties makes up all of the
white and half of the red Termidor.
I defy a European palate positively to enjoy the flavour of the white, but
the red was respectably coloured and masked by a blend of Tempranillo,
Barbera and Sangiovese (one of California's most sought after grapes at the
moment). Termidor sells for just 1.20 pesos (80p) a litre.
Given the domestic taste for heavy, low-acid, almost-oxidised wines that
would be impossible to sell outside Latin America, and given the antique
nature of most Argentine wine technology, it is a miracle that a dozen or so
winery owners in Argentina are now enthusiastically gearing up for export.
The wine industry is currently one of Argentina's most significant
investment sectors.
The Argentines are several years behind their neighbours across the Andes in
this respect. Stainless steel has become much less of a novelty in Chile
over the past few years, and Chilean wine has an established market for
inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon in the US, UK and other parts of northern
Europe. But the Chileans are all too aware of Argentina's potential as the
world's fifth biggest wine producer.
As Argentines are wont to observe somewhat smugly: 'We're not really
interested in what the Chileans do, but they're always worried about what
we're up to.'
Chilean wine exports slowed last year, but the 1994 harvest is the first
prolific, if slightly cool, one for some time and grape prices have slumped
accordingly. This, coupled with increasing winemaking skills, may help to
win more customers, although the real difficulty is communicating the
quality-not-quantity message across the winemaker-grapegrower divide. (Wine
producers are therefore investing heavily in suitable vineyard land and
Santa Rita, for example, expects to buy in no more than a fifth of its
grapes by 1997.)
Australian wine producers, on the other hand, are in a frenzy of export
activity. Many of the most lauded now send more than half their production
overseas, mainly to Britain but increasingly to Germany and, to a more
limited extent, the US. Sweden is also an avid consumer of Australian wines
shipped there in bulk.
Wine now represents more than half of Australia's exports and it is the
stated goal of its wine industry that exports should be worth ADollars 1bn
(Pounds 480m) by the year 2000. New vineyards are accordingly being
established all over the country, especially in the coolest, most
south-eastern part of South Australia (a state which has yet to enjoy the
phylloxera experience), and in the deep south of Western Australia - no
longer so isolated, it would seem.
The domestic market, a highly sophisticated one in which connoisseurship is
spread both deeply and widely, is increasingly peeved at seeing so many of
Australia's finest wines sailing away from the country's heavily unionised
quays, and prices have been rising as a result. (Australia's first Dollars
100-a-bottle release, Yarra Yering's Merlot 1991, is sold out.)
Grape prices for the 1994 harvest are at an all-time high as producers
jockey to meet demand while new vineyards come into production. Some
'boutique' producers with deep pockets are said to have offered more than
ADollars 2,000 a tonne for premium grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and
Chardonnay.
The interesting development this year is that Shiraz, Australia's Syrah
which has for long been the country's most planted red wine grape and has
been despised for it, is now commanding the same price as Cabernet in many
regions, particularly in parts of Victoria and the Barossa Valley where it
performs particularly well.
Earlier this year Australia signed a bilateral trade agreement with Europe
which formalised its wine labelling, prohibited the use of such terms as
Champagne, Hermitage, and Burgundy in the long term, and ratifed exact
proportions of grape varieties and regions which would be allowed in blends.
In theory, Australian wines should henceforth become more 'European' in
constitution, but there are few signs that Australian winemakers will
abandon their hallmark practice of blending the produce of a palette of wine
regions which may be many hundreds of miles, and styles, apart.
Green Point 1991 is a forward, exuberant, come-hither champagne method wine
selling for Pounds 10.49 at bigger branches of most major chains. Trapiche's
best buys are the Malbec 1990 Pounds 3.49 from Morrisons supermarkets and, a
real humdinger, Medalla 1991 Cabernet Sauvignon Pounds 6.95 from Grape Ideas
of Oxford.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Olwyn and the giant lobsters - Kieran Cooke
risked being brained by a coconut, all in the cause of food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Hitler Ho used to be a regular caller to the late-night radio request
programme in Hong Kong. Wagon Lee, presumably a man with a penchant for the
overnight services of the European railway system, was a columnist on a
local paper.
Names are peculiar things. The gender of my own is often confused - once,
this led to being confined overnight in the women's cabin section of a
Swedish ferry.
So what about the name Olwyn? The very picture of Welsh womanhood.
Healthy-cheeked, leek-eating, daffodil-growing. Wind from the Beacons
blowing through blond hair. Chapel on Sunday evenings. Cardiff Arms Park
with the lads. Dylan Thomas. The Eisteddfod.
Not this Olwyn, though. Olwyn Weerasekara is a man. A native of that magical
but, sadly, strife-filled island of Sri Lanka. He is also keeper of one of
the world's more unusual restaurants.
'I think maybe my father had a Welsh girlfriend once and decided I should
commemorate her,' says Olwyn. The name has never bothered him. He gets on
with what he knows best - cooking and sharing drinks and chat with
customers.
Olwyn's - or the Beach Wadiya restaurant - is on the open-sided
three-wheeler. Turn off the main road going south. Go down a dusty,
pot-holed track towards the sea. Take a left. A few desultory fairy lights
blink in the distance. 'Olwyn's,' says the driver. You stop and make sure
there are no hoots from oncoming locomotives.
The Beach Wadiya is on the other side of the railway tracks, perched on a
strip of sand between the trains and the sea. Levering the flesh out of a
crab claw might be interrupted by the very close rumble of the southern
express.
Olwyn's speciality is lobster. Lots of them. Grilled, poached, fried - with
butter and garlic, with chilli, with curry. Colombo's aficionados ring
beforehand to place their orders. Then, they know they can be sure of
Olwyn's personal touch in the cooking.
Later, being partial to a drink or two, Olwyn tends to be pre-occupied
elsewhere, mainly in the cut and thrust of intellectual conversation at
various tables littered round the sand. 'What is life for but to enjoy a few
fragile moments like this?' he says. The train goes past, making the
restaurant - and life - seem very fragile.
'Of course, people come here for the food, but it's not just that - it's
more for the, how shall I say . . .' His verbal meanderings are interrupted
by a slight hubbub at one table. A coconut has dropped from a tree, nearly
flattening the bald-headed diner underneath.
With commendable sang-froid, Olwyn waves at the rather startled gathering
and tells the waiter to take a jug of the local coconut toddy across.
'Nothing like good, strong toddy for putting the world right,' he says, with
a sharp slap of the thigh and a hearty roar of laughter.
The lobsters arrive. Two of them, stretching across the table. But I am not
allowed to eat. First, I have to examine the weighty books of customers'
comments.
Sample: 'I am from the USA. I have not eaten yet. But look forward to my
prawns. I hope on my next visit I can write in your guest book again and
tell you how good the food was or was not. Regards, RM Schwartz.'
Schwartz has no other entry. Perhaps the prawns were not up to scratch. More
likely, the toddy froze his literary abilities. Or he was brained by a stray
coconut.
I crack a lobster claw, but Olwyn wants to show me the pictures. A group of
very red-faced diners. 'The England cricket team - they all came here and
stayed till very late. We even had some bowling on the beach.'
Perhaps googlies go better with toddy.
'Olwyn, I really must get back to my lobster.'
'All in good time. Life should not be rushed. Now look at these pictures.'
Olwyn is a fan of the late Elvis. So, he had an Elvis lookalike competition
at Beach Wadiya. It was one of the highpoints of the restaurant's existence.
Lobster, toddy and rock-a-hula-baby.
A frisson of excitement runs among the tables. Sri Lanka is playing host to
Miss World Tourism. Several of the girls have found their way to Olwyn's.
Each one of them 6ft tall, most of it legs.
Olwyn jumps like one of his crustaceans on the way to the griddle. 'So
honoured ladies. Of course we have room.'
There is only one table with space. Mine - at present occupied only by two
sadly neglected lobsters.
On one side, Miss Poland. On the other, Miss Latvia.
'Kieran? But that is a girl's name, yes?' says Miss Poland, in a tone that
brooks no contradictory opinion.
'Olwyn?' says Miss Latvia. 'That is a very sweet name. It is a Sri Lankan
name, no?'
Olwyn waves for more toddy. The train goes past. The lobsters do a Fred
Astaire on the table.
'We will eat your lobsters,' says the long legs from Warsaw.
'You are so kind,' says the twinkling Miss Latvia to Olwyn.
Beach Wadiya, 2 Station Avenue, Wellawatte, Sri Lanka. Tel: Colombo 588568.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A pork pie to ponder - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Street foods in Britain are not what they were. Where is the gingerbread
man? Where are the sellers of ripe cherries and hot warden pears? Where is
the bell-ringing travelling pieman? All we hear now is the megaphoned tinkle
of Teddy Bears' Picnic as Mr Whippy vans cruise the housing estates.
In some rural areas mobile fish and chip kitchens splutter from village to
village. In cities the stench of over-stewed onions belches from hamburger
stands. Only as Christmas approaches do things improve when the chestnut
vendors take over.
Pies were once the most popular of all street foods and piemen were familiar
figures with their trayloads of wares. Fillings of mutton, beef, eel, and
fresh fruits in season were relished. Pork pies, however, were always hot
favourites.
Recipes for pork pies abound. Strong regional tastes are evident and there
are some very localised versions indeed, particularly in the hunting shires
where the wisdom of carrying a good pie in your saddlebag (and a hip flask)
was well understood. Just the ticket to sustain an energetic sportsman all
day - or to comfort an unseated rider ditched by his steed.
Melton Mowbray pork pies are still famous, spiced with anchovy and cayenne.
Nutmeg and allspice were favoured elsewhere, and herbs such as thyme,
parsley and sage in other places. In some areas the addition of apples,
onions and/or cheese was favoured. Elsewhere the inclusion of eggs, chicken
or veal was preferred.
Some of the pork pies made and sold in earlier centuries were probably as
dire or worse than the sawdust-dreary, mechanically recovered meat pies that
late 20th century publicans microwave for their customers. But the best must
have been very good indeed with their thick and decorative pastry casing and
their filling of succulent, flavoursome meat.
The pie crust frills that now flute our collars and cuffs began life as
pastry decorations of course. And the flesh of large, free-ranging,
long-lived pigs is unquestionably superior to that of juvenile runts factory
farmed by producers obsessed with low-fat meat.
PORK &amp; PIPPIN PIES (serves 6-8)
These can be served hot or cold and would make a good choice for Easter
picnics. I have used lean end of belly of pork - partly for economy but
mostly because of the rich texture it gives the gravy. Hannah Glasse,
writing in 1747, recommended a more refined version of the pies using small
steaks cut from a loin of pork, white wine instead of vinegared water, and
no onion. Loin, being more tender and drier, needs no pre-cooking before
baking.
For the filling: 3 lb lean end belly of pork or 2 1/4 lb thick boneless
slices of belly of pork (in other words enough belly to yield 1 1/2 lb pork
after bones and rind are removed); 6oz onion; 9oz sharp aromatic apple
(Braeburn from New Zealand make the best choice at this time of year); a
little butter; freshly grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoon tarragon or white wine
vinegar mixed with 1 tablespoon soft brown sugar and 4 1/2 fl oz cold water.
For the crust: 6oz wholewheat flour; 6oz plain white household flour; 3oz
butter; 3oz lard; beaten egg to seal and glaze.
Bone the pork, if not already done, de-rind it and cube the meat. Chop the
onion finely. Peel, core and chop the apple. Put all three ingredients into
a lightly buttered casserole. Season with salt, pepper and plenty of nutmeg
and pour on the vinegared and sweetened water. Lay the pork rinds on top and
cover with a well fitting lid. Cook at 300`F (150`C) gas mark 3 for 2 1/2
hours.
Discard the rinds, letting the juices drip back into the casserole. Check
seasoning and set aside until cold.
Make the pastry, seasoning it well. Use half to two-thirds of it to line the
base and sides of two 6 1/2 in-7in springclip cake tins or two small oval
pie dishes.
Divide the pie filling between the pastry-lined containers and cover with
lids rolled out from the remaining pastry. (NB: if using pie dishes, do not
lay the pastry on the rim of the dish in the usual way but seal the pastry
sides and lid with an upward movement to make a frilly collar, as though
making a raised pie.)
Glaze the pies with beaten egg and make steam holes. Bake on a pre-heated
baking sheet for 15 minutes at 425`F (220`C) gas mark 7, then at 325`F
(160`C) gas mark 3 for 1 1/2 hours.
Let the cooked pies rest for at least 5 minutes between baking and serving
if they are to be eaten hot. Better still, serve them cold when they can be
cut into jellied wedges.

MEAN HIGH TIDE by James Hall Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 340 pages
THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD by Lawrence Block Orion Pounds 15.99, 361 pages
SACRED CLOWNS by Tony Hillerman Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 284 pages
The great novelist of modern-day Florida is John D MacDonald; the word
thriller is inadequate. He died eight years ago but his principal creation,
Travis McGee, lives on.
There were 21 Travis McGee stories and they have become classics of popular
fiction because MacDonald had an idea of genius, to translate the Arthurian
knight of medieval chivalry to 20th-century America. Travis McGee is
therefore much more than a bronzed and battered middle-aged beach bum; he is
more, and more interesting, than the routine private eye: he is an
archetypal Hero.
But John D MacDonald is also important because he is the master of the
Florida School which today promises to dominate American crime fiction. Carl
Hiaasen is one of the newer and most successful members, a Miami journalist
with a wild satirical humour. James Hall is another, and is clearly pitching
to be MacDonald's heir. What they all share is an obsessive rage about the
rampant commercial over-development which is rapidly destroying their
Florida. But their books are more than 'eco-thrillers'.
James Hall's Mean High Tide is his fifth novel. Like McGee, his reclusive
drop out hero Thorn is bronzed, battered, middle-aged, etc., with a similar
taste for sea and sun and sex and a hatred of bureaucrats and businessmen.
The same characters and locations crop up. Thorn's girl is murdered (he has
a habit of losing the women in his life). There is a maniac with a loopy
daughter and a plan to breed red tilapia (that's a fish]) which will destroy
the ecological balance of the region. Hall's world is very violent, his
villains are very villainous, and the sex is more explicit than MacDonald,
the old-fashioned romantic, would have sanctioned, but he can write almost
as well as his master and the dialogue is as strong as Elmore Leonard's.
What he does not have - and may not understand - is the universality of
McGee, the knight in not-so-shining armour.
Mandarin have just re-issued Under Cover of Daylight, Squall Line and Hard
Aground (not about Thorn) in paperback. Start with the first.
Far to the north, in the differently-polluted streets of New York, Lawrence
Block is bidding to be the eventual heir of Robert Parker. The American hero
these days has to be a credible, fallible human being - a resurrected James
Bond wouldn't stand a chance - and, in these enlightened times, it helps if
he has a long-running Relationship with a real live woman, not a succession
of bimbos.
Block's triumph is Scudder, the ex-cop and alcoholic who seems to spend a
lot of his books either in an AA meeting or sipping club soda in Irish bars.
The girlfriend, Elaine, is an East Side call-girl. Again, they are both in
early middle-age and, despite their lurid background, they both turn out to
be interesting and credible people.
The Scudder books have been slow to cross the Atlantic. A Ticket to the
Boneyard, just re-issued by Orion in paperback, was a terrifying and
brilliantly successful story of their being terrorised by a psychotic
murderer. The Devil Knows You're Dead takes us into slightly quieter waters,
starting with the motiveless murder of a yuppie lawyer on Eleventh Avenue.
Block has the confidence to take his plot slowly and to build in a serious
novelist's consideration of themes that lesser crime writers steer clear of
 -the justification of suicide, for example. His underworld is convincing
and alarming; he has that vital page-turning compulsion; he deserves all the
plaudits.
Tony Hillerman is an authority on the Navajos who had the fascinating idea
of setting a crime series in today's Indian territory. His double-act of
Lieutenant Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police is
cleverly balanced: Leaphorn is widowed and wise, Chee wants to become a
shaman as well as a good cop, which offers all sorts of tensions for a
novelist. To my mind Sacred Clowns, which has even more anthropological
business than usual, is a bit flat, but it will no doubt satisfy the
devotees.

ELDEST SON: ZHOU EN-LAI AND THE MAKING OF MODERN CHINA 1898-1976 by Han
Suyin Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 283 pages
During the decade of China's Holocaust, the Cultural Revolution, premier
Zhou En-lai drew up a Schindler's list of those he wanted to protect from
the forces of death and destruction. His main Ark was Peking's Hospital 301,
to which he had healthy targets of the Red Guards' wrath confined. The
numbers he protected were few but today he is chiefly remembered with
affection in China because of these efforts and his desperate work to keep
the nation afloat in the chaotic seas, in reward for which his master,
Chairman Mao Zedung, labelled him China's 'housekeeper.'
One would have thought that, after the chorus of contempt which greeted her
two-volume hagiography of Mao, The Morning Deluge and Wind in the Tower, an
instinct for self-preservation if not a sense of shame would have inhibited
Han Suyin from attempting a biography of Zhou En-lai. Mao's faithful prime
minister spent the last years of his life fighting cancer and vainly trying
to limit the damage inspired by the senile monomaniac Chairman, his
termagant wife and the Gang of Four.
The Mao volumes ludicrously presented the Chairman, to quote from the blurbs
on their dust-jackets, as 'a modest man and, moreover, a man merciful to his
enemies, uncorrupted by power,' a judgment at odds both with historical
truth and with any intellectual honesty. Mao had qualities as a thinker and
a charismatic revolutionary still acknowledged in China, but as a disastrous
peace-time leader he was a monstrous egoist and a ruthless tyrant.
In writing this gushing tribute to Zhou, Han Suyin does her best to do
justice to the bitter struggles of his last years while avoiding flat
contradictions of her own deification of Mao. But, despite endless evasions,
prettification and an insistent incantatory prose style, she fails by a long
chalk to bring it off.
The introductory paragraphs set the tone: 'Beloved Premier Zhou.
Automatically, so many of my generation spoke of him thus, running the words
together. . . Somehow because of him we all felt life was worth living . . .
' By the final chapters Han Suyin has transmuted this dedicated Marxist
revolutionary into a Confucian gentleman and ends apotheosising him as a
Christ-like figure, dying painfully for millions on the cross of Mao's
Cultural Revolution.
Like certain other lady novelists, she reproduces the thoughts of others as
history. She presumes that Zhou's reaction to his betrayal by friends was
'grief unspoken, swallowed down, invisible,' and records the reaction of the
audience to one of his last appearances: ''He is back, he is back,' one
could hear the thought from every brain, though not a word was said.' Han
Suyin bids fair for the title of being the Barbara Cartland of China
Watchers.
The writer ignores or plays down facts which fit uneasily into her theme
that both Mao and Zhou were benign, if occasionally fallible, heroic figures
and their enemies evil. The death of Liu Shaoqi, the main target of the
Cultural Revolution, occurs with no mention of the cruelty that killed him,
medicine-less on the floor of a freezing cell.
She does record that Mao never bothered to visit his premier on his deathbed
but reports that his nurse claimed that she saw 'tears running down his
face' while he watched evening television on the day Zhou died  - an
unlikely tale. Better sourced is that a coarse poem by Mao ('Don't fart or
the heavens will be turned upside down'), was read to the dying Zhou, who
wept before he died. Mao did not attend the funeral ceremony, an absence Han
Suyin does not note.
Zhou was, of course, a very considerable leader of great charm which I have
seen him use to enormous effect while manipulating a roomful of foreign
journalists. Evidently, he employed it on the author. Zhou used his charm
and intelligence to rule, dominate, persuade, cajole and, in the end, to
survive. Back in 1928, Zhou had said, 'For the sake of the Revolution, we
must even become like a prostitute.' That turned out to be his fate.
In the final analysis, Zhou who preached common sense, died a failure in the
shadow of a chaos-sowing Monkey King figure. He had given his life to a lost
cause, but is remembered with affection because of the few dozens he rescued
from the spite of the man who embodied that cause. Under the billows of Han
Suyin's romantic prose, Zhou's very real qualities disappear. His portrait
is painted in the literary equivalent of China's revolutionary art: a
saint-like, heroic-eyed worker gazing towards the rays of the sun of Mao.

PAYING THE PIPER by Sir Alan Peacock EUP Pounds 30.50, Pounds 12.50 pb, 168
pages
This is a fascinating book, filled with tables of statistics and musical
anecdotes. If the two sound incompatible, that chimes with the career and
character of the author. He describes leaving a cheerful lunch whilst Chief
Economic Adviser to the DTI. On hearing a two-note fanfare of minor thirds
uttered by a passing ambulance, he competes with his host in identifying 12
other themes that begin with minor thirds - from 'Colonel Bogey' to the
Quartet from the first act of Fidelio. A rare competition for a mandarin.
The centre-piece of the book is the Orchestral Resources Enquiry of 1969-70.
Sir Alan Peacock, on the basis of his polymath knowledge of music and
free-market economics, was commissioned by Lord Goodman, then chairman of
the Arts Council of Great Britain, to head the enquiry. His committee, full
of maestri, listened to a dialogue of the deaf orchestra managers who damned
modern composers; composers who regarded the audience as necessary for
acoustic reasons only; conductors who thought the orchestra was becoming a
museum piece.
The enquiry produced two particularly controversial recommendations:
earnings in regional orchestras were to be raised to the same level as those
for London; and direct subsidies were to be given to only two out of the
four London orchestras. Peacock describes with relish how the main
recommendations were thrown out by the Arts Council even in advance of
publication.
How familiar it all sounds, a generation later and not long after Peter
Palumbo and Anthony Everitt bit the dust following similar attempts to
reform the organisation and subsidies of the London orchestras]
Peacock, though, is not a man given to falling on his sword. He went on to
become a member of the Arts Council himself and chairman of the Scottish
Arts Council. He compiles a delicious fantasy of complaints from
dissatisfied Scottish arts organisations: 'Take Glasgow-based clients.
They're a funny lot. Some don't make moan at all and seem almost trusting,
and others write you polished letters which you know mean the Glasgae
equivalent of 'A'll smash yer face in'. Edinburgh is different; very sniffy
letters with postscripts like 'I would have you know that my Chairman is the
brother-in-law of the Secretary of State's cook' - menacing words presaging
a sleepless night for me.'
He goes on to describe his vain attempts to design a policy that would
eventually have put the Arts Councils out of business and helped the arts to
become largely self-supporting: a triumph of hope over experience.
He had a few successes - for example his Young Scots' Card that gave young
people discounts to Art Centres all over Scotland and that he saw as a
preliminary to vouchers entitling consumers to reductions in the price of
cultural goods chosen from an Arts Council list. He wished to see public
perception of the arts translated into the power of the consumer to choose
which art-form to support.
There is a gentler side to Peacock's cultural economics. He quotes with
approval the comment of two American professors that, 'few of us are willing
to take the responsibility of passing on to future generations a country
whose beauty has been destroyed'. I suspect that this romanticism underlies
the apparent harshness of much of Peacock's free-market approach.
Peacock has a capacity for irritating experts. The forthrightness of his
views and his natural iconoclasm are evident in Paying the Piper, which is
compulsory reading for anyone entering the field of arts sponsorship. I
trust Lord Gowrie will buy a copy and keep it under this pillow when he
inherits, upon April Fool's Day, the mantle of Lords Goodman and Palumbo at
the Arts Council. It will help him succeed.

is all very well but there is a limit

<TEXT>
SEVEN EXPERIMENTS THAT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD by Rupert Sheldrake Fourth
Estate Pounds 15.99, 269 pages
Open-mindedness is an intellectual virtue. History is cluttered with the
wrecks of grand theories which died of dogmatism. Unless we remain alert to
the possibility that our beliefs are false, however well they seem to work,
we might miss opportunities to learn; for the world is stranger than we
think, and our ignorance far outstrips our knowledge.
Such reflections prompt people like Rupert Sheldrake to venture what might
be called 'alternative science'. This consists in devising unorthodox
solutions to problems which orthodox science cannot solve. It also includes
taking seriously the beliefs of children, mystics and stone-age people, on
the grounds that modern science has forced us to shed much wisdom by its
reductively piecemeal approach.
Sheldrake offers us alternative science as thus conceived. He suggests
experiments on the psychic faculties of pets, the homing ability of pigeons,
and the organisation of termite colonies, to test whether his favourite
notion, that of a 'field', will explain their behaviour. Sheldrake
hypothesises that everything is surrounded by fields which transmit
influences and information, and which link creatures to others of their kind
and their homes. The experiments he proposes are intended to test whether
such fields exist.
Sheldrake offers the same solution to other puzzles, like 'phantom limbs' as
sensed by amputees, and the experience of feeling that one is being watched.
He claims that both can be elucidated by postulating that our minds are
fields 'reaching out through the senses, projecting far beyond the surface
of the body.'
But Sheldrake does not confine himself to suggesting explanations for
puzzles. He also mounts an attack on orthodox science for not taking
alternative suggestions seriously. Scientists, he says, are 'the servants of
military and commercial interests'. Their objectivity as enquirers is an
illusion; some falsify their results to get fame. Their minds are closed
against anything unusual because orthodoxy blinds them. They define the
speed of light and gravitational attraction as constant values, whereas
these values in fact fluctuate, showing that chaos or at least radical
changefulness is more truly characteristic of the universe.
Such are Sheldrake's views; and they amount to a farrago of shallowly and
sloppily argued nonsense. The key notion of a 'field' is left unexplained,
usefully for Sheldrake because the vaguer a notion is, the more it explains;
the most we are told is that fields 'resemble elastic bands'. His account of
perception, as quoted, is that mind 'reaches out through the senses', which,
he approvingly notes, is what uneducated folk like children and cavemen
believe. He quotes bizarre anecdotes as evidence; the field explanation of
phantom limbs is demonstrated by the case of a man who kept his amputated
finger in a jar in the basement, and found that when his phantom finger felt
chilly it was because the basement was cold.
Such stuff speaks for itself. The best example of Sheldrake's logic is his
claim that the speed of light varies, based on the fact that investigations
have yielded varying values. Naively assuming that each measurement was
accurate, he takes this to prove his point. It seems to have escaped him
that different measuring techniques, equipment, mistakes or other factors
might explain the differences.
Attacks on scientific scepticism are standard among alternative theorists.
They fail to recognise this as one of science's strengths. They take its
disdain of their hypothesisings as proof of a conspiracy to conceal the
truth. Books like Sheldrake's, therefore, demonstrate why scientific
scepticism is absolutely necessary.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Perfect poems, poor lives - Anthony Curtis on the
French poets Baudelaire and Mallarme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAUDELAIRE by Joanna Richardson John Murray Pounds 30, 602 pages
MALLARME: A THROW OF THE DICE by Gordon Millan Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 30,
389 pages
Yeats said 'The intellect of man is forced to choose, perfection of the
life, or of the work'. Never can that dilemma have appeared with greater
clarity than it does in the lives of the two French poets, Baudelaire and
Mallarme, of whom new biographies have just appeared. Both of them sought
ceaselessly for perfection, and in many of their poems actually achieved it.
Between them they are largely responsible for the modern notion of formal
perfection as a poetic ideal. It was their disciplined response to the
interminable flood of verse that poured out of a Victor Hugo or a Tennyson.
Ironically it was the last of the fluent Victorians - Swinburne - who was
the first English poet to hail Baudelaire's genius - in an article in The
Spectator in 1862. Since then almost every major English poet, starting with
Yeats, Eliot and Auden, has paid tribute to Baudelaire as the founding
father of modernism.
The ideal of perfection helps to explain what we find most puzzling about
Baudelaire and Mallarme, their veneration for the work of Edgar Allen Poe.
Baudelaire's admiration for Poe verged on idolatry; he translated much of
Poe into French, one of the few things that brought Baudelaire some regular
income. Though Baudelaire was by far the greater poet, it was Poe's writings
on poetic technique and theory as well as the morbidity of his
subject-matter that fertilised the mind of Baudelaire. The seeds of the
Frenchman's notion of correspondence - involving a synthesis through words
of all the arts, music, dance, painting, literature - the bedrock of
symbolism, may be found in Poe.
But, as emerges from Joanna Richardson's massive new life of Baudelaire,
there were also remarkable parallels between his life and that of Poe. Both
lost their natural fathers when they were little; both became
mother-fixated; both had adoptive fathers of a military cast who despised
poetry; both adored women but found straightforward sex impossible; both
became chronic invalids; both were invariably in debt.
The last full biography of Baudelaire was by Enid Starkie in 1957. If her
scholarship could at times be faulted, Starkie was always an enthusiast and
she presented a Baudelaire redeemed by her admiration for his work. With
much fresh material at her disposal, Richardson gives us a remorseless march
of all the grim facts, concentrating on the poet's disastrous financial
situation. From his improvident youth to his death aged 46 it never
improved.
What makes it so heart-rending is that his degradation could easily have
been avoided. Baudelaire inherited a sizeable fortune at the age of 21.
Prudently managed he could have lived off it - supplemented by his small
literary earnings - in comfort and dignity for the rest of his life. Within
a few years he had got through half of it, and had burdened himself with
supporting a mulatto mistress Jeanne Duval - the Black Venus of his poetry -
from whom he caught the syphilis that ultimately resulted in the aphasia
(loss of the faculty of speech) that caused him to spend his last years as a
virtual mute.
General Jacques Aupick, the epitome of careerist respectability in the
Second Empire, called a family council to decide what to do about his
prodigal stepson. It was decided that Baudelaire's remaining capital should
be administered by a conseil judicaire allowing him a small annual income.
Baudelaire's stormy relations with his administrator, a family friend who
kept very tight control of the purse-strings, provide an element of pathetic
comedy in the sad story.
Apart from Jeanne Duval, two other women captured his heart - Apollonie
Sabatier, the white Venus who looked like one of Rubens models and who
inspired many of les Fleurs; and the actress Marie Daubrun, who was the
inspiration behind 'le Beau Navire' and 'L'Invitation au Voyage'. Baudelaire
competed for their favours among many gifted men. With the former he
triumphed to the point where she finally confessed her love for him. The
saddest episode of all is his inexplicable failure to turn this dream of a
perfect love into a reality.
Mallarme was one of the earliest of the younger French poets to recognise
Baudelaire's poetic mastery. His own life, freshly told by Gordon Millan,
professor of French Studies at Strathclyde University, was not quite such a
mess, though he too suffered from continual financial constraint. He made a
stable marriage, fathered a daughter who became his literary executor, and
acquired a reputation in his lifetime. But his work as a provincial
schoolmaster, irksome from the start, became intolerable as his poetic gift
developed.
Somehow he managed to get a posting to Paris where his house became a forum
of abstruse poetic speculation. His regular Tuesday evening gatherings were
attended by many artists and writers including the young Paul Valery, his
most gifted disciple. They were in no doubt about Baudelaire's genius and
they developed his theory of correspondence. Some of Mallarme's abstruse
poems and sonnets, always popular with English readers, exemplify it.
At least one of his longer works - 'L'Apres midi d'une Faune' - found a
perfect musical correspondence in the mind of Debussy - and after that in
the work of choreographers and dancers, Nijinsky, Lifar, Arthur Mitchell.
Millan's book reveals the slow evolution of the original poem. He
demonstrates the contrast between the poet's tormented, precarious existence
and the radiant purity of his vision. That indeed is the message of both
these books.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Inspired by Picasso - Brian Sewell discusses Golding
on modernism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VISIONS OF THE MODERN by John Golding Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 28,368 pages
What in art is modern now? It is unlikely that in the last decade of the
Quattrocento, with the Italian Renaissance half done, educated Florentines
still spoke in awe of Masaccio, Donatello and Fra Angelico as modern, yet in
the last decade of this century, John Golding, distinguished art historian,
curator of exhibitions and a painter of sorts, offers us as modern, Picasso,
Matisse, Braque, more Picasso, Duchamp, Gorky, Malevitch, Brancusi and more
Picasso still, all firmly rooted in the first decade. Readers hoping for a
helping hand with Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread will find none offered
here.
Only with Frank Stella and himself does Golding venture into the present day
 -but Stella he treats exclusively as a fellow lecturer and writer, and of
Golding the painter of flaccid abstracts of footnote inconsequence, we must
ask how it is that, revealing so sharp an eye and such honest judgment in
his discussion of the old masters of this century, he can be so blind to the
poverty of his own paintings, daubs that seem merely private therapy for a
man far better employed in intellectual pursuits.
For 40 years Golding has steeped himself in the study of Picasso. The
obsession began with his doctoral thesis on Cubism, and its present
incarnation is the exhibition at the Tate Gallery; its rich fruit is a
scholarly and intuitive knowledge not only of all the artists involved with
Picasso - Braque, Leger et al - or with whom he was in rivalry - Matisse -
but of the critics and apologists who offered him support, of Tsara, Eluard
and Apollinaire. The first essay in the book is indeed on Apollinaire, the
wise, witty and misguided mountebank and showman of Parisian criticism until
his death in 1918, whom Golding accuses of inventing 'the sort of
pseudo-metaphysical jargon that is found all too frequently in writings
about present day art.'
Golding cannot himself be accused of jargon; he writes with utter clarity,
and only a scholar of transparent honesty could observe of Cubist pictures
after a lifetime's work that 'I have come increasingly to realise that I do
not really understand them, and I am not sure that anyone else does either,'
which tempts the sceptic to quote Sickert - 'Painting that requires literary
explanation stands self-condemned. Here we have the condemnation of Matisse
and Picasso, and even of most of Cezanne's canvases.'
Golding may protest inadequacy, but his commentaries on the parallels
between Braque and Picasso in their Cubist years, on the great 'Demoiselles
d'Avignon', on the flowering of Gris and Leger, are passionate in their
sympathy, and illuminate with such uncanny clarity that ordinary mortals may
well feel that they at last understand, even if their mentor does not.
By far the longest essay is devoted to Duchamp, keyed to his mysterious,
unfinished and shattered work on glass, 'The Bride stripped bare by her
Bachelors', damaged in transit in 1926. Amid dense argument, Golding admits
to unanswerable questions and a labyrinth of ideas from which no thread
leads; 'there is no solution, because there is no problem,' claimed Duchamp
 -but there is a problem, and in failing to arrive at its solution, Golding
surveys the whole work of the old mischief-maker, from Mr Mutt's upturned
urinal to the almost posthumous tableau mort of the naked waxwork woman with
her legs spread wide, seeing a cerebral kinship in the wild diversity of
style.
Golding writes at a still slower pace and with emotion cooled when he treats
of Gorky, Malevitch and Brancusi, as though the material has been prepared
for tutorials and has adapted uneasily into literary prose - even the death
of Brancusi's beloved bitch brings scarcely a spark of life to that essay,
and the plodding art historian swamps the connoisseur. Though they are not
without merit, the inclusion of such lectures and reviews (if these are
indeed what they are) blurs the focus of the book, and at the very end it is
blurred still further by the vain inclusion of himself as painter, keeping
company far too distinguished. Golding's eye is at its brightest and his pen
most passionate when Picasso is his inspiration.

Joan's story

JOAN'S BOOK by Joan Littlewood Methuen Pounds 20, 796 pages
I have read a great deal of this remarkable book on trains to and from
rehearsals and I have been constantly leaping up, leaving hat, coat or
script, having nearly missed my stop. But I have never let go of Joan's
Book. It is certainly not well-written; there are few phrases where I would
want to go back and look again for resonances and encapsulations. But this
story of one of the most significant and exciting theatre companies ever,
the Theatre Workshop, is also a profoundly personal memoir of astounding,
tragic and comic times.
Joan Littlewood seems, like an actress, to re-inhabit herself each time. The
childhood chapters read like a best-girl-in-the-class essay on 'My Family'.
Adolescence is hoydenish, self-important and self-glorifying. The account of
her first schoolgirl production (she also played Macbeth), in which she went
too far for the Mother Superior, is joyful. The headmistress hurtled
backstage to tell the company to calm it down a bit. 'Which they did, to my
chagrin.' The early professional life in Manchester is as rich as steak and
cow-heel pie.
She seems to meet everybody, from Laban (she does not convincingly explain
how the great dance and movement annotater happens to be in Manchester at
the time) to Nye Bevan, who tells her the company should be playing to the
miners, which she then does.
Her account of Ewan McColl's marriage proposal on the tram, which develops
into so violent an altercation that the driver stops, as vigorous and moving
as the tender, muddled love she comes to share with Gerry Raffles. Once or
twice you glimpse her ruthlessness, as when she lets it be known that the
company is disbanding, in order to get rid of an old actor for whom she has
no further use. She may have a conscience, but l do not think so.
Compassion, yes. Her description of friendships forged in Czechoslovakia and
then broken as the company leaves the Stalinized Socialist Republic is
almost unbearably moving.
Think about the authors who went through her treadmill at the Theatre Royal
in Stratford, East London, and altered our perception of modern drama:
Brendan Behan and Shelagh Delaney among them. The account of the creation of
Oh what a Lovely War tells you all you need to know about story telling, and
also, by implication, why the film is so dull. And her demolition-jobs on
the Great and Good are meat and drink to jobbing artists. In Tunisia,
helping to organise a makeshift drama festival, she intercepts a
newly-arrived Peter Brook: 'I warned him against introducing any of his
old-hat ideas.' Later, Brook eats a sheep's eye at a dinner, and she is
convinced it is to get back at her.
You do not have to be even half way interested in theatre to relish this
welter of a book. It is compulsive, elusive and maddening. Read it. It is an
un-literary masterpiece.
Playwright Henry Livings is a former member of the Theatre Workshop. His new
translation of Blood Wedding opened this week at the Bolton Octagon.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Stag sets off bull market - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A painting of a stag, roaring his defiance atop a Highland crag, sold for
Pounds 793,500 at Christie's yesterday. It was painted, of course, by
Landseer and wowed the Summer Show at the Royal Academy in 1857. It is
reckoned to be only exceeded in majesty by his 'Monarch of the Glen',
painted six years earlier. The price was lower than expected but it was a
record for Landseer and demand for such very British pictures is basically
confined to the UK.
With only a small leap of the imagination Landseer's stag can represent the
art market seeing off the recession. For things have undoubtedly improved
over the last few weeks. Pictures are luxuries rather than antique
essentials, like tables and chairs. They suffered most during the art market
slump of the last four years. Now the dam of frustrated demand has broken.
In the sale of Victorian pictures an early historical work by Alma-Tadema,
showing the children of Clovis being educated in murder, sold for Pounds
133,500, and a portrait of Lord Tennyson by Watts, which had previously
failed to sell, made Pounds 45,500. This was a good example of the auction
houses persuading sellers to lower reserves, and then placing cautious
estimates on the pictures to tempt back buyers. In November 1992 the Watts
was estimated at Pounds 60,00-Pounds 80,000; yesterday it was marked down to
a realistic Pounds 40,000-Pounds 60,000.
The great breakthrough sale was on March 11 when Christie's sold 93 per cent
by value of its auction of modern British paintings, a sector which had been
badly battered in the early 1990s. A painting by Harold Gilman, a leading
member of the Camden Town School, of his landlady in her bleak room, soared
to a record Pounds 111,500, as against its recessionary Pounds 30,000 top
estimate, while the ever popular wildlife artist David Sheppard hit a new
high of Pounds 40,000 for 'Buffalo Disturbed', as against a Pounds 10,000
top estimate. Throw in a Munnings 'Field of Poppies' for Pounds 128,000
(compared with the Pounds 25,000 forecast) and you have an auction which was
the best for years. According to specialist Jonathan Horwich 'prices are now
back to 1989 levels', the peak of the market before the fall.
This week Sotheby's sold almost 79 per cent by value of its second division
Impressionists, with Picasso pots in demand; 73 per cent of its modern
British; and almost 90 per cent of its contemporary art, always a tricky
area.
Things seem set to continue to improve. Sotheby's is offering four major
paintings in its key sale on June 28, paintings which sellers would not
willingly have put on the market in recent years. All have been locked away
in collections for generations and should greatly appeal to museums and
discriminating collectors. The day of the flashy painting is temporarily
over.
The most art historically interesting is Manet's only completed oil sketch
for his masterpiece 'Bar at the Folies Bergere', in the Courtauld.
Underneath that most famous of Impressionist paintings, is this composition,
the original version. The Pounds 3m estimate seems modest. Also on offer is
a Monet painting from his poplar series, also expected to make Pounds 3m,
and a portrait by Frederic Bazille, whose promising career was cut short in
the Franco-Prussian War when he was 29. Finally a Picasso pastel of 1901, as
pretty a portrait of a woman as you could wish for, is enticingly estimated
at Pounds 600,000-Pounds 800,000.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Sleight-of-hand show - New York is entranced by Ricky
Jay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who place magic shows in the category of cheap and tawdry diversions
are likely to have their minds changed by Ricky Jay. An astonishingly gifted
sleight-of-hand artist and a raconteur supreme, Jay is currently providing a
sophisticated evening's entertainment at New York's Second Stage Theatre,
for those crafty enough to locate a ticket. Called Ricky Jay and his 52
Assistants, the sold-out show is directed by playwright David Mamet and is
the toast of the city; Madonna, Lauren Bacall, Barbara Hershey, and Jerome
Robbins were all in attendance at one recent performance.
Producers have tried to lure Jay to a larger theatre than the tiny Second
Stage, but he has wisely refused. The key to the show is its intimacy. Jay
gives the impression that he has invited friends into his living room
(actually, Kevin Rigdon's woodpanelled set) to show them his best tricks,
and even those in the back row are close enough to be truly flummoxed by his
skills.
A bearded bear of a man, Jay performs alone: the assistants, if you have not
worked it out yet, are his deck of cards, with which he does the most
amazing things. As he shuffles and deals, cards appear where they certainly
could not be and disappear as quickly. Dupes from the audience get trounced
at poker, '21', and that favourite of New York hucksters, three card monte.
Jay constantly plays with the audiences' minds, pretending to bobble the
gags, and then revealing he was in control all along (whoops] dealt someone
three aces? Good thing he saved himself a royal flush])
This is mindboggling, to be sure, but what takes the show a level higher is
Jay's urbane, self-effacing manner and his witty patter. He talks a blue
streak throughout, which not only provides the necessary distraction from
his hands, forever fidgeting with the deck, but gives us a fascinating
history of deception and magic. Jay is the author of several books on the
subject, editor of a quarterly Journal of Anomalies, and is the darling of
magic enthusiasts like Mamet, who has cast Jay in several of his films.
In the second act, the show gets proppier, and to my mind weaker; his
deceptions are at their least convincing during the cups-and-balls tricks
and the prank with an old-fashioned automaton. Jay is at his best with a
deck of cards in his hand, even when he is just tossing the cards around, as
he does at the show's end. But what tossing] He makes cards spin back to him
like boomerangs; he flings them across the room, decapitating a toy duck,
setting a menagerie of stuffed toys to clanging their cymbals, and
penetrating the 'outer pachydermal layer' (the green bit) of a watermelon
after nearly a dozen attempts ('the ricochet,' he warns, 'once killed a man
in Tierra del Fuego').
Jay's show is a playground for adults, sending even the most jaded audience
members into a state of childlike wonder. He does not so much require that
we suspend our disbelief as make it disappear - yes, like magic.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: A hard act to follow - It is almost exactly a year
since Jacques Toubon took over from Jack Lang as French arts minister. Alice
Rawsthorn reports on his progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On paper, he has one of the best jobs around. There is the office, one of
the prettiest in Paris, set in the 18th century splendour of the Palais
Royal. There is the avalanche of A-list invitations. And then there is the
arts budget, one of the largest in Europe, with lots of charming Gallic
artists to help to spend it.
Yet when Jacques Toubon was appointed French arts minister after the
conservatives' victory in last spring's elections, the problems of his new
portfolio almost outweighed its attractions. The French recession was
deepening. Edouard Balladur, the new premier, had told his ministers to trim
their budgets and the arts, under past right-wing governments, had been a
prime target for cuts.
To make matters worse the new minister had a very hard act to follow. Jack
Lang, his predecessor, was one of the most popular and powerful members of
the socialist cabinet who, in nearly a decade at the arts ministry, had
doubled its budget and spent it in spectacular style on the Grands Projets,
his modern architectural monuments. His successor faced the unenviable task
of trying to erase the Lang legacy and stamp his own personality over the
arts scene at a time when expenditure was under attack.
It is now almost exactly a year since Jacques Toubon moved into Jack Lang's
old office. The new minister spent his first few months battling to save his
budget from cuts: only to plunge headlong into the Gatt controversy as
chef-de-combat of the Gallic assault against US 'cultural imperialism'. He
is now dodging the jokes over his lobby to protect the French language from
the encroaching anglicisms of franglais that has earned him a new nickname
from France's satirists - Mr Allgood.
'It's certainly been an eventful year,' he says. 'We won the battle for the
budget. It hasn't been cut and I'm very pleased about that. I'd count the
Gatt campaign as another success. As for la loi Toubon, it is too soon to
say. But when I hear them making those jokes about me on the radio at least
I know that people are thinking about the issues.'
The Gatt affray and the franglais affair have been interpreted rather
differently outside France, where they confirmed the worst suspicions of the
French as cultural chauvinists. But such slights have been overshadowed in
France itself by the new minister's success at defending the arts budget,
now frozen at FFr13.45bn for 1994.
Toubon's achievement on the financial front is all the more laudable given
his precarious position in the cabinet. Jack Lang had considerable clout
among the socialists, as deputy prime minister and a confidant of President
Francois Mitterrand. Jacques Toubon risked relegation to a secondary role in
the Balladur administration as an ally of Jacques Chirac, the Paris mayor
and head of the RPR party who is Balladur's arch-rival for the right-wing
candidacy in next year's presidential elections.
Whereas Balladur, who comes from a privileged background, represents the
paternalistic strand of French conservatism, Jacques Toubon is a self-made
man in the Chirac mould. He was born in Nice, the son of a casino croupier
who worked his way up to become a manager. After swotting his way through
the French education system, the young Toubon reached the Ecole Nationale de
l'Administration, the breeding ground for France's political elite.
Despite their differences Toubon has forged a rapport with Balladur. He has
also won over the sceptics in the French arts community who, having dreaded
the arrival of an axe-wielding conservative philistine at the arts ministry,
have been impressed by his enthusiasm for his brief.
His taste may not be quite as eclectic as that of Lang, who prided himself
on his ability to rattle off the titles of the latest rap releases as well
as lines from Rabelais. Toubon's interests run from 'old American movies'
and '1960s and 1970s jazz', to modern drama 'Ionesco, Beckett and Pinter'.
He is also a keen collector of contemporary art, aided and abetted by Lise,
his second wife who has been dubbed 'Hillary' by the ministry's staff for
her assiduous attendance at the A-list parties.
Catholic taste and an affable manner, however, have not been quite enough to
slay the ghost of Lang. Toubon's chief challenge is to define a new
direction for French arts policy in the 1990s after the gauche glamour of
the Grands Projets.
Toubon sees populism as his main aim. 'Thirty years ago only 10 per cent of
the French public participated in the arts,' he says. 'The percentage is
still the same today - despite all the money that's been spent over the past
decade. What's more they're the same sort of people. We've got to change
that.'
One strand of his strategy has been to improve the quality of cultural
activity in the regions: by offering special grants for drama groups with
touring companies and improving resources for music teaching in schools. But
the dominant theme in his new policies - and the leitmotif of the Gatt and
franglais campaigns - is conservation: a concept that fuses neatly with the
avuncular culture of the Balladur regime and marks a stark contrast with the
uncompromising modernism of Lang.
Toubon has already unveiled renovation plans for some of Paris's dilapidated
monuments: the opulent old Garnier opera house and the Pompidou arts centre,
which was built in the early 1970s but is in dire need of repair after two
decades of tourists trudging through it. The next candidates will be the
crumbling churches and chateaux in the provinces followed by the Maisons de
la Culture, the regional arts centres created by Andre Malraux, the French
novelist who was De Gaulle's arts minister in the 1960s.
'We've got to get away from this idea of the arts being the preserve of the
intellectual elite,' he says. 'It might seem more exciting to the
avant-garde to talk about flinging up new buildings, rather than preserving
churches and chateaux. But they're popular, they're accessible and they're
part of our heritage. What's wrong with that?'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Conceptual wit well realised - It all depends on how
you look at Markus Raetz's work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markus Raetz is a Swiss artist, now in his 50s, who has exhibited widely
abroad except in Britain. He is a conceptualist, which is to say that the
informing conceit or idea is what gives his work its imaginative force.
Content before form, as it were: except that without the form, the concept
must hang unresolved in the artist's mind. 'Oh, I see', we always say, as we
take the point.
It is a matter of emphasis, balance, discretion. The conceptual may be in
essence a literary form, with the idea conceived first, and only then
demonstrated or expressed. But, as with all art, even literary art, it is
still the way it is done that counts. And even literary art should change
and grow, and turn in unforeseen directions in the process of the doing.
The great strength of Raetz as an artist lies in the lightness and delicacy
of his conceptual wit, and the complementary lightness of his touch in the
physical resolution and presentation of his ideas. He is unprescriptive,
undidactic, unpolemical, which is in refreshing contrast to the usual
tedious run of right-minded practice within the genre. He spells nothing
out, leaving the work to spring its gentle surprises on us, in our own good
time. We approach his things quizzically, intrigued, and often do not see at
all until we turn to go away.
His central theme is that of metamorphosis, of material and image alike
transformed, to be taken now in this way, now that. 'Ceci' in the mirror
becomes 'Cela'. He draws with twigs, not in the sense of using them as tools
for making marks, but as the drawn line itself, with each set of twigs
combined in the depiction of the particular image.
First we see and read a line upon the wall: then we recognise it in its
physical aspect as a twig, an object in real space, albeit in low relief.
Only then does the image register. As often as not, it is the simple naked
female torso, as it might be Daphne in the grove, and her breasts and thighs
picked out by the gentlest curve and fork of half-a-dozen bits of wood.
In one particular relief-tableau, Raetz takes the principle of fragmented
resolution to a characteristic extreme. Scattered neatly along the wall, so
it seems, is but an arbitrary collection of twigs, and no less arbitrarily
curved and bent and forked. We look up at it puzzled, and at the blue oval
painted alongside, at the plain glass in front of it and the mirror high in
the angle of the wall. Only as we move away to one side do we see, out of
the corner of the eye, that that same torso now shows itself in the mirror,
as its linear elements fly together in the oblique perspective. So, caught
again, back we go in front of it for another look: and as the image falls
apart again, so finally we catch its ghost reflection in the blue oval and
its matching glass.
Not everything is on the wall, nor done by mirrors, and often to walk around
the object is enough. So it is that a still-life sculpture of a large bottle
and small glass suddenly turns itself into, well, a large glass and a small
bottle. A man in a hat turns into a rabbit - or the other way about. Mickey
Mouse comes and goes. A white pipe puffs out blue smoke, turns upside down
and back again, and now puffs white smoke out of blue. It all depends on how
you look at it.
The charm of such work, and the natural interest and entertainment it
affords, is undeniable. Its profundity as art is more questionable. For
beyond the conceptual wit and its delicate ingenuity of expression, what
more does it offer than the hoary old truism - things are not always what
they seem? In the very easiness of its attraction lies its limitation, which
holds true of all conceptualism since old Duchamp stuck his urinal on the
wall and called it Art. Raetz asks us to look at his tricks, at his sleight
of eye and mind, at his delicatesse, which is all very well and honestly
done, but at last, where there is even only tacit explanation, there is no
ambiguity. The difference is between the mere conjuror and the magician
Raetz still might be - were he only to stand away a little from the
mechanics, however lightly stated, and give them room to work their own
magic. 'Ah', we say as, amused, we turn away, 'now I see how he does it.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Portia put into a new perspective - 'The Merchant of
Venice' and 'King Lear'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I had thought that the definitive staging of Act V of The Merchant of Venice
 -the tricky garden scene in which lovers' problems are resolved and no one
even mentions Shylock - was achieved by Peter Hall in his 1989 staging.
But I watched Act V of the current West Yorkshire Playhouse Merchant with
even more emotion and astonishment. Jude Kelly's staging keeps taking you by
surprise, pushing hard against preconceptions, sending you back to
re-examine the text. In this Act V, Shylock is by no means forgotten. This
garden scene - the play is set circa 1920 - starts to come close to the
garden of the Finzi-Continis, a temporary idyll which will soon be invaded.
For Portia, remember, has married a man who, like his friends, is blatantly
anti-Semitic. She has learnt to practise the quality of mercy of which she
spoke, as has Lorenzo. It is, however, by no means certain that their new
enlightenment will prevail over Bassanio, Antonio, Salerio and Solanio. But
racial prejudice is only one theme in this play, which has undercurrents
this staging hoists into the light. Above all, it retells the tale of
Portia.
Portia, in a brilliantly intelligent and complex performance, is Nichola
McAuliffe. Her first words are 'By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is
aweary of this great world,' and for once she really means it. So worldweary
is she, so tired and angry at the fetters placed upon her by the conditions
of her father's will, that she is swigging wine and firing an unloaded gun
into her own mouth when first we see her. This is Portia as Dorothy Parker.
She can still be Portia the great lady and Portia the dangerous wit - even
Portia the huntress - but she achieves that poise only on the brink of
despair. And she learns that her father is not the only man whose wishes
will confront hers.
She is far more smitten with Bassanio than he with her. But love makes makes
her quick to realise how bound up he is with Antonio. Antonio, Bassanio et
al inhabit a closety, men-only milieu in Venice; and the fact that she is
dressing up as a man acquires immense irony. In the trial scene she hears
Bassanio tell Antonio 'Life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with
me esteem'd above thy life'. And, even after trumping Shylock with her
superior command of the law, she still urges him 'Prepare thee to cut off
the flesh', not without a spasm of malice against Antonio. To Shylock she is
not vindictive, merely precise; and the more she observes him, the more
reluctant she is to use the law against him.
The nastiest shock occurs at the end of this same scene. Antonio and her
husband, treating her as 'one of us', rush upon her with instant talk of
love - as if to initiate her into their gay mafia. And so, when Bassanio
finally gives up the ring he had from his wife as a present to this
wonderboy lawyer, she is aghast - and teeters right back into full despair.
Sure enough, when Antonio meets her (not suspecting her recent drag act) on
her home ground in Belmont as his friend's wife, he is now chilly and
perfunctory. And, when she confronts Bassanio, she does so with real rage
and heartbreak at his perfidy ('Even so void is your false heart of truth').
Though I have known this play for over 25 years, I followed all of this, and
much else in this production, as if I never knew what would happen next.
Several of the Venetian scenes occur in, or just outside, the Jewish ghetto.
Not only Venice's Jews but also its black slaves (to whom Shylock refers at
some length in the court scene) attend on several scenes. Shylock (Gary
Wildhorn) is eloquent, as both oppressed and oppressor.
Bassanio (Richard Lintern) is sexually ambivalent - he exercises his charm
on both Antonio and Portia in quite disturbingly similar ways - and Antonio
(Michael Cashman, a daringly unsympathetic reading) is a buttoned-up
misogynist smoothie who snivels in terror of Shylock's knife. But the
excellence of this staging lies not in individuals but in ensemble. No one
delivers a single speech as if it were (mere) poetry; everything has its
point. And no one addresses their lines out into the audience; everything is
focused within the stage world.
Another company tackling Shakespeare for the second time has received rather
more national attention, mainly because it is all-black. This is the Talawa
Theatre Company, directed by Yvonne Brewster; but in its new King Lear it
comes off considerably worse than in its 1991 Antony and Cleopatra. Lear and
poor Tom do a little rap routine; a white plastic sheet lowers itself in
stages on the proceedings; the play begins with, and returns to, amplified
heavy breathing. Edmund, Edgar, and Gloucester seem to come from three
utterly different backgrounds; and relaxed verse-speaking, despite some
individually excellent feats of phrasing, is still a general problem.
The 39-year-old Ben Thomas (replacing Norman Beaton) is a most likeable
actor, and so accomplished that he is the first Lear I have heard to bring
off 'Never never never never never' as iambic rather than trochaic (Edmund
Wilson and Vladimir Nabokov corresponded with some intensity on this
matter). He is too energetic and too sane to be King Lear, but he has great
dignity, and is often revealing. He can fuse poetry and meaning wonderfully;
the imagery of 'birds i' the cage' and 'gilded butterflies', playing off
each other in the same speech, acquired unusual beauty and poignancy. I hope
he returns to the role, in a production more worthy of his mettles; and I
hope he plays other, younger, Shakespearian roles soon.
The Merchant of Venice is in repertory at the West Yorkshire Playhouse,
Leeds, until April 23; King Lear is at the Cochrane Theatre, WC1, until
April 16.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: New lease of life for Waddesdon - Lord Rothschild
invites the public to a permanent party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waddesdon Manor, a bizarre fantasy of French chateau architecture in the
midst of the Buckinghamshire countryside, was the stately pleasure dome of
Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild. Commissioned in 1874 from the architect
Hippolyte Destailleurs, it took 15 years to complete.
The situation, atop a pointed hill, was unpromising but the peak was sliced
off and a huge artificial platform was erected to accommodate the house. A
temporary railway was installed to bring the building materials from the
nearest station at Quainton, four miles away, and was carried across
viaducts in the garden known as 'Tay Bridge'. An entire 'model' farm and
dairy was also created. When the estate was completed, it appeared as if it
had been there for centuries. The instant effect of permanence was achieved
by the wholesale importation of thousands of already-mature trees and the
bedding-out of plants in tens of thousands.
After a century, Waddesdon was in need of a face-lift, but what started out
as a standard restoration by the National Trust, which owns the house and
gardens, swiftly turned into the greatest revitalisation of a country-house
estate in modern times. Six years ago, when he inherited neighbouring
Eythrope and the family interest in Waddesdon, which includes land and
buildings on the estate, Lord Jacob Rothschild decided to direct his
considerable energy and taste - and money - into transforming both house and
grounds. The ground floor and wine cellars can be seen from next Thursday
when they open to the public.
The first floor, which opens next year, is being returned to two grand
rooms, fitted out with 18th-century French panelling found in the Waddesdon
stables and originally bought by Baron Ferdinand in Paris. The panels have
been restored and fitted by French craftsmen brought in from Angers and
Bordeaux, while the whole operation has been under the architectural
direction of Peter Inskip, assisted by Alain Gruber, the expert on French
decorative arts.
Three new rooms have been formed to display the sensational Waddesdon
collection of Sevres porcelain. That collection now includes the remarkable
1766 Starhemberg service which has never been seen in public before. Lord
Rothschild is attempting to complete it by seeking out examples of the
biscuit figures that would originally have formed the centrepiece of the
service.
A separate exhibition space will be devoted to displays about the Rothschild
family, featuring a specially commissioned painting of the family tree by
Jean-Marc Winkler. This work traces the rise of the family from its origins
in the ghetto of Frankfurt to the construction of 60 great houses across
Europe by the five branches of the family in the 19th century. Miriam
Rothschild, adviser to Prince Charles on his wild-flower meadow at
Highgrove, author of the seven-volume definitive catalogue of fleas, and
writer of over 300 scientific papers, calls the family 'the original EC'.
She adds, with characteristic pungency, that all the gigantic Rothschild
houses had one thing in common: 'Not a single member of my family had any
taste whatsoever.'
So much for the famed 'gout Rothschild', which was, after all, a taste that
defied taste. And, let's be frank, Waddesdon is anything but a model of good
taste. It is packed with sensational treasures, furniture, tapestries,
pictures and panelling, purchased promiscuously throughout Europe, with a
special predeliction for anything French, the more elaborately carved and
gilded the better.
But Miriam Rothschild concedes that her nephew, Jacob, is an exception so
far as the family's lack of taste is concerned and under his influence
Waddesdon is assuming a more coherent shape. When the ground floor, which
contains most of the pictures and furniture, opens next week there will be
some surprises. For the first time visitors will see one of the largest
masterpieces of French 18th-century furniture, an 'armoire' by Bernard van
Risamburgh, perhaps the most inspired of all cabinet-makers.
Waddesdon was always something of a display-case on a huge scale, but the
house is now being brought back to life. The decision has been made to
provide an impression of readiness for a house party in Baron Ferdinand's
time, by reference to photographs in Baron Ferdinand's 'Red Book' for 1897.
Mercifully, for those who distrust the 'faction' approach to the
presentation of historic interiors, the additions necessary to achieve this
effect were few: the laying of a dining table; the recreation of some floral
centrepieces.
Lord Rothschild has put the vast wine cellars back to use, adding facilities
for tastings and entertainment, and featuring the Rothschild family's great
wines. In a similar initiative, Baron Ferdinand's original dairy at the foot
of the hill has been transformed under Julian Bannerman into estate offices,
a conference and entertainment centre, the exteriors scrupulously restored.
Waddesdon's perilous similarity to seaside hotel architecture had not been
helped by a diminished garden next to the house which had an uncomfortable
air of a clock-golf circuit. With a scholarship from the Royal Botanical
Gardens at Kew, Lord Rothschild's daughter Beth has supervised the
recreation of the extraordinary 'ribbon planting' that produced massive
raised flower-beds. These will be in keeping with the overweening facade
which survives as the outstanding monument to the Rothschild mania for
building and collecting: a crazily romantic fiction of a French chateau of a
type that never was.

dedicated to Waddesdon Manor.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Middle-class mockery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They're back. After five years of sulking in their sequins Dillie Keane has
reformed Fascinating Aida, and sophisticated cabaret returns to our lives.
The gap has been filled, almost manfully, by Kit and the Widow, and, with
the boys also currently in town, London is remarkably soignee at the moment.
Sweet FA are reassuringly the same, with songs about the plight of the
single girl constantly searching for the elusive network of single men, and
on the waywardness of the modern world. And yet they are reassuringly
different. The maverick Keane, with her face like a crumpled wedding cake,
and long time partner Adele Anderson, with the voice that reaches down
almost to the testosterone level, have been joined by Issy van Randwyck, the
Dutch treat.
It is a brave addition, for Issy is a skilled cabaret artist, with the voice
of a brazen angel and an impish smile. There is an awful lot of temperament
on stage now but on first sighting this is going to be the best sung, and
probably the most adventurous, FA yet.
Dillie Keane has written around a dozen new songs which stay safely within
the FA tradition. When three such independent women tear to pieces
vociferous minorities in 'Politically Correct' you know the movement is
doomed; 'Kiss and Tell' is equally scathing about cheque book adultery. But
more welcome in the first half was a trio of serious songs, notably a
tingling 'Haunted' by Issy, which could become the popular hit that has
always eluded Keane.
After the interval Fascinating Aida attempt slapstick, with the Trio
Berserka from the East European state of Legovia. It is broad, funny, and
almost poignant as the women, with Dillie a drunken granny, sell their
culture for the Yankee dollar.
It takes some time to get back into the mainstream, but after Keane has got
her personal life sorted out (sort of) with 'Back with You' and her
political dreams dusted down with 'Socialist Britain', FA can perform their
anthem for the forlorn female, 'Sew on a Sequin', with the necessary brio.
Throw in the encores, the (dodgy) costume changes, a set that would have
charmed Liberace, the backchat, and the essential shade of desperation
behind the bold fronts, and you have Fascinating Aida vigorously back on
top. This is middle-class mockery at its most arch but if you like this sort
of thing you will love it.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Not Weill done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the long list of Kurt Weill works demanding revival, the anti-war satire
Johnny Johnson stands near the top. As his first completely American
music-theatre piece it occupies a special place in his output; for its
heartfelt conviction it deserves a sympathetic staging. Alas, Thursday's
eagerly-anticipated production by Trinity College of Music's company A
Moveable Feast fell far short of the mark.
The naive directness of Johnny Johnson, premiered on Broadway in 1936, makes
it a child of its time. Weill had settled in New York the year before as a
refugee from Nazi Germany, and yet he found it in him to espouse the
pacifist message - the soldier Johnny tries to halt the first world war by
dosing its generals with laughing gas - of his librettist Paul Green.
This performance at the Rudolf Steiner Theatre was billed as the 'British
premiere', perhaps because previous airings in London have been less than
complete. There were cuts here too, though they were not to blame for the
evening's lack of impact. Nothing of the score's pungency came across under
the American conductor Rhonda Kess. She seemed content to beat time
listlessly, and the 12-piece band responded with caution: all the numbers
had a sameness about them.
Kess was also credited with the stage direction, though there was little to
be seen. Her production relied on slapstick humour and hammy accents rather
than mad-comic intensity. Pamela Glynn's minimal designs included flags, and
maps of Flanders and France in the shape of headstones. At least Dawn
Kellogg's costumes were effective.
The student performers deserved better guidance than they got. Johnny (Sean
Sweeney) was miscast - he may have little to sing, but the poignant
'Johnny's Song' needs a strong voice. Lianne-Marie Skriniar was touching as
Johnny's sweetheart Minnie-Belle, and David Watters turned in an effective
cameo as the Cowboy in the trenches.
Johnny Johnson still awaits a serious revival. Oddly, this production was
funded by the Weill Foundation.

FT  26 MAR 94 / 'Traditions' that mean nothing: As They Say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A writer in the Spectator magazine the other day told of what happened when
he entertained Enoch Powell, the former Conservative cabinet minister, at a
meeting of a local Tory party association. (Readers outside Britain should
know that Powell used to be a Tory but fell out with them and went on to
represent the Ulster Unionists in parliament. He is renowned for his
penetrating intellect.)
To quote the article: 'Each time Mr Powell made a remark critical of the
government, he was applauded incontinently. When a man stood up to announce
he would be standing as an anti-federalist, against a Tory candidate, in
June's Euro-elections, the ovation from his fellow Conservatives verged on
the hysterical. There are pockets of Toryism flourishing and vibrant in
Britain today. Sadly for Mr Major (the Prime Minister), they are unrelated
to the government.'
The writer added: 'Given the attitude of those who run the party now, I had
better not say which Conservative association played host.' This is
understandable: faced with the prospect of a confrontation with that Himmler
of the Tory party, chairman Sir Norman Fowler, the most vibrant right-wing
blood runs cold.
Fortunately, I have uncovered details of the meeting. It was held just
outside Ewell, Surrey, in the function room of Ye Olde Cocke House Inne,
which stands between the Wok-on-By Chinese restaurant and a kitchenware shop
called Hote Cuisine. There was a delicious meal (breaded scampi on a bed of
lettuce 'garnished with all the trimming's').
The debate on the European Union was followed by a heated discussion led by
Powell on another subject dear to his heart: the menace of coloured
immigration. It included his famous expose of how Shakespeare's works had
been written by a group of Elizabethan courtiers.
I have spent much time burrowing through Europe's newspapers to see if
lesser nations can produce anything to match this very English occasion. But
their acceptance of the integration of Europe, and the suffocation of their
own traditions, remains remarkable, partly because they do not believe that
is what is occurring.
Instead, they share a belief in a need for an authority to make rules to
create that 'level playing field' so beloved of British politicians and
which can make a single market work. That those employed in that authority
are sometimes incompetent, corrupt, arrogant and stupid in no way
distinguishes them from officials in the various national capitals.
There is also a belief that the process of enlargement makes the system
harder to operate, and a conclusion that the present British attempt to
lower the proportion of votes needed for a veto is meant to ensure no
decisions are taken at all. But, even then, there is not that moral outrage
which characterises the British debate.
There is certainly no equivalent of the Eurosceptic fury over the
destruction wrought on a thousand years of constitutional perfection.
Perhaps it is because these nations enjoy no such tradition. No chaps in
tights opening their parliaments. No national leaders giving clear answers
during the remorseless probing of prime minister's question time. There is
no hysterical concern with the sexual incontinence of gentlemen in leading
positions, either.
Britain, the land that was once known for its phlegm and sang-froid is now
in the grip of inexplicable obsessions. And those UK newspapers which make
most of the trifling peccadillos of public figures are also those in which
Europhobia is most pronounced.
I must thank Fernando Vallespin, a writer in El Pais of Madrid, for
explaining why. He was struck by the difference in attitudes towards sexual
misdeeds in Britain and the US, on the one hand, and Brazil and Austria, on
the other. (The president of the former behaved in an unseemly manner during
the carnival in Rio; the activities of Austria's president were documented
here last month.)
There is, says Vallespin, 'a connection which almost always exists between
repressive societies and liberal states'. Economic liberalism, he argues, is
connected with capitalism in such a way that it pre-supposes the promotion
of self-interest.
As a result, a liberal state has to impose artificial rules to replace the
glue that exists in traditional systems. There rules are broken easily
without society falling to bits. Britain is no more a traditional society
than Ye Olde Cocke House is a traditional inn. Its rules bind private and
public morality in a seamless, brittle whole.
So it is, I deduce, that European integration generates moral explosions in
Britain: European integration is penetration by Europe. As Vallespin noted:
'One must not forget that Adam Smith was as much a moral philosopher as an
economist.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Motoring: When only shire horses will do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An on/off-road, four-wheel drive turned into an executive express sounds
improbable. But no more so, I suppose, than the transformation of a
redundant barn, oast house or stable block into a desirable residence - and
south-east England is now dotted with them.
If you fancy using such a vehicle as a business car, go for a Range Rover
converted by a small company called Overfinch. One I used for a wintry week
recently was by far the best Range Rover I have driven.
The Overfinch version had been given an engine transplant. Out went the
4.2-litre Rover V8; in went a General Motors' 5.7-litre V8. These days it is
politically (for which read environmentally) incorrect to say so - but, if
you are after truly relaxed high performance, there is no substitute for
litres.
The GM V8 delivers 284 horsepower and 344lb/ft of torque, a measure of
pulling power at a given engine speed. For sheer brawn, it makes the
largest-engined standard Range Rover, the 4,278cc LSE (200hp and 250lb/ft of
torque), feel almost a weakling.
At 80mph (128kph) and 3,000rpm, the cabin was quiet enough for enjoyable
Classic FM listening. On non-motorway journeys, overtaking was instant and,
therefore, safe.
A prod with the right toe slipped the automatic transmission into third.
With a bull-like bellow, the two-ton machine hurtled forward, all-wheel
drive keeping the Avon Turbospeed tyres gripping on wet surfaces.
Handling and ride comfort stood comparison with that of a normal executive
saloon. But, realistically, no tweaks (however clever) can make two heavy
beam axles behave like fully independent suspension.
So, although it did not wallow on corners, the Overfinch Range Rover's lofty
body leaned a bit if a roundabout was taken quickly. Potholes did not pass
unnoticed, either. As I sat straight-backed on fragrant Connolly hide,
enjoying a horseman's view of the countryside, I felt as though I were
driving a very short wheelbase Bentley Turbo R or a high-off-the-ground
Aston Martin V8.
High speed, road-pattern tyres, and reduced ground clearance and axle
articulation make an Overfinch Range Rover unsuitable for rough and muddy
terrain - where few of its kind venture, anyway. It would, though, do nicely
for getting out of slithery car parks at race meetings.
A full conversion - engine transplant, modified running gear and steering,
Recaro sports seats and some nicely understated cosmetic changes - costs a
little over Pounds 18,000. A brand-new Overfinch Range Rover Vogue SE will
leave little change out of Pounds 55,000, which is barely more than half the
price of the cheapest Bentley and less than a third of an Aston Martin
Virage shooting brake.
Overfinch, however, will do the same work on the cheaper Land Rover
Discovery, mechanically the Range Rover's twin brother. Nor need you start
with a new host vehicle. One up to six years old can be tackled if in
generally good fettle.
I have said often that I could not see much point in using a beefy
on/off-road 4x4 exclusively on tarmac, and the logic still escapes me. But
the choice of road-going, four-wheel driven automatic estate cars with
really high performance is tiny.
There is an Audi 100 2.8E quattro and BMW 525i X Touring at list prices of
Pounds 28,655 and Pounds 31,330 respectively, or a less prestigious but
worthy Subaru Legacy 2.2 GX 4WD at a mere Pounds 18,399. But when nothing
less than four-wheel drive, two pedals, shire horse muscle and a high
seating position will do, it has to be the Overfinch.
If you can countenance a fuel consumption of 15-17mpg (18.8-16.6 l/100km) of
super unleaded, call Overfinch on 0420-542 877. Not a word, please, to
Friends of the Earth, but I promise you will find a 120mph (193kmh), 0-60mph
(0-96kmh) in well under eight seconds Overfinch Range Rover one of today's
really great drives.
A possible large-engined alternative, with smooth automatic transmission and
unimpaired off-roadability, is the Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its
5.2-litre V8 produces 212hp and 285 lbs/ft torque (more than a standard
4.2-litre Range Rover, less than the Overfinch with the GM engine).
Now on sale in Britain at Pounds 27,995, it is a bargain. The price includes
air-conditioning, anti-lock brakes, leather seats and power operation for
almost everything. The snag is that, at present, it comes only in left-hand
drive.
Another possibility is Mitsubishi's latest Shogun 3.5-litre V6 (Pounds
35,889), which is in the same prestige, performance and price class as an
off-the-peg Range Rover Vogue SE (Pounds 36,130).

FT  26 MAR 94 / That's no way to treat a Lady - or is it?: Alerted by the
rattle of teacups in the home counties, Rachel Johnson hears about changes
to a very English institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a story to which only Barbara Pym, or perhaps Joanna Trollope, could
do full justice. No Aga saga, it concerns The Lady, that gentlewoman of the
racy world of female magazines, and the fluster that is attending her
belated arrival into the 20th century.
While other women's magazines compete ever more vigorously to reveal the
secrets of sexual attractiveness or style and acoutrements of the modern
woman, The Lady's imagined reader sits, needlepoint forgotten on her lap,
dog at her feet, curtains drawn tightly against the mild home counties
night. Gripped by the latest instalment of The Rector's Wife, she barely
feels tired after a hectic day. Church flower rota, Help the Aged lunch and
the health club have all lent a glow to cheeks already weatherbeaten by
daily gardening.
At first glance, The Lady has barely changed direction since the 19th
century.
'The Lady will be essentially English, and the subjects will be treated from
an English point of view,' the first issue declared in 1885. Its aim, 'to
provide information without dulness (sic), and entertainment without
vulgarity; and to be at once useful and necessary without ceasing to be
bright and lively.'
But appearances can be deceptive. Although the magazine is English and
genteel as ever - its mix of household tips, recipes, fashion, gardening and
acres of classified nanny-to-cottage advertisements remain intact - changes
are afoot.
The first edition of The Lady was launched in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles,
the proprietor and editor of Vanity Fair. His elder daughter, Sydney, became
Lady Redesdale and mother of the Mitford sisters, and her governess became
editor for 30 years.
The magazine remains in the hands of the Bowles family, and there have been
only eight editors in its history. Since 1891, when Bowles sold its unlikely
stablemate Vanity Fair, The Lady has occupied the same corner offices at 39
and 40 Bedford Street, London. Decked out in a livery of mahogany panelling
and eau-de-nil paint trim, the building sticks out like a Merchant Ivory
film set among the diners and hamburger joints of Covent Garden.
But when the wind is blowing a certain way, the 20th century intrudes and
The Lady's fragrant flower-filled offices reek of fat from the kitchens of
neighbouring FatBoy's Diner.
The wind is blowing that way today. Three years ago a new editor arrived,
Arline Usden, from the racy world of Woman magazine, where she was beauty
editor, and Successful Slimming, where she was editor. Joan Grahame, the
seventh editor, was due for retirement after being in the job since 1971 but
died during the crossover fortnight that followed Usden's appointment.
'It didn't have a layout. It didn't have an art department. It didn't have
an editorial structure. It had girls, not necessarily trained, throwing
things on pages,' said Usden, throwing a nervous glance towards her open
office door.
Her bosses are Ron Bulloch, the white-haired general manager of 20 years -
an average stint on The Lady, where the head of the classified ads has been
in the same job for 30 years - and his assistant, David Richards.
In a cautious interview, at which a secretary takes notes, Bulloch makes one
thing clear: the changes Usden has introduced will be quite sufficient for
the time being.
She appointed an arts editor, staff writers, a home economist, introduced
spots of colour in food and fashion spreads, and changed the covers.
Although The Lady is still the only magazine on the rack to feature a vase
of daffodils on its front, the covers are brighter and better photographed
than they used to be.
She made the pagination more suitable for a weekly than an annual. The
magazine used to start in Roman numerals, for the classified ads, until the
contents page, when it would lurch to page 353 (if it was August). Current
editions start at page one and proceed from there until the inside cover at
around page 80: always the reader special offer - from Wellington boots to a
three-tier steamer.
Her innovations include more features and a 'Favourite Things' column at the
back, for celebrities with granny-appeal, such as Nigel Havers, to reveal
their fondness for roast chicken and gardening.
All very innocuous, one might think. But Usden wants to go further. The
magazine opens, and always has, with more than 20 pages of small
advertisements. Usden wants to banish the classified adverts to the back,
institute a proper contents on page 3, and introduce full colour. But the
old guard wants the advertisements to remain to the fore and wants to keep
The Lady's editorial content as traditional as possible, and ensure that
Polson's cornflour, Sunlight Soap and Cash's nametapes advertise in 1995 as
they did in 1885.
'We are very schizophrenic. Our readers divide into those who buy it for the
ads and who don't read the magazine and those who buy it for the magazine
but don't read the ads,' says Usden
For it is undoubtedly to The Lady that those seeking nannies, housekeepers,
companions - and even housemen and butlers - turn. According to a Reading
University survey, more than a third of high-earning families in some areas
employed either a cleaner or a nanny.
Usden does not undervalue the advertisements; but she wants to make The Lady
competitive with other magazines in appearance and content. 'We are the only
magazine without full colour,' she sighs.
So it will be The Lady readers who decide. The doughty gentlewomen of the
home counties, who subscribe and write Letters, the magazine's most famous
feature.
Amanda Dukes has been editing these gems - around 100 of them a week - for
several years. A typical spread will kick off with a letter asking for a
recipe for lamb stew (to which a Meat Marketing Board recipe will be
offered); and continue with household tips (how to remove candlewax from
velvet curtains) and 'where can I gets'.
'Where can I get directoire knickers - an item of long acetate underwear -
is reasonably common,' says Amanda Dukes. Every letter is answered, the
gardening ones by Classic FM's Clay Jones.
And these readers, one darkly suspects, are the type that value continuity,
however dull, above stylishness. As one wrote to Arline Usden in February,
'your magazine is clean and wholesome . . . an oasis of good taste in an
ocean of tat. Thank you.'
Jan Waddell, the special offers editor, thinks The Lady's old-fashioned
formula serves its readership exactly what they want.
'We don't have a female bias like most other magazines. We have gardening,
travel, wine, finance. We don't do things on sex and women's insides. Our
readers aren't interested in how many orgasms you've had this week.'
For readers who prefer Middlemarch to the Camomile Lawn, the genteely
impoverished do-gooders, there can be no contest. The Lady has changed
enough, and even Arline Usden knows it. She will move gently, if at all,
from here, so that The Lady will give its readers no cause to tut-tut
fiercely over their Rich Tea and morning coffee.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At Pounds 19,350, the Ford Probe 24v, 2.5-litre V6 raises the sports coupe
stakes. This elegant, Mazda-inspired and US-made three-door went on sale
this week at prices undercutting those of most rivals. A 16v, two-litre
version is cheaper still at Pounds 15,995.
The Probe, Ford's first sports coupe since the Capri, has gone too far
up-market to be called a Capri replacement. The 24v I drove last week was a
swift although silky performer: quiet on the motorway, flexible in traffic,
eagerly responsive when required. Young (or just young in heart) business
motorists used to driving mainly on their own would find one a nice change
after several Granadas or Scorpios.

FT  26 MAR 94 / This is Germany calling . . .: How former rival radio
stations are struggling to work together in unified Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once they were the big guns in the front line of the cold war, hurling
salvoes of propaganda into the airwaves across the east-west divide.
Now, 4 1/2 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, broadcasters from the
two big radio stations, which fought for the hearts and minds of Germans
across the divided city, are supposed to be on the same side.
But the old antagonism dies hard, and their recent struggles show some of
the difficulties of integrating the former East and West Germanys.
During the cold war, Berlin was at the centre of the battle of the airwaves
between the two great powers. The US established Radio Free Europe and Radio
Liberty, with headquarters in in Munich, Bavaria, to beam news, current
affairs and music across the Iron Curtain. The Soviet Union retaliated with
dozens of propaganda language services.
After years of heated debate about the future of these relics of the cold
war, a national radio station has been created in Cologne, the first in
Germany since the second world war. It began broadcasting on new year's day.
But even if the new Deutschland Radio, is national, it certainly has not
achieved unity among the broadcasting staff of formerly warring stations.
Deutschland Radio was intended to combine three radio stations with
extremely different histories: Rias (Radio in the American Sector), based in
west Berlin; DS Kultur, set up in east Berlin after the dismantling of the
Wall; and Deutschlandfunk, set up by the Bonn government in Cologne during
the years of a divided Germany.
In cold-war Berlin there were two radio stations: Rias in the west, and
Stimme der DDR, Voice of the German Democratic Republic. They broadcasted
every minute of the day from opposite sides of the Wall.
Stimme der DDR tried to monopolise the airwaves throughout eastern Germany,
while across Berlin the US-backed Rias station kept alive the hopes of
reunification with powerful transmitters, among west and east Berliners.
But the night in November 1989, when at last the Wall came down, was not
just a glorious victory for the ideology of Rias, it also removed the main
reason for the station's existence.
Siegfried Buschschluter, director of programmes at Rias since 1988, said his
station was deluged with letters from listeners in eastern Germany, able at
last to communicate without fear of interception by the Stasi, the East
German A few miles away the same event brought a bewildering sense of
disorientation for staff in the East German station. Stimme der DDR was
losing its voice.
'The events were overwhelming. What could we do?' said Monika Kunzl, who for
five years had worked at Stimme's radio drama department. She said that
between November and mid-1990, Stimme's headquarters underwent its own
revolution: the long, wide corridors echoed to the sound of people rushing
'to create a new, democratic radio station for the people of eastern
Germany'.
Scores of producers, technicians and staff left, aware that their Stasi past
would catch up with them. Those who remained broke up the old broadcasting
structure and set up four new stations. Only one survived: Deutschlandsender
Kultur, or DS Kultur.
'It was a time of traumatic change, but also a time of genuine democracy for
us when we formally set up DS Kultur in June 1990,' explained Kunzl, who was
elected by the staff as the station's first director.
'We had to adapt to so much. Finding money. Coping with a new system.
Getting the right to broadcast. Understanding new laws, and above all,
addressing the impact of unification on our lives. We wanted DS Kultur to be
the new voice for the eastern Germans, to reflect this sense of incredible
change.'
The station, with its staff of 169, organised the network in such a way that
its audience of 60,000 - mostly east Berliners - would have classical music
24 hours a day interspersed with documentaries and discussions focusing on
the problems thrown up by unification.
But its days were numbered. Buschschluter said: 'There was little chance
that DS Kultur would survive as a separate station because of the
Staatsvertrag, or state treaty, which said the former east German radio
stations and televisions would have to be dissolved.
'However, the prime ministers from all 16 states decided to set up a new
radio station which would replace Rias and DS Kultur. After all, both
stations had lost their raison d'etre,' he said.
Deutschlandfunk and Rias, on the other hand, had much in common. They shared
the same aim of keeping alive the possibility of unification of the
Germanys; both stations were financed by the state - with Rias receiving
some support from the US; but each had a different audience. Rias homed in
on Berlin and other parts of eastern Germany; Deutschlandfunk captured parts
of western and southern eastern Germany.
And so, on new year's day, Deutschland Radio, an amalgam of Rias, DS Kultur
and Deutschlandfunk, began broadcasting with a DM300m (Pounds 117m) annual
budget financed through a public licence fee of 75 pfennigs (35p) a month.
But already programme makers in Cologne's Deutschlandfunk are unhappy. They
say they can work with Rias, but not with the DS Kultur programme, which
they accuse of elitism. The Cologne station has also refused to use
Deutschland Radio as its new signature title and has declined to take staff
from Berlin to ease the integration of westerners and easterners and to
promote a genuine national broadcasting service.
Dettmar Cramer, programme director of Deutschlandfunk, says the Berliners do
not want to move: 'It's that typical attitude of the Berliners, complaining
that Cologne is too far. Only three of the DS Kultur people have joined us.'
Buschschluter hits back by saying: 'Cologne has not opened it doors to Rias
or to the people from DS Kultur. Cologne has made no compromises. They act
as if nothing has changed since unification.
'It reflects the attitude from Bonn/Cologne about moving the government to
Berlin. These people do not want any change. It wants to preserve the status
quo ante-1989.'
The listeners are disorientated too: in the mornings, they hear Rias's old
programme - news and current affairs, along with easy-listening music - and
in the early afternoon, DS Kultur, a classical station, takes over.
Despite the bickering, which barely conceals the tensions of unification,
Buschschluter and Kunzl recognise that the real issue is listeners. 'We have
to integrate the two Berlin stations and hold on to our listeners,' said
Buschschluter. 'We have to make this new station work on a truly national
basis,' he added.
'Here is a chance to make something new, and truly united with easterners
and westerners pulling together to make this national network succeed,' said
Kunzl.
'It means we will all have to integrate, even though the easterners might
feel they have lost their voice in the process.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Despatches: Tokyo village is fun city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILL DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from being the size of a small house, it looked like a white-mantled
sumo wrestler, round haunches hunkered down on the pavement. It was a
gigantic snowman with neon lights flashing around its head as children
tumbled over its ample lap. A fine mist slid from the shoulders, for the air
was not only humid but unbearably hot.
For this was no Alpine mid-winter festival but a late summer street party in
central Tokyo to celebrate o-bon, when the Japanese are supposed to worship
their ancestors - and have a good knees-up at the same time. The snowman had
spent the past few months preserved, doubtless at huge cost, in an
underground freezer in the mountains.
That morning, it had made the journey to Tokyo in the back of a van to
advertise the ski resort where it had been made the previous winter.
A few hours later, it had melted, the only trace a muddy puddle reflecting
glimmers of neon.
What does this tell you about Tokyo? It told me, a new arrival after four
years in Paris, that certain French politicians have got it all wrong about
the Japanese - or, at least, about the Tokyo-ites.
On first meeting, the people of Tokyo do not resemble an army of worker
ants, as one former French prime minister maintained. On the contrary, this
is a capital that knows how to have fun, even in the middle of recession.
A look at Tokyo's ever-changing skyline, only slightly more enduring than
summer snowmen, proves that this city has a finely developed sense of the
eccentric.
Here, for example, are some landmarks on the drive from my flat into central
Tokyo: a mock Tuscan palace (which does double duty as a wine bar and coffee
centre; a two storey advertisement hoarding of a silhouetted face with
electric flashing eyes; and a galleon stranded on top of an office block. If
I continue to the flesh-coloured, condom-shaped building that advertises a
brand of rubber, then I have gone too far. Quite a change from the Champs
Elysees.
This is no ant heap; far from it. In fact, Tokyo is not even a city. It is
more like an agglomeration of thousands of small villages, bound together
loosely by expressways. In between these, there is a hopeless maze of tiny,
one-way lanes. It makes for pleasant residential living - so long as you can
find the way to your flat.
Some critics claim that the road system is a hidden trade barrier to keep
foreigners at bay. The problem with that theory is that many of the road
signs are in English (not much help), and even Tokyo taxi drivers find it
seriously difficult to get around.
My own guess is that the road system is an industrial policy in favour of
telecommunication companies. Visitors are routinely sent faxes showing the
route. Rich Tokyo-ites take a mobile telephone in the car, head in the
general direction of their meeting and ring for directions once in the area.
The telecom companies must make a fortune.
Whatever the explanation, why change? Tokyo-ites appear to like their
village life - and with reason, because Tokyo's village qualities make it
what must be one of the least threatening cities in the world. The local
newspapers carry little few stories about traditional big city problems such
as Aids, drugs and violent crime.
I am told this is because they hardly exist in Tokyo, despite the fraud and
corruption surrounding national politics. In fact, some people are worried
that the new government's clampdown on corruption could break up the cosy
friendship between the yakuza gangster clans and the police, so tempting the
yakuza to turn to drug peddling.
For now, though, the yakuza stay off the front pages. Instead, an endearing
debate on waste disposal has been a big running story lately.
It began with a fumbled attempt by the city council to force people to put
out rubbish in personally-named transparent plastic bags. The aim was to
ensure that residents bagged burnable and non-burnable rubbish separately, a
laudable but little-obeyed rule.
This provoked an outcry on two fronts. Residents did not want to be
identified individually with their empty take-away tempura boxes, while
bag-makers complained that they could not switch production from black to
transparent sacks in time.
The city council climbed down and gave residents three months before they
had to buy new sacks, showing that consensus, that vital ingredient of
village life, is still alive in modern Tokyo.
Of course, Tokyo has a fair sprinkling of its own brand of urban vices. An
example is a distressing recent development in the Japanese fondness for
vending machines (from which most necessities and some non-necessities,
ranging from compact discs to fresh flowers, can be obtained). Used female
underwear, sold at Y3,000 (Pounds 19) apiece, is the latest marketing trick
devised by a vending machine owner in Shibuya, apparently with great initial
success.
That is, until the local authority clamped down after complaints from
residents. Nothing in Japanese laws on public morality outlaws such trade.
But that did not deter the local council. It turned, successfully, to a law
which outlaws the sale of used goods without a permit.
The vending machine scandal tells you another useful truth about Tokyo and,
perhaps, Japan. The often criticised Japanese way of tackling problems from
oblique angles can be effective. It could even be an ingredient in Japan's
success.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Skiing: Head for the hills in a helicopter - Affordable
flights offer fresh views of the dramatic Dolomites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High in the mighty Dolomites, Danilo aimed the helicopter at a yawning
cavity in the rockface of Sassolungo, the 10,433ft peak which towers above
Val Gardena. Below us was a narrow, fearsome-looking snow-filled gulley,
known to locals as the Jaws of Death.
At any moment I expected Danilo to climb steeply but instead he kept going,
squeezing the helicopter through the gap. Before we had caught our breath we
were swooping low over another snow-filled eyrie - and another couloir where
only intrepid skiers dare to tread.
We continued to weave our way through the impossibly sheer giant walls and
pinnacles of the rest of the Gruppo Sella range, swooping up the steep gully
we were ourselves about to ski: the Val di Mesdi.
The unusual shape of the Dolomites - gigantic, often vertical slabs of
granite - produces a dramatic contrast in the ski terrain. The off-piste
chutes and gullies are challenging, some seriously so.
They are also pretty inaccessible. If, like the majority of skiers you ski
round the Dolomites, rather than down them, the pistes are, by and large,
fairly gentle. In good weather, the Sella Ronda tour, a day-long circuit
from resort to resort of 20 miles or so, depending on your route, is a
delight.
Little mountain villages and towns such as Colfosco, Corvara, Canazei, and
Arabba drift past you all day as you ski from button lift to chair and
gondola to cable car (there are more than 200 lifts to choose from), pausing
at one of scores of mountain restaurants and huts for lunch or refresh-ment.
What makes the tour so enjoyable are the ever-changing mountain vistas. The
towering massifs create an almost prehistoric arena. Yet skiers on this
whistle-stop tour between the Sella, Pordoi, Campolongo and Gardena passes
probably give little thought to what might lurk above them in the craggy
heights.
Those who like their runs a little tougher hike up on skins to finds out.
Now you can do it the easy way: hitch a ride on a helicopter.
The Val di Mesdi run is certainly not as challenging as the Jaws of Death
but still daunting for the average recreational skier.
It starts at 9,280ft on the rim of a craggy inverted archway near the summit
of Sas Pordoi, another of the towering peaks in the Gruppo Sella, which
dominate the Selva skyline.
Technically the run is no more serious than Verbier's Mont Fort or the Swiss
Wall at Avoriaz.
What makes it challenging psychologically is its comparative narrowness and
the colossal impact of the sheer walls of dolomite which enclose you in
their mighty embrace.
Fear grabs in the few seconds before you take the plunge, and then you are
lost in the exhilaration, wonder and sweet shock of the descent. One turn at
a time you thread your way down, a tiny speck of humanity in an impossibly
huge landscape.
The scenery was so overwhelming that at one stage. Amin, our Bladon Lines
minder, lay on the snow and gazed trance-like into the sky. From where I was
perched hundreds of feet above I thought he had fallen.
'Are you OK?' I yelled. My words came back at me in a giant echo, punctuated
by the sounds of small stones falling from the battlements somewhere in the
heavens above us.
When we finally reached Colfosco, we had descended well over 4,000 vertical
feet for a mere L90,000 (Pounds 35) each.
Heliskiing - at least a single drop - need no longer be expensive.
Previously, if you wanted to try this hitherto elitist sport, you had to
sign up for a week, or at the very least a day, of flights. In Italy's
Dolomites, more and more small outfits are offering single drops at
realistic prices.
An inexpensive helicopter ride means that skiers whose only concern used to
be whether to ski the Sella Ronda in a clockwise or an anti-clockwise
direction can now get a breathtaking new perspective on the mountains they
know so well from below.
They do not have to ski the Jaws of Death or even the Val di Mesdi - or even
ski at all. They can just stay in the helicopter and gaze down at the
circuit from the air.
A single helicopter lift can have all the joy of a single glass of
champagne: while the rest of the bottle would be wonderful, the first glass
is the one that really hits the spot.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Hi-tech tomatoes come to the
rescue - Clive Fewins on a business that is enjoying its own green shoots of
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last days of the second world war 15-year-old John Drew drove a team
of shire horses on the fertile slopes above the village of Little Witley
near Worcester.
Today the same land produces some of the most hi-tech tomatoes in the
country - but the tomatoes never actually see soil.
They are grown in glasshouses in liquid using a system called hydroponics,
and computers control the watering.
In the past 50 years, Drew has grown a variety of vegetables, salad crops
and flowers on the now redundant soil beneath his glasshouses.
But two years ago the outlook turned bleak: a net profit of Pounds 702 on a
turnover of Pounds 336,000 meant something had to change. What changed was
the crop: Drew decided to produce only cherry tomatoes and things started to
look up.
'Last year was the first time for 10 years that our bank account actually
entered the black - for a short period,' said Drew. It soon entered the red
again when Drew, 65, and his partners - wife Mavis and son Paul, 36 -
installed a Pounds 53,000 half-acre glasshouse and a Pounds 5,000 watering
plant to expand their output for one of their three customers, J. Sainsbury,
the supermarket chain. Safeways and William Low, the northern supermarket,
are the others.
The crop is picked and packaged by a staff that varies from seven at this
time of the year, when the tomatoes are just ripening, to 16 in the summer.
The business - still known by its original name of Haven Nurseries - is
barely recognisable from the one that produced fruit, vegetable and salad
crops on two acres at the bottom of the hill in the early 1950s.
'In those days we worked extremely hard taking produce to the Birmingham
market at 5am, three days a week,' said Drew. 'But life was straightforward
then. If you worked hard, and produced good crops, you made a good profit.
As a plain country bloke who left school at 15 it seemed simple to me. How
things have changed.'
John and Mavis built glasshouses and increased the number of crops they
grew. The business expanded naturally from profits.
'It seems amazing nowadays but we managed without borrowing until 1974,' he
continued. In that year, they borrowed Pounds 2,800 to buy the four acres on
the hillside site where their house and main glasshouses now stand.
'We then used our newly-acquired overdraft to add our biggest glasshouse
yet. The price was Pounds 3,900. All seemed well, so we kept on putting in
glass and growing mainly lettuce and tomatoes. In 1975, when we added
another big glasshouse, things were still rosy, and we were sometimes able
to get up to 50 per cent of the glasshouse cost back using government
grants.
'It was when these grants ended, plus the crucial decision to put in heat,
which immediately added to our overdraft by Pounds 30,000, that things began
to get tight. However, we still managed to add another half acre of glass.
'But it was the end of the 1970s and interest rates had begun to rocket. We
were caught repaying borrowed money at rates of up to 17 per cent. To try
and counter this we added chrysanthemums to our list of crops and decided to
grow them in a big way. We planted up to 20,000 cuttings a week. We saw
chrysanthemums as our salvation as they gave us an alternative crop 48 weeks
of the year. There was healthy demand and a good good wholesale market. We
increased our staff and took on five full-timers, which added to the
overdraft.'
By 1980 the Drews had 3 1/2 acres under glass and half an acre under a
polythene tunnel, but things remained far from healthy.
'The Dutch were benefiting from much cheaper fuel, which gave them a big
price advantage, and we found increasingly that imports from Spain, the
Canary islands, Israel and even Colombia were hitting prices,' Drew said.
'Other flower producers - particularly those growing roses and carnations -
were going out of business.'
The Drews first grew a few cherry tomatoes in 1985. John had heard about
other growers' successes, and also of the plant's profitability. However, a
poor 1986 season plus a mounting overdraft stopped his plans to expand. He
was able to stabilise his cash flow when he changed from oil to coal and
negotiated fixed price contracts with British Coal.
Drew went on: 'By 1990 Chrysanthemum prices on the wholesale market were
lower than 10 years previously.'
The decision to switch entirely to cherry tomatoes was made in 1991. They
already devoted 1 1/2 acres to cherry tomatoes and they were showing a
profit. But the overdraft was up to Pounds 120,000 and the bank was not
happy.
'The only way was forward,' said Drew. 'We had been here all our lives, and
nobody would have wanted to buy the business at that time as so many others
were in the same boat.
'However, we urgently needed another Pounds 30,000 to replace a glasshouse
and to computerise all our cherry tomato production processes.
'We got the money. Fortunately we had a few savings, and our main suppliers
agreed to extend their period of credit from 30 to 60 days. We honoured the
new agreements but the upshot was that once all the new equipment was in
place we had to re-establish ourselves as customers. In future we knew we
had to pay up front, which meant another massive cash flow crisis.'
The Drews put their case to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation which
agreed to advance Pounds 35,000 over 10 years at a fixed rate of 8.5 per
cent.
'We are now back to our agreed Pounds 90,000 bank overdraft, and profit at
the end of 1993 was Pounds 75,000 on a turnover of Pounds 508,000,' said
Drew. 'I don't think it is marvellous as it merely reflects the higher value
crop. But it is a great improvement on the last few years and I am pleased
we had the confidence to invest in the new half-acre glasshouse.'

pensions.
Financial strength: Standard &amp; Poor's assessment is 'good'
Funds under management: Pounds 73.5bn (at 31/12/93)
Premium income 1993: Pounds 7.9bn worldwide, Pounds 4.1bn UK (broadly life
and pensions)
Number of personal pension plan clients: 870,000

force, under 3 per cent through independent advisers.
Commission paid: For advisers, up to industry average, eg approx 60 per cent
of value of first years' premiums on long-term regular premium plan; less
for salesforce.
Nil commission terms available? Only through independent advisers.
Expense ratio: (management expenses divided by total premium income) 38.66
per cent in 1992, 21.61 per cent in 1991, (industry average in 1991 was 19.3
per cent)
Reduction in yield*: (equivalent annual percent charge over the life of the
contract) Good on direct sales product - 0.7 per cent on 25-year regular
premium unitised with profits plan (industry average 1.3 per cent).
Penalties on early retirement or termination: Yes, based on outstanding
charges for rest of contract (up to 25 years), levied at 5 per cent of first
year's premiums on with-profits plan.
Performance*: With-profits plan just below average for regular premium
contract over five and 10 years, above average over longer terms and

fund just above average over five years but very poor over longer terms.
Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment may
produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance
and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real
charges on the final fund of Prudential's unitised with-profits plan (sold
by direct sales), we asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man
age 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a)
Pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000.
Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than
those used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last
illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were deducted.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Granny bonds stir societies to hit
back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition from National Savings granny bonds has forced building societies
to respond with competitive products. In recent weeks the number of
fixed-term, fixed-rate accounts has increased. These are intended to at
combat savers' worries of continued base rate cuts and lower interest rates.
Last week, the National &amp; Provincial introduced a five-year term account
with 7.3 per cent guaranteed until September 30 1999, paid yearly from
Pounds 500 with a monthly option of 7.10 per cent. And Northern Rock this
week launched a postal bond paying 7.50 per cent monthly from Pounds 5,000
until April 1 1999.
Other societies have introduced escalator bonds in response to savers' fears
of tying into an investment at the bottom of the interest rate cycle.
Although these are still five-year term accounts, the rates are guaranteed
to rise annually.
The Halifax introduced its bond last month and the Britannia and Yorkshire
were quick to follow. The Halifax responded by increasing its rates. This
week has seen the launch of similar bonds from the Newcastle and the Leeds &amp;
Holbeck. The latter starts with rates at 6 per cent, rising by 1 per cent a
year to 10 per cent from Pounds 1,000. All offer a monthly interest option.
Rates on other building society accounts tend to have been tweaked down
lately, although often by very small amounts such as 0.1 per cent. But the
Progressive dropped a bit more and its Tessa (featured recently in the
Savers Selection) is now down to 7 per cent.
Postal accounts still have the edge over branch-based accounts. Britannia
has withdrawn its market-leading index-linked account, which was tied to
inflation rates.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: The Pru goes it alone - Debbie
Harrison looks at a giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential, the largest life assurance company in Britain and the
biggest provider of personal pensions, this week opted for splendid
isolation; it declined to join the Personal Investment Authority, the new
regulator protecting private investors. The Pru has Pounds 73.5bn in assets
under management. It has sold 870,000 personal pensions since 1988; this
represents about one-sixth of the entire market.
The company's representatives used to collect premiums in cash from the
homes of policy-holders. But the 'Man from the Pru' has become more
sophisticated and no contributions are collected in cash now, although the
direct sales force of 9,000 still visits clients' homes to do business.
More than 97 per cent of the Pru's personal pension clients invest in the
company's unitised with-profits contract, sold through the direct sales
force. This product offers good value for risk-averse clients who pay low
contributions. The with-profits fund invests in UK and international
equities, fixed-interest securities, and property. The value of units held
increases by the addition of annual bonuses, plus a final bonus when the
contract ends.
The performance of the unitised with-profits personal pension is
particularly good on single-premium contracts where the fund is in the top
quartile (top 25 per cent) over five and 15 years. On the regular premium
with-profits contract, the fund is either just above or just below average
for all terms.
The charges on the unitised with-profits contract include a 5 per cent
bid/offer spread (initial charge) on all contributions and a policy fee of
Pounds 3 a month on regular premium contracts, or Pounds 20 on each single
premium contribution. To recoup sales and marketing costs and to pay
commission, the company imposes an extra annual charge of 5 per cent of the
value of the units bought during the first year. This is levied for up to 25
years.
Steve Bee, the pensions manager, says: 'This is designed as a long-term
savings product, but it is flexible if people's circumstances change.' If,
for example, a client changes jobs and joins a company pension scheme, he is
no longer allowed legally to pay contributions to the personal pension.
Nevertheless, there would be an early termination penalty under most regular
premium plans.
Several providers waive the penalty if the client contributes instead to
free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs), which are used to
top up the company scheme. The Pru offers this option but also allows the
client to take a break of up to five years - longer, in some cases - before
FSAVC premiums have to start.
Even without this flexibility, the Pru's direct sales with-profits contract
charges are low compared with the industry average. The reduction in yield
figures, which show the equivalent annual percentage charge over the term of
the contract, are among the best available, particularly over 20 and 25
years.
The unit-linked personal pension plan, which is sold through independent
advisers, is not so attractive. Charges are higher and performance has been
poor over all terms and contracts, apart from the five-year regular premium
plan. Bee says: 'Taking a long-term view, the investment performance of our
unit-linked pension funds has not been as good as we would have liked.
However, over the past five years, there has been a marked improvement.'
The Pru has been quick to distance itself from the recent survey on personal
pensions by accountant KPMG Peat Marwick which suggested that nine out of 10
sales of personal pensions used to transfer benefits out of an occupational
scheme did not comply with regulatory requirements. The Pru's transfer
business represents about 9 per cent of total personal pension sales, and
the company's transfer assessment system checks the adequacy of the transfer
value against the level of benefits being given up in a company scheme.
If this is reasonable, the system produces a like-for-like illustration
which can be used to compare directly the personal pension benefits with the
company scheme benefits being surrendered.
Bee adds: 'We always advise against opting out of employers' schemes and we
do not recommend transfers to customers . . . However, we will accept
transfers if customers wish to make them and have no intention of
withdrawing from the market.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Confidence trick?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The local tax office says that any non-capital withdrawals from Tessas or
Peps, although non-taxable, will count as income for age-allowance reduction
purposes. If so, this more than negates the value and purpose of these
investments for many people over 60. What happens on the maturity of a
Tessa, for example? Is this yet another government confidence trick?
Anything which does not form part of your 'total income' for tax purposes
(as defined in section 835(5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988,
as amended) is ignored for age-allowance clawback purposes. Thus, it is not
a case of a government confidence trick - merely of Inland Revenue
incompetence.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mortgage relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I was surprised to see in the article 'Plan to slash your tax bill'
(Weekend, March 12/13), that mortgage interest can get tax relief at a
taxpayer's top rate. I thought that relief was restricted to 25 per cent for
1993/94, followed by 20 per cent for 1994/95 and 15 per cent thereafter.
You can you still get tax relief at your top rate for interest paid on a
loan taken out to purchase a property which you let out at a commercial
rent. The property must be actually let for more than 26 weeks in any 52
week period. When the property is not let, it must either be available for
letting at a commercial rent or unavailable because of construction or
repair work on the property. There is no restriction on the size of the
loan. Generally, the interest can be set off against your rental income.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pre-paying fuel VAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
You said last week that utility customers will have a 'second chance' before
April 1 1995 to avoid paying the full 17.5 per cent VAT rate on household
fuel. Could you explain how this works?
VAT is applied at the rate prevailing when payment is made. Before April 1
this year, each Pounds 100 paid to a utility buys Pounds 100 of fuel,
regardless of when it is actually used. Between April 1 1994 and March 31
1995, it will take Pounds 108 to buy Pounds 100 worth of fuel. From April 1
1995, it will take Pounds 117.50 to buy Pounds 100 of fuel. So, it could be
worthwhile to top up your 'stock' of pre-paid fuel at the 8 per cent VAT
rate just before that date.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT: how to keep those bills within
bounds - In this, the last of four articles on capital gains tax, Richard
Chant and Alan Sugden deal with the rules on gifts and describe various ways
in which you can minimise what you have to pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD CHANT and ALAN SUGDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When gifts of securities are made, other than between husband and wife, any
unrealised gain is treated as a chargeable gain of the donor and is included
in the donor's assessment for CGT. In some circumstances, all or part of the
gain may be held over until the eventual sale by the recipient. The
unrealised gain is calculated using the market value at the time of the gift
instead of the net proceeds of disposal.
Market value
This is the price which the security might reasonably be expected to fetch
on a sale in the open market. The market value of a security listed on the
London Stock Exchange, including the USM, is the lower of:
The bid price of the security plus one-quarter of the spread (the difference
between the bid price and the offer price) which is known colloquially as
'quarter up.'
The figure halfway between the highest and the lowest prices of bargains
recorded that day in the stock exchange's Daily Official List.
For foreign securities listed on a recognised stock exchange, the basis for
calculating the market value is very similar to that for a UK-listed
security; the value is converted into sterling at the exchange rate on the
date of the gift.
Connected persons
These include:
Your relatives and your husband's or wife's relatives.
Your business partners and their relatives, including husbands and wives
(except in relation to acquisitions or disposals of partnership assets
pursuant to bona fide commercial arrangements).
Any company you control.
The CGT rules on gifts and other transfers between connected persons deem
disposals and acquisitions between them to have taken place at market value
whenever they are made, other than by a bargain at arm's length. Subject to
certain exceptions, losses on assets transferred between connected persons
can be set against gains on another disposal to the same person only while
they are still connected.
Holding over a capital gain
When certain assets are given away, or transferred at lower than market
value, the gain may be held over until the eventual sale of the asset. The
assets concerned are gifts of business and heritage property, gifts to
discretionary trusts, and gifts to most political parties. The amount of the
held-over gain depends on several factors: Where a gift is made, or where
the consideration does not exceed the cost, the held-over gain is (with
certain exceptions) the gain calculated under normal CGT rules.
Where the consideration exceeds the cost, the held-over gain will be reduced
by the amount of the excess.
An election for a gain to be held over must be made within six years of the
year in which the gift or transfer was made. It has to be made by the donor
and recipient jointly - unless the recipient is a trustee, who can make it
alone.
MINIMISING YOUR TAX LIABILITY
Bed and breakfast
This is what happens when you sell all or part of a holding in your
portfolio to realise a chargeable gain or to establish an allowable loss,
and then buy it back again (because you do not actually want to reduce or
dispose of the holding).
Neither the Inland Revenue nor the stock exchange publish any rules or
guidelines on B&amp;B, so it has been something of a grey area. But here are
some guidelines: A B&amp;B should be two real transactions, exposed to risk.
The bargain dates on the contract notes should not be the same.
The price of the re-purchase should not be agreed in advance.
The deals should be done within normal market hours (that is, you should
sell before 4.30 pm and re-purchase after 8.30 am the following day).
Stamp duty of 0.5 per cent must be paid on the re-purchase. We would expect
the broker to charge you, say, 0.5 to 1 per cent on the sale (if you are a
good client) but none on the re-purchase.
When would a B&amp;B be worth considering?
To make a chargeable gain when you have not used up all your annual
exemption (Pounds 5,800 in 1993/94). Remember that any unused portion of
that exemption cannot be carried forward.
To make an allowable loss when your chargeable gains have exceeded your
annual exemption.
While bed and breakfasting is a grey area, it can sometimes help to reduce
or eliminate your CGT liability. But remember that indexation is not going
to be allowed to turn a chargeable gain into an allowable loss, or to
increase an allowable loss, on disposals on or after November 30 1993.
Married couples
Since separate taxation for husband and wife was introduced from the 1990/91
tax year, married couples are taxed independently on their capital gains,
and each gets a separate annual exemption.
Transfers between husband and wife
Such transfers do not lead to an immediate CGT charge - providing they are
living together at any time in the tax year. They are treated as living
together unless they are:
Separated under a court order or separation deed.
Living apart in circumstances which make permanent separation likely.
Normally, the partner receiving the asset is treated as having acquired it
at the giving partner's original cost plus indexation to the date of the
transfer, rather than at market value at the time of transfer.
Taking advantage of separate annual exemptions
Transferred holdings being assessed at original cost (plus indexation) to
the date of transfer can be particularly valuable when, in any tax year, a
husband or wife expects to exceed his or her annual CGT exemption and the
other partner does not.
Take a husband whose marginal rate of income tax is 40 per cent and wishes
to sell 12,000 shares in, say, ICI. He calculates that the capital gain on
selling will, after indexation and selling costs, be Pounds 11,600. So, if
he sells all of them himself, he will have to pay CGT on Pounds 11,600 minus
the annual exemption of Pounds 5,800 - a bill of Pounds 2,320.
But suppose that, instead of selling all 12,000 shares himself, he gives
half his holding to his wife. Each then sells 6,000 shares, making a
chargeable gain of Pounds 5,800. This uses up each one's annual exemption.
Thus, the transfer of the shares to his wife saves the husband paying that
Pounds 2,320.
An alternative way to take maximum advantage of separate exemptions is for
husband and wife to own a joint portfolio, although this is not as flexible
as separate portfolios. Where a married couple own shares jointly, they are
assumed to own them 50/50.
Taking advantage of a partner's lower marginal rate of tax
Where a spouse has little or no income, it can also be of considerable
advantage to arrange for that partner to make the bulk of the capital gains.
Say a husband's marginal rate of tax is 40 per cent and his wife has no
income. They decide they would like to buy a country cottage for their
retirement before property prices start recovering. To raise the money, the
husband will have to sell his portfolio of shares in the present tax year,
1993/94. Doing so will produce capital gains of about Pounds 40,000.
He decides he can either sell all the shares himself (table 1, case A) or
sell enough shares to make Pounds 5,800 of capital gains and give the rest
of his portfolio to his wife to sell (case B). The tax payable in each case
is shown in table 1. In case B, there is Pounds 6,000 less tax to pay than
in case A - enough, perhaps, to pay for most of the repairs and redecoration
the cottage needs.
How to transfer assets between husband and wife
Write to the companies registrar, explaining that you wish to give your
shareholding to your husband or wife. The registrar will send you a stock
transfer form (STF), which you complete and return together with your share
certificate. He will then issue a new share certificate in your partner's
name.
There is no transfer stamp payable if the shares are transferred as a gift.
Any sum paid by the transferee is ignored, and the cost to the transferee
for CGT purposes is the transferor's original cost plus indexation to the
month of the transfer.
Gifts to children
All UK residents, including children, are entitled to the CGT annual
exemption. Capital gains on assets held by a child are assessed on the
child. So if, in any tax year, its capital gains are no more than the annual
exemption, there will be no tax to pay.
If, for example, the capital gains on a child's assets are Pounds 5,800 in
the present year and the donor of the assets is a 40 per cent taxpayer who
has already used up his or her annual exemption, the CGT saved would be
Pounds 5,800 x 0.4 = Pounds 2,320. (See table 2 for an example of a husband
and wife with two children).
While assets may be held outright by the child, normally they are held in
the name of the parents (or other donor), as nominee, for the child's
benefit.
Any income is assessable on the parents until the child reaches 18 unless
(a) the income from assets given by the parents is less than Pounds 100 a
year or (b) the donor of the asset was not one of the parents.
Accumulation and maintenance trusts may also be used to invest assets on a
child's behalf. Once settled, the assets are treated as assets of the
trusts, and income and gains may be liable to tax at a rate higher than that
of the donors.
The tax advantages of gifts to children can be very useful but there are
possible drawbacks. One is that frequent gifts by parents may be regarded by
the Revenue as an avoidance of tax by them: the distinction between tax
avoidance and tax planning is very fine. Another is that the Revenue could
assess a child's tax liability on the person who has control or management
of its assets if it is under 18. A third is that the assets held by, or on
behalf of, children may become rather more substantial than the donor(s) had
expected.

capital gains tax)

        28,400                    Wife's total CGT 7,680
Tax saved in Case B = Pounds 13,680 - Pounds 7,680 = Pounds 6,000
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 2: Gifts to children
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
A married couple, both paying a marginal rate of income tax of 40%,
have a son and a daughter, both under 18. In 1990 the parents had Pounds
50,000 available, which they might have invested in one of three ways:
1. Pounds 25,000 in each of their own names, or
2. in their joint names, or
3. in their names as nominee for the children.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1993/94 the Pounds 50,000 investment was sold for Pounds 70,000 net
of expenses. By the month of disposal the cost of the investment had
risen with indexation to an indexed cost of Pounds 56,400. So the
capital gain = Pounds 70,000 - Pounds 56,400 = Pounds 13,600. The
parents had each used up their annual CGT exemption and had no losses
carried forward.
Let us look at the CGT payable, firstly if they had invested the Pounds
50,000 in their own names or in their joint names, and secondly if they
had invested it in their children's names.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Own or joint names
                              Husband             Wife
Capital gain             Pounds 6,800     Pounds 6,800
CGT at 40%                      2,720            2,720
Total tax payable Pounds 5,440
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Children's names
Assuming each child's own income was less than the annual personal
allowance, and remembering that CGT cannot be offset against any unused
personal allowance:
                                  Son         Daughter
Capital gain             Pounds 6,800    Pounds 6,800
Annual exemption               (5,800)         (5,800)
                                1,000           1,000
CGT paid at 20% rate              200             200
Total tax paid = Pounds 400. Tax saving compared with parents investing
in their own or in joint names = Pounds 5,040.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is also a potential advantage on inheritance tax, providing the
donor survives for sufficient years after making the gift to avoid it
being aggregated with the donor's estate.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (9): Paid-up members of the black-pack -
Lucia van der Post runs her eye over the fashion designers / The designers'
wardrobes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing about the world of haute couture - or even its humbler relation,
ready-to-wear - is amenable to the rational laws that govern so much else.
This, of course, is part of its charm. Take the designers. There they are
building businesses - and sometimes lucrative global empires - in which
success depends on persuading people that they need new clothes. Their very
existence depends on change, on imbuing dress with excitement and
innovation, with generating an imperative to embrace the new and the
different.
What then, might the novice observer of the scene ask, do they wear? Are
they founts of originality, of quirky creativity, of visual excitement?
The answer is that they are the most conservative dressers around. Mostly
they evolve a personal style early in their creative lives and stick with
it. Show me a plain cashmere jumper, a simple T-shirt, an ancient
bomber-jacket or an old pair of jeans and in it probably lurks a designer
even now persuading some fashion victim in a far-flung city to part with
more money than most of us would consider wise.
Designers, like fashion editors (their judges and jury), have a strong
penchant for black and there is a perverse pride in not being caught in
anything new.
Even snappier dressers, those who go in for a little colour, such as
Christian Lacroix and Gianni Versace, tend to be seen endlessly in the same
garment.
Of all the black-pack members Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons, is probably
the most stalwart member. She has been known to change her seemingly endless
succession of black shrouds for a crisp white shirt (worn with - you've
guessed it - black trousers) but only on rare occasions.
Most women designers, for obvious reasons, work more or less with their own
image in mind. Sonia Rykiel, lean as a whippet and given to wearing wide,
floaty-legged trousers teamed with skimpy little jumpers, is a paid-up
member of the black-pack who makes clothes for other whippets. When she
comes out on the runway what you see first is the cloud of red-hair but then
you notice the shades of black relieved only by a belt with words such as
Love, Paris or, for the slow-witted, Rykiel.
Caroline Charles, who understands perfectly the clothes that should adorn
the English social season, is hardly ever seen in the colours that
complement her customers' complexions so well. From the top of her chic
little black head to the bottom of her impeccably-cut, long, narrow,
cigarette trousers, it is usually black all the way.
While Donna Karan seems to require inordinate amounts of black, Jean Muir is
famous for never wearing anything but navy. 'It simplifies the matter of
dressing and packing,' she says. This is perfectly true and a good motto for
those whose aim and object is the simplification of dressing and packing.
Katharine Hamnett, in her army fatigue trousers and a T-shirt that looks as
if it has seen better days, manages to make many of us feel over-dressed,
while Betty Jackson wears her own clothes with so much panache that, as one
fashion editor put it, 'when you see them, you want them'.
For those who think the matter of clothes should be invested with a whiff of
danger, a sense of potential disaster, Vivienne Westwood is the designer to
watch. She wears her own designs and these vary from improbably neat
twinsets and pearls, which could have come straight from the stodgiest of
stores, to a transparent figure-hugging body sheath (and who among those of
us who saw it can forget that embarrassing matter of the fig-leaf?).
When it comes to men, the garments most frequently seen after the catwalk
show ends are jeans and T-shirts. Even Gianni Versace, king of Glitz, at the
party he gave for the opening of his Bond street shop, turned up in a pair
of jeans, although in honour of the event he teamed it with a
brightly-patterned silk shirt.
After his shows Claude Montana wears the same old beaten-up leather jacket
(much akin to a biker's jacket) and tight jeans. Karl Lagerfeld, of course,
wears a pony-tail and with it a sharply-cut and expensive suit, contrasting
shirt and tie (white on black) which, in spite of its impeccable designer
lineage, brings to mind nothing so much as Chicago gangster-style.
Jean-Paul Gaultier wears beaten-up old jeans, a T-shirt (often of matelot
stripes), some sort of leather blouson jacket (biker imagery is strong among
the frock-designing set) and brilliantly dyed blond hair.
Yves Saint-Laurent these days requires careful tailoring to hide a
less-than-lean silhouette. When his fragile health allows him to make it on
to the runway he normally wears a good grey suit, shirt and tie - classic
and flattering.
For those who value eccentricity above classicism John Galliano is the
designer to watch. He is addicted to gruesome little shorts which he teams
with some sort of T-shirt and a jacket with some historical provenance, say
a 19th century hussar's jacket worn casually slung over the shoulder. The
whole is frequently topped by some bizarre head-gear - Russian fur hats are
a favourite.
The one almost inviolate rule that unites them all is that whatever a
designer wears it must on no account be new. Issey Miyake in his jeans and
his indigo cotton shirt, Giorgio Armani, in jeans and white cotton T-shirt
in summer, navy-blue cashmere in winter, Calvin Klein in his laid-back tweed
suit and white cotton T-shirt - the message they convey is loud and clear.
If in doubt dress down. Invest in quality classics about which you never
need to think and then you can get on with the more important things of life
 -such as living. Perhaps there is a lesson in there somewhere.
