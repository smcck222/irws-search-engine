China plans to issue Yn5.5bn (UDollars 634m) worth of domestic shares this
year to enliven its flagging securities markets. The planned figure is the
same as last year.
This only refers to A-shares for Chinese nationals. No figure was provided
for USDollars -denominated B-shares, restricted to foreigners.
'The figure has been set after fully considering the stock market's
capacity,' said Mr Ma Zhongzhi, a senior official of the State Council's, or
cabinet, Securities Policy Committee. He said 22 Chinese companies have been
selected for overseas listing this year. Officials said these were
preliminary choices and it was likely that only a few on the shortlist
ultimately would be allowed to list abroad.

FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: MIM and Musto sign deal to

<TEXT>
MIM, the Queensland-based mining company, has signed a definitive
joint-venture agreement with International Musto Exploration of Vancouver to
develop the rich Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit in Argentina.
The agreement is a setback to Metall Mining, the international mining arm of
Germany's Metallgesellschaft, which announced a CDollars 332m (USDollars
251m) hostile takeover bid for Musto last week in the hope of gaining
control of the Alumbrera property.
Metall was due to launch a tender offer for Musto shares on Friday, but the
company said it was weighing its options. One condition of the Metall offer
was that Musto should not dispose of any large part of Alumbrera.
Metall said the agreement with MIM appeared to make Musto less attractive as
a takeover target.
Alumbrera is reputed to be one of the world's richest unexploited copper and
gold ore areas.
The cost of developing a mine has been put at USDollars 600m.
MIM - which would be the operator of the mine - said it had raised the
Alumbrera's projected output to 70,000 tonnes a day from 60,000 tonnes a
day.

group

<TEXT>
Portugal is seeking Es63bn (Dollars 360m) from the privatisation later this
year of Secil/CMP, a cement producer, even though there were no bids for the
company at Es59bn in a first attempt at privatisation in 1993.
The government said limits on foreign investment would be lifted. He said
the state no longer planned to retain a golden share giving it a veto over
corporate decisions.
Bids are being sought for 80 per cent of the state's 58 per cent holding in
Secil and its 100 per cent holding in CMP (Companhia de Maceira e Pataias).

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading executives of MG Refining and Marketing, the US oil and gas arm of
Metallgesellschaft group, the troubled German mining and metals
conglomerate, have been sacked and a number of senior subordinates have been
suspended.
Mr W. Arthur Benson, and his son, Mr William Benson, were sacked 'for
cause,' the company said. In addition, a number of the senior Mr Benson's
subordinates at MG Refining and Marketing have been suspended from their
jobs.
Mr Arthur Benson was president of MG Refining and Marketing until
mid-December, when he was relieved of his executive duties in the wake of an
investigation by Metallgesellschaft into the unit's oil and gas dealings and
related hedging strategies.
Sources said he was not asked to leave at that time because his knowledge
was needed to sort out the company's tangled busin-esses.
Mr William Benson served as a senior vice-president and risk manager for MG
Refining and Marketing.
Metallgesellschaft was gripped by a severe liquidity crisis late last year
largely as a result of problems in the US. The crisis led to the replacement
of the group chief executive.

FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: RWE buys three energy units from
Treuhand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RWE Energie, Germany's largest utility, has strengthened its position in
eastern Germany's energy industry by purchasing three regional utilities
from the Treuhand privatisation agency.
RWE has acquired majority stakes in the ESAG utility at Cottbus in the
eastern state of Brandenburg, WESAG in Leipzig, and a smaller stake in EVS,
which is in the Saxon city of Chemnitz.
It will invest DM2.6bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in the companies over five years and
guarantee 4,750 jobs until the end of 1998. The investments will be used for
modernising and upgrading the utilities.
The deals give RWE a virtual monopoly in the generation and distribution of
energy in this part of eastern Germany largely because of the electricity
contract between the former west and east German governments.
Under the terms of the contract, west Germany's utility companies are
legally permitted to own 51 per cent of eastern Germany's 15 utilities, with
the remaining 49 per cent held by the eastern municipalities.
However, in order to underwrite investments of about DM46bn by western
German utilities, the contract stipulated that eastern German utilities must
buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag, a leading east Germany utility.
Veag is controlled by western Germany's eight electricity companies,
including RWE which holds the largest stake in Veag.
Later this year, Veag is expected to be sold by the Treuhand to west
Germany's utilities, while Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal subsidiary, is
leading a western German consortium to buy eastern Germany's Laubag brown
coal fields.

FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander rises 17.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander increased net income in 1993 by 17.8 per cent to Pta77.9bn
(Dollars 557m), cementing its position as front runner in the race to take
control of the Banesto group should the troubled banking conglomerate be
sold later this year.
Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, told the annual meeting on Saturday that he was
studying the advisability of making an offer for Banesto. But he reassured
the shareholders that the final decision would be dictated by the impact of
such a acquisition on Santander's profits.
Mr Botin was speaking after disclosing extraordinarily good results by
Santander which underlined the strength of its balance sheet and its
position as Spain's leading bank.
Net interest income rose 19.3 per cent to Pta242.6bn and operating income
improved 12.8 per cent to Pta137.6bn. Average total assets increased by 34
per cent to Pta8,081bn.
Mr Botin told shareholders their dividend would be going up by 12.3 per cent
to Pta292 per share.
Mr Botin said the results reflected the diversification of the group's
business in financial services, corporate and retail banking as well as the
geographical spread of its activities. Business outside Spain, mainly in the
US, Chile, Mexico and Puerto Rico, contributed 42 per cent to profits.
The group would continue to expand abroad this year, Mr Botin said. He hoped
its profits this year would be shared 50-50 between domestic and foreign
earnings.
'If buying Banesto means I cannot buy a bank in America, then I will not buy
Banesto,' Mr Botin said. 'The all-important consideration (over a Banesto
offer) is the price.'
Under a rescue plan designed by the Bank of Spain - which is subject to the
approval of Banesto's shareholders - Banesto is to be recapitalised by a
Pta180bn rights issue and subsequently sold to a domestic banking group.
Banesto was the fourth largest Spanish bank. The Bank of Spain intervened at
the end of last year after an inspection revealed it had heavily overvalued
its assets.
Banco Exterior de Espana, part of the Argentaria state financial group,
reports pre-tax profits little changed at Pta42.7bn for 1993, against
Pta41.4bn a year earlier.

FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: EIB bites the bullet with first
Greek drachma bond - A look at investors' appetite for the high coupon
likely to be offered by the first international drachma bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Years of planning are about to bear fruit as the European Investment Bank
prepares to issue the first international Greek drachma bond.
'We have been trying to tap the Greek drachma market for many years, but for
one reason or another we had to keep postponing our plans,' said Mr Ulrich
Damm, who heads the supranational agency's capital markets department.
Now those obstacles have been overcome, largely because the EIB was able to
find two back-to-back borrowers in Greece who wanted to draw down loans in
Greek drachma, he said.
'We will definitely come to the market,' Mr Damm said. The EIB today will
hold a presentation for investors and banks in Athens, and the issue is
expected on Thursday.
The EIB plans to issue Dr10bn of 5-year bullet bonds. According to sources
in the Eurobond market, the bonds are likely to pay a coupon of 17 3/4 per
cent. They will be listed in Athens and Luxembourg and cleared through
Euroclear and Cedel. Midland Bank Athens (part of the HSBC Group) and the
Greek state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETBA) have arranged
the deal.
Many compare the fledgling drachma bond market with the southern European
markets of the late 1980's. 'Back then, those currencies offered
double-digit coupons, but now Italy and Spain pay about 7 1/2 per cent and
Portuguese bonds offer about 8 1/2 per cent, so paper yielding 17 per cent
to 18 per cent will attract investors' attention,' said HSBC's Mr Mark
Bucknall.
Until now, foreigners haven't had easy access to the Greek bond market.
Moreover, they have been put off by the unavailability of fixed-coupon bonds
with maturities of more than one year.
The Greek government issues bonds with maturities of up to seven years, but
bonds with maturities above one year pay floating interest rates. Their
coupons are pegged to the rate on 12-month Treasury bills, which is
regularly set by the Greek central bank. With one-year Treasury bills
currently yielding 19.75 per cent, a five-year bond pays 200 basis points
above that - 21.75 per cent.
The Greek government bond market is relatively illiquid, although increased
over-the-counter inter-bank trading has begun improving the liquidity of
some government bonds, especially at the shorter end of the maturity
spectrum.
Greece does most of its borrowing domestically, although it has been an
active issuer in the Japanese samurai market in recent years. It is said to
be talking with the US Securities Exchange Commission about plans for a
Yankee bond issue. The country regularly issues bonds linked to Ecu, US
dollar, sterling and D-Mark which pay the interest rate a borrower with an
equivalent rating would pay in each of these currencies.
Many hope that the EIB's bond will open the market for other borrowers as
well as whetting investors' appetites for drachma bonds.
'The EIB bond is a relatively small issue, but I expect other issuers to
follow,' said a senior Athens banker. 'The big question is whether the Greek
government will start issuing longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds.' Indeed,
Greece's large budget deficit is likely to ensure that supply won't dry up.
Falling inflation and interest rates are likely to yield to solid capital
gains on drachma bonds. Inflation is likely to have dropped to about 11 per
cent in January, from 12.1 per cent in December, and is expected to fall to
10 per cent this year. Meanwhile, the Greek central bank recently cut its
12-month Treasury bill rate by  1/2 point to 19.75 and its 3-month Treasury
bill rate by one point to 17 per cent.
Of course, investors should bear in mind the currency risk associated with
drachma holdings. While Greece is a member of the European Monetary System,
the drachma is not in the ERM and has slipped steadily against most European
currencies over the years. According to the OECD, the drachma depreciated by
about 8 1/2 per cent per year over the past two years.
However, according to HSBC's Mr Bucknall, 'many investors are prepared to
take a currency risk if it's compensated by a big yield pick-up over the
market they're based in'. Thus, for a D-mark based investor receiving a 5
1/4 per cent yield on five-year notes, the interest-rate differential is so
large that 'the currency has to devalue substantially before he starts
losing money,' says Mr Bucknall.
Elsewhere in the Eurobond market, the EIB is rumoured to be considering a
Pta60bn (Dollars 428m) issue this week, which would make it the largest deal
in the matador market to date.

FT  07 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pentos to seek high street rent reductions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the troubled specialist retailing group which includes the Dillons,
Ryman and Athena chains, plans to renegotiate the rent on some of its high
street stores.
The move, part of a series of measures designed to cut costs and improve the
group's performance, has emerged from a wide-ranging review ordered by Mr
Bill McGrath who formally took over as chief executive at the start of last
month.
As part of the strategic review, which is due to be completed by the end of
February, Pentos has been examining the costs of its 500 stores around the
UK, focusing on those where rental costs are substantially out of line with
current market prices.
Yesterday the company confirmed that Mr Frank Brazier, chief executive of
Pentos Retailing, had written to its landlords telling them that it had been
forced to pay December rents in three delayed payments because of 'the
unstainable burden' placed on the group's cash flow by losses in the three
high street store chains. In the letter Mr Brazier also warns landlords that
the group will be 'seeking their assistance in terms of rent concession
which will be requested shortly to enable the survival of the group.'
However, Mr Brazier's letter - and the unilateral decision to delay December
rent payments in particular - appears to have angered many landlords just at
a time when the group urgently needs their co-operation in reducing its cost
base.
Although Mr Brazier discussed the broad issue with Mr McGrath the new chief
executive favours consultation rather than confrontation and is understood
to be concerned about the impact of the letter.
In mid-December Sir Kit McMahon, who replaced Mr Terry Maher as Pentos'
chairman, warned that the group would incur a 'substantial' loss before tax
and exceptional items this year and pass the final dividend. He blamed the
expected deficit on tough trading conditions and, in particular, losses at
the Athena poster shops and increased interest costs.
Sir Kit added that 'substantial write-downs and charges will be necessary
and will be taken as exceptional losses in the current year.' Analysts are
expecting Pentos to announce pre-tax losses of around Pounds 40m for 1993,
including about Pounds 30m of exceptional charges.

Shareholders in M&amp;G Group, the unit trust company, have overwhelmingly
approved a controversial executive share option scheme which allows exercise
without any reference to performance criteria.
The scheme had been opposed by the National Association of Pension Funds,
one of the UK's largest shareholder groups, which has urged companies to set
performance criteria for the exercise of options that tied rewards for
executives more closely to rewards for shareholders.

Inspec Group heads for market with Pounds 100m valuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Inspec Group, a speciality chemicals company bought from British Petroleum
by a management team for Pounds 40m only 18 months ago, should be valued at
over Pounds 100m when it floats on the stock market in the next two months.
The flotation is expected to raise about Pounds 50m via a placing of shares
combined with either a public offer for sale or an offer through financial
intermediaries.
Even by the standards of recent management buy-out flotations the investors
will have done well. The venture capital backers, led by Advent
International, will have seen the value of their investment more than double
while the stake held by management and staff, for which they paid around
Pounds 600,000, could be valued at over Pounds 15m. That will make it one of
the most successful examples of the Bimbo - the increasingly fashionable
combination of management buy-in and buy-out.
The management is headed by chairman Mr John Hollowood, 58, a former Oxford
research fellow who has already made one fortune from speciality chemicals.
In 1984 he sold Fine Organics, the drug intermediates business he founded,
to Laporte for almost Pounds 8m. He stayed with the company and joined
Laporte's acquisitions team before retiring in 1990. 'I played a lot of golf
but soon got bored.'
Despairing of any improvement in his handicap, he teamed up with Mr Jim
Ratcliffe, 41, a chemical engineering graduate who, after a career spanning
the London Business School, Esso and Courtaulds, had moved into venture
capital with Advent.
They started approaching the many large chemical and oil companies which
were looking to sell their specialist chemicals subsidiaries. A year later
they clinched the BP deal.
'Some people have accused us of being lucky to find this business, but we
looked at 25 different companies,' says Mr Ratcliffe, who left Advent to
become group managing director of Inspec.
However, there is no denying that their timing was fortunate. BP needed cash
and was under pressure from the City to speed up its disposal programme.
Better still, it was just completing a major restructuring of its fine
chemicals arm which included the closure of its site at Carshalton in London
and the transfer of production to its other plant at Hythe on Southampton
Water. In a successful attempt to return the business to profit BP had
invested Pounds 13.7m at Hythe and rationalised both the product line and
the workforce.
'We got a very good chemistry set and some very good people,' says Mr
Ratcliffe. Eleven of the senior managers joined the buy-out and now 85 per
cent of the 150 staff at Hythe own shares.
The BP legacy also included some very strong market positions in specialist
products such as dimethyl isophthalate (DMIP), a key ingredient for the
making of PET plastic bottles. Inspec, the world's biggest manufacturer, has
80 per cent of the growing European DMIP market and is making inroads in
east Asia. It is also the world leader in hydroxy monomers which provide the
high gloss finish for car paints.
Despite its exposure to the motor industry, which provides over a fifth of
its sales, and to continental Europe, which accounts for well over half,
Inspec has grown strongly since the new team took over. Helped by sterling's
devaluation turnover rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 49m in 1993 with
operating profit from continued activities up by more than half to Pounds
7m. At 14.3 per cent its operating margins are among the fattest in the
sector while its profit per employee of Pounds 41,000 is more than double
that of its nearest quoted rival, Allied Colloids.
The statistics have improved further following December's Dollars 20m
(Pounds 13m) acquisition of Allco Chemical, an American speciality chemicals
company which boasts operating margins of 36 per cent.
Thanks to its strong trading and modest capital investment needs Inspec
managed to fund virtually all the Allco purchase price from cash flow. Most
of the funds raised in the flotation, to be handled by merchant bank Morgan
Grenfell with brokers Cazenove, will be used to pay off expensive buy-out
debt.
Freed from that burden the company could contemplate bigger deals, but Mr
Hollowood lays more stress on expanding the existing business.
'The easiest way to increase our profits is to fill up our plant at Hythe
which is operating at only 67 per cent capacity.'
He sees good growth prospects for its newer products such as DMB, a starting
material for synthetic musk which provides the 'stay-fresh' smell for
detergents. Even Inspec's most mature business, synthetic lubricants, is
growing well thanks to the development of new applications. Potentially most
exciting are the patented oil-soluble polyethers which, when added to
ordinary mineral oil, are claimed to give it the characteristics of totally
synthetic engine oils - for half the price.
Mr Ratcliffe says that several major oil companies are now testing the
product which BP spent Pounds 3m developing. 'If it is successful it could
be a very substantial business. We will know in about three years time.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience, the pharmaceutical group which is coming to market through a
30m share placing and offer for sale, has received a mixed initial reception
from investors.
The institutional placing of 16.7m shares priced at 150p a share was
oversubscribed about three times. However, Robert Fleming, which sponsored
the issue, only received applications for 10.8m shares under the offer for
sale, representing just over 80 per cent of the shares available.
As a result all valid applications will be satisfied in full, including
priority applications for 18,100 shares received from employees.

FT  07 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at Lancashire Enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised regeneration company formerly owned
by Lancashire county council, is to form a national economic development
company.
The new company will operate partnerships with construction companies and
local authorities based on its successful Lancashire model.
LE, which floated in 1989 to head off government restrictions on trading by
councils, has had four years of profitable expansion, with turnover growth
from Pounds 6m to Pounds 15m. Pre-tax profits rose from just under Pounds 1m
to Pounds 3m last year.
Its shares, which are traded on a matched bargain basis, were selling at
520p last week, compared with 116p at launch.
LE's basic approach was to capitalise money given by the county council in
1981 and use it to redevelop closed-down factories and old mills in
Lancashire. This provided property income from rent and trading, which was
then channelled into economic development. The Labour-controlled county
council - which has always given cross-party support - got dividends.
A portfolio of start-up and venture capital funds followed, with subsequent
corporate finance activities to help companies grow, as well as consultancy
throughout Europe. LE now employs 270 people and has offices in Manchester,
Brussels, Luxembourg, Ireland, Lublin in Poland, Brno in the Czech Republic,
and Nyiregyhaza in Hungary.
Only a third of turnover is now with Lancashire County Council. Customers
include the EC, UK government, the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
Mr Jim Mason, the chairman, who is a former deputy chairman of the
Co-operative Bank, said yesterday: 'This will be a natural expansion. We
have always acted as a bridge between public and private sectors and it has
been consistently demonstrated that the market is willing to pay a fair
price for our services.'
The new company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, will be called UK Economic
Development Partnership. It will be financed from retained profits.
Ironically, the government's attempts to curb trading by local authorities
triggered the growth: once privatised, LE was able to break out of its
Lancashire base and establish the market for the new company.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Rogers hits snag in Hunter takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty about the ownership of a 17 per cent block of shares in Maclean
Hunter has put an obstacle in the way of Rogers Communications' proposed bid
for the Toronto-based publishing and cable-TV group.
Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable-TV operator, was expected on Friday
to announce the terms of a 'strategic merger' with Maclean Hunter valued at
between CDollars 4bn (Pounds 2bn) and CDollars 4.5bn.
Instead, Rogers said that it would first ask the Ontario Securities
Commission to rule whether it could make an offer for all MH's outstanding
shares without including a parcel of 36.3m shares held by a company known as
Maclean Hunter Holdings.
The commission's decision is expected within a week or two.
The status of the MH shares held by MH Holdings could make a substantial
difference to the cost of a takeover bid, as well as Rogers' ability to
secure majority approval of all MH shareholders for its offer, as required
under a 'poison pill' which MH set up in 1989.
Rogers said the equity of MH Holdings is almost entirely owned by two units
of Maclean Hunter itself, and MH's financial statements treat the shares
held by MH Holdings as if they were not outstanding.
MH Holdings was formed by senior Maclean Hunter managers and former family
shareholders after the parent company went public in the 1960s, apparently
to help thwart a hostile predator. Details of its ownership have never been
revealed.
Rogers believes that by combining their resources, the two companies have a
better chance of standing up to international multimedia conglomerates, as
well as to Canada's powerful telephone companies.
But MH pre-empted its bid early last week by revealing it had received an
unsolicited and informal takeover proposal from the cable-TV operator.
MH has indicated it will not show its cards until Rogers puts a firm offer
on the table.

On Monday Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group, is likely to report
interim pre-tax profits little better than the Pounds 56.2m made in the six
months to December 1992. Nevertheless a small dividend increase is expected.
The difficult area has been consumer foods, where pressure from the
supermarkets has been hitting many food manufacturers. That should have been
offset by improvements in agribusiness, food distribution and ingredients.
Prospects for the second half are better, particularly as recent
acquisitions such as BP's petfood operation, chip in. Even so it will not be
a bumper year.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Granada and LWT may meet this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television and Granada may meet this week to see if agreement
can be reached to end the hostile takeover confrontation between the two.
On Saturday Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of Granada which has made a hostile
bid worth around Pounds 650m for LWT, telephoned Sir Christopher Bland, LWT
chairman, proposing weekend talks.
The LWT executive suggested talks would be better after publication of LWT's
final defence document, due after Friday's clearance of the Granada bid by
the Department of Trade and Industry.
In a circular to shareholders LWT said January advertising revenue reached
Pounds 14.8m, a rise of 10 per cent on last year, viewing figures rose by 5
per cent and GMTV, the commercial breakfast station in which LWT has a 20
per cent stake, was expected to move into profit this year.
'LWT has made an impressive start to the year and we believe the group's
prospects remain excellent,' Sir Christopher said. Granada chief executive
Mr Gerry Robinson replied that all of ITV had a good month in January.
It is unclear how much room there is for talks. LWT would see a 200p a share
improvement in the Granada offer, at present worth around 700p, as a minimum
for recommending a deal. Granada would regard that as wildly unrealistic
although it is considering sweetening its offer.

expected to announce sharply improved fourth-quarter earnings this week.
US car and light truck sales rose 8.4 per cent in the final three months of
1993 compared with the same period of 1992, and the higher volume has
allowed carmakers to run their plants closer to capacity and reduce the
costly rebates used to sell vehicles during the downturn of the past few
years.
The most interesting part of GM's results will be how much the company has
managed to turn around its bloated North American operations, which lost
Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.30bn) between 1990 and 1992. The mean Wall Street
forecast is for GM to earn around Dollars 1.02 a share, according to IBES,
the securities information service.
The company has set itself a target of at least breaking even in North
America in 1993 before interest, tax and other special charges.
Ford has made big gains in market share in North America over the past year,
helped by strong-selling vehicles, such as the Explorer, and the recently
relaunched, sporty Mustang. Its European operations, which have suffered
severely from recession in Britain, are also on the mend, and the company
recently forecast a return to profits in Europe in 1994.
Wall Street's mean expectation is earnings of Dollars 1.13 a share.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Chemicals still a source of
anxiety as profits rise - British Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum will be the first of the big European integrated oil
companies to report final results for 1993 when it releases its
fourth-quarter figures on Thursday.
Analysts expect after-tax profits from the final quarter of about Pounds
290m - up from Pounds 200m - on a replacement cost basis, which strips out
the losses and gains from stockholding.
But the company could also take a Pounds 200m exceptional charge for
restructuring its troubled European chemicals division. No new chemical
plant closures are expected, but a rationalisation of product lines is
likely.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, has made no secret of his frustration at
the lack of progress being made by the European petrochemicals industry in
cutting its chronic over-capacity.
On the upstream oil and gas side of the business, analysts expect BP to
continue to report success in cost-cutting. That was one of the main factors
underpinning the performance of most of the oil majors in the second half of
the year.
Weak oil prices have so far not affected the viability of any big
development projects, although the company has curtailed some drilling
activity and squeezed suppliers to reduce capital costs. The benchmark Brent
Blend regained some ground last week, but prices of Dollars 14-Dollars 15 a
barrel are still about Dollars 4 down on last year.
Analysts will be keen to ask BP if marketing margins held up during the
fourth quarter. The three biggest US oil groups - Exxon, Mobil and Chevron -
have reported sharply higher refining and marketing earnings for the last
three months of 1993, helping to offset the effects of the fall in oil
prices.
For the year, BP's after-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, are forecast
to have doubled to roughly Pounds 1.1bn on a replacement cost basis.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Beazer Homes flotation to raise Pounds 450m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beazer Homes plans to raise sufficient new money to leave it with
'significant' net cash when it is floated next month.
Hanson, the conglomerate which acquired the whole of Beazer in December
1991, plans to sell all its shares in the float. The new money being raised
could increase the size of the offer to over Pounds 450m.
The extra money will help the company, the fourth largest UK housebuilder,
to expand annual completions from 4,805 in the financial year to
end-September, to 7,000 a year by the late 1990s. It also plans to move
up-market.
According to James Capel, joint broker to the issue, this strategy suggests
annual profits could then exceed Pounds 60m. In its latest financial year
Beazer Homes made an operating profit of Pounds 37.5m.
Yesterday Hanson announced that Mr Victor Benjamin, deputy chairman of
Tesco, the food retailer, and of Lex Service, the car distribution and
leasing group, is to become chairman of Beazer Homes, while Mr David Legg,
joint managing director of GE Capital Europe, part of the US financial
services group, is to be a non-executive director. Another non-executive
will be appointed.
Beazer Homes has not published its balance sheet for September 30 1993, but
James Capel estimates it had net assets at that time of Pounds 120m to
Pounds 130m. Since then it has acquired Walker Homes, a Scottish
housebuilder, for up to Pounds 28.2m, adding 1,488 plots to the land bank,
and bought another 770 plots.
Hoare Govett, lead broker on the issue, and James Capel have each published
pre-prospectus research. Both say that the value of Beazer Homes' land bank,
at Pounds 8,500 a plot, is well below that for other national housebuilders.
Beazer Homes has a bias towards Scotland and the north of England where land
is cheaper.
The low land value follows a Pounds 75.5m write-down of the land bank in the
1992 accounts, part of a Pounds 99.3m provision. Of the Pounds 75.5m, Pounds
49.1m was written off the value of land in the south and Pounds 22.4m
against the Midlands. The provision cut land values to a level where Beazer
Homes could make a 12 1/2 per cent gross margin on houses.
Beazer Homes' land bank, totalling 16,117 plots on December 31 last year, is
also longer than that of its rivals, at 3.4 times last year's completions,
However, James Capel points out that the low written-down value of the land
bank will mean the group's profit margins are likely to rise less sharply as
the market recovers than those of other housebuilders.
A pathfinder prospectus will be issued on February 24, with pricing due on
March 10. Applications for the public offer will close on March 18 with
dealings in the shares starting on March 25.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Privatisation dream turns into nightmare: A Polish bank sale
has exposed a stock market weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The queues twirl and intertwine around the room as people stand waiting to
see a stockbroker in the crowded modern Warsaw office. More people stand in
line in the street outside.
It is a scene reminiscent of Poland's communist past. Yet its cause is the
attempt to create a broadly-based share owning democracy in a newly
capitalist economy.
Similar scenes are repeated every day at most of the 400 or so stockbrokers'
offices throughout Poland in the aftermath of the privatisation of Bank
Slaski, one of Poland's top five banks. The flagship of the Polish
privatisation programme is rapidly turning into a nightmare.
About 800,000 people bought shares in the offer which is threatening to
overwhelm Poland's young stock market established in 1991 with only 30
stockbrokers and a fledgling computer-based trading system.
The consequences of the sale go far beyond the stock market. The Bank Slaski
sale is proving extremely politically controversial. Mr Stefan Kawalec, a
deputy finance minister who sold 25.9 per cent of the equity at the public
offer price of 500,000 zlotys per share to the Dutch ING Bank, has already
been dismissed after protests from the Peasant Party (PSL), part of the
government coalition, that the bank had been undervalued.
The protests have been fuelled by the volatile shifts in the bank's share
price, which rose to 6.7m zlotys per share when first quoted on the Warsaw
Stock Exchange (WSE) on January 25.
Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister who backed Kawalec on the issue, has
since himself resigned leading to a crisis inside the governing coalition
between his Social Democratic (SLD) party and the PSL led by Mr Waldemar
Pawlak, the prime minister.
But the situation is creating a different kind of tension in the queues at
the stockbrokers. Many Poles have had their imaginations fired by a WSE
index which has risen 14-fold over the past year. Having taken to investing
like ducks to water they are finding that the pond has suddenly frozen over.
Most of the people in the queues are there to open accounts with the
stockbrokers to register their shares. Only once they are registered will
they be able to sell them. The delays in registering shares has left
investors frustrated as well as having a huge impact on the share price.
Indeed the most probable reason for the 13.5 times increase in the bank's
stock price when it was first quoted is that so few people were actually in
a position to sell their shares because of delays in registration. Only 0.35
per cent of the issue was traded on the opening day. Since then a mere 3 per
cent of the 3.7m shares sold in the public offer have changed hands.
The finance ministry has demanded that the Bank Slaski explain the delays in
issuing the shares and why it decided to ask the stock exchange to quote the
stock when relatively few investors were actually in possession of their
shares. The Securities Commission is conducting its own investigation into
the case which may focus on the stock exchange's failure to postpone trading
in the shares.
The queues meanwhile are getting increasingly impatient. The share price has
slipped by almost 30 per cent since January 25. But the great mass of
investors, who were allocated three shares each in the oversubscribed offer,
have been unable to sell their stakes. In Gdansk for example the Bank
Gdanski, which has a broking operation, estimates that 50,000 people in the
area have Bank Slaski shares. But the office, the only broker in the city
which is still opening accounts, is processing only 500 a day.
The offer has exposed the weakness of the stock market infrastructure. Last
autumn, before the offer came to the market, there were about 150,000
investment accounts in the country. Analysts estimate that the Bank Slaski
offer will add another 300,000 investors. The offer's oversubscription
suggests the demand is even higher.
That suggests the Polish privatisation process could be caught in a vice. On
the one hand the government and investors are keen to see it go further. The
programme includes the imminent sale of the Krakow based Bank Przemyslowo
Handlowy and a number of other companies.
Workers in companies to be privatised who will receive up to 10 per cent of
the equity free are beginning to become keen on sales.
Yet the danger is that just as privatisation is starting to attract
investors to water, so the limits of the infrastructure will prevent most
from drinking as quickly as they would like.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Major and Smith draw swords: Electoral campaign launched
with differences on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GLASGOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The agenda for local government and European election campaigns was set out
yesterday as Mr John Major and Mr John Smith offered starkly differing views
of Britain's economic prospects.
Mr Major indicated that his hopes for an upturn in the government's fortunes
were pinned firmly on the strengthening economic recovery.
But Mr Smith told nearly 2,000 Labour activists at a rally in Glasgow that
Britain faced low growth, high taxes and unparalleled waste and corruption
under the 'crumbling' Conservative government.
The clash came as the prime minister made clear that he would not quit the
party leadership if - as widely expected - the Conservatives suffer heavy
losses in the council polls in May and the Strasbourg elections the
following month.
Labour received a boost last night with the release of an opinion poll
showing that a majority of voters no longer fears the prospect of a Labour
government.
The Gallup poll, published in today's Daily Telegraph, shows that more than
three-quarters of those questioned said they would welcome or would not mind
the election of a Labour government under Mr John Smith.
In previous periods when the government has been deeply unpopular, large
numbers of voters have remained wary of the prospect of a Labour government.
Separately yesterday, Mr Michael Heseltine, seen as a contender in any fight
for the succession, also moved to quell speculation over the Tory
leadership. The trade and industry secretary told BBC television that he had
'no doubt whatsoever' that Mr Major would win the next general election.
But there was still evidence of high-level tension between the Tory left and
right. Some ministers on the left were privately voicing considerable
satisfaction at the embarrassment suffered by Mr Michael Portillo, the
rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, after his attack on public
standards abroad.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Major said Britain had the fastest
growing economy in Europe and the prospect of overcoming the inflationary
psychology of the past. 'If people want to talk generally about stewardship,
I am very happy to talk about the position the country is in,' he added.
Mr Smith told supporters a future Labour government would implement a
'business plan' focusing on investment, training and jobs 'to lift our
country out of the failures and disillusionment of the past 15 years'.
'We must invest in our country's future, and Labour's business plan for
Britain is, above all, an investment plan to make up for all these years of
Conservative neglect and decline.'
Mr Smith made clear that Labour's election campaigns will focus on taxation,
rising crime, and the alleged appointment of Conservative 'placemen' to
quangos responsible for 20 per cent of public spending.
Mr Smith also called for changes in the style of government, confirming that
allegations of 'Tory sleaze' will play a large part in the campaign.
The next Labour government would use 'all the resources and all the power of
government' to promote an economic revival.

FT  07 FEB 94 / OECD set to criticise UK aid policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy over British aid for the Pergau dam project in Malaysia and
its possible links with a Pounds 1bn arms deal has prompted concern within
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development over the conduct
and formulation of British aid policy.
Sharp criticism of British government aid policy is expected in a report
being prepared by a team of OECD examiners appointed by its development
assistance committee (DAC).
The OECD sets international standards for aid from western governments. Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, reiterated last week that the UK
adheres to its guidelines.
Belgian and Finnish examiners were in London last month collecting data on
the British aid programme. They met Baroness Chalker, Foreign Office
minister responsible for aid, who opposed UK assistance to the Pergau
project on economic grounds.
One senior official who has closely monitored the project for the OECD said
this week: 'We want there to be a strengthening of public and parliamentary
confidence in the UK aid programme. For this you need transparency. You
don't sweep this (Pergau) under the carpet.'
There are allegations that the UK offered Malaysia Pounds 234m of aid for
the construction of the Pergau dam in order to secure a Pounds 1bn arms deal
in 1988. This would have been a clear breach of OECD and government
guidelines. The aid was granted in spite of opposition from Baroness Chalker
and Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Agency (ODA).
The OECD's development assistance committee report will be discussed at a
general meeting on February 24, and will be published within a month. The
committee is examining the extent to which the formulation and management of
British aid policy is effective in terms of achieving the UK's own
objectives.
These objectives, recently submitted to the committee, define the overall
aim of UK aid policy as 'promotion of the sustainable economic and sound
development in order to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty,
suffering, and deprivation.'
Aid to Malaysia appears to have been an anomaly within that policy. Between
1990 and 1993, Malaysia was consistently among the top 20 recipients of
bilateral aid from the UK. However, Malaysia's GNP per head, at Dollars
2,490 (Pounds 1,671), is four times greater than any other top 20 recipient
of aid.
An ODA official said that GNP per head was normally an important determinant
of whether aid was granted to a country. However, Malaysia's aid had not
been provided under a 'country programme' but under the aid and trade
provision, which links the granting of aid to benefits for British trade.
The aid and trade rules were changed last year so that a country as
prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify.
A previous DAC report in April 1991 was critical of UK aid policy, saying
the use of trade-related aid carried 'inherent risks'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has defended Pergau on environmental and
economic grounds, and in terms of job creation and bilateral commitments.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Probe into flight of capital from former Soviet Union
abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international investigation into the flight of capital from former Soviet
Union - currently running at an estimated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) a month
 -has been shelved because of lack of support from the Russian authorities.
The inquiry by Kroll Associates, US corporate private investigators, was set
up by the Russian government amid wide pub-licity in 1992. It had strong
support from the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries, which were formulating aid plans for former Soviet
republics.
Russian officials proclaimed it as showing their commitment to cracking down
on criminal activity and curbing the flight of capital. But with the IMF in
Moscow again considering further Russian demands for help, Kroll has
confirmed the investigation was never completed because of a lack of
support.
One investigator said: 'We spent months talking to western companies and
banks which have been dealing with Russia . . . the file we gathered raised
our suspicions about certain players and institutions (in former Soviet
Union). Our problem is that when we sent it to Moscow it was never followed
up.'
He added: 'Undoubtedly our report turned out to be more political than was
anticipated.'
News of the abandoned investigation has emerged at a time when cash-rich
Russians are reported to be spending heavily in western capitals. According
to Mr Boris Fyodorov, until recently the Moscow government's finance
minister, Russians are moving into the UK property market. Exclusive London
retailers and auction houses also say there is a keen interest in artwork
and jewellery.
While a substantial part of the funds is legitimate, Whitehall officials and
UK regulators are increasingly concerned that London is becoming a centre
for Russian flight capital of dubious legality.
The Institute of International Finance, which represents 175 international
banks, has drawn up the estimate of at least Dollars 1bn leaving Russia each
month, although a significant part of this includes foreign currency legally
deposited by Russian companies into Russian banks which then place it
overseas.

FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been plenty of ink spilt recently on the subject of tax rises and
their blood-curdling impact on consumers. Yet recent work by James Capel
suggests the fears are overdone. While taxes will rise by some Pounds 10.4bn
this year, consumer spending may rise by Pounds 19bn as a result of
increases in income and a rundown of savings.
The question is how this extra money will affect prospects for the retailing
sector. Retail sales tend to be more volatile than overall consumer
spending, since they contain a greater discretionary element. Equally,
non-food retailing tends to benefit from an upturn more because food
purchases are pretty stable. So while Capel's estimate of Pounds 19bn
equates to an increase of 4.7 per cent in consumer spending, the broker
thinks that non-food retailing could grow by 6.5 per cent. Large stores may
do even better. After inflation, quoted stores volumes may rise by almost 4
per cent, only slightly less than the healthy 1993 figure.
Against that, there is much talk of further pressure on margins. Retailers
such as Sir Geoff Mulcahy of Kingfisher have made much of low prices as the
way to lift sales. Sir Malcolm Field of W H Smith has said that this
competition may be more apparent than real. Capel's statistics seem to
support this view. Margins have only fallen slightly in the past three
years, and are expected to remain stable in 1994 and 1995. The squeeze on
prices has been offset by a mixture of fewer discounted sales, better stock
control and improved sourcing. It is companies such as Burton and
ironically, Kingfisher, which still have much of this work to do, that will
find it hardest to offset the pricing pressures.

FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: KLM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the light of the European Commission's recent report on the aviation
industry, KLM's rights issue raises questions about what constitutes state
aid. The Dutch government, which owns 38 per cent of KLM, has agreed to
subscribe for its share of the national carrier's Fl 1bn fund raising. This
stark change to its previous attitude appears to be a response to the
collapse of the Alcazar European collaboration project. Yet rival airlines
will scarcely complain. KLM is among the most market-oriented of all
European airlines. Its rights issue price has been determined by prevailing
stock market conditions.
Air France lies at the other end of the spectrum, being wholly-owned by the
government. Yet in the past, it too has raised money by way of a rights
issue. Not surprisingly, its cash call has been fully taken up by the
government. That looks suspiciously like state aid.
But where is the dividing line to be drawn? The picture grows confused in
cases such as Lufthansa. The German government has a 51 per cent
shareholding in its national carrier and retains obligations over its DM3bn
pension scheme. The government may be keen to privatise Lufthansa fully but
it retains considerable influence over its commercial destiny in the
meantime. The suspicion must be that governments will continue to support
national carriers no matter how hard the European Union tries to ban state
subsidies. Is it really possible to imagine Air France going bust?

FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: HSBC Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something perplexing about the sharp rise of HSBC Holdings,
especially in the light of Friday's tightening by the US Federal Reserve.
Its shares gained 14 per cent last week alone, with much of the driving
force coming from Hong Kong, a market where it has tended to under perform
recently. The reasons must lie deeper than good figures from both its US and
Australian subsidiaries, which make up only a small proportion of its total
business. Yet there are grounds to expect the bank's growth in Hong Kong to
slow. At some stage provisions, which have been negligible in the
Asia-Pacific region, will start to rise again as the Hong Kong property
market cools off.
The attraction to the Hong Kong investor may be that HSBC is insulated by
its ownership of Midland as well as by the relative quality of its local
loan book. Its out-performance in that market could then reflect the idea
that more parochial alternatives are becoming relatively more risky as the
cycle peaks. But the view from the UK should be different. The impact of the
UK recovery should be more strongly felt in the profits of other clearing
banks such as Barclays and National Westminster with a more domestic
orientation.
Admittedly, consensus forecast earnings of around 74p per share this year do
not make a share price of Pounds 10.99 look particularly expensive. The big
uncertainty, though, is how the Hong Kong market will react to the Fed's
move when the dust settles. Its small tightening might make little
difference, either to US investment flows or to the territory's economy. But
as a bank operating in a market whose currency is linked to the US dollar,
HSBC is sensitive to US interest rates.

FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Constricting bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy is both good and
bad news for European bond markets. While its determination to keep the lid
on inflation should ultimately be positive for longer-dated bonds,
uncertainty over interest rates may create nervousness at the shorter end of
the market. In theory there ought to be no reason to prevent transatlantic
interest rate trends diverging. The US economy has been recovering, albeit
patchily, for some time, but continental Europe remains in recession. Even
the UK recovery is not yet entrenched enough to raise worries about capacity
bottlenecks.
Yet much depends on how far the Fed tightening is reflected in a stronger
dollar. The Bundesbank appears increasingly to take the exchange market into
account when making interest rate decisions. It is less likely to cut rates
if the D-mark is weak. Increased caution on this score would raise new
difficulties for other continental countries such as France, which continue
broadly to follow the German example on rates.
The Bundesbank's concern reflects its awareness of the need to attract
capital to finance Germany's large public sector deficit. That need exists
for the UK too, despite the government's diminishing funding requirement.
Bonds would look uncomfortable at a yield discount to their US equivalent if
the dollar strengthens sharply. So would gilts at a premium of only around
half a point.

<TEXT>
Ruffled feathers in the taxation jungle. The two owls at the sides of the
Institute of Taxation's coat of arms are intended to signify the collective
wisdom of the IOT, which comprises some 9,000 of the best brains in British
taxation.
Why two owls? One represents the wisdom of Inland Revenue officials, the
other that of private-sector tax advisers.
Malcolm Gammie, the IOT's president, now says the Revenue owl has 'fallen
off its perch'. The tax advisers' owl is squawking about clause 241 of the
Finance Bill, currently before Parliament. The private-sector tax industry
sees the clause as a backdoor means of the Revenue poking its nose into
their offices uninvited, and even - heaven forfend - removing key papers.
According to Gammie, the offending clause is badly drafted and must be
withdrawn. 'It confers unnecessarily wide powers upon the Inland Revenue and
provides inadequate protection against their exercise'.
So far, the Revenue owl doesn't give a hoot.

Britain's venture capitalists seem to be getting itchy feet. Robert
Drummond, 48, the venture capital industry's answer to BBC TV Troubleshooter
Sir John Harvey-Jones, resigned as chairman of Grosvenor Venture Managers
just before Christmas, and now Jon Moulton, Schroder Ventures' high-profile
managing partner, has quit.
Moulton, who built Schroder Ventures into one of the most successful UK
venture capital firms, has fallen out with his patrons once too often.
Apparently, Schroders wanted tighter controls while Moulton yearned for
greater freedom. A familiar story in an industry which spends its time
backing entrepreneurs with big egos.
Citicorp reached an amicable agreement last year with its venture capital
team, allowing them to set themselves up as an independent company but with
a commitment from the bank to continue providing funds.
Did this tempt Moulton, 42, a former general manager of Citicorp Venture
Capital, to overplay his hand?
Whatever the answer, it sounds like he will not be out of work for long. One
investor has already offerred him Pounds 50m to play with.

Hong Kong's Eastern Express, launched last Tuesday with great fanfare, is

One of its first 'exclusives' was a revelation that a company controlled by
Peter Woo, part of the Sir Y K Pao dynasty, was spying on Li Ka-shing, one
of Hong Kong's richest tycoons.
An eagle-eyed reporter had spotted that a camera situated on the 22nd floor
of Wheelock House was pointing at the China Building across the road, where
Li and son Victor have their offices, and put two and two together.
Sadly, the 10-year-old camera is actually nothing more sinister than an
optical receiver for picking up a real-time data feed from the Hong Kong

FT  07 FEB 94 / Observer: Olympic's Dutch treat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Roula Vlachopoulou took the job of joint managing director of Olympic
Airways' catering business, little did she think that she would become the
focus of attention of an international dispute which is embarrassing the
Greek government's attempts to woo foreign investors.
Mrs Vlachopoulou is a close friend of Mrs Dimitra Papandreou, the socialist
prime minister's wife, dating back to when they were both air stewardesses
with Olympic, the Greek flag carrier. No surprise then to find Mrs V running
Olympic Catering following last October's change of government.
However, the idea that the toughest part of her job would be supervising
in-flight meals for the prime minister and his cronies has been upset by an
ugly legal dispute surrounding one of Greece's first privatisations.
Abela, a Dutch catering company, acquired 49 per cent of Olympic Catering in
1991, and wanted to exercise its option to buy another 17 per cent of the
business before last year's elections.
Olympic prevaricated, fresh faces suddenly appeared in the Olympic
boardroom, and Olympic Catering's top management team was fired. Abela is
now suing Olympic Airways for Dollars 100m for breach of contract.
Unabashed, Mrs V wants to rehire the 900 Olympic Catering staff Abela had
fired in an efficiency drive. Not the sort of action that is going to whet
the appetite of other foreign investors pondering a Greek partnership.
Nor for that matter will it enhance Olympic Airways' own chances of getting
a sympathetic hearing in Brussels the next time the Greek government tries
to bail it out.

FT  07 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: Once more unto the breach - In the
first in a series, FT writers ask if the new confidence of US industrialists
is hiding America's competitive weaknesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, MARTIN DICKSON and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just three years ago, something seemed fundamentally wrong with the
industrial heart of the US. Vital markets such as cars and electronics were
being lost to the Japanese. Auto industry chiefs trooped over to Tokyo to
complain. Tariffs were slapped on Japanese imports of semiconductors. The
popular novelist Michael Crichton wrote a best-seller, Rising Sun,
portraying the US as the supine victim of a business massacre.
But if business is war, the Americans now seem to be winning it. The Detroit
carmakers have made a comeback. The world of high-tech electronics is
dominated by US companies such as Intel and Microsoft. Japanese industry is
in trouble back home. After a nasty period of doubt, America's self-image is
intact.
The obvious question asserts itself. The US was wrong to be so pessimistic
before. Is it overdoing the optimism now?
The answer depends a good deal on who you talk to. The big manufacturers are
mostly convinced the change is real. The 1980s, they say, were Japan's
decade. Japanese manufacturers enjoyed a booming and largely protected
domestic market, virtually interest-free finance and long product cycles
that favoured large volumes and aggressive pricing. Now Japanese markets are
static or shrinking. The collapse of the Tokyo stock market means the cost
of capital in Japan is about the same as elsewhere. At the same time,
international pressure has forced Japan to open its markets to more foreign
competition.
Also, say US industrialists, Japanese corporations tend to be culturally
rigid and structurally monolithic. This makes them very powerful when moving
along predictable paths. But in the fast-moving world of the 1990s, products
and technologies are changing much more swiftly than before. This favours
the American genius for improvisation rather than the Japanese juggernaut.
Take the Japanese system of consensus management, whereby everyone has to
agree to a decision before it is acted on. Mr Ed Zschau, president of IBM's
storage products division, says: 'That system works really well when you
have a long life cycle for products. But when you have a very short, fast
cycle, you have to give more responsibility to individuals.'
Above all, Japan's strength lay historically in two crucial disciplines:
quality of product, and efficiency in manufacturing. Now, the argument runs,
America has caught up. Mr Harvey Jones, head of Synopsys, a Californian
software company, says: 'The Japanese were a source of the idea that quality
is a measurement of value. We spent 20 years marvelling at that, and saying
that if we didn't adopt it we would be consumed by it. In the end, people
realised you either had to buy into the quality revolution or die.'
US companies seem to have chosen the former option. Mr John Young, lately
retired as head of Hewlett-Packard and an adviser on competitiveness to
President Clinton, says: 'I give US manufacturers pretty high marks since
the mid-1980s for getting to grips with their problems. If you took a tour
of factories today, you would find the ideas of total quality management and
process re-engineering have become deeply embedded and well executed in a
very broad range of companies.'
The US, it appears, has learnt Japan's secrets. To get back in the game,
Japan needs to learn the kind of creative skills traditionally associated
with the US, and Silicon Valley in particular. 'The Japanese have seen the
religion of creativity, just as we've seen the religion of total quality
management,' says Mr Jones. 'But the cultural factors inhibiting them are
much more powerful. Total quality management is a mechanical process. You
have to understand it, engineer it and instil it in your organisation, and
none of that is trivial. But it's not rocket science. Creative thinking is
much more deep-seated.'
If US industry seems convinced that the future is rosy, US economists are a
good deal less sure. Competitiveness, they say, is only a means to an end:
raising the population's standard of living. America may have improved its
performance in external markets, but the fact remains that real incomes have
been static for the past 20 years. The chief reason for that is poor
productivity growth, averaging less than 1 per cent a year over the same
period. There has been a big revival in manufacturing productivity in the
past few years. Productivity in the service sector, however, seems scarcely
to have grown, even if in absolute terms it remains higher than in Europe or
Japan.
Besides, manufactured goods account for only some 20 per cent of the US
economy. Only 40 per cent of those manufactures are traded internationally.
In other words, goods competing in world markets make up less than a tenth
of the economy.
There is also the question of how these gains in manufacturing productivity
have been achieved. Mr Fred Bergsten, head of the government-backed
Competitiveness Policy Council, says productivity growth in manufacturing
has been improving for six or seven years now. 'But a lot of that is through
down-sizing and lay-offs. That is not a satisfactory outcome for the
economy. It's essential, and I'm not knocking it, but it's not enough. You
also need economic growth if you're going to create jobs.'
Mr Stephen Roche, of the Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley, goes
further. US industry, he says, has adopted a 'slash and burn' mentality. 'I
believe we're getting overly fixated on cost-cutting as a means of boosting
short-term gains,' he says. 'The gratification for shareholders is swift,
but if you get hooked on cutting, you hollow out your ability to compete in
the long term. I worry that when the world recovers and the party is held,
we may not have enough people to party.'
The argument is hotly disputed by some industrialists. It assumes, they say,
that productivity improvement is a finite process. In fact, there has been a
revolution in US work practices - particularly among large companies - which
makes the scope for improvement practically limitless. Above all, they say,
the trick is to involve the entire workforce, from the worker on the shop
floor to the production director, in thinking up ways to improve
effectiveness.
Mr William Marx, head of manufacturing at the telecommunications giant AT&amp;T,
says: 'One of the real differentiators is whether you can get your employees
engaged. We've worked awfully hard on that at AT&amp;T, and it's a real source
of competitive advantage.'
On one point, industrialists and economists are united. International
competition means Japan - and thereafter emerging nations such as Korea,
Taiwan and above all China - but not Europe. Industry in Europe is
universally dismissed as idle, hidebound and trapped in an old-fashioned
system of social support. Those industrialists who follow European affairs
regard with astonishment such recent events as Air France's capitulation to
its unions or Volkswagen's move to part-time working.
On the other hand, they are careful to give Japan its due. Indeed, having
been convicted of complacency in the 1970s and early 1980s - and having been
badly scared as a result - they now seem almost superstitious in their
eagerness to praise their opponents. Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General
Electric, says: 'We are students of Japan here in GE. We think they're
marvellous, marvellous industrialists. We like their new product
development, we like their speed, we like their quality focus. I put them at
the pinnacle, and we're working every day to learn everything we can from
them.'
Mr James Cannavino, IBM's senior vice-president for strategy and
development, says: 'They're relentless. Relentless. If you tell them the
mountain is this high, and they have to run up it, they run up it. If you
say, 'I'm sorry, but it's 10 times the height', they don't say 'hey, that
wasn't the deal' - they run up that too.'
This attitude may prove not merely healthy but essential. In some areas, the
US advantage may prove temporary, based on nothing more fundamental than the
cyclical weakness of the Japanese economy and the strength of the yen. In
the auto industry, for instance, there is an uneasy awareness that the
long-term growth market is probably not the US or Europe, but the
Asia-Pacific region. 'If that turns out to be true,' says Mr Wayne Booker,
Ford's head of international operations, 'the Japanese are sitting in the
catbird seat.'
Autos apart, the US is being inexorably drawn into the world arena by the
growth of world trade. Mr Bergsten says: 'If you look at exports plus
imports in goods and services, that's now equivalent to 25 per cent of
America's gross national product. That's identical to Japan and the EC. In
the past 20 years that ratio has doubled for us, whereas for Europe and
Japan it hasn't changed. The US has joined the world, and now has to worry
much more about the international dimension of its economic performance.'
In any case, Mr Bergsten argues, competitiveness is not merely a matter of
the trade balance. 'You have to look at productivity, the national standard
of living, the fundamental stuff that makes up the domestic economy. That
doesn't look so good.'
Thus, the critics repeat, productivity growth for the whole economy is still
unsatisfactory. In addition, investment as a proportion of GNP is still very
low. So are savings. And - a recurrent theme among the doubters - the
average real wage in America is at least 10 per cent lower than it was 20
years ago. The picture is less bad if non-wage benefits are included. Even
so, total compensation over 20 years seems to have been broadly static.
Another vital component of competitiveness is human capital, or the quality
of education. The worry here is not the American universities, which have a
deservedly high reputation. 'We have this terrific higher education system,'
Mr Bergsten says. 'It's a big profit centre, a competitive part of America.
We export Dollars 6bn worth of education services a year. But people forget
that only one out of four Americans makes it through college' (that is,
completes a degree).
The real problem, he argues, comes in the schools. 'The statistical results
of the American primary and secondary school system are unimproved from 30
years ago, and may be worse. They are lagging more and more behind every
other country for which comparable data are compiled: not just industrial
countries, but Hungary, Korea and some developing countries.'
This raises another fundamental aspect of the competitiveness debate: how
far will the US have to compete with the third world by settling for
third-world living standards? Everyone you talk to in the US would reject
this as unacceptable. But part of the problem is the very technology which
the US has done so much to pioneer. In a world in which communications are
bringing the true global corporation ever nearer, the threat to the US may
come not from foreign competition, but from US companies moving their plants
to eastern Europe or their software research to India.
Mr Daniel Burton, president of the Council on Competitiveness (an
independent think-tank unrelated to the Competitiveness Policy Council),
says: 'The US can't run an economy on industries and services where you're
not competing with third-world economies on some level. For the first time,
a China or a Bangladesh can combine third-world wages with state-of-the-art
technology. It's not that hard. The stuff's around, an investor picks it up
and sticks a plant there. We have to compete with that.'
The effects of all this on the American psychology are not easy to gauge.
Again, it comes back to standard of living. The American tradition is based
on the expectation of rising wealth. Large parts of the population are now
faced with the reality of being poorer than their parents, or even their
grandparents. The price of industrial competitiveness may thus be the
lowering of expectations, not only for wages but for working hours and
conditions. In the US, the lesson is proving painful. Europe, for the most
part, has yet to confront it.
Mr Welch of GE puts the point bluntly: 'The world's changing. People in the
US and Europe aren't going to live the way they do 100 years from now unless
they do a lot of things differently. Who says that because we have 240m
people on this big piece of land we should have two cars and second homes,
while 800m people in India and 1bn in China should live the way they live?
We've only been wealthy in this country for 70 years. Who said we ought to
have all this? Is it ordained?'

FT  07 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Greenspan's lead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Both in its timing and substance, Friday's announcement that the Federal
Reserve has tightened US monetary policy was good news for the world
economy. The strength of the recovery and historically low US rates meant
some policy tightening was inevitable, although few expected the Fed to move
so soon. But by combining an unusual public statement of intent with a
modest quarter-point rise in short-term rates, Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve chairman, appears simultaneously to have satisfied both the
inflation-hawks and the White House, and boosted his already substantial
reputation in the process.
Foresight in action combined with clarity of explanation are the twin keys
to effective central banking. On both counts, Mr Greenspan's handling of the
US recession and recovery has so far been exemplary. His willingness to cut
rates aggressively as the scale of the US banks' debt difficulties became
apparent now means that they are in a strong position to support recovery,
unlike their Japanese counterparts. Raising short-term rates back towards
their cyclical norm should reassure investors that inflation will not now be
allowed to accelerate.
Whether the move will affect Europe's recovery will depend on how German and
French central bankers respond. The recent D-Mark depreciation is one
oft-cited reason why the Bundesbank remains reluctant to cut German rates
further, despite the stagnant economy and falling inflation. The combination
of a US recovery and higher interest rates could well mean a period of
appreciation for the US dollar.
Yet to postpone rate cuts in case the D-Mark or French franc were to weaken
further against the dollar would be to draw exactly the wrong conclusions
from the Fed's success. Mr Greenspan has certainly not allowed US monetary
policy to be derailed as he agonised over charts of almost certainly
distorted and backward-looking monetary aggregates, or worried about
short-term dollar weakness.
Instead, he has remained consistently focused on the underlying objective of
monetary policy: to secure sustained growth with low and stable inflation
and inflationary expectations.
If Mr Greenspan were the governor of the Bundesbank or the Bank of France,
he would currently be doing nothing. The interest rate cuts that both
economies still badly need would have been delivered some time ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again an atrocity, by crossing a new threshold of horror, has refocused
the world's flagging attention on Bosnia, and in particular on Sarajevo. The
Bosnian Serb militia has disclaimed responsibility, alleging that the
Moslem-led Bosnian government deliberately staged a massacre of its own
civilians to provoke outside military intervention against the Serbs. That
strains credulity, and does not explain how the mortar-bomb apparently came
to be fired from Serb-held territory.
The UN is investigating, but the overwhelming presumption must be that this
was a further escalation, whether deliberate or accidental, of the pressure
the Serbs have been applying relentlessly to the city since the war started
nearly two years ago. As such, it is a very direct provocation to the UN,
which is supposed to be protecting Sarajevo along with other 'safe havens',
and to Nato, which last August explicitly threatened air strikes 'in the
event that the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues'.
Lord Owen, the European Union mediator, has argued that the latest outrage
makes it imperative to bring the city under UN administration. The problem,
however, is not the city's administration but its defence. There can be no
justification for removing it from the administration of the internationally
recognised government, while leaving the surrounding area under the control
of the Serb militia, which has been pounding it to death.
The issue is not solely or even primarily humanitarian. Indeed, the tendency
to analyse the situation in the former Yugoslavia in purely humanitarian
terms has perhaps been the biggest mistake that western governments have
made throughout. Whereas in Kuwait and in the Falklands governments set
aside narrowly humanitarian considerations, realising the disastrous
consequences that would follow if aggression were allowed to succeed, in the
former Yugoslavia they have responded to aggression with verbal
condemnations and empty threats, while confining their action to a
humanitarian effort which is at best a palliative, and at worst only
prolongs the agony.
What is at stake is the credibility of the principles which were supposed to
form the basis of a lasting peace in Europe, following the end of the cold
war, and - perhaps even more serious - the credibility of the international
organisations in which the peoples of Europe had vested their hopes of peace
and security: Nato, EU, UN and the Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe.
That being so, the worst thing to do now would be nothing, even if it can be
plausibly argued that any given action (such as a punitive air strike
against Serb positions) will in itself do little to improve the situation,
and may in some respects make it worse. It is vital to restore some
credibility, at least to Nato and the UN - the two organisations most
concerned with military security - by demonstrating that their express
orders cannot be defied with impunity.
But clearly an action that achieves some strategic advantage would be
preferable, if one can be found. The one that suggests itself is the use of
force to reopen the airport at Tuzla, through which the main part of the
country still in government hands could be far more easily resupplied than
by road.
The UN has been trying to achieve this by diplomacy since the autumn, and
Nato at last month's summit explicitly linked its threat of air strikes to
the opening of the airport, as well as relief of the UN garrison at
Srebrenica. General Sir Michael Rose, the new UN commander in Bosnia, showed
last week that he is prepared to risk confrontation with Serb forces if
necessary. He should now be told to reopen Tuzla airport without further
delay, and authorised to call on 'close air support' from Nato as soon as
anyone tries to stop him.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Leading Article: EBRD's priorities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last four years have demonstrated that establishing liberal capitalism
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will be a task with many
interruptions. The fission of the Soviet empire has made the policy
environment much more complex. It has exposed a sharp economic downturn, and
a kaleidoscopic diversity of regional structures.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up in 1991 to
assist post-communist transformation. But on this unfamiliar terrain, it has
seemed too cumbersome to play an effective role. Mr Jacques de Larosiere,
who took over last autumn following the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali,
has recognised the bank's organisational shortcomings, and taken steps to
remedy them.
The latest move to increase EBRD staff in its offices outside London,
following the operational streamlining announced in November, goes in the
right direction. Deploying in the field sufficient numbers of high-grade
employees with a talent for channelling the EBRD's funds and expertise
towards potential customers is an obvious priority.
Hiring more young deal-makers with on-the-ground knowledge should allow the
EBRD to compete more successfully with western merchant banks offering
advice and loans to the private sector in former communist countries. At the
very least, the EBRD's fees can be expected to be less than those of Wall
Street and City rivals. More generally, decentralisation should allow the
bank to gear its activities more closely to countries' varying needs.
At the helm of a bank with 56 public sector shareholders, Mr de Larosiere
must serve many masters. He cannot avoid dashing some expectations. The
EBRD's purpose is neither philosophical nor charitable. It must offer its
shareholders a return on its Ecu10bn of subscribed capital. The bank was
widely criticised last year for slow disbursement of funds, and has since
accelerated distribution of loans and equity. Yet the EBRD's recent request
for compensation over its payment of Dollars 30m for a 20 per cent stake in
the Czech national airline underlines how judgments can come unstuck. The
EBRD's start-up activities may lead to a greater degree of write-offs than
revealed hitherto. Up to now, Mr de Larosiere's approach has shown the right
mix of flair and commonsense. To assure the bank's future, he will also
need, during the next few years, to show results.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover: symptom of a questionable
trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J. HAMILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, BMW's takeover of Rover has again raised the question of foreign
acquisitions of UK companies. Since 1988, foreign companies have made a
total of 986 acquisitions in the UK valued at about Pounds 50bn. Such
acquisitions account for almost half of the total value of all cross-border
acquisitions in the European Union in recent years. The list of British
companies externally acquired includes Beecham, Midland Bank, Rowntree,
Jaguar, STS, Pearl Group, Yorkshire Bank, Metal Box Packaging and RTZ
Chemicals. Equally important, a large number of small and medium-sized
British companies has been externally acquired.
While 'green-field' foreign direct investment in the UK has generally been
welcomed for its positive effects on the British economy, the economic
impact of inward acquisitions is less clear. A recent study by SIBU examined
post-acquisition change in a sample of 73 British companies externally
acquired since 1985. The study highlighted a mix of both positive and
negative effects of external acquisitions. Positive effects included
increased capital and R&amp;D expenditure post-acquisition, the transfer of
innovative management practices and increased exports. The most significant
negative effects included substantial employment losses as a result of
post-acquisition rationalisation and integration, and the transfer of
decision-making out of the UK.
There were significant variations in the impact of acquisition by
nationality of acquirer. Generally, UK acquisitions by non-EU companies have
had a more favourable (less negative) effect than acquisitions by EU-based
firms. These differences were related to the initial motivations behind the
acquisition.
For non-EU based companies, UK acquisitions have acted as an important
channel for establishing market share in the single market. Such
acquisitions driven by product/market expansion have positive effects if the
UK operation is given an important role to play in the overall
global/regional strategy of the new parent company. This is less likely in
the case of UK acquisitions by EU-based companies which are more
cost-efficiency driven. Such deals will be accompanied by post-acquisition
rationalisation and big job losses.
The UK government has adopted a laisser-faire approach to foreign takeovers
of British companies. Given the scale of the phenomenon and evidence of
negative impact, this liberal approach should now be questioned.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Airline aid proposal realistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R. COLEGATE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Mostly wise on open skies' (February 2), you
criticise the recommendation of the committee of wise men that one last
round of state aid should be permitted in the context of restructuring plans
that promise to make state-owned airlines viable within a strictly limited
time.
Whether or not this recommendation is wise or fair, it is surely realistic.
The situation is in many ways analogous to the reconstruction of a public
company in administration. BA could not have been privatised had the British
government not guaranteed its finances in 1982.
The problem now is that privatisation cannot be made a condition for
approving a final injection of state aid to an ailing flag carrier. Nothing
in the Treaty of Rome, which here faithfully reflects the thinking of the
1950s, would support an attempt by the Commission to issue guidelines
limiting the approval of state aid in this way. One must hope that the
market place will produce the desired result, as is already happening in
Portugal and may yet happen in France.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Human rights a precondition of trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL KEARNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You say in 'China and the Gatt' (January 31) that the west cannot
ignore gross violations of human rights in its relations with China, but
that trade relations should focus only on the policies that affect trade.
China's human rights abuses do affect trade.
The denial of freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively
distorts the labour market. The use of children and millions of prisoners in
export industries constitutes unfair competition which can hardly be
portrayed as a 'comparative advantage'.
Apologists for China, particularly those European and US investors who have
largely abandoned production in their own countries and are now fearful of
import restrictions, argue that the best way to advance social change is
through permitting foreign investors in the country to make even bigger
profits. Some hope] US pressure over most-favoured-nation status proves the
contrary. For the first time ever, the Chinese have indicated their
willingness to discuss human rights. More, not less, pressure is needed. Was
it not such pressure that restored democracy in central and eastern Europe?
The continuing arrests of worker activists for 'counter-revolutionary
activities' and the forcible internment of some in psychiatric institutions
is an affront to humanity. China's application to join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade should be denied until it accepts international
standards on human and worker rights. Trade with China should be strictly
limited until it eliminates its inhuman abuse of its workforce.
Why must we kow-tow to multinationals making expensive toys and training
shoes, in abysmal conditions often using workers as young as the children
for which these products are intended in the west? World trade relations
should focus on the social dimension. If they move in that direction, then
China's economic policies will almost certainly become more market-oriented.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Property: In search of the ultimate des-res - A look at the
revival of interest and sales in the top tier of the UK property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 15th-century castle, set among the wooded countryside north of Hereford,
near the Welsh border, is proving a bellwether of sentiment among Britain's
wealthiest property buyers.
Built in 1427 by Sir Rowland Lenthall, who was knighted for gallantry at the
battle of Agincourt, the Hampton Court estate boasts 1,000 acres of land,
including a Grade I listed castle - with 30 bedrooms, a ballroom, private
chapel and banqueting hall - plus a pheasant shoot, deer stalking, trout
fishing, a farm house and seven workers' cottages.
Even allowing for the hyperbole of the property world, the estate inspires
superlatives. It is 'the pinnacle of the property ladder, the epitome of the
country house', according to its agent, Mr Tony Morris-Eyton, of Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley.
For the past three years, the house has been a poignant reminder of the
collapse in demand for grand country mansions. In 1987, James Folkes,
director of a Birmingham engineering company, and his wife Xenia bought it
for Pounds 1.65m. Three years later, having decided, according to their
agent, to move closer to his business, they put it on the market for Pounds
5m. There was no buyer.
But when they put it back on the market just before Christmas, with the
price slashed to Pounds 2m, the response was overwhelming: more than 60
potential purchasers have arranged to view the property in the past six
weeks.
The flurry of interest has yet to be translated into a sale. But it adds to
a widespread impression that the revival of the British economy, the
buoyancy of the UK stock market and lower interest rates are restoring
confidence in the top tier of the property market.
Agents report a marked upturn in demand for expensive properties - although
usually with the caveat that they have to be the ultimate des-res, unspoilt
and free of noise pollution. 'Since Christmas, we have had a huge surge in
the number of potential buyers,' says Mr Alexander Hunt from the London
office of estate agents Strutt &amp; Parker.
The first signs of revival were evident in 1993, when at least 10 estates
worth more than Pounds 1.75m each were sold, more than double the number
sold in 1992. Deals included the purchase for Pounds 12m of the 20,000-acre
Tulchan estate in Morayshire, Scotland, by Mr Leon Litchfield, owner of a
Midlands-based plastics business; the sale of the Pounds 11m Druids Lodge
estate in Wiltshire, and the Pounds 4.25m Fosbury Manor estate, also in
Wiltshire, to members of the Guinness family; and the purchase of the
Pickenham Hall estate in Norfolk, which includes most of the village of
South Pickenham, for Pounds 8m by a German businessman.
The pace now appears to be quickening. Already this year the Corby Castle
estate in Cumbria, which had been in the Howard family for nearly 400 years,
has been sold for Pounds 2m to an Irish-based businessman. A sale has also
been agreed on the 1,000-acre Braishfield Manor estate in Hampshire, for
which the owners were asking between Pounds 3.25m and Pounds 4.25m.
Although reliable figures are not available, demand for such properties
still seems a long way short of the heady levels of the late 1980s. Then,
sales were fuelled by rising incomes, easy access to loan finance and the
new-found wealth of a number of businessmen whose companies had been floated
on the stock market.
Estate agents report a change in buyers' priorities since then. More
consideration is being given to the practicalities - and expense - of
running a large country estate. Properties in better condition or with
relatively low maintenance and staffing costs are more likely to be sold. 'A
lot of people bought very big, unmanageable houses for the status at the end
of the 1980s. Now there is a bit of resistance to very big houses that are
expensive to maintain,' says Mr John Husband of Humberts estate agents.
Underpinning the current activity at the highest reaches of the property
market, however, is a continuing supply of wealthy people still attracted by
the prestige and sporting pleasures associated with owning a country estate.
A further attraction is the tax advantages of investing in farmland. Capital
gains from the sale of a business can be rolled over into buying an estate
or farm. Since 1992, investment in land farmed by the owner for at least two
years can be passed on free of inheritance tax. For overseas buyers,
particularly from continental Europe, advantageous exchange rates and the
UK's perceived economic and political stability are additional incentives.
Indeed, the main problem for this end of the property market appears to be
less a lack of buyers than a lack of sellers. The steep fall in property
values has largely confined the ranks of would-be sellers to those forced to
sell because of debt, death or divorce. Most estate agents estimate that, on
average, prices of country estates have fallen about 40 per cent in the
early 1990s.
Death is becoming a less frequent cause of property sales, as a result of
the change in inheritance tax rules in 1992. Financial difficulties, in
contrast, have become an increasingly common reason for sales. Losses
incurred by some Lloyd's Names, individuals whose assets support the
insurance market, have, together with crippling estate repair bills and
declining farm incomes, influenced the top end of the market. But the effect
of setbacks at Lloyd's may be exaggerated. 'As a firm we have been staggered
by how few Lloyd's losses have been converted into (house) sales,' says Mr
Hunt of Strutt &amp; Parker.
Compared with other residential properties, the market for country estates
is more prone to sharp fluctuations. And there has been a number of
high-profile property victims. In 1992, for instance, Brympton d'Evercy, a
Tudor mansion in Somerset, was sold for just Pounds 850,000; and Pitchford
Hall, an Elizabethan house near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, went for Pounds 1m.
These low prices underlined the pressures on Britain's landowning families.
The indications are, however, that if the recovery in the top end of the
housing market is sustained, a number of prestige properties would come on
to the market and go some way towards meeting demand. The Historic Houses
Association, an association of country house owners, says that many
families, who have held estates for centuries, are battling to keep
possession of their properties. 'A great many people have made all the
sacrifices they can,' says Mr Terence Empson, HHA director-general.
The association fears that the new buyers will displace what the late Lord
Ridley, the former environment secretary, described as the anciens pauvres
and fail to maintain the properties as family homes. 'It never was the case
that the nouveaux riches were rushing to buy properties as family homes,'
says Mr Empson.
In the past, many an entrepreneur has bought an estate with the intention
of, for instance, turning the house into a hotel and the grounds into a golf
course - as did Asil Nadir, the disgraced businessman, with Burley House, a
Palladian mansion in Leicestershire, bought for Pounds 7m in 1990. But some
such schemes were abandoned when recession began to take hold, and houses
and grounds have been neglected. Of the 460 family seats sold over the past
20 years, at least 105 have already been resold, and further broken up in
the process, according to the association.
Nevertheless, the recent improvement in demand for estates suggests that
individuals are returning to the market in significant numbers. It may be
years before the values of large country houses return to the heights of the
late 1980s, but it seems that the life of a pheasant-shooting country squire
is beginning to attract the property buyer once again.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ignore county councils' cries of
self-interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DENNIS BENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We now have the bizarre spectacle of county councils mounting at public
expense a massive last-ditch campaign to influence the local government
review.
As someone who probably fits the media cliche 'well known in local business
circles', I am intrigued by any claim that there is widespread support for
the retention of County Hall here in Lancashire. Most people view it as a
tier too many, an unnecessary and extremely expensive bureaucracy. Even more
importantly, it is inevitably remote from the various local communities, be
they business or private sector.
If our county halls really believe their own propaganda, perhaps they would
like to consider a referendum. My guess is that a vast majority of
Lancastrians would demand devolution of power to a number of cost-conscious
and accountable unitary authorities.
Here in Chorley our council sets an excellent example in good housekeeping
and accessibility to the people. Sadly, many of the major services that
affect everyone are outside its remit and are an ongoing frustration to one
and all.
Oh that it were otherwise - and so says many a frustrated Lancastrian. If
the government really believes in cost-effective local accountability, it
should ignore the cries of self-interest echoing along vast county hall
corridors.
Dennis Benson.

FT  07 FEB 94 / A Clinton Fed might hesitate: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve acted responsibly on Friday. This was about the last
moment it could have begun tightening without jeopardising its credibility
on inflation. Its decision was justified even if share prices plunge further
this week. Equity markets were frothy partly because the Fed had delayed an
inevitable tightening move for so long. Had it waited until March or April,
equities would probably have climbed higher, and any correction would have
been more violent.
Yet while congratulating the Fed, we should remember that Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan. In a
capital run by Democrats, the Fed is one of the last bastions of Republican
power: all of Mr Greenspan's fellow governors are either Reagan or Bush
appointees. The regional presidents who control a minority of votes on the
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee have a more diverse political
background, but as they are selected by local business interests, they tend
to be conservatives.
It is largely because the Fed - still the anchor of the world's monetary
system - has enjoyed strong leadership for so long that Democrats can now
blithely dismiss fears of higher inflation. Indeed, had Mr Greenspan not
sought to reduce the 5 per cent inflation rate he inherited from Paul
Volcker in the late 1980s, the US would probably not today be within
striking distance of genuine price stability - meaning inflation so low that
it can be ignored for all practical purposes. Whether the US succeeds in
permanently kicking the inflation habit now depends on Bill Clinton.
Last month the White House signalled that Mr George Perry, an economist at
the Brookings Institution, was likely to succeed Mr Wayne Angell, an
'inflation hawk' whose term as a Fed governor has just expired. But Mr Perry
has still not been formally nominated because lawyers are investigating a
possible conflict of interest - Mr Perry's wife manages several large
investment funds. Following the surprise resignation last week of Mr David
Mullins, Mr Greenspan's able deputy, Mr Clinton must now fill a second
vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board.
These appointments are important. They could significantly alter the balance
of power within the Fed. But they are nothing like as important as a
question that, so far, has received surprisingly little attention: who will
replace Mr Greenspan?
Fed chairmen serve four-year terms (concurrently with their 14-year
governorships). Mr Greenspan's second four-year term expires in March 1996.
He will then be 70 and would be unlikely to seek a third term. In any case,
Mr Clinton will want to put his stamp on the Fed by appointing a Democrat to
the top job. In theory Mr Clinton need not worry yet about replacing Mr
Greenspan, but as he fills the two slots already open, it would be natural
to groom somebody for the chairmanship. Indeed, the White House may regard
Mr Perry as a suitable successor, not just to Mr Mullins but to Mr
Greenspan.
Messrs Angell and Mullins are departing. Mr Greenspan will go in two years.
It would not be surprising if Mr Larry Lindsey, a conservative Bush
appointee, went soon. This means that an era of stability, during which the
Fed has been run by a team of committed inflation fighters, could be ending.
Within a couple of years Clinton appointees will probably dominate the
central bank. Regional presidents may not put up much fight because
congressional committees are already threatening to clip their wings, either
by making them White House appointees or by cancelling their right to vote
on interest rate policy.
On Friday, far from bashing the Fed, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary,
emphasised the importance of its remaining independent. Neither he nor Mr
Clinton's other senior economic advisers would regard themselves as 'soft'
on inflation. So as they flip through CVs, can we relax confident in the
knowledge that a Clinton Fed would act responsibly? Regrettably, I think
not.
The problem is not that Mr Clinton will appoint lunatics or people obviously
incompetent, but that the type of person he favours will be just a shade
more complacent about inflation than the Greenspan team. And even a little
complacency can lead to serious financial instability  - and eventually a
wrenching recession. Think of Britain's problems in the late 1980s or those
of the Fed in the 1970s under Arthur Burns and G. William Miller.
Mr Perry, for example, is a respected economist. But his credentials as an
inflation fighter may not wholly satisfy financial markets. In a recent
article Mr Perry agreed with the old adage that a central bank must take
away the punch bowl just as the party gets lively. But not, he quipped,
'just when the guests are arriving'. This notion that the recovery has not
really got going, even though national income has been growing for nearly
three years, is characteristic of many Democratic-leaning economists.
I suspect most Clinton administration officials believe inflation of 5 per
cent, or preferably a bit less, is perfectly acceptable. At a Jackson Hole
monetary conference in 1992, Mr Larry Summers, now undersecretary at the
Treasury and a possible future candidate for the Fed chairmanship, argued
that 'austerity encounters diminishing returns'. He implied that Mr
Greenspan's avowed goal of stable prices made little sense, because the cost
of achieving zero inflation in terms of lost jobs and output exceeded the
benefits - which were highly dubious. We can assume this will be the
attitude of the next Fed chairman, whomever he or she may be.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Quest for a benefactor - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the most distressing consequence of the Arts Council's debacle over
the funding of the London orchestras was not the waste of the orchestras'
time and money, but the cloud that the exercise cast over their quest for
sponsorship for the 1994-95 season. With the Council apparently intent on
dropping two internationally acclaimed bands from its client list, few
potential business supporters were willing to show an interest.
The LPO, the RPO and the Philharmonia, which, in the event were all
reprieved and given roughly the previous year's subsidy, are now battling
hard to make up for lost time, but it would be surprising if sponsorship
revenue next season matches 1993-94.
Traditionally, the orchestras enjoyed sponsorship income which often
exceeded 10 per cent of revenue and, in some cases, outpaced Arts Council
subsidy. But London is over-supplied with symphony concerts and sponsors are
aware of falling audiences. They are looking for something 'fresh' and
'original' from classical music.
So the orchestras are trying to devise packages for sponsors - 'seasons',
'festivals', or links which give the sponsor more prominence. Typical is
BMW's backing for the English Concert Orchestra to play a 'mystery piece' at
each concert. The regular attender who correctly guesses the most composers
and their works during the season receives a substantial prize. Last Monday
night conductor Raymond Leppard was talking about the competition from the
rostrum, driving the BMW name home.
Fortunately there is one area where orchestras offer sponsors a service not
equalled by theatre or dance companies - international touring. Virtually
every major overseas orchestral tour is now sponsored. As well as a
guaranteed fee, the orchestra meets a new audience; flys the flag; and
sponsors can entertain foreign contacts and wrap the prestige of an
acclaimed British orchestra around their products.
This week in Vienna the LSO signed its largest ever sponsorship deal, with
Takeda, the leading drugs and chemicals company in Japan. Worth in excess of
Pounds 500,000, it is taking the LSO around Austria and Germany; to the
Salzburg Festival in August; and to the US and Japan in 1995. This is the
third worldwide sponsorship between the LSO and Takeda.
The key to the relationship is Hiroaki Yamataka, who heads the Japanese wing
of Kleinwort Benson in London and is an international vice-president of the
LSO. He arranged the initial contact in 1988, and is proof of how important
it is for leading arts organisations to appoint influential members to their
boards.
Katsura Morita, chairman of Takeda, says that Japanese companies are keeping
faith with the arts companies they sponsor during the Japanese recession.
This is one of the advantages of working in a culture where losing face is a
grievous failing.
Takeda's support for the LSO stems from its belief that music can make the
mind healthy. It is also alive to the advantage of using the LSO to
accompany it into new overseas markets.
*****
Thanks to sponsorship, art has a new prize to set against the Turner. The
criticism that the Turner Prize is only awarded to 'cutting edge' artists,
practitioners in abstract sculpture or conceptual art rather than to
painters, has taken substantial shape in the form of the Jerwood Painting
Prize. It is worth Pounds 30,000, making it the most valuable art award in
the country. The inclusion of the unfashionable word 'painting' in the title
confirms that it will go to an artist who is still working in a figurative
way.
The funding comes from the Jerwood Foundation, set up by the late John
Jerwood who made his money from the Japanese pearl industry. Five British
artists will be shortlisted on the basis of their recent work, and their
paintings will be on show at the Royal Scottish Academy during the Edinburgh
Festival and at the Royal Academy in London in September. The winner will be
announced then. A painting by the winner will be bought and loaned to a
public museum or gallery in the UK.
The Jerwood Foundation's traditional concerns were limited to youth and
music, but it has widened its interests and gives more than Pounds 500,000 a
year to the arts. Among its beneficiaries are the National Youth Chamber
Orchestra, the National Art Collections Fund Awards, and the Bush Theatre in
London.
*****
BT has re-asserted its position as the UK's leading corporate sponsor of the
arts. It has donated Pounds 500,000, over three years, to the Association of
British Orchestras, which will mastermind the commissioning and the
performance of a new orchestral work.
James MacMillan will compose the first piece which will be successively
performed by 12 leading orchestras. The premiere will be at the Barbican on
September 21 and feature the LSO.
The next generation will be helped by a Pounds 60,000 BT sponsorship for
London's young musicians. The money will enable gifted young people to study
at the Centre for Young Musicians at Morley College. This does not affect
the Pounds 60,000 a year that London Electricity provides for the London
Symphony Schools Orchestra, produced by the Centre.
*****
Panasonic Europe is to continue as exclusive sponsor of the European
Community Baroque Orchestra, supporting young musicians with Pounds 335,000
over the next three years.
*****
Thorn EMI has given Pounds 30,000 towards a recording studio at the Royal
Academy of Music. It will be used in the Academy's full-time commercial
music course.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Hackney learns from Tudor heritage - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems far from rolling rural England. But there is an ancient Kentish
ragstone church tower and a large and shady churchyard sprouting crocuses.
You can arrive by train and be almost the only person on the platform. It is
hard to believe that you are in the heart of that part of East London that
is vibrant and decaying, the London Borough of Hackney.
Last week an event occured that further confounded the accepted view of this
suffering inner city borough - the staid old National Trust opened an
historic house there.
Sutton House started its life in 1535 as a country house on the eastern edge
of the City of London for Ralph Sadleir, courtier, judge and politician. He
was a great survivor who worked for Thomas Cromwell and ended up as one of
Mary, Queen of Scots' judges.
Sutton House is also a great survivor. It has been a school, men's club and
office, and it endured the worst of the London Blitz. In 1936 it was the
subject of a concerned letter to The Times from George Lansbury, Labour
member of parliament for Poplar, and Lord Esher and Lord Crawford and
Balcarres.
They organised a public appeal to save Sutton House and it took the National
Trust's intervention, with a legacy given in memory of two men killed in the
first world war, to finally secure the Tudor building for the nation.
Somehow the National Trust never quite knew what to do with Sutton House.
It wasn't in their normal country bailiwick and it was tenanted and
administered from the remote headquarters in Hughenden manor in
Buckinghamshire.
When I first saw the house in the late 1980s it was empty, boarded up and
vandalised. There was then a scheme to split it up into flats and sell them.
It was the residents of Hackney, led by one or two particularly fervent
locals, who changed the Trust's mind and set in train a determined effort to
save the house and return it to the community.
Today Hackney has one of the most intriguing and best preserved Tudor
houses, with later additions, to be seen in London.
What is especially inspiring is the way the Trust and the community have
decided to use it.
When I was there last week the big hall, which dates back to the 1900s and
was designed by the Arts and Crafts architect Lionel Crane, was full of
children joining in a production of Falstaff with singers from the English
National Opera.
Many Musical events and educational activities are planned to ensure that
the house is seen as a teaching resource.
It is a brilliant place to learn about architecture. First of all, approach
it from the fine Georgian church and the elegant street of Georgian houses,
Sutton Place. Then observe the house, which is almost overwhelmed by the
giant concrete sixties Community School across the road.
The house is an 'H' shaped plan and was built of brick in the first half of
the sixteenth century. One wing was rendered and has new fenestration from
the 18th or early 19th century.
Inside the house is one of the best linenfold panelled rooms in London. The
Great Chamber on the first floor retains the atmosphere of a Tudor room that
showed off the wealth of the owner.
There are good Georgian and Victorian interiors and an exhibition room where
the full and complex history of the house is shown. I was extremely
impressed by the way the architect Richard Griffiths had not just carried
out a meticulous restoration but had added some additions in a completely
contemporary way.
The new restaurant occupies a modern conservatory addition built of bronze,
ash wood and glass.
It demonstrates that it is perfectly possible to mix the old and the new if
they are of matching quality in design and materials.
Sutton House has an appropriate liveliness about it - but this is not at the
expense of the historic qualities of the architecture.
School children study courses that bring history alive and there is an
architectural course, 'Bricks and Building', that would be suitable for
adult beginners.
The whole Sutton House Community Scheme has cost Pounds 2m and half of this
sum has come from the National Trust. Many businesses, livery companies, and
private donors have helped to fund the restoration. It is a brilliant cause
 -the model rejuvenation of Sutton House has brought history and
architecture alive in Hackney in a way that has clearly inspired affection
and tapped a local enthusiasm in a stirring and remarkable way.
Sutton House can be hired for events and functions and the historic rooms
are open on Wednesdays, Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays from 11.30am to
5.30pm. Telephone for concert bookings and information, 081-986 0221.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Un ballo' falls flat - Andrew Clark reviews the first
production to bear Peter Jonas's imprint at the Bavarian State Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Jonas has had the misfortune to start his new job in Munich with an
artistic flop. Un ballo in maschera, the first production at the Bavarian
State Opera to bear his imprint as intendant, is leadenly conducted and
dramatically inert. Its first-night woes were compounded when Dennis O'Neill
developed a throat infection, leaving Jonas to find a substitute tenor at 24
hours' notice. But that alone cannot explain the production's pedestrian
impact.
Since his arrival in Munich last autumn, the former ENO general director has
adopted a high media profile, preaching renewal, accessibility, a more
contemporary style. Backstage and front-of-house, the Jonas charm has worked
wonders, just as it did in London. But Jonas himself admitted that the real
test would come at curtain-up.
Ballo was a curious way to begin. Verdi has never been central to Munich's
repertory, and the success of his operas there has usually depended on a
star conductor who knows the style. Ballo was in the hands of Jonas's music
director, Peter Schneider, who gave the kind of heavy, plodding account one
expects in middle-ranking German theatres.
The performance lacked inner tension, textural transparence, a sense of
melodic shape. There were too many lapses between stage and pit. Only in the
Renato-Amelia confrontation at the start of Act three, with its brassy
outbursts and gentle instrumental solos, did Verdi's expressive
accompaniment breathe naturally.
The staging was entrusted to Tom Cairns, one of several British-based
artists invited by Jonas to work in Munich. On this evidence, Cairns should
stick to designing and leave producing to someone else. His decor - a
different setting for each scene - mixed surrealist and naturalistic imagery
in a variety of distinctive shapes and colours. Ulrica's hut was a
transparent white box on a promontory overlooking the ocean. The midnight
tryst took place under a giant suspended boulder.
Renato's library was a wedge of space boasting a pair of deer-antlers. There
were touches of rococo in the opening and closing scenes. Costumes were
historical and handsome.
The visual symbols could have been subtler and the scene changes shorter,
but Cairns at least created space for human drama. Sadly, this was where the
production degenerated into dullest routine. Cairns made no identifiable
impact on the principals, while the chorus movements directed by his
co-producer, Aletta Collins, would have been more at home in Gilbert and
Sullivan.
None of the cast could flourish in such circumstances, but Julia Varady did
her best. This was her debut performance as Amelia, sung from the heart like
all her other Verdi heroines, and acted with the vulnerable intensity that
distinguishes a noble artist. Wolfgang Brendel's Renato was bland and
disengaged. As the last-minute substitute, Kristian Johannsson sounded more
of a Turiddu or Calaf than a Verdi stylist. Nina Terentieva was the imposing
fortune-teller, Julie Kaufmann a sprightly Oscar. The comprimarios were
good.
Ballo may have dented Jonas's credibility, but with the Sawallisch legacy
still strong, Munich's loyalty was not to be won on a single production.
Operatic traditions and expectations there are a world apart from ENO, and
it is fitting that Jonas, the outsider, should work for change gradually. He
must find a more inspiring house conductor than Schneider. He also needs to
notch up a popular success.
Next month's new Giulio Cesare, with Richard Jones, Ivor Bolton and Ann
Murray, would do nicely.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Government Inspector' moved to Dublin - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nikolai Gogol (1809-52) wrote The Government Inspector in 1834 as a satire
on corrupt and craven bureaucrats in Czarist Russia. Now at the Tricycle
Theatre, the Dublin-Belfast theatre company Dubbeljoint has transplanted a
new version of the play to the peaty environs of county Ulster late last
century. At best it is a red-blooded bucolic show; but at worst, the
Inspector palls.
Gogol's classic of mistaken identity is a gift for situation comedy, ready
to be filled out by Marie Jones' rejigged version; and 19th-century Ireland
is a fine place for this drama of ossified class and parochial values. But
what emerges on stage is more knockabout than thinkabout.
A small provincial town, guilty as sin over a local beef swindle, has been
tipped off about an Inspector from the capital. The provincials paddling in
the peat bogs decide that a new stranger in town must be their man: 'He's
incognito' - 'No he's not, he's in the hotel.' The bemused stranger catches
on and milks a situation where the burghers feel obliged to laugh at his
jokes and ply him with bribes of sex and money. This faux-Inspector's
servant is convinced that Swift's Modest Proposal has been written into the
local bye-laws and that he is living amongst cannibals. Any mention of beef
sends him raving.
The harsh Irish accents make Gogol's jokes sound starkly aggressive instead
of lightly cynical. At the moment, everything is overdone; the squeamish
provincialism James Joyce found even in Dublin is flogged to death. The
actors try too hard, shout too much, and need to tone down.
But there are some delights: Dan Gordon's playing of the faux-Inspector, and
Eileen Pollock's (the Mayor's wife) sex-crazed delight at his arrival in her
house; Mark Lambert as the troubled Mayor is a chaotic presence, oscillating
between civic propriety and old-fashioned grovelling. Next time the
Inspector should be a Brussels functionary or GATT investigator. Pam
Brighton directs.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Monday Interview: Kawamoto faces reality with a smile -
Honda's chief gives Michiyo Nakamoto his reactions to Rover's deal with BMW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW brings a broad smile to the wrinkled face of Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto,
president of Honda. 'Of course we were surprised,' he chuckles. 'I thought,
so that is the way it is going to be after all.'
It was the end of the week in which BMW made its audacious move to buy 80
per cent of Rover Group, the British car manufacturer in which Honda has a
20 per cent stake. Yet Mr Kawamoto appeared able to talk with equanimity
about the German competitor which, to many in Tokyo, has impudently intruded
upon a 15-year-old relationship that was moving along quite happily without
it.
In a comfortable lounge overlooking the fashionable Aoyama district where
the company's Tokyo headquarters is located, the genial Mr Kawamoto hardly
appears angry and resentful as he was sometimes portrayed in the aftermath
of the announcement.
It emerges that the lengthy relationship between Honda and Rover did little
to bridge the gulf in business culture between the Japanese group and
Rover's British owners.
Honda's technology, production and management methods are woven into the way
Rover factories work. But on larger issues of corporate governance - the
obligations a company owes to workers and communities as well as
shareholders and customers - BAe's handling of the Rover sale is apparently
inexplicable for Honda.
Mr Kawamoto, in his first interview since the sale, says: 'We made a
proposal based on our principle and if that was not going to be accepted
then there was nothing we could do about it.'
Honda had not wanted to take over the entire company even though it had the
option to do so. 'Mr (George) Simpson (the Rover chairman) came on January
28 and said they were making this decision and was that all right with us.
We had the choice at the time to buy the whole company.'
But doing so would have gone against a Honda principle: a car manufacturing
enterprise plays such an influential role in the country in which it is
based that ultimately it should be controlled by the people of that nation.
'Car manufacturing has a very big social responsibility, in terms of
employment and resources, not just towards the current generation but
towards future generations as well. It is not possible to manage a car
manufacturer without taking that into consideration. That is our belief.'
Mr Kawamoto is not suggesting that foreign ownership leads to a lack of
responsibility. But Rover's case is special. 'Rover was the last original UK
car company. I think it is acceptable to take a 100 per cent stake in a
company if there are a lot of other car companies and if it is not the last
one to be controlled by the people of that country and if doing so does not
have such a crucial impact on the country's car industry.'
"Because Rover was the last, and the only, car company that is British, we
judged that it should be left British. That is not out of sympathy. We think
it is too simple to judge everything in terms of value for shareholders and
customers alone.'
The difference in Honda and BAe's priorities shocked the executives
cloistered at Aoyama. 'Rover's capital was sold, 100 per cent, all at once,
to a foreigner and I was surprised at the wide gap in our ways of thinking.'
'BAe never discussed with us how Rover's business could be improved. BAe
never approached us about that. Instead, we were suddenly told that BMW was
interested and what did we think. But I don't think manufacturing, which is
a process involving the combined efforts of an enormous number of people, is
so simple that the fate of a company can be decided in two or three months.
That is our way of thinking.'
Mr Kawamoto acknowledges that 'there is no doubt that this is one side of
modern business. Honda's top management, and we have had many discussions
about the turn of events, are realists.'
This realism characterises Mr Kawamoto's approach to Honda's European
strategy as well as the company's relationship with Rover and its German
parent. 'There are so many possibilities, aren't there? So until we hear
what BMW has to say we cannot make any decisions. However, even up to now we
have respected Rover as an independent company and our relationship was one
of two independent companies.'
His realism is combined with a stoicism that does not allow any moping over
what has happened. Asked whether he is concerned about Honda technology at
Rover passing into BMW's, the smile disappears from Mr Kawamoto's face. 'The
reality is that what technology is at Rover will go to BMW and that is the
reality. That is the truth, whether we like it or not. It is the truth and
we accept it as such.'
Honda has already gained much from its efforts to remake Rover. 'Rover has
become a much better company in the past 15 years and as a result we have
been able to receive cars manufactured by Rover which are purely European
and sell them in areas of Europe where the cars had to be made in Europe.'
Mr Kawamoto stresses that Honda is open to many possibilities for the
trilateral relationship, although would pull out if Rover lost its British
status as a result of BMW control.
'The only precondition is that we will stick to our principles and other
than that everything depends on whether it makes good business sense.
Rover's significance (to Honda) as a British company will be lost, but I do
not think it is easy for a business relationship that has been built up over
15 years to change tomorrow.'
Although by all measures, Mr Kawamoto has recovered from any initial shock
and resentment he may have felt and he is ready to make the best of the
situation, a nagging question remains. 'The British view that it is not
necessary to be concerned about the nationality of capital . . . what I
don't understand about this is, if you take the case of Japan, industry is
the only way to survive, but I wonder how the British people expect to make
a living in the future. The money game is fine and there must be a business
logic to it all but how do people expect to make a living in future, I must
study this some more. I would like to know.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / People: Canadian dark horse for OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Don who? The news that Canada's Don Johnston has emerged as the dark horse
in the four-way race to fill the secretary-general's post at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has caught many
non-Canadians by surprise, writes Bernard Simon.
Johnston is little known beyond Parliament Hill in Ottawa, or the legal
fraternity in Montreal, his home town. But he is undoubtedly both a serious
and a strong contender for the OECD job against Lord Lawson, the former UK
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lorenz Schomerus, a former chairman of the OECD
trade committee, and the present incumbent, France's Jean-Claude Paye.
Johnston's big advantage is that some powerful OECD members, notably the US,
want a non-European with both a political and an economic background in the
OECD's Paris headquarters. Johnston, aged 57, fits the bill - and he speaks
French. Described by one friend as 'approachable, very principled and very
independent-minded', he is a trained lawyer with a keen interest in
taxation, industrial strategy and development issues.
It was former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, an old client, who
persuaded him to enter politics in the 1970s. Johnson managed the trust into
which the prime minister had put his personal assets. He went on to hold
several middle-ranking cabinet portfolios until his Liberal Party lost the
1984 general election.
Then he sat on the opposition benches for four years as the Liberals'
finance and external affairs spokesman, but quit politics in 1988 after a
disagreement over the party's policy towards Quebec. He is currently the
party's president, or chief executive, and also sits on the board of BCE,
Canada's biggest public company.
Johnston tried to re-enter politics in the run-up to last year's general
election but he lost a messy battle for the Liberal nomination in his former
upper-crust Montreal constituency.
Last year's setback may turn out to have been a blessing in disguise.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not everybody was pleased by the appointment of Julio Sosa as Venezuela's
new finance minister, writes Joseph Mann. One left-wing opposition
politician suggested, in the charming manner that characterises Venezuelan
politics, that putting Sosa at the head of the finance ministry was like
'putting a vulture in charge of dead meat'.
Others have a higher opinion. Some businessmen and investors felt that Sosa
could emerge as a defender of free market policies or, at the very least,
could steer the new government away from economic blunders.
He will have his work cut out. As President Rafael Caldera began his
five-year term last Wednesday, Venezuela faces a profound economic crisis:
the economy is in recession and inflation rising. The government is short of
money because of the low price of oil and the country's second largest bank
collapsed last month.
Sosa has been close to the new president for decades, both as an adviser and
a friend. Caldera admits he is not an expert in economy and finance, and
will rely heavily on Sosa's opinions.
During the first Caldera presidency from 1969-74, Sosa refused a cabinet
position, but worked as ambassador to Washington. A father of nine children,
Sosa graduated in petroleum engineering in 1945. He studied at Cornell and
Oklahoma Universities in the US, as well as at Venezuela's Central
University.
He was born into a wealthy Venezuelan family and, after working as a
petroleum engineer and an academic, became a successful entrepreneur. He
founded and ran Industrias Venoco, a lubricants company, and set up a
commercial bank (Banco Orinoco) and an insurance company (Seguros Orinoco).
On his first day in office, Sosa was asked for his plans. He replied: 'Well,
I'm going to try to start doing what I'll be asking everyone else to do -
cutting costs.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / People: Coleman: the favourite for BankAmerica
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At 63, and with two of the biggest US bank takeovers under his belt, Richard
Rosenberg shows no sign of letting up. The BankAmerica chairman was in
ebullient mood recently as he announced the Dollars 1.9bn acquisition of
Continental Bank, a Chicago-based corporate bank. The money must now be on
his completing at least one more - perhaps of a big retail bank in his
native New England - before handing over the reins.
Rosenberg came late to the top job at the US's second-biggest bank. He was
already 60 when he took over in May 1990 after a retail banking career spent
largely at Wells Fargo, but also with brief spells at Crocker and Seafirst
(a BankAmerica subsidiary).
Age is unlikely to curtail his career soon. Tom Clausen, BankAmerica's last
chairman, did not step aside until he was 67. The two men have little else
in common; Clausen, who had led the World Bank, was one of the most
prominent international bankers of his generation. Rosenberg, on the other
hand, has earned a formidable reputation building retail banking businesses
first at Wells Fargo and more recently at BankAmerica.
When Rosenberg does decide to go, there is a clear favourite to follow him:
Lewis Coleman, a vice chairman of the bank and its chief financial officer.
Coleman, 51, is one of a group of senior Wells Fargo executives brought into
BankAmerica along with Rosenberg in the mid-1980s, and who now form the core
of the bank's management.
Unlike Rosenberg, Coleman has spent his career largely in wholesale and
international banking. That could prove no bad thing if BankAmerica seeks to
grow further from its west coast base to become more like the international
banking group that Clausen first moulded in the late 1970s.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Management: Auditing the auditors - As the results season
approaches, Andrew Jack looks at how to get the best out of the annual audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As auditors scurry to complete their work for companies with December
year-ends, now is the time for directors to concentrate on getting best
value for their money.
Managers too often view the audit as a time-consuming, annual chore. But by
negotiating fees, improving their internal planning, and asking the right
questions, boards can gain considerable benefits from an unloved exercise.
The first stage - which must begin long before the audit work gets under way
 -is to agree a reasonable fee with the auditor. Growing competition between
accounting firms and increasing concern among companies over fees means that
auditors cannot automatically just add a percentage to the previous year's
bill.
One increasingly popular technique for keeping fees low is to threaten to
put the audit out to tender.
'We have a fairly hard-nosed negotiation each year about audit fees with a
view that we could always go to someone else,' says Roderick Paul, chief
executive of Severn Trent, the privatised water company, whose audit firm is
Price Waterhouse. 'The thought of changing is always there.'
Background knowledge helps the process in this case. Paul and a fellow
director both trained as accountants and so have an understanding of
auditing from the other side of the fence. They also keep a close eye on the
reported audit fees charged to their competitors.
A second way to reduce audit fees is to be heavily involved at the planning
stage, ensuring that the exercise best meets the company's needs and links
most efficiently to its own systems and staff.
That leads to an estimate based on the hours likely to be needed and the
appropriate charge-out rates for different levels of staff and partners.
Paul says he holds extensive discussions over the plan for the audit, which
is agreed in advance with the executives and the company's audit committee.
'We consider to what extent it dovetails with the work of the internal audit
department.'
Michael Derbyshire, banking relations manager with Unilever, endorses this
approach. 'One of the ways of keeping the bill low is to keep a tight ship
with good internal controls,' he says.
Ensuring that the company meets its obligations within the audit plan is an
essential part of keeping costs down. Alan McFetrich, a senior partner with
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, recalls a client company in the late 1980s which demanded
that its audit fee of nearly Pounds 1m be reduced.
The firm agreed to a bill of about half the price, on condition that its
hours could be reduced through more efficient delivery of information by the
company being audited.
As it turned out, the client missed its deadlines and failed to deliver as
agreed, hence increasing the amount of work the auditors had to do, and
raising the final audit fee to more than Pounds 1m.
Once the audit is completed, there are other ways to squeeze value out of
the process. In particular, many executives and accountants point to the
need for detailed discussion and recommendations for change.
'You ought to expect auditors to bring their knowledge of similar
organisations and draw comparisons,' says Robert Sandry, a partner with
Price Waterhouse.
Martin Scicluna, a partner with Touche Ross, says: 'Ask the partners for
their off-the-record views on the strengths and weaknesses of the business,
systems and people, and for informal benchmarking with other companies,
which they can provide on a no-names basis.'
He adds that a good auditor should also draw the board's attention to the
likely impact of future accounting, auditing and regulatory changes which
might affect them in the coming year, giving them plenty of time to plan in
advance.
Most audits generate reports for management which highlight concerns raised
during the work and make recommendations. But an academic survey published
last year suggested that senior executives believe the letters are often
repetitive and could be substantially improved.
'The profession has an awful tendency to obfuscate,' says Roger Davis, head
of auditing at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'People don't want long, turgid reports
but simple language that says things as they are.'
The letter should, in any case, only be the starting point for a wider
discussion. Derbyshire recommends that boards should consider how the audit
worked. 'Where the auditors spent their time is quite revealing,' he says.
On the other hand, he warns against treating auditors' views too seriously.
'Sometimes they get hold of the wrong end of the stick and the real problem
is not what they highlight but something associated with it,' he says.
Paul is also suspicious of auditors veering too far into offering wider
consulting services, which may trigger conflicts of interest. 'We do pick up
on their comments but we try to focus on the auditing issues such as the
state of our systems,' he says.
As a last resort, if the audit bill still seems too high, directors always
have the option of sending it back and demanding a reduction. In the
extreme, they can always seek arbitration through the professional
accountancy bodies. As Paul says: 'Management gets the audit fee it
deserves.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / Management: An aspirin a day keeps doc away - A simple drug
with benefits for the heart / Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aspirin goes back to the brew of willow leaves Hippocrates concocted to
relieve labour pains in around 400 BC. In the 19th century the active
ingredient, salicylic acid, was used for fevers and rheumatism; this was
soon followed by the introduction of acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin.
Pain and fever are relieved by aspirin as it reduces the formation of
prostaglandins, substances which mediate inflammation. Taken half an hour
before eating, it may also be a useful treatment for some food
sensitivities. Importantly, aspirin blocks thrombosis by stopping platelets
clumping together. That anti-clotting action makes aspirin one of the most
effective remedies for 20th-century diseases.
Treatment with aspirin to prevent a second heart attack is now fairly
widespread; many people in middle-age and beyond take half an aspirin daily
after their first heart attack.
Aspirin can even help at the time of a suspected heart attack; it could save
many lives. New and expensive thrombolytic agents ('clotbusters') are not
suitable for everyone, but aspirin can make all the difference, especially
in the time before the patient reaches hospital when nearly a third of such
patients die.
As well as seeking medical help, anyone with crushing chest pains would be
well advised to take an aspirin right away. The recommended dose is 162.5 mg
or more; in the UK a standard aspirin containing 300 mg will do.
In angina, aspirin can help prevent clots forming in the narrowed parts of
arteries. It is especially useful in unstable angina, where attacks are
frequent and poorly controlled, and there is a one-in-six chance of a heart
attack occurring in the next 12 months.
In much the same way, the drug can help prevent strokes that are caused by
thrombosis. It may, however, worsen strokes due to bleeding, so it is
important to have a precise diagnosis.
In the British Medical Journal last month an overview of 150 trials
involving more than 100,000 patients was published. The analysis strongly
suggested that aspirin could help almost anyone with established blood
vessel narrowing in many parts of the body.
In patients at high risk, aspirin - like other anti-platelet treatments -
reduces the risk of death by about one sixth. The risk of non-fatal heart
attack and stroke is cut by about one third.
The message must be to give aspirin to anyone at risk of heart attack,
stroke or arterial narrowing in the legs unless there is a particular reason
to expect serious side effects.
Contrary to previous opinion, aspirin also helps prevent clots in veins.
Used around the time of major operations, it could halve the risk of
potentially fatal deep vein thrombosis.
In the laboratory, aspirin has been shown to inhibit the growth of induced
tumours in mice and rats. Now several studies in humans hint at a link
between aspirin intake and low risk of bowel cancer. This may be
cause-and-effect or some other kind of association - perhaps people who take
aspirin have healthier lifestyles, for instance.
Should everyone take aspirin routinely? The answer so far is no. There is no
suggestion that regular aspirin will do much for those already at low risk
of heart attack or stroke.
Aspirin does have a number of potential side-effects. It can, for instance,
cause gastric bleeding and ulcers, and in some people produce severe
allergic reactions. It can damage the kidney and perhaps the liver, which is
why paracetamol is the preferred pain-reliever for the under-12s. For those
at low risk of heart attack or stroke, the risk/benefit ratio increases as
side-effects become more important.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel: Estimated time of arrival: two days late -
Readers' distressing airline experiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We recently asked travellers to tell us their tales of obstructive airlines
and how to overcome them. Readers told us of flights delayed for days and of
messages to families that were never delivered. One complaining passenger
was warned that the airline was big and he was not; if he took legal action,
the company would appeal on every procedural point until the traveller ran
out of money.
The most startling story was of a passenger on a delayed aircraft in New
York, who was forced by security guards to hand over film from his camera
because he had taken pictures on board.
A persistent theme of the letters we received was the airlines' attempts to
fob passengers off with flimsy excuses and inadequate compensation. Mr David
Darby, a London patent agent, wrote to Continental Airlines last August
about a flight his wife and two children had been scheduled to make from
Newark, New Jersey, to London. Because the flight was overbooked, they were
put on an aircraft to Frankfurt, with three Dollars 200 vouchers as
compensation.
Mr Darby wrote to the airline to say his family were entitled to cash under
European Community regulations. Continental wrote back to say they were not,
as the journey began in the US and not the EC.
Not true, Mr Darby wrote back. The regulations covered flights starting or
ending in the EC. You are quite right, a Continental customer relations
official replied. 'I must apologise that the previous correspondence was not
factual,' she said. Mr Darby's perseverance paid off.
Mr Chandrakant Rabheru, however, a director of a London import and export
company, has been waiting 16 months for a written explanation of why his
family in the UK was not informed that his British Airways flight from
Bombay had been delayed. The flight, which was due to leave Bombay for
London at 1.05am on October 11 1992, finally departed at 6.45 in the
evening. Mr Rabheru says he gave BA four alternative telephone and fax
numbers on which to contact his family. BA staff in Bombay told him his
relations had been informed. They had not.
Mr Rabheru, a regular BA customer, says the airline apologised on the
telephone, but his requests for a written explanation were ignored. BA says
it has since transferred all complaints to a new computer system to ensure a
quicker response. However, Mr Rabheru's complaint predated the system and BA
can no longer trace it.
None of the stories we received, however, matched the drama of a Virgin
Atlantic flight to London, scheduled to leave JFK airport in New York at
7.15pm on Friday, January 7.
Mr Michael Walsh, group finance director of public relations consultants
Dewe Rogerson, who was on the flight, says passengers boarded the aircraft
but were told take-off would be delayed while de-icing took place. Then they
were told a navigation instrument was faulty.
Passengers asked for something to eat and drink, but were told they had to
be ready to take off at any time. They were not given anything to eat until
after midnight. At 2.30am the captain announced that the flight had been
cancelled.
They were taken to a hotel in New York and eventually told that their flight
would be leaving at 7pm on Saturday. But there were further delays due to
icy conditions. At 3am on Sunday, the aircraft took off. Shortly afterwards,
passengers heard there was a further problem with it, and that they would be
returning to JFK. They arrived back at their hotel at 5am on Sunday.
Mr Walsh was then told he had been booked on a flight leaving JFK at 9pm on
Sunday. He arrived home in London at 10.15am on Monday, two days later than
planned.
Mr Richard Hamersley, a London solicitor, was on the same flight. While
waiting to take off on the Friday night, he decided to photograph a Virgin
representative who was assuring passengers all would be well.
Two Virgin security guards, one armed, asked him to step behind a curtain on
the aircraft. 'The thoroughly unpleasant verbal assault that (then) took
place was quite unjustified in the circumstances,' he wrote to Virgin on his
return.
He says he was taken to the front of the aircraft in full view of his fellow
passengers and made to hand the film to the captain. (The captain later
returned it to him by post.) He wrote to the company: 'Your security guards
were unable to give me any authority for their proposition that my
photograph was illegally taken.'
Passengers were handed written apologies from Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's
chairman. Mr Walsh has reached a compensation agreement with Virgin. The
company says it is investigating Mr Hamersley's complaint.
Of course, the letters we received represent a tiny proportion of flights
taken by our readers. Most flights pass without incident. What is
noticeable, however, is readers' long memories of those that go wrong.
Mr Peter Tray, owner of a London export/import concern, recalls a flight he
took in 1953 from Switzerland with British European Airways, one of BA's
predecessors. Because of fog in London, passengers were put on a Swissair
flight to Paris, where no one from BEA knew anything about them.
Spotting a BEA aircraft on the tarmac, the nine passengers concerned found
an airline representative and demanded to be flown home. Mr Tray recalls:
'He could only splutter: 'But you can't possibly expect me to authorise an
aircraft for just nine passengers.' In the best pantomime tradition, we all
chorused: 'Oh yes, we can.' '
If he didn't, they told him, they would debag him. They were flown home.
Those were the days.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Help for EU airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union transport ministers meet this week in Athens to discuss plans
to help European airlines, which lost a combined Dollars 2.2bn in 1992.
Countries such as France and Italy are in favour of increased aid for the
industry while others, including the UK, are pressing for limits to
subsidies and more competition.
Meanswhile, the 221 world airlines of the International Air Transport
Association last week reported strong growth in air traffic but no profits
last year. Passenger traffic rose 6 per cent in 1993, but the airlines still
expect to report a net loss on the year.
While some companies are profitable, many more have made large losses.
Cut-price offers have not made up for a decline in the amount of lucrative
business travel.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel: Seat without a view - Why it is
increasingly difficult to see through aircraft windows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As we cruise at 37,000 feet, passengers on the right-hand side of the
aircraft can enjoy a spectacular view of the Greenland ice-cap glinting in
the sun . . .' Or rather, they could if it were not for the sunlight
glinting back from the network of tiny cracks on the outside of the cabin
windows.
This 'crazing' of the plastic (acrylic) windows fitted to cabins of all
modern aircraft often irritates frequent flyers, whose view is obscured by
eye-wearying dazzle. And airlines confirm passengers' impressions that the
problem has become much worse over the past two years or so.
Scientists say the cause of the current crazing epidemic is a large increase
in the concentration of sulphuric acid droplets in the atmosphere.
Volcanic er-uptions are ultimately responsible. The main culprit is Mount
Pinatubo in the Philippines, which has released an estimated 20m tonnes of
sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere since June 1991.
'Although the acid concentration is now falling, there are still 10 times
more suphuric acid particles in the atmosphere than there were before the
eruption, and it will take several years to get back to the pre-Pinatubo
level,' says Dr Lamont Poole, an atmospheric specialist with the US National
Aeronautic and Space Administration.
Crazing is not a safety issue because it only affects the windows' outer
surface and does not weaken their structure. (Cockpit windows are made of
glass laminate, not plastic, and are not affected by acid.)
Even so, airlines are responding to their passengers' concern by changing
cabin windows more frequently than before. The acrylic is designed to have a
normal working life of 20,000 flying hours, equivalent to five years of
operation. But British Airways, for example, now checks all windows every 15
to 18 months and finds that many need to be replaced then.
The long-term solution is to develop new windows with greater acid
resistance. BA has a joint programme with Boeing, the US aircraft
manufacturer, to flight test alternative materials. One BA 747-400 jumbo jet
is flying with 11 different window types fitted by Boeing; another has four
more types made to BA's own specification.
'Our long-term goal is window working life that pushes the current five-year
norm to eight years,' says Mr Russ Jones, BA chief fleet engineer.
Meanwhile Pilkington Aerospace, California-based subsidiary of the UK glass
company, is promoting CrystalVue, a new cabin window which it says is two to
three times more resistant to crazing than previous materials. Its acrylic
composition absorbs less water from the atmosphere - low water absorption
reduces acid attack - and for additional protection it is coated with a thin
layer of polysiloxane.
Pilkington's launch customer, Japan Airlines, has flown Boeing 747s fitted
with CrystalVue for up to 20,000 hours on its polar routes, where there is
greater exposure to acid than at lower latitudes. All the passengers still
have a craze-free view of the ice cap.

FT  07 FEB 94 / EU monetary body enjoys Bank approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Monetary Institute, which started operating last month, should
be able to help European Union central banks control inflation, the Bank of
England believes, Peter Norman writes.
In an article released ahead of tomorrow's Quarterly Bulletin the Bank says
that the institute 'should be able to contribute to robust
counter-inflationary monetary policies' by monitoring policies and
recommending changes.
The article, timed to appear before tomorrow's meeting of the institute's
decision-making council, makes clear that the Bank wants the institute to
play a constructive role in Europe's economic future.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Profits of gilts dealers decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in UK government bonds - gilts - saw a decline in their profits last
year in spite of the continued strong performance of the market, the Bank of
England says.
The dealers showed a combined post-tax profit of Pounds 59m, down 8 per cent
from Pounds 64m in 1992.
The post-tax return on average capital fell to 9 per cent last year from 13
per cent in 1992, according to the Bank, which released its annual report on
developments in the gilt market yesterday before the publication of its
February Quarterly Bulletin.
The fall in dealers' profits is set against a strong market, which benefited
from the improvement in inflation and the decline in UK interest rates, and
which remained undeterred by the government's large borrowing requirement.
Turnover in the market rose from a daily average of Pounds 4.9bn in 1992 to
Pounds 6.3bn last year. At the end of March UK investors owned 80.3 per cent
of total gilt holdings and overseas investors owned 19.7 per cent.
The rate of return on 10-year gilts was 19.4 per cent last year, up from
18.7 per cent the previous year, the Bank said.
Last year was particularly good for the European government bond markets,
and the gilt market was one of the better performing fixed-income markets
although it was outstripped by the high-yielding Italian and Spanish
markets.
The Bank points out that dealers made more money in 1992 helped by 'two
particularly sharp market movements . . . associated with the general
election and the period following the suspension of sterling's membership of
the ERM'. But profits were made on a more consistent basis last year, helped
by the sustained rise in gilt prices for much of the period.
The decline in the post-tax return on capital reflects the increase in
capital employed, as the number of dealers involved in the market rose and
individual firms injected capital for their various other fixed-income
activities.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Bank backs fixed mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has made clear that it would like to see more UK
mortgages with fixed interest rates because this would make the operation of
monetary policy less costly to homeowners.
The Bank notes in an analysis of fixed and floating-rate finance in the UK
and abroad that the overwhelming majority of British mortgages are at
variable rates, in contrast to the practice in most developed industrialised
countries. It also notes that UK household mortgage debt relative to gross
domestic product is, at 60 per cent, higher than elsewhere.
This means mortgage borrowers in Britain can be subject to 'dramatic and
hard-to-predict variability in the proportion of income that needs to be
used to meet payment obligations'. Recent buyers, in particular, can suffer
'crippling' increases in outlays when the monetary authorities raise real
interest rates to counter inflationary pressures.
The Bank's observations, in an article released ahead of publication of its
Quarterly Bulletin tomorrow, will be familiar to many families which
suffered sharply higher mortgage repayments after base rates were raised
from 7.5 per cent in May 1988 to 15 per cent in October 1989.
The Bank concludes that the most important effect of more fixed-rate
mortgage debt on monetary policy would be a reduction in the sharp impact of
short-term interest rate rises on the cashflow of specific households and
corporations. 'This would allow interest rates to be increased quickly but
at lower cost - in terms of induced liquidity problems - to the private
sector.'
Half the mortgages granted by banks and building societies in the third
quarter of last year were at rates fixed for more than one year compared
with 17 per cent in the second quarter of 1992. But the Bank notes that
demand for this type of loan 'might evaporate' if money-market rates remain
stable for an extended period.

FT  07 FEB 94 / George argues for independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday spelt out his
vision for an independent central bank in a rare television interview.
Granting independence to the Bank would be the 'most likely' way of
achieving long-term, sustainable growth with low inflation, he said, but
this could only happen when there was a consensus on the case for monetary
stability.
'I think it would be helpful if there were that understanding,' he said. 'It
would help us to achieve price stability which would enable the economy to
grow in a more stable way and help reduce the risks of boom and bust.'
Mr George, appearing on London Weekend Television's Walden programme, said
it was appropriate to talk about a switch to independent accountability for
the Bank, rather than pure independence.
'Our task would be specified within a statutory framework set out by the
government,' he said. He envisaged that parliament would define the
objectives of monetary policy by setting an inflation target.
Mr George agreed politicians had become more attuned to the dangers of
inflation but said they remained subject to short-term pressures which might
make them take a risk which the Bank would not.
Mr George denied that the Bank would be 'consistently tighter' on interest
rates than under present arrangements.
He and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saw 'very much eye to eye' in the
present circumstances. 'But there would be circumstances where we would want
to see interest rates higher than the government, because we would not be
facing the same short-term political pressures.'
The governor indicated that tomorrow's inflation report from the Bank would
contain a much more positive assessment of the long-term prospects for
inflation.
'The recorded level of inflation is increasing as it is bound to do because
of the impact of indirect tax increases, but the underlying level of
inflation is comfortably within the government's target for the time being,'
he said. 'We don't expect it to rise over the far-out period but you will
have to wait to see the detail.'
Many City analysts believe the government will cut interest rates before the
end of the year to soften the impact of tax increases. But there is a
growing feeling that it will not want to take any risks with inflation and
that the next move in interest rates will be up.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Buoyant consumer borrowing confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two reports out today confirm the renewed buoyancy of consumer borrowing as
the economy continues to recover, Emma Tucker writes.
The Finance and Leasing Association reports that borrowing in December
sustained November's sharp rise.
The association - which represents companies providing consumer credit,
business finance and leasing, and motor finance - says consumer credit was
36 per cent higher in December year-on-year, and 7 per cent up on November.
Spending on store cards increased 24 per cent year-on-year while personal
loans were up 40 per cent over the same period. Figures for the whole of
last year showed an increase of 25 per cent in consumer credit.
Infolink, the credit information group, says that while demand for consumer
loans varied in the final quarter of last year the underlying trend was
growth.
Neither M0, the narrow measure of money supply, nor M4, the broad measure,
are likely to share a common relationship with inflation, says an article in
the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin tomorrow.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Russian money aids a bear market: Two years after the
collapse of the Soviet Union a new breed of big spender is coming to London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Davos, Switzerland Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former Russian finance
minister, observes that 'flats bought by Russians are helping the London
property market very much'.
Nearby, a Swiss banker notes that there is a 'huge cash business coming out
of Russia - no one knows where it is going'.
Meanwhile on London's Bond Street an exclusive jeweller is delighted by the
recent surge it has seen in Russian customers.
Two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union a new breed of Russian
business person - and Russian money - is beginning to arrive in western
capitals.
The scale of the capital flight is startling.
Last year official assets from the former Soviet Union held by Western banks
doubled to almost Dollars 18bn, with about Dollars 4.4bn of this held in
London. Much of this is accounted for by Russian businesses and banks but
anecdotal evidence suggests that some significant fortunes held by Russia's
new elite are hidden away in these accounts. In London alone at least Pounds
50m worth of property is estimated to have been purchased by buyers from the
former Soviet Union in the past two years, some by companies and some by
newly rich individuals.
Mr Nikolai Chertvertakov, a former employee at the Russian trade delegation
in London and now a business consultant, said: 'Many Russian businessmen are
buying homes in London. They come to rest and to work.' He said that London
was a favoured haven for three reasons: the high value Russians attach to
the English language and education system; its position as a financial
centre; and above all, its proximity to the metal, mineral and oil exchanges
 -an area which has proved highly lucrative for both legal and illegal
Russian exporters in the past.
Although the influx is tiny compared with the 1970s spending sprees of the
Middle East's oil-rich, it is already presenting both an opportunity and a
problem for London financial institutions which fear that some of the money
might be from less-than-reputable sources.
Russians themselves are keen to minimise this threat, arguing that criminal
money forms only a fraction of funds arriving in the west. But the chaotic
nature of the Russian legal system means that distinguishing the legal from
the illegal is often extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, as bankers point out, most of the money arriving in London is
doing so by locally legitimate means.
Russian regulations stipulate that Russians can only open offshore bank
accounts with the Russian Central Bank's permission, and restrict most
Russian companies from exporting their hard-currency profits or investing
them overseas.
Russian businesses and individuals are usually able to circumvent this by
setting up a joint-venture or overseas company subject to local law.
Mr Bill Newman, assistant general manager of Narodny Bank, a British bank
whose main shareholder is the Russian state bank, said: 'There is an awful
lot of Russian money swirling around, but much of that comes out quite
legally from Russian banks and businesses. The Latin American experience
shows that when you have hyper-inflation and a collapse in the exchange rate
you will see an outflow of capital.'
Either way, the trend has left some estate agents in London celebrating. One
estimates that in the past two years more than 70 purchases have been made
in London by Russians - with most sales between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds
2m.
Estate agents say most of these sales are cash-based, using offshore funds
from banks or companies based in a low-tax jurisdiction. One estate agent,
Benham Reeves, has been so impressed by the increase that it is talking to a
bank based on the Isle of Man about establishing a special offshore payment
system for Russians.
Some buyers have been Russian companies, operating as joint ventures from
London or an offshore base. The Russian Rosal trading group provides a
fairly typical example.
A British-Russian joint venture based in Monaco for tax purposes, the
company trades in metals from the Siberian area and has bought properties in
north London for the use of its employees.
Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Most construction group in Moscow, has
bought property in London and Portugal registered as company-owned to
minimise his tax bill. He is, he says, particularly fond of the Chelsea
area.
Other Russians have been purchasing private properties more openly. Mr Nick
Gilchrist, of Lassmans estate agents, which has sold about five properties
to Russians around the Pounds 1m mark, recently sold a Pounds 1m property to
a Russian business family from St Petersburg.
Mr Gilchrist said: 'They were wanting a family home because they are putting
their daughter through further education here.' He added that the family
arrived with a beautiful collection of Russian antiques.
Artwork and jewellery has proved to be a particularly popular purchase for
some Russians. A Swiss banker said: 'We think a lot of this (Russian) money
must be coming out through jewellery and things like that.' At his bank more
than 150 new accounts had recently been opened by Russians, albeit mostly
for sums of less than SFr1m (Pounds 463,000).
Mr Ivan Samarin, Russian expert at Sotheby's auction house, said that
whereas five years ago 'there would have been no Russian buyers at the
auctions of Russian art, now there might be up to a dozen'. Mr Alexis
Tiesenhausen, Christie's Russian expert, said that although these clients
were financially as sophisticated an any western client, they were
'extremely quiet and secretive'.
Cartier, the luxury-goods shop, said it had seen a big increase in Russian
clients in the last year, buying watches, jewellery and other luxury goods -
almost always with cash. Garrards, the Bond Street jeweller, reported a
similar surge not only from Russians but Serbians as well.
Russians have also been spending money on education. Oakley Hall school in
Gloucestershire launched an advertising campaign in Russia last year. It
attracted 18 Russian pupils at Pounds 7,335 a year each.
Their parents include a banker, a doctor, a Mercedes-Benz car dealer, the
owner of a pharmaceutical company and the director and deputy director of a
factory in Siberia.
Mr John Rawlinson, the school's headmaster and a former merchant banker,
said: 'In several cases the family have got business interests here, which
is very convenient because they can take the children out for half-term.
What the parents do is come over here - perhaps they buy a house and have
the mother live in it.'
Fee payments are made in a range of hard currencies, using an 'innovative'
system, according to Mr Rawlinson. One set of parents paid through both a
German and American bank. And although he has turned away one suspicious
parent who arrived at the school with cash in hand, Mr Rawlinson is
confident that the business can expand, with about 100 pupils projected to
arrive at a range of British private schools next year under a scheme he is
in the process of setting up.
'A lot of schools have already trawled the Far Eastern market.' he said.
'There's huge potential in Russia.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / Major and Reynolds aim to restore united front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish prime ministers are to meet in London later this month
to restore a common front to efforts to find a political settlement in
Northern Ireland.
The talks are expected to be on February 19 when Mr Albert Reynolds will be
in London for the England-Ireland rugby international. The meeting follows
the refusal of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, to indicate during his
controversial New York visit that the IRA was prepared to renounce its
campaign of violence.
Growing pessimism in London about the prospects of an early end to IRA
terrorism in response to December's Downing Street declaration prompted Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to announce last week that
he would table fresh ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's
constitutional parties.
Sir Patrick's announcement caused irritation in Dublin. The Irish government
had indicated privately to London that it would prefer such negotiations to
remain on hold until after Sinn Fein's party conference at the end of the
month.
Last night Mr Reynolds increased pressure on Sinn Fein to give a response to
the call for peace. He said time was running out for a response and he
expected either acceptance or rejection of the declaration by the time of
the party conference. He told a meeting of the Fianna Fail party in Dublin
that he had provided 'copious clarification' of the document in response to
requests from Mr Adams.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said that political talks on
Northern Ireland will go ahead 'with or without Sinn Fein'.
In spite of Britain's determination to press ahead with constitutional talks
Mr John Major is anxious that there should be no rift with Mr Reynolds
because the process depends on maintaining the united front established by
the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Major is expected to reassure Mr Reynolds that Britain is not aiming for
a 'minimalist' political settlement which would involve no more than the
establishment of devolved government in Ulster.
That option is being pressed hard by the Ulster Unionist party. But British
ministers recognise that the the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party will not accept the creation of a new assembly unless there is
an overall agreement encompassing north-south relations and links between
London and Dublin.
Mr Major will tell Mr Reynolds that he wants to push ahead with this
'three-stranded' approach. He will also make it clear that the search for a
political settlement would not preclude a place at the table for Sinn Fein
if the IRA did end its terrorist campaign.

FT  07 FEB 94 / PIA seeks to reassure investors and potential members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The draft prospectus in which the proposed Personal Investment Authority
sets out its stall is designed to reassure both investors and the firms it
intends to regulate.
Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, calls the authority a new type of
self-regulating organisation, defining itself on the basis of the customer
rather than a category of product or advice.
Investors are told that they can look to the PIA for assurance that its
members will give them suitable advice and will not defraud them.
Potential members are told that the authority will take account of the
impact of regulation on the market, in terms of the benefit to consumers and
the burden on the industry, particularly small businesses.
How the PIA will operate: The prospectus defends the decision - which has
met considerable opposition in the financial services industry - that the
19-strong board should be made up of nine practitioners, nine
public-interest directors, including the chairman and the chief executive.
The Financial Services Act, it says, requires a self-regulating organisation
to have a 'proper balance' between industry interests and the public
interest.
The section also sets out the board's relatively streamlined committee
structure.
The industry will be involved in decision-taking through working groups and
task forces, and through staff secondments to the PIA.
Each proposal for new rules put to the board must be accompanied by a
compliance-costs assessment.
Costs and compensation: The PIA estimates its 1994-95 budget at Pounds
29.5m, including Pounds 5.5m in fees to the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, and Pounds 1m for operating an ombudsman
and arbitration scheme.
The Pounds 6m set-up costs, incurred since spring 1992, are intended to be
written off over five years, adding Pounds 1.2m to first-year costs. But it
expects to raise Pounds 1.5m from other sources, taking total revenue needed
for the first year to Pounds 29.2m.
First-year fees for members will be about 20 per cent higher than their
1994-95 payments to existing regulators, in a flat increase across all
classes of member. The ways of calculating regulatory fees may be adjusted
after the first two years.
The PIA will have a cap of Pounds 100m for its liabilities under the
Investors' Compensation Scheme, which recompenses customers who cannot
obtain redress from the firms which advised them because they have gone into
default.
Maximum exposure for independent practitioners in any one year will be
Pounds 9.5m.
Joining: In looking at applications the authority will consider a range of
factors, including proof that the firm has appropriate professional
indemnity insurance cover and whether it is 'organised and motivated' to
comply with the rules.
The authority will be able to decide for itself whether to accept any firm.
It will also be able to give conditional acceptance.
Being a member: Members will comply with the training and competence
arrangements set by existing regulators. In the longer-term, the PIA may
impose higher standards.
All members must have a minimum of Pounds 10,000 capital, with higher
amounts set for larger firms and those which handle clients' money.
Monitoring will be linked to the admissions process. Information acquired
then will decide the firm's risk categorisation which will affect, for
example, how often it receives inspection visits.
In the short-term the PIA will maintain large sections of existing
rulebooks, but there will be new rules in 11 areas.
Service to investors: A 10 to 15-member consumer panel chaired by one of the
public-interest directors will be set up and consulted on
investor-protection proposals. It will produce an annual report on the PIA's
effectiveness.
If a complaint against a firm remains unsettled the customer will have the
right to go to an ombudsman, whose bureau will act independently.

FT  07 FEB 94 / SIB stands by pensions survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Invest-ments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
yesterday defended the methods it used in a recent survey of pension
transfers.
SIB had been criticised by Fimbra, one of the self-regulatory bodies
responsible for overseeing sales agents, over its use of a list of Fimbra
members conducting pensions transfer business.
Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, which oversees independent
financial advisers, said the SIB study, which was carried out by accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick, included a disproportionate number of firms where there
were problems. He said: 'We deliberately included at least one firm where we
knew there were problems with eight out of 11 files.'
However, SIB and KPMG yesterday said the selection of firms was completely
random. KPMG had reviewed files at companies chosen from a list supplied by
Fimbra which included the name of every member which had carried out pension
transfer business.
They said that remarks by Mr Jillings, that 'in the Fimbra element of the
sample bad firms had a higher than random element of being selected', were
untrue.
SIB said it had asked Fimbra last summer to determine which of its members
conducted pension transfer business and learned that 1,500 of its 6,500
members did so.
Mr Jillings said the adverse publicity had created severe difficulties for
some independent financial advisers. Insurers had raised premiums for
personal indemnity insurance by between 300 per cent and 400 per cent.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Leasing rejected for five collieries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal has decided against offering the five pits earmarked last week
for closure to the private sector on a lease and licence basis.
The five pits are Ellington, in Northumberland, Ollerton, Manton and
Annesley in Nottinghamshire, and Goldthorpe in South Yorkshire.
Executives are debating whether to include the mothballed pits in the five
packages they are preparing for the industry's privatisation later this
year. That would give purchasers the option of re-opening them if they
thought the market warranted it.
The other option would be to offer the pits for sale as stand-alone pits.
In the past year British Coal has offered 27 pits for leasing and licensing
after closing them. Time and resource constraints influenced its decision to
treat differently the pits earmarked for closure last week.
The corporation is already working on the content of the five packages.
Putting out five more pits on a tender basis would have caused confusion for
prospective buyers of the packages, British Coal believes.
The leasing and licensing of the 28 pits has attracted a surprisingly large
amount of interest from private-sector companies. Of the first 19 pits that
were put out to tender, six are now either in the hands of the private
sector or soon will be.
About 700 of the 1,100 miners at Ellington voted at a meeting yesterday not
to accept the planned closure later this month. The decision means that the
pit's future will now be decided through the industry's colliery review
procedure, which could delay closure for nine months.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first pay settlements of the year suggest a modest upturn in the level
of rises, with a growing number of private-sector deals at 3 per cent and
above, Incomes Data Services, the information and research organisation,
says.
IDS said negotiations over pay were likely to become tougher. The inflation
rate for January was expected to be 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent and there was
growing awareness of the impact of the tax and National Insurance increases
coming into effect in April.
Similar predictions are made by Industrial Relations Services, also a
research organisation, in its latest analysis of pay and benefits.
It says that a car worker on Pounds 12,750 a year will pay about 2.83 per
cent of salary in extra tax by April next year as a result of the Budget. A
top civil servant earning more than Pounds 90,000 will pay less than 1 per
cent more of earnings.

Senior executives of Independent Newspapers of Ireland plan to hold talks
today with the management of The Independent newspaper in London.
The talks follow last week's coup by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of the Irish
Independent, when he bought 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, owner of
The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, from institutions at Pounds
3.50 a share. As the largest shareholder the Irish group is seeking board
representation and is likely to get it.
Meanwhile, discussions are continuing between members of the consortium that
last week offered Pounds 2.60 a share. The consortium includes Mirror Group
Newspapers, the existing Independent shareholders El Pas of Spain and La
Repubblica of Italy, and the founders of The Independent led by Mr Andreas
Whittam Smith.

FT  07 FEB 94 / BNF in studies on Thorp successor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels is already carrying out research into a possible
successor to the long-delayed Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant at
Sellafield, Cumbria, which faces a final challenge at the High Court in
London today.
The state-owned company said: 'Like any international company that leads its
field, we're looking into new technologies as they progress, but we are not
planning a second Thorp plant and not designing anything.'
Thorp is designed to operate for at least 25 years but it is based on
research done in the 1960s and 1970s. The process of designing, planning,
building and commissioning the plant has taken almost 20 years - delayed
partly by strong opposition from environmental campaigners.
The last move in that opposition takes place at the High Court today when
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, and Lancashire County Council
seek a judicial review of the government's decision to allow Thorp to start
operating. The challengers say there should be a new public inquiry.

FT  07 FEB 94 / BT may abolish peak-rate charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses are set to gain from sweeping price reductions to be announced
soon by British Telecommunications, Andrew Adonis writes.
The reductions are likely to focus on the weekday peak rate for calls made
between 9am and 1pm. This band may be abolished outright which would cost BT
more than Pounds 300m in a full year and mainly benefit business users.
By the summer BT is pledged to reduce prices by the overall equivalent of
7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation, under an agreement with Oftel,
the telecommunications regulator.
Recent price cuts have mainly benefited residential customers and the next
round of cuts, which will mainly benefiting businesses, will fulfil most of
the agreements with Oftel for the year to July.
Mercury, BT's main competitor, is likely to follow suit in any price
reductions. It usually announces cuts to coincide with those made by BT.
If the peak-rate band is abolished, only two charge bands will remain for
weekdays - a 'standard' band for calls made between 8am and 6pm and an
'off-peak' band for calls made at other times.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Conservatives take Euro-sceptic line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's plan to give a distinctly sceptical edge to his party's
European election campaign was confirmed at the weekend with a warning that
a Tory defeat would mark a victory for Brussels centralism.
But there were signs last night that in spite of evidence that the tactic
would win popular support, it is likely to generate fresh tensions between
the pro and anti-European wings of the party.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said the Tory campaign would focus on the
'crucial difference' between the government and opposition parties. Labour
and Liberal Democrats wanted to transfer more power to Brussels, the
Conservatives did not.
He told a Young Conservatives' conference in Southport, Merseyside that he
was determined that the June elections should not be trivialised by the
opposition as a mid-term opinion poll. He added: 'We know after polling day
the centralists in Brussels would treat defeat for us as a victory for
European centralism.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / Fightback starts against tobacco advert controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Association today starts a fightback against proposals
circulating in Whitehall for tighter controls - including tax penalties - on
tobacco advertising.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is expected to announce this
week plans for a fresh round of talks with tobacco manufacturers on
voluntary controls.
The government had hoped to announce tighter controls before parliament
debates a private member's bill, put forward by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP
for Rother Valley, which would outlaw almost all tobacco advertising on
health grounds.
The bill is to be given its second reading on Friday.
But Mrs Bottomley has been unable to win cabinet agreement for a package of
controls - including a ban on poster advertising - drawn up by the
Department of Health .
The cabinet appears to be divided over the issue, with some ministers
backing an advertising ban while others believe a ban would impinge on
personal freedom and reduce revenue from tobacco taxes.
Mrs Bottomley is believed to be considering whether the government could
finance an advertising campaign to ram home the dangers of smoking,
particularly to young and female cigarette buyers. An alternative proposal
being mooted is a scheme to prevent manufacturers from offsetting their
advertising costs - about Pounds 60m a year - against profits.
The Advertising Association, the umbrella group for both clients and
practitioners in the industry, says that a ban or the introduction of
financial penalties would be a 'frightening prospect'.
A document being sent to all MPs argues that an advertising ban would not
reduce consumption. Potentially more effective measures, such as improving
health education, restricting smoking in public places and raising prices,
would be expensive or unpopular, it says, while 'advertising is an easier
target'.
The association is also accusing Italy, Portugal, France and Spain of being
top of a 'liars' league' of European Union member states in favouring an
EU-wide ban on tobacco advertising. It says these countries argue for a ban
on health grounds but are in fact acting to keep out foreign imports to
protect state-owned industries.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Optimism on global warming targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is on course to meet international targets on curbing the risk of
global warming because of the switch to electricity generated from gas
rather than coal, a research group says today.
The recession and new fuel taxes also play a part in enabling the UK to meet
its commitments, Cambridge Econometrics says.
The UK has pledged to bring emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels
 -160m tonnes of carbon (mtC) - in the year 2000, a cut of about 6 per cent
on projected levels. But the group is more pessimistic than the government
about the impact of taxes on the growth in transport. It predicts that new
motoring taxes will cut emissions by only 1.7 mtC, compared with the 2.5 mtC
predicted by the government.
It is more optimistic on the effect of value added tax on household fuel,
however. It expects that it will cut 1.5 mtC from household emissions, and a
further 1.7 mtC from related electricity generation.
The group suggests that a carbon-energy tax of the kind proposed by the
European Commission would be more environmentally effective than UK fiscal
measures. The proposed European tax would hit households less hard than the
imposition of value added tax on fuel, it says. The UK has opposed the tax,
saying it would make industry internationally uncompetitive.

FT  07 FEB 94 / British show little liking for work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British have the most negative attitudes to work to be found in Europe,
says the continent's most extensive survey of employee satisfaction.
However, a UK company, British Shoe, was one of the five best individual
companies in International Survey Research's annual survey, based on results
from more than 500 businesses.
The Swiss emerge as the most satisfied, and - Britain excepted - the
Protestant work ethic appears alive and well.
Employees in northern countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium
and Switzerland responded far more positively to their employment than those
in France, Spain and Italy.
Employees were asked to give their views on 17 aspects of working life
including company management, immediate supervision, training and
information, pay, job security and job satisfaction.
The Swiss came top in 16 categories out of 17 with an average positive
response of 70 per cent. The British had the least favourable attitudes in
10 categories out of 17 with an average mark of 54 per cent.
The overall satisfaction level of European employees remained constant
between 1992-93 and 1993-94, but this masked a number of changes. Attitudes
in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain deteriorated markedly during the year,
although the Netherlands still came second and Belgium fourth.
Germany, which came third, saw a slight rise after a sharp decline in
1992-93. The 7 per cent improvement in attitudes towards product quality was
the strongest positive trend recorded for any country or category.
The categories attracting the lowest favourable responses were pay (42 per
cent) where France had the lowest figure of all, and communications (46 per
cent) where the UK was bottom. The categories attracting the most favourable
response were job satisfaction, working relationships and operating
efficiency.
The individual European companies which scored highest were Texas
Instruments, the semiconductor and electronics manufacturer; DHL, the
distribution company; and Nokia Mobile Phones.
Mr Roger Maitland of International Survey Research said it was useful for
individual companies to measure their employee response against a country
norm.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein peppered by ceasefire calls: The IRA's political
wing has heard a plea for peace from the grassroots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A message from grassroots public opinion was hammered home to the leadership
of Sinn Fein at the weekend. It said clearly that a continuation of the IRA
military campaign was an obstacle to progress in the peace process.
The refusal by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to rush into a response
to December's Downing Street declaration may smack of pedantry,
procrastination and downright deviousness. But if the message that was
repeatedly stated at the latest hearing of its 'Peace Commission' has found
its target, then the wait will have been worth it.
The Sinn Fein Peace Commission consists of a series of public hearings in
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in which written and oral
submissions on the peace process and the Downing Street declaration are
being invited from the public.
The first was held in Londonderry two weeks ago. The second was held this
weekend in a Dublin hotel and two more are scheduled to be held in the
republic before Sinn Fein's annual congress at the end of this month.
Somewhat surprisingly, the submissions made in Dublin were neither
acrimonious diatribes from opponents, nor eulogies of regurgitated
republicanism from sympathisers. For the most part they were carefully
argued presentations, coming from people as diverse as Jesuit priests, trade
unionists, community associations, civil rights activists, peace groups
hostile to Sinn Fein, writers and even musicians.
One of the most cogent presentations came from Mr Michael Farrell, a
solicitor and civil-rights activist who is widely respected in republican
and nationalist circles.
He started by arguing that the joint declaration and the British government
had failed to address nationalist fears adequately. But he went on to say
that Sinn Fein had been 'unconvincing' in trying to draw a distinction
between the joint declaration's guarantee to respect the majority wishes in
Northern Ireland - described by Sinn Fein as the unionist 'veto' - and the
Hume-Adams statements which the IRA supports, which speak of the need for
unionist consent to any new political settlement.
Moreover, continuation of the IRA campaign while clarification of the
Downing Street declaration was being sought 'is irresponsible and
inconsistent with (the IRA's) own support for the Hume-Adams proposals' he
said.
'Whatever the situation in the past, the means are now in place to allow
republicans to secure their objectives by political action. I do not believe
the IRA's armed struggle could achieve anything more. Indeed I think it is
counter-productive,' he said.
Most of the 25 submissions carried a similar message. The British government
should be pressed to offer guarantees to protect the civil rights and Irish
identity of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, to balance the
'fulsome guarantees offered to the unionists'. But in spite of this weakness
from a nationalist point of view, the Downing Street declaration had opened
up new opportunities. Most importantly, a ceasefire should be declared.
Mr Michael Nugent of the New Consensus movement, a long-time opponent of the
IRA and Sinn Fein, called for the party to 'test the bona fides' of the
joint declaration and for the IRA to declare 'a temporary and indefinite
ceasefire'. This, he said, 'would open up an entirely new situation'.
The Sinn Fein convener of the commission said: 'We are taking the
submissions very seriously indeed.'

The company declined to comment on reports that it was in talks with bankers
but a floating production platform would suit the conditions west of the

FT  07 FEB 94 / Warning on lack of young workers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Older workers will still be needed as the 'demographic time bomb' of a
shortage of young workers has not disappeared, says Mr Peter Warr, of
Sheffield University's psychology department.
He says in The Human Resource Management Journal that the recession has
hidden the decline in the number of people aged under 35 who will be in the
labour force over the next 12 years.

FT  07 FEB 94 / New state secondary school opened in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's first new state secondary school for more than a decade has been
officially opened by Tower Hamlets Borough Council, John Authers writes.
Swanlea School (above) cost Pounds 9.55m and was built on derelict land near
Whitechapel Road.
It will take 210 pupils each year, most of them from ethnic minorities -
particularly Bangladeshis and Somalis. School signs are written in both
English and Bengali.
Swanlea's radical architecture, which features a broad central mall with an
arched glass ceiling and an integral sports hall, is designed to help reduce
the borough's truancy problem.
The architects hope that children will prefer the school's environment to
the streets of Whitechapel.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Markets hit by devaluation and healthcare reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of drugs in Europe's seven most important markets collapsed 11.4 per
cent in dollar terms during the 11 months to November last year compared
with the same period in 1992. Healthcare reforms, combined with currency
devaluations, caused the steep drop from Dollars 47.1bn to Dollars 41.7bn
(Pounds 27.8bn).
In local currency terms, the European market generated zero growth,
according to IMS International, the market research group, against 10 per
cent during 1992.
The US market was also sluggish, up 5 per cent to Dollars 40.4bn,
demonstrating the impact of lower price rises and increasing purchasing
power of bulk purchasers.
Drugs sales in Japanese pharmacies increased 7 per cent in local currencies,
up from Dollars 14.8bn to Dollars 18.2bn. However, growth in the whole
Japanese market - including hospitals where most drugs are dispensed - was
slower.
European sales were held back by Germany, the region's largest market, and
Italy. Healthcare reforms in Germany introduced in January last year drove
the market down 9 per cent in local currencies, a fall from Dollars 13.4bn
to Dollars 11.5bn. The Italian market, which has also been shaken by a
series of reforms, plummeted from Dollars 10.1bn to Dollars 7.6bn, a drop of
3 per cent in lire.
Sales in France were down in dollar terms from Dollars 11.2bn to Dollars
10.9bn, but increased in francs by 5 per cent. Drugs sales in the UK also
dropped in dollar terms, from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 4.6bn, but increased 11
per cent in sterling. Sales in Spain fell from Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 4bn,
but in pesetas moved up 11 per cent. The Belgian market fell from Dollars
1.41bn to Dollars 1.39bn, but rose 5 per cent in local currency. In the
Netherlands, sales improved 12 per cent from Dollars 1.39bn to Dollars
1.47bn.
In Europe, cardiovascular medicines, the most important sector, declined 2
per cent in local currencies, from Dollars 10.6bn to Dollars 9.2bn.
Musculo-skeletal agents - primarily anti-arthritic products - fell 4 per
cent, from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.2bn. Alimentary and metabolism drugs,
mostly anti-ulcerants, reported no growth in local currencies as they
declined in dollar terms from Dollars 8bn to Dollars 7.1bn.
Some categories posted growth. Anti-infectives - antibiotics and anti-virals
 -were the fastest expanding therapeutic category, up 6 per cent, although
in dollar terms sales fell from Dollars 4.2bn to Dollars 3.9bn.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Chinese laws crack down on foreign missionary activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has tightened controls on foreign missionary activities and is seeking
to strengthen measures against unauthorised religious practices.
Publication at the weekend of two new decrees to improve religious
'management' is set to fuel criticism of China's human rights behaviour as
debate intensifies over renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading status
in the US.
The regulations, authorised by Premier Li Peng, took effect onpublication ,
and coincide with an explosion of religious activity in China. Titled
'Management of Foreign People's Religious Activities in China' and
'Management of the Place of Religious Activities', the new laws come less
than a week after a US State Department report said China's human rights
behaviour fell far short of internationally-acceptable standards.
Under the decrees, foreigners are banned from setting up religious
organisations, schools or offices in China. They were also expressly
forbidden from 'cultivating religious disciples among Chinese citizens and
appointing religious clergy'.
The rules follow the widespread growth of religious activity and increased
contacts with foreign religious organisations.
Attempts to stop 'unofficial' religious activity, especially proselytising
by foreign missionaries, coincides with a heightened campaign by western
religious organisations aimed at influencing President Bill Clinton's
decision on MFN - the lower-tariff regime which facilitates the sale of
billions of dollars worth of Chinese textiles in America.
An American-based organisation called 'Free the Fathers' urged the US
administration at the weekend to withhold MFN status following what it
claimed was recent persecution of priests who have maintained their
allegiance to the Vatican.
China seeks to exercise control over various religious denominations through
nationwide organisations, including the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association. Beijing remains estranged from the Vatican, although there have
been signs of a thaw.
Amnesty International added its voice at the weekend to calls for an end to
religious persecution. It complained particularly about the sentencing
recently of 11 Tibetan nuns to between two and seven years' jail for
allegedly taking part in an anti-Chinese demonstration.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Arafat-Peres Cairo meeting in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, was yesterday considering
whether to go ahead with today's planned meeting in Cairo between his
foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman.
Mr Rabin and Mr Peres have denied they are at loggerheads over the
negotiations, but Mr Peres' aides have leaked reports that the foreign
minister is frustrated at the army's intervention in the negotiating
process. Mr Peres was due to meet Mr Rabin last night to decide the strategy
for the Cairo talks.
If Mr Peres goes to Cairo today, political experts say he will have Mr
Rabin's mandate to settle an agreement at least on the remaining security
issues and therefore ensure Mr Arafat's participation. Mr Arafat has said he
would not attend the Cairo talks unless there were prospects for the signing
of a long-delayed agreement providing for the implementation of Palestinian
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
Negotiations with the PLO are at a delicate stage. A draft agreement reached
between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat in Switzerland last weekend has raised
objections from the Israeli army. Senior officers have insisted Israel must
maintain absolute control of security at the border crossings between Egypt
and Gaza and between Jordan and Jericho. They also want total control over
lateral roads leading to the Jewish settlements in Gaza and over the safe
passages granted to the Palestinians.
Some cabinet ministers, including Ms Ora Namir, the welfare minister,
yesterday criticised the influence of the army on the peace process.
Mr Rabin recently said there was no hurry in reaching a final agreement and
he would only be ready to sign once all issues were resolved.
Mr Haim Ramon, the politician most favoured by Israelis to succeed Mr
Yitzhak Rabin as Labour prime minister, yesterday resigned from the cabinet
over a row about health insurance policy.
The resignation means Mr Rabin carries responsibility as prime minister,
defence minister and acting minister of health, the interior and religious
affairs. He will have to find a way of keeping Mr Ramon, a spokesman of the
reform wing of the Labour party, in the government.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Japanese drugs groups to hear price cut details today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs groups in Japan will today learn how much the government intends to
cut pharmaceutical prices. The companies expect reductions to average 6.5-7
per cent, further undermining growth of a sluggish Japanese medicines
market.
The industry fears the Japanese market, the world's second largest, could
fail to grow over the next few years following the latest price cuts and
other government-inspired efforts to limit demand for medicines.
Mr Toshihide Yoda, drugs analyst at UBS Securities, estimates the market
will fall 0.9 per cent this year. 'There is no growth potential in the
Japanese market for the rest of the century,' he warns. Japanese companies
will be hit particularly because of their dependence on the domestic market.
Only three Japanese companies generate more than 10 per cent of their sales
overseas.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare is also expected to tell manufacturers
that in addition to the regular biennial price reductions, there will be
special price cuts for fast-selling products such as cholesterol-lowering
drugs and interferons.
One pharmaceuticals group believes the special cuts for cholesterol
medicines could be about 12 per cent, while the interferon prices could be
cut by 13-20 per cent.
After the ministry tells the drugs companies of the scale of the cuts, they
will be able to appeal. Prices for the next two years will be announced
around March 10, and implemented on April 1.
The price cuts will probably hit Sankyo, Japan's second largest drugs group,
hardest. The price of its cholesterol medicine Mevalotin will be reduced.
Last year, the product generated sales of Y86bn (Pounds 515m), representing
about 21 per cent of Sankyo's turnover, according to brokers Merrill Lynch.
Banyu, the subsidiary of the US group Merck, will also lose sales when the
price of Lipovas, its cholesterol drug, is cut. The compound was one of the
group's fastest-growing products last year, generating sales of about
Y16.6bn, compared with group turnover of Y122bn.
Among interferon manufacturers, Sumitomo Pharmaceutical is likely to be
worst affected. Sumiferon, its compound for hepatitis C licensed from
Wellcome of the UK, controls 40 per cent of the market, with sales of about
Y50bn.

Germany
Reflecting on BMW's surprise takeover of Rover last week, even Bild, the
raucous popular daily, appeared choked by some of the noxious anti-German
gas generated in the British tabloid press.
After crowing that the Brits were 'pissed off' in Tuesday's paper, by
Wednesday it was mourning the persistence of old resentments and weary
propaganda. 'The Germans are coming,' wrote leader writer Peter Boenisch.
But, he asked, was the arrival of BMW instead of bombs and rockets something
to be afraid of? No, it was marvellous. 'Democratic Germany is saying
'hello' and not 'Sieg Heil'.'
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung suggested that relatively few Britons
were angry that the 'bloody Germans' had bought Rover. It appeared to take
the view that underneath any resentment lay a feeling that the high
reputation of German industry and products was more important.
The stock market's Borsen-Zeitung took a similar view. Rover would benefit
from BMW's good name. On the other hand Rover customers would become more
demanding and no longer accept 'weaknesses' in their cars which they had
tolerated in the past.
This would require heavy investment it added. Reflecting similar concerns
aired in other commercially-angled analyses, the Borsen-Zeitung said a
question mark remained over Mr Pischetsrieder's calculation that two and two
made five.
Wirtschafts Woche, the business weekly, dwelt on recent failures in motor
industry mergers, citing the Renault-Volvo case and Volkswagen's disasters
with Seat in Spain. But it also made the point that Rover had more rich and
famous customers for its Range-Rover models than BMW had for the whole of
its 7-Series range.
Ukraine
The victory of a pro-Russia separatist in Crimea's presidential elections
last week overshadowed the long running debate on nuclear disarmament in the
Ukrainian press.
Kievsky Vedomosti, Ukraine's leading newspaper, viewed the election result
as a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity, saying the Crimean
president's 'mandate of popular confidence' - practically unanimous (73 per
cent of the vote) - is a substantial 'trump card in launching a political
game with Kiev'. The paper offered presidents of Crimea and Ukraine a prayer
in resolving the standoff: 'God help them]'
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's reaction to Crimea was notable by its
absence. Ukraine's opposition daily, Nezavisimost (The Independent), joked
about their president's notorious silence at critical moments: 'God reveals
to Clinton, Yeltsin and Kravchuk that the world will end in 24 hours.
Clinton summons journalists and tells his chosen people' to play the anthem
and raise the flag. Yeltsin organises a demonstration and orders his people
to drink and eat. Kravchuk. . . is silent. Finally, people run to him and
scream, we've all heard it on the radio. What should we do?' He answers,
'Relax, relax. . . We'll gather the government and discuss the issue
according to its scheduled order.'
The opposition daily was bursting with criticism from politicians who
believed Mr Kravchuk should have 'annulled the elections' in Crimea.
Instead, 'a conflict is coming to a head,' it warned, adding that 'it will
be difficult to spare Crimeans from the civil war' which has already spread
to other regions of the former Soviet Union.
All the newspapers took pains to explain that Ukraine's economic collapse
was the most important factor in the separatist vote. Only two years ago,
noted the government's mouthpiece Uryadovy Kuryer, the Russian-dominated
Black Sea peninsula voted to be a part of an independent Ukraine.
France
The growing tendency of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to buy his way out
of trouble - first with the farmers, then Air France strikers and state
schools supporters, and now the fishermen - has up to now caused him little
trouble.
The French public, which values social peace, still rates him highly in the
opinion polls. The left-wing opposition has not made the connection that it
is the privatisation of state companies which is bankrolling Mr Balladur's
largesse. But the failure of two aid plans to defuse a fishermen's protest
in Rennes on Friday that turned into a near-riot and the partial burning
down of the Breton parliament, has led the conservative press to question,
just a little, Mr Balladur's tactics.
Yesterday's Journal de Dimanche said, 'Our governments are encouraging
subversion' by handing out money to the fishermen the moment their protests
turn violent, though the paper noted that the previous Socialist government
had similarly caved in a year ago.
Saturday's edition of Le Figaro commented on the ritual that takes place
after violent demonstrations in France. 'Everyone first unites in condemning
the aggressive protesters. . . and then all conclude that their demands are
justified and their anger comprehensible.' The editorial deplored the fact
that 'today in France one has to turn on one's 'angry lights' to get a
hearing from the politicians'.
However, the Bordeaux-based Ouest France solidly endorsed the fishermen's
claims, saying on the morning of the Rennes riot that 'courage and
sang-froid' could be expected of them. Courage, yes. Sang froid, hardly.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Israel backs 'open skies' policy to encourage tourism:
Charter flight rules liberalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel yesterday approved an 'open skies' policy liberalising the country's
aviation regulations to promote competition and boost tourism.
The new policy, which will come into effect on March 1, will encourage
competition on fares, give airlines greater freedom to decide the number of
flights to Israel, and promote flexibility of charter flights.
The reform cancels the obligation for El Al, the state airline, to have an
equal number of flights with foreign airlines on a given route and allows
international airlines to increase flights to Israel. It gives travel agents
freedom to give discounts on tickets and cancels the Dollars 25 (Pounds
16.60) commission on ticket purchases. The policy provides for an increase
in charter flights, allows charter companies to carry Israelis as well as
tourists and makes licences for peak seasons more flexible.
Mr Uzi Baram, the minister of tourism, said the new policy would increase
the number of tourists to Israel, which last year reached 2m. He said the
policy was 'significant but not optimal'. The reforms, he said, should have
been approved six months ago but met objections from El Al until the
government agreed to continue paying the state airline 80 per cent of the
high costs of its security operations.
El Al yesterday welcomed the reform and said: 'El Al feels its efficient
operations will allow it to compete on the basis of price and improved
service.' El Al is expected to report 1993 profits of Dollars 10m, against
the trend in a globally depressed airline industry.
The Israeli Ministry of Energy yesterday said it had chosen Sofregas of
France to undertake a detailed study on the options of importing natural gas
into Israel. The state says it needs at least 3m tonnes of oil equivalent by
1996/97 to convert its power plants to gas and is considering at least four
possible gas deals with foreign countries and companies, including Qatar and

FT  07 FEB 94 / Compromise near on Tokyo tax cut plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday appeared near to a compromise on a
long-delayed economic package of tax cuts and government spending.
Party leaders agreed that the package, originally planned to be worth
Y5,100bn (Pounds 30.5bn), must be adopted as government policy before
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, meets US President Bill Clinton in
Washington on Friday.
The government is eager to present Mr Clinton with evidence that it is doing
its best to stimulate domestic demand, in order to deflect US demands for
numerical targets for a decline in the current account surplus and for
increases in the market shares of imported goods. Official figures today are
expected to show that the current account surplus rose to around Dollars
140bn (Pounds 93bn) last year from Dollars 117.55bn in 1992.
Japan wants to show it means to sweep away economically stifling regulations
and barriers to foreign competition, but cannot accept numerical targets,
officials say. Mr Hosokawa would lose as much support for agreeing to US
targets as he would by failing to produce an economic package, they argue.
Coalition members have been trying to hammer out a compromise on the
economic package since early Thursday morning when Mr Hosokawa dropped a
political bombshell by proposing a Y6,000bn-a-year tax cut, to be funded by
a 7 per cent 'welfare tax' on goods and services to be introduced in three
years.
The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, elected on a
promise not to increase the current 3 per cent sales tax, complained that Mr
Hosokawa had failed to consult the party - a clash with the Japanese
political tradition of consensus on difficult decisions.
The final shape of the compromise was unclear yesterday, but Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, Socialist leader, said his party had suggested the government
should wait two years before considering raising sales tax. 'We will discuss
the overall revenue situation and a basic welfare programme during that
period. This will help the prime minister achieve national consensus,' said
Mr Murayama.
That idea is likely to please the US, since it removes a damper on consumer
spending. But the powerful Finance Ministry and the Japan Renewal party -
the main influence on government economic policy - believe that a drop in
income tax must not be allowed to add to government borrowings.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Berlusconi sets out his claim to leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, yesterday staked his claim to the
Italian leadership before a crowd of 2,000 supporters gathered in Rome for
the first convention of his movement, Forza Italia (Come On Italy]).
His message was simple. He represented the sole new face in politics.
Italy's fortunes would revive within five years with him running the
country. Italians would enjoy a 'new miracle'.
For Mr Berlusconi, the enemy to beat in the March elections is the left, led
by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Defeating the
left was the best guarantee of basic freedoms.
His values, he said, were based on the family and rooted in liberal
democracy. Italy needed a state that worked for the citizen and encouraged,
not penalised, the entrepreneur. He pledged to cut taxes, saying it was
possible to reduce fiscal pressure by 1 percentage point a year.
Forza Italia's 40-point programme was the most detailed ever prepared by an
Italian party to fight a general election, he claimed. It would be released
on February 25.
Having decided to leave his Fininvest business empire for politics only two
weeks ago, Mr Berlusconi seemed still overawed by his new role. As he stood
on the podium backed by giant screen image projection and loud music, the
overall impression was of a slick promotional package that dominated the
man.
His style of speaking lacked the rhetoric and toughness of a politician or
the timing of a public speaker. His performance was a mix between those of a
company chairman talking to shareholders and a chat-show host searching for
the invisible public beyond the studio audience.
Mr Berlusconi was careful to pay tribute to the populist Northern League for
its historic role in breaking the mould of Italian politics. This olive
branch signalled that an alliance of the two was close. Suggestions of such
a link brought loud applause from the Forza Italia delegates. So did the
hints of linking with the neo-fascists.
A selection of Forza Italia parliamentary candidates was brought on stage -
businessmen, farmers, the wife of a professional footballer, and a Milan
magistrate who had been involved in anti-corruption investigations. All had
the same clean, scrubbed look as Mr Berlusconi.
The delegates and supporters, double the number expected by the organisers,
were also briefed by the movement's pollster, who produced statistics
demonstrating the strength of Italians' faith in Mr Berlusconi.
There were almost 300 spots on Berlusconi television channels during January
15-28, the time when he announced his decision to enter politics. The
marketing of Mr Berlusconi has begun.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a senior United Nations diplomat, last night clinched
victory in Finland's presidential election, rebuffing a powerful but
ultimately inadequate challenge from Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defence
minister.
Mr Ahtisaari, the candidate of the opposition Social Democratic party, won
53.9 per cent of the vote against 46.1 per cent for Mrs Rehn.
On a turnout of 82.3 per cent Mr Ahtisaari won by a margin of a quarter of a
million votes out of 3.2m cast. Mr Ahtisaari, 57, will succeed President
Mauno Koivisto, a fellow Social Democrat who has served two six-year terms,
next month.
His victory was predicted as long ago as last summer, but was thrown into
doubt three weeks ago when the right-of-centre Mrs Rehn, a member of
Finland's small Swedish-speaking minority, surged to a surprise second place
in a first round of voting and soon outstripped Mr Ahtisaari in the opinion
polls.
But Mr Ahtisaari clawed his way back with a tough attack on the government's
economic policies.
He also appears to have benefited from doubts among more conservative Finns
about voting for a Swedish-speaking woman.
Mr Ahtisaari made a call for greater government efforts to tackle
unemployment, which stands at around 20 per cent, his main election
platform.
Although the president has little power in domestic policy, Mr Ahtisaari has
said he intends to persuade the centre-right coalition of Prime Minister
Esko Aho to adopt more interventionist policies in order to speed an end to
three years of severe recession.
The main policy-making role of the president lies in foreign affairs, in
which the chief current issue is Finland's application - in parallel with
Austria, Norway and Sweden - to join the European Union. Mr Ahtisaari has
said he will actively seek a Yes vote in a referendum on membership due this
year.
He has supported EU membership mainly for the economic benefits he says it
will afford Finland.
He also favours neutral Finland's participation in the development of EU
foreign, security and defence policies following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, an important concern among Finns which has recently been given added
potency by the rise of Russian nationalist forces that have expressed the
view that Finland is a part of Moscow's domain.
A career diplomat, Mr Ahtisaari has worked mainly for the UN since 1977 when
he became commissioner for Namibia, eventually heading the successful UN
operation which oversaw Namibia's transition to independence in 1990. Since
then he has worked for the UN on former Yugoslavia.

FT  07 FEB 94 / EBRD to boost local presence: Staff build-up in east Europe
to bring services closer to potential customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development intends to increase its
staff in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by about half in an
attempt to bring its services closer to potential customers.
The move to raise by 20 the EBRD's expatriate and locally hired employees in
its 11 offices outside London forms part of a decentralisation strategy
being implemented by Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the EBRD president.
Mr de Larosiere believes the bank lacks the flexibility and on-the-ground
presence to respond quickly to emerging business opportunities, especially
with smaller enterprises.
As a result, the bank wants to recruit relatively young people with
experience of eastern Europe. 'We want people who can make deals,' one bank
official said.
The official added that the changes, which have been discussed with the
bank's directors and senior management in recent weeks, would take time to
implement. 'We cannot change direction in a few months.'
The decentralisation plan would be backed by a more effective system of
communication between the regional offices and the London headquarters.
The move is in line with the restructuring of EBRD's operations decided in
November to make the bank less bureaucratic.
Mr de Larosiere took over at the end of September after Mr Jacques Attali
was forced to resign following widespread criticism of the bank's
over-spending on its London office and relatively low disbursements of funds
for eastern Europe.
Since taking over, Mr de Larosiere has launched a programme to reduce costs
and refocus the bank's priorities.
During the second half of last year, the EBRD stepped up disbursements of
loans and equity to the former communist bloc. Some of these increased
pay-outs were already planned before Mr Attali left in July.
At end-December 1993, disbursements stood at Ecu556m (Pounds 414m), out of
approved projects of Ecu3.8bn and signed commitments of Ecu2.8bn. This
compares with disbursements of Ecu126m at the end of 1992 and Ecu244m last
June.
The EBRD's aim is to increase by five the bank's complement of around 20
London-hired employees in its outside offices. A further 15 will be added to
the tally of 20 local staff.
Seven of the offices are in former communist countries in central and
eastern Europe, with the biggest in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. The rest
are in Moscow and other parts of the ex-Soviet union.
The new posts will be offset by reductions in jobs at the EBRD's London
headquarters, in line with an overall freeze on hiring since Mr de
Larosiere's arrival.

France's Socialists, routed in a general election last March, won two
by-elections yesterday and made gains in a third, Reuter reports from Paris.
Socialist candidates took the Loire valley town of Blois and a Paris
working-class constituency in the second and final round of the
by-elections, with centre-right candidates trailing. In the Alpine town of
Digne, the centrist UDF candidate, Mr Francis Galizi, won 52.92 per cent of
the vote against Socialist Mr Francois Massot's 47.08 per cent.
The by-elections were ordered by the Constitutional Council, which ruled
that the holders of the three seats had spent more than FFr500,000 (Pounds
57,000) in the 1993 election campaign.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Crucial negotiations commence today on how to implement the international
climate change treaty to combat global warming, which comes into force on
March 21. Governments are rushing to put flesh on the bones of the framework
convention, signed by over 160 nations at the United Nations 'earth summit'
in Brazil in 1992.
The key issues at the two-week meeting in Geneva will be guidelines for the
preparation of national strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions and for
the funding of climate change projects in developing countries.
For the first time negotiators will also discuss whether to toughen the
convention by requiring industrialised countries to reduce emissions of
warming gases rather than simply to stabilise them. Under the present
treaty, developed nations aim to bring their greenhouse gas emissions back
to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The World Wide Fund for Nature on Friday called for governments to start
immediate negotiations on a cut of at least 20 per cent in carbon dioxide
emissions, ready for adoption when treaty members hold their first
conference in Berlin in March 1995.
Another longer-term issue concerns the scope for 'joint implementation',
which would permit rich countries to meet emission targets partially by
financing more cost-effective schemes in poor nations. Opponents contend
that this would allow the developed world to duck its prime responsibility
for causing global warming.
Some 55 nations, among them the US, the European Union and Japan, have so
far ratified the climate change convention. Industrialised country members
must submit information on national emission strategies by September 21. In
Geneva, negotiators will be trying to ensure comparable data by agreeing a
common methodology for countries to calculate gas emissions.

FT  07 FEB 94 / E European households seen as big market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of white goods in eastern Europe are likely to rise more than 50 per
cent by 1997, paced by strong growth in Hungary and Poland, according to a
report* by Euromonitor, the London-based market analysts.
Volume and value sales of white goods - cookers, refrigerators and freezers,
washing machines, dishwashers and ovens - will grow by 14 and 53 per cent
respectively by 1997, when Euromonitor estimates the market will be worth
about Dollars 6.2bn (Pounds 4.2bn), including partial data from Russia.
The projection implies that more sophisticated products will gain market
share, boosting the value of the market.
It underlines the importance of the east European white goods market to the
big western appliance groups, whose traditional markets are more mature.
Whirlpool, the world's biggest white goods producer, forecasts annual growth
of 6-8 per cent in the east European market, around double that for western
Europe.
Euromonitor says growth in Hungary and Poland will be fastest because they
moved towards a market economy relatively early, and consumers have more
money to spend on domestic appliances.
It says ownership levels in eastern Europe are high for refrigerators and
washing machines, while unfamiliar products such as dishwashers, microwave
ovens and driers are still taking time to establish themselves.
Washing machines, however, are likely to become the most important product
sector. They are less well established than refrigerators, giving scope for
sales to increase, and are a higher priority for consumers than dishwashers
or microwaves.
The report says there is plenty of scope for white goods companies to
establish manufacturing bases in the region, though in the short-to-medium
term it will be more feasible to establish a regional distribution network.

La Repubblica newspaper said the two airlines had signed a letter of intent
on co-operation on flights linking Rome and Milan with Newark and Houston.
La Repubblica, quoting US sources, said the deal was originally due to be
signed in the first half of February but it had been delayed until March 10
because of management changes at Alitalia.
Alitalia's parent, state industrial holding Iri, last week appointed two
former computer industry executives to head the debt-laden airline in a move
to stem huge losses.
Burdened by Dollars 1.17bn of debts, Alitalia is forecast to post 1993
losses of around Dollars 270m.

Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen won re-election at the weekend without opposition as

possible restiveness with his 22-year command of the party, by complaining
of 'clannish manoeuvrings' for posts on the party's 100-strong central
committee, writes David Buchan in Paris.
The tough line taken by the Balladur government, in particular its interior
minister, Mr Charles Pasqua, has tended to marginalise and silence the NF in
recent months. Demonstrators protesting in Paris on Saturday against recent
anti-immigration legislation carried a banner reading 'Pasqua copies Le
Pen'. However, a recent opinion poll showed 11 per cent support for the NF
in this June's Euro-elections, not far off its showing of 12.4 per cent in
last March's national parliamentary elections.

Mr Schrempp, whose company is a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, said Europeans
had to rid themselves of their dependency on the US in preparation for
longer term transatlantic co-operation.
'We don't have a two-way street with the Americans, meaning that there is
not a real technology transfer from the US to Europe,' he said.
'We still have the situation that if in defence we use American technology
we have to have their permission. This is not so much of a problem for
Germany but it is a big problem for Britain and France.'

<TEXT>
The Italian government has asked the EU Commission to retain the 1993
ceilings on Japanese car imports for the current year, writes Robert Graham
in Rome.
The move follows a disastrous year for car sales in Italy and the prospect
of only a modest recovery in the second half of 1994. Despite the
revaluation of the yen, the Fiat-dominated Italian car market is deeply
concerned by the potential of Japanese suppliers - either through direct
sales or via 'transplants' from Japanese factories within Europe.
The request was made last week in letters from Mr Paolo Baratta, Italian
trade minister, to Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for external economic
relations and Mr Martin Bangemann, commissioner responsible for industrial
policy.
For 1993 it was agreed that Japanese car sales should be limited to 4.5 per
cent of the total. This meant the Japanese could sell 38,000 vehicles, some
2,300 more than the previous year.

Bosnians wounded in a Sarajevo mortar attack that killed 68 people landed at
a US airbase in Germany last night for treatment in an American military
hospital, Reuter reports from Ramstein.
Military officials said about 150 people, both wounded civilians and family
members, were on the two US air force transporters and a Red Cross aircraft.
US officials said they had no immediate information on how many of the
evacuees were injured.
'They were very, very hungry. We had boxed lunch meals that we shared with
them,' an Air Force nurse said.
Another US nurse said most of the wounded on her flight were in stable
condition, aged between 25 and 30 and suffering from shrapnel wounds, broken
bones or amputations.
Nearly 200 people were wounded when a mortar bomb hit a crowded Sarajevo
open-air market on Saturday, the worst single massacre of the Bosnian war.
President Bill Clinton ordered the airlift.
Britain has also offered to take some casualties and has sent a medical team
to join another airlift this week of the mortar attack victims.
The Bosnian government declared a day of mourning, while families laid
flowers at the marketplace. Most of the damage had been cleared.
Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kreselvjakovic said: 'This was the worst day of death
in this city for 500 years.'
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, appealed to world leaders to help
save Moslems from 'slow-motion genocide'. He blamed Serb gunners for the
attack.
The Bosnian Serbs, denying responsibility for attacks on Friday and
Saturday, have accused the Moslems of massacring their own people to scupper
peace talks.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Russia warned to respect borders

<TEXT>
The US and Germany issued clear warnings to the new Russian government at
the weekend not to seek to create any 'spheres of influence or interest'
beyond its borders.
Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr William Perry, the new US
defence secretary, spelt out their deep concern at any moves by Moscow to
revive a nationalistic foreign policy in the former area of Soviet
influence. They also promised to do everything in their power to support
reform in Russia, including both economic reform, and integrating the
military.
Mr Perry revealed plans for the first joint US-Russian military exercise, to
be held by the US 3rd Infantry division, and the Russian 27th Motorised
Rifle Division, in the Volga region next July.
Both men were speaking at the annual Munich conference on security, where
the debate over the future of the Nato alliance was dominated by concern
over developments in the former Soviet Union.
Chancellor Kohl expressed confidence that President Boris Yeltsin 'will not
listen to those who call for Russia to adopt a nationalistic or even
imperialist policy'. The Russian leader had confirmed this in a letter in
the past few days, he said.
However he underlined his concern at recent Russian statements suggesting a
return to a nationalistic foreign policy. 'We all know that in Russia there
are deeply-rooted fears of encirclement and isolation, and not only in
military circles,' he said. 'Nato must take these fears seriously. . . if it
wants to create a wide-ranging security order for the whole of Europe.'
He said Nato's policy was aimed at 'a real and stable partnership'. He
added: 'In return, we expect Russia to continue a foreign policy marked by
constructive participation in solving international problems.' The Helsinki
Final Act called for 'unqualified respect for the sovereignty and integrity
of all nations' which 'must be adhered to unequivocally by Russia'.
He said: 'Above all, Russia must foster trust particularly among its
neighbours through its own action. Thoughts of creating spheres of influence
or interest would not be compatible with this.'
Mr Perry warned that Russia was undergoing an internal transformation which
'surpasses even that of the Russian revolution of 1917'.
It was natural for Russia to have an interest in the well-being of
Russian-speaking minorities in the former Soviet Union, he said. But he
warned: 'If Russian forces operate beyond Russia's borders, they must do so
in accord with international law. Russia's legitimate concerns with
stability on its borders must not be dealt with by relying on the old Soviet
practices of intimidation and domination, or by undermining the sovereignty
and independence of Russia's neighbours, whether their independence is old
or new.'
He urged Nato allies to act swiftly to put their plans for partnership with
members of the former Warsaw Pact into effect. 'If Russia hews to a course
of internal reform, respect for its neighbours' independence, and
co-operation with the west, Nato will continue to evolve in the direction of
maximum inclusiveness,' he concluded. 'If, however, reform in Russia
falters, Nato will be there to provide for the allies' collective defence.'

European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels today and tomorrow to
start the final stretch of negotiations aimed at bringing Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway into the Union by next January.
This is the main set-piece of a meeting that is expected also to include
consideration of a more robust stance on Bosnia.
For the enlargement deadline to be met, a deal on agricultural and regional
aid subsidies, plus the linked issue of how much the four applicants should
contribute to the EU budget, must be struck before the end of this month.
In addition, Austria wants greater environmental guarantees on EU truck
traffic through its Alpine passes, while Norway is still at odds with the 12
over management of its fisheries resources and Oslo's sanctioning of whale
and seal pup hunting.
The current Greek presidency of the EU has scheduled extra ministerial
meetings with the four for February 21-22 and February 24-28, in what still
looks like an ambitious attempt to conclude the enlargement talks.
'This is a serious attempt to finish the negotiations,' one senior EU
diplomat said, but 'it is perfectly possible that these negotiations will
not come to a conclusion in February.'
The 12, however, have at last endorsed the line taken by European Commission
negotiators on farm subsidies, broadly backing the Brussels approach to
regional aid for the four.
The Commission wants the generally much higher Nordic and Alpine subsidies
to agriculture realigned at EU levels immediately on entry, with the
difference paid as direct compensation to farmers.
All the candidates but Sweden, allied with traditionalists in the powerful
Commission agriculture directorate, prefer the border rebates that were used
to iron out farm subsidy differences until the internal market came into
effect last year.
Ministers are also set to take steps to strengthen relations with eastern
Europe.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Moscow set for tough battle over budget
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A draft of Russia's 1994 budget, aimed at bringing monthly inflation down to
less than 10 per cent by the end of the year, will be submitted to Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, today.
It is the first step in a difficult budget process during which the proposed
deficit is likely to be swollen by additional spending demands.
Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, said the projected budget
deficit was Rbs36,000bn or 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product. Revenues
for 1994 are projected at around Rbs114,000bn.
'This is a budget which would enable us to manage inflationary processes in
the country,' he said yesterday. 'But I am sceptical that the prime minister
will agree to such a budget and his decision is only a first stage.'
The budget next has to go to a cabinet meeting, and then to parliament for
approval.
The version which emerges from this process will provide the first real
indication of whether Mr Chernomyrdin can stick to the tough fiscal and
monetary policy he says he plans to complement with 'non-monetary methods'
to fight inflation.
In the absence of significant public sector borrowing, the budget deficit in
Russia is financed mostly by the printing of money which has been the main
source of double-digit monthly inflation rates.
An IMF mission in Moscow at the government's request has not been involved
in the preparation of the budget, as some Russian officials had wanted it to
be. 'They asked us to come to show that it is business as usual, but they
are not ready yet.'
The pressures for increased spending - regardless of its impact on inflation
 -are tremendous, while the political will to resist these pressures is
shakier than ever before.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, the reformist acting finance minister, has cut proposed
budget expenditure to Rbs150,000bn from the Rbs234,000bn sought by various
ministries. But his power to obtain the budget he wants is limited by the
lack of political support for fiscal discipline within the new government
and from the parliament.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Rise unlikely to hit flow of funds to emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first tightening of monetary conditions in the US in five years appears
unlikely to slow flows of funds to financial markets in Latin America and
Asia, according to economists on Wall Street.
These 'emerging' markets have been buoyed over the last year by heavy
capital flows from US mutual fund investors pursuing higher returns on
investment than those available in the US. But the quarter-point rise was
believed to be insufficient to affect these flows.
'There would have to be a move of considerably more than this to have any
significant effect on these markets. Even as much a 100 to 150 basis points
(1-1 1/2 percentage points) might not have a terrible impact,' said Mr John
Purcell of Salomon Brothers in New York.
Short-term rates of 3 1/4 per cent and long term rates of just over 6.3 per
cent did not appear enough to compete with recent returns on emerging market
investment. Latin American markets have been particularly strong this year;
the worst-performing, Mexico's, is up 8.5 per cent since the start of the
year, while Brazil's is up by some 40 per cent.

Codelco's report concluded that failure to implement controls had allowed Mr

FT  07 FEB 94 / Europe braced for nervous week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S financial markets are braced for a nervous start to the week after
the US Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy on Friday.
The Fed's quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates, resulting in
a stronger dollar, has prompted fears that European rates - on a downward
path - may not fall as far and as fast as hoped.
However, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said
yesterday that there was no reason why US rates should not go up while those
in Europe continued to decline.
'I don't think it will be catastrophic. Anyone who has been watching the US
closely should have known this was coming and it ought to have been
discounted in Europe,' he said.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the Fed's
move would put pressure on the D-Mark and create problems for Germany's
policy makers, where further interest rate cuts are widely seen as necessary
to stimulate growth.
'On the one hand there is still considerable economic malaise in Germany,
and they should be easing monetary policy,' he said. 'On the other, the
Bundesbank has always prided itself on currency stability.'
Mr Chertkow said it was possible that there would be a fundamental
reassessment of the D-Mark in the wake of the Fed's move.
Europe's government bond markets are also likely to have an uncertain week.
The Bundesbank's decision last Thursday to leave key German interest rates
unchanged had already disappointed the fixed-income markets and the US
decision prompted further price falls on Friday.
However, analysts yesterday pointed out that the reaction could have been
overdone. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers in London,
said the Fed's decision was better in the long term for UK government bonds
since it reduced the risk of inflation picking up in the US.

Washington's decision is a blow to the chances of Lord Lawson, who is backed

FT  07 FEB 94 / Clinton fires first shot in budget battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration will send its Dollars 1,500bn budget for 1995 to
Congress today, firing the opening shot in a tough battle to fit next year's
government spending inside the limits set last summer.
For the first time in more than two decades the budget will cut
discretionary spending, for which amounts are set in each year's budget,
below the Dollars 543bn of the current fiscal year, which runs to the end of
September.
But mandatory spending on entitlement programmes such as social security and
medical benefits for the elderly will continue to grow to absorb half of all
federal government spending, with interest payments on the national debt
accounting for almost 15 per cent more.
The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act agreed with Congress by former President
George Bush, coupled with the provisions of last year's five-year budget
law, have placed a 'hard freeze' on discretionary spending: the caps on such
spending will not be adjusted to take account of inflation.
The administration has also had to find additional spending cuts to pay for
the increased spending Mr Clinton has sought for favoured projects such as
job training, education and children's immunisation programmes.
The Clinton proposals would kill outright 115 distinct programmes, ranging
from lobster research and oilseed export subsidies to public library
construction and drug abuse grants, for total savings of Dollars 3.25bn.
The defence budget will contribute nearly half of these savings, cancelling
the last planned purchases of the H-60 helicopter and the F-16 fighter.
Other programmes to see funding cut severely include mass transit subsidies,
rural electrification grants and heating aid for poor families. Many of
these were listed for cuts last year but were saved by strong congressional
support.
Helped by low interest rates and the upturn in the US economy in the second
half of 1993, the federal budget deficit has dipped well below the levels
predicted last summer when Congress passed, by a single vote, the five-year
budget plan.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday the deficit would
drop to Dollars 171bn for the 1995 fiscal year and to Dollars 166bn the next
year.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Markets divided on Fed's next move: Why Wall Street
investors' rushed to sell on Friday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increase in US short-term interest rates on Friday marks the first
change of direction in US monetary policy in five years.
In itself, a quarter point increase in short-term rates, to 3 1/4 per cent,
should have a negligible impact on the economy. It is not enough to restrain
loan demand or to depress investment significantly. Given banks' fat
margins, it does not warrant an increase in prime lending rates, currently 6
per cent. And it is likely to have only a marginal impact on mortgage rates.
But because policy has changed direction, a strong market reaction - Friday
saw the biggest single-day fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in more
than two years - was not surprising. The impact was all the greater because
the tightening of policy occurred just after a sharp run-up in share prices,
when many investors were bracing themselves for a correction.
In Washington, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, won plaudits for
personally announcing the change of policy. He was aiming to counter
criticism on Capitol Hill of Fed secrecy and lack of accountability. A Fed
spokesman, however, was at pains to stress that Mr Greenspan's statement was
not a precedent and would not necessarily be repeated.
The Fed normally makes a statement only when it moves the discount rate,
which remains at 3 per cent. Financial markets are usually left to figure
out whether it has altered its target for the federal funds rate - the cost
of overnight money for banks - which rose a quarter point on Friday.
By speaking out, Mr Greenspan got 'more bang for his buck'. He enhanced the
impact of what was a very mild tightening of policy. But the downside of
candour was the stock market's negative reaction.
Since a single tightening move would be highly unusual, investors now have
to decide how rapidly and to what level the Fed will raise rates. Mr
Greenspan has a reputation for 'gradualism'. He believes monetary policy is
best conducted in small, measured steps. Since the risk of inflation surging
this year or next is slight, most economists believe rates will rise slowly
 -at most by about a quarter percentage point every three months.
'There will probably be no further action for several months,' said Mr
Leonard Santow, of the Wall Street firm, Griggs and Santow. He expects
another two tightening moves before the end of the year, taking the fed
funds rate to about 3 3/4 per cent.
But some forecasters fear the economy is gathering momentum so rapidly the
Fed will be forced to act more aggressively. Payroll employment figures
released on Friday were weaker than expected, but this reflected very cold
weather and the Los Angeles earthquake.
Other recent figures point unequivocally to rapid growth, perhaps at an
annual rate of 4 per cent this quarter and next. Buoyant data for factory
orders, for example, indicate further strong advances in business
investment. Residential housing soared in December. And there are early
signs of nascent inflationary pressure: the purchasing managers' price index
shot up last month.
Taking such data into account, Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon
Brothers, predicts the Fed will push up short-term rates to 4 per cent as
soon as mid-year. 'There will be plenty more moves this year and next:
markets are under-estimating the Fed's willingness to act,' he warns.
Action this aggressive would not please the White House. Ms Laura Tyson, who
chairs the Council of Economic Advisers, has indicated the administration's
budget forecast, due today, will allow for a half-point increase in short
rates this year. Senior administration officials believe anything more would
choke off the recovery.
As short-term rates rise, analysts expect a less-than-proportionate increase
in longer-term rates, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. This was
already evident last week when bond yields rose, but by less than short
rates. But if the Fed signals further tightening moves in coming months, it
could crush inflation expectations, causing yields on long bonds to decline
slightly.
Since most analysts expect only a modest rise in short rates, the US stock
market should be fairly resilient. Investors will still have a strong
incentive to hold stock and bond mutual funds, or other financial market
instruments, rather than low-yielding bank deposits. But investment is
driven by sentiment and since many analysts believed share prices were
overvalued before the Fed moved, a bigger correction than justified on
fundamentals cannot be ruled out.
The fact that the US has begun to raise rates while most other industrial
countries are still cutting theirs should boost the dollar in coming months.
Mr Lipsky at Salomon Brothers predicts that the dollar will climb nearly to
DM1.90 this year against DM1.76 on Friday. But this is at the top end of
Wall Street projections; many analysts fear the Fed's action will make the
Bundesbank even more reluctant to cut its rates, muting its impact on the
dollar.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Markets expect turbulent week: Share and bond outlook
uncertain after Fed move prompts Wall St slide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Share and bond prices face an uncertain outlook today with the world's
financial markets expecting a turbulent week. This follows Friday's steep
fall on Wall Street prompted by the Federal Reserve's decision to push up US
interest rates for the first time in five years.
The Fed's shift, which marks a distinct change in the investment climate,
caught the markets by surprise and prompted a 96-point plunge in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average as investors grew concerned that the increase might
end the bull run in stock markets in the US and elsewhere.
The decline was the largest one-day loss on Wall Street for more than two
years.
European financial markets were braced for turbulence amid fears that
further falls in European interest rates might be put on hold as the dollar
strengthened.
Analysts predicted that European equity markets would take their cue from
the sharp drop in US share prices, although most said they did not expect a
fall on the scale of the 1987 crash.
Trading was thin this morning on the Tokyo share market, with the Nikkei
average hovering above the 20,000 mark. By midday the Nikkei was down 262
points, or 1.3 per cent. 'It's a real wait-and-see market after the big drop
on Wall Street with foreigners doing very little,' one broker said.
In Hong Kong, where property and banking stocks were hit hard, the Hang Seng
index was down about 3.1 per cent in initial trading. The Singapore Straits
Times index was off nearly 2 per cent.
The Fed's modest tightening of monetary policy was viewed as an attempt to
forestall inflation by slowing the pace of economic expansion.
In the past three quarters the economy has grown at an average annual rate
of more than 4 per cent, which the central bank is likely to have viewed as
potentially inflationary.
Wall Street is braced for short-term falls in US share prices in the next
few weeks as investors use the Fed's rate increase as an opportunity to take
profits after the US market's strong run in January.
Mr David Shulman, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said Friday's large
drop in share prices was a 'normal reaction' to a Fed tightening, and
predicted fresh selling to come.
A temporary downturn in the stock market is regarded as particularly likely
if, as many on Wall Street expect, the Fed further tightens policy in the
next few months to ensure inflationary pressures do not build up.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities in Chicago, predicted
the Fed would put up short-term rates from 3 1/4 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent
or even 4 per cent, before the end of the year.
Yet most Wall Street analysts do not believe that the Fed's decision to
tighten monetary policy, by pushing the bank overnight lending rate up from
3 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent, will provoke a sustained sell-off.
Many said investors would ultimately see the rate rise as positive for stock
and bond markets, because it would show that the Fed was ready to combat the
threat of inflation while avoiding serious damage to the prospects for
economic growth in the US.
Economists at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street broking house,
have told clients: 'We do not expect a long-lasting effect on the stock
market, as the negative effect of tighter monetary policy will be offset by
the significant improvement taking place in the economy.'
The dollar opened slightly softer against the yen in Tokyo on profit-taking
at Y109.13 after its rise against both the D-Mark and the Japanese yen on
Friday.

FT  07 FEB 94 / BAe to confirm Cahill will quit as chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, BERNARD GRAY and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is expected to confirm early next week that Mr John
Cahill, its chairman for just 21 months, will leave the company in April.
It is thought that the company has prepared for Mr Cahill's departure as
executive chairman by seeking an outsider to become non-executive chairman.
The announcement has been delayed by negotiations over Mr Cahill's
compensation, which might be worth several million dollars. Mr Cahill
succeeded Sir Graham Day as chairman in April 1992 to serve a five-year term
on a salary of Dollars 800,000 (Pounds 533,300) a year, which for tax
reasons is paid in the US. He was also entitled to share options worth more
than Dollars 3m.
Pressure has been mounting on BAe to clarify the situation after speculation
that Mr Cahill would step down at the company's annual meeting in April.
Last night BAe would neither confirm nor deny the reports. However, it is
believed that BAe senior executives will meet this week to finalise details
of the succession.
Some BAe executives suggest tension had been mounting between Mr Cahill and
Mr Dick Evans, the group's chief executive. Mr Cahill, who was yesterday in
the US, where he lives, has been closely involved in BAe's unsuccessful
attempt to form a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace for its regional jet
business.
The agreement last week to sell Rover to BMW for Pounds 800m largely
completes the company restructuring Mr Cahill set out to achieve.
BMW's relationship with Honda, the Japanese manufacturer that owns 20 per
cent of Rover may be clarified this week. BMW expects that senior executives
will within days arrange meetings with Honda.
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the Honda president, said in an interview with the
Financial Times that the company was open to a wide variety of three-way
relationships as long as Rover did not lose its identity as a British
company.
But expanding his remarks on the BBC's The Money Programme yesterday, he
said: 'If it becomes only a joint venture with BMW, and Rover thereby ceases
to be a British company, our co-operative relationship with Rover will not
last long.'
A BMW executive said: 'We do not expect complications with Honda.' Honda was
expected to retain its 20 per cent stake.

FT  07 FEB 94 / New watchdog plans consumer panel to help protect investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority plans to set up a 'consumers' panel' to
advise it on proposals to strengthen investor protection and assess the
authority's effectiveness, according to a confidential draft of the body's
prospectus.
The PIA will also set up a committee to review the effect of regulation on
small financial services firms, in part to meet criticisms from independent
financial advisers that the PIA will introduce burdensome regulations. An
ombudsman scheme will help customers achieve redress in complaints against
PIA members.
The prospectus will determine whether the PIA obtains the support it needs
within the industry to become a credible self-regulatory organisation.
The creation of the PIA would mark the most significant development in
investor protection since the passage of the Financial Services Act in the
mid 1980s.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is expected
to announce this month that it intends to recognise the PIA as the
self-regulatory organisation covering retail financial services.
But to meet its goal of becoming operational in July by taking over from the
existing regulators, the PIA must win acceptance from enough of the industry
to see off the campaign from some large life insurers for a system of
statutory regulation.
The 30-page prospectus and a more detailed document setting out the PIA's
approach to regulation are to be published soon after the SIB announcement.
The draft seeks a balance between introducing further measures to raise
standards and giving the industry stability after a period of regulatory
uncertainty.
The decision that people working in the industry should not be in a majority
on the 19-strong PIA board has been the most recent cause of controversy
within the sector.
It led to the resignation from the board of Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing
director of Standard Life.
Independent financial advisers (IFAs), many of whom would be among the new
body's smaller members, have been among the PIA's most outspoken critics.
They may be reassured by the PIA's decision to put Mr Godfrey Jillings, the
chief executive of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for IFAs, in
charge of managing the process of admitting firms to the new regulator.
The PIA will have a cap of Pounds 100m for its liabilities to recompense
customers who cannot obtain redress because the firms that advised them have
gone into default.

FT  07 FEB 94 / West divided on air strikes against Serbs: France calls for
urgent Nato meeting to try to force lifting of Sarajevo siege
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western countries were united yesterday in their condemnation of the latest
Sarajevo shelling, in which 68 people were killed. But they were still a
long way from agreeing punitive air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
President Bill Clinton called for an emergency meeting to discuss the US
response to the outrage, at which all options including air strikes were to
be considered.
However, Mr William Perry, the new US defence secretary, who flew back to
Washington from Munich at short notice, emphasised that Washington would not
launch air strikes without close consultations with western allies, which
have 28,000 ground troops in Bosnia.
Mr Perry said a longer term view had to be taken on Bosnia. 'If air strikes
are act one of a new melodrama, what is act two? What is act three? What is
the conclusion?
'Any consideration of air strikes has to take into account that there are
28,000 peacekeepers on the ground, lightly armed, and not prepared to fight
a war, surrounded by 200,000 combatants who are armed and are prepared to
fight a war.'
As UN-brokered talks collapsed on a possible truce between the Serbs and
Moslems, Mr Clinton called on the United Nations to identify those
responsible for the shelling on Saturday.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, who would make the final
decision on air strikes, late last night asked Nato to obtain authorisation
to launch such attacks against artillery positions responsible for attacks
on Sarajevo citizens. Nato has previously authorised only air cover for UN
troops.
Mr Clinton directed Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, to
consult US allies on 'appropriate next steps'.
Mr Christopher said he did not rule out the use of air strikes against those
deemed responsible. UN experts have been unable to determine which of the
warring factions fired the 120mm mortar bomb into Sarajevo marketplace.
Among the European Union countries, whose foreign ministers are due to meet
in Brussels today, Germany and Belgium favoured asking the UN to give the
go-ahead to Nato air strikes. Britain and France called for an urgent Nato
ministerial meeting, which Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said
should serve an 'ultimatum' on Bosnia's warring parties to lift the siege of
Sarajevo. Nato officials indicated a meeting would be held tomorrow.
That ultimatum should insist that Bosnian Serb troops were pulled back far
enough 'to make the shelling of Sarajevo materially impossible', said Mr
Juppe.
In addition, it should specify that heavy arms belonging to both Serb and
Moslem forces deployed within 30km of Sarajevo should be gathered under UN
control. Failing this, air power must be used to enforce these decisions.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary said he remained cautious
about western military intervention. He said action should be taken only if
those on the spot believed it would help the three UN objectives: to stop
the fighting from spreading; to help politicians of all three communities to
negotiate a peace settlement; and to make sure that aid got through.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Paramount, the US communications group at the centre of a
Dollars 10bn takeover battle, yesterday urged shareholders to accept a bid
from cable TV company Viacom and to bring a speedy end to the five-month
battle.
Paramount warned that the long-drawn out bid risked damaging its business,
and asked shareholders to accept Viacom's offer by the bidding deadline of
February 14.
If neither Viacom nor rival bidder QVC gets a majority of the company's
shares by the deadline, Paramount said it would bring the bidding procedure
to a close. That could leave both bidders still struggling for control of
the group.
There is little to choose between the Viacom and QVC offers on price, though
Viacom's bid includes a slightly higher cash element and guarantees for
Paramount shareholders if Viacom shares fall in value over the next year.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN Security Council last night approved a new mandate for UN operations
in Somalia emphasising peace-making and reconstruction after a turbulent
year in which the world body's peace-keeping capability was severely tested.
With the US and several other national contingents due to pull out by the
end of March,the unanimous resolution scales down the UN force to a maximum
of 22,000 troops, still some 6,000 more than Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
secretary-general, proposed.
He has asked about 40 countries to provide soldiers but few have come
forward, given the risks in Somalia, where the UN has suffered substantial
casualties and many Somalis have died in clashes with the UN force.
The resolution reaffirms that the UN must complete its mission by March 1995
regardless of Mr Boutros Ghali's fears about a resurgence of factional
fighting accompanied by renewed famine.
The revised mandate lays stress on UN help for national reconciliation,
including the laying down of arms, protection of ports andairfields to
facilitate humanitarian aid and reconstruction, reorganisation of the police
and courts, and the repatriation of refugees.
Also, the UN would promote 'the ongoing political process' aimed at
establishing a democratic government in a country that has long lacked
central authority.

FT  05 FEB 94 / The Nature of Things: DNA, the case for the prosecution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our system of justice evolved at a time when people believed in absolute
values. It works through an adversarial process to discover the truth about
the defendant's guilt or innocence.
Science operates quite differently. For all its competitiveness, it is
essentially cooperative - and researchers are used to working with
probabilities rather than absolute truths.
The different processes and values of the two systems are now causing
unprecedented tensions between criminal justice and science. The immediate
issue is DNA profiling - perhaps the most powerful forensic technique
discovered this century.
Although everyone in the world has different genes (apart from identical
twins) it is not yet technically feasible to produce an identifying
print-out of an individual's genetic code. Instead, DNA profiling is a way
of showing up differences in particular genetic sequences that vary to an
extraordinary extent from one person to the next.
Sir Alec Jeffreys invented the technique in 1984 at Leicester University.
His laboratory procedure has 11 steps, including extracting DNA from a
forensic sample such as blood or semen, slicing it up with special enzymes,
separating the DNA fragments in an electric field and making them visible
with radioactive probes on X-ray film. The resulting 'DNA fingerprint' is a
pattern of bars or stripes reminiscent of a supermarket bar code.
Within a year DNA profiles were being used to prove family relationships in
paternity and immigration cases. The technique's first forensic triumph came
in 1986 when Leicestershire police used DNA fingerprints to track down Colin
Pitchfork, who had raped and murdered two 14-year-old girls.
Over the following three years, police forces in the US and UK took up DNA
profiling with enthusiasm and secured many convinctions with its help. But
by 1989 critics were raising doubts about its validity and reliability; in
several well publicised cases during the early 1990s, they convinced US
judges not to allow the prosecution to present DNA evidence.
Some of the early problems resulted from sloppiness and poor quality control
in commercial testing labs that had introduced DNA profiling too rapidly.
Most of those shortcomings have now been put right.
At the heart of the current tensions between forensic science and the law is
the way DNA evidence is presented in court. The point is that DNA profiling
is not an absolutely precise technique; it is an indirect visualisation of
genetic markers rather than a direct reading of genetic code. Even with a
perfect match between a suspect and an incriminating sample, the forensic
scientist can never be 100 per cent sure that this did not occur by chance.
The degree of certainty about the suspect's guilt depends on a variety of
technical factors, notably the amount of blood or semen available for
testing and its quality. Under favourable conditions the odds may be
billions to one on the match; with a tiny spot of dried blood, they may only
be thousands or hundreds to one.
The critics say that some over-enthusiastic forensic witnesses, egged on by
the prosecution, have overstepped their proper role as providers of DNA
evidence and have given what juries took as definitive statements of guilt.
There is now a vigorous debate between lawyers, geneticists and
statisticians about the correct basis for calculating probabilities of a
match between a forensic sample and a suspect - and how to present these in
court. In the US the National Academy of Sciences, which brought out an
influential report on DNA profiling in 1992, is under pressure from the FBI
to carry out a new study. In the UK the Court of Appeal has ordered the
re-trial of a convicted rapist because of the way DNA evidence was used in
his original trial.
Statisticians are concerned that courts have been confused over two quite
different probabilities. One is the chance that an innocent individual
selected at random would have a DNA profile matching the forensic sample. In
principle, an expert can estimate this from a technical knowledge of DNA
profiling and population genetics.
The second probability - the one that actually matters in court - is the
chance that the suspect is innocent even though his DNA matches the sample.
This is far harder to estimate because it depends on the circumstances of
the case and the number of other potential suspects who might have carried
out the crime. If there is no supporting evidence and the suspect was picked
out from a mass DNA screening programme, the risk of convicting someone
innocent will be far higher than the first probability would suggest.
To illustrate the two probabilities, imagine that a rape suspect is arrested
after genetic screening of 100,000 men in a particular city, simply because
his DNA profile matches the forensic sample. Then, if one man in a million
has this pattern - and no other evidence implicates the suspect - there is a
10 per cent chance that he is innocent.
Such calculations highlight the dangers of what some statisticians call the
'prosecutor's fallacy' - the suggestion that the first probability is the
same as the second. They also show how dangerous it is to convict someone on
the basis of DNA evidence alone.
DNA profiling is quite rightly becoming a routine tool of forensic science.
It is probably used in about 1,000 forensic investigations a year in the UK
 -to rule out innocent suspects as well as to convict the guilty. Most of
these cases never come to court but, when they do, it is vital that all
concerned should treat DNA evidence in a truly scientific way. In other
words, lawyers have to become more familiar with thinking about
probabilities rather than certainties.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Private View: Musical mystery man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Icons hung on the walls and a candle flickered on the mantelpiece. In the
corner stood the concert grand on which John Tavener composes his music.
This room in the Sussex countryside is a sanctum in every sense of the word.
Tavener was 50 last week and for his birthday he was given a four-day
festival of his work. For a modern composer of serious music whose spirit
dwells in the Byzantine Age he enjoys a remarkable - some might say
mysterious - popularity.
He even gets fan mail, from teenagers.
Two years ago a recording of The Protecting Veil, a cello piece dedicated to
the Mother of God, went to the top of the classical charts for several
months. ('Not one of my favourite pieces,' he says. 'In fact, I'm sick to
death of hearing it.')
I asked: Is your music the product of religious belief? Or the other way
round?
The composer paused and dreamily quoted a line of Yeats - 'the singing chant
of my soul' - before continuing: 'In a way they are inseparable, because
writing music to me becomes more and more, as I grow older, an act of
prayer.
'I don't think there is anything new about this. It seems to irritate some
people - certainly some critics - that they seem to have forgotten that in
almost every civilisation except the western this has always been the case.'
With hindsight, he said, the religious experience that prompted him to write
music was hearing Stravinky's Canticum Sacrum at the age of 12. 'I never
wrote music that was totally secular, even before my conversion to the
Orthodox church.'
Whether or not he is descended from his 16th century namesake, another
writer of sacred music, Tavener was precociously talented. He was barely in
his teens when he started to compose, and he studied to become a concert
pianist. As a youth he would entertain his aristocratic godmother and her
friends at parties by playing nursery rhymes in the style of any composer or
improvising a musical character sketch of somebody in the room.
Tavener's background is Scottish Presbyterian and, like his father before
him, he played the organ in a Presbyterian church. 'That made no spiritual
impact on me whatsoever, except, I suppose, a sentimental love of hymns
which I think I've just about lost.' As a student he flirted with Roman
Catholicism, but, repelled by its emphasis on punishment and hell, was
received into the Russian Orthodox church at the age of 33.
'I'm not a sort of crank who plays a bit with this and the other; but I read
books, particularly Ananda Cooramaswami who has far more penetrating things
to say about Christianity than most so-called Christian writers in the west
today. It doesn't surprise me that so few young people in the west have
little time for Christianity. It compromises so much with modernism.'
What do you mean by 'modernism'?
'For me modernism is anything that has no connection with tradition, has no
connection with symbolism, has no connection with metaphysics.' And
surprisingly, he added: 'It's basically what our future king advocates. I
think we are extremely lucky to have someone who feels as deeply as he
does.'
What would you say to being called a reactionary?
'I don't think it's a question of being reactionary. You see, tradition is
something that stems from God himself therefore you can't talk in terms of
being reactionary. A modernist would say I was reactionary. I can understand
that. But in that case I'm very glad to be a reactionary.' He laughed.
Pointing to a collection of records, he said he had listened to all the
moderns: Stockhausen, Berio, Ligeti, Boulez, but found it all 'totally
meaningless'. He prefers the music of Sufism, Byzantium or Russian chant
while continuing to venerate Bach. But he has a special weakness for
Mozart's Magic Flute.
For you music is primarily a religious medium?
'I think it's totally that.'
So when music came out of the churches and into the court that was the
beginning of the end?
He laughed. 'For me it started to go downhill'
You would have to say the same about painting, I said.
'Yes. I would. Possibly even more strongly.' He pointed to an icon.
But there would have been no Cezanne, no Monet . . .
'That wouldn't matter to me. On the other hand you can't say God only
operates in a middle eastern context. I realise I can't take this point of
view to an absurd stage. I particularly agree about the Impressionists. I
love them. They are much more like icons because they are not literal. Where
I stumble is with so-called religious art in the Renaissance, where you see
a fat woman with a fat baby. It doesn't inspire in me the same veneration
because it lacks the gnosis - another word we have lost.'
Music was God-inspired, but that did not make it easy. 'It's much tougher
than people think. One is brought up with the idea that music has got to be
complicated, got to be interesting, to follow an argument. It takes a vast
amount of thought to make music simpler, stripping it of complexity.'
Are other composers self-indulgent not to make music about God?
'It's not really for me to judge. Obviously their music falls, as far as I
am concerned, on deaf ears. That's all I can say.'
Talk of self-indulgence prompted me to ask whether behind the modest manner
and devotional writing there lurked a secret vanity.
Almost every page of the festival programme carried his photograph and I
recalled the moment when Tavener strode theatrically down the aisle of
Westminster Cathedral, coat draped nonchalantly over his shoulders and long
hair flowing, to take the applause for Ultimos Ritos.
Yes, the composer said, he had a personality problem - he found it hard to
say No, to photographers or anybody with a job to do. 'Have I the right to
say I won't be photographed? It's a kind of humility.'
And the hairstyle? 'I've always had it long. I'm losing it terribly on the
front and . . . It really isn't conscious.' Later, he said: 'There are
paradoxes in my life. I love old cars; I've had a succession of old
Bentleys. I don't think that's a bad part of me, just another part of me.'
It may, however, be an important fact about Tavener that his life is hostage
to serious hereditary heart trouble, related to a condition known as
Marfan's syndrome which affects the connective tissue of some tall people.
He is 6ft 5in and thin, with long, tapering fingers. Rachmaninov, he thinks,
was another sufferer. He has had major surgery, and tires easily. These
bouts of illness he takes as a divine signal. What did the signal mean?
'That giving into despair is the wrong idea and that I still had to keep
going.' A sign that you were paying for something?
'The fact it's taken me so long to be able to cope with the idea of
marriage,' he said. (Tavener's first marriage, to a Greek dancer, was
short-lived. In 1991 he married Maryanna Schaefer and they have a fat
five-month-old daughter, Theodora.)
'I think in this last illness when I came so close to death I realised that
the only way to live was to live at all risks, otherwise there is no point
in living at all.'
Did selfishness stop you?
'Yes. Absolute selfishness and the fact that it would interfere with my
precious work - that I couldn't have children because they'd make such a
noise. Now I have child, and thank God.'
Are you so prolific because of your illness?
'I'm much more aware of mortality, even though it seems ridiculous when one
thinks of it. Who really cares whether I write any more music or not? I
mean, in the light of eternity, is it so important? And yet it seems the
most important thing in the world. It must seem like that, otherwise what
the hell's the point of doing it?'
What would you like to do, say you have done, before it catches you . . .
'Before death,' he corrected. 'Um. Obviously, even though I have a wife and
a child, the most important thing for me still is music. So, it would be to
make music actually become meaningful, not in a way that Romantic music is
meaningful but in the way it was at the time of say, Plato, when the right
notes had to be found before parliament could be opened. So that music was
so sacred, so much part of life . . .
'Of course, I can't do it. Stockhausen believes he can do such a thing and
Scriabin thought he could bring the world to an end by inventing a certain
mathematical chord. There is a danger of going completely cuckoo.'
If you were to hold a cuckoo theory would it be that certain sounds,
combinations or pitches can reach certain parts of the human psyche?
'Of the human spirit, not psyche. That's right. I think you've got it.
Absolutely. It would be impossible, but that would be my cuckoo thought.
'Music has become so abstract and so unconnected with anything that at least
I have reinstated some of the sacred backing to art.'
To save music from total disintegration?
'That's what I really believe.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / As They Say in Europe: Taking a fight to the Finnish - The
importance of balls, scandal and cake in Austria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was only two weeks ago that I completed an exhaustive and, I thought,
scholarly, comparative study of attitudes towards sex scandals in Britain
and Germany. I hoped that I would not have to return to this unsavoury
topic, but the pressure of events in Austria has forced me to reconsider
matters.
My first inkling of trouble to come appeared in an article in the
conservative Vienna daily, Die Presse. On January 12 it published what
should have been a boring report on postings in the Austrian foreign
ministry. Buried in the item was this note: 'On account of the talk about
his contacts with Romanian prostitutes, the former People's Party deputy,
Herr Ettmayer, has been named ambassador in Helsinki.'
There was no further explanation, and no reaction to what some Finns might
have thought to be an insensitive move on the part of those who mastermind
Austrian diplomatic initiatives. The two countries have, after all, stood
shoulder to shoulder for three decades and are negotiating simultaneous
entry into the European Union.
My assumption that this story might reflect a relaxed attitude towards such
matters in Austria was not wholly borne out by subsequent events. For then
there was the revelation that President Klestil, 61, was conducting an
affair with his 39-year old assistant, Margot Loffler. In an interview in
News magazine, he admitted he and his wife had parted company.
That emerged only after lengthy questioning on such matters as Austria's
entry into the European Union, the state of broadcasting and so on. Then the
interviewer diffidently said: 'Mr Federal President, there is a story going
the rounds in Vienna that there is a problem in your private life. You have
always said you believe in speaking openly and that you want be honest with
the people. Are you ready to talk about your private life?'
President Klestil gave a crafty answer which, I thought, heralded evasions
common to politicians: 'I shall not flinch from your frank question. I'll
just state one thing first: a politician is also a human being.' But Klestil
admitted his wife had left the offical villa and gone to their old home.
By this time the interviewer realised he or she had stumbled on a
nation-shattering story, always troublesome for a journalist, and clearly
had no idea how to deal with it. After a while the questioning became
flustered: 'Why are you answering so frankly?'
'Because you asked the questions.'
There was a typically Viennese conclusion: 'Did your absence from the New
Year balls, with the exception of the opera ball, have anything to do with
your problem?' The reply was that there were too many balls and he, Klestil,
had decided months ago to attend none but the night at the opera.
The Neue Zurcher Zeitung is alone among outside commentators in recognising
the importance of such items as balls and scandal (and cake for that matter)
in Austrian public life. Under the attention-grabbing headline 'Shadows over
Klestil's presidency,' it reported that Mrs Klestil attended the more
prestigious philharmonic ball where she was greeted with a 'prolonged
ovation.'
That was after Mrs K had disclosed that Ms Loffler was the Other Woman,
which caused the tabloids to explode. 'Sue or quit,' Kronenzeitung told the
president. Not only was the mistress on the presidential staff, she was also
a career diplomat and had requested a posting abroad. 'Send her to Finland,'
wrote a columnist in the paper which rather charmingly translates as Daily
Everything.
There were any number of issues which served to inflame feeling. The
president had to make a UN conference speech on family values, sponsored by
the Vatican. There he pointed out that his experience had heightened his own
awareness of such questions. Then, having said he was giving up his wife and
his mistress, it was announced that Loffler was to accompany Klestil on next
week's official visit to Egypt.
'She belongs to the president's team and she organised the Egypt trip,'
explained the president's office. But that resolution did not last long. On
Wednesday officials said she would leave the presidency and 'take a long
holiday.'
Curiously, that marked the anniversary of another Viennese tale of
starcrossed lovers. Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the imperial throne, and
his mistress, Maria Vetsera, were found dead at the hunting lodge at
Mayerling 105 years ago.
It was supposed to have been suicide but the Habsburgs offered little
evidence. It is a strange thought that that tragedy could have been averted
had Finland gained its independence a generation earlier.

FT  05 FEB 94 / BMW runs over Heseltine's testament: What has become of the
squire of Thenford's views on the motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1989, I travelled to the border of Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire, to
visit the squire of Thenford. This handsome man in an even more handsome
Palladian house was, not so surreptitiously, mounting a challenge to the
leadership of Mrs (as she then was) Margaret Thatcher. I had come to
interview Mr (as he still, temporarily, is) Michael Heseltine.
Naturally I made it my business to read the book described as Heseltine's
'personal testament', Where there's a Will. Written in 1987, it set out to
defend the author's distinctly unThatcherite views on the running of the
economy, particularly in a chapter entitled 'Industry: a strategy.' There
the 'president of the Board of Trade' set out a list of those industries
which required the special attention of government, foremost among them the
British motor car industry.
Heseltine opined that no modern industrial economy worth the name could do
without a home-owned car industry, and said, inter alia:'For the major part
of the British motor industry to fall entirely into foreign hands would
leave it a hostage to decisions in Detroit, Paris, Turin . . . that is why
the future of the sole-remaining British-owned and British controlled motor
manufacturer, Rover, will continue to be a matter for the Government.
Otherwise the British motor industry will find itself further down the
cul-de-sac to extinction.'
This seemed to me at the time, and still does, to be an archaic analysis of
the modern industrial economy.
What about Texas? The Texans seemed to get on just fine without making a
single car, I suggested to Heseltine, in 1989, as we gazed out over his
estate from his stupendous drawing room.
Not really a country, he said.
What about Switzerland? I asked.
Not a major industrial power, said Heseltine.
He was immovable on this point. So I am afraid I laughed out loud, when I
heard the announcement, hot off the Bavarian presses, last Monday morning,
that British Aerospace had sold its 80 per cent stake in Rover to BMW for
Pounds 800m, with no objections from the president of the Board of Trade.
I laughed because I was trying to imagine the discomfiture of Heseltine when
his opposite number, Robin Cook, stood up in the House of Commons to quote
back at the president of the B of T his own 'personal testament' of undying
support for the home-owned British car industry.
Unfortunately for the Labour Party their front benchers missed this
opportunity, as they have missed so many others in recent months. The press
too - which a few years back had mounted a successful campaign against the
government's plans to sell Range Rover to General Motors, provoking a rare
climb down by Thatcher - was generally acquiescent in the transmutation of
Rover into Britische Motoren Werke.
Of course, we are all quite right to be so grown-up. We British have been
beneficiaries of the anti-protectionist trend, picking up valuable assets
all over the world. In general, it makes sense that companies end up in the
hands of those who will manage them best: no one can seriously claim that
BMW will run Rover worse than the somewhat opportunist management of BAe.
Yet, I cannot have been the only free trader who was more than faintly
irritated by the spurious claim - since retracted - of the chairman of BMW,
Bernd Pischetsrieder, to be the nephew of Sir Alec Issigonis, the designer
of the Mini.
Nor I imagine, am I the only believer in the free market who was irked by
the triumphalism of the German press over the takeover of Rover. 'The Mini
is now German' proclaimed the Bild Zeitung, over a photo-montage of Rover
Cars bearing the BMW logo. Another German newspaper published a cartoon of
Big Ben, with the BMW blue and white emblem in place of the clock face. All
harmless of course, but somehow, as I read of these outbursts of German
chauvinism, something like the following crossed my mind: 'You are laughing
now, Fritz, but I don't think that Daimler-Benz is in such great shape. And
have you heard of a company called Hanson ?'
Go on James, give us all a thrill, and make Michael Heseltine's day.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: An orgy of nostalgia - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an art form still just short of a hundred - centenary fireworks next
year - movies have an amazing reverence for the past. They keep that past
alive now thanks to their life-extending nephew, the video market, whose
release titles this month read like an invitation to a nostalgia orgy.
Here is a new label called 'Golden Age' wheeling out gilded classics like
Griffith's Intolerance, Stroheim's Queen Kelly and Murnau's Faust. The late
Federico Fellini is honoured with two choice reissues of early films,
Variety Lights and The White Sheikh (Connoisseur). And then there are the
new Hollywood movies, like Abel Ferrara's Body Snatchers (Warner) and Joe
Dante's Matinee (Guild), whose sole purpose is to remake old Hollywood
movies or genuflect before them.
Dante's film has a whale of a time throwing a larger-than-life horror
director played by John Goodman (and based on William 'The Tingler' Castle)
into Key West during the true-life trauma of the Cuban Invasion. And Ferrara
gives the twice-filmed Invasion Of The Body Snatchers a fresh
fear-transfusion by setting it in an army camp. The 'pod' people wear khaki;
the innocent newcomers are an army wife (Meg Tilly) and her children; and
the clue to the newly 'possessed' is their tendency to emit
eardrum-skewering screams whenever they sight a potential victim.
Unreleased, bizarrely, in UK cinemas; worth catching now.
As for the lovingly reissued classics, you should pounce on three. Variety
Lights (1951) was Fellini's dazzling solo-directing debut, spinning wit and
visual poetry around his wife Giulietta Masina. Queen Kelly (1929) has
Gloria Swanson alternating piety with pulchritude as a convent girl raised
to royalty. (Loopy plot; lyric treatment). And Intolerance (1916) is still
the epic to end them all. Its Babylonian temples, horizon-to-horizon battle
scenes and multiple-choice narrative (Nebuchadnezzar, Crucifixion, St
Bartholomew's Day, modern love story) still amaze, even when squashed into a
TV screen.
That both Stroheim's and Griffith's films became raw material for later
movies - Swanson re-runs Queen Kelly in Sunset Boulevard, Intolerance
inspired the Tavianis' Good Morning Babylon - adds to our sense of cinema as
a Chinese box of nostalgic self-referentialism. For past-delving good
measure February also offers the original 1925 version of the thrice-filmed
The Lost World (Golden Age) and Clouzot's first, French and finest Wages Of
Fear (Arrow); made in 1953, 20 years before the excruciating Hollywood
version directed by William Friedkin.
But movies can also do more inventive things with Time than trawl through
golden ages for inspiration-prompts. My pick of the month is the Bill Murray
comedy Ground-hog Day (Columbia). Here an art form based on pictures moving
through time gets stuck in time as if in a revolving door. Murray is a TV
weathercaster weekending in the tiny town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, for
the annual spring-heralding Groundhog Festival. But each morning, he wakes
up to find that it is the same day: same people saying and doing the same
things, except for Murray himself who finds he can use his cumulative
hindsight to influence destiny - and the affections of his beloved Andie
McDowell.
No medium but the moving picture could make this work. What would seem
laboured whimsy in a novel or stage play is funny because of cinema's
throwaway realism and Murray's own throwaway, cinegenic befuddlement. This
actor is modern cinema's best disgruntled comic - his face a living beanbag
 -and in Groundhog Day he has the time of his life trying to sort out the
time(s) of his life.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Izzard, wizard at the game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an interesting new version of that 'Popular panel game, Just a
Minute' on offer at the Albery over the next seven weeks. There is only one
contestant, Eddie Izzard, who is given the usual random subjects like
'washing powders', or 'birds', or 'round tea bags' and must then witter on
about them with as much repetition, hesitancy and deviation as possible
until a silence falls upon the theatre.
Eddie is a wizard at the game. He keeps it up for over two hours. Of course
there is the odd dramatic mannerism to help things along. Izzard is a
semi-detached transvestite which on this showing means wearing thick make
up, including elongated red finger nails Joanna Lumley would kill for, and
black tights. He also has an agreeable personality, laid back, easy going,
quite at odds with the 'fingers in your eyeballs' delivery of other
contemporary stand ups like Ben Elton. If you have got to be stuck between
London and Edinburgh with an obsessional conversationalist you could do
worse than Izzard.
But charm is best oiled with good material and Izzard's is patchy. This does
not worry him. If a particular imaginative flurry does not attract a giggle
he says 'right enough' and crosses it out on his imaginary script.
Fortunately as 'Top Live Stand Up Comedian British Comedy Awards 1993'
Izzard has a reverential following and most of his musings constantly keep
enough of the audience in stitches.
I laughed fitfully. He is funny on the differences between dogs and cats -
do not expect to tramp the realms of the higher philosophy with Izzard - and
few men could talk for 20 minutes about washing powders with such
surrealistic effect. His ruminations about how blue pants manage to
infiltrate the white wash might make a compilation of the best of 1990s
humour some day.
But unless you are as caught up in the minutiae of Star Trek, leave 20
minutes before the end. You only have to say 'beam me up, Scottie' to crease
up a substantial section of the population, but this is a generational
weakness, a desire by thirtysomethings to return to their childhood and
laugh at the awfulness of a series they took so seriously. It is too soft a
target for so much of Izzard's time.
Better by far are his forays into wildlife. 'Bees making honey is like
earwigs making chutney,' he muses, and is strong on bird migration. His
willingness to swoop around the stage, with impressions of swallows,
astronauts and Dracula greatly beefs up the performance.
Izzard refuses to appear on television, although he is working on a sit com.
He is a rare, unusual talent, aimable, non political, quite decorous in his
language. He is quite important so a trip to the Albery is almost essential.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Visions to soothe the soul - Claude may have painted
to order, but Patricia Morison is enchanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Claude Lorrain died in 1682, his tombstone in Rome honoured 'the
outstanding painter, who represented marvellously the rays of the rising and
setting sun over the landscape.' Claude: The Poetic Landscape, the new
exhibition in the National Gallery's Sainsbury Wing, could not fail to be a
ravishing show, yet it takes a strangely oblique approach to 'the
outstanding painter'. It asks two questions, who are those quaint little
people in Claude's landscapes, and how much do they matter?
It might seem like footling pedantry to draw attention to Claude's Achilles
heel. Anyone can see that he was as bad at drawing people and cows as he
excelled in depicting sunlight, clouds, temples and bosky trees. As he grew
older, the classically robed figures with big chins and rubbery bodies grew
larger and, in his last years, even more peculiar.
In the Ashmolean Museum's 'Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of
Silvia', Ascanius looks like a stilt-walker and the stag has apparently
swallowed a whole baguette. Yet it is one of my favourite paintings, its
strangeness inseparable from its haunting atmosphere. To other admirers of
Claude, however, the beauty of his landscapes is inversely related to the
prominence of his people. Even so, they will find Claude; the Poetic
Landscape is a marvellous exhibition. Claude's vision of Arcadia is balm to
the soul, just as it was to the jaded, world-weary cardinals and princes of
his day.
The National Gallery's 12 Claudes, landscapes and scenes of classical
seaports, are shown with paintings and drawings from museums and private
collections all over Europe. Paintings hang beside related drawings. They
are wonderfully varied: atmospheric sketches from nature, ideas for
compositions, and exquisite finished drawings like the Queen's 'View of
Delphi With a Procession'. A number are from the British Museum's Liber
Veritatis, the book which Claude, who despite his success seems to have been
mildly paranoid, began to protect his compositions from fakers.
Yet the schoolmasterly hand is hard to ignore. One effect of Claude's
success was that richer men liked to buy his pictures in pairs so that they
could enjoy contrasts in views, moods and times of day - a kind of pictorial
equivalent of listening to Indian ragas. Some pairs split between different
collections are reunited here, but some are hung separately, according to
Claude's subject matter: the Bible, Ovid, Virgil, Apuleius and Tasso.
These were perfectly standard sources for painters. However, a subject like
'Bacchus at the Palace of Staphylus', taken from the 5th-century Greek poet
Nonnus, must have been the last word in intellectual chic. Claude, who
initially wanted to be a pastry cook, was not an intellectual, like Poussin
or Rubens. His stories must have been dictated by his patrons.
In the catalogue (light enough to carry round the show) curator Humphrey
Wine fleshes out his argument. Claude's clients were not just rich but
clever, alumni of the top Jesuit schools and aristocrats who believed the
blood of Virgil's heroes ran in their veins. To cater for their tastes, the
people we see in the first room, shepherds, peasants and prostitutes, were
replaced by figures in togas.
Erudite clients asked for such uncommon scenes as 'Perseus and the Origin of
Coral' from Holkham Hall and 'Landscape with Mercury and Battus' from
Chatsworth. Perhaps they competed to devise ingenious themes for their
poetic landscapes. For one papal courtier, Claude painted a classical port
thronged with St Ursula and her 11,0000 Virgins, tripping down to the
quayside armed with bows and arrows. For Cardinal Pamphili, Claude painted a
seaport with a subject never shown before, 'The Embarkation of the Queen of
Sheba', now in the National Gallery.
It was hardly accurate to show the queen going by ship, given that the Book
of Kings tells us she took a camel train to meet King Solomon. In Spain,
taking poetic license with the Bible could have meant trouble with the
Inquisition. Pamphili, however, was the pope's nephew and could call the
tune. Besides, Claude would have made a horrible job of the camels.
For the pendant, Pamphili wanted a golden afternoon and rustic merry-making.
'The Marriage of Jacob and Rebekah' shows a party in full swing, whereas
according to the Bible, Jacob simply took Sarah into his mother's tent and
got on with it. No one would even know what these two famous paintings
represent if Claude had not inscribed the titles in the pictures.
At least to his clients, the people in Claude's landscapes did matter.
However, you may feel that the poetry of his paintings starts to dispel the
more that is known about their origins. Take 'The Enchanted Castle',
properly known as 'Landscape with Psyche outside the Castle of Cupid'. Wine
suspects that Psyche's horrid fate was chosen by the philandering Prince
Colonna as a warning to his wife not question his escapades.
Is it not going too far, to see the origin of one of the best loved and most
sublimely mysterious pictures in the National Gallery, source for Keats's
'Ode to a Nightingale', as a squalid philanderer's charter? Even worse is a
recent, horridly topical, view of the brief given by the prince to Claude.
'The Enchanted Castle' was to illustrate the lines in Apuleius's poem in
which Psyche considers whether to decapitate her lover Cupid that night as
he slept.
This is an exhibition which is sure to divide romantics and hard-heads. But
to my mind, we can never know too much about the genesis of great paintings.
The poetry and magic of Claude survives; as a contemporary wrote, 'one sees
things from his hand which, surpassing all imagination, can by no means be
described.'
Exhibition continues until April 10; open until 8 on Wednesdays. Director's
Evenings will be held on March 8 and 22; to book, ring 071-389-1771.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Tables set for a king - Susan Moore sits down to dine
at Versailles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At dinner the young Louis XIV had some 154lbs of gold plate at his disposal,
yet he ate with his fingers and rented his napkins. Increasing research into
the use of the decorative arts in historic houses and palaces has led to new
interest in the art and ritual of dining.
The catalyst was the restoration of Het Loo in Holland in the late 1980s.
Henry VIII's kitchen has been recreated at Hampton Court and William III's
private dining room opened to the public last year. There were elaborate
exercises in historic table laying at Amalienberg in Copenhagen and at
Kensington Palace in London, where a display of Danish royal silver was set
as for Christian V11's 21st birthday banquet in 1770.
The latest and most ambitious manifestation of this table-mania is a
spectacular exhibition at Versailles. Versailles and the Royal Tables of
Europe presents a sequence of sumptuous displays of French gold and silver
plate and Sevres porcelain, supplemented by paintings, prints, table plans
and menus. Loans have come from museums and private collections from St
Petersburg to Lisbon.
The repatriation is all the more poignant because virtually no 17th or 18th
century plate survives in France. Louis XIV transformed dining at court into
a highly ritualised public display to demonstrate the wealth, status and
absolute power of the monarchy. What was not claimed by successive royal
smeltings to finance war was dispersed in the Revolutionary sales, as were
the royal Sevres services.
The greatest testament to the art of the 18th century French goldsmith is
now to be found in the Palace of Ajuda and the Museum of Ancient Art in
Lisbon. Joao V of Portugual was a fervent admirer of Louis XIV. His
ambassador to France was asked to provide precise information on la service
a la francaise. The silver he ordered from French goldsmiths Thomas and
Francois-Thomas Germain is one of the glories of the show. The table is set
for 48 guests; over 300 plates, dishes, tureens, candlesticks and the like
adorn its snow white cloth.
Dominating the whole setting is a grand surtout or centrepiece complete with
finely modelled hounds, hunting horn and dead game. A snail slithers out
from under the canopy of oak leaves, tortoises emerge from the feet below.
The only pity is that the opportunity of presenting the table exactly as it
should have been was wasted. The table is far too wide and the effect is
spoilt by the rakish angles of the candles and the harsh spotlights.
Pier Luigi Pizzi's design is more atmospheric elsewhere. The first room of
the exhibition plunges us into near darkness and a moment of pure theatre.
In the centre is a reconstruction of the 10m high column of candles, the
table decoration for the marble courtyard at Versailles for a supper to
celebrate the conquest of the Franche-Comte in 1674.
The use of porcelain on the royal table, and the role of the royal factory
at Sevres, is neatly dovetailed into the story. These brilliantly enamelled
and costly wares were alternated, or used simultaneously, with gold and
silver plate. Louis XV's first, 'celestial blue' service from the Vincennes
manufactory (which moved to Sevres in 1756) comprised only dishes for the
first course and dessert, as did the most magnificent service ever produced
at Sevres, commissioned by Louis XVI in 1783. The king himself drew up the
production schedule, which was intended to extend to 362 pieces. Only 162
were produced - and they were soon the property of George IV.
Dessert was the apotheosis of the meal, served in a different room on a
splendidly decorated table. The most successful table here displays 288
pieces of the Greek Revival dessert service commissioned by Catherine the
Great, along with the silver-gilt cutlery ordered from Paris to accompany
it. Its specially developed ground imitates turquoise, its borders cameos of
antique hardstones. Even the vessels took their form from antiquities.
Ice-cream cups came in the form of kraters, plates appeared like antique
paterae.
More extraordinary still is the dessert service commissioned by Napoleon to
celebrate the success of the Egyptian Campaign. Its centrepiece is a
sequence of biscuit-ware Egyptian temples and pylons, flanked by statues,
obelisks and ceremonial rows of rams.
Plate, porcelain and still-lifes are witness to changing eating habits, from
the pot a oille round tureens, specifically used for the Spanish-style stews
introduced by Louis XIV, to sauce boats for new butter-based sauces and
porcelain tureens whose decoration alludes to the food within. Content, as
well as form, was important.
The exhibition, sponsored by Moet &amp; Chandon to celebrate its 250th
anniversary, continues at Versailles until February 27.

WHO STOLE THE NEWS?

NEWS FROM THE FRONT

LAST OF THE PIRATES
by Samantha Weinberg
Jonathan Cape Pounds 16.99, 256 pages
The trade of Foreign Correspondent has always sounded dashing and dangerous
and romantic - as sometimes it is; certainly it used to be - but it also has
its surprising aspects. For instance, you would expect it to be intensely
competitive: yes, it is, but there can be no profession in which there is so
intense a camaraderie, so much mutual support, such pride in the
achievements of your supposed rival, such alacrity to help a colleague. That
may be a consequence of the difficulties and the dangers, which may also
help explain why it is a profession awash with laughter, jokes and nostalgic
reminiscence, to go with the booze and the boredom, the airports and the
expense account, the bullets and the dysentery, the affairs and the alimony
bills.
Mort Rosenblum's Who Stole The News? is about foreign news coverage and is
infuriating because it is written for an exclusively American audience; its
argument is therefore seriously unconvincing to Europeans. Rosenblum is a
senior and extravagantly experienced correspondent for the Associated Press
and he believes that the reporting of international news has deteriorated to
a dangerous degree.
He blames television: 'For all of its flash and promise, much of our
coverage of news from beyond our borders is hardly better than it was in the
days of Morse code. Television lets us watch the volcano erupt; it does not
show the lava as it is overheating, while there is time to react . . . Most
Americans are shown generalities, simplicities and vast empty spaces, a
parody of the real world beyond their borders.'
That may be true of the US land mass just as it is no doubt correct that
two-thirds of Americans depend on TV for their news and more than one-third
read no newspaper at all. Rosenblum describes himself as a dinosaur and is
nostalgic for earlier, happier times. But this is polemic - very readably so
 -and it infuriates because it admits no cosmopolitan dimension or
corrective, which is surprising in an author who has been editor of the
International Herald Tribune.
The fact remains that people who need or wish to follow overseas affairs are
still served by newspapers which have over the past generation developed a
considerable range and depth of international news and analysis, even as the
TV newscasts have become more domestic and banal and the local papers more
parochial.
Chris Munnion, the Telegraph's Africa correspondent for many years, is
particularly good on the importance of peer-group camaraderie to foreign
correspondents. It is easy to understand its function in Africa in the 20
years after de-colonisation for the men (and, slowly, the women) whose job
was to fly from one disaster to another in constantly frustrating and often
terrifying circumstances.
In Banana Sunday Munnion is writing about the OAHs, the 'Old Africa Hands' -
he finishes in 1980 - and makes proper acknowledgement to Evelyn Waugh's
Scoop.
He achieves the rare feat of describing a great deal of bloodshed while
remaining very funny - the anecdotes never stop. Like Rosenblum, he is
nostalgic for the old days of battered Remingtons and the absurdly
abbreviated prose of cablese, and he is nervous of the new world of laptops
and TV crews. My justification for reviewing a book not yet available
internationally is that I might persuade a London publisher to take up this
gem of the genre.
Munnion is an irredeemable male chauvinist and his political attitudes make
him a typical resident of the Transvaal (not to add a stalwart of the
Telegraph). All the famous stories are here, and many that I had forgotten.
As, for example, when the hacks challenged each other in their adolescent
and well-lubricated way to get a by-line into a British national paper from
Banana - a port on the Congo River - datelined 'Sunday'. It eventually
appeared in the Daily Mail from Peter Younghusband, but was held over for a
day - so it appeared as 'Banana, Monday'.
Sandy Gall, that most laid-back of our TV newscasters, features in Munnion's
pages and has himself produced another volume of memoirs, News From The
Front. He takes up the tale in 1977 and focuses on Pakistan, Vietnam,
Cambodia, the Gulf war and his personal obsession, Afghanistan. There is
next to nothing about news-casting because he evidently rates his life as a
correspondent much higher: it is smooth, urbane, not profound, but these are
the qualities of a successful newscaster. The funniest page is a bitchy
put-down of Kate Adie.
For her first book, Last Of The Pirates, Samantha Weinberg ventures into an
obscure backwater of the post-colonial world - the recent history of the
Comoro Islands, scattered between Madagascar and the east coast of Africa, a
French protectorate since the mid-19th century.
Mercenaries seem to be out of fashion at present - except in Bosnia - but in
the 1960s they were all over the front pages. In the Congo, Bob Denard was
second in notoriety only to 'Mad Mike' Hoare. Denard finished up in the
Comoros, where in the 1980s he ruled the roost and was responsible for two
coups. Ms Weinberg has been investigating these years, in particular the
matter of who shot President Abdallah in 1989; this required her to track
down Denard in his enforced retirement near Johannesburg. Her task is
readably and convincingly achieved and will gratify the tiny minority which
has an interest in Indian Ocean islands, but one cannot resist the feeling
that this is parish pump stuff. The French have followed this topic more
closely than we, and this book is not going to tell them much.
Here, then, are four foreign correspondents, of different age, sex,
experience. It is said that several thousand of the breed are preparing to
fly to South Africa for the April 27 elections. Two things are certain: the
ANC is going to win, and some of those journalists are going to get
themselves killed. But, as someone famously said of the profession, it is
better than working.

FUZZY MONSTERS: FEAR AND LOATHING AT THE BBC
By Chris Horrie and Steve Clarke
Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 315 pages
There must be days when John Birt, the controversial director-general of the
BBC, wishes he had stayed at London Weekend Television where he could
happily have become a millionaire, like many other LWT executives, and
escaped years of headlines and vilification.
There are quite a few at the BBC who also wish he had stayed in commercial
television instead of coming to 'modernise' a key British institution.
Michael Grade and Michael Checkland must be among them. It was Grade who
recommended John Birt as the man to unite BBC news and current affairs,
before falling foul of Birt's ambition, and Checkland who
brought him into the corporation, only to be humiliated by Birt's main
patron Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman.
Horrie, half of the team that 'monstered' Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie in an
earlier book, Stick it up your Punter, here backed up by broadcasting writer
Steve Clarke, weaves a compelling and entertaining tale from the latter-day
'scandals' of the BBC. They range from the sacking of director-general
Alastair Milne to the row over John Birt's freelance employment status for
six years as deputy and, for a time, as director-
general.
And then there were the Fuzzy Monsters of the title - a reference to the
marvellous moment when Checkland finally flipped and publicly attacked
Hussey and the BBC governors for being too old and unrepresentative.
He would rather work, Checkland said, with people who did not think FM stood
for fuzzy monsters.
More important than the farcical rows are the reports on life in the Birt
Broadcasting Corporation and the doings and sayings of the great strategic
planner.
Did Birt really turn up in Manchester and, after a brief tour, denounce the
BBC headquarters there as old fashioned, dirty, a total waste of time and
deserving of closure, even though Pounds 8m had just been spent on
refurbishing the main
studio?
Did he really tell members of a resources committee, when challenged on his
views, that you cannot change your goal, 'and that is the first rule of
effective management. You must not change your vision?'
Luckily, for the sake of viewers and listeners, a great deal of the Birtist
vision has been quietly modified where it has not been jettisoned.
There is much less talk these days of going for the 'higher ground' and
aiming for 'distinctiveness' in programme-making and there is much more
emphasis on providing all licence payers with the service they might
actually want to watch.
Even Panorama, long stifled by the Birtian analytical approach, has started
telling stories again.
Unfortunately, in an echo of the past, the BBC is now trying to make Radio 1
more 'distinctive' with almost immediate results. The network has lost more
than two million listeners according to the latest research - listeners who
are unlikely to return.
Horrie and Clarke, in what will undoubtedly be the first of a number of Birt
and the Beeb books, do justice to the 'fear and loathing' in the
organisation and the feeling of many BBC employees that they were being
subjected to a politically-inspired coup.
The book gets to grips with a number of important questions rather less
well. How efficient was the old BBC? How is it going to compete in the
increasingly difficult broadcasting environment? If reform was needed could
it really have happened without pain and redundancy? Was there a better
approach than John Birt's bureaucratic methods?
In the end, Birt's reputation will depend much more on the answers to such
questions than on Fuzzy Monsters or the fear and loathing he has undoubtedly
provoked.

YANN ANDREA STEINER
by Marguerite Duras
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 12.99, 115 pages
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK
by AL Kennedy
Jonathan Cape Paperback Original Pounds 8.99, 248 pages
A massive oeuvre and an extraordinary, sometimes heroic life have earned
Marguerite Duras, now 80, a place in the Hall of Fame alongside Colette,
Piaf, Violette Leduc and Simone de Beauvoir. Duras's revelation that her
novel L'Amant, 1985, set in what is now Vietnam, about the affair between a
schoolgirl and a wealthy Chinese man, was entirely autobiographical brought
notoriety as well as the Prix Goncourt, the Ritz Hemingway Award and
world-wide sales.
Yann Andrea Steiner, her latest novel, translated by Barbara Bray, is
addressed to her lover and companion for the past 14 years. She wrote about
'the sexual labyrinth' of their relationship in Blue Eyes, Black Hair; here
she recalls in elegaic mood the summer of 1980 when the young homosexual
Breton turned up at her apartment on the Normandy coast, and stayed.
Yann is almost as obsessed with her writing as is Duras herself, and needs
to know what became of Theodora Kats, an English Jewish girl stranded in
wartime Germany, whose story Duras began and could not finish. In the course
of this non-linear, nouveau romanesque narrative Duras offers several
endings but cannot find a resolution.
Theodora, with her white skin and white dresses, marooned at a wayside
railway station, waiting for the train that will take her to freedom or to
Auschwitz, has become symbolic of all women and all Jews. Duras, whose first
husband almost died in a concentration camp and who worked for the
Resistance, with Francois Mitterrand, has the right to take this stance. Her
determination neither to forget nor forgive is evinced as she observes the
residents of a summer camp for deprived children, and imagines them as
survivors of the Holocaust.
Her technique, as she focuses on a teenage girl counsellor and a little boy,
now in longshot, now in close-up, is cinematic, reminiscent of her work as
film-maker and screenplay writer.
The girl consoles the child, with an unfortunately mawkish tale of magic
realism, and as their love grows they might be aspects of Duras the
story-teller, and Yann the listener. Throughout the narrative there is much
reported weeping and laughter, which excludes rather than provokes
sympathetic tears in the reader. Paradoxically, while the novel is sometimes
confusing, its prose has the intense clarity of the coastal light that
illuminates its characters.
AL Kennedy, born in 1965, is at the beginning of a career which has brought
prizes already and the dubious distinction of inclusion in the soi disant
Best of Young British Novelists list. Now That You're Back is her second
collection of stories and shows signs of having been cobbled together to
keep her in the public eye.
Too many of the pieces here are arch makeweights without humour or
psychological truth, but three or four stories demonstrate what she can do
when she engages with real people and situations. It is tempting to wonder
if 'Like a City in the Sea', about a painter married to a much older former
ballet dancer, and the film crew which invades their lives, was inspired by
a television documentary on the dancer Lynn Seymour. Kennedy's dancer is
dying of an unspecified disease, and the dialogue between husband and wife,
who avoid the unspeakable by lapsing into mock-cockney and calling each
other 'Mum' and 'Dad', has an embarrassing tenderness.
'Warming My Hands And Telling Lies' is a warning to writers against giving
readings in schools. A callow young reporter tracks down a woman writer with
whom he fell in love as a schoolboy. Monagh Cairns has abandoned writing and
lives in seclusion. Naturally she disappoints the youth, and he turns on
her; but, determined to relaunch her career, he leaves with an unpublished
manuscript in his pocket.
A fairly routine account of a little Scottish prostitute in London, 'Friday
Payday', is redeemed by its heartbreaking ending when the girl's hard veneer
is cracked by a Tourist Board poster for an adman's Scotland, and a similar
raw pain informs the title story. Two brothers try, literally and mentally,
to accommodate a third who is convalescing after a spell in a drying-out
clinic.
The awkwardness of their shared caravan holiday as they blunder around with
good intentions and bleak optimism in too small a space is portrayed with a
delicate realism that ought to direct Kennedy away from fantasy.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Books: A pioneer of passion - A new biography of Thomas
Hardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDY
by Martin Seymour-Smith
Bloomsbury Pounds 25, 886 pages
In the summer of 1856, Thomas Hardy watched the hanging of Martha Brown, a
hawker's wife who had killed her husband in a jealous fit. 'I remember what
a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain, and
how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half round
and back,' Hardy wrote. He was just 16, and all his life sex and death were
to remain inextricably linked in his mind.
Courting his first wife Emma, he saw her standing by a garden gate as if
against a cross, and had a premonition that in marriage he would crucify
her. Decades later, in his masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, his most
popular and poetic heroine is hanged for stabbing her lover. His blood drip
drip drips through the floor into the room below as did that of a soldier
who committed suicide in a Dartmoor inn shortly before Hardy began the
novel.
How does the poetic imagination work? What sparks the creative impulse?
Modest, formal, reserved, Hardy never looked like the author of his sensual
melodramatic fictions. Henry James sneered at him as 'the good little Thomas
Hardy,' and his own Life, written in the third person as if by his wife and
published after his death, is a model of discretion.
Previous biographers have marked impotence and a sense of social inferiority
as keynotes to his character. Here we have a new picture of Hardy as an
energetic, passionate pioneer who revolutionised Victorian literature,
introducing psychological exactitude to poetry and sexual expression into
novels for the first time. There are flaws in this biography, but
Seymour-Smith's relation of the life to the work is illuminating.
Hardy was born in 1840 to a domineering mother of peasant origins, but
literary aspirations (she gave him Dryden for his eighth birthday). He
became the village school ma'am's pet, and loved the 'thrilling frou-frou of
her four gray silk flounces' - the start of a lifelong romance with
femininity. Behind all his work was his famous roving eye; he would fall in
love with fleeting images - a woman on a steamer, a girl on horseback - and
transform them into richly detailed characters.
Seymour-Smith makes a good case for his wife Emma, the powerful and
difficult first Mrs Hardy, as stimulating muse rather than the crazy
harridan of legend. She is the heroine of early novels such as A Pair of
Blue Eyes, and subject of over 100 poems written the year she died. 'It is
difficult,' Hardy wrote in Far from the Madding Crowd, 'for a woman to
define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express
theirs.' Few male writers have treated women more sensitively; behind
Hardy's tenderness is some of Emma's voice and mind.
In 1885 the couple settled at Max Gate, their hideous gloomy home in
Dorchester; his secretary called the house 'the solidification in brick of
Hardy's . . . mood of helplessness and the ugliness in life.' While Hardy
needed to live at the heart of his fictional Wessex - his Casterbridge is
Dorchester - Emma hated parochial Dorset. Childlessness drove the pair
further apart, and Seymour-Smith suggests that the wife sale which opens The
Mayor of Casterbridge reflects Hardy's sense that he had sacrificed his wife
to his literary ambition.
'Not to be born is best,' Hardy said. His great late novels are bleak, cruel
but seething with forbidden sexuality. On both scores, he clashed with the
establishment. An early review complained that Tess, story of a dairymaid's
doomed love affairs, had 'no gleam of sunshine anywhere, except for some
hours spent with cows'. Jude the Obscure (1896) was billed as Jude the
Obscene; one reader burnt the book and posted the ashes to the author. Hardy
lived until 1928, but gave up writing novels.
Seymour-Smith is eloquent on Hardy as a writer ahead of his time, who paid a
price for outraging his public. It is a fair view, but too trenchantly held.
Firstly, the price was not so severe - Tess, despite or because of the
critics, was a scandalous 1890s bestseller which made Hardy very rich.
Secondly, and more seriously, Seymour-Smith writes as though Hardy is still
attacked on all fronts, and he explodes every few pages into venomous
tirades against contemporaries, recent biographers, academics who treat
Hardy as a 'misguided peasant'.
This is absurd. Hardy does not need defending. Why drown a portrait of the
man in a deluge of aggression and justification? Seymour-Smith is a fine
literary critic, but his book is unbalanced, long-winded, unscholarly and
unedited: no footnotes, shoddy index, Emma still snipingly alive at the end
of the chapter called Emma's Death. And it is wildly speculative: 'Unlike
other biographers, I believe Florence Dugdale and Tom were lovers . . . they
became so at Strafford House at the time of her first visit there. I do not
think, however, that at Strafford House it went as far as full intercourse.
That would first have happened in April 1910 . . .'
Hardy ended life writing poetry, reluctantly married (to his mistress
Florence) for a second time, famous but retiring. Virginia Woolf, in an
anecdote not told here, recalled making the pilgrimage to Max Gate and
finding Hardy silent on matters literary.
'I could only ask him which of his books he would have chosen if, like me,
he had to choose one to read in a train. I had taken The Mayor of
Casterbridge. There was a pause and then 'Did it hold your interest'?' he
asked. In a few lines, Woolf gives a snapshot of Hardy the man which
Seymour-Smith does not achieve in 900 pages.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Arguments rage over the ashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strolling crowds that pack Barcelona's Las Ramblas at weekends will
today throng in even greater numbers and gather halfway along the boisterous
boulevard around the gutted remains of the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera
house.
In the bars and taverns on and off Las Ramblas, arguments will develop.
There will be two broad camps in conflict with each other: the 'Liceu should
stay where it is and be faithfully rebuilt' brigade and its opponents, who
argue that the opera house should be moved elsewhere and be completely
redesigned.
The arguments have been rising in pitch and tone, repeated endlessly in the
Spanish media, ever since a maintenance man's blow torch ignited a curtain
on the Liceu's stage on Monday morning and set the building ablaze.
The fire burnt out the stage, the backstage and the auditorium, a tiny
stalls area and row upon row of perpendicularly stacked boxes. The Liceu was
a deep and gorgeously decorated cylinder but when the flames were finally
put out, what remained was a charred bucket. Only a blackened, roofless
shell was left peering out on to Las Ramblas.
Barcelona justifiably considered its 150-year old opera house to be the
equal of La Scala and Covent Garden. When theLiceu was burned down in 1861,
17 years after it first opened, the city rebuiltit within a year and ensured
that it was even more fabulously ornate than before.
Montserrat Caballe, who started her career in the Liceu and whose brother
and agent Carlos is believed to have an important role in arranging the
opera house schedule, is a stalwart traditionalist. The opera house has to
stay in the 'heart of Barcelona' because, she says, it is a 'symbol' of her
home city. And what is more, 'we have the duty to give our children an
inheritence to feel proud about, just as we received it from our
forefathers.'
The architect Oscar Tusquets, a celebrity in a city that has always put its
local architects on a pedestal, belongs to the second camp. 'What's
happening to us in Barcelona?' he taunts the old guard. 'Have we lost all
confidence about doing something new?' In Gaudi's city these are strong
words.
When it was first built in the 19th century, Barcelona's opera house was
designed to be the flashy cultural citadel of a high bourgeoisie that was
coining it in with its cotton looms and assorted sweat shops. The plutocrats
paid fortunes to buy their own boxes, which came complete with sitting
rooms, dining rooms and private kitchens.
The problem for these opera patrons, who handed down their boxes from father
to son, or sold them for sums equivalent to the price of an average family
home, was that as the city developed, the Liceuended up slap in the steamy
centre of bohemian and working class Barcelona.
It has always been the target for a certain amount of hostility. Towards the
end of the last century an anarchist tossed a bomb into the Liceu's stalls
and in the twilight of the Franco years, when the city was again in ferment,
lefties would regularly jeer at first night audiences as they turned up in
their jewels and tails.
Supporters of the architect Tusquets would like theLiceu of the 21st century
to be daringly innovative; 'courageous' is the wordTusquets uses. They seek
a mix of the Parisian La Bastille and the Sydney OperaHouse which would be
set gleamingly atop the Montjuic hill where the 1992 Olympics were staged.
And they decidedly want a 'people's opera house' since it will be public
money which will be used to relaunch the Liceu - more than Pta9bn (Pounds
43m) according to initial estimates).
The likelihood, however, is that the Caballe camp will win the battle. The
soprano gathered her supporters around her yesterday inside the Liceu's
charred hull to give a necessarily open-air performance.
Caballe sang 'El Cant dels ocells', the Song of the birds, the hauntingly
sentimental ballad of fellow Catalan Pau Casals. Itwas a magical start to
her campaign to have the Liceu rise phoenix-like out of its ashes.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Drama when the veneer cracks - Alastair Macaulay
reviews plays by Alan Ayckbourn and one of his proteges, Tim Firth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Ayckbourn has long been more than a playwright; he is an institution.
The Stephen Joseph Theatre-in-the-Round in Scarborough, which he directs, is
a home for plays by other authors, ancient and modern, as well as by
himself. It was there, under the Ayckbourn aegis, that Tim Firth's Neville's
Island was first performed in 1992; now it has just received an important
new production at the Nottingham Playhouse. Meanwhile back in Scarborough,
the maestro has just presented his own latest oeuvre, Communicating Doors.
Curiously, it is Firth's play that is the more Ayckbournian of the two; also
more funny and more serious. Neville's Island is a comedy in which madness,
insecurity, malice, and cruelty breed, violently and rapidly, amid
terminally middle-class characters: four men on an Outward Bound training
course in the Lake District. Marooned for two days on an island, their
civilised veneers soon crack; and, one way or another, so do they.
Firth's achievement lies in how he keeps this increasingly ghastly situation
funny. By the end, characters have come close to murder, suicide, and utter
despair; they look like savages; and yet there is still a funny side. When
Roy, the most haunted character, goes barmy, all he can do is sing the first
line of Oklahoma, desperately, over and over ('There's a bright golden haze
in the meadow]'); and Gordon yells at him 'Don't you know anything from
Hello, Dolly]?'
And it is Roy - this most crazed, absurd, and unhappy of the four men - who
gives the play its most moving sense of beauty and finer feeling. From a
perch halfway up a tree, he addresses God about the thrill of seeing a
gyrfalcon for the first time. You laugh at the absurdity of this; but only
at first. Finally, you start to share in his rapture and gratitude. James
Fleet's performance is very fine; he never plays anything as a Mad Scene,
and makes Roy's thoughts, whether eccentric or lyrical, quietly luminous to
us.
Tony Slattery plays the central role, Gordon: who is one big torrent of
sarcasm, blame, and abuse. Slattery is a naturally funny man, and the
audience cannot help taking to him. Gordon does most to make us laugh at the
other characters, and at the whole situation; but it is Gordon whose
heartless diatribes drive Roy and Angus off the deep end. An interesting
oxymoron; yet Slattery's performance reveals a slight weakness in the play -
that Gordon is actually its least fleshed-out character. We see how
desperately selfish and addicted to bourgeois comfort he is, but we never
really sense his nervous system. (And he keeps hammering home Gordon's jibes
as if every other word were in italics.)
Near the end, Neville bitterly exclaims how grateful he is not to be as
negative and fundamentally miserable as Gordon. At the time, this makes a
big impact. But until then Neville and Angus have been too wimpish to be
true. (When Gordon, for minutes on end, castigates Roy and drives him
bonkers, they stand by with barely a whimper of protest. You can feel how
Firth wants to draw Roy's madness, Gordon's nastiness, and the play itself,
for another half-hour.) Not that this is likely to trouble any observer at
Nottingham, for Jeff Rawle invests the mild and feckless Neville with such
an extraordinary wealth of convincing detail that he becomes the passive,
well-meaning, blinking heart of the play.
The play is directed by Jeremy Sams, and is probably his finest achievement
(as a director) to date. Only a few touches, such as the slightly stagey way
Angus and Gordon are allowed to make their big speeches facing straight out
into the auditorium, remind us that Sams began to direct only two years ago.
Lez Brotherston's wooded-island-shore decor is both poetic and realistic. I
saw the play on a Monday night; the Playhouse was impressively thronged. The
audience was kept laughing right up to the bitter end: quite a feat.
Ayckbourn has frequently made powerful comedy out of mental cruelty and
nervous breakdown. After Neville's Island, I went to Scarborough expecting
to see a master-class in how to handle such themes.
But what do you know? In Communicating Doors, Ayckbourn is experimenting
with different material altogether. Even the characters are, for him,
unusual. Four of them are VIP class, accustomed to staying in the major
London West End hotel where the action occurs; and one of them is a
prostitute - an expensive dominatrix clad in leather. (This play, by the
way, replaces the one Ayckbourn had announced, Private Fears in Public
Places: which was to have been about the changes wrought to a marital
relationship by a chance encounter at an airport.)
Ayckbourn loves to develop his virtuosity as a craftsman. In The Time of My
Life (another 1992 Scarborough premiere, seen in the West End in 1993), he
let the action of his play move to and fro in time, spanning a period of two
years. Now he takes this idea far further. When the characters of this new
play step through the 'communicating doors' of the title, they find
themselves stepping either 20 years forward or backward: so that the play
jumps from 2014 to 1994 to 1974. Can people step back in time and rewrite
the past (like Superman stopping the world and setting it into reverse)?
Ayckbourn keeps us in suspense about this until well into Act Two.
To my surprise, I found that Ayckbourn of Communicating Doors reminded me of
the virtuoso baroque playwrights who delighted in the play-within-the-play
and the world-within-a-world (Shakespeare in A Midsummer Night's Dream and
elsewhere, Corneille in The Illusion, Lope de Vega in The Great Pretenders)
 -for Ayckbourn shuttles not only between decades but between genres too.
Are we watching science fiction about time travellers? Or a thriller about
high-placed men using women and then trying to kill them? Or a farce about
who will get caught in whose room? Ayckbourn keeps juggling.
But you cannot really get involved in the world of the magnate Reece, his
sinister pal Julian, and his first and second wives Ruella and Jessica. At
times the play's clevernesses seem designed mainly to distract us from the
emotional thinness at its core. The more you admire its structural
dexterity, the more you sense its basic frivolity.
Ayckbourn has some fun, of course, about the year 2014, with talk of
prostitutes being state-controlled ('I'm public, not private'), of the new
fad for Virtual Sex ('with a mouse in one hand and a joy-stick in the
other'), and of English civil war ('Do you think this truce will last?'
'There'll be no more trouble from Lewisham. It's just Croydon being
difficult now.'). Yet, though there are good jokes throughout the play, it
is disappointing to realise how few of them were organic. (The best such,
hilarious in context, occurs as Ruella and Poupay, in 1994, try to plan
retrieving a document from 2014 and delivering it to 1974. 'It's a kind of
relay,' suggests Ruella. 'Yeah,' says Poupay, 'I can't wait.'
To-be-or-not-to-be': pass it on.')
Ayckbourn himself has directed. Things are held together by the zest and
edge of Liz Crowther as Ruella, and (after a shallow start) Adie Allen as
Poupay, the nationalised dominatrix. The other performances are so thin as
to be virtually see-through. And, when you do see through, all you see is
just another of Mr A's maze plays: amazing, more or less, but only casually
absorbing.
Neville's Island continues at the Nottingham Playhouse until February 19.
Communicating Doors is in repertory at the Stephen Joseph
Theatre-in-the-Round, Scarborough, until February 26. Ayckbourn's next play
is expected to have its premiere in April

FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: The doors widen on a Sussex idyll - With 50 per cent
more seats. Antony Thorncroft finds the interior of the new Glyndebourne
theatre rather like a cosy bear pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Christie, the chairman of Glyndebourne, has rarely been portrayed
as Robin Hood, robbing the rich to help the poor. More often he is
criticised for creating the most elitist opera festival in the land, a
musical picnic for the privileged. Yet as Glyndebourne prepares to open its
new auditorium on May 28 with a performance of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro,
the opera with which Sir George's father launched his private divertissement
60 years ago to the day, there is the will to widen the doors of this Sussex
idyll.
The increase in the size of the theatre, from 830 to 1200 seats, with room
for another 42 standing, makes it possible for Glyndebourne to entertain
more patrons. But it has also changed its pricing policy for the 1994
Festival to attract the less affluent. The top price seats now cost Pounds
100, as against Pounds 90 last year, but there will also be on offer seats
at Pounds 30 and Pounds 15 in addition to Pounds 10 standing spaces.
'In the past' says Sir George, 'around 10-15 per cent of the capacity was
left over after our members had been taken care of. Now I reckon over 20 per
cent of the seats will go to the general public'. And, of course, there are
more seats available. This switch has been paid for by the rich, especially
Glyndebourne's 230 corporate members who each gave up to Pounds 150,000
towards the cost of the new auditorium to guarantee the privilege of buying
seats.
Sir George has always kept his distance from his corporate friends. They
were essential to keep Glyndebourne, which receives no subsidy for its
festival, alive. But he is sensitive to criticism that the performances are
just an excuse for boardroom junketings. No company will be able to buy more
than 120 tickets a season at the new Glyndebourne and while, in the past, up
to 35 per cent of the audience might consist of corporate parties, in the
future they will make up little more than a quarter.
The other misconception about Glyndebourne is that its productions are light
and frothy, Mozart between meals. It would be an odd festival without
Mozart, and this year, as well as Figaro, there is Don Giovanni. But this is
a new production, directed by the unstuffy Deborah Warner. There is also a
new production of Tchaikovsky's Yevgeny Onyegin, and the other revivals are
both 20th century operas, Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress and Britten's
Peter Grimes.
This is a good mix of the safe and challenging, designed to help raise the
Pounds 1.5m still needed, but hardly classic pops. Glyndebourne's very real
commitment to commissioning new opera, invariably box office suicide, comes
in the autumn when it presents the premiere of Harrison Birtwistle's The
Second Mrs Kong before taking it on tour, and into the 1995 Festival.
But what of the new building? Is a trip to Glyndebourne still an event? The
first sighting is worrying: it seems as if some giant metallic beetle has
descended upon the familiar Elizabethan manor house. But Glyndebourne folk,
the 6,000 members who get first bite at tickets, will soon have their doubts
resolved. The fly tower, clad in grey lead and towering obtrusively over the
sensibly traditional red brick of the auditorium, is the grit in the oyster.
Glyndebourne remains as delightfully illusionary as ever.
The Pounds 33.5m investment (only Pounds 500,000 over budget) pays off
handsomely. The previous theatre was claustrophobic, uncomfortable and
utilitarian. Its only appeal was its familiarity. The new theatre looks as
if it has stepped out of a Scandinavian forest, gleaming 150 year old pine
everywhere, set off with coverings of that unobtrusive slate grey.
The interior may resemble countless modern concert halls, but its four tiers
provide intimate contact with the action: the distance from the back wall to
the stage has been shortened by three metres. It is rather like a cosy bear
pit. The outside ambulatories offer sensible mingling space and give the air
of a smallish Spanish bullring.
The lawns, and most of the formal gardens, were spared the re-development.
Already new courtyards have been planted with flowers in readiness for the
summer. The aspects that have been lost are the irritating, (or charming),
the inconvenient, (or quaint), those utilitarian nooks and crannies which
physically linked the Christie's family home to the auditorium. Now the
Christies are detached again. The atmosphere of Glyndebourne used to suggest
Society crammed together for an exclusive ritual: now it is more like a
civilised outing to the opera.
Glyndebourne remains a small opera house and the repertoire, based on
ensemble works, will not change. Still no Wagner and little Verdi. But
general director Anthony Whitworth-Jones plans a five year cycle of more
Handel, more Rossini, starting with productions by both composers never seen
before in the UK.
Many wondered why Sir George Christie put himself to so much hassle, so much
expense when the old formula seemed to tick over quite nicely. He believed
that Glyndebourne must change, and the longer the transformation was
delayed, the more expensive it would become. His timing was impeccable: he
raised most of the money before the recession and then built in a buyers
market.
The new auditorium, with 50 per cent more seats, enables Glyndebourne to go
some way towards shedding its image of exclusivity. It has speeded up
membership for a few of the 6,600 on the waiting list - although if you put
your name down now, at a cost of Pounds 50, it could still be 30 years
before you get in. It raises the revenue by around 30 per cent, an important
factor when costs continue to rise and even Glyndebourne finds it hard to
attract sponsors. There has also been a great improvement in back stage
facilities for singers. But really Sir George need give no excuses for his
actions. As he says: 'Glyndebourne is a private opera company. Nothing wrong
with that.'

Rough, unruly and enchanting. Nicholas Woodsworth on the Sulu Sea gipsies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

<TEXT>
Like most people on an ocean cruise, I enjoy starting the day with a
peaceful and leisurely breakfast. I did not mind leaving the Lady Ruth as it
off-loaded cargo at the port of Jolo, and wandering into town to find
something to eat. I was only too happy to escape for a while.
I did not mind, either, that there were no eggs and bacon for breakfast. In
this militantly Moslem part of the Philippines, bacon goes against the
grain. I am as happy with cassava cakes as the next man.
Nor, when four young soldiers sat beside me, did I object to their company,
but I do mind when fellow diners put their M-16 assault rifles on the table.
When military street patrols feel the need to post one man at the restaurant
door while the others are eating, I get twitchy.
Twelve hundred miles away, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta,
representatives of the Philippine government were that very morning sitting
down to peace negotiations with the Moro National Liberation Front, the
Moslem rebel group that has kept the southern Philippines in a state of
low-level war for more than 20 years. But here, in the Sulu archipelago, a
stronghold of the MNLF, no one seemed to know or care.
Perhaps it was because locals become a bit cynical when ideas of peace and
order are mentioned: for more than four centuries, the Sulus have been the
most lawless islands in the eastern seas.
The Spanish, who colonised and Christianised the Philippines in the 1500s,
were unable to impose their rule on the Moslem pirates who terrorised the
Sulu Sea between Mindanao island and Borneo. Not even the Americans, who
took over the colony from the Spanish at the turn of this century, could
gain a foothold on this 200-mile-long string of islands.
Until now, efforts to bring stability and order had failed and, ever since
boarding the Lady Ruth, my fellow passengers - between noisy bouts of
snacking on cold, boiled crab - had provided endless chronicles of violence
for my entertainment.
'Was that June or July the government platoon was ambushed and beheaded near
Jolo?' one passenger would ask to my left, cracking a crab leg between his
teeth.
'And what about that Spanish priest kidnapped on Basilan? Didn't he escape?'
another would say to my right, spitting shell on to the deck.
On and on it went: attacks on foolhardy missionaries trying to peddle
bibles; rampages by 'lost commands' - troops in remote areas who have turned
and taken the law in their own hands; entire villages held up by bandit
gangs; depredations by another rebel group, the communist New People's Army;
on-going vendettas between neighbouring islands; piracy and pillage on the
high seas. The MNLF was the least of it.
Even the Lady Ruth, it seemed, merited protection. Aboard was a military
escort who strolled about cradling their weapons. There were also
hard-looking young men in mufti and dark glasses who wore .38s stuck in
their belts. God knows who they were; I was not about to ask.
Far more disconcerting than all these guns, though, was the Lady Ruth
itself. It was precisely as the song has it - no lady, but a tramp. I could
make out from the painted-over lettering on its stern that, in a previous
life, it had been the Kashima Maru, out of Nagasaki. Worn out and abandoned
by the Japanese, renamed, its bows crumpled by a collision, its engines
weary, today it limps around the Sulus with 500 passengers, 37 crew and 200
tonnes of cargo.
It would not satisfy more discerning cruise enthusiasts. It has no cabins,
just long rows of canvas cots 5ft long and 18in wide. My feet stuck out over
the ship's railing and my arms flopped over the cots touching my own on
either side. The fluorescent lights that burned all night on the roof
overhead were one obstacle to sleep; worse was the rooster tethered to the
railing three cots away. Like all roosters he woke early and, by 4.30 on the
second morning, I was ready to make my own contribution to murder and mayhem
in the Sulus.
But when there is no sleep, there is always conversation. The pair of
middle-aged women sleeping to one side of me looked like two dears on a
shopping spree and, in a way, they were. They were professional smugglers,
they proudly told me. They were going to Sitangkai, the last port in the
Sulu chain; from there it was just a four-hour ride by speed-boat to Sabah,
in Borneo, where they would buy gold to bring back and sell.
Were they not afraid of being caught, I asked. 'Not at all,' one smiled,
comfortingly. 'Naval and customs patrols are all paid off.'
What about pirates?
'Yes, they are a little more trouble,' said the other. It was as if we were
discussing nothing more sinister than avoiding bores at cocktail parties.
'You just have to choose a boat fast enough to out-run them.'
The hours passed. One steamy port of call followed another through odd hours
of darkness and light. Like the rest of the passengers on the Lady Ruth, I
fell into a tropical heat-induced stupor. When we arrived at Sitangkai, I
did not even realise it. I thought we were still far out at sea. Much to my
confusion, so we were.
Sitangkai is not an island at all but a town of 10,000 people perched on
stilts 8ft over the water of a giant coral reef. The Lady Ruth had to dock
two miles away in deep water at a concrete wharf attached to nothing; with
brightly-coloured parasols held up against the sun, we buzzed over the
turquoise sea towards the town in motorised dug-out canoes.
Sitangkai's central thoroughfare might be 6ft deep in water but it gets as
congested as any main street ashore. Canoes, sail-boats, outriggers,
outboards - everything cruises the channels of downtown Sitangkai, from
naked little boys in 4ft punts to mean-looking, forward-raked smuggling
boats that can out-run anything.
I was slightly nervous as I wandered around on the raised wooden walkways
linking shops and houses, schools and mosques. With long hair, tank-tops and
bandannas tied Rambo-style, some of these smugglers looked as mean as their
boats. I was fast attracting a crowd. 'Milikan] Milikan]' children shouted,
pointing. To them, every white face was American. Presumably, every white
face was also rich.
Was Sitangkai as rough and unruly as the other towns of the Sulu Sea? Was I
an easy picking that had drifted in on the current? I was not. Within an
hour, I was sitting comfortably on a split-bamboo platform eating sea mantis
and seaweed salad while warm salt water slopped gently below.
Like many inhabitants of Sitangkai, my host, Hadji Yusef Malabong, is a
Badjao - a sea gipsy. The most pacific, and poorest, of communities in the
Sulus, the Badjaos spend their entire lives on the water. Some try smuggling
but, generally, get pushed out by tougher tribes. Others fish or collect sea
cucumbers, the repellent-looking marine slugs so prized by Chinese epicures.
Most, however, are underwater farmers. They grow agar-agar, the glutinous
seaweed from which extracts are used in everything from cosmetics to ice
cream.
It took a few days to get used to life with Hadji's family. I am not
especially shy, but life with 18 souls in a four-room house of paper-thin
partitions has its problems. Bathing meant crouching on the platform beside
the house and sluicing jugs of rainwater over my head. The lavatory was a
curtain surrounding a hole cut through bamboo decking, and best used on an
outgoing tide.
But I enjoyed it all tremendously - everything from watching the Badjaos
collect their bright green harvest in the agar-agar fields to their strange,
gyrating, gong-and-cymbal dances held under the light of the moon.
My favourite times were expeditions about the reef with Idris, Yusef's
eldest son. Over the water we would shoot towards tiny, stilt-borne hamlets
marooned on a vast, liquid plain. Here, far even from the relative
civilisation of Sitangkai, schools and electricity, hospitals and plumbing,
cars and solid land, were alien elements.
I met people whose hair was burned as blond by the sea and sun as their skin
was burned black. I met people who had never set foot on a pavement but made
daring leaps from house to house, like marine monkeys. Just getting to these
places was exotic. We floated under huge skies of drifting cloud. We
overtook lazy, slow-drifting boats with triangular sails of crimson and
mauve. I might have been on Mars, or on drugs, or both.
I was enchanted. It came to an end only when, a few days later, the Lady
Ruth called at Sitangkai again.
There were the same tiny cots, the same smelly cargoes, the same men with
guns. But the news was good. The MNLF had agreed to yet another cease-fire.
The government was prepared to negotiate peace one more time. And my two
smuggling friends, now on their way home, had enjoyed a most profitable
trip.
Nicholas Woodsworth flew to Manila with British Airways, which visits the
Philippines twice a week at a Pex return fare of Pounds 865 and full economy
fare of Pounds 1,328. In Manila, he stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel
(tel: 632-816 3601, fax: 632-817 2472.
Not all the Philippines is as wild as the Sulus and the Moslem-contested
island of Mindanao. The Visaya group of islands welcomes holiday-makers to
sea-side resorts that are not only safe but as appealing and economic as any
in south-east Asia and the Pacific. Information on holidays and
accommodation can be obtained in London from the Philippine Tourist Office,

FT  05 FEB 94 / Property: Yes, you can live on the Riviera - Despite being a
playground for the rich, ordinary people can find affordable homes there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventy years ago, winter was the high season on the French Riviera. Once
the railway opened along the coast, it took only 31 hours from London to
Nice. And in the novel Tender Is the Night, Scott Fitzgerald wrote about a
hotel near Cannes which (in 1925) 'was almost deserted after its English
clientele went north in April.'
Later in the 1920s, the sun cult took over and life has never been the same.
Estate agents now must always emphasise the possibilities for sunbathing.
Villas have gobbled up the Mediterranean hillsides and swimming pools have
been blasted from the rock. Money has submerged the old fishing villages as
the centre of the region has tilted from the inland towns such as Aix,
Avignon and Nimes to the coast.
Is anything left in this rich garden of hedonism that ordinary people can
afford? Yes, if you look hard. But it might have to be an apartment, or a
house over to the south-west towards Toulouse.
The Romans, who gave Provence its name - it was in the provincia (province)
of Gallia Narbonensis - must have found it an extension of Italy with its
rocks, prickly scrub, thyme, sun and olive trees (olives in France grow only
in the south coastal zone and up the Rhone valley).
The Greeks would have thought the same. Many centuries earlier, they founded
Marseilles and started one of the greatest of their many contributions to
civilisation - making wine in France.
Hardly anything else survives of the Greek tradition, but Arles, Orange and
Nimes have splendid Roman remains while Avignon is a magnet for those
interested in the Middle Ages. Nature-lovers can choose between the rock
plateau of Les Baux (which gave its name to bauxite, mined nearby) to the
marshes of the Camargue, the delta at the mouth of the Rhone where migrating
flamingoes rest.
For art fanciers, galleries abound with Impressionists; Mont Ste-Victoire,
dominating the A6 motorway, is immediately familiar from Cezanne's
paintings. Cuisine is strong on garlic, tomatoes and fish.
Sarah Francis, of Sifex, says it is difficult in Provence to find a house of
character for less than FFr2m (about Pounds 226,000), even though prices
have come down around 30-40 per cent in local terms since 1988/89. On the
other hand, the franc stays strong. But with France expected to come out of
recession in about a year, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's Patrick Dring feels this
could be an excellent time to buy.
Bargains are few, however, and chances are best in new developments where
you might pick up the last apartment in the block at a good price, or with
an extra like the garage thrown in. 'There is no harm making an offer. In a
quiet market, you might be lucky,' says Hilary Katz, of Azur Internationale
in Cannes.
For FFr1.1m, she offers a ground floor flat in Cannes near the Old Port,
with a swimming pool in the gardens. For FFr2.35m, there is a top floor flat
in a development which also has two tennis courts. Outside Antibes, Sifex is
selling a flat with sea view for FFr1.5m; and John Taylor offers two, both
on the top floor, for FFr2.1m or FFr2.65m.
Villas on offer start at FFr1.45m (down from FFr1.65m, perhaps because it
does not have a pool) at Mougins, the cobbled village near Cannes and
Antibes (from Azur International). Ten minutes' drive from there, Azur is
selling a bastide (farmhouse), also lacking a pool, for FFr2.7m. At
Roquefort les Pins, the agent has a villa with heated pool and garden
(olives and figs included) for FFr2.8m.
For FFr18m, there are Beauhavre, a lovely villa looking south across the bay
of St-Tropez to the town (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Hugo Skillington) and La
Porte des Iles at Mougins (Aylesford). Cheaper (from KFR) are the Villa
Constance at Grimaud for FFr11m and, inland at the medieval hill village of
Villecroze, a beautifully-restored farmhouse called La Ferrage St Jean for
FFr6m.
Most costly is the 1972 Villa Mabasque at St Paul de Vence for FFr22m
(Hamptons or John Taylor in St Paul). Reduced from FFr29m, the price
includes a 1957 Rolls Royce - not, however, an ideal car for the steep,
narrow roads.
La Bergerie at St Antonin-du-Var, another old inland village, costs FF6.9m
(GAK Williamson). Alternatively, the vendor will sell one-third freehold
shares for FFr2.3m through a British company. This makes sense, as few
second home-owners spend more than four months a year at their property -
yet they pay for 12 months' maintenance. To help out with costs, the house
and its guest-house take up to 14 people.
The same agent offers a village house in St Christol, between Nimes and
Montpellier, for FFr1.575m.
Inland, in the Luberon valley north of Aix, Coldstone House has an old
property ready for occupation in the village of Roussillon for FFr1.96m, and
modern houses in Lacoste for FFr 1.1m or 2.5m.
At the top end of the scale, FFr4.5m will secure the wing of a medieval
castle, needing work, for around FFr1.5m, and FFr8m buys a magnificent
bastide with seven bedrooms.
Adams House Management, Coldstone's sister company, will look after
everything - including the builder to do any renovations. Partner Christian
Adams finds the Luberon market more active since September. No large
developments spoil the ambience of a lovely part of France, and the wine is
good.
The best buys, however, are further away in the south-west of France using
Toulouse or Bordeaux airports. Sifex is selling a restored farmhouse near
Montauban with about 16 hectares, including a two-hectare (five-acre)
vineyard, for FFr1.65m, and a house on the river Lot for FFr1.59m. This has
a boathouse and a pool, too.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Cookery: A pride of pies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pies, like roasts, are the pride of the British table. From medieval times
to the end of the 18th century, no feast would have seemed complete without
its proper complement of them.
Spices often were used to flavour pies, and sugar and dried fruits were much
in evidence in earlier centuries. The pastry was often of the hot watercrust
type, the work of a monumental mason so to speak: fortress walls designed to
seal and protect the solidly-packed filling and its gravy from air that
might taint it. The whole structure deliberately was made robust enough to
withstand travel along jolting roads.
In the beginning, not all pies were intended for eating. Sometimes, chefs
confected them purely for entertainment, and these 'conceits' and
'subtleties' were displayed. By the late 18th century, though, the
pastry-maker's art began to wane as pastry gave way to the potato.
Great meat or game pies ('treasure chests of the choicest titbits,' as
Elisabeth Ayrton called them in The Cookery of England), elaborate
'coffyns,' raised crusts, towering layers of the flakiest puff pastry and
the most sumptuous fillings slipped from the repertoire of all but the
grandest houses. Enter instead the simple and infinitely homely cottage and
shepherd's pies with minced meat, and fish pies consisting of nothing more
than over-boiled cod under a blanket of mashed potato.
Now, though, many cooks are making fish pies that display some hint of
former glory, and last summer I had some success with some fish pies of my
own. These were filled with salmon, capers, black olives, chopped coriander
or flat-leafed parsley and chives, bound lightly with a lemon and fish stock
sauce, and topped with puff pastry gilded with egg yolk and cream.
Although the pastry was shop-bought, I enlivened it by rolling it out
extra-thin and sandwiching a criss-cross of anchovy fillets between two
sheets of it. The anchovy dissolved to provide a salty savour. An elegant
dish for fair-weather eating.
In raw February, though, substantial offerings are more timely and a classic
steak and kidney pudding is my favourite choice for entertaining foreigners
to Sunday lunch. It is less obvious than a roast and easier for the cook. No
basting to do and no last-minute gravy to make. In fact everything can be
done ahead as suet crust puddings benefit from re-heating.
The only thing I like better than a suet crust pudding is a suet crust pie,
or what the Irish call a ciste. Essentially, this is a stew given a suet
crust lid. It could hardly be easier to produce. No special pastry-making
skills are required and no rolling pin, either. The dough can simply be
patted into a round and laid over the meat when it is part-cooked and the
gravy is seasoned to your liking. Delicious.
LEMON &amp; LAMB PIE WITH TURMERIC (serves 4)
Two cultures collide magnificently here: suet crust, a supremely British
achievement, and the winning north African combination of sheep meat, earthy
yellow turmeric and the tang of lemon. Slow cooking produces a gravy of rich
savour and some of it is soaked up by the pastry.
Spring lamb would be wasted here. Mutton, hogget or mature lamb is what is
needed and neck fillet of lamb from New Zealand makes a good choice. The
lemon should be firm and juicy, grown organically or unwaxed as the peel as
well as the flesh is used. If the weather is freakishly cold or appetites
are gargantuan, make a thicker layer of suet crust. Use 8oz of flour instead
of 6oz, and 4oz of suet instead of 3oz.
For the filling: 1 1/4 lb neck fillet of lamb; 1 lemon;  1/2 lb onion,
roughly chopped; 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped; 1 teaspoon turmeric; a
smidgin of olive oil; 1 1/2 teaspoons flour; 12 fl oz water.
For the crust: 6oz self-raising flour; a scant  1/2 teaspoon of baking
powder; 3oz suet; a seasoning of salt and pepper; 2 tablespoons chopped
coriander leaves; 3 fl oz cold water to bind.
Method: Grate the lemon zest finely and cut the white pith from the flesh.
Discard the pith and chop the flesh into small pieces.
Cut the lamb into bite-size cubes and brown them in batches in a little very
hot oil. (I do this in the flame-proof casserole in which the pie can be
cooked and brought to table). Reserve the browned lamb.
Stir the onions and garlic into the fat remaining in the casserole and let
them take colour. Sprinkle on the turmeric and flour, then add the lemon
zest and flesh and a little salt and pepper. Pour on the water and bring to
simmering point, stirring. Return the lamb to the casserole, cover tightly,
and cook gently for 45 minutes.
Towards the end of this time, make the suet crust. Mix the dry ingredients
together, stir in the water to bind, and finish mixing the dough by hand.
Turn on to a floured work surface and pat it into a disc that will just fit
inside the casserole.
Lay the suet crust directly on top of the filling and cover the casserole
again, slipping a piece of buttered foil (buttered side down) between the
pot and its lid. The foil will ensure a good fit and prevent the evaporation
of too much gravy during cooking. The butter will prevent the suet crust
sticking to the lid if it rises dramatically as it cooks.
Continue simmering very gently indeed for 1-1 1/4 hours until the meat is
tender, the flavours of the filling are fused, and the pastry is puffed up
and light. Keep the flame very low and/or use a heat retarder to avoid any
risk of the bottom of the pie catching and burning. Spinach steamed until it
is just wilted goes very well with this dish.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Food and Drink: Cheap? It has to be champagne - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis in Champagne that began in 1990 is slowly beginning to ease.
Total sales last year are expected to exceed 220m bottles, compared with
214m in 1992, but still well down on the record 249m in 1989.
But that is not the whole story. The increase is essentially restricted to
cheap champagnes, largely sold in French supermarkets, which account for
between 40 and 50 per cent of all champagnes there. Even the leading grande
marque in volume, Moet &amp; Chandon, which sold 2m more bottles last year, had
a downturn in revenue.
The grande marques are still suffering from excessively high grape prices,
supplemented by premiums for the finer grapes of the '89s and '90s that
currently form the basis of their non-vintage blends. While the growers may
be accused of greed, the merchants may at least be partly excused since they
feared insufficient grapes, refused to sign a contract for a diminished
proportion of grapes, and made individual contracts at much higher prices
before the vintage and recognition of the growing recession.
French supermarkets, followed by those abroad, took advantage of unsold
stocks, particularly from co-ops and merchants engaged in the lower-price
market, to buy and sell at little more than cost (a 2 per cent margin was
not unknown) to attract customers.
Prices in 1992 were down to FFr40-FFr45 a bottle at the premier prix, as the
French trade calls it. This means champagne is on the market at little more
than the minimum legal age of one year in bottle. But there is a limit to
the amount of bottles than can be sold at cost and the basic ruling price is
now around FFr50-FFr55.
The top 1993 vintage price of grapes per kilo came down from FFr24 to
FFr20.5 and the lowest from FFr20 to FFr16. The whole crop was sold and a
record percentage of 55 per cent of grapes was bought by the merchants. This
was helped by a three-year agreement limiting the maximum permitted yield to
8,400 kilos per hectare - the equivalent of about 190m bottles of champagne.
A further 2,000 kilos was blocked. The basic cost of grapes per bottle of
Champagne now exceeds FFr20 and a finished bottle, including interest
charges for keeping each year, is around FFr43.
Grape prices are now at least one-third less than at their height in 1990.
May we expect to pay less? No, because price cuts have taken account of this
fall. Moreover stocks are near a five-year rather than a normal three-year
one and allowing for basic cost variations, it adds about FFr5 a year in
interest rates to hold a bottle of champagne in stock. There are no en
primeur sale revenues in Champagne.
Nevertheless, from now we should be drinking higher quality champagnes at
all levels. The third pressing (the second taille) is being eliminated - a
reduction that will encourage growers to concentrate on their best, ripest
grapes. This is accompanied by a blocked reserve of appellation Champagne.
So wine still cannot be made into champagne until stocks are reduced. This
can only mean better quality.
Yet the wide gap between what may be called cheap champagne and the grande
marques will diminish but never close, and the latter may never recapture
their dominant position.
They realise this and, apart from cutting staff and costs, they are
reforming the Syndicat des Grandes Marques, founded in 1882. At least six
members out of 28 will resign, including Mercier, Canard Duchene, and
Prieur, while the rest will agree to buy a large proportion of their grapes
from grande and premiers crus vineyards, they will make their wines only in
their own premises, rather than sub-contracting, and will guarantee the
ageing of around three years necessary for fine champagnes. All this will
take some time, and it may be a year or two before the more distinguished
house are out of the woods.
The last vintage was not, as reported elsewhere, a disastrous failure.
Although the very fine vintage predicted was spoiled by heavy rain in
September, thick skins after a hot late summer and cooler temperatures meant
no rot. The 1993 grape crop, although not a vintage year, will fall very
well into the non-vintage blend that represents about 90 per cent of the
industry's output. As Jean-Michel Ducellier, head of Ayala and president of
the merchant's syndicate, said: 'We do not live in the Independent Republic
of Champagne.' Its prospects must follow world economic trends, but better
wines and stable prices should ease the path to recovery.

Back in the 1980s when saving-the-whale and the rain forests were
fashionable concerns, eco-chic took many forms; one of its leitmotifs was
worry about the growing problem of waste. Eco-chic may be less talked about
these days, but some designers still turn to the rubbish dump for
inspiration. Partly they do so from a dislike of waste, of a sense that the
world's resources are not infinite, and partly they are intrigued by the
random nature of 'found' materials. No piece of driftwood, no chunk of scrap
metal, no shard of broken glass is exactly like another, so designers
working with them are often inspired to produce strangely beautiful and
certainly original pieces of art.
Some use waste material of almost no inherent worth - Guy Taplin's ducks,
for instance, are usually made from driftwood found along the East Anglian
shores. The artist Frances Baruch uses polystyrene, discarded from
supermarkets, garden centres and domestic products, to create weird and
wonderful sculptures. Jane Atfield uses recycled industrial felts as well as
little plastic chips formed from thrown away plastic bottles to make her
striking-looking chairs.
Deborah Thomas and Patrice Butler uses fragments of glass to create
sumptuous chandeliers. Julienne Dolphin-Wilding uses driftwood, old wood and
old cable and rape to create chairs that are half-utilitarian domestic
object, half giant sculpture.
Taking worn-out, dilapidated pieces and making them newly beautiful is not
new. Those who scrub up and redecorate an old and battered chest are
conserving and recycling. Those who have the energy and the enterprise can
learn to do this for themselves. Others can buy refurbished pieces
ready-made.
Scrap Scrap of Endurance Works, High Street, Coalport, Telford TF8 7HX (tel:
0952-586754) will take your old and dilapidated pieces and, by decorating
them, turn them into fresh-looking objects. Prices are beguilingly vague -
they charge Pounds 30 for small pieces, Pounds 50 for medium ones and Pounds
70 for large ones (exclusive of VAT but inclusive of delivery).
Cath Kidson, of 8 Clarendon Cross, London W11, on the other hand, takes
junk-shop finds and sells them already smartened up - putting, say, a zinc
top on a battered chest, repainting them, changing the handles and so on.
Tom Dixon and Mark Brazier-Jones were the fore-runners of what might be
called the brutalist school of furniture design. In their early work, they
specialised in taking old metal and using it to create works of great
strength, originality and high cost.
Both have since moved on to use specialist bought materials but both have
retained a lot of the aesthetic of the brutalist furniture that the
blow-torch and scrap-metal school seemed to produce. Tom Dixon changed his
way of working because 'apart from anything else it was difficult to
produce, say, four matching dining-room chairs which customers seemed to
want, when you are depending on waste materials. Then there are no quality
scrappies around any more. I gave up using scrap-metal when the best of them
were driven out of London by the property boom but one day, when I find a
good dealer, I'll go back to it.'
His furniture can be seen at his new gallery, Space, 28 All Saints Road,
London W11 which will open on April 1st. Also in the gallery will be Jane
Atfield's extraordinary chairs and shelving.
Two designers, Patrice Butler and Deborah Thomas, could be said to be the
Steptoe and Son of the lighting world. Both create magical chandeliers, what
Patrice Butler calls 'jewels for houses.' Patrice Butler's chandeliers have
become icons in certain circles. The Duke of Westminster, Princess Gloria
von Thurn und Taxis as well as Mick Jagger all own one and he is now busy
working in collaboration with the grand old French company of Baccarat. He
makes chandeliers from old beads, Perrier bottles, old glass, almost
anything that catches his decorative fancy. They are not cheap, selling at
somewhere between Pounds 750 and Pounds 3,000 through the David Gill
gallery, 60 Fulham Road, London SW3 (tel: 071-589-5946) which always has
some examples on show.
The David Gill gallery also always has a selection of silent butlers or
dressing-room stands made from chrome and 'found' bits and pieces which have
the spare elegance of a sculpture. They range in price from Pounds 275 to
Pounds 500.
Deborah Thomas's chandeliers made from shards of glass from old ornaments
(from carboot and jumbles sales) as well as milk and other everyday bottles
(she bashes them up with a hammer) range in price from about Pounds 1,000,
and they can be seen at Themes and Variations, 231, Westbourne Grove, London
W11. (Tel. 071-727-5531).
Frances Baruch makes no pretence of using discarded polystyrene to any
practical or functional end - she is simply intrigued by their shapes and
possibilities and tries to alter the original 'found' material as little as
possible. The art lies in the combinations she uses and the colours she
paints them. Most of them are strong, geometric, almost Dalek-like
creatures, exuding immense presence. Her bird trees (photographed here) are
perhaps the most accessible of her pieces and echo the brilliantly-coloured
naif Mexican art. An exhibition of her work called Package Deal will be at
the FHAB Gallery, 106 Boundary Road, London NW8 0RG from March 1st - 26th,
and prices will range from Pounds 75 to Pounds 200.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Fashion: The global wardrobe in the office - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although what you wear to the office in New York is serious business (as is
almost everything else in this workaholic city), Gotham's executives are not
peacocks.
True, chic office garb does exist, but generally only in the creative
professions such as fashion, advertising, entertainment, publishing and the
media. In the three businesses that dominate New York working life -
banking, stockbroking and the law - conservative dress still rules.
For men, that means sober two-piece suits, white or blue shirts, suspenders
(for holding trousers, not stockings, up, although you never know), dark
socks and sensible shoes. The pattern is broken in summer, when blue blazers
with beige/cream trousers and expensive leather loafers are favoured by
those seeking the full 'preppy' look.
Ties remain the quintessential symbol of male individuality, and the 'aren't
I daring with my bright patterned Mickey Mouse silk tie?' brigade is alive
and well. Flashy neckwear is about the only trend from the 1980s that has
not gone the way of shoulder pads and company Porsches.
Women have to be more conservative than men in their dress. Again dark suits
are everywhere, but in recent years more fashionably-cut combinations have
begun appearing on a brave few. Outfits can be looser (physically and
metaphorically) in summer, but the proper New York woman will still wear
hose (tights) to the office.
The one feature that most differentiates New York from overseas cities is
what people wear on Friday. For a growing number of companies in the
metropolis and across America, Friday is designated 'dress-down day'. This
means employees are allowed to wear casual clothes - sports jackets,
cardigans, polo shirts, slacks, etc. The result has been a lot of offices
staffed by Perry Como lookalikes.
Dress-down day has become such a fixture that even some of Wall Street's
finest have experimented with it, albeit none too successfully. It seems
that there is something undignified, un-American almost, about the sight of
someone trading billions of dollars in currencies while wearing a Hawaiian
shirt, baggy shorts and deck shoes without socks.

<TEXT>
Tokyo's prices are among the highest in the world, and the prices of clothes
are no exception. A few years ago, that would not have stopped the city's
business men and women from indulging their taste for fine clothes, even if
the deadly morning rush hour meant that the Y200,000 (Pounds 1,120) Armani
suit or Y100,000 Gucci bag got thoroughly beaten up on the way to work.
For Tokyo's regimented office workers, dressing in designer clothes has
offered one of the few means of expressing some sense of individuality in
the grey, characterless buildings they inhabit.
But in Japan's conformist business society even that luxury is strictly
regulated by a dress code that is conservative, to say the least, by western
standards. The rule to dressing for work in Japan is to be discreet. Bold
colours and adventurous tailoring are discouraged and businessmen generally
restrict themselves to grey or navy suits with equally dull-coloured ties.
Women tend towards the sweet and simple, exemplified in the ubiquitous white
blouse with ribbon or frills. For many a female clerk, a single pearl around
the neck or hair barret are often the only relief from the monotony of the
grey, navy and black uniforms that are still common.
There are, of course, exceptions to the general rule and some younger men
have become more adventurous in their choice of clothes. This summer,
businessmen in tasteful jackets of soft yellow, ivory and pale green were
among the few surprises spotted on Tokyo's subways.
The braver office women, meanwhile, might take a risk with tight-fitting,
body-conscious clothes and miniskirts, but not those planning to stay with
the company for long.
Another change that is creeping into Tokyo offices these days is the
increasing acceptance of discounted clothes. As the recession bites, the
news is that mens' suits at one-tenth the price of an Armani are selling
very well indeed.

<TEXT>
The preponderance of hefty game stews on Frankfurt lunch menus clearly
indicates it is still winter. But demand persists for grilled freshwater
fish and salad. This, with women eaters' determination to show off large
areas of their tanned chests, demonstrates a reluctance to part with warmer
days.
The appearance of lacy white vest-tops in the upper reaches of deep cut
lightweight suits shows, however, that the chill is making itself felt.
Lovats, murky blues, browns and greenery-yellery checks and tweeds now
shroud both sexes lunching in and around the city's Fressgasse (stuff-ing
alley to be literal).
But the cut of the season's day clothes is as conventional and as straight
as the predominantly male customers from the surrounding financial district.
They eat, all year round, in double breasted greys and pinstripes festooned
with redundant buttons.
The Hugo Boss look - captured in suits which appear to be designed by an
engineer - has a firm hold. But there is still a touch of devilry in the
detail. While Frankfurt women appear to be breaking off their long-standing
daytime love affair with shoulder pads, there is no shortage of garish
jewellery and accessories.
Beneath the tables, the diversity of expensive footwear reminds the observer
that the British style shoe shop has yet to arrive in Germany. And beneath
the chins of the men dangle reminders that somewhere in the German soul lies
a sense of the frivolous. Brash, unsuitable ties - penguin and teddy bear
motifs seem popular - remain the norm. The colour is still to be found, but
you have to look increasingly hard to spot it. The conjunction of recession
and the opening of the don't-flaunt-it epoch has left its mark in the
Fressgasse.

Spurred on by Beau Brummell, with his passion for black, white and grey, and
his preference for trousers instead of breeches and silk stockings, British
tailors invented the first office uniform.
Like so much else the British dreamed up in the 19th century, it conquered
the world. Unlike so much else, it has lasted. With some brave exceptions,
such as the arts, the media and the sunrise industries, British men must
still wear dark suits if they expect to be taken seriously in the
professional and business worlds.
Indeed, when one Californian software company opened a British operation and
moved over its top sales team, it discovered that the reason it was doing no
business was its employees' Silicon Valley uniform of jeans, white T-shirt
and unstructured Armani jacket (or beat-up leather biker's blouson).
Potential customers shied away and a wardrobe engineer was called in.
The uniform has relaxed, however. Bright ties and braces - and even coloured
shirts - are acceptable these days, and a chap may even remove his jacket to
flaunt them.
The pinstripe no longer predominates even in the City, although the paler
the suit, the more likely the wearer is to be from one of the creative
professions. In the queasy aftermath of the late 1980s, a wide-trousered,
shiny-textured suit by any Italian designer is just too unpleasantly
deja-vu. Savile Row conservatism had a pre-Lapsarian, comfort-blanket
allure.
Women, admitted to the office only at the turn of the century, have had a
much harder time of it, adopting at first a version of the uniform of an
upper servant, a housekeeper or a governess; a dark, strictly tailored dress
or two-piece with crisp white cotton at collar and cuffs. Only the second
world war allowed women in in greater numbers and more feminine dress. The
coupons wouldn't run to a more appropriate wardrobe.
More recently women have followed the Word from the US, where ambitious
women adopted what the seminal wardrobe engineer, John T. Molloy, ineptly
labelled 'the skirted suit'. It was a man's suit in all but one respect and
could be softened only by a pussycat bow at the throat.
Pioneering women executives, for whom it was important to stand out from the
secretaries, did it with the jacket. They still do. In the British office
the women with jobs rather than careers may wear sweaters and leggings or
even jeans and an old T-shirt (British receptionists and secretaries are the
scruffiest and most cheaply dressed in the world) but, even as fashion turns
its back on hard lines and short skirts, most women feel securely
competitive only in a power suit.

<TEXT>
There is only one absolutely essential accessory to wear to the office in
Paris, and no self-respecting French businessman, or woman, would dream of
being seen without it. It is, of course, the strip of red silk sewn into
your lapel which tells the world that your contribution to French culture,
politics or industry has been deemed important enough for the government to
award a legion d'honneur.
Red silk aside, the only sartorial rule for the French executive is
spruceness; scuffed shoes and dowdy suits simply will not do. An intense
interest in clothes might still be seen as frivolous in the corporate
corridors of London or New York, but in Paris it is a sign of self-respect.
But though the general standard of dress may be smarter for French men, it
is also less formal, with snappier styles and brighter colours. Even a
bastion of the establishment like Edouard Balladur, the prime minister,
livens up his suits with pink shirts and red socks. The younger generation
plump for Giorgio Armani linens or for Commes des Garcons' less outre looks.
The female equivalent to Mr Balladur is Simone Veil, the social affairs
minister, who is rarely without one of her perfectly preserved Chanel suits.
Whatever her age, the professional Parisienne will almost certainly sport a
pair of flat Prada pumps - so practical for those purposeful prowls along
the corridors of power - and one of Hermes business-like Birkin bags,
anything big enough to carry her A4 files.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Sport: The ghost runners - Wishing that cricketers would
write their own books / Bookshelf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With England's cricketers embarked on their tour ofthe West Indies, I took
the chance to read the life stories of two outstanding English batsmen, one,
sadly, retired and the other keen to dominate the headlines by savaging
Caribbean fast bowling.
David Gower's autobiography is available in paperback (Gower, updated with a
new chapter, Fontana 1993, Pounds 5.99), whileRobin Smith's (Quest for
Number One, Boxtree 1993, Pounds 15.99) is a hard-back.
Alas, both chose to produce their books with the help - or at least the
collusion - of a 'ghost' writer, Gower with Martin Johnson and Smith with
John Crace.
The practice of ghost writing is not new. More than a century ago, WG Grace
deemed himself enough of a national hero to write with the help of a friend,
W. Methuen Brownlee, 'who has worked with me over every page and thus helped
me to place this history of cricket before lovers of Our National Game'
(Cricket, 1891). This left Grace more time to play the National Game.
Until recently, most ghosts took their vocation more literally and remained
invisible. In 1956, Brian Statham was helped by a ghost to write Cricket
Merry-Go-Round (Stanley Paul), describing his early career with Lancashire
and England. But there is no acknowledgement of the ghost in the book and
Statham cannot now remember who it was.
As the great fast bowler says: 'He just sat down on the sofawith me for a
few days and jogged my memory. But I wouldn't allow any funny business
because that's not me.' Indeed not. The ghost's function was purely
mechanical; the story was Statham's. As a result, the book is free of the
anger and self-control, revelation and regret, controversy and emotion with
which modern ghosts sprinkle their efforts, to make them more spicy.
We are in an age ofcricket literature where journalist ghosts aim to give
their books style as well as shape. Gower's publishers assure us that his is
'frank and outspoken' (just in case we had been foolish enough to hope it
might be calm and informative). The added chapter is called 'You Must Be
****ing Joking'. All the chapters have joky titles, such as 'Laid back - and
think of England' and 'A millionaire? That's rich'.
Some serious reading is required to work out that the book seeks to tell its
story chronologically, especially as it is constantly whizzing backwards and
forwards, picking up references it never made properly. It ishard to
remember how far the story has got.
Gower makes a few interesting points about Peter Willey's career with
Leicestershire, but they do not get any easier to follow with Willey being
called Peter Willey, Peter, Willey and Willin the space of just over one
page. He gets this quick, muddled treatment in the middle of a chapter about
England's tour of Australia in winter 1986-87 and Pakistan's tour of England
in summer 1987.
While it is not always clear to which player, tour, year or nickname 'Gower'
is refering, Smith's autobiography is easier to read. It was written before
last summer's humiliatingseries against the Australians so, before that,
only his ineptitude against Mushtaq Ahmed's leg-spin had brought him
untoward publicity on a large scale. He describes the methods, particularly
practice, with which he intends to improve histechnique against spin
bowling.
Unlike Gower's book, Smith's is organised clearly, although subjects that
are connected crucially but indirectly with the game - such as the place of
the press in international cricket - are touched on without being followed
through to conclusions. Like many modern cricket books, this is one of
comment without complete argument or observation. It is arranged by topic,
not time.
Perhaps this is partly because time seems less important in Smith's
cricketing life than it was in Gower's, where it brought constant change and
vicissitude. One chapter describes Smith's entry into first-class cricket,
and a closing chapter his tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1992-93.
But all the other chapters deal with issues - for example, Confidence, Luck,
Motivation - and take their material from the whole of Smith's career. There
is something to be said for this system, although it giveslittle sense of
Smith's cricketing development. Nor am I at my best with intensive sport
psychology of the sort favoured by Crace: 'Almost by definition, any player
who feels that he doesn't need a shrink after being ravaged by the tabloid
press needs a shrink.'
It was a relief to read some plain facts about Smith's preparation for
top-class cricket. When the boys' father saw how talented his two sons were,
he took the splendidly imperial step of setting up nets and hiring a
professional as coach to the Smith home in Natal, South Africa. Robin was 10
when he began serious cricket training, sometimes getting up at4.30am to
begin work.
The public has become too tolerant ofautobiographies written scrappily and
badly by increasingly obtrusive ghosts. More than 60 years ago, FS
Ashley-Cooper (Cricket Highways and Byways, George Allen and Unwin, 1927) a
writer and essayist of English cricket's heroic age, warned: 'Whole
newspaper columns, and even entire books, have borne the names of players
who did not themselves write or even inspire a single word.'
We are still ignoring this warning - to our cost.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Sport: England's Back to the future - A preview of today's
Calcutta Cup game at Murrayfield / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England expects. England supporters expect a win this afternoon at
Murrayfield. They will not be too bothered by the score so long as it is a
win. A loss would be too frightening to contemplate. It would mean a triple
whammy of lost causes - the Calcutta Cup, the Triple Crown and the Grand
Slam.
England's famous victory against the All Blacks belonged to their
preparation for the 1995 World Cup, the venue for which is still in doubt.
For now it will have to be stored in the players' mental freeze frames.
Today, England begin their participation in the Five Nations Championship,
which is a tournament that has little or no bearing on the World Cup. Its
onlyplus is that it gives Geoff Cooke, Dick Best and Mike Slemen, the
England management and coaching team, a chance to build a squad of 25
international players, ready to anticipate the bigger prize. The reality is
that Scotland, Ireland and Wales have only the Five Nations Championship in
their sights.
Scotland still cannot believe that they have declined so quickly. A year ago
at Twickenham they looked to have the measure of England until Craig
Chalmers was injured and, after that Stuart Barnes produced that famous
'shimmy' in his own 22 and, aided by Jeremy Guscott, Rory Underwood scored
an audacious try.
Even in New Zealand, when the Scottish members of the Lions pack were shown
to be technically deficient, folk in the Border towns thought it an
aberration and, that once home, the players would prove their worth. Alas,
the horror story continued.
Ian McGeechan, coach to the 1993 Lions side, was able to conjure a Grand
Slam for them in 1990 yet this may well have been their nemesis.
Their own competitive structure is too insular and its talent is spread too
wide. Scotland desperately needs a Five Nations club championship. They have
again juggled their players after the defeat by Wales three weeks ago.
Chalmers may have left the stage for good, which would be a great loss to
Scottish rugby. He was always one for taking risks. Gregor Townsend, his
successor, has as much to carry on hisshoulders as Gary Armstrong, the
absent soldier, now returned. Armstrong will at least let Kyran Bracken, his
England counterpart, know he has been in a game.
When the England team was announced last weekend, there was jubilation
thatNeil Back of Leicester has at last, for whatever reasons, forced himself
into the side for his first cap. Back has the ability, rather like French
flanker Jean-Pierre Rives in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to take a game
by the scruff ofits neck.
His inclusion means England can play a wider game. Indeed, the tactical
options they have with him on board, are embarrassing. His speed tothe loose
ball, followed closely by Ben Clarke, playing in his favoured No 8 position,
means that the English backs will have a chance to run much more ball.
This will test the nerve of the Underwood brothers. Rory has not looked his
old self and needs one of his magical tries to convince supporters that he
has not lost his appetite for the game. His brother, Tony, needs to prove he
is a better footballer than either Mike Catt, of Bath, on the bench for the
first time, or Northampton's Ian Hunter.
Even without Back, the three quarters should be working with more ball
because of the brilliance of scrum-half Bracken's open play. He passes
first. Morris, his England predecessor, always checked the closerange
opportunities for a split second longer than was necessary and then passed.
Moreover, Bracken's pass is longer and gives Rob Andrew at stand-off more
space.
There was also a cheer in our household for the return of Jon Hall, theBath
captain. When international players fail to make the final trial - or these
days the new year training squad in Lanzarote - their playing ceiling is
lowered and they have to come to terms with playing only club rugby, going
on the after-dinner speech circuit and captaining Charity XVs on Sundays or
Gash XVs that open new clubhouses.
Such was my lot in 1980 when, after seven years of final trials and the odd
cap and tour overseas, I was asked to captain a rag bag of a Bath side
against Devizes RFC to celebrate their golden anniversary. It wasthe end of
April, the ground was concrete hard, and the kick-off was at 5pm on a
weekday afternoon - not a time to endear you to your employer when you have
already played 50 games in the season and used up every excuse in the book
as to why this game, above all the others, is vital.
We were losing, much to the enjoyment of the large crowd.
They ran yet another ball at us and, as I was watching this from my
unfamiliar position of fly-half, I thought that if they were to score we
would be sunk. From nowhere appeared a burly youth. He cut the winger down,
got up from the floor and immediately tackled the full-back into touch.
Wing fo rwards rarely consider such action in a friendly. This was no
ordinary wing forward. This was Jon Hall and I have followed his progress
over the past 14 years with keen interest.
He has had appalling luck with injuries and lesser mortals would have been
content merely to play. Not Hall. For him international rugby is a drug and
before he retires he wants one last chance to appear in a World Cup final.
He is one of the few players whose upper body strength is such that he could
have easily converted to rugby league.
At Lansdowne Road, in Dublin, Wales take on Ireland, where they have a good
record over the past eight years, with three wins from four games.
Ireland are always difficult at home and the crowd has become an integral
part of their game. They will need all their support.
Against France in Paris they were woeful and were lucky that it was the
opening game of the tournament. Wales look to have steadied their shipand
made some sensible selections. They should win but much will depend on the
weather.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Motoring: Attempts to halt 'jungle' drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bare facts are chilling: road accidents are the main cause of accidental
death in Britain among all people aged from 15 to 24. One-third of males and
one in four females whodie between those ages are highway casualties.
Male drivers between 17 and 20 are nine times more likely to be killed, and
seven times more likely to have an accident, than middle-aged male drivers.
They are also twice as likely as young female drivers to be killed.
So, you can see why insurance premiumsfor drivers in their teens and early
20s, especially if they fancy a GTi-type car, have headed for the
stratosphere; and why Ford has just pulled the plug on its XR2i and XR3i
models, which personify cars the young lust after.
Against this background, I give full marks to the BBC and the Department of
Transportfor undertaking a safer driving initiative. The first of the
six-part Drive series went out on BBC1 last week and 10-minute episodes will
be screened every Friday at 8.50pm over the next four weeks.
They feature the alternative comedian Alexei Sayle, who pulls motorists up
short by exposing bad driving habits. He believes young drivers in
particular adopt a jungle approach to driving. 'Here we are . . . late-20th
century homo sapiens at the very pinnacle of the evolutionary tree; yet, the
second we step on the gas pedal (sic), we become territorial, predatory
animals,' he says.
Few would quarrel with that; certainly, not I. But is the Drive series
really going to put the message across to those road users most in need of
it? The series features Sayle, a very funny but far from youthful
Liverpudlian, getting into (and out of) motoring scrapes at the wheelof a
26-year-old Rover saloon.
What kind of role model is this for 18-year-olds, many of them influenced by
articles in go-faster magazines that persistin treating motor-ing as a
sporting activity?
Is he going to convince them that their attitude toward driving is all wrong
and make them eager to become caring, responsible motorists? Or will he be
dismissed as a wrinkly with a setof antique wheels who is out of touch with
life on the roads in 1994?
Iwatched the first episode, missed the second and aim to see the rest. I
hope I am wrong and that Sayle's message gets across to those most in need
of it. But Iam not optimistic.
Would it not be better for a television road safety series directed at young
drivers to feature a young hero of the grand prix racingcircuit -
28-year-old Damon Hill, for example? Someone like him could put across to
the teens and 20s the difference between competitive driving and normal
motoring.
In making the point that only immature and exhibitionistic idiotsconfused
the two, he might also make some converts and help to save young lives.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Motoring: In the third estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall's Astra and Ford's Escort have had it all theirown way in Britain's
lower-medium estate car market. Last year, the Astra took 53.2 per cent of
sales and the Escort 37.5 per cent. The only other estate to score more than
1,000 sales was - would you believe? - the Lada Riva.
Things are about to change, though. Citroen's ZX estate will go on sale in
the UK onMarch 1, while the Volkswagen Golf and Rover 400 estates are not
far behind. There will be three ZX estates. Two are Avantage models with a
1.4-litre, 75-horsepower petrol engine or a 1.9-litre, 71hp diesel. The
other is an Aura model witha 92hp, 1.9-litre turbo-diesel.
All have identical five-door bodies 8in (20 cm) longer than the ZX
hatchbacks, which have themselves become Britain's best-selling Citroens,
with more than 75,000 registrations since their launch 30 months ago.
Built-in roof-rack side rails, remote-control central locking and
power-operated slide/tilt sun roof and front windows are standard. Keen
prices are expected to range from less than Pounds 11,000 for the petrol
Avantage to under Pounds 12,750 for the turbo-diesel with power steering.
Uniquely, the 1.9-litre diesel (but not the turbo-diesel) will be available
with automatic transmission instead ofmanual gears at no extra cost.
The petrol-engined Avantage and turbo-diesel Aura estates I sampled rode a
shade more firmly than their hatchback counterparts because the rear
suspension has been up-rated to cope with payloads of more than 1,100lb.
(500 kg). But they were just as comfortable, and a small amount of passive
rear-wheel steering made them feel as nimble as ever when cornering or
lane-changing.
It is easy to hump things aboard a ZX estate because thetailgate opens to
below bumper-top level and the wheel arches intrude very little into the
flat-floored load space. A Citroen accessory dog guard does not get in the
way of the load space cover and can be folded down when not needed.
Last year, nearly half the British buyers of lower-medium estates chose
diesel, which was twice the total for hatchbacks and saloons of similar size
and price. Introduction of the ZX estates must lift the figure far higher
because, good though the petrol version is, the diesels are the ones to go
for.
The 111 mph (178 kph) Aura turbo-diesel is the fastest, has the best
acceleration and, at a constant 56 mph (90 kph), is the most frugal (64.2
mpg/4.4 1itres per 100 km); you can have your cake and eat it.

<TEXT>
During January Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker skied 312 miles; 354,650
vertical feet, or 67.17 vertical miles, measured using altimeter watches and
a mileometer provided by Snow and Rock. They drove 5,000 miles.
Actor and director Clint Eastwood enjoys the mountain air. Lunching at Sun
Valley, Arnie noticed a pair of steel-blue eyes boring into him from the
next table. Eastwood heard that Lucy was from Provence and let loose a
stream of what could be called Foreign Legion French, and then apologised.
'That's the only French I know,' he said.
Two FT readers were anxious to meet Arnie and Lucy at Teton Village, Jackson
Hole. They received several messages from David and Margaret Esau, who had
combed the resort. They later discovered they were staying in the next room.
Resorts visited:
Wyoming: Jackson Hole.
Idaho: Pebble Creek, Pomerelle, Sun Valley, Soldier Mountain, Bogus Basin,
Brundage Mountain.
Oregon: Mount Bachelor, Mount Ashland, Mount Hood Meadows, Timberline.
California: Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Mount Shasta.
Washington: Ski Bluewood, Stevens Pass.
British Columbia: Cypress Bowl, Whistler/Blackcomb, Silver Star, Big White,

FT  05 FEB 94 / Gardening: Your strategy for summer starts now - Play it by
eye when designing the layout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beneath the wind and rain, the year is ahead of itself; among the snowdrops,
gardeners need to take a grip. The sunlight has that pale washed tone to it
and buttercups are creeping wherever you want them least. If you are
planning to change things, map out your strategy and start now.
Like untried horses, new garden-owners will do anything rather than face the
fence head-on. Where must I go to learn to draw? I was asked yet again last
week by a new female recruit to FT gardening. Her City husband has given her
charge of their new garden by default during the week: she feels she can
start only if she gets it down on paper.
Why bother? I always tell them, unless you want the social life of an
architect's class. Every book on the subject now tells us to buy squared
graph paper, reduce our new garden to a scaled grid plan and experiment with
modules. We are all being brain-washed.
Drawing has no necessary connection with garden planning unless you want to
design gardens for other people. You have the vision in your head, which is
the best place for it. What you need is string, not graph paper. Better, I
find, to work it out on the site. Learn to look, not to draw.
There are mistakes which we all make: planting too closely, making beds too
small at the first attempt, and succumbing to impatience. They are our
basics, and that is why we keep straying back to them. But there are other
mistakes which we really should not make: mindless imitations of bits of
other people's gardens; fussy curves and features; multi-coloured foliage
where a good green leaf would be better; gardens with the wrong season and
no sense of place. Drawing lessons will do nothing to protect you from these
mistakes.
Instead, begin by appreciating what you have: the site and its setting with
all its probable ghastliness. It could be so awful that you want to turn
inwards and develop a contrary fantasy: block in your own setting by using
good evergreens, box osmarea, yew, or the cherry laurel if you live in the
country and are in a hurry. Stage design is often a better starting point
than architectural drawing: give the garden props which are to be clipped
from its green screen without going over the top.
You might be more fortunate. Between the neighbours and the sodium lighting,
there could be a character which you can pick up, something which tells you
to go for a low-growing formal design or a vista to your only decent tree.
Fasten on the intuition and dress it up mentally, as if you are dispensing a
wardrobe round it. You then have the beginnings of the style, not a recycled
copy of Sissinghurst in London SW10.
Some people are helped by colour photographs of other people's gardens, but
I find they make me envious and suspicious simultaneously: photographs lie,
although the best ones can set you off at a tangent.
If you are stuck, think back to your childhood in the hope you can conjure
up a scene, a setting or a place with ideal landscape you want to recapture.
You might as well be explicit because it could well be there implicitly,
anyway.
Most of us design a garden only once or twice in a lifetime and, when I know
the personal history, I often find it easier to see why somebody went for
that particular style. If you cannot remember anything about your childhood,
you might well decide that garden designing is not your first priority until
you have unravelled other balls of personal string.
This advice is probably most helpful for people with bigger gardens who do
not need to turn inwards and create their own stage. It does not matter if
the intuition is not altogether true to reality. I remember how Ottoline
Morrell, the Edwardian hostess, described her village of Garsington as the
most Italian place in Oxfordshire. It was not Italian at all, but she
presided over a good, formal garden developed in the belief that it had this
latent genius.
Sometimes, you see something and then you must go for it, even if others are
doubtful if it is really there. The result will be personal and successful.
This encouragement might seem rather abstract and you could want to draw
with a ruler and feel better instead. I will end with one specific tip.
Much more is now being written about planting schemes and putting plants
well together. The recent seasons have made glorious nonsense of them by
bringing out the flowers early and spoiling all these designer groupings.
Nonetheless, I think they miss a more important point.
The style of planting needs to vary with a garden's size. Unless you want a
two-weeks wonder, sequence and season ought to be the next obsessions after
your initial vision. In a very small garden, you have no choice; you can
choose only one or two plants for each month and spread them round a small
plot. In a big garden, you can do what the books now tell you and plant
those seasonal groupings and special blocks of colour at particular seasons.
When they are over, you can walk past them to the clump of the moment
somewhere else.
Most of us do not live in big gardens but on sites up to half an acre at
most. Here, we would do better to scatter the features of the moment round
the main design, rather than amalgamate them in one clump.
Textbooks tell you the result is spotty - but it is not if you give the main
setting a coherent framework of green hedging and shrubs. As you set out on
this new season, I would tell you to be more relaxed, spread it around, and
give your eye something at all angles, repeated at each season.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition: Many a
welcome in the mountains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
But where is the mountain? We were desperately scanning the night sky for a
glimpse of anything resembling a hill. At last we found a road which
zig-zagged 16 miles into the sky and as we neared the resort of Bogus Basin
in Idaho we were relieved to be dazzled by arc lights illuminating dozens of
night-skiing trails.
There have been some touch-and-go moments for Lucy Dicker, my companion, and
I during the first month of our round the world expedition - but we're still
on course to ski every day of 1994.
Sceptical colleagues who accused us of taking a year-long holiday have been
proved wrong as we have already endured illness (colds), injury (slight),
and theft (cameras and credit cards), plus the welcome attentions of the
North American media.
We have, of course made mistakes: one bad one was to drive on an ordinary
mountain highway instead of an interstate on our way to the windswept slopes
of Mount Bachelor in Oregon.
We drove for nine hours through a relentless blizzard and there were times
we could not distinguish between the road and surrounding fields.
Early in the night, we spotted a motel and were tempted to stop. But
something felt wrong. Then we saw the name: in dimly-lit neon, Bate's Motel.
My foot hit the accelerator and we hurtled into the night.
Celebrities, such as actor Clint Eastwood, have wished us well and we have
even become minor celebrities ourselves, receiving incredible welcomes
everywhere we have been. One of the more dramatic was a mountain-top
champagne reception and a huge banner at the top of Monument Peak at
Heavenly in California. It was a moving sight, with giant red letters
reading: 'A Heavenly welcome to Lucy and Arnie, round the world skiers.'
Our odyssey began on new year's day at Jackson Hole in Wyoming, which we
reached courtesy of American Airlines. A couple of days later we were at Sun
Valley, Idaho, the grande dame of American ski resorts.
Celebrities visiting Sun Valley over the years must almost have outnumbered
the entire pre-war population of Aspen. Their photographs, lining the long
museum-like corridors of the lodge, stare down at you: Gary Cooper, Marilyn
Monroe, the Shah of Iran, Clark Gable, and Judy Garland.
Lucy and I tip-toed down the corridor to snatch a glimpse of the restaurant
where we were relieved to find the Maitre d', was most welcoming.
When he discovered that Lucy was from his native Provence, he ushered use to
the best table in the house and insisted on treating us like the Hollywood
stars who had stepped off the train 40 years earlier. 'It is not every day,'
he said, 'that we have someone in from Marseille.'
Bogus Basin in Idaho got its name because in the 1860s rumours that there
was gold here attracted prospectors from far and wide. But location became
notoriously difficult to find and the 'gold' turned out to be pyrites. We
had problems finding it too. Once settled in, however, Bogus provided some
of our best snow and most picturesque skiing.
An instructor called Bud Piggot (he pronounced it like Peugeot) skied with
us through the tree-lined avenues of Brundage Mountain, Idaho. Much as he
loves skiing, his preference is to roar over the slopes rather than down
them - his passion is aerobatics in a Pitts stunt plane.
After the Bates Motel scare on the way to Mount Bachelor, we recovered with
an early brunch at the Sun River Resort and were ready for anything -
including Mount Bachelor.
Bachelor is a barely extinct volcano, with a snow-covered cone that permits
almost 360 degrees of skiing. Unfortunately the top half of the mountain,
with the most challenging skiing was enveloped in a cold mist, and neither
visible nor skiable.
At Mount Ashland, Oregon, we did manage to get above the grey ceiling that
seems permanently to box the town in. Ashland is famous for its
Shakespearean theatres and festivals and the resort, recently rescued from
closure by local residents, has named many of its trails after Shakespearean
plays and characters.
It was as we left Ashland that we first saw the most beautiful mountain
rising into the heavens in the distant Cascades, a series of single volcanic
mountains. This one was special. Even from more than 100 miles away, we knew
we had to ski at Mount Shasta.
First, though, we had an appointment with the high Sierras surrounding one
of the world's most beautiful stretches of alpine water, Lake Tahoe.
Heavenly, above the lake, combines sunshine with a snow-making programme on
the California and Nevada sides of the mountain.
Nearby Squaw Valley turned out to be Lucy's favourite resort so far. With
six mountains to choose from, we were spoilt for choice. One of them -
Emigrant Peak - was a stark reminder of tragic events during the last
century when many immigrants perished in their search for a way across the
Sierras.
People still perish today on Mount Shasta. More than 14,000ft high and
riddled with glaciers, this noble peak attracts weekend hikers who set out
to climb it in shirt sleeves as if it were an afternoon stroll.
We hate to leave, but Washington awaits: 'Bluewood welcomes Financial Times'
said the sign above the lift station.
'But what made you come here?' asked Stan Goodell, the owner, incredulously.
Bluewood is scarcely known outside Washington and has only one serious lift,
although it does give access to 22 trails.
British Columbia's resorts made us so welcome we didn't want to leave.
Silver Star, Big White and Apex are hoping to attract skiers from Europe who
want to enjoy a variety of skiing in more than one resort. Each is only 90
minutes or so from Kelowna, from which skiers can ski all three areas.
Unlike the others, Red Mountain, another British Columbian resort, has the
old mining town of Rossland at its base. Canada's first ski competitions
were held here just before the turn of the century.
Although the skiing later expanded to another peak, Granite Mountain - where
we skied Long Squaw, the best cruising run I have skied for years  - the
resort has retained the original name.
Panorama resort, whose outstanding views of the Canadian Rockies explain its
name, has built a new T-bar to the top of the mountain called
Top-Of-The-World. This gives the resort a vertical drop of 4,300 feet,
second only to Whistler/Blackcomb (5,280 feet) in the whole of North
America.
And in Lake Louise, Alberta, we celebrated our first month on skis - so now
it's on to the next month.

FT  05 FEB 94 / The tone of racial abuse: The perils and frustrations of
being a black man in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the sight of me, the white policeman flew into a rage, gesturing wildly,
his eyes burning as I approached. Although his language was mostly
Afrikaans, I could still recognise the tone of racial abuse.
Seeing the pistol strapped to his waist, I abandoned plans to ask him for
directions to Johannesburg's World Trade Centre, where historic talks on a
new constitution for 'a democratic, non-racial South Africa' were taking
place.
I jumped back into the car and, trembling, drove on to find another way to
the centre.
I had read the books, seen the television pictures and spent time talking to
friends and contacts, yet nothing adequately prepared me for South Africa.
In a country where colour is everything, the first thing I had to contend
with was being black.
That incident was to be the first of many ironies and inconsistencies during
my two-month stay.
South Africa had fascinated me since I first became aware of apartheid as a
child in Uganda.
Although discouraged by anti-apartheid campaigners from visiting South
Africa, questions kept churning in my mind. What had apartheid done to the
non-white population? Was it true that the blacks in South Africa were
better off than those in the rest of the continent - an argument that was
often used by government officials to justify the regime? What did it mean
to be called an honorary white?
The 1980s had brought the first cracks in the gospel of apartheid. In 1990,
formerly proscribed parties were no longer banned and Nelson Mandela, leader
of the African National Congress was freed.
Negotiations between former enemies began and last year the date for the
first non-racial election was set: April 27 this year. I felt it was time to
witness the changes at first hand.
The first of the many ironies became apparent in the suburb I was to visit
with two white friends. It used to be termed a 'white' area until the Group
Areas Act was abolished in 1989.
I had seen several black people in the area. Society had really changed, I
thought, but reality soon dawned when I learned that most of the blacks I
had seen were domestic staff working in the area.
In the course of my stay, it was commonplace to be ignored by white people
as only my white colleagues were spoken to. When I was not being ignored I
was being insulted. A manager at a gold mine on the outskirts of
Johannesburg decided to repeat slowly everything he told the other
journalists, so that I could understand.
I learned to cope with such petty aggravations - but there were more
significant ones to come.
I asked a white woman in Johannesburg about visiting Durban. She looked
surprised and said: 'You must be careful of going to Durban as it is full of
low-class black people.' A white male colleague tried to explain and said
simply: 'You see, you are not from here. You are a black from overseas.' I
was supposed to feel heartened by such sentiments.
Yet, on several occasions this distinction was important. Just outside
Johannesburg a white man refused to let me use a public phone as he had a
series of calls to make. When I asked where the next phone was he looked up
and said: 'Oh you must come from Britain. Here, come and use the phone.'
Even more startling was the extent to which apartheid had taken hold in the
minds of black people. Among professionals, only around 5 per cent of
management positions and less than 1 per cent of senior executive positions
are occupied by black people. Yet, at a conference I attended for black
managers and executives, the agenda was derailed as delegates argued about
who was black and who was not for the purposes of affirmative action.
On learning you are a visitor, almost every white South African you meet is
eager to impress upon you how things have changed. The frequency and
promptness with which it is said, is almost convincing until you ask them if
they have been to a township, or had extensive contacts with black people,
other than their domestic staff.
The reply is often a mumbled 'no' as the conversation is moved on. White
guilt for the evils of apartheid appears to be the new disease.
On a visit to a tea estate in the north-east of the country, one white
manager told me: 'We were among the first companies to introduce affirmative
action in South Africa nearly 12 years ago. Today nearly 70 per cent of the
management staff is black.' But not one of the 10 or so senior management
present was black and none of the management appeared to have noticed the
fact.
Cape Town, home of the country's parliament, proved to be more friendly than
Johannesburg and more or less incident free. For the first time I began to
feel as relaxed as one can ever be in a foreign country.
But as I left South Africa, all I could feel was an overwhelming sense of
anger, and frustration at the humiliation any black person still has to
endure; and because after more than 30 years of independence, South Africa
had squandered the opportunities which few other countries on the African
continent could match.
The frustration came from trying to understand how the world could have let
apartheid happen, and how the consequences of the experiment will last for
generations.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Fishing: Softly, softly nets the prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These fish were hard to catch. As we could not catch them we told each other
when one jumped: 'Did you see that one, Pierre?' The guides in wide-brim
hats, mosquito head-nets concealing heavy moustaches, egged us on.
The problem was the weather. Salmon in Quebec take the fly when the water
temperature is between 58`F and 64`F. It was 68`F. The sun was scorching,
and the nights lacked the chill they should have had.
The problem was also the fish. They were big, so big that when they jumped
they hung in the air so you could study them. They were pink, and had been
in the river awhile; disinterested in rising.
The last problem was the fishermen, as it transpired. Julien had an acute
and canny guide who stood beside him watching the water hungrily. While the
rest of us plied our tireless craft over the pools containing the big fish,
Julien was upstream casting over a rippling glide where the water was
cooler, more oxygenated, more activating.
In a brace of shakes he had lost two, great silver, twisting, gleaming
things taking to the air and spitting out the fly or snapping his tackle.
We all wanted Julien to get one. The line tightened. Guides began scrambling
to assist him, shouting instructions, charging towards him through deep
water. The fish played doggo, obviously a big one. Taking the rod the guide
tested the pressure: firm. Julien had hooked a rock.
In a Canadian phrase: 'There are fishermen, and there are fishermen'.
There are also fisherwomen. We had one in our midst, a professor of plastic
surgery, female record holder for the largest bluefin tuna. Ramrod-straight
and with an avalanche of white hair, Madame Colette was accompanied by
another tuna record holder.
He presented himself as the only man ever to have caught two bluefins of
more than 1,000lbs in a day. He said he was once world champion skeet
shooter, and also the shooter of some tall-sounding stories - 'I like to
shoot birds, many birds; in Argentina I shoot 8,000 doves in 12 days'.
On the morning of rude awakening, all but these two fishers were despatched
to outlying bits of river. Colette and her companion then did strange things
to land heavy salmon. They put on light tackle and microscopic flies the
size of gnats. Their approach to the pool in which the fish were
concentrated, history relates, was stealthy. Standing well back they
extracted two salmon in 15 minutes, Colette's the heavier. At 16lbs it was
the lightest, she informed us, she had ever caught on this river.
Quebec has over 110 major rivers for salmon, an awe-inspiring statistic.
Several are world-class fly-waters containing very large salmon. On the
Gaspe Peninsular's York River a man once caught a 47-, 37 - , and three
30-pounders, plus five more, in one day. Now catches are limited.
The land is formed of rolling rock plateaus almost uninterruptedly clothed
in spruce. The rivers cut canyons through pristine wilderness. Waters are
potable and totally clear.
The first people to appreciate the sporting charms of this fecund land were,
unsurprisingly, the British. In the 1870s Lord Dufferin, Governor General of
Canada, acquired leases on some of the Gaspe rivers, reached in those days
by Indians paddling up the shallows in canoes. Although half of the
province's salmon fishing is still in private leases from the government,
much in the last 40 years has been made public as the old leases expired.
Since the democratisation of salmon fishing, pressures on pools have
multiplied; several fishermen may rake one pool simultaneously. Canadian use
of the dry fly enters here. Fluffy concoctions are lobbed upstream and
allowed to tip down the ripples with no drag. This brings salmon up to try
and drown the nuisance if not swallow it.
Canadian fishers, unconstrained by British traditions and inhibitions, have
looked at salmon fishing in fresh ways. Getting a big fish off the bottom in
a clearwater grotto may involve a half-day campaign, employing look-outs
from above studying the fish's reaction to passing temptations.
Cultures reveal themselves in people's attitude to salmon fishing.
Indians in Vancouver exercise their historic hunting rights by scooping out
spawning salmon in supermarket trolleys. The French, who ruined their
migratory fish waters long ago, are enraptured with the mystique of le
saumon as an envoy from a lost world. The Irish leave all matters to be
settled by God and illegal nets. The French Canadians assemble at dawn on
remote riverbanks, nourished by beer from a chill-box, and tell stories.
Voltaire said that Canada was: 'A wretched country covered in ice eight
months of the year, inhabited by barbarians, bears and beaver'.
Clearly, he was not a fly fisherman. When British fishermen are thronging to
experience the discomforts attending big-number salmon fishing in Russia, it
is extraordinary that on Quebec's dream salmon rivers they remain virtually
unheard-of.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Shelling out on growth - Partners
faced with losing Pounds 1m find their fortune in the garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Derek Spice and Jane Hanckel moved to Afton Manor on the Isle of Wight
in 1988, they needed to make money. They were in the process of losing more
than Pounds 1m - Pounds 200,000 on their former home in Virginia Water,
Pounds 500,000 at Lloyd's where Spice was a Name, and Pounds 500,000 in
shares in a motor-accessories company from which he resigned when it went
public in 1986. It went into liquidation in 1991.
At Afton Manor they offered bed and breakfast, opened a camp site and
imported a lorryload of cocoa shell as a mulch for their own and other
gardens.
B &amp; B meant breakfasts at 7am, and campers kept turning up at any time,
including weekends.
This experience focused their minds: 'We decided that the business with the
least aggro and most potential was cocoa shell,' said Hanckel.
They called the shell Sunshine of Africa and it has proved a winner: it was
made a 'best buy' in a Which? survey which compared it with garden mulches
based on tree bark, and it was used last February in a BBC gardening
programme. The partners expect to sell more than Pounds 1m-worth in their
current year.
The shells used are stripped from cocoa beans during the cocoa-making
process. When applied to the garden, they preserve moisture in the soil and,
when they break down, supply plant nutrients.
Cocoa makers normally sell the shell ground up for cattle food but gardens
need it to be as undamaged as possible. Unbroken shell takes up four times
the volume and so needs more lorries to move it - and it can require cocoa
factories to amend their manufacturing processes to avoid damage.
Spice and Hanckel financed the business themselves by selling their Porsche
and some life assurance policies. A picture of the Porsche hangs
nostalgically in their office.
The pair moved to the Isle of Wight because they liked the sense of
community: 'People were here because they wanted to be here. We had been
living near the M25 where, not surprisingly, we had the feeling people were
just going round in circles,' said Spice.
He had always used cocoa shell on his own garden, following the advice of
his father, a former managing director of Gill and Duffus, commodity
traders. After leaving Gill and Duffus, Spice's father had set up WG Spice
and Co, a cocoa processor at Hook in Hampshire, and Spice worked there for a
while. And so Spice initially went to Hook for cocoa shell supplies.
In February 1989 he and Hanckel advertised their produce, offering a minimum
of two 140-litre bags at Pounds 5 a bag and the Isle of Wight proved an
ideal test market. Gardeners used it and then their neighbours wanted it
too. Soon, Ventnor Botanic Gardens and the horticultural department at the
island's college became customers.
In a year, the partners sold 1,500 bags, five lorryloads. Articulated
lorries visited Afton Manor and unloaded the shell on the tennis court where
the gardener and two helpers shovelled it into sacks.
The next step was to sell Sunshine of Africa through garden centres. They
designed their own waterproof bags and a display stand, which helped Spice
to persuade four garden centres to order 150 bags on his first day of
selling.
They soon had deals with garden centres in all the main urban areas and by
March 1992 were advertising Sunshine of Africa nationally.
One difficulty was to match sales to the supply of cocoa shell: garden
centres like to place orders in September and take delivery and make payment
the following spring. The company now takes out bank loans, secured against
business assets, to help bridge this gap.
Spice and Hanckel lost an important supplier when the WG Spice plant at Hook
ceased production. A replacement supply was found when Nestle, the food and
drink group, agreed to sell the shell from a new processing unit at York.
The company expects to sell Pounds 1.6m-worth of cocoa shell in the year to
July, against Pounds 650,000 in the last year, and aims for a net profit of
between 10 and 12 per cent.
Shell prices have risen but the volume of business makes up for smaller
margins. The price in a garden centre is currently Pounds 9.99 to Pounds
12.50 for a 120-litre bag. It is also sold in three smaller sizes.
Other companies now supply shell for British gardens but Spice and Hanckel
were prepared for this, which is why they have sold Sunshine of Africa as a
brand, not cocoa shell as a commodity. With 90 per cent of the market, they
also expect interest from the bigger companies whose mulches were beaten
into second place in the Which? survey.
Their next plan is to offer licences and know-how to other countries: quite
a big step for a product that was test-marketed in the gardens of the Isle
of Wight.

<TEXT>
Customers at Marks and Spencer will, from early next year, be able to buy
pensions and life insurance as well as food and clothes. The UK's best-known
retailer is to broaden its financial services - it already deals in unit
trusts and charge cards - but says its financial advisers will be paid
entirely via salary, not commission. The new service will be available at
six stores initially, but the aim is that it should spread to around 50
during the year.
*****
The public offer for the Kleinwort European Privatisation investment trust -
the biggest UK launch yet of such a trust - was three times subscribed, so
applications are being scaled back. The trust had set its maximum size at
Pounds 500m, but meeting all applications in full would have increased it to
more than Pounds 880m.
Investors who applied for the minimum 2,000 shares will receive 700.
Applicants seeking up to 2m shares will get about 31.45 per cent of that
amount while applications for more than 2m will receive 31.45 per cent of
the first 2m, and 25 per cent of amounts above that.
Shares in the trust are partly-paid, with the remaining 50 per cent due on
August 1. One warrant is being issued with every five shares.
Interim certificates will be sent out on February 8, together with cheques
for returned money. Dealings in the shares and warrants will start
separately on February 9.
The public offer for the similar Mercury European Privatisation trust closes
on March 2. Its maximum size has been set at Pounds 575m, and Pounds 325m of
that has been raised already through an institutional placing. Shares are to
be fully paid, with one warrant for every five.
*****
Guinness Flight is launching a unit trust specialising in global
privatisations, the first of its kind. About 65 per cent of the Guinness
Flight Global Privatisation trust will be invested in Europe, 25 per cent in
the Far East and Australasia, and 10 per cent in other emerging markets such
as South America.
Andrew Couch, one of the managers, said companies owned by the state before
being privatised tended to be asset-rich, have a large market share, and to
be priced fairly cheaply because governments needed the sale to go well.
Often, there were efficiency gains, particularly from reduced labour forces
and the introduction of new technology.
Initial charge for the fund will be 5 per cent, reduced to 3 per cent during
the launch period of February 14 to March 4. Annual charge will be 1.25 per
cent. The fund's holding of more than 50 per cent in European shares means
it will be Pepable. Fees on the Pep are 2 per cent initial, 1.5 per cent
annual, and a decreasing withdrawal charge of 3 per cent in the first year,
2 per cent in the second and 1 per cent in the third.
*****
The second instalment on British Telecom partly-paid shares is about to fall
due. Lloyds' registrars must receive cheques by February 24 so they can be
cleared before the deadline of 3pm on March 1. The second instalment price
is 140p a share except for those holding interim rights who qualify for the
instalment discount. They will pay 130p on the first 1,000 shares.
Investors who do not pay the second instalment on time may lose their right
to the shares, together with any entitlement to dividends or incentives such
as bonus shares. If the Treasury takes back the shares and sells them,
defaulters may be entitled to a refund of 150p maximum a share.
Shareholders who have not received a payment notice by Tuesday, February 8,
or who have lost it, should telephone the Lloyds' help-line on 0903-503 733.

Alliance &amp; Leicester, Britain's fourth-largest building society, is to
integrate personal customers of its Girobank subsidiary. But the only
resulting novelty for Girobank's 1.4m personal customers will be a new logo
 -GIRO - branding the services available to them.
A &amp; L said Girobank customers would continue to have the same rates and
services as they do now and could still use post offices and the Girobank
telephone banking facilities. The society has acted already to cut any
overlap in products.

If you have a Switch debit card, you could soon use it for a range of
financial services such as buying travellers' cheques and foreign currency,
share dealing - even paying utility and credit card bills.
The organisation which runs Switch has ended its own rules against using the
card for financial transactions, having been satisfied that security
procedures are tough enough to prevent fraud.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Time limits on a Pep
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have a self-select general Pep. At the moment, it consists of Pounds
17,000 equities and Pounds 10,000 cash. Some Pounds 6,000 of this cash was
added in early December (for 93/94). I am an active investor and will buy
and sell from time to time.
The plan managers, the stockbroking arm of a major bank, wrote to me on
December 20 1993 urging immediate investment of the cash. Otherwise, they
said, the Inland Revenue might declare the plan invalid.
The latest edition of The British Tax Reporter says the last Revenue release
on general Peps stated there was no limit to the time cash may be held in
the plan.
Please can you tell me who is right?
If the bank is right, could I sell all equities in the plan and keep the
cash in it? How long before the cash had to be re-invested, and what
percentage of it could be retained as cash in the plan?
If no - what proportion could be sold and how long before the cash released
into the plan had to be re-invested and what proportion of this could be
retained in the plan in cash?
The Personal Equity Plan Regulations 1989 (as amended) do not specify an
absolute time limit within which cash held by a plan manager must be
invested or reinvested. But failure to use available cash to make
investments within a reasonable time would be prima facie evidence that a
so-called personal equity plan was, in fact, a sham and that the investor
was simply trying to exploit the Pep legislation for tax-avoidance purposes.
People who prefer cash to equities should put their money in a tax-exempt
special savings account, not a Pep, and must accept the Tessa restrictions.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax liability on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am very unclear on the tax liability on dividends paid gross by offshore
companies to UK residents. Are these taxed at 20 per cent as UK companies,
or at 25 per cent?
Also, for a higher-rate taxpayer, is the additional tax due on a UK company
dividend (on which there has been a tax credit of 20 per cent) an additional
15 or 20 per cent of the grossed-up figure?
Taking your questions in reverse order.
The additional charge for a higher-rate taxpayer is at 20 per cent: ie. 40
per cent minus the 20 per cent tax credit. Foreign dividends are taxable at
20 per cent (subject to any credit due in respect of tax charged in the
country of origin) in the hands of basic-rate taxpayers, except for those
taxpayers who are assessable on the remittance basis (Irish dividends being
excluded from this exception).
As with UK dividends, higher-rate taxpayers are chargeable at 40 per cent.
Section 77(2) of the Fianance Act 1993 says: 'The section 207A inserted in
the Taxes Act 1988 by sub-section 1 above shall apply, as it applies to
income chargeable under Schedule F, to any income which:
(a) is chargeable under Case V of Schedule D;
(b) is such that, being a dividend or other distribution of a company not
resident in the United Kingdom, it would be chargeable under Schedule F if
the company were so resident; and
(c) is not such that the tax is chargeable by virtue of section 65(5)(b) of
that act on the full amount of the actual sums received in the United
Kingdom.'

During the financial year 1992/93, I worked in the health service. I used my
own car on my employer's business and was paid a mileage allowance. For the
first half of the year I used a car of 1993cc, and for the second half one
of 2993cc.
On changing my car, I learnt I was being assessed under rates agreed between
'the Revenue, the health service and the Whitley Council' and not the fixed
profit car scheme (FPCS). As a result, I have incurred a taxable profit of
more than Pounds 300 for the larger-engined vehicle, even though my mileage
payment was slightly below the top 'tax-free' rate under the FPCS.
My tax office has told me the rates applying to the health service are not
negotiable and that the only alternative is to ask to be assessed on a
'statutory' basis. Is there any redress?
The FPCS is a voluntary scheme which employers may choose, if it suits them.
It is not open to an employee to claim the benefit of the FPCS if his
employer has not chosen to operate it. 'Statutory basis' means you have to
make a detailed claim for expenses and capital allowances, based upon an
analysis of your daily use of the car.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Doubts over Florida legacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am a beneficiary under the will of a US citizen (resident in the state of
Florida) who died in February last year. His assets were held almost
entirely in US securities, in a trust.
The trustees have told the beneficiaries that the securities have been sold
and the cash will soon be distributed.
They point out, however, that 57 per cent of the total is long-term capital
gains, and the tax liability will be distributed to each beneficiary in
proportion.
I understand that, as a UK citizen and resident, I am exempt from US tax.
Will I be liable for British capital gains tax?
On the bare facts given, it looks as though what you will acquire from the
trustees (under section 71(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992)
is a portion of the balance in the trustees' bank account on the day on
which you first have 'the exclusive right, subject only to satisfying any
outstanding charge, lien or other right of the trustees to resort to the
(balance) for payment of duty, taxes, costs or other outgoings, to direct
how that (balance) shall be dealt with.'
Broadly speaking, you will be liable to CGT only if the rate of exchange on
that day differs from the rate on the day of disposal by a sufficient
margin, after indexation relief, to bring your total chargeable gains for
the year above Pounds 5,800.
Ask your tax office for the free booklet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an
introduction), which should make the general principles clearer to you.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: . . . and picking the best provider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equitable Life's position as a major pension provider is undisputed, both in
the individual and company markets, writes Debbie Harrison. It has a
reputation for high-quality, high-performance products geared towards the
more affluent investor who can afford above average premiums. It was founded
in 1762 and is the oldest mutual life office in the world.
Yet there is something unusual about the office - a certain aloofness that
has characterised its standing in the pension market for more than 230
years. The attitude of rival life offices and independent advisers towards
Equitable is similar to that of the rest of Europe to Switzerland: a mixture
of sour grapes and admiration.
Take its sales strategy. Equitable's aim is to deal personally with the
pensions needs of managers, the self-employed, executives and directors. It
may sound elitist but it is a formula that has worked for more than two
centuries. Other life offices have sold through direct sales, independent
advisers, tied agents or a combination of all three, depending on the
prevailing fashion.
Equitable does not pay sales commissions to third parties and sells most of
its products through its relatively small (375) salaried sales force. Seven
per cent of its business is derived from other professional advisers but
they do not receive any payment from the society.
Roy Ranson, chief executive, says: 'The board first rejected a request to
pay commission in 1765 and has never found its payment necessary in order to
attract new business. By refusing to pay commission, we maintain strict
control over our business and the quality of service.'
The flagship of Equitable's personal pension range is its with-profits plan
which has produced consistently good returns over the past 20 years. This is
a mixed, actively-managed fund which, at the end of 1992, comprised fixed
interest securities (27 per cent), UK equities (41 per cent), overseas
equities (11 per cent), property (9 per cent), and 12 per cent in other
investments such as cash and index-linked gilts.
The strength of the with-profits product is that a proportion of the annual
investment return is paid in the form of guaranteed bonuses which, once
added, cannot be taken away.
Each year, Equitable announces a 'yield' on the fund, part of which is
guaranteed, while the remainder is non-guaranteed and confirmed only if the
policyholder wishes to terminate the plan or retires.
Ranson says recent criticisms of the performance of with-profits policies,
compared with unit-linked funds, are 'nonsense.'
'With-profits funds should be looked at over a rolling three to five-year
period and not judged on an annually,' he says. 'Although the aim of the
fund is to smooth investment returns to investors, there are bound to be
peaks and troughs in the short term. It is always easy with hindsight to
spot a specialised unit-linked fund that has done better.'
Moreover, Ranson reaffirms the long-term view of pension planning. 'It's no
good switching all your assets every year to a new provider, not if you want
to sleep at night.'
Under the unit-linked personal pension, in which contributions are invested
in units that reflect directly the value of the underlying fund, the society
offers 16 funds, ranging from low-risk gilt and fixed interest to the
higher-risk Far Eastern fund.
Long-term performance varies. The top scores are from the high income,
international, Far Eastern, fixed interest and money funds. However, the
managed fund - the most common choice for unit-linked clients - got off to a
good start in 1988 but slowly declined over the following four years, until
its recent improvement in 1993 when it bounced back into the top quartile.
Elsewhere in the pensions market, Equitable is a leading provider of
in-house additional voluntary contribution (AVC) schemes and is very
competitive on annuity rates. The society also offers clients a range of
annuity products which have particular appeal to the active investor.
One of the problems of personal pensions and similar products is that, on
retirement, the individual has to use the accumulated fund immediately to
buy an annuity which, normally, provides a fixed income for life since it is
invested in fixed-interest gilts. The annuity, once purchased, cannot be
changed.
To combat this problem, Equitable sells both unit-linked and with-profits
annuities which allow clients to continue to hold their pension fund
investments in real assets.
As a further development, the society launched its managed annuity in
October 1993 - the first of its kind - which allows investors a greater
degree of control over their annuity fund than is possible under
conventional contracts.
The continued active investment, particularly in equities, aims to provide a
better income in the long term. However, these products are complex and
require both expert advice at the outset and careful management over the
long-term.
The charging structure on Equitable's pension policies, devised in 1956 with
the launch of its first individual pension product, is central to the
society's 'flexibility without penalty' philosophy and provides a blueprint
for modern plans.
Each contribution is treated as a single premium and, therefore, future
contributions can be reduced, stopped and restarted without any penalty.
The modest charging structure puts Equitable among the top 10 leaders in the
industry in terms of value for money, according to statistics published in
the Financial Times Personal Pensions 1994 handbook.
Over the next decade, Equitable will face greater competition as
professional advisers negotiate non- commission terms with more of the
mainstream providers.
Nevertheless, in 1992 the society had the lowest expense ratio (management
expenses divided by total premium income) of all life offices, at 6.6 per
cent and less than half of the industry average (last calculated in 1991) at
19.3 per cent. The expense ratio is expected to fall to 5.8 per cent for
1993.
So far, Equitable has avoided any taint from the personal pension transfer
scandal in which individuals were advised wrongly to transfer benefits out
of company schemes.
The company has sold 37,000 transfer plans, a significant proportion of
which was not to employees in company schemes but to individuals
dissatisfied with the performance or contract terms of another provider's
plan.
Finally, Equitable looks good in terms of financial strength, receiving a
Standard &amp; Poor's AA rating.
S &amp; P says: 'Insurers rated AA offer excellent financial security. Capacity
to meet policy holder obligations is strong under a variety of economic and
underwriting conditions.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Personal pension plans . . . -
Insurance for life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal pensions represent the most significant development in the life and
pensions market in recent years, with more than 100 providers from which to
choose and 5m plans sold since their launch in 1988.
But after a six-year sales boom, worth billions of pounds, life offices have
been reprimanded for widespread mis-selling of transfer plans to employees
with company scheme benefits.
Over the coming weeks, the Weekend FT will examine these providers and the
quality of their products in terms of consistent investment returns and low,
flexible charges.
In this introduction to the series, Debbie Harrison explains what to look
for when choosing a provider and what pitfalls to avoid.
*****
Before taking out a pension you should take advice, preferably from an
adviser who accepts a fee rather than depending on a single product. These
advisers will arrange either enhanced terms with the provider or a rebate of
commission.
If the adviser is commission-based, the best arrangement is to pay a series
of single premiums, all at once or as a 'recurring single premium' (RSP)
contract. This should avoid high up-front commission costs, imposed on
contributions in the early days of a long-term, regular premium plan. These
result in hefty early termination penalties.
You should check the amount of commission and charges under an RSP contract
and make sure you are paying no more than you would under a one-off single
premium.
Not all of the providers covered in this series will offer products through
independent advisers, while some of those that do may not be prepared to
offer non-commission terms. In these cases, Weekend FT will provide details
of the sales channels used and the effect on commission, charges and quality
of advice.
Life office charges
In July, life offices are expected for the first time to provide
illustration of the net benefits of an investment, based on their own
charges. By 1995 this will be compulsory.
Until then, if you ask for an illustration of what your pension plan could
produce in, say, 20 years, providers will use standard charges devised by
the Life Association and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro). But
these are much lower than the industry average and serve little purpose
other than to lead you up the garden path.
Ian McKenna, a consultant with the independent adviser Blyth McKenna, says:
'Some advisers already have details of real charges on their computer
systems, but the present rules prevent us from showing them to clients. We
look forward to the day when we can give a clear statement of the real cost
of charges and how these impact on the total investment return, the value of
the policy at early termination, and at transfer.'
The Weekend FT, however, provides an example of actual charges in each
profile and compares these with the standard Lautro illustrations. As a
rough guide, providers with charges at or around the Lautro basis are likely
to offer good value for money.
The combination of a product having low or no commission with a low-cost
charging structure minimises the risk of financial penalty if you decide to
stop paying into the plan or need to transfer the fund.
One final point on flexibility: it is illegal under most circumstances to
belong to a company scheme and to run a personal pension. If you change jobs
and join the employer's scheme, you must stop your personal pension
contributions.
In these circumstances, watch out for the over-hyped feature of some
personal pensions that allows you to convert to a free-standing additional
voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan which acts as a top-up to the company
pension. This is often a ploy to encourage you to keep paying your premiums
to the life office. Few younger employees will be able to afford both
company and FSAVC contributions. FSAVCs are an excellent idea but should not
be a condition of stopping payment to the personal pension plan.
Performance
Look for consistency: over a period of five or 10 years, an outstanding
result in one 12-month period can disguise an otherwise lacklustre
performance.
Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of the partnership pensions section of the
actuary, Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Probably the best guide to future
performance includes the use of past performance statistics with a clear
understanding of how past performance was achieved; an assessment of the
present investment style of a management team; and a knowledge of whether
the individuals responsible for past performance are still in place.'
Financial strength
The company's status is noted in the fact file. Mutual life offices do not
have shareholders and are owned by their members. They cannot go to the
stock market to raise capital as can proprietary offices.
But status - whether mutual or proprietary - is no real indication of
financial position. The FT profiles use the Standard &amp; Poor's UK life
insurer financial strength rating, which is an opinion of the insurance
company's financial capacity and flexibility to provide present and
potential future policyholder benefits.
The triple-A rating indicates that the company offers 'superior financial
strength on an absolute and relative basis.' AA is 'excellent' while A is
'good'.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: How to build order, and profit, from
chaos - Bernice Cohen's share portfolio benefits from gauging the disorderly
mix that makes up market behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNICE COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The experiments of market operators who apply complex, mathematics-based
computer techniques to their trading were described in the Weekend FT
recently* by Clive Cookson.
As a do-it-myself investor, I cannot hope to apply these concepts with
similar rigour. Nevertheless, in my own efforts to research and manage the
family share portfolio, I have been trying to incorporate an amateur
equivalent of their approach for some time.
My system is not infallible, and the relationship between mathematical chaos
theories and a private investor's use of charts of historic data to predict
stock market performance may often be be more illustrative than scientific.
But it helps me to gauge the disorderly mix that makes up market behaviour.
Mathematical chaos theory is the science of irregularity in nature. It
explores unpredictable behaviour that is governed by simple rules. This
sounds contradictory, but the weather offers numerous illustrations. The
physical mechanisms producing hurricanes follow recognisable patterns
because of the physics of convection currents, but it is still difficult to
predict detailed timing in any specific occurrence. Accordingly, weather
forecasters use charts showing areas of high and low pressure.
While I always use fundamental analysis when making investment decisions, I
also study charts of stock market indices and individual share prices to
detect the repeating patterns that I believe depict chaos in the markets.
These patterns reflect the recurring mass behaviour of investors, just as a
temperature chart monitors fever in a patient.
Computers map nature's irregularities including coastlines, mountain ranges
or lightning. These maps, or 'fractals', reveal the geometry of
irregularity. They expose the pattern and order within apparent disorder. By
following millions of separate routes repeatedly, the computer reveals in
graphics the geometrical nature of chaotic systems. This applies equally to
financial markets.
Charts record a time series of numerous individual prices which share many
features with computer-generated fractals. I use a range of moving averages
 -such as those over 20, 50 and 200 days to help me decide when to buy or
sell. This is because moving averages smooth the randomness of the share
price series and distil out the underlying trend.
Following the trend helps me to profit from market movements. Strong trends
develop because share prices, like other chaotic systems, are prone to
lengthy positive feedback loops.
Share price rises encourage more buying and further price rises, in a
positive loop. As the loop repeats itself, a trend becomes established,
propelled by its own momentum. Prices are pushed ever higher, but the trend
grows increasingly unstable until profit-taking changes the direction of the
feedback loop abruptly.
Heavy selling brings out more sellers and falling prices stimulate further
selling, going around the positive loop again but, this time, in reverse.
Big profits can be made by staying with a prolonged rising trend, but it is
equally important to anticipate the turning point.
Some patterns give clues to the timing of major turning points because they
indicate a change of sentiment by a large group of investors.
If, as I think, the charts give a portrait of chaos operating in the
markets, then it is not surprising that recognisable patterns occur
repeatedly, as chaos theory shows that pattern and irregularity are
intermixed in chaotic systems.
We cannot expect to understand the cryptic messages in a Picasso painting
unless we study it in depth. Similarly, we must study the jargon of chaos
and technical analysis to profit from an understanding of chaos in the
markets.
One of the most fascinating aspects of chaos science is the concept of
strange attractors. These are pathways that describe the long-run behaviour
of an ever-evolving chaotic system as it changes over time.
They are called 'strange' because they emerge only with chaotic systems, and
they are 'attractors' because they attract stray points back towards them so
that, although the actual route of any one point can never be forecast
accurately, the strange attractor marks out the limits within which all the
unpredictability is contained.
Ironically, therefore, the strange attractor reveals the order within the
disorder. I think certain chart patterns with strange-sounding names, such
as head-and-shoulders or double tops, are examples of strange attractors in
the stock market and that is why they offer guidance on future price
movements. It cannot be a coincidence that most examples of 'bubbles' - from
the famous South Sea Bubble of 1720 to the recent Tokyo Nikkei Bubble of
1986-1993 - have chart patterns that are either head-and-shoulders or double
tops.
As American investors rushed into the Pacific Rim's smaller markets last
autumn, the strength of the resulting positive feedback loop was clear to
see. Now the charts, especially for Hong Kong and Malaysia, show the
left-hand side of the bubble pattern in formation.
Courageous investors probably will hang on until a complete head and
shoulder or double-top pattern emerges and then bail out swiftly. Since I
was in those markets before they began rising strongly in October, I am
almost completely out now; I get squeamish about excessive heights.
I believe these repeating chart patterns are the nearest thing we have to
chaotic strange attractors. Unfortunately, there is the usual cautionary
warning when making important investment decisions.
Sometimes, the patterns fail to follow through to the expected conclusions.
But that should be no surprise, as they are examples of chaos - and knowing
when the odd random event will render the forecasts invalid is the essence
of dealing with a chaotic system.

There are several non-mathematical books for interested readers giving a
brief history and description of the science of chaos. These include James
Gleick's 'Chaos' (Penguin, 1988); Ian Stewart's 'Does God Play Dice?'
(Penguin, 1990); and 'The New Scientist Guide to Chaos,' edited by Nina
Hall.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest single transaction of the week was recorded in Perpetual, the
unit trust and discretionary portfolio management company. Martyn Arbib, the
chairman, sold 300,000 shares at Pounds 10.80.
However, the stocks have been performing extremely strongly recently and he
still retains the lion's share of the company.
Kenwood Appliances, famous for their mixers, came to the market in June 1992
and first featured on this list in November last year. Since directors
started selling then at 316p, the shares have actually continued to rise and
are currently trading around 389p. This week's sales were slightly higher at
393p.
Filofax keeps cropping up as a company in which directors are still prepared
to invest, despite the share price racing ahead.
Whether the company merits such a high rating, even given its product's
global development prospects is hard to judge. Such a high degree of
director confidence is surely worth monitoring.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: More help for taxpayers - A new
form-filling service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumblings over the Inland Revenue's shift towards a self-assessed tax system
are growing, and accountancy firms are beginning to respond with new
services. BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest, has made the latest
move by starting a fixed-fee tax return service aimed at personal taxpayers.
This follows the launch in November of a telephone-based tax return service
run by Fryer &amp; Co., a small accountancy firm based in Luton.
Binder also is thinking of opening tax shops similar to the H &amp; R Block
chain in the US and an equivalent in Australia. Several other accountancy
firms and tax advisers are considering similar moves.
The fuss has been generated by one of the most radical reforms of the
British system ever proposed, although it mirrors systems already in place
in countries such as Ireland and the US.
Known as 'self-assessment,' it is scheduled to begin in the 1996-97 tax
year. In essence, the onus is on taxpayers to complete their own returns,
calculate their own liability and pay the amount straight to the Revenue
rather than waiting for assessments by officials, as now.
The government's commitment to the system has been stressed in the past two
Budget statements, and consultation papers have long been circulating within
the tax profession. But some are not happy with what they see.
Frank Akers-Douglas, head of private client work for Binder, says the draft
versions of the new tax return run to about 19 pages, with some 26 pages of
accompanying notes. 'Our view is that more and more people will need help in
preparing their returns but are frightened to use accountants at present
because of the costs.'
Binder's service - which has been tested on existing clients - offers a
fixed fee for processing the return. This is based on a sliding scale
between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,200, depending on how many entries need to
be filled on the return. In addition, the firm will charge for professional
advice.
Privately, some Revenue officials dismiss what they see as scare-mongering
by accountants seeking to generate new business in the confusion caused by
the change.
There is no doubt that there will be more complications for taxpayers. On
the other hand, only about 9m will be involved. Those whose returns are
dealt with entirely through the pay-as-you-earn system should be unaffected.
Equally, the Revenue stresses that, under the new system, taxpayers can
still opt, as now, to file their tax returns without calculating their final
liability and get an assessment from the tax office.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Flexible friend - Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BURROWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling annuity rates have put flexible annuities under the spotlight. These
are a radical departure from the conventional annuity where the rate and
benefits are fixed at the start. So far, the only providers of flexible
annuities are Provident Life and Equitable Life.
A flexible annuity allows control over payments and, to some degree, over
the underlying investment. There is the option to take tax-free cash, with
the balance of the fund invested either in investment-linked or with-profits
pension funds. The annuitant receives his payments direct from the fund.
This contrasts with a conventional annuity where the life company invests
the capital on the annuitant's behalf and, in return, pays a guaranteed
income for life.
Benefits
One of the main disadvantages of a conventional annuity is that the benefits
have to be bought at outset. With the flexible version, there is normally no
need for guarantees and increases can be funded from investment growth,
which should offset the effect of inflation.
Conventionally, a spouse's benefits are bought at the start but there are
three options with the flexible annuity:
The surviving spouse can continue receiving income from the fund.
The remaining fund can be paid into an annuity.
The balance of the fund can be paid as a lump sum into the annuitant's
estate.
Since the surviving spouse probably will need an ongoing income, the ability
to continue taking the pension from the flexible annuity is an attractive
option.
Flexibility
Unlike conventional annuities, the flexible version allows the annuitant to
choose what level of income is paid each year. The only conditions are that
the minimum payout is 5 per cent and maximum is 15 per cent of the pension
fund.
Low annuity rates deter pensioners from buying one because the starting
annuity is fixed for life, but flexible annuities allow holders to start
drawing a pension without committing themselves to a low-yielding return.
The flexible annuity can be converted into a conventional annuity at any
time so, if rates rise, the annuitant can take advantage of the more
favourable levels.
Risk
There is no investment problem with conventional annuities, except for
with-profits and unit-linked annuities, but flexible annuities will be
exposed to considerable investment risk. The fund value will fall if the
income taken out exceeds fund growth.
This is not a major concern if the difference is small because an annuity
is, after all, a sinking fund. But if the annuitant lives for a long time,
there will be the risk of triggering an automatic conversion  - if the fund
is not sufficent to provide the minimum annuity allowed, then it will be
used to buy a conventional one.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: When 'arrogance' pays - Joanna
Slaughter talks with fee-based adviser Murray Noble. Second in a series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fee-based independent financial advisers were rare birds when Robert
Noble-Warren founded Murray Noble in 1976. Indeed, he would argue that they
had scarcely emerged from the egg.
He says: 'In 1976, I had an idea of what should be provided 10 years on, but
there was no one to copy. We were ahead of the Financial Services Act; we
were disclosing commission before anyone was talking about it; and we were
also charging fees before anyone was talking about it.'
Keivan Borhani, Murray Noble's managing director, agrees. 'We are arrogant
pioneers,' he says. Unlike many pioneers, however, Noble-Warren has not
received a quiver full of arrows in his back. On the contrary. He has 300
clients, and eight years of hard work has confirmed his belief in the value
of fee-paying financial advice, which concentrates on solutions rather than
selling products.
He argues: 'From a client's point of view, the rationale of a fee-based firm
is that we can be free to explore solutions that don't involve
commission-based products. And you then find that the solutions are much
wider. Only about 20 per cent of the work we do is involved with a product.
If commission is paid, we don't regard it as our own. We ask clients what
they want to do about it.'
But what of the argument that people are not prepared to pay for fee-based
financial advice? Borhani replies: 'Once you can demonstrate value, we have
not found any resistance to paying fees. I think it is more commercially
viable to go down the fee-based route. It is not so capital-intensive; you
grow more slowly; and you have time to build a relationship, as you have to
be able to answer for every piece of advice you give in two or three years'
time.'
Unlike some fee-based advisers, Murray Noble is not content to trawl only
the ranks of the wealthy to find clients. Its aim is to bring its service to
ordinary people, although this broad ambition is still some way from being
realised.
'We don't look at a client and say: what is your wealth?' Borhani explains.
'We say: what is your problem and how can we help? We have miners in Wales
and retired couples who think that financial planning is worthwhile for
them. What we don't yet have is sufficient volume to bring the prices down.'
Murray Noble's fees for financial planning range from Pounds 75-95 an hour,
while administrative advice costs Pounds 35. If the financial need is a
common one, however, clients will be quoted a set fee. Noble-Warren says:
'If people have a retirement income question mark in mind, for example, we
can do a fixed fee service for anything between Pounds 400 and Pounds 800,
depending on the complexity of the case.'
The initial meeting with a client is free and is held at the Murray Noble
offices, which overlook London's Fleet Street. 'This first interview is for
us to get to know each other and to make our assessment and to see whether
we can help,' says Borhani.
Noble-Warren adds: 'It is very rare that someone says: what services are you
offering me? They say: I have a problem. I have inherited this money, or I
am about to retire, or my daughter has Down's syndrome.'
'They don't come here and say: plan me,' Borhani agrees. 'And, very often,
the needs we identify are very different from the things they consider they
need. That gets sorted out over the years.'
Couples are put under some pressure to attend the first meeting together,
although Borhani concedes this insistence on mutuality has caused problems
at times: 'On three occasions, the partners have subsequently divorced - and
then each of them has wanted to continue with the same planner.'
A barrister and a law graduate are among Murray Noble's four financial
planners. All the advisers have sat the examinations to become Associates of
the Institute of Financial Planning, and some have won awards: Noble-Warren
was Money Management's Financial Planner of the Year in 1992 and a
colleague, Joanna Stone, was Money Week's Independent Financial Adviser of
the Year in 1993.
The firm's strategy is to forge long-term relationships with its clients. To
do this, it offers continuing support and help on a retainer fee basis.
Should clients be made redundant, they receive the retainer service free for
two years, if necessary.
There are three levels of service:
The Executive (Pounds 60 a year) provides quarterly newsletters, sundry mail
shots and an annual tax and financial plan. This allows clients to alert
their planner to any changes in their circumstances.
The VIP (Pounds 150) offers all the benefits of the Executive service plus
an annual interview with an adviser.
The Directors' (Pounds 480) is the flagship. Borhani says: 'It is designed
for directors of companies and people who have quite complicated situations.
They have specific objectives and they need the help of a planner on a much
more regular basis.'
Services offered include tax advice and investment management, and clients
may receive a prod in the right direction if they need help that Murray
Noble cannot provide. Those who have not made a will, for example, will be
given the names of solicitors known to the firm.
Borhani's area is investment management. He runs four broker funds, 'our
planners will select them if the performance is good' and an advisory asset
monitoring service and says: 'We have planned portfolios. I think this was
the reason why there wasn't a single panic telephone call from clients at
the time of the Kuwaiti invasion.'
The firm's present strategy is to move away from investing in the
established, developed markets of the US, UK and Japan. Noble-Warren argues:
'The UK market just doesn't stand up compared with the risk/return you can
get elsewhere so, for some time, we have been steadily sailing on the other
tack, away from UK equities.'
Murray Noble has indemnity insurance for its professional activities and no
one in the firm handles client money. Noble-Warren says: 'If people are
buying a security, they will pay a cheque and their money will go straight
to the institution. We don't have a clients' account.'
On a more personal level, Noble-Warren says: 'I can't get on with people who
just come across as greedy. And I wish people would take money a little more
seriously, instead of reacting on the spur of the moment. They end up with
bits of products that don't match and don't do what they should.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A better model - The measure of
house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forecasting house prices can prove an embarrassment. The Household Mortgage
Corporation predicted a rise of 15.3 per cent in house prices for 1991/92.
The prices went steadily down. Now HMC has asked Loughborough University's
Economics department to devise a new model to predict changes up to two
years ahead. The first forecast looks realistic - a rise by the end of the
year of between 4 1/2 and 7 1/2 per cent.
What went wrong with the old model, produced by the Henley Forecasting
Centre for HMC in 1987? It worked well in the boom, said Jeff Wagland of
HMC, but could not cope during recession, partly because it did not take
enough account of the fall off in house building, nor of how the new homes
that had been built were clogging the market.
The Loughborough team has combined a number of indices, such as housing
starts, the unemployment rate and mortgage costs with 34 general economic
forecasts to provide its forecast.
These predictions do not include long-term demographic trends, such as the
growth of households which has been far faster - single mothers included -
than the growth of the population. But they can divide the country into
regions and predict that in the North West, where prices slumped later than
in the rest of the country, they will start to recover only in a year's
time. By then, in the South East a forecast average price of around Pounds
79,000 will have risen to a value which will once again equal the average
value of the mortgage.
They expect a rise of more than 6 per cent in the South East, South West and
East Anglia by 1995, and of less than 4 per cent in Wales, the North West
and the North. For the Midlands and Scotland they predict 4 to 6 per cent.
The HMC forecasts complement the Halifax and Nationwide price indices.
Halifax, the largest lender, is predicting that house prices will rise by 5
per cent during the year and Nationwide shares a similar view.
All three models measure a statistical mean - not actual bricks and mortar.
The two societies' indices take their data from the properties on which they
lend each month, breaking them down into basic characteristics (type, size,
number of bathrooms, central heating, arrangements for cars, etc) and rating
these statistically. These data are recombined to estimate what the
statistically average property that was the base in 1983 would cost now.
Why do the two indices differ, if both were started at 100 in 1983? Halifax
now stands at 201.3, Nationwide at 193.90. The differences are not so great
as the numbers suggest. The methodology of both indices is much the same.
And, since inception, their long-term trends agree startlingly well.
The different numbers reflect partly their different ways of measuring and
weighting.
Nationwide looks to the South and South East and measures by mortgages
approved - many of which will not be completed for a month or two, and some
not at all. But approved rather than completed mortgages, makes a useful
early indicator of trends. At the end of 1993, Nationwide was showing an
annual change of 3.3 per cent; Halifax 1.2 per cent.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Small business boost - Good news on
pensions for family concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension schemes for small family businesses received good news this week
when the Inland Revenue announced a measure to provide retired members with
extra flexibility and control over pension funds.
From February 4, members of small self-administered schemes (SSASs) will be
able to continue to control the investment of their fund well into
retirement, up to a maximum age of 75. This flexibility is not available for
individuals with personal pensions, executive pensions or those who are
members of 'money purchase' group pension schemes.
Small self-administered schemes became popular in the late 1970s and today
more than 30,000 businesses use a SSAS as their main pension arrangement.
Membership, normally restricted to a maximum of 12, can be extended to any
employee but generally is limited to a company's directors.
The schemes are unique to the UK and effectively allow small businesses to
retain a large degree of investment control over their pension
contributions. Provided Revenue guidelines are adhered to, it is possible to
use the pension fund to purchase new premises for the business and to
provide funding for loans or share investments in the company.
Although the pension under a SSAS is linked to the individual's final
salary, the fund grows on a money purchase basis and at retirement is used
to buy an annuity which provides regular income for life.
Annuity rates - that is the level of income the individual's pension fund
will purchase - are determined by the size of the fund, the individual's
life expectancy and interest rates, which currently are very low. SSAS
members who want to wait for higher interest rates and the better terms
offered to older people, will be delighted that the five-year limit on
deferment has been extended to any age up to 75.
During the deferment period, the retired scheme member will be able to draw
a pension income from the SSAS fund roughly equal to what would have been
paid by an annuity. Ian Hammond, managing director of James Hay Pension
Trustees, said: 'The individual will be able to live off the total
investment return, including interest and capital growth, of about 8 per
cent and virtually maintain the original full capital value.
'When he or she comes to buy the annuity at or close to the age of 75, even
if interest rates have not improved, the annuity rate will be that much
better since it will reflect the individual's decreased life expectancy.'
SSASs are extremely tax-efficient and offer considerable investment scope
including quoted stocks and shares, pooled investments such as unit and
investment trusts, cash funds, and commercial property. The company
directors, as scheme trustees, can select and control the investment
portfolio themselves or appoint a stockbroker to manage the fund.
Duncan Howarth, chief executive of GM Benefits Consulting Group, said: 'As
the trend towards fee-based advice accelerates, SSASs are proving
increasingly popular for directors of small companies who are looking for a
clear charging structure and the freedom to appoint an investment manager of
their choice or to construct a broad portfolio of funds to spread risk.'
Because it is an approved occupational scheme, employee and employer
contributions are tax deductible, the fund grows free of tax and can pay
death benefits of up to four times annual salary and, on a member's
retirement, a substantial tax-free cash sum. Spouse and dependants' benefits
are included, while the scheme can also provide a tax-free lump sum on death
during retirement. The pension, worth up to two-thirds of final salary
(restricted for some higher earners), is taxed as income.
Under Revenue rules you can only run one SSAS at a time, which makes the
choice of provider important. There are two main options. Fully
self-administered schemes generally are offered on a fee basis and are
available from about 60 firms of solicitors, actuarial consultants and life
offices. These organisations provide all the administration and legal
requirements, leaving you a free hand to appoint your own investment
manager.
The second option is a 'hybrid' SSAS offered by about 30 insurance
companies. Under this arrangement, a significant annual contribution -
usually about Pounds 5,000 in total - must be paid into an insurance fund,
while contributions in excess of this can be self-administered. The
insurance companies deduct a percentage of contributions paid into their own
funds and may have other fixed charges for investment management and
administration.
Hybrid SSASs, for which charges are levied on a percentage basis, are
generally thought to be more cost-effective for annual premiums of less than
Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the international financial information and news group, is
expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 435m for the year to
December 31, compared with Pounds 383m last time. Most interest will focus
on its plans for Quotron, the data service business it bought last month
from the US bank Citicorp, to expand into the North American equities
market.
British Petroleum is reporting its fourth-quarter results on Thursday.
Analysts expect after-tax profits of about Pounds 290m, although BP could
take a large exceptional charge for the restructuring of its European
chemicals division. That could amount to Pounds 200m or so after tax.
Profits on Monday from Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group, for the six
months to end-December, are likely to be little better than the Pounds 56.2m
pre-tax reported last year. Nevertheless a small increase in the interim
dividend is expected.
BOC shares missed out on the bull market of 1993 as sales of industrial
gases to recession-bound foreign markets slowed. First-quarter figures due
out on Thursday will also show the extent of damage done to the company's
healthcare division by by competition from generic alternatives to its big
selling anaesthetic gases. The City is expecting a pre-tax profit for the
first quarter of Pounds 75m (Pounds 90.8m), excluding a provision of Pounds
85m for restructuring announced last month.
On Friday, Lloyds Bank is expected to have raised full-year operating
profits marginally at best because income from securities and foreign
exchange were limited. Attention will be focused on the dividend following
two large increases from Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB Group. Analysts
predict dividend increases of at least 15 per cent from 18.4p in 1992, given
Lloyds' strong cpaital. Pre-tax profits are expected to rise to about Pounds
1bn, against Pounds 801m in 1992, with the bad debt charge falling from
Pounds 556m to about Pounds 350m.
British Telecom is expected to announce profits for its third quarter of
between Pounds 670m and Pounds 685m, against Pounds 705m. The fall will be
due to redundancy costs of about Pounds 150m (Pounds 17m) and an exceptional
charge of Pounds 56m for the premium paid to repurchase government-held
bonds.
Profits of about Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 5.61m), together with an unchanged
interim dividend of 0.2p, are expected when Amstrad reports interim results
on Thursday.

Credit card companies are engaged in a price war, giving consumers more
choice than ever before. Instead of simply looking to their own bank for a
card, they are almost as likely to apply to another lender.
Competition has been spurred by the arrival of new players - mainly from the
US - who are anxious to expand into Europe. In addition, issuers, hoping
people will start to borrow more as the economy comes out of recession, are
working ever harder to attract customers.
The main charges
Annual fees: These were unknown until 1990 when Lloyds imposed one. Now,
most issuers charge Pounds 10-12 a year. Many offer two types of card (for
example, Visa/Access and Mastercard) but charge only one annual fee. These
include Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Midland, Robert Fleming/S &amp; P and
National Westminster.
Interest rate: This usually is expressed in terms of an annualised
percentage rate (APR), making it easier to compare charges.
Most issuers charge interest for cash advances at a higher rate than for
purchases. Interest is charged either from the day the cash withdrawal is
made (even if you clear your account in full every month) or as a fixed fee,
usually of 1.5 per cent of the amount withdrawn.
Some issuers will try to attract new borrowers with incentives. The
Co-operative bank and the Leeds BS are among those which charge new
cardholders a lower rate of interest on debt transferred from their old
card. Others, including Barclaycard and Bank of Scotland, rebate a
percentage of the transferred debt as an incentive.
Interest-free period: It used to be standard practice to charge interest
from the statement date for those who did not settle their bill in full. But
most issuers now charge from the date the transaction reaches the account.
For those who pay off their balance in full every month, the maximum
interest-free credit period is 56 days. Some issuers have reduced this,
however.
Choosing the right card
Are you sure yours is the best for you, or should you switch to another
issuer? The answer is determined mainly by whether you pay off your bill in
full every month, or use the card to borrow.
Do you pay in full?
This is the best way to use a credit card since you are able to delay
payment for purchases without incurring any interest. This type of user need
not worry about the APR, and can concentrate on choosing a card with no
annual fee.
The table includes cards which do not have an annual fee; the large number
in Northern Ireland suggests that, off the mainland, annual fees have yet to
catch on.
Watch out for hidden drawbacks to no-fee cards. The Co-operative bank's
Robert Owen card carries a free-for-life pledge, but a Pounds 12 fee is
imposed if the card is used less than 10 times a year. The interest-free
period is just 46 days and the fee for cash withdrawals is higher than most,
at 2 per cent. Similar conditions are applied by Co-operative Retail
Services.
Some issuers, including Leeds, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, will
rebate the previous year's annual fee if you charge a minimum amount -
upwards of Pounds 1,500 - to the card each year. In any case, MBNA, the
international arm of a large US credit card-lender, is waiving its annual
Pounds 10 fee for the first two years and Ford Barclaycard is doing the same
for one year.
Do you use your card to borrow?
If you are going to incur interest on your card, the priority is a card with
a low APR (see table) and, ideally, one which charges interest from the
statement, rather than the transaction, date. Royal Bank of Scotland's
Mastercard has a 16 per cent APR (14.5 per cent on balances of Pounds 1,000
and over) and is aimed at those who borrow continually, since there is no
interest-free period.
Robert Fleming/S&amp;P was one of the first into the credit card battlefield,
reducing its APR to 14.6 per cent. But, like other card issuers offering
good deals, it is choosy about its customers. The few issuers to charge from
the statement date include Bank of Cyprus, Coutts, First Trust Bank (NI) and
Standard Chartered.
Using the card abroad
Convenience when travelling is an important selling point for many credit
card-issuers. But can 'flexible friends' really bend themselves to every
situation? Travellers in France have had their plastic cards rejected or
even swallowed by cash dispensers, automatic vending machines and stores
displaying clearly the Visa/Carte Bleu sign. The problem has arisen because
modern French credit cards incorporate a microchip to beat fraud while
British ones have only a low-tech magnetic strip.
Visa has been educating shops and restaurants in France about how to deal
with foreign cards but you could still encounter problems. If your card is
rejected, and your linguistic skills are up to it, you could explain that
foreign cards need to be swiped through a different slot on the electronic
terminal. Alternatively, the vendor can confirm your card's validity over
the telephone with the central processing office.
If systems elsewhere reject your Visa or Access card, the fault could be
with the magnetic strip but, again, the transaction can be confirmed by
telephone.
Exchange rates
Another problem with using credit cards abroad is that you have no control
over what exchange rate is used for the transaction. Card processors use the
rate applying when the transaction is posted to your account, which could be
anything from a few days to weeks or months after you use it.
The two main card systems, Visa and Mastercard, set their own exchange
rates, a fraction of a percentage point above the wholesale currency market
exchange rate. But the card issuer is free to add its own mark-up to the
basic exchange rate. This can be as much as 3 per cent. This might throw out
your budget calculations; even so, it is usually better than you might get
at tourist currency exchange counters.
Perks
The various perks being used by card issuers to attract custom range from
air miles (NatWest and Ulster Bank) and discounts on holidays booked through
a travel club (many issuers including Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank
of Scotland, AIB, Yorkshire Bank) to large rebates on new cars
(Ford/Barclaycard and GM Card/Vauxhall).
Perks should not generally be a deciding factor in your choice of card, as
only really big spenders tend to get the full benefit. Most systems award
you points for every Pounds 10 you spend.
To get the maximum Pounds 2,500 discount on a new Vauxhall by using the GM
card, for example, you would have to spend Pounds 50,000 over five years.
Likewise, to qualify for the full Pounds 1,800 Ford discount with
accumulated Barclaycard Profiles points, you would have to spend Pounds
36,000 over three years.
Profiles points also can be used on items in a catalogue. To qualify for a
set of five paintbrushes, you would need to spend Pounds 1,900. To take your
partner for a two-night Scottish break, you would have to rack up Pounds
25,000 and pay an extra Pounds 40.
The main function of points-based systems is to encourage people to use one
card rather than another if they have a choice, or to use a credit card
rather than debit card, cheque or cash.
Travel discounts through credit card holiday clubs do not rely on points but
they do restrict your choice of tour operator - you might still get a better
deal elsewhere.
Card protection plans
Losing a wallet full of plastic, through carelessness or theft, can be a
nightmare. Protection plans aim to simplify the process by registering all
your cards centrally so you call one number to cancel them all. They also
provide an insurance element, covering your liabilities if cards are used
fraudulently, and providing an emergency cash loan if you are stranded away
from home. Other services include a lost key return service and registration
of documents.
Protection plans usually are bought through one of the many card issuers but
the schemes themselves are run by two providers: CCP and Sentinel. The cost
ranges from Pounds 7-8 for one year, to Pounds 32 for five years.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Oil for industry's lamps, but at what price? - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil executives have argued for years that investors need to take a long-term
view of such a cyclical, commodity-based business. But they may be surprised
that the message apparently has been embraced at a time when a chorus of
caution about the uncertain short-term outlook for the industry is coming
from oil company boardrooms.
Crude oil prices, as measured by the benchmark Brent Blend, regained some
ground this week but, at around Dollars 14-15 a barrel, are still about
Dollars 4 down on last year, Yet, shares in the big, integrated companies
such as British Petroleum, Shell and Exxon have proved remarkably resilient.
The UK integrated oil sector outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index
by 9.42 per cent last year. Analysts expect to hear a similar message from
British Petroleum when it reports next Thursday, and from Shell Transport
and Trading/Royal Dutch Shell later in the month.
The rehabilitation of BP shares in the eyes of UK investors is a theme which
has carried over from last year. The company's troubled period following the
sudden departure in 1992 of chairman Robert Horton left UK investors wary
until well into 1993 when the twin themes of improved marketing margins and
successful cost-cutting led to a reversal of sympathy. But are such themes
durable and powerful enough to underpin the performance of BP and the other
oil majors if crude prices do not rise substantially?
BP officials told City analysts before Christmas that they were confident of
meeting their financial goals - based on average oil prices of Dollars 18 -
even if average prices slipped to Dollars 16. A report from Natwest
Securities this week suggested that BP was likely to exceed its target of
reducing costs by Dollars 1bn a year, with Dollars 700m accumulated in the
first three quarters of 1993.
Fergus Macleod, Natwest's oil analyst in Edinburgh, believes BP has been
particularly successful in squeezing suppliers, thus keeping capital costs
lower. But Paul Spedding, at Kleinwort Benson, the London broker, wonders if
cost-cutting can be maintained. 'After all, cost-cutting opportunities have
not got any greater,' he says.
Analysts believe BP's final results also will be clouded by a large
exceptional item of up to Pounds 200m after tax for restructuring its
troubled European chemical division, and the City will be looking
additionally for any erosion of marketing margins.
That would certainly send a warning signal to investors but Jeremy Hudson,
energy analyst at the London office of Lehman Brothers, the US investment
bank, believes longer-term factors may be shaping investor perceptions of
the sector. 'The present weak upstream results are not completely offset by
the improved refining and marketing margins,' he says. 'Yet, the shares have
outperformed their markets. That must indicate a change in the time horizon
of investors. We believe investors are sniffing a long-term recovery.' This
is based on the likelihood that the petrochemicals and metals divisions of
the integrated companies will move towards a new cyclical peak in 1998.
Nick Antill, at broker Hoare Govett, says an optimistic case for the
industry can even be made on the basis of oil prices as long as investors
took a 'very long-term view.' He notes that crude prices have declined over
12 years and that a long-term investor could probably expect more 'upside
than downside.'
Antill feels the general state of the world economy will be critical to the
sector's performance in coming months. But he is wary of dismissing the
possibility of even lower prices - and the shockwaves that could produce.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Shares plunge as the Fed loosens its lips - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So, the Federal Reserve decided to tighten monetary policy after all.
It was not a particularly dramatic move, just a nudging in the Federal funds
rate - the rate at which banks led money to each other - up from 3 per cent
to a new target of 3 1/4 per cent.
The Fed, however, was determined to make sure the financial markets got the
message, so in an unusual step, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, issued a
public statement explaining that the central bank's policy-making Open
Market Committee had voted this week to slightly tighten monetary policy.
This was most out of ordinary. Normally, if the Fed wants to change its
stance on policy (without resorting to the obvious move of an increase in
the discount rate) it allows the Fed funds rate to move up or down a few
percentage points. It then waits for the markets to work out the
implications of this move for themselves.
By explaining directly what the central bank was doing, Greenspanwas
delivering on the promise he made to Congress at the start of the week -
that the Fed would soon raise interest rates to keep inflationary pressures
in the economy in check.
The markets took the news badly. The Dow tumbled30 points after the Fed
announced its decision late yesterday morning, and ended the day 96 points
down - its biggest one day fall for more than two years.
Although bond prices at first held up relatively well, this was because
themarket had already experienced a sizeable sell-off earlier in the day
after the30-year government bond surrendered the one-point gain it had made
following a weaker-than-expected January employment report.
Later, however, they lostall their early gains as analysts and traders came
to grips with both the jobs figures and the Fed's move.
While the means by which the Fed communicated its actions was surprising,
the timing was not. All this week the expectation was building that a strong
January employment report on Friday would provide theFed with the perfect
reason to raise interest rates.
Anticipation of a Fed move heightened on Thursday because that morning the
central bank had taken no action to prevent the Federal funds rate - the
rate at which banks lend money to each other - from rising above its 3 per
cent target to 3 1/8 per cent. In thepast, when Fed funds have traded above
3 per cent, the Fed has added reserves to the banking system to bring the
rate back down to its target.
The Fed's inaction on Thursday was interpreted as a sign that the central
bank wanted theFed funds rate at 3 1/8 per cent. Yields on short- term
Treasury securities rose sharply on the belief that the Fed was setting the
stage for a tightening of itsmonetary policy screw.
The theory sounded so convincing because Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
had told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress at the start of the week
that the Fed was ready to tighten monetary policy.
After the chairman's warning, both stock and bond markets were watchful, and
as the week wore on, the announcement of employment figures on Friday
morning lookedmore and more like the event that would spur the Fed into
action.
Atfirst glance, however, it appeared that there was not enough ammunition in
the January employment report to load the Fed's gun.
While economists had been looking for a gain in monthly payrolls of 200,000,
the actual increase in January was only 62,000.
The reaction from bond traders was immediate: they pushed prices of
government securities sharply higher on the thinking that the Fed could not
raise rates after a weak employment report.
Nothing, however, is ever cut and dried when it comes to economic
statistics, and the January jobsdata came with the usual set of
qualifications. Economists said the figures were skewed by two factors - the
Los Angeles earthquake, and the very cold weatherconditions in the East -
which they believed made it difficult for companies to accurately report
payroll numbers last month.
It was also noted that while the headline figure was below expectations,
other important measures, such as the average work week and average hourly
earnings, were strong in January, suggesting that underlying conditions in
the labour market continue to improve.
It was these considerations, plus a desire to be seen as vigilant against
the threat of inflation, that probably persuaded the Fed to make its move
yesterday, and announce the first tightening in US monetary policy in almost
five years.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: The global interest rate winds blow - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ken Clarke, exhibiting powers of command and control beyond the dreams of
John Major, pushed a button in London on Tuesday. Seconds later, on an oil
platform 211 miles offshore of Aberdeen, curtains rolled back on a plaque
inaugurating BP's Bruce Field.
If only the chancellor could so deftly deal with the offshore pressures
afflicting London markets. In the US, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, told congress that US interest rates would have to rise. In
Germany, the Bundesbank, disturbed by a surge in money supply, postponed
hopes of a German interest rate cut.
Throughout the week, London equity and gilts marketsswung in these global
interest rate winds. Monday and Wednesday UK rate cuts were on the agenda
and stocks rose sharply. Tuesday, Thursday and yesterday cuts were off and
stocks dropped. Few other, if any, factors seemed to animate investors and
dealers.
The FT-SE 100 closed a net 28 points up on the week at 3475.4, reaching a
milestone along the way. Monday's close was the first time the Footsie, on
an inflation- adjusted basis, bettered its record set on the eve of the 1987
market crash. As the chart shows, equities have handsomely
outperformedgilts, inflation-adjusted, over the same period.
Inflation is dormant atleast, if not actually dead as politicians and some
economists would have us believe. Yet, a small cloud of inflationary chaff
blew through the markets late inthe week. Deploying its
'pushing-on-a-wet-noodle' style of command and control, the cabinet waved
through a wage settlement for 1.5m public sector employees. The increase,
some 50 per cent higher than the current rate of inflation, will cost the
government Pounds 1bn.
A smack of firmer guidance came, however, fromEddie George, governor of the
Bank of England. Prospects for sustained growth and gradual reduction in
unemployment were 'better than at any time' in his career, he told
banquetting bankers. Do not expect a rate cut, was the subtext his audience,
not to mention a wider market public, inferred.
But with due respect to UK authorities, it is the thoughts and imminent
actions of the Fed which are preying on the markets. Normally the Fed does
not tip its hand to the market for some time after its once-every-six-weeks
policy setting meetings. Yesterday, 24 hours after its latest meeting, it
did break the pattern with a highly unusual statement. It said it had
decided to tighten monetary policy via a 'smallincrease in short-term money
market interest rates.'
London and Wall Street stocks retreated instantly but moderately on the
news. What, though, will be the considered response? The overwhelming fear
has been that US investors, particularly retail rather than institutional,
would rapidly shift their perceptions and portfolios when the upturn in
interest rates came. The torrent of money flowing out of cash into equities,
particularly foreign ones, would be reversed.
'It is commonly argued that the current global bull market will be brought
to an end when US interest rates begin to rise because US retail investors
will start to sell equities. We regard this scenario as relatively
unlikely,' argue Sushil Wadhwani and Mushtaq Shah, two London-based
strategists of Goldman, Sachs.
Looking at the previous three troughs in US interest rates, they found that
individual investors continued to increase their ownership of equities for
some time after interest rates began to rise. Typically, six months after
the turn, investors have still only made some 10 per cent of the portfolio
shift they eventually make. In other words, it takes them a while to switch
their investment mantras from 'cash is trash' to 'cash is king'.
In such an upturn, equities will continue to outperform bonds thanks, in
part, to strong growth in corporate earnings which is kicking in at this
stage in the economic cycle. Moreover, European equity markets would gain
protection from their domestic flow of funds and from the more cautious
reactions of European investors.
The desire to pile into equities appeared to be borne out by the remarkable
UK investor response this week to two European privatisation investment
trusts launched by Mercury Asset Management and Kleinwort Benson. Together,
the funds are seekingsome Pounds 1.075bn. So far they have attracted Pounds
645m from institutions plus Pounds 880mand rising from individuals.
Cautious, slow responses were hardly the hallmarks of the main corporate
story of the week: BAe's decision to sell its 80 per cent holding in the
Rover car group to BMW for Pounds 800m of cash and Pounds 900m of debt
relief.
With speed and agility worthy of the cars they build, BMW executives slapped
an offer on the table. BAe, with equally impressive speed, headed for the
motor industry exit ramp. Honda, Rover's partner, saviour and 20 percent
shareholder, was left gasping in BAe's dusty slipstream.
The story appears to be far from over yet. Honda, with an impressively stout
leash on Rover through product and technology licensing agreements, could
extract a high price from BMW for its continuing co-operaton. BAe, liberated
from mundane terrestrial transport, has great new freedom to develop its
aerospace and defence interests.
The City, thrilled by BAe's prospects, sharply re-rated its stock. The
shares closed up 131p on the week at 575p. Others were sucked along in its
slipstream. Car part makers such as GKN, BAA and T &amp; N, for example, could
gain newbusiness from BMW's new British connection.
But the emotional fallout was heavy. With one push of the deal button,
ownership of the last British volumecar maker slipped offshore.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Questions for the multiple-choice Pep - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Readers will hear a lot about personal equity plans as the tax year draws to
a close on April 5. Many people leave their tax-planning measures to the
last minute so fund management groups wait until the last quarter to bombard
potential investors with new launches and discounts.
The annual maximum investment in a general plan is Pounds 6,000 in a tax
year and income and capital gains are tax-free. However, investors must have
a plan manager who will charge an annual fee.
The issue of charges has become most heated in the case of unit trusts. This
might seem a little strange at first, since charges on a unit trust Pep may
frequently be no higher than investing in the same trust direct. By
contrast, charges on an investment trust Pep tend to be higher than a direct
holding because the trust has to charge for the extra administration
involved.
However, unit trusts tend to be a more expensive way into the market than
investment trusts because investors typically face an initial charge of 5-6
per cent and an annual management fee of 1.5 per cent. The initial charge is
part of what is known in the jargon as the bid / offer spread - the
difference between buying units and selling them. A typical bid / offer
spread is about 6 per cent, but it can be wider.
Some unit trust companies have been reducing the initial charge on their
Peps but have introduced withdrawal charges on a sliding scale. A number of
stockbrokers will offer discounts on the initial charge for self-select Peps
or for execution only-unit trust deals.
This week, Skandia Life, has come up with a new twist for the launch of its
first non-insurance product. Its Multipep aims to allow the investor to
switch between a number of unit trusts at low cost.
How does it work? Skandia has pre-selected 30 funds, in the main for good
performance and for a spread between the UK and abroad, and capital or
income. You pay an initial charge for the Pep of 4.75 to 5 per cent, which
is lower than that on most unit trust Peps.
UK funds include: Fidelity Special Situations, Gartmore British and two
James Capel index funds - the Footsie and the Trixie; those in the European
sector include Baring European Growth, Henderson European Income, Morgan
Grenfell European Growth and another James Capel tracker fund, its Eurotrack
100 Index.
There are three ethical funds - Abtrust Ethical, Credit Suisse Fellowship
and Merlin Ecology - and one emerging market fund: Framlington Emerging
Markets. Investors can also choose from a number of US, far eastern, Global
and fixed interest funds. Most of the funds have good or excellent
performance, apart from the ethical trusts and some of the index-linked
trusts.
If, for example, you invest in Fidelity Special Situations through the
Multipep but later decide you wanted income rather than capital growth, you
could transfer to one of the income funds at a low initial charge of between
0.25 per cent and 0.5 per cent, instead of usual transfer charges of between
2 and 5 per cent. You can also switch temporarily to cash in the Pep.
There are disadvantages. Skandia imposes its own annual fee of 0.5 per cent
on top of the fee charged by the manager. This means that the total annual
fee will vary between 1.5 and 2 per cent. Over time, annual fees have much
more of an effect on performance than initial fees.
There is also a dividend collection charge which varies depending on the
number of dividends a year. The charges are for each dividend collection:
Pounds 5 if only one dividend is paid out; Pounds 4 each for two; Pounds 3
for four; and Pounds 2 for 12. If your chosen trust were to pay dividends on
a monthly basis and you took them all as income, you would pay Pounds 24 a
year.
Anomalies can also arise. A Fidelity Pep bought direct has a low initial
charge of 2 per cent and withdrawal fees. If you own Fidelity Special
Situations but want to transfer into Multipep within three years of taking
out the Fidelity fund, you could find yourself paying Fidelity's withdrawal
charges and an initial charge of 5 per cent for the Multipep, instead of the
2 per cent on direct purchases into the same fund. You could use a discount
broker to reduce the initial charge.
The strength of the Multipep is for those who envisage moving between funds.
How likely is this? Skandia Life argues that many investors feel locked into
one fund manager once they invest in a Pep but that over the longer-term,
they are likely to make a number of transfers because investment needs
change or the performance of funds drop.
Many people may say they are able to get good performance by choosing the
right fund at the outset and can achieve diversification by investing their
annual allowance in different funds. They may also argue that the choice of
funds in Multipep is restrictive, although Skandia says it will be adding to
them. Moreover, given the trend towards lower Pep prices, the annual charge
appears too high.
Nevertheless, Skandia gets full marks for a good idea.
Last week I wrote that Noble Lowndes' fine of Pounds 740,000 was for
switching people out of occupational schemes and into private pensions. In
fact, the fine was in no way related to this issue but was for unnecessary
switching and unsuitable advice in connection with investments. My apologies
for the error.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Tokyo market rebounds - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market rebounded at the beginning of this week on news that
the parliament had passed the coalition government's political reform
package. This opens the way for further economic stimulus measures. However,
the Nikkei index is still at about half its peak level.
Fidelity is launching its second UK investment trust, Fidelity Japanese
Values, to specialise in Japanese smaller companies. Simon Fraser, manager
of the trust, says smaller companies should benefit from the economic
recovery, and deregulation and other structural changes in the Japanese
economy could also provide them with new opportunities. The public offer
period runs from February 22 to March 8. There will be one free warrant
attached to every five shares.

The fragility of the housing market was emphasised this week by Halifax, the
largest lender, which found that house prices fell 0.4 per cent last month
compared with December, although they are up in the year to January.
However, Nationwide, the second largest building society, produced figures
showing that prices rose on average by 0.4 per cent in January. The
standardised average house price has risen from Pounds 60,471 in January
1993 to Pounds 61,133 last month, according to Halifax.

FT  05 FEB 94 / The Long View: Weight of money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money on the move can be an awesome sight. This week it has again been
pushing stock markets rapidly higher, with the FT-SE 100 Index topping the
3,500 level at one stage. It seems that equities can only go up and up and
up; but across the Atlantic the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan
Greenspan, yesterday threatened to spoil the party by announcing his
long-awaited move to push up dollar short-term interest rates.
His move comes amid clear signs of excess demand for financial assets around
the globe. Look, for example, at the way money is cascading into investment
trusts in the UK. The Tweedledum and Tweedledee European privatisation
trusts being launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management are
each on course to raise around Pounds 500m. Elsewhere, the existing Fleming
Japanese trust is seeking almost to double its size to over Pounds 500m, by
exploiting the fact that its share price has moved to a premium over
underlying assets.
Most of the time shares in these closed-end funds are available at a
discount because of chronic oversupply. But at periods like the present
people are so desperate to get out of cash that they cannot tolerate the
delay and inconvenience of buying particular investments - whether
individual shares, or assets like property or gold. Instead they pay a
premium for quick entry to indirect investment vehicles.
Demand, however, creates supply. Not only are the investment fund promoters
working overtime but the company flotation pipeline is full. In the queue
for a London listing are Alpha Airports, Ashanti Goldfields, House of
Fraser, Beazer and a whole lot more.
I never fail to be astonished at the shifts in the balance of financial
power between the end of one economic boom and the beginning of the next
recovery - even though the changes are predictable. In the late 1980s the
banks were financing a string of immense corporate transactions whereby
companies were changing hands at twice the stock market price. Today the
banks are cowed, and the stock market is carrying all before it. Normally I
would trust the stock market on price, but today we are moving into
dangerous territory.
The figures are remarkable. In 1989, the most extreme year, British
industrial and commercial companies spent Pounds 26bn on the securities of
other companies at home and overseas in a massive takeover spree. In all
they borrowed Pounds 34bn from banks that year. For last year we only have
nine months' figures, but on an annualised basis the purchase of securities
was down to Pounds 4bn and over Pounds 11bn was repaid to the banks.
There are few takeover bids going on at present other than for special
reasons, as amongst the ITV contractors. Instead companies are spinning off
subsidiaries for what they see as temptingly high prices: Alpha is the
airport catering side of Forte, while Hanson is proposing to float Beazer
into a buoyant UK housebuilding sector.
Formerly empire-building chief executives are at last forced to recognise
that investors actually want clearly focused companies to invest in rather
than rambling conglomerates. British Aerospace has this week trumpeted the
merits of concentrating on its core activities rather than arguing, as it
did five years ago when it bought Rover, that making cars was much like
making planes. But the acquisitive tycoon's minis-to-jumbos philosophy is
right out of fashion. The FT-SE Mid 250 index of medium-sized companies
outperformed the Footsie index of the 100 biggest blue chips by some 12
percentage points in 1993 and it has already shown a relative gain of 7
points in 1994 so far.
But if takeovers are out, expansion by direct investment in new productive
assets surely ought to be in. The cost of capital to listed companies has
tumbled: the average dividend yield is little more than 3 per cent, the
average earnings yield is just 5.6 per cent on the basis of expected 1993
profits. Although more complex formulae are used by corporate planners,
equity capital has certainly become cheaper. But fixed capital investment
continued to fall last year in the UK, for the third year in a row. The
January CBI opinion survey at least showed that on balance companies are now
expecting to increase their capital spending over the next year but the
positive tilt is still only small.
The puzzle here is whether there is a lot of spare capacity in the British
economy or not. Economists are all over the place on this point, because
nobody knows how much old capacity has been closed or is unusable. At any
rate there is a mismatch between the sudden enthusiasm of investors, who are
pouring money into the securities markets, and the caution of company
executives still influenced by the recession. It takes time to shift your
priorities from survival to growth. According to the CBI survey British
companies are keener to raise prices than increase their capacity: old
habits die hard. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing, meanwhile, though
not exactly high, is above the historical average level, the survey
suggested.
If the money pouring into equities is not in due course matched by an
expansion of the productive and profit-generating assets owned by companies
then it is inevitable that shareholders will end up losing heavily. In
economic terms the bursting of a market bubble is a mechanism for wiping out
wealth. There is a clear warning here from the bankers' unfortunate
experiences of the late 1980s when they too poured billions into financing
overpriced deals involving corporate assets or real estate and often wound
up with huge bad debts.
The extraordinary popularity of the privatisation trusts may reflect the
perception of investors that one of the few havens of fair value is found in
corporate assets newly available through privatisation. It could be a better
idea than chasing existing shares still higher. But not at a big premium -
certainly not when the Fed has signalled a possible new phase for the global
market.

FT  05 FEB 94 / The future of Auschwitz: Christopher Tyler visits the
extermination camp where Nazis killed a million people and asks how it can
fulfil conflicting functions as memorial, museum and, increasingly, tourist
attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty years ago this month a young chemist called Primo Levi was marched
through the gate inscribed Arbeit Macht Frei, stripped, shaved, tattooed,
dressed in stripes and clogs, and thus reduced to an Untermensch, a starving
slave worker of the Thousand-Year Reich.
Hitler's war was already as good as lost when Levi and 650 other Italian
Jews were deported in cattle trucks to Auschwitz in Poland. On arrival, 29
of the women were admitted to Birkenau camp. Of the men, 96 were sent to
work at Monowitz sub-camp where IG Farben, the German industrial
conglomerate, was trying to produce synthetic rubber at a slave-built
factory. The rest of that night's consignment - men, women and children -
were taken directly to the Birkenau gas chambers.
Because of his chemistry degree and his later confinement for scarlet fever
Primo Levi survived until liberation in January, 1945, to emerge a
devastatingly eloquent witness to the crime which still defies human
comprehension. Levi's testimony is not only eloquent but has proved exact in
all but a few details, according to Piotr Setkiewicz, a young Polish
historian from the Auschwitz museum.
The testimony of Levi, who committed suicide seven years ago, remains as one
kind of memorial to the 1.1m to 1.5m people, 90 per cent of them Jews, now
estimated to have been gassed, shot, hanged, starved or simply worked to
death at Auschwitz.
Another kind of memorial is Spielberg's film Schindler's List, the story of
Oskar Schindler, the Sudeten-Czech entrepreneur who saved 1,100 Jews in a
small camp in nearby Krakow. The film, which crosses the Atlantic later this
month, will reach a wider audience even than the recently-opened Holocaust
museum in Washington, DC. It will probably be seen by more westerners than
have ever read about, let alone visited, Auschwitz or the other Nazi
extermination camps in Poland.
But what is to be done with Auschwitz itself? As the camp's few survivors
die out, one kind of memory dies with them. But recollections alter,
meanings conflict and the camp symbolises quite different things to Jews and
Poles, to Russians, Gipsies - not to mention the Germans themselves. The
problem of reconciling historical accuracy with present sensitivities and
future instruction creates for the caretakers of Auschwitz what has been
called the greatest conservation challenge in Europe.
Should Auschwitz be restored to what it was or preserved as it is (including
such post-war reconstructions as the small gas chamber in the base camp)?
Should it be developed in some way, or left decently to decay? These
questions have assumed added importance today because the re-writers of
history, the Holocaust-denial specialists, are riding the crest of a new
wave of neo-Nazi racism in Europe. They are likely to seize on any
'distortion' of Auschwitz.
Levi's camp at Monowitz has virtually disappeared, although the factory
beside it is working to this day (it produces synthetic rubber for the
Polish state). The solid, pre-war barracks of the main lager, Auschwitz I,
with its execution yard, medieval torture cells and gibbets, stand intact.
But for Poles, especially under Communist rule, Auschwitz I is primarily the
place where 75,000 of their compatriots died, a memorial to Resistance
heroism or Catholic martyrdom because it served first as a concentration
camp for political prisoners, some of whom, only incidentally, were Jews.
Until five years ago (and in line with the current ideology) the museum
guidebook referred only to the murder of 'people', not Jews.
Birkenau, 3km away and built in 1941-2, presents the other face of
Auschwitz. Seen from the guard house tower on a misty winter's evening, the
camp seems to stretch for ever: more eloquent than the 60-odd preserved
wooden huts in the foreground are the rows of skeletal chimneys of hundreds
more huts that have long since rotted away.
A railway spur, laid in 1944 to expedite the last frenzy of genocide, runs
innocently up and through the central archway of the long, red-brick facade.
It proceeds down the middle of the 425-acre field to terminate beside an
earth platform. A few yards further on, behind a screen of poplars, lies
what is left of four gas chamber / crematoria, whose exploded remains were
left by the SS as they fled the advancing Russians. Behind the crematoria
again are ponds where human ashes were dumped and pits where corpses were
burned when the ovens became overloaded.
Here, the Jews driven to their deaths had no chance to be 'martyrs' nor
resistance fighters, only victims. While Auschwitz I illustrates SS
brutality and perversion, at Birkenau it is the scale of the Nazi crimes
that becomes apparent: the euphemistic, bureaucratic, systematic and
industrialised slaughter known as the Final Solution.
Auschwitz has to fulfil three functions, according to the Oxford historian
Jonathan Webber, who is a founder member of the International Auschwitz
Council set up in 1990 to advise the Polish authorities. It is a place of
mourning, being the largest cemetery in the world; it is a museum of record;
it is also - inevitably and increasingly - a tourist attraction.
Of the resulting conflict there have been many examples, large and small.
The arrival of a group of well-meaning Catholic nuns to pray for the souls
of the dead in a building at the first camp (outside the original wire, but
within the wider complex) led to an international incident. After five years
of dispute, the nuns were rehoused a few hundred yards away in 1992. Some
Jews were hurt by the Pope's beatification of Edith Stein, a Jewish woman
who converted to Catholicism and became a nun: she was gassed in 1942 not
because she was a nun but because she was Jewish, they say. Others find
offensive the museum display of seven tonnes of women's hair and the cloth
into which it was woven by German factories. They say it should be decently
buried. For similar reasons survivors blocked a proposal to dig a section
across the field of ashes and line it with glass to demonstrate the awful
depth of the human remains.
It has taken the council three years to recommend new wording for plaques on
the modern monument erected at the end of the Birkenau railway line. These
were erased because they quoted a false Russian estimate of 4m Auschwitz
victims and made no specific mention of the Jews. But which of the many
nationalities were now to be recorded, in which order, and in what
languages?
Today's visitors bring further problems. Dr David Cesarani, director of the
Wiener Library in London, is worried by the apparent incomprehension shown
even by Israeli and Jewish-American children when they tour the camps.
'They've not quite - what shall I say - got the hang of it,' he said. Jewish
schools were teaching children about the Holocaust, Piotr Setkiewicz said,
but in an emotional way that did little to explain the ideology behind it
nor the war that facilitated it. The museum has asked the Polish minister of
culture to set a minimum visiting age of 14.
Even adults seem confused, according to Wanda Hutny, head of the museum's
education department. She described how Americans arrive in coach parties,
dressed in shorts and T-shirts, take a few snaps of each other in front of
the crematorium chimney and jump back on the bus. Japanese visitors, when
confronted with the 'wall of death', are seen to smile - the Oriental way of
showing discomfort but shocking to any westerners who may be with them. One
day, a nosegay of flowers was found under the gallows where the Auschwitz
commandant Rudolf Hoss was hanged after the war. It might have been a
neo-Nazi gesture, or an innocent mistake.
The council, where the cry of competing interests and differing theologies
and commemorative customs is heard, is gradually overcoming its early
clumsiness. With its approval a new guidebook is being written, further
righting the record. The permanent exhibition at base camp is being
modernised with a broader historical context and there are plans to put
explanatory signs and photographs at Birkenau, hitherto left largely
uninterpreted. Some minor, non-controversial, conservation work is being
undertaken.
Curators from the Metropolitan Museum in New York have estimated that
Auschwitz will cost Dollars 42m (Pounds 28m) to preserve; but until an
overall policy has been decided the figure means little. A Dollars 500,000
donation from the Greek government has been received, but a larger Belgian
government contribution has been held up by wrangling as to who should be
the channel for it, and a DM10m (Pounds 3.8m) pledge from German government
and private donors through the Lauder Foundation in the US is conditional on
specific schemes being drawn up.
One obvious gap is the lack of a Jewish memorial, said Webber, but the main
task is to develop an overall concept of the place, to steer a path between
the 'theme park' approach (though that, he said, need not be so terrible)
and a dignified memorial. Ideally, all the exhibition material should be
removed and put into an educational centre outside the camp. This is what
David Cesarani calls the 'poetic approach'. The place should be left silent
and eerie, he said, and the explanation of that silence provided elsewhere.
'Auschwitz is didactic above all but I think the site speaks for itself if
people know a little before they arrive. It can be freeze-dried, and should
be, not left to sink into the marsh.'
Webber agreed that 'clumsy exhibitions in old barrack blocks are not the
way.' But he disagrees about the far future. 'The question is how to let
Auschwitz sink into the European consciousness. There should be a serious
monument so that in 200 or 300 years there is something left to see.
Otherwise I think the whole thing should be allowed to rot.'
A perfect solution was impossible in this transitional age, he added. 'The
fuss and problems are very healthy, a reflection of decent, ordinary, moral
concern. That's perfectly reasonable. But in the long term it will sort
itself out.'
Ben Helfgott, a 64-year-old retired businessman living in London, spent more
than five years in concentration camps. He was 10 years old when he and his
family were herded into a ghetto in their home town of Piotrkow, near Lodz.
He was just 13 when his mother was killed, just 15 when his father was taken
away. One sister was killed. Another, like him, survived with a tiny handful
of the 1 1/2 m children rounded up.
'Decent people - you and me - say some of the arguments are trivial. But we
don't live in a rational world. I believe that somehow, while one has to be
careful of what revisionists will say, we have to make sure that we preserve
what is left. It might look slightly different, but still it is there.
'Nothing is an answer to what we suffered,' he said. 'No-one in the world,
not even a writer like Levi whose description is almost divine, can really
convey what we felt, what we experienced - the starvation, the punishments,
the beatings, the humiliation, lack of sleep, being eaten by vermin.'
There were two debts to be paid, he said finally, one to those who were
killed, the other to those still to be born. 'So that those who died will
not have died in vain we must be constantly aware of what happens when a
government or people take it on themselves to decide the fate of other
people. The safety of individuals must be preserved. That is a sacred duty
of all of us.
'That is why the places should be there for people to see. It's important to
preserve them with dignity, without exploitation or exaggeration. Auschwitz
can be preserved both as a symbol and as a museum. I don't see it as an
issue.'
We may never be able properly to understand what happened at places like
Auschwitz. But to see the remains is to comprehend, in physical
confrontation, the real meaning of Hitler's war.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Tory anger at Portillo attack on foreign corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday embroiled
the government in another embarrassing row after launching an attack on
corruption in foreign countries.
Speaking in Southampton, Mr Portillo contrasted the integrity and honesty of
public life in Britain with corruption and dishonesty overseas.
He quickly backed away from his remarks with an apology, saying he had made
a mistake in 'grossly exaggerating' the level of corruption in foreign
countries. He said his comments to students were designed to rebut the
allegation that Britain was descending into sleaze.
However, his remarks infuriated some Conservative backbenchers who
questioned the chief secretary's judgment in making a controversial speech a
day after the prime minister had called for party unity. Robert Hicks, a
pro-European, said: 'This is ridiculous. I wonder if he lives in the real
world. Where is the evidence in our community partners that such practises
exist.' A senior Tory MP said Mr Portillo's remarks were 'a severe
embarrassment to the government'.
In his comments to students, the chief secretary said: 'If any of you have
got an A level it is because you have worked at it; go to any other country
and when you have got an A level you have bought it.'
He went on to say: 'When you go into business you will win contracts because
you are good at what you do. Go to a number of other countries and you would
win contracts because your cousin was a minister or because you have lined
the pocket of some public official.'
His comments follow his recent speech lauding British institutions. Downing
Streetthen blocked a speech which would have emphasised the chief
secretary's Euro-sceptic credentials.
A spokesman at the German Embassy said: 'There is no question that our
students cheat. It is ridiculous to make such a comment.' A Japanese Embassy
spokesman said: 'We certainly do not buy our qualifications.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / Higher bank lending and car sales point to upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp acceleration in the rate of bank lending and a big increase in new
car registrations yesterday underlined the UK economy's steady recovery.
Loans to the private sector by the main high street banks shot up from
Pounds 3.13bn in the third quarter to Pounds 5.37bn in the fourth,
confirming the upturn in bank lending seen over the previous few months.
The seasonally adjusted rise wasthe biggest for three years and included an
increase in borrowing by companies for the first time since June 1992,
according to the British Bankers' Association.
Further evidence of recovery came with the publication of figures fornew car
registrations for last month. They jumped 20 per cent compared with a year
ago as demand for new cars grew.
Adding to the good news, confidential sales figures from 27 of the UK's
housebuilders showed that sales of new houses picked up strongly last month.
The statistics, collected by the House Builders Federation, indicated that
the recovery in new house sales, which began last year, had been sustained
in spite of concern about forthcoming tax increases.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the bankers' association, said renewed
bank borrowing by the company sector - after more than a year of debt
repayments - was the reason for the upturn in lending.
However, most of the company sector loans went to the financial sector, with
very little flowing into industry. Lending to manufacturers rose for the
first time in three years, but the seasonally adjusted quarterly increase of
0.5 per cent was marginal.
'The feeling is that there is still not a pick-up in lending to the real
economy, but perhaps things are turning,' said Mr John Ecklin, director of
statistics at the association.
Mortgage lending was entirely responsible for the quarter's rise in personal
borrowing, with lending for consumption still down. The association said
consumers were tending to borrow from finance houses - rather than banks -
for consumer items, particularly cars.
It added that the big quarterly increase in private sector bank lending
would have been even greater but for the securitisation of nearly Pounds
800m of mortgages and other personal lending.
After allowing for the securitisation of mortgages, the annualised growth
rate in private sector lending by the nine main banking groups rose to 8.6
per cent.

Tens of thousands of users of the Internet, a global 'information highway',
have had their passwords stolen, leaving their private computer files
andmessages vulnerable to intruders.
Internet is an international web of computer networks linking about 2m
computers in businesses, government offices, universities and homes. Use of
the Internet has grown fast, especially in companies which see it as a
low-cost international electronic mail system. Up to 1m new users per month
are tapping into the Internet, according to data traffic counters.
'Intruders have already captured access information for tens of thousands of
systems across the Internet,' says an advisory issued by the Computer
Emergency Response Team, a US-government funded panel of computer experts
that oversees Internet security.
The alert was issued on Thursdaynight. 'All systems that offer remote access
(to the Internet) are at risk,' CERT warned. 'Intruders have already
captured access information for tens of thousands of systems across the
Internet.'
Secret passwords have apparently been collected illicitly by people using
sophisticated surveillance software programs called 'sniffers' that record
the first several words typed by a legitimate Internet user to establish a
link with another computer on the Internet. This usually includes a user's
name and password.
CERT has recommended that all Internet users change their passwords. This is
only a short term solution because new passwords may also be illicitly
recorded. Expert advice is that computer systems be isolated from the
Internet to prevent invasion.
Security on the Internet is a rising problem, said Mr Bruce Baker, head of
information security program at SRI International. 'There are now many, many
peopledoing unethical things on the Internet.'
Thesecurity problems on the Internet raise questions about future
'superinformation highways' that the Clinton administration is promoting as
a boon to the US economy and society.

The struggle for control of the Independent newspapers is rapidly developing
into a Whitehall farce with an Irish tycoon to the left, southern Europe
media magnates to the right, and a wicked Australian creating merry hell off
stage. There now appear any number of possible conclusions to the
confrontation which emerged yesterday. The MGN-led consortium, with the
support of the Independent's founders, El Pais and La Repubblica, seems
intent on simply pressing ahead with its 250p a share offer. After all, it
already controls 47 per cent. But that offer seems bound to fail at that
price, given the Irish Independent newspapers has just bought 25 per cent at
350p a share. The consortium is unlikely ever to match that price.
Conversely, Mr Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent group cannot hope to make
any sense of its new investment without working with the consortium. That
makes it imperative for Newspaper Publishing's non-executive directors to
hammer out a speedy resolution. The two investing groups must be reconciled
and the split board re-united if the fall in the newspapers' circulation is
to be arrested.
Whatever the outcome, the episode has highlighted the poverty of expansion
opportunities open to MGN. It has been keen to diversify away from its
mature newspaper business. But with an unproven management team, Pounds 300m
of debt, negative net worth if intangibles are excluded, and a share price
rating at a substantial discount to other media groups, MGN has distinctly
limited options. The Independent deal offers some scope for additional print
capacity and cost savings. But it would be better to walk away than to sink
further into a political quagmire when the financial upside appears so
limited.

<TEXT>
Rumblings from Honda were only to be expected in the wake of British
Aerospace's decision to sell Rover to BMW. Revenge is, after all, often the
first thought of jilted brides. Whether Honda will carry through its veiled
threats is the nice calculation which BMW has to weigh. While the deal was
consummated quickly, the courtship between Rover and BMW went on for four
months, so BMW has had time to consider the nature of the relationship. It
has also made efforts to woo the Japanese carmaker in the last week. While
Honda can still profit from the relationship, it will always be difficult to
judge the response of a company which has been so badly slighted.
Elsewhere, the tidying up of BAe continues apace. Making provision for the
leases on its turboprop aircraft will help prepare the business for merger
with a joint-venture partner. The company says there is no need for a rights
issue, which is no surprise since the Rover deal has released Pounds 2bn of
cash and banking facilities. While the sale and provisions will shrink BAe's
balance sheet, it has plenty of capacity to finance its defence business and
any joint ventures it wishes to establish.
Talk about the departure of Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, later this year
comes at the end of a heavy phase of restructuring. If a suitably
heavyweight non-executive is found to replace him, shareholders should have
little to worry about. More curious is the closer ties to GEC being mooted
by Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive. While he is clearly right that
consolidation of the European defence industry is inevitable, there still
remains the choice of national champions like a merged GEC and BAe or
European-wide joint ventures along the lines of Tornado or Eurofighter. That
battle has yet to be fought.

FT  05 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: The Fed rides in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Federal Reserve decides to tighten monetary conditions for the
first time since 1989, the immediate thought is that the long bull phase in
financial markets must have come to an end. Certainly US equities took
fright at the news, and the bond market was weaker. Look behind the unusual
fanfare with which yesterday's announcement was delivered, though, and Mr
Alan Greenspan appears like a man who, to parody President Theodore
Roosevelt, speaks loudly and carries a small stick. All that has actually
happened is that the Federal Reserve has signalled a move in the federal
funds rate from 3 to 3.25 per cent. That should not turn the world upside
down.
Mr Greenspan's task was delicate. The federal funds rate was originally set
at 3 per cent to protect the US economy and financial system from a
deflationary credit crunch. The banking system is healthy again, while the
economy has recovered to the point where capacity shortages start to loom on
the albeit still distant horizon. But inflationary pressures are not yet
visible and the recovery remains patchy. Yesterday's tightening appeared
aimed at pre-empting future inflation without stopping growth.
Mr Greenspan's willingness to act so early, and when he still faces
important congressional testimony within the next few weeks, is a powerful
demonstration of intent to keep the lid on inflation. That may just be
sufficient to convince the bond market. If so, the risk of further
tightening is small and other markets can return, more or less, to business
as normal. A wholesale repatriation of the US investment funds from Europe
and emerging markets in Asia would be unlikely.
But it is a close call. A half point on the federal funds rate would have
been a greater initial shock but would also have had more of the flavour of
a one-off move. Expectation of more tightening to come could keep financial
markets under pressure. When they are falling, cash is worth holding even if
money market rates are still low. If the dollar continues to rise sharply on
anticipation of higher US rates, the attraction of overseas markets to US
investors may also diminish. Its rise over DM1.76 last night, which
incidentally will make German rate cuts harder to deliver, is not
immediately auspicious.
Here again, though, much depends on whether a quarter point is deemed
convincing when the immediate dust has settled. Even if it is, there is
little prospect of another sharp fall in US bond yields. The upside for
equity markets, in the UK as well as in the US, must also be limited. UK
equities in particular have spent a long time piggy-backing bonds. Now they
will have to depend more on corporate earnings for momentum.

FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fed credit curbs send Dow
tumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks yesterday suffered their worst setback in over two years after the
Federal Reserve announced that its policy-making body had decided to tighten
credit conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 96.24 at 3,871.42. It was its
biggest fall in the single day since November 15, 1991. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 plunged 11.41 to 469.81. In the secondary
markets, the American SE composite was 8.89 lower at 478.29, and the Nasdaq
composite 20.51 off at 777.28.
Volume on the NYSE was very heavy, with 377m shares traded by the close.
Declining issues outnumbered advances by 2,032 to 296.
After a soft opening, the market went into a tail spin after Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that the Federal Open MarketCommittee had
voted to increase pressure on reserve positions, a move associated with a
slight rise in short-term rates.
Share prices, which have prosperedunder the Fed's long-held policy of
accommodation, plunged on the news, with the Dow index falling about 40
points within minutes of the statement.
Stockspulled off of their session lows soon after, helped in part by
indications thatthe Fed would nudge up its target for the key Fed Funds rate
by only 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent. While an early move had been
expected, the financial markets were nevertheless surprised by the
unprecedented announcement of the Fed's intentions. the
At first, the bond market displayed a cooler reaction than equities in the
face of the long-anticipated Fed move, intended to staunch incipient
inflationary pressures in the economy. But losses started to mount in the
afternoon, especially in the intermediate segment of the maturity range,
with thefive-year note down  19/32 at 98 21/32 and the yield rising to 5.303
per cent late in the day. When bonds started to sag, the sell-off in stocks
accelerated, with the Dow finally hitting bottom at the close.
Financial issues and utilities,which are the most sensitive to fluctuations
in interest rates, were among the worst performers. Citicorp was marked down
Dollars 2 to Dollars 40 1/2 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33
3/4 and Wells Fargo Dollars 6 5/8 to Dollars 128 7/8 . Brokerage houses were
also hit hard, with Morgan Stanley dropping Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 74 5/8
and Merrill Lynch shedding Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/2 .
Amid the fresh indication that the economy may not have fared as well as
expected last month, cyclical issues, including automobile, metals and heavy
equipment companies, were also down. General Motors dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 61 5/8 , Alcoa Dollars 2 1/8 and 3M Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 104 1/2
 . On the Nasdaq, technology stocks led the retreat. Microsoft lost Dollars
3 1/4 to Dollars 82 1/4 , Sun Microsystems Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 25 1/2
and Wellfleet Communications Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 .
Canada
The Toronto TSE-300 composite index recordedits largest single-day drop
since October 1989, in continued heavy trading. It fell 113.09 points, or
2.48 per cent, to 4,447.19, with declines trouncing advances 694 to 194.

FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses meander ahead of Fed
funds move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses mostly meandered to a relatively quiet close yesterday and will
respond on Monday to the late afternoon rise in the Fed funds rate, writes
Our Markets Staff.
In the meantime, Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson,
said last night that many market professionals had not expected the Fed to
tighten until the middle of this year, or later.
Mr Edwards reckons that the tightening process could lift the Fed Funds rate
to 5 per cent by the year-end; that this will arrest the US liquidity flow
into equity-oriented mutual funds; and that emerging markets and European
bourses, the beneficiaries of last year's transatlantic flow of funds, will
face selling pressure as the 'weight of money' argument dries up.
PARIS had already closed when the news from the US Federal Reserve was
announced but, earlier, it had shown a slight improvement on good US jobs
data.
The CAC-40 index added 7.18 to 2,329.17, a rise of 0.7 per cent over the
week.
On the downside, Paribas slipped FFr21 to FFr560 as investors took profits
following the group's results which came out of hours on Thursday. The
results were much in line with expectations and, as James Capel noted, much
of the good news was already built into the share price, the group having
outperformed the market since the beginning of the year.
Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical company, advanced FFr6.50 to FFr235.50, as it
made positive comments about the prospects for a new product in the US.
FRANKFURT continued to nurse its domestic concerns, the Dax index falling to
2,121.84 at one point before it closed the session 13.47 lower at 2,138.25;
it recovered slightly to an Ibis-indicated 2,143.90 in the post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM11.8bnbn to DM9.1bn. Disappointment remained that the
Bundesbank did not cut its key rates on Thursday but falls in the Bavarian
banks, Bayernverein and Bayernhpyo, of DM10 to DM533 and DM12 to DM467 were
ascribed to technical reasons rather than their interest-rate sensitivity;
Mr Adrian Hopkinson, at Smith New Court, said Bayernverein was in the middle
of a rights issue and Bayernhpyo at the end of a warrants exercise.
AMSTERDAM took a fresh look at KLM and decided that the time was right to
buy, following the airline's announcement on Thursday that it was seeking to
reduce its debt burden by a global offering of 20m ordinary shares. The
issue closed at a four-year high, rising Fl 3.80 to Fl 52.00, with some
brokers commenting that the rise was partly a result of short covering.
Analysts felt that the airline was well positioned to benefit from any
upturn in the industry. The AEX index gained 1.77 to 437.10, up 1.8 per cent
on the week.
The day's performances were not all one way: Royal Dutch slipped Fl 1.60 to
Fl 209.30 and Wolters Kluwer dipped a further Fl 1.80 to Fl 124.40.
MILAN's banking sector was again in the spotlight, while profit-taking in
the broader market left the Comit index 1.15 lower at 671.70, but still 4.7
per cent up on the week.
Credito Italiano rose L91 or 4.7 per cent to L2,565 and BCI was L125 or 2.6
per cent ahead at L5,240, benefiting from a change in legislation which is
likely to lead to a boost in their credit business. The sector also
continued to draw support from the success of this week's privatisation of
IMI, which begins trading in Milan on Wednesday; IMI was being quoted on the
grey market at L12,600-L12,900, compared with the L10,900 offer price.
Alitalia A shares surged L213 or 19.8 per cent to L1,286 in response to
recent management changes and comments by Mr Roberto Schisano, managing
director designate, that the airline would have to be restructured to make
it attractive ahead of its planned privatisation.
Montedison finished a week of huge volume with a L14 rise to L1,204, with
66.7m shares traded, the stock now seen as a recovery candidate.
ZURICH continued higher, the SMI index adding 14.7 to 3,166.6, for a 0.8 per
cent rise over the week.
Banks remained firm ahead of results which begin later in the month. CS
Holding added SFr9 to SFr760 and UBS bearers rose SFr8 to SFr1,513. A SFr15
rise to SFr279 by Adia was attributed to strong demand from London.
Nestle, strong for much of the week, dipped SFr1 to SFr1,389 amid reports
that investors were swapping into Unilever which was seen as relatively
cheap. Ciba registered shares added SFr10 to SFr924 as Goldman Sachs
upgraded the stock. Ascom shed SFr60 to SFr1,300 after saying that it
expected losses of SFr150-SFr350 for 1993.
STOCKHOLM saw a busy day's trading which left the Affarsvarlden index 2.8
higher at 1,594.0, up 1.3 per cent on the week. Timber stocks put in a
strong performance after news of rises in pulp and paper prices. HELSINKI
was supported by the positive outlook for the economy. The Hex index added
9.87 to 1,971.96, up 5.9 per cent on the week.
ISTANBUL fell another 3.2 per cent, the 592.9 drop in the composite index
leaving it with a three-day drop of 14.7 per cent at 17,894.8, but only 6.8
per cent lower on another volatile week. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders
commented that some favourable signs were appearing with overnight rates
beginning to tick down, and expectations that the market would find support
at the 17,500-18,000 level.

FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead in
spite of uncertainty
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equities closed marginally higher in thin trading in spite of the coalition
government's withdrawal of its tax and fiscal stimulus plan, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
Sentiment was encouraged, however, following assurances by Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, that a new package would be formulated and
announced next week.
The Nikkei index closed up 126.61 at the day's peak of 20,301.43 after a low
of 20,034.80 in the early afternoon. The index has risen 8 per cent over the
week. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 2.07 to 1,614.80
and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.32 to 1,336.39.
Volume was 370m shares after Thursday's 540m as many investors remained
absent because of the prolonged political haggling. Traders expect caution
next week ahead of Mr Hosokawa's talks with Mr Bill Clinton, the US
president, on Friday. However, they fear that a sell-off could be triggered
if the government scaled down its income tax cut from Y6,000bn as originally
announced. Advances led declines by 609 to 422.
Speculative issues were higher on short-term trading by individuals. Hanwa,
the steel trader, rose Y23 to Y705 and Mitsumi Electric gained Y30 to
Y1,900.
Honda Motor, which had declined recently following BMWs acquisition of
Rover, recovered Y40 to Y1,570. Nissan Motor fell Y15 to Y840 on
profit-taking.
Many banks continued to fall on selling by corporate investors. Industrial
Bank of Japan lost Y70 to Y3,130 and Sumitomo Bank Y30 to Y2,160.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 70.55 to 21,782.36 in volume of 133.1m
shares.
Roundup
A round of profit-taking was seen in some Pacific Rim markets, trimming
advances seen over previous sessions.
HONG KONG rose sharply on institutional demand for blue chips. The Hang Seng
index added 306.44, or 2.6 per cent, to 12,157.57, for a week's rise of 6.8
per cent.
HSBC Holdings led the day's gains, up HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 131, while
Hang Seng Bank leapt HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 80.00.
Among gains elsewhere Jardine Matheson surged HKDollars 3.00 to HKDollars
81.50 and Swire Pacific HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 66.50.
Turnover was HKDollars 10.5bn.
MANILA advanced for the third consecutive session, reflecting renewed
investor confidence after bombings and street protests over recent fuel
price rises.
The composite index rose 46.39 or 1.6 per cent to 2,965.38, a weekly rise of
1.2 per cent. Volume surged to 23.1bn shares from Thursday's 2.4bn.
SEOUL saw renewed interest in banking shares which balanced a sell-off among
blue chips. The composite index added 9.40 to 964.42, a week's rise of 4 per
cent, while the banking sub-index rose 23.60 to 582.08.
TAIWAN fell 1.7 per cent on profit-taking after four days of rises with the
selling triggered by Thursday's news that the cabinet had approved the
reimposition of a stock capital gains tax.
The weighted index ended 105.75 lower at 6,256.33, off an intra-day low of
6,181, for a 4 per cent rise over the week. Turnover remained heavy at
TDollars 100.97bn against Thursday's TDollars 122.86bn.
AUSTRALIA ended down but off its lows on after a day of profit-taking and
falls in futures and overseas markets.
The All Ordinaries index closed 7.8 lower at 2,332.8, but was still 3.2 per
cent higher on the week.
NEW ZEALAND pulled back as profits were taken after the rises of the
previous 10 sessions. But renewed demand at the lower prices enabled the
NZSE-40 capital index to pick up from the day's low of 2400.12, to finish
26.4 easier at 2,413.24, for a 3.2 per cent rise on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR was pushed lower by a 20 cent decline in Telekom Malaysia which
closed at MDollars 20.50, leaving the composite index off 2.89 at 1,147.32.
The market has gained 5 per cent this week.
BOMBAY declined towards close on profit-taking in cash shares and squaring
up of deals in the specified section ahead of the fixing of carry forward
charges today. The BSE 30-share index closed 83.39 lower at 3,917.57.

FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg jumpy as it scales new
peaks - This week's changed sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday's reports that the African National Congress and the National
Party were close to an accord with the Freedom Alliance, enabling the
right-wing coalition to take part in April's elections, turned investment
sentiment around in South Africa this week.
The overall index jumped 127 to 4,899, with the industrial index up 120, or
more than 2 per cent to 5,679 and, by last night, the respective closes were
5,021 and a new high of 5,822 respectively.
In the three weeks prior to this the deluge of foreign investment in South
African equities, which had seen records tumble on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange since October, had dwindled to a trickle. Foreigners were net
buyers of shares worth R1.2bn (Dollars 350m) between Christmas and
mid-January, but bouts of selling saw net purchases shrink to R43m in the
last week of the month. The JSE's overall index scaled the 5,000 level for
the first time in the New Year before falling more than 5 per cent to 4,784
by the beginning of February.
This week, say JSE floor dealers, local institutions have returned to the
market and overseas investors have started 'to nibble' at blue chips again.
The roller-coaster performance of equities since sanctions were lifted at
the end of September - clearing the way for US fund-managers to build up
portfolios at will on the JSE for the first time in nearly 10 years - has
confirmed that the stock market, though firmly in a bull run, remains no
less susceptible to fears about the transition to the new South Africa.
Any thoughts that the surge in foreign ownership of South Africa equities
amounted to a free lunch have been dashed by the JSE's heightened
vulnerability to overseas investment sentiment.
The deadlock in pre-election negotiations coincided with the release of the
final draft of the ANC's reconstruction and development programme.
Over-hasty interpretations of the ANC's poorly worded draft mining policy
raised fears - now abated - that a potential government was bent on wresting
control of mineral rights from the private sector, and interfering in
minerals marketing. James Capel put out a sell recommendation on South
African stocks including the country's leading mining industrial group,
Anglo American, which sank to R192 after foreigner buyers had pushed it from
R90 to R239 in the a year.
The condition of the gold market continues to play a critical role in JSE
affairs. By mid-January bullion was up at Dollars 393, set to test Dollars
400 for the first time since July, when, with the help of a Gold Fields
Mineral Services report showing a sharp decline in physical demand for the
metal in 1993, it lost momentum to slump to Dollars 377 at the end of the
month. The metal's weakness knocked JSE gold shares at the same time as the
mining industry and investors reacted violently to the ANC's first
statements on mining policy. Gold prices are back above Dollars 385, a sign
if any was needed that medium-term outlook for shares remains bullish. The
stream of fund managers and investment banks visiting South Africa has
continued.
Mr Richard Stuart, of stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co, says that US funds are still
in the early stages of accumulating local stock. By pushing share prices up,
they have been able to winkle out tightly-held quality scrip from local
institutions.
On the economic front, there is little bad news to dissuade them. The
economy pulled out of recession in the third quarter of 1993, with
annualised quarter-on-quarter growth of 8 per cent; summer rains promise a
bumper maize crop; and inflation fell to 9.7 per cent in 1993, its lowest
level in 20 years. Growth in December's money supply convinced economists
that recovery was entrenched.
Mr Stuart said that the real support for an upbeat outlook is the
coincidence of the lifting of sanctions with the explosion of US interest in
emerging stock markets. Not only are JSE yields through the financial rand,
the foreign investment currency unit, particularly attractive compared with
markets in Latin American and south-east Asia, but the JSE - currently
capitalised at about R700bn (Dollars 205bn) - is about to be incorporated in
the International Finance Corporation and Morgan Stanley emerging market
indices, which will give added importance to South African equities in
international portfolios.
Foreign investors are looking at the JSE through a different lens, no longer
restricted to its distinctive gold, platinum and diamond mining counters,
but focused on industrial stocks which can offer appealing, if not as
lucrative returns as their counterparts in Argentina, Malaysia and Taiwan.
'Reconstruction, consumption and resources are what investors are looking
for', says Mr Stuart, explaining US investors' thirst for shares in Anglo,
the steel-maker Iscor, the construction group Murry &amp; Roberts, and South
African Breweries.
However, Mr Doug Ellish, head of research at brokers Anderson Wilson, points
out the cloud on the horizon: 'South Africa faces a window of opportunity of
four years of steady GDP growth, but then an ANC government will have to
balance meeting populist demands without losing the sound macro-economic
principles it promises it will follow. Any recklessness, and the foreign
funds will go.'

<TEXT>
Hong Kong bank HSBC leapt forward as investors responded to increased
strength in the far eastern market. There was also big switching between the
Hong Kong traded stock and the ordinaries as dealers noted the 20p spread
between the two classes of share. One block of a million shares moved
between the two and the Hong Kongs gained 41 to 1117p on turnover of 4.8m
while the ordinaries jumped 43 to 1099p with 9.8m traded.
The shares were further helped by arecommendation from Nomura, the Japanese
stockbroker. Nomura was also a buyer of Standard Chartered, up 16 at 1431p.
The announcement that Granada's bid for LWT would not be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission sent Granada shares jumping 7 to 586p and
LWT up 6 to 702p. It also excited interest among other broadcasters, with
Anglia adding 3 to 650p, Scottish 5 to 540p and Ulster 5 to 678p.
Rank Organisation fell 8 to 1061p with Nomura said to be telling clients
that the share price was overvalued by 200p.
A trading statement from Vaux, the regional brewer and hotel group, was
duller than the market expected and the shares declined 7 to 296p. The
company said the domestic drinks market remained very competitive.
Prudential Corporation, the UK's leading insurance group, fell 6 to 356p
following Thursday's deal carried out by Smith New Court. The securities
house said it placed all the 46m shares it boughtfrom one investment
institution by the close of trading on Thursday.
SunAlliance fell 5 to 404p with Strauss Turnbull citing it as a trading
sell.
Lloyds shares fell 14 to 625p ahead of figures from the high street bank on
Friday. Lloyds Abbey Life, the bank's insurance subsidiary which publishes
its figures on Wednesday eased 3 to 446p.
The regional electricity companies were in demand. Manweb, which was said to
be hosting a series of institutional meeting yesterday, gained 16 to 844p,
East Midlands added 11 to 715p and South West put on 9 to 740p.
Chemicals stocks were buoyant with Allied Colloids leaping 12 to 279p as
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, recommended the shares.
Pharmaceuticals group Medeva slipped 7 1/2 to 175p as UBS issued a sell
recommendation.
Food retailers underwent another poor session with the selling pressure of
recent days showing little sign of abating. J Sainsbury, which triggered the
latest bout of selling with its poor trading statement of two weeks ago,
once again bore the brunt of the slide, the shares retreating 9 to 361p in
hefty turnover of 8.7m. Kwik Save fell 28 to 577p and Argyll 5 to 258p.
Tesco again enjoyed a modicum of support, gaining a halfpenny to 222 1/2 p.
Among food manufacturers, debate over the likelihood of a rights issue at
Cadbury Schweppes continued but dealers said Hoare Govett, the company's
broker, was dismissive of the notion. Talk of a Pounds 1bn cash call has
intensified ahead of Cadbury's results next month, with Dr Pepper/Seven Up
the rumoured target. Cadbury shares rallied on theHoare caution but closed 3
adrift at 514p.
Among vehicle distributors, Bletchley rose 10 to 375 on news that it planned
to raise Pounds 5m via a placing and share offer. Rolls-Royce were off 3 at
177p, still suffering from the loss of a Japan Airlines order to Pratt and
Whitney and talk of a BZW sell recommendation.
Babcock Engineering dropped 2 1/2 to 37p on rumours that the company might
announce a rights issue.

<TEXT>
The insurance and tobacco conglomerate, BAT Industries, held its own in a
badly shaken sector as SG Warburg recommended the stock.
International stocks fell sharply in late trading onnews that the US Federal
reserve was tightening monetary policy. However BAT, which carries out a
large proportion of its business in the US, was unchanged at 510 1/2 p with
Mr Mark Duffy of Warburg arguing that the yield on the stock was at a 40 per
cent premium to the market yield and concerns over group's tobacco interests
were already in the share price. He also felt rumours of BAT buying
Frenchinsurer Group Victoire were completely overdone.
Pearson fell 13 to 712p, Reuters Holdings shed 30 at 1935p and RMC, tumbled
19 to 967p.

FT  05 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe rises on bid war speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence and engineering giant British Aerospace tookcentre stage for a
second time this week on rumours of a counter bid for its Rover subsidiary
and on the news of a larger than expected Pounds 250m provision for its
regional turboprop fleet.
Dealers reacted with initial shock to the level of provisions and marked the
shares sharply lower. However, the stock ralliedquickly on rumours that
BAe's Pounds 800m deal with BMW could be surpassed. Renault was seen as a
potential bidder while a Rover management buyout was also mentioned. But it
was Honda - holder of a 20 per cent stake in Rover - which received most
attention. The shares eventually closed up 22 at 575p, with turnover hitting
6.7m.
Analysts were sceptical of any bid. 'Honda was offered the BAe stake last
autumn and decided not to take it,' said Mr Bruce McDonald at Smith New
Court.
Suggestions that GEC, up 5 at 349 1/2 p, might revive interest inBAe were
not taken too seriously.
BAe's decision to make provisions was universally admired as simplifying the
balance sheet. Although widely foreshadowed, the amount was Pounds 50m more
than expected and triggered an early sell-off to 538p. But initial worries
melted away on closer scrutiny and one analyst, reflecting the confident
mood over BAe since the Rover deal, forecast a target upsideof 700p a share.

Footsie futures traded at a discount to the underlying market and was
largely responsible for dragging it down yesterday. But the new contract on
the Mid 250 Index put in a strong performance on its first trading day.
March opened at 3,497 and hit 3,475 by the official close, a seven-point
discount to the cash market. In after hours trading, it hit 3,456, almost 20
index points below cash.
The new Mid 250 contract on the OMLX futures market traded at a healthy
premium to the underlying index to close at 4,146.40 on turnover of 1,900
lots. Officials said there was good institutional demand and the spread on
the contract was narrowed to around three index points.

FT  05 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market upset by rise in US
interest rates - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A generally uncomfortable session in the London stock market turned into a
general retreat just before the close of business as the US Federal Reserve
confirmed the market's fears by signalling a tightening of its monetary
policy.
The Fed's move, increasing its Fed Funds rate by  1/4 of one per cent,
although by no means unexpected, proved the final straw for a UK equity
struggling to maintain its balance. Down 8.1 points as the futures market
closed at 4.10pm, the FT-SE 100 continued to lose ground and was trading
around 10 points off as the Fed news hit the markets.
At the official close the FT-SE 100 was 16.1 lower at 3,475.4. Such was the
volume of business being put through the market after the news, with most of
it on the sell side, that dealers said the 100 index would almost certainly
have been another 10 points off shortly after 4.30pm. Late trading in the
future, dealers said, would have produced a fall of around 39 points on the
FT-SE 100.
The instant reaction of market strategists to the US move tended to favour
the shift in policy. At Charterhouse Tilney, Mr Richard Jeffrey said the
rise in US rates was 'not unexpected, it happened because the US economy is
moving in the right direction. It's a sign of confidence.' He saw the UK
equity market 'pausing for breath,' and said it would give hard pressed
marketmakers a chance to get some much needed stock on their books; 'but I
wouldn't chase the market much higher from here,' he continued.
Mr Robert Buckland at NatWest Securities said the interest rate rise was
'earlier than we had expected,' but that it would 'enhance the credibility
of the Fed and keep the long end of the US bond market happy but containing
inflationary pressures; we're happy with our stance on the UK equity
market.'
Another positive view was adopted by Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull who
spoke of 'a pre-emptive strike' and said the Fed stance would be good for
bonds and therefore good for equity markets.'
The opposite view was forthcoming from Kleinwort Benson's Mr Edmund Warner,
who bleakly described the rate rise as 'posing the greatest threat to global
markets since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait; it is just the first of a
series of rate rises in the US this year and will choke off the flow of
funds. We remain very nervous of the UK equity market.'
The equity market began the session on relatively good form, the FT-SE 100
opening modestly higher in relatively quiet trading. The storm clouds began
to gather in mid-session, however, and prices fell away for the rest of the
day.
Second-line stocks came under big selling pressure late in the day. 'There
is big selling and we could be in for an awkward week,' said one
marketmaker. The Mid 250 index, which has consistently outpaced the 100
index since the year end, ended the day 6.4 off at 4,146.4, but remained
80.8 higher on the week. The FT-SE 100 showed a 28 rise over the same
period.
Turnover in equities tailed off yesterday, totalling 785.1m shares as the
market fell back. The value of customer business on Thursday reached a hefty
Pounds 2.43bn.
There were, however, some outstanding stock performers. The two far eastern
influenced banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered maintained their exceptional
performances, while British Aerospace raced ahead on rumours of a
counter-bid for Rover.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Fed boosts Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The varied fortunes of the US dollar caused hectic activity in foreign
exchange markets yesterday as the US Federal Reserve announced the first
tightening of monetary policy in nearly five years, writes Philip Gawith.
After the Fed's late afternoon announcement of a 25 basis points increase in
the Federal Funds rate, the dollar rose in heavy trading by over 3 pfennigs
as the market took heart from the prospect of higher rates and confirmation
of US economic recovery.
Although profit-taking pushed the dollar lower as the London market closed,
it later rose again in New York and was trading yesterday evening above the
DM1.76 level, the strongest level since August 1991 and nearly three
pfennigs above Thursday's close of DM1.7314. Yesterday evening sterling was
trading at Dollars 1.4750, almost 2 1/2 cents down on Thursday's close.
The US rate move put the D-Mark under pressure and it showed losses on most
crosses within the ERM.
Earlier in the afternoon the dollar fell below DM1.7350 when the release of
lower than expected US employment figures dashed hopes of higher interest
rates.
Although yesterday's announcement by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed,
surprised the market, he had hinted at his intentions on Monday when he told
a congressional committee that rates would have to be raised at some point.
He said the central bank would 'increase slightly the degree of pressure on
reserve positions' in order to put upward pressure on rates.
The Fed's decision was welcomed in the market as a vindication of the
sustainability of economic recovery in the US. Mr Greenspan himself stressed
this view saying 'The decision was taken to move towards a less
accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to sustain and enhance the
economic expansion.'
This view was endorsed by Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research
at UBS in London, who said the Fed's move was prompted not by concerns about
existing levels of inflation, but 'as an insurance policy to ensure that in
the longer term inflation remains under control.'
Mr Chertkow said the Fed had moved too slowly and too late when cutting
rates as the economy went into recession and Mr Greenspan was anxious to
avoid repeating these errors in the opposite direction.
Another view of the announcement is that it underlines the determination of
Mr Greenspan to show the Fed's independence from the US administration.
Observers said the timing of the announcement might indicate an anxiety on
the part of the Fed to tighten policy before President Clinton had time to
fill the two vacancies which currently exist on the Fed board. Mr Clinton
said last week that he saw no need for interest rates to be raised.
Analysts predict that the tightening will be the first in a string of
monetary policy decisions, which could see the Federal Funds rate rising by
a further 75 basis points this year.
The US move spilled over into Canada when Mr Paul Martin, the finance
minister, responded by saying Canada could have lower interest rates than
the US. This caused the Canadian dollar to tumble within minutes to CDollars
1.3440 from CDollars 1.3360. Traders said the Bank of Canada was supporting
the currency.
The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money market with Pounds
1.85bn of assistance after revising its forecast of the liquidity shortage
to Pounds 1.85bn.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Aluminium price rise
boils over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the froth was blown off the recent aluminium price rally yesterday
after a Russian industry official cast doubt on his country's ability to
deliver promised production cuts in full this year.
At multilateral talks in Brussels last month - called to tackle the world
supply glut caused by a flood of Russian aluminium into the west - the
Russians agreed to institute over the next six months output cuts amounting
to 500,000 tonnes in a full year. But yesterday Mr Andrei Yefimov, head of
DEAL, the Russian association of aluminium and titanium plants, estimated
that his government would be able to cut production by no more than 300,000
tonnes in 1994.
He said there was strong resistance to cuts from the 850,000-tonnes-a-year
Bratsk smelter in eastern Siberia, while smaller smelters in Sayansk and
Irkutsk had also refused to sign the deal, Reuter reported from Moscow.
However, Mr Lev Lubensky, commercial director of the small Nadvoitsy
aluminium smelter in northern Russia, took issue with Mr Yefimov, saying his
statement was premature and caused unnecessary panic in trading circles.
'Yefimov's statements go too far,' he declared. 'It is a very rash thing to
say.'
Nevertheless, Mr Yefimov's remarks fuelled profit-taking at the London Metal
Exchange, where aluminium prices had been pushed to 17-month highs following
the announcement of cuts by Southwire and Alumax of the US (40,000 and
17,000 tonnes), Comalco of Australia (36,000 tonnes) and Norsk Hydro of
Norway (70,000 tonnes). Three months metal closed yesterday at Dollars
1,295.50 a tonne, Dollars 22.50 below the peak reached earlier in the day,
but still Dollars 18.50 up on the week.
US investment funds had been important contributors to aluminium's earlier
strength and were similarly influential in driving copper prices to
five-month highs - at any rate London analysts could offer no other
explanation.
Mr Ted Arnold of the Merrill Lynch financial services group pointed out that
the US funds, which had some Dollars 25bn under their management, operated
on an almost purely technical basis. When the copper market's fundamental
weakness (based on an adverse supply/demand balance) reasserted itself the
three months price was likely to dip by about Dollars 125 a tonne from the
present level.
Three months copper touched Dollars 1,936 a tonne on Thursday before
subsiding by yesterday's close to Dollars 1,888.50 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on
the week.
The fundamental problems of the zinc market were underlined this week when
LME warehouse stocks of the metal topped 1m tonnes for the first time. But
traders seemed to see that as strengthening the probability of substantial
capacity cuts being announced soon by European Union producers under a
co-operative plan worked out at recent meetings. This view was reinforced
yesterday when one of the producers told Reuter that the European Commission
was likely to be notified of plans for a 10 per cent cut (about 250,000
tonnes) within a few days. Accordingly, the three months zinc price ended
the week Dollars 17 higher at Dollars 1,033.50 a tonne.
Precious metals prices were towed higher this week by an indomitably buoyant
silver market, which put on another 39 cents to a four-year high of Dollars
5.42 1/2 a troy ounce. Once again the power of the US funds was behind rise,
although traders thought even they might have difficulty pushing through
resistance between Dollars 5.50 and Dollars 5.60.

Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest private company, lifted net profits by
4.5 per cent in real terms last year, to 9bn pesos (Dollars 2.9bn), writes
David Luhnow in Mexico City.
But the results of the telephone monopoly failed to meet analysts'
expectations, largely because of a fourth-wuarter 250m-peso write-off on
obsolete equipment.
Analysts estimated the company's earnings were about Dollars 1.40 per
American depositary receipt for the fourth quarter, and Dollars 5.47 a share
for the year, against Dollars 4.84 for 1992.
Net sales were 24.6bn pesos during 1993, up 10 per cent from 22.4bn pesos in
1992. Operating income amounted to 10.28bn pesos for the year, also up 10
per cent.

FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Volvo dismisses suggestions of a
Saab alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish motor manufacturer, has brushed off suggestions from its
domestic rival Saab Automobile that the two companies should discuss
co-operation following the collapse of Volvo's plans to merge with France's
Renault.
'It is not on the agenda at all,' Volvo said yesterday.
Saab's British chief executive, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, last month said
he was open for discussion on common development and production of car
components. He said he had spoken to Mr Lennart Jeansson, a top Volvo
executive, about the possibility of working together 'on a range of things'.
Mr Jeansson acknowledged this week that Volvo and Saab - which is jointly
owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania - already
co-operated through their use of a number of common Swedish subcontractors.
However, he said there was 'not much' potential for extending this. He
suggested any project offering real cost savings would mean Volvo and Saab
models would have to be made in the same plant, and this was unrealistic.
Mr Jeansson drove home his point with a mixed, but apposite, metaphor
referring to a failed attempt at co-operation in the 1970s. 'Saab left us on
the church steps. Since then so much has happened. Now the train has gone,'
he told a seminar of business students in Stockholm.
Volvo shares fell back sharply in Stockholm yesterday, after a week in which
they had surged on news that Renault had sold more than half of its 8.27 per
cent stake in its Swedish partner.
Swedish investors, seeing returns from a once-again profitable Volvo
enhanced by the unravelling of its ties to Renault, have pushed up Volvo
shares by some 70 per cent since the merger plan was torn up in December.
However, the heavily-traded Volvo B shares slipped SKr15 yesterday to close
at SKr678, well below the week's high point of more than SKr700.

clear TV deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, the media group, is to sell the Boston Herald newspaper in
the US to clear the way for the acquisition of the city's WFXT television
station.
Chairman and chief executive Mr Rupert Murdoch said yesterday the sale was
necessary under the Federal Communications Commission's cross-ownership rule
prohibiting the joint ownership of a television station and a newspaper in
the same market.
The newspaper, with a circulation of about 350,000, competes with the larger
Boston Globe. It is being sold for an undisclosed sum to a News Corp
executive - Mr Patrick Purcell, the publisher of the Boston Herald and the
New York Post - who will now leave News Corp to run the paper.
The WFXT television station is an affiliate of the Fox television network, a
News Corp subsidiary. It was previously owned by News Corp but was sold to
Boston Celtics Broadcasting in 1990 to comply with the FCC rule. Last
autumn, News Corp acquired options to re-acquire WFXT but said the Boston
Herald would have to go if the options were exercised.
Mr Rupert Murdoch said yesterday he was 'saddened to give up what has become
an excellent newspaper and a wonderful resource of executive talent'.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman of Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary, was sacked
yesterday. His responsibilities for marketing and distribution were taken
over immediately by Mr Herbert Demel, technical development director.
As expected, Mr Demel, 40, the youngest member of the quality carmaker's
board, was not given the title of chairman. Instead, he will act as board
'spokesman', with the same formal rank and powers as his three remaining
colleagues.
The sacking was approved unanimously by a meeting of the Audi supervisory
board, chaired by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, in the presence of
Mr Kortum.
A short statement, issued later, said his contract was to be cancelled with
immediate effect.
Mr Kortum's departure followed losses of at least DM200m (Dollars 115.6m)
last year and clashes with Mr Piech, who headed Audi until taking charge of
the VW group in January 1993.
Mr Piech discussed the manufacturing site for a planned new Audi model - one
of the sources of friction between the two men - at a meeting on Thursday
night with Mr Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria, Audi's home state.
Mr Stoiber's office said yesterday the regional government would do
everything in its power to have the car built in the state, where every
seventh job depended on the automotive industry.
It made no reference to Mr Piech's position on the project, which suggested
he is still considering using existing spare capacity, possibly in Belgium
or Saxony.
Yesterday's events suggested Audi will be run more as an operating division
of the group, under control from its Wolfsburg headquarters, rather than as
a stand-alone subsidiary.

FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paccar secures its 'king of the
road' crown - The US truckmaker is in good shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a cyclical business renowned for heady peaks and deep troughs, Paccar,
the US heavy-duty truckmaker, has earned a reputation as a profits
powerhouse, as robust as the Kenworth and Peterbuilt trucks which roll off
its assembly lines.
'Paccar is probably the best-run truckmaker in the world,' said Mr Gary
McManus, an analyst with Kemper Securities in Chicago. The classic lines of
its truck designs have inspired a fierce loyalty among truckers,
particularly the independent operators.
The Bellevue, Washington-based company recently announced that net income
surged 118 per cent, to Dollars 142.2m, in 1993, while sales climbed 31 per
cent. Heavy trucks now account for about 70 per cent of revenues.
Indeed, it was a banner year for the entire industry. Orders have jumped as
manufacturers and freight-hauling companies anticipated a sharp rise in
demand for trucking services.
However, in 1991, when the heavy-duty market was mired in its worst downturn
in a decade, Paccar was the only one of the six leading US heavy truck
manufacturers to have turned in a profit, analysts say.
That year, Paccar generated net income of Dollars 39.7m, on Dollars 2.38bn
in revenues. By contrast, Navistar International, the only other independent
company in the sector, suffered a Dollars 165m loss on Dollars 3.26bn in
revenues. The others - all US operating divisions of big international
automotive groups - also fared poorly.
With sales of class 8 vehicles - mostly trucks used to pull heavy goods
trailers - now at their highest level since 1979, all six manufacturers are
working at full production levels. However, with the significant exception
of Freightliner, the aggressive Daimler-Benz subsidiary, only Paccar is
generating handsome earnings.
Navistar's position remains uncertain. In its fourth quarter to the end of
October, it surprised Wall Street by returning to profitability with net
income of Dollars 22m, but reported a full-year net loss of Dollars 501m.
When orders return to a more normal single-digit growth level, it may have
difficulty staying in the black, analysts say.
In 1993, Paccar managed to hold its market share steady at between 22 and 23
per cent during a boom driven mostly by large fleets sales. However, the
independent operators, Paccar's traditional constituency, have shown more
reluctance to buy new equipment, and their number is shrinking.
Fleet operators, which typically place orders of 100 trucks or more, have
the clout to command big discounts. As a result, the industry has been
reduced to wafer-thin margins during most of the year.
Mr Steve Mook, owner of the New York Metro Peterbuilt dealership in the
Flushing section of New York city, says on average he makes only about
Dollars 1,000 a sale on trucks selling for about Dollars 75,000 each.
One of the reasons Paccar has remained profitable, analysts say, is because
it has been more successful at resisting pricing pressures.
Mr Mook says Paccar increased its wholesale prices twice in 1993, by 2 per
cent and then 4 per cent.
'We have never been out to buy market share,' says Mr Stephen Buckner, the
company's director of public affairs.
Mr McManus at Kemper Securities, however, says the weak pricing environment
and unfavourable customer mix have affected Paccar. He estimates operating
margins at 4 per cent, against 6-6.5 per cent in the late 1980s.
Mr David Garrity, who follows the company for McDonald &amp; Co, a Cleveland
securities house, says Paccar stays profitable partly because its operations
are leaner than most of the competition. Its workforce is younger, and it
has avoided the high post-retirement costs which nearly crippled Navistar
before it restructured its benefits programme last summer.
Why do Paccar's sales remain so strong despite the price rises?
Its Kenworths and Peterbuilts, produced by two separate Paccar divisions,
are renowned for quality engineering, as well as their distinctive - and
perhaps flashy - styling.
Peterbuilts, in particular, are often dripping with chrome accessories.
'When you buy a Peterbuilt, you buy the king of the road,' explains Mr Mook.
There is a strong sense of tradition at the Pacific northwest manufacturer,
which began at the turn of the century as a railway and logging equipment
supplier. Kenworth was acquired in the 1940s, followed by Peterbuilt in
1957. In the late 1980s, Paccar bought Foden Trucks of the UK.
Its chairman and chief executive, Mr Charles Pigott, has been described as a
grave figure, resembling a Bible Belt preacher. It is no surprise to learn
he is a grandson of the founder, given Paccar's tight-lipped, no-nonsense
corporate culture.
As for the current year, analysts say the smaller fleets and owner-operators
which began entering the heavy-duty market in the second half of 1993 are
expected to help sustain sales momentum through the first six months of
1994. With the new customer mix, margins have started to increase.
Paccar is better placed than its rivals to take advantage of the trend, and
its reputation as the king of the road seems to be assured for a while.

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: The flotation of a mixed bag of shops -
House of Fraser heads for stock market with Pounds 450m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors to House of Fraser stores in a few weeks' time will be offered more
than just the opportunity to buy new clothes or a sofa. They will be able to
register to buy shares in the company.
The group, which stretches from Inverness to Plymouth and includes names
like Dickins &amp; Jones, Army &amp; Navy, Rackhams and Binns, will announce on
Tuesday that it is to be floated on the Stock Exchange before Easter -
somewhat earlier than envisaged when the flotation, minus the flagship
Harrods, was proposed last July.
The pathfinder prospectus, which will be published at the end of the month,
is expected to show operating profits for the year to January of about
Pounds 40m. With the group likely to take on about Pounds 100m of debt from
its current owners, the Fayed brothers, analysts expect the price tag in
March to be about Pounds 450m - broadly in line with the stores sector
price/earnings multiple of about 20.
The flotation will end the involvement of the Fayeds, who acquired the
chain, including Harrods, for almost Pounds 600m in 1985 after a
bitterly-fought battle with Lonrho.
The group's directors admit that the House of Fraser name was damaged in the
feud which ensued between the Fayeds and Lonrho, but insist the stories of
neglect and starvation of funds to enable the Fayeds to pay off their debts
are wrong.
Mr Brian McGowan, the former chief executive of Williams Holdings who was
tempted out of retirement aged 48 to become non-executive chairman, says the
Fayeds spent Pounds 110m on the chain, and closed lossmaking stores, leaving
it financially sound and possessing great potential - although more
investment is required to bring all stores up to 1990s standards.
Analysts who have been whisked around the chain in recent weeks in Mr Ali
Fayed's helicopter have found a mixed bag of shops, operating under 17
different names in 52 cities, ranging from 30,000 to 300,000 sq ft.
The stores also range widely in standard of decor, from Frasers in Glasgow,
which recently had Pounds 8m lavished on refitting departments around a
sparkling new atrium, to the likes of Cavendish House in Cheltenham, where
the last real investment was Pounds 500,000 in 1984, and before that, in the
1960s.
The result is a somewhat top-heavy chain which makes more than 35 per cent
of its Pounds 695m turnover from six stores - Rackhams of Birmingham,
Kendals of Manchester, Frasers of Glasgow, DH Evans and Dickins &amp; Jones in
London, and Howells of Cardiff.
However, only four are now lossmaking and the directors are confident even
moderate investment can produce a significant uplift in sales and profits
from many stores. Mr Tony Hancock, operations manager, believes all the
stores should be able to achieve a 10 per cent return on sales.
To achieve that, the group has a two-prong strategy.
Firstly, it plans a Pounds 50m-plus investment programme over three years.
The model for the investment will not be Glasgow, but rather the Pounds 2.5m
spent on a mainly cosmetic refit of Howells of Cardiff, which has lifted
annual turnover from Pounds 25m two years ago to close to Pounds 30m.
The priority is a Pounds 3m refit of Dickins &amp; Jones of Regent Street -
which will take over from Harrods as the London flagship - including a new
atrium and network of escalators and other improvements.
Some 18 other projects this year include revamps of Bournemouth, Lincoln,
Birmingham, Manchester, and of Army &amp; Navy in London.
Secondly, the group is revising and slimming down its range, while
introducing new designer labels, and trying to strengthen the own-label
brands.
'We have a vision of being a fashion-led business, both fashion in the home
and fashion apparel,' says Mr Andrew Jennings, managing director.
Other services - such as beauty salons, restaurants and left luggage offices
 -will be introduced. Mr Jennings says these will emphasise the group's
value-added image and help it fend off competition from lower-price
opposition such as warehouse clubs and discount outlets.
He adds that the group has a strong ABC1 customer profile, often very loyal
indeed to their local store, but needs to attract more customers in the
25-35 age group in addition to the 35-59 core.
'We already attract the older Mrs Jones, but we also want the more
contemporary Ms Dickins,' he says. Convincing the City that such a
transformation is possible may not be easy.
Analysts point to the stores' poor sales per square foot figure compared
with rivals such as Debenhams and the John Lewis Partnership, and express
reservations about the future of the department store format.
'I think it's interesting in terms of what they can do with the stores,'
said one analyst.
'But I think it will be a steady growth story, not a recovery stock.'
Mr Jennings insists the department store sector is coming back into its own.
While high street specialists thrived in the late 1980s, they are now
saddled with high rents on leasehold properties. Some 92 per cent of House
of Fraser's property is freehold or long leasehold, substantially reducing
its costs.
Perhaps most importantly, he says, the chain has no direct competitor.
Debenhams specialises in clothing, much of it own-label, for a more
downmarket audience, while the John Lewis Partnership is particularly strong
in housewares.
'There is a big opportunity for fashion-led department stores selling
designer labels,' he says. 'No one else is doing it.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Profits rise to 9bn pesos by
Telmex disappoints analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LUHNOW
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest private company, lifted net profits by
4.5 per cent in real terms last year, to 9bn pesos (Dollars 2.9bn).
However, the results of the telephone monopoly failed to meet analysts'
expectations, largely because of a 250m-peso write-off on obsolete equipment
in the fourth quarter.
Analysts estimated the company's earnings amounted to about Dollars 1.40 per
American depositary receipt for the fourth quarter, and Dollars 5.47 a share
for the year, against Dollars 4.84 for 1992.
Telmex shares were down slightly in early trading yesterday.
A Mexico City analyst said: 'Investors will not be happy with the additional
charge.' He said the results would dampen the Mexican Bolsa's current bull
run.
The company said it installed 867,228 new phone lines during 1993, bringing
its total number of lines to 7.62m, a 12.8 per cent jump over 1992.
Telmex is replacing Mexico's outdated telephone system with an fibre-optic
system in one of the world's largest projects of its type.
The company posted net sales worth 24.6bn pesos during 1993, up 10 per cent
from 22.4bn pesos in 1992. Operating income amounted to 10.28bn pesos for
the year, also up 10 per cent.
Analysts said Telmex, owned by Mexican conglomerate Grupo Carso, will need
to invest heavily in the next few years to face the opening of long-distance
competition in August 1996. Several US-based telecommunications companies
have expressed interest in entering the Mexican market. Under the terms of
its concession, Telmex remains a monopoly until then.

The recovery continued in the second half at Heavitree Brewery, the
USM-traded pub operator, resulting in profits for the year to October 31 of
Pounds 1.32m pre-tax, against Pounds 496,000.
The Exeter-based company said the increase was the result of improved terms
from suppliers, lower interest rates on lower borrowings and a cut in bad
debts.
Turnover was static at Pounds 8.35m (Pounds 8.38m). The pre-tax figure was
helped by lower net interest charges of Pounds 346,000 (Pounds 527,000) and
an exceptional credit of Pounds 40,000, against a charge last time of Pounds
60,000.
Earnings per share came to 11.2p (3.3p) and an increased final dividend of

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Investors trust in low interest rates - Why
launches of new funds are at record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   Bu BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment trust launches in the first month of 1994 have raised more money
than the total for 1992, and could beat the 1993 total by the end of the
first quarter. More than Pounds 1bn is accounted for by two trusts alone -
the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust and theMercury
European Privatisation Trust.
New issues are coming out virtually every other day to mop up the demand
that has been pushing many existing trusts' share prices to a premium to net
asset value. There are currently about a dozen trusts at various stages of
launch, from the first announcement of intent, tothe final listing.
This level of activity is chiefly the result of the same low interest rate
environment which has fuelled the 'flight into equities' already evidenced
by record unit trust inflows. Private investors are searching for homes for
their money which offer higher returns than the 3 or 4 per cent paid by many
building society accounts.
The record demand for the two European privatisation trusts shows just how
much money is looking for a home. The offer for the Kleinwort European
Privatisation Investment Trust closed on Wednesday with applications being
drastically scaled back to keep the trust to its maximum size of Pounds
500m. Enough applications were received to make it Pounds 880m. It is,for
the moment, the biggest UK investment trust launch ever.
However, itis likely to be overtaken within a month by the Mercury European
Privatisation Trust, which has already raised Pounds 325m through its
placing, and has set its limit at Pounds 575m. The public offer closes on
March 2, and is almost certain to be oversubscribed.
The previous record was set by the Mercury World Mining Trust last December,
which pulled in Pounds 425m. New investment trusts in 1993 raised arecord
total of Pounds 1.49bn, not including Lloyd's corporate capital investment
trusts, which pulled in Pounds 700m.
But Mr Nigel Sidebottom, of stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, who manages
private client funds invested in investment trusts, says investors are no
longer buying equity funds indiscriminately, as value is becoming harder to
find.
'My feeling is that the markets have had a pretty strong run over the last
12 to 18 months. Everybody is looking at it and saying, have I missed the
boat? They are looking for some angle, some story, whichmay outperform the
market. I think that is why they are focusing generally on funds which are
quite specialised - Mercury World Mining, the privatisation trusts, single
country funds, emerging markets.'
Specialist funds can give added value even to institutional investors, who
may manage more general portfolios themselves. Nearly all the new issues so
far this year are specialised in some way - single country, smaller
companies, privatisations or with a split capital structure. Country funds,
such as new trusts for Taiwan and Israel, give institutions a way into
markets which would otherwise be inaccessible or not cost effective to
research.
Investment trust shares traditionally trade at a discount to their net asset
value. Mr Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, says
discounts are at their narrowest for 20 years, and many trusts are at a
premium. Even Foreign &amp; Colonial, the oldest and largest investment trust,
has been trading at a premium, off and on, for the first time since 1972.
Buying investment trust shares at a premium is an expensive way into the
stock market - with some trusts, you would currently pay 15 per cent more
for the shares than the underlying assets are worth. It is also risky, as
the premium canbe wiped out in a day if sentiment changes.
With new issues, however, investors can get the same assets for virtually no
added cost. Most new trusts issue free warrants, often one for every five
shares, which acquire their own valueand compensate for the impact of issue
expenses. The same is true for conversion share issues by existing funds,
such as that currently under way for the Fleming Japanese trust. As long as
trusts are trading at a premium, new issues will keep on flowing.
The question now is whether the current climate can be sustained. A stock
market crash would obviously eliminate discounts, but the real threat to
fundamental demand is interest rates.
If interest rates went back to 10 per cent, individuals who had been putting
Pounds 100 a month into investment trust savings schemes could withdraw it
all and go back to the building society. 'That could push prices back to a
discount quite quickly,' says Mr Sidebottom. Even so, higher interest rates
would not necessarily mean the end of investment trusts' new-found
popularity with private investors.
'I think the equity market may have made a lot of permanent converts from
this period of low interest rates,' he says. Private investors may switch
much of their money back on to deposit when interest rates rise again, but
they may have overcome their fear of the markets sufficiently to leave a
portion of their savings in investmentor unit trusts.

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo pulls out of talks on Markham sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the oil explorationand development company, is pulling out of talks
to sell its interest in the Markham gas field in the North Sea, which was
put up for sale in March last year.
The company said that it had been able to raise sig-nificant funds from
other sources, including the Pounds 123m from the sale of offshore assets to
PowerGen in December.
Lasmo had been talking to Wintershall, the German gas company.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the company would only sell if a full
value could be realised. It did not think the offers received represented
this value.
He added that the value of the field, which straddles the UK and Dutch
sectors, had increased through improved performance and lower than expected
costs.

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Granada and Carlton can proceed with bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grana da's Pounds 650m hostile bid for LWT and Carlton's agreed Pounds 760m
acquisition of Central Independent Television were cleared by the Department
of Trade and Industry yesterday after the companies undertook to limit their
shares of the television advertising market.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the bids would not
be referred to the Monopolies Commission having acceptedundertakings from
the companies that they would not control more than 25 per cent of all UK
tele-vision net advertising revenue after August 31 1995.
The clearance restarted the clock on the Granada-LWT bid and allowed
Carlton's offer for Central to be declared unconditional in all respects. If
Granada's acquisition of LWT succeeds the combined group would control about
40 per cent of theITV advertising revenue and around 30 per cent of the
total television advertising market. Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief
executive, said it was too soon to say how its share would be reduced but:
'The chances of sorting it out in a neat way are very high.'
LWT replied that Granada would be required to abandon its joint sales house
with Scottish Television or break LWT's five-year contract with
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television.
Advertisers, who had feared that a concentration of advertising sales could
force up prices, gave the agreement a cautious welcome. However, Mr Ken
Miles, director general of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers,
said: 'We would have preferred to see it dealt with more quickly. Given the
uncertainty it would cause we would encourage them to anticipate the
timetable if the takeover does go ahead.'
Central and Carlton together control a little less than 25 per cent of total
UK television advertising though Anglia, which has a joint sales house with
Central, controls a further 5 per cent.
LWT has until midnight tomorrow to put out any new information. Granada will
then have a week to improve its offer with the final closing date 14 days
after that.

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National buys CIBC's residential
mortgage book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, has bought the Pounds
900m UK residential mortgage book of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Themortgage assets are equivalent to 2 per cent of Abbey's existing mortgage
assets, and were purchased at an undisclosed discount to the book value.
CIBC Mortgages has about 17,500 mortgage customers. These will benefit from
a 0.25 percentage points cut in the interest rate they pay, which will fall
to 8.2 per cent from March. Abbey National customers currently pay 7.74 per
cent.
The o peration employs 104 staff - most of them at Coventry - and will
continue to be run as a separate organisation from the bank itself, called
Abbey National Mortgage Finance.
Apart from increasing Abbey's mortgage assets, the acquisition will also
give it the capability to securitise future mortgages.
Securitisation involves the selling of 'packages' of mortgages to a vehicle
company, which issues bonds against them. It would allow the bank to devolve
credit risks to investors, and also raise its return on capital by
're-using' it as it would release capital that regulatory guidelines require
a bank to hold against assets.
The bank does not intend to securitise the existing business, but may move
down this route within the next couple of years.
An essentialpart of the process is computer systems that have sufficient
detailed information about individual mortgages to enable the payment risks
for each one to be assessed.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, highlighted the importance of thesystems
the bank was gaining as part of the deal. 'Setting these up from scratch
would be time-consuming and complex,' he said.
The purchase is the most conspicuous example of a recent trend among more
mainstream mortgage lenders to purchase the books of some lenders who
entered the UK housing market in the 1980s and no longer see it as central
to their business.
Within the past year or so, Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th-largest
society, has bought four mortgage books amounting to Pounds 295m.
Mr Dan Ferguson, European vice-president of CIBC, said the departure from
the UK residential mortgage market, which CIBC entered in 1986, 'is
reflective of our previously announced decision to exit those of our
European operations which are not a core component of our global investment
and wholesale banking lines of business'.

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Intl Food requests suspension of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in International Food Machinery, the troubled second-hand catering
equipment supplier, were suspended yesterday on the Stock Exchange.
A statement by the Humberside group said the temporary suspension was made
at its own request 'pending clarification of the company's financial
position'.
The announcement followed a profits warning last November, when the company
said its results for the year to December would be substantially below
market expectations.
Although IFM last year reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 878,000
(Pounds 292,000) on turnover of Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 3.39m), it subsequently
ran into overstocking problems and debts mounted to more than Pounds 3m.
Since then the share price has tumbled from 80p and was suspended yesterday
at 14p.

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Interest costs keep Birse in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birse Group, the building and civil engineering company, yesterday announced
a return to operating profit for the six months to October 1993, after two
years of losses.
The recovery was led by increased activity from the company's construction
division, but interest payments of Pounds 1.98m resulted in a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 1.4m, compared with a Pounds 2.71m loss a year earlier. Operating
profit amounted to Pounds 580,000 (Pounds 429,000 loss).
Birse announced a Pounds 24m placement in December, to counter the impact of
write-downs on its property portfolio and the effects of collapsing profit
margins on its construction business.
Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said: 'We've bottomed out, I think, but how
quickly the recovery will happen is still in doubt.'
Turnover increased by 20.5 per cent to Pounds 197.3m. The rise was wholly
accounted for by Birse Construction, which reported a Pounds 774,000 profit,
against a loss of Pounds 615,000 a year earlier.
Mr Birse said the company had started to push into more stable sectors of
the construction industry, primarily public sector contracts such as
schools, hospitals and refurbishment of council estates.
With its strengthened balance sheet, Birse has been able to compete more
strongly for new contracts, and this should result in a stronger order book
over the next three months.
The company's plant hire business remained profitable at the interim stage,
and Birse's housebuilding business recorded its first operating profit.
Birse has decided to wind down its commercial property development and
investment business over the next two years.
The portfolio is valued at Pounds 30m, and reflects present market values,
so this would enable the group to reduce net debt from its current level of
Pounds 17.3m. Losses per share amounted to 2.1p (3.6p).

FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bletchley seeks Pounds 5m and forecasts
profits advance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bletchley Motor Group is calling for Pounds 5m after expenses via a placing
and open offer of 1.53m new ordinary shares at 340p each.
The proceeds of the issue will be used primarily to provide finance for the
development of a multi-franchise site at Milton Keynes and the development
of a new dealership at Letchworth.
Kleinwort Benson Securities has entered into an agreement to procure placees
for the shares which will then be subject to a clawback by existing
shareholders on a 1-for-3 basis.
In a trading statement Bletchley directors estimated that profits before tax
for the year to end-December would be not less than Pounds 1.75m, an
improvement of 43 per cent over last time's Pounds 1.23m.
Their intention was to propose a final dividend of 5.1p (4.4p) to make a
9.85p (8.8p) total. The new ordinary shares under the open offer would rank
for the forecast final dividend.
Bletchley continued to see a 'steady growth' in sales during 1993 with all
divisions performing well. Vehicle sales were 'very encouraging' with an
aggregate increase in volume of some 20 per cent over the previous year.
The shares closed 10p higher at 375p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unprecedented demand for shares in the European privatisation trusts
being launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management is good news
for both fund management groups. Managing such large amounts of money,
however, could bring its problems, particularly if the managers were not
expecting to be operating on that scale.
Between them, the two trusts will be bigger than all the existing UK-listed
general European investment trusts put together. The largest fund in the
sector at the moment is the Fleming Continental European fund, with assets
of Pounds 236.3m.
Mercury has more than Pounds 55bn of assets under management, while
Kleinwort Benson has Pounds 12bn. Although neither group has an existing
European investment trust, both have unit trusts in that area. Their
performance is largely lacklustre.
Kleinwort Benson's European trust, which had assets of Pounds 104m at the
end of last year, ranked 103 out of 125 in its sector in the year to January
1, and 78 out of 92 over five years. Kleinwort's European Special trust is
smaller, at about Pounds 20m, but its performance record is similar.
Mercury's European Growth trust, which has assets of Pounds 203.5m, ranked
51 over one year and 42 over five years.
The Mercury New Europe trust, run by the same manager as the privatisation
trust, Mr Paul Harwood, was only launched in March 1992, but ranked a
slightly more encouraging 13 over one year. It has a net asset value of more
than Pounds 40m.
Mr Harwood has been specialising in European equities since 1991, but before
that his career at Mercury and Newton Investment Management was mostly in UK
equities and fixed interest. He will be assisted by Mercury's 15-person
European team, who are also responsible for the unit trusts and
institutional funds.
The day-to-day manager and stock selector for the Kleinwort trust is to be
Ms Vicky Sleddon. She has been working in European equities since 1990,
managing institutional equity accounts, a Spanish equity fund and a
convertible bond fund, but this is her first large European retail fund.
Overall investment strategy will be the responsibility of Mr Kenneth King,
head of international equities. He has been at Kleinwort since 1989, and was
previously with NM Rothschild.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Tidal wave of dirty water: Falling standards in UK public
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High standards in the public services are like clean water, according to
Professor Peter Hennessy, the historian and veteran Whitehall watcher. You
only realise their value when they've gone.
If so, there are worrying signs ofcontamination appearing in the UK water
supply. Consider some examples:
Fraud squad detectives have been called into the Welsh health promotion
quango toinvestigate foreign travel expenses.
The Wessex regional health authoritywasted at least Pounds 20m on a
computerisation project that was later abandoned. Serious conflicts of
interest were uncovered in the commissioning process.
The employment department has been unable to provide auditors with adequate
evidence that almost Pounds 80m paid out for employment training was
properly spent.
The National Audit Office, Parliament's public expenditure watchdog, found
weaknesses in the financial controls of schools that have opted out of local
authority control, including in procedures for authorising payments.
Ten days ago, the powerful Commons public accounts committee, which monitors
government finances, published a brief but scorching attack on the decline
of standards in theconduct of public business. It cited 17 of its own
studies over the past four years that indicated serious failings in the
handling of public money.
MrRobert Sheldon, the committee's chairman for 11 years, said the frequency
of such cases in recent years indicated that something was going wrong. He
warned that they might be the tip of an iceberg.
Even the Treasury, the bastion of financial rectitude, has not escaped
censure by the committee. Losses of almost Pounds 1m have been clocked up in
its catering agency, Forward Civil Service Catering, through 'poor control,
mismanagement, irregularity, malpractice and fraud'.
Mr Sheldon made much of the link between the decline in standards and
themanagement reforms carried out in Whitehall over the past 15 years. The
creation of executive agencies, the growth in contracting-out, the
delegation of responsibilities to local offices and the encouragement of a
more entrepreneurial approach by managers are all blamed for the rising tide
of financial scandals.
All of these create opportunities for mistakes to be made, money to be
wasted and corruption to sneak into the system, according to Sir John Bourn,
head of the National Audit Office. He told MPs this week that the delegation
of financial responsibility away from Whitehall was in some cases leaving
inexperienced staffin charge of large sums of public money.
Such problems were compounded,Sir John said, when managers were brought in
from the private sector to run public services without being briefed on the
procedures for handling public money and parliamentary ac-countability. One
agency chief executive he investigated hadasked: 'Why are you doing this to
me?'
It is a fair point: many of themisdemeanours that Sir John has highlighted
would hardly raise an eyebrow in the private sector.
The Welsh Development Agency, for example, was censuredfor a long list of
offences, including serious conflicts of interest. But the charge sheet
included the payment of excessive redundancy payments, use of Concorde for
transatlantic flights and the provision of cars for executives without
requiring them to pay for private motoring. The agency's record in grabbing
20 percent of the UK's inward investment for just 5 per cent of the
population counted for nothing against such errors.
Yet career civil servants know that handling public money is not the same as
handling private money. The rules are different because it is taxpayers'
money they are spending, says Mr Richard Mottram, the permanent secretary in
charge of public sector reform at the Cabinet Office. Taxpayers have no
choice but to pay their taxes; they want to know that it isnot being spent
in ways they would disapprove of.
That truth is instilled in those who have worked in the civil service all
their working lives. A senior civil servant in charge of an agency puts it
like this: 'There is a reflex that twitches whenever you spend public money.
You think to yourself 'What would it look like in The Sun?' '
That reflex does not come naturally to business executives brought in to run
public services, ac-cording to Mr Derek Lewis, the chief executive of the
Prison Service who used to run leisure group Granada. More needs to be done,
he believes, to explain the different rules to newcomerslike himself.
'Controls on spending and finances in the private sector operatemuch more on
a bottom-line basis,' he says. 'There is less concern over how amanager uses
funds if he sticks within the total.
'Government rules paya lot of attention to the specific categories of
spending, with complicated andrestrictive rules for moving money from one
budget to another.'
Mr Lewis is regarded as one of the most successful transplants from the
private sector. But he says that the degree of scrutiny in the public sector
takes some gettingused to. 'A company is largely in control of the occasions
when it accounts for its performance. There is no closed season in the
public sector - you are continuously accountable.'
The many dimensions of public accountability arestressed by Mr Michael
Bichard, former chief executive of Gloucestershire county council who now
runs the Benefits Agency, which pays pensions and social security benefits.
He finds he is accountable to the social security department, the Treasury,
the Citizen's Charter unit, the ombudsman, MPs, select committees, themedia,
the general public and, of course, his customers. 'Having worked in
thepublic sector myself, it didn't surprise me,' he says. 'But I know that
comesas a shock to those coming in from the private sector.'
This unfamiliarity with the requirements of public accountability is
confirmed by Dr Elizabeth Mellon of the London Business School, who has
followed the civil service reformsclosely. 'Interviews with agency chief
executives from outside the civil service early in their new jobs showed
evidence of lack of clear briefing or even contact from permanent
secretaries.'
But Dr Mellon sees the growth of financial scandals more as a consequence of
government attempts to change the cultureof the civil service. An increasing
focus on results is replacing a concern forthe processes by which decisions
are taken. As a result, the complex checks andbalances that ensure probity
in spending public money - evolved over 140 years - are neglected.
'Inevitably, people will cut corners whenit is results which have become
most important,' she says.
The CabinetOffice's Mr Mottram concedes that more needs to be done to
explain the procedures and ensure that adequate systems for monitoring
spending are in place. In doing this, the PAC report will be helpful, he
says, because it identifies the failings that have led to mismanagement and
fraud.
But he warns against 20:20hindsight: 'If we want a less risk-averse culture,
people should be allowed tomake legitimate mistakes without being held up to
ridicule.'
The difficult line to be drawn in these instances, however, is that between
legitimate mistakes and those that are unacceptable to the taxpayer. Cross
that line, and thewater starts to look very murky indeed.

FT  05 FEB 94 / In the bear's shadow: The security concerns facing the
winner of tomorrow's Finnish presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Nuijamaa, a crossing point on Finland's frontier with Russia about 200km
north-west of St Petersburg, the rantings of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
Russian ultra-nationalist, seem little more than a distant echo in the chill
winter air.
With the temperature at -20'C, even in a dazzling midday sun, all that
disturbs a sparkling scene of snow-draped forest and frozen lakes is the
rumble of heavy trucks plying back and forth between the Russian giant and
its little western neighbour.
'We are proud of how few incidents we have along this border,' says Capt
Janne Piiroinen of the Finnish Border Guards. But he is not complacent. 'The
border is more interestingnow. Russia is boiling. You don't know what will
happen next.'
The youngofficer's attitude neatly sums up Finland's position, as the
initial optimism generated by the end of the cold war gives way to renewed
uncertainty over Russia's future posture.
The question of how Finland - which is seeking membership of the European
Union - manages its delicate position between west and east will be the
dominant issue for the winner of tomorrow's contest for the Finnish
presidency between Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a seasoned United Nations diplomat,
and Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defence minister. Directing foreign policy is
the mainrole played by the president under Finland's constitution.
Undoubtedly, the rise of strident Russian nationalism symbolised by Mr
Zhirinovsky is worryingfor Finland. The country broke free from Russian rule
only in 1917 and fought twice between 1939 and 1944 against Soviet forces to
preserve its independence, much of the fighting taking place in the Karelia
region around Nuijamaa.
Two years ago, alarm bells began to sound in Helsinki when Mr Zhirinovsky's
partyincluded Finland on its list of countries that should be brought back
under Moscow's rule. Last year, for good measure, Mr Zhirinovsky declared
that a country with a woman as defence minister did not deserve to be
independent.
The Finnish reaction has been deliberately cautious. Neither Mr Ahtisaari
nor MrsRehn, who are running neck-and-neck in the opinion polls, have dwelt
on the 'Zhirinovsky question' in the presidential campaign. They stress
their commitmentto Finland's security, but prefer to emphasise the Russian
government's declarations of commitment to democratic reform than Mr
Zhirinovsky's utterances.
Finland is well aware of its vulnerable position alongside such a mighty
power. It learnt the benefits during the postwar period - in terms of
national security but also in terms of trade - of maintaining its neutrality
while cultivating friendly ties with the communists in Moscow.
It is being careful now not to prejudice its relations with a more
aggressive regime that may in the future take power in Russia. Suggestions
that Finland might abandon its neutrality infavour of some alliance with
Nato tend to be side-stepped by politicians and officials alike.
But Helsinki is nevertheless making an unmistakeable strategic shift in its
application to join the EU - a move supported by both Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs
Rehn.
Mr Max Jacobson, a former ambassador to the UN, describes Finnish membership
of the EU as an 'insurance policy' against what he calls'the tremendous
uncertainties' of the future. 'What gave us an advantage in the cold war
period was the fact that there was a balance of power in Europe. The
Russians had to take into account western reactions to whatever they did
towards Finland. The west accepted our reservations about participation in
western organisations.
'We now have to consider the possibility that the west won'tbe so interested
in what may happen in eastern Europe. If we choose to stay outside the EU,
what obligations would the western countries feel towards us?'
Opinion polls suggest that fear of what may transpire in Russia is
bolstering pro-EU opinion in Finland. If negotiations on an accession
agreement - being conducted in parallel with those of fellow-applicants
Austria, Norway and Sweden - are completed by the March deadline, a
referendum to decide the issue will be held by the end of this year.
But a clear path to membership is still byno means assured. There is a
significant camp in Finland that argues that the country should stay outside
the EU and unambiguously neutral precisely because itmay one day again find
itself squeezed between mutually hostile western and eastern powers.
Negotiations with Brussels on entry terms are also complicated by deep
differences over subsidies for Finnish agriculture, which Helsinki wants
treated under the Common Agricultural Policy as a special Nordic category.
The rurally rooted Centre party of Prime Minister Esko Aho is split on the
EU issue and could not accept an accession agreement seen to disadvantage
Finnish farmers.
If a crisis over accession terms does blow up in the next month, the new
president could immediately be faced with a splintering of Mr Aho's
Centre-Conservative coalition on the EU issue.
However, if such pitfalls are avoided and Finland joins the EU, the
1,200km-long border Capt Piiroinen helps patrol will become the Union's
first direct frontier with Russia and Finland's border problems will also
become Brussels'.
In that case, the message from the Finnish side is so far reassuring.
Concerns after the collapse of the Soviet Unionthat a flood of hungry
refugees might pour over the low fence that marks the border have proved
groundless. The number of illegal border crossings in Capt Piiroinen's 25km
sector has more than than halved since 1990 to a paltry 20 last year. 'We
were very worried about that - but it just hasn't happened,' he says.
The number of smuggling cases has doubled, with 120 serious incidents -
involving mainly illicit pharmaceuticals and precious metals - recorded
along the southern 500km sector of the frontier last year. But customs
officials say co-operation with the Russian authorities is good and
improving.
Above all, the local economy in the border area is benefiting from a growth
in private cross-border trade, which barely existed before the disappearance
of the Soviet regime.
In Lappeenranta, the main Finnish border city, telecommunications and postal
links have been set up with St Petersburg. This has enabled more than100
foreign companies working in the Russian city to maintain reliable
communications with their home bases. Transit trade has blossomed since 1991
and grew bymore than 300 per cent last year.
Used cars alone are being bought and taken back across the border by
Russians at the rate of more than 3,000 a month. 'We have seen buses with 30
Russians arrive in the morning from St Petersburg and return empty followed
by 30 newly-purchased cars, all bought with cash,' saysMr Jarmo Pirhonen,
head of the local chamber of commerce.
He has a sanguine view of the future. 'We have to be realistic - we can't
change our geography and there is no benefit in being afraid. Of course we
are a little bit worried. But I think whatever happens in Russia, trade will
go on, because they really need it.'

<TEXT>
Sir, What's up doc? I am] It is 2.20 am and I cannot sleep. But then I am a
GP. I received my second call since I came to bed at 1.30am, from a patient
who couldn't get to sleep. This was my third night without sleep.
I suggested she could have contacted me at the surgery yesterday, or later
today, and I could have provided her with appropriate treatment, but her
problem was now.
I pointed out that she was asking me to get up and visit her in the middle
of the night because she couldn't sleep and needed to get up for work in the
morning. I could not take a sleeping tablet in case I was called out again.
I had to get up for work in the morning as well. She had no response to
this.
So I went to see her and gave her her sleeping tablet. I hope she is asleep,
because I'm not.
Dr Julia Riley, I heartily agree with you. It is time our patients began to
take some responsibility for their own health and not pass it all on to the
doctor.

<TEXT>
Sir, After the prominence given to a long-winded whinge about the hours GPs
work ('What's up doc?', January 29/30) can we look forward to an uninspiring
series of moans from other professionals? Surveyors spend hours out of doors
in all weathers; lawyers may have to associate with the wrong sort;
academics spend holidays marking exam scripts.
Doctors who opt for general practice contract to provide 24-hour cover for
their patients. They know their hours will be stretched, but generous pay
levels reflect the inconvenience of occasional disrupted sleep. If a doctor
finds being on call too demanding, he or she has the wherewithal to purchase
cover from a deputising service.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A worrying shift in employment
patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GABRIELLE COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If Samuel Brittan were to examine the employment rather than the
unemployment figures he might feel less sanguine about recovery ('Evidence
for a real recovery at last', January 31).
Employment began to rise in March 1993. The latest figures (Department of
Employment Gazette, January 1994) show that between March and September last
year employment rose by 94,000. This was made up of a rise of 76,000
part-time male jobs and 114,000 part-time female jobs and a fall of 87,000
full-time male jobs and 9,000 full-time female jobs. The net result (apart
from a further shift from male to female employment) was a fall of 96,000
full-time jobs and a rise of 190,000 part-time jobs. Part-timers work on
average 15.2 hours per week.
Even if two part-time jobs were equivalent to one full-time job there would
still be a deficit of 1,000 jobs over the period.
Many part-time jobs pay less than the National Insurance threshold, forcing
families into dependence on means-tested benefits, and increasing the fiscal
problems caused by a growing social security bill and a smaller tax-paying
workforce. Only 40.5 per cent of households in the UK have a head of
household in full-time work, compared with 49 per cent in 1981-82.
In the north-west in the first six months of 1993 we lost a further 4 per
cent of our manufacturing jobs, and since then a number of leading employers
(such as British Aerospace and Ferranti) have announced significant job
losses. Surveys of manufacturers' order books and output do not count all
those who have gone out of business since the previous survey.
The apparently inexorable shifts from manufacturing to service sectors, from
male to female and from full-time to part-time employment ought to be
raising serious worries not only about the economy but about the future of
society as a whole.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flaws and breach of trust behind BT
performance related pay scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with some concern Robert Taylor's report on the complexities of
BT's performance related pay scheme ('Must try harder', February 2). I would
like to add three points.
First, BT's own pay comparison study is seriously flawed, being based on
crude and implausible averages, with no consideration given to length of
service, distribution, population change, performance profiles or relative
expectations.
Even more astonishingly, although BT describes it as comprehensive, it in
fact fails to cover more than half the managerial and professional jobs in
BT.
Second, BT's recently discovered ambition to go down market implies it
understands its position in the labour market it talks about. There is no
evidence of this. BT's casual disregard of the prospect of its more talented
managers leaving is evidence of its down-market approach. This cannot
inspire the customers whose business it needs to win.
Finally, it is a pretty fundamental breach of trust if BT, after telling
people they will be paid for their performance, then suspends the
performance pay scheme. BT's profits this year will increase to more than
Pounds 3bn. For it to say to its 26,000 managers and professionals that 10
per cent of them can share Pounds 2m as a consolidated pay increase is
grossly insulting. It is, after all, considerably less than the BT board
paid itself last year.
We must not let our concern with the complex mechanics of performance pay
schemes blind us to the simple truth that mistakes of this magnitude totally
destroy any prospect of performance pay improving performance.

Sir, The article by Colin Amery, 'Smiting the Philistines' (Arts, January

all lovers of this unique heritage should heed.
When in 1969 I undertook articles with a City firm of chartered accountants,
the only advice I received from my father, who had trained likewise in his
time, was: 'Take time off to see the City churches.' I happily followed his
advice, visiting all 39 of them, John Betjeman's guide in hand, and singing
in both of the two then remaining City church choirs. It was the most

FT  05 FEB 94 / Pet owners in the dog-house: The growing calls to banish
canines from China's cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dog-lover Lai Mincheng is not a happy man these days in spite of the
approach of the Year of the Dog according to the oriental lunar calendar.
With scant regard for sentiment, People's Daily, the Communist party
newspaper, has railed against dog-ownership, adding its stern voice to
growing calls to rid Chinese cities of man's best friend.
Pet dogs should be banished, the paper said, because they 'spread rabies and
threaten people's lives . . . urinate and defecate everywhere . . . bark and
yelp, scaring people and biting people'.
Mr Lai, senior veterinarian at Beijing General Pets Hospital, fears that
such prejudices will rebound against efforts by dog-owners to persuade
people that theirs is a harmless hobby. 'I hardly have the heart to go to
work these days,' he said.
Not since the 1950s and 1960s has the party newspaper been quite so unkind
about the humble canine. Dogs were banned from most Chinese cities after the
Communists took over, determined to build a new and healthy society. During
the Cultural Revolution, Mr Lai hid his pet birds under his bed because
owning pets was considered bourgeois and decadent.
Some of those dark memories have been revived recently with reports of dogs
being taken forcibly away from tearful owners. Mr Lai recalls individual
acts of resistance with satisfaction. In one case a woman threatened to jump
out the window of her high-rise apartment rather than give up her dog.
Before the Year of the Rooster gives way to the Year of the Dog next
Thursday, uncertainty surrounds the fate of Beijing's pampered pooches.
Government curbs, to be known by the bleak title of 'Regulations on Pets:
Sanitation Control', are expected to place a limit on the size of dogs -
ownership would be restricted to small breeds such as terriers - and would
also make parks and public areas off-limits to dogs.
The new rules will hit China's emerging, moneyed middle class, which is
largely responsible for dog-ownership becoming first a fad and then a craze
in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Canines of dubious parentage have been
changing hands for hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of dollars.
Russian traders have been a chief source of supply, smuggling puppies past
border guards and selling them in Chinese markets, or bartering them for
garments or cloth. The main problem with smuggled Russian dogs, as far as
the Chinese authorities are concerned, is that apart from the avoidance of
quarantine controls, these animals tend to grow from cute little bundles of
fur into large and noisy mastiffs.
The multiplying number of dogs on the streets has prompted a vigorous, if
one-sided, debate in official newspapers. Typical was a long letter
published in the English-language China Daily in which a reader, Mr Zhang
Huimin, described dog-ownership as 'deplorably out of harmony with a China
that is still poor and trying to ensure a better standard of living for
all'.
Mr Zhang reported with 'disgust' a recent episode in which he had observed
'a not-too-clean-looking, curly-haired dog stop at the trunk of a young tree
and unblushingly lift its short and fat hind leg high to send out a yellow
jet of water'.
Such graphic descriptions clearly struck a chord with Mr Cheng Musheng, a
local Beijing legislator, who said he would be urging the authorities to
pass an ordinance forthwith to ban 'noisy and dirty' dogs.
Mr Zhang was also outraged by the spectacle of dog-owners lavishing special
care and attention on their pets, including visits to dog beauty parlours.
At Beijing's K P K World Pet Zoo Co Ltd - the capital's premier pet emporium
 -which advertises a range of pet-care services including 'cosmetic
beautifying' - the mood is gloomy as business has dipped sharply since dogs
found themselves, well, in the dog-house with the authorities.
People were visiting the store to look but not to buy, said Mr Liu Xuelu,
the manager. 'These days only those who are opposed to dogs get the right to
speak in the media. Others don't,' he said.
Attitudes were less antagonistic under the rule of China's emperors and
empresses, many of them noted dog-lovers. The Manchu Empress Dowager Ci Xi,
whose devotion to Pekinese dogs was legendary, was said to have laid down
the breed standard for the palace dogs as rigidly as she laid down the law
for her humblest subjects on the remote frontiers of Tibet. 'Let the lion
dog be small, with the selling cape of dignity round its neck and billowing
standard of pomp above its back,' she declared.
China's modern leaders have shown no such conspicuous affection for the
four-legged creatures. Unlike in the west, dog-ownership is not yet
considered a useful political prop in China - but times change.
Mr Lai might be rather gloomy about the present chill towards man's best
friend, but he believes dog-lovers will prevail. 'It's become an historical
tide,' he says.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Defence may be the best attack: Paul Betts and Tony Jackson
ask whether BAe's strategy of returning to its roots will reap long-term
rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, this has been a brilliant week for British Aerospace. On
Monday morning, it announced the Pounds 800m sale of Rover to BMW. Since
then, its shares have risen 30 per cent, adding more than Pounds 500m to its
market value. With one bold stroke, BAe has returned to its roots: not
merely as an aircraft manufacturer, but - more important - as one of the
UK's main defence contractors.
There are two snags. First, the defence industry - in Europe especially - is
becoming ever more viciously competitive. Second, success in defence
requires financial clout: that is, a strong balance sheet. As part of the
Rover deal, BAe wrote off Pounds 450m. Yesterday it wrote off another Pounds
250m on its turboprop aircraft business. In the course of a single week, its
balance sheet has shrunk by more than a third.
Despite the cash BAe is getting on the Rover deal, it may not have the
resources to develop its defence business alone. The obvious answer, as BAe
chief executive Mr Dick Evans told the Financial Times this week, is for BAe
ultimately to combine in some way with the UK's other big defence
contractor, Lord Weinstock's cash-rich GEC.
The scale of the challenge in defence is simply put. Since the end of the
cold war, the US has adopted a more liberal attitude to military sales. As a
result, its share of the world's defence exports has doubled. From anaverage
of about Dollars 6bn a year before 1989, the figure is now Dollars 15bn. On
the otherside of the coin, European defence exports have halved from Dollars
10bn-Dollars 12bn a year before the Berlin Wall came down to Dollars
4bn-Dollars 5bn today.
In addition, one of BAe's most prized customers shows signs of losing
interest. BAe has enjoyed a long and lucrative relationship with Saudi
Arabia. Last year alone, it sold the kingdom Tornado aircraft worth Pounds
4bn. There are now signs that military exports tothe Middle East have
peaked, at least for the next three or four years, thus forcing BAe and
other competing contractors to seek new markets in the Far East.
For the company's top management, led by Mr Evans, the picture looks rather
different. On their version of events, it has been a long, hard slog from
thebrink of the precipice. For the past two years, amid continuing internal
tensions, Mr Evans and his team have fulfilled step by step the recovery
strategy broadly set out by the company after the forced resignation two
years ago of Professor Sir Roland Smith, BAe's controversial chairman.
This has involved sweeping restructuring in both the defence and commercial
sides of the company's aerospace activities, with more than 25,000 job
losses and the closure of three historic plants: Kingston, Hatfield and
Preston. So-called non-core businesses havebeen shed to raise cash and
cancel debt.
Now it has unshackled itself of its automobile operations. 'Some while ago
it was already pretty clear to us that it would have been difficult to
support both the aerospace and car side of our businesses in the second half
of the decade,' explains Mr Evans. 'We decided to exit the car business
towards the end of the decade but then we were made a remarkable,
unconditional offer from BMW.'
So far, so good. But where do the events of the past few days leave the
company that once harboured the ambition of combining with Daimler-Benz of
Germany to create, in Sir Roland's words, 'the General Motors of Europe'?
At the time of BAe's Rover acquisition in 1988, it was fashionable for large
car companies to diversify into aerospace. GM bought Hughes; Ford invested
heavily in aerospace; Daimler-Benz took charge of the restructuring of the
German aerospace industry by creating asubsidiary called Deutsche Aerospace.
For BAe, the logic of buying Rover was not so much industrial as financial.
The acquisition virtually doubled the company's asset base overnight. With
shareholders' funds increasing from Pounds 1.1bn in 1987 to Pounds 2.2bn the
following year and annual sales jumping from Pounds 4.1bn to about Pounds
9bn,BAe significantly reinforced its financial firepower to support its
defence exports.
The military side, where exports account for more than 70 per centof sales,
has traditionally been the company's biggest source of profit. By contrast,
commercial aerospace activities have been a steady drain. Between 1981 and
1992, the commercial aerospace business, including BAe's regional jets,
turbopropeller commuter aircrafts and a 20 per cent stake in the European
Airbus largeairliner programme, lost Pounds 1bn, according to Mr Keith
Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at US broker Shearson Lehman.
With the sale of Rover, BAe is back to square one. Shareholders' funds are
now expected to drop to about Pounds 1.2bn andsales this year to about
Pounds 5.5bn, from Pounds 1.78bn and nearly Pounds 10bn respectively in
1992. Mr Evans argues that the sale has strengthened the company's financial
base to support its core business. 'The Rover sale will free off a lot of
banking capacity which had been devoted to Rover. It will release something
in excess of Pounds 2bn, reduce our gearing and help us achieve our
longer-term plans for aerospace.'
At present, Mr Evans says BAe has no plans to seek fresh funds from
shareholders to bolster the company's balance sheet. Instead, the company
will shed inessential assets. The next target will be BAe's Arlington
Securities property interests, bought during Sir Roland's acquisition spree
in the late 1980s.
The other immediate priority is to halt the financial haemorrhage from civil
aerospace. Although Airbus faces a difficult few years as a result of the
sharp fall in the airliner market and increased competition from Boeing, its
bigger US rival, Mr Evans believes Airbus is 'without a shadow of doubt an
excellent business' with good long-term growth prospects. However, he admits
the jury is still out on the future of BAe's regional and commuter aircraft
activities.
A year ago, BAe tried to resolve the financial problems of its BAe 146
regional jet operations by negotiating a joint venture with Taiwan. But
negotiations have been at a standstill for several months and the proposed
deal now looksincreasingly likely to collapse.
However, while negotiating with Taiwan,BAe cracked down on the cost base of
its regional jet operations based at Woodford, near Manchester, and took a
Pounds 1bn provision to cover the liabilities on aircraft leases as well as
the eventual closure of the 146 line.
Mr Evans says the restructuring has helped enhance the performance of the
regional jetbusiness, enabling the company to maintain this activity as it
seeks out other partners. 'The urgent job now is to find a way forward for
our turboprops,' heexplains.
The company yesterday took a first big step in addressing the problems of
its turboprop Jetstream operations, now concentrated at Prestwick, Scotland,
and expected to show an operating loss of about Pounds 120m in 1993. It
announced it would make a Pounds 250m provision to cover turboprop leasing
liabilities.
'What we are ultimately envisaging is the creation of a joint venture inthe
regional and commuter aircraft sector in which we would own a 20-25 per cent
stake of the business,' Mr Evans says. Although several City aerospace
observers would prefer to see BAe withdraw from the turboprop and regional
jet market,Mr Evans still believes there are opportunities.
'The question is whether we can be part of an organisation that dominates
this market. You have to benumber one: it's no good being in the second
division,' he insists. BAe is thus looking at possible alliances with
Aerospatiale of France, Fokker, the Dutch group now controlled by Deutsche
Aerospace, and McDonnell Douglas of the US, which is planning to develop a
100-seat version of its MD90 twin engine jet called the MD95.
One thing is sure: commercial aircraft activities must stop sapping the
profits of BAe's defence business, Mr Evans stresses. But even if BAe
resolves the problems of its civil aerospace operations, it must still
establish its defence business on a more competitive footing in the
post-cold war world.
BAe's military aircraft activities, whose spiritual heart is at Warton,
Lancashire, are widely recognised as being world class. But industrial
excellence and total design capability are no longer enough without scale
and financial muscle. Mr Evans has long been convinced that there will be a
shake-out in the European industry. 'The Americans are already much further
down the road of consolidation and the Europeans will have to respond,' he
says.
BAe is already in advanced negotiations to merge its guided weapons
activities with those of the French Matra-Hachette group - though even that
combination will be dwarfed bythe two leading US missiles groups, Hughes and
Raytheon.
Uncertainties also abound for BAe on existing programmes, most notably on
the Eurofighter 2000 due to make its maiden flight in April. BAe
acknowledges that this first flight will be psychologically crucial for the
aircraft's controversial Pounds 10bn development programme, on which much of
the future prospects of BAe's military aircraft production hinge.
'Eurofighter is bloody important, but in defence, politics has always been
the problem,' Mr Evans says, referring to Germany's continuing hesitations.
The ultimate answer to all this could lie in one of the most dramatic
mergers in UK corporate history. BAe and GEC, the two dominant UK defence
companies, are in many ways natural partners. The idea of putting them
together has been in the air since the early 1980s. Sir Raymond Lygo, former
BAe chief executive, had actively sought a merger between the two companies
before being turned down by his board.
The companies are already working together on naval systems and joined
forces two years ago in an unsuccessfulbid for the prime contract on the
Royal Navy's EH101 anti-submarine helicopters.
Last summer, BAe and Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, again held
talks to see if the two companies could combine their defence activities
into a single group. To Lord Weinstock's particular annoyance, the talks
were blown off course when the news leaked out in the Sunday Times.
Although BAe is at present not involved in any talks with GEC - 'we've got
enough on our plate at the moment', says Mr Evans - the company sees a
link-up as inevitable.
'It is not if, it is a question of when,' Mr Evans says. 'The fact of the
matter is that the UK customer, HMG, cannot afford to sustain a competitive
policy among UK companies.' If the UK wants to maintain its market position
and remain the best defence contracting country in Europe, Mr Evans argues,
it will have to form a bigger entity to face international competition.
GEC, with its cash hoard, would provide a more logical alternative to Rover
in BAe's quest for size. Between them, they would constitute the world's
second-biggest defence group after Martin Marietta of the US. While the
Rover sale thus marks the end of a short and troubled era in the company's
history, a link-up with GEC could finally secure BAe's long-term future as a
world-class defence contractor.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A tale of two mice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In his speech to the annual banquet of the Bankers Club at London's
Guildhall on Tuesday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan warned that
disturbances in one country were all too rapidly transmitted through the
world economy in today's global markets. His remarks were made in the
context of the risks inherent in the growing trade in derivative
instruments, which were subsequently credited with pushing the FT-SE 100
index to a record highon Wednesday. But the point applies with equal force
to the cash markets; and it sounded uncomfortably relevant after yesterday's
news of a tightening in US monetary policy.
A change in the direction of monetary policy is more often than not an
indicator of a market turning point. The conventional wisdom aboutthe
overblown condition of equity and bond markets worldwide has been that, once
US interest rates rise, funds are likely to flow out of Europe and the Far
East back to the US. This would be a natural response to a change in yield
differentials and any tendency for the dollar to strengthen. Yet the bigger
worry has always concerned the impact of higher US interest rates on small
investors, especially the elderly, who have been taking money out of bank
deposits and putting them into mutual funds without appreciating how far
they are exposing themselves to market risk.
Much of the buoyancy of bond and share prices outside the US has stemmed
from American portfolio diversification; part of it reflects a significant
spillover from the mutual fund bubble. If the unsophisticated folk panic
when they discover that their capital is suddenly being eroded by falling
share and bond prices, money could pour out of foreign as well as domestic
markets back into the US banking system - or so the argument runs.
Considerable pressure
Yet all that has been mooted so far is a small increase in short-term money
market rates. That falls short of the kind of grinding gear change that
brings about a crash, or even a sharp correction. And as Sushil Wadhwani
andMushtaq Shah of Goldman Sachs point out in a well-timed circular, past
evidencesuggests that individual investors are anyway slow to react to
changes in interest rates, especially when the increases are not large. Mr
Greenspan, who is under considerable pressure from both Congress and the
administration not to brake too hard, appears not only to have produced a
mouse, but a politically correct mouse at that. Even the smallest and
friendliest of rodents have been known to frighten elderly widows. But there
is no real case here for panic.
Mr Greenspan's move is undeniably justified by the strength of the US
recovery and the near certainty that the gap between actual and potential
output will disappear this year, giving rise to inflationary pressure.
A more difficult questionis whether his UK counterpart, Mr Eddie George, has
been right to hold back from a further fall in British interest rates. In
real terms, UK rates are much higher than US rates were at the comparable
stage of economic recovery. Yet fiscal policy is about to tighten abruptly
in April. Sterling has been strengthening against the D-Mark and the
economies of Britain's main trading partners in Europe remain depressed.
Sustained growth
On Tuesday Mr George offered plenty of optimism, arguing that the prospects
for sustained growth in output and gradually falling unemployment were
better than at any time in his professional career. This he based on the
central bankerly conviction that low inflation and growth go hand in hand.
Yet he did not promise an interest rate cut, despite thefavourable
inflationary backdrop.
There is no shortage of indicators that point to accelerating recovery,
ranging from falling unemployment to December's soaring car sales. Yet many
of the indicators turn out to be less substantialthan they seem - witness
yesterday's bank lending figures. These showed the largest quarterly
increase for three years, at Pounds 5.4bn.
Yet on closer examination the greater part of that increase came from the
rise in lending to the financial sector, with growth in lending to the
securities industry at a remarkable Pounds 3.6bn being the largest single
component. So the figures have more to do with a bubbling stock market than
a booming economy. Moreover, corporate results, such as the recent poor
figures from that one-time wonder J. Sainsbury, continue to fall short of
expectations. And there is no shortage of anecdotal evidence that the
pre-Christmas retail boomlet has more or less petered out.
The British economic recovery has so far appeared to follow the pattern
charted by theUS. But there is one very striking difference in store, which
is that the Aprilfiscal crunch in the UK is infinitely tighter than anything
proposed by the Clinton administration. The risk is that in seeking to
establish his anti-inflationary credentials in an economy that may prove to
be less robust than he thinks, Mr George could find himself presiding over a
mouse of a recovery.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Men in the News: Taking the rough with the smooth - Common
ground and contrasts between the BAe and BMW chiefs / Evans and
Pischetsrieder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dick Evans, a rough and tough Lancastrian, and Bernd Pischetsrieder, a
poised and polished Bavarian, appear to have more cause for mutual
congratulation than they have in common. But that perception may change.
The chief executive of British Aerospace and the chairman of BMW found some
common ground a week ago when they struck the deal which surrendered control
of the UK's Rover Group to Germany. Evans found a safe and rich home for
Rover. Pischetsrieder found an 'almost ideal' add-on partner to expand BMW
outside its high-performance niche. As a result, both saw their reputations
soar. Pischetsrieder was hailed as an entrepreneurial hero while Evans was
lauded for seizing an opportunity of a lifetime.
There, the common ground appears to run out. Evans has been a controversial
figure since he got the BAe job four years ago. Since last May, when
Pischetsrieder inherited the top post - but not the title of 'Mr BMW' - from
Eberhard von Kuenheim, he has received only flattery.
The BAe chief's supporters in the defence industry see him as a hero: a man
who knows the business inside out and who, in the group's darkest hour last
year, sold Pounds 4bn-worth of Tornados to Saudi Arabia.
His detractors see matters differently. They argue that this salesman with
scant experience of general management survived the disastrous Pounds 432m
rights issue two years ago only because he was kingpin in the darkling world
of Saudi Arabian deal-making.
That image is changing. Last Monday's announcement has won him more friends
in the City. 'We are now seeing a slightly different Dick Evans,' says one
observer. 'This week he looks the smart boy.'
Evans, who presented the deal alongside Richard Lapthorne, BAe finance
director, and Rover boss George Simpson, acquitted himself well. There was
no trace of the plain-talker who used to unleash his temper at meetings
intended to massage investor relations.
Communication has never been Evans's strongest suit. One investor comments:
'I have rarely met a powerful chairman or chief executive with so little
sheen or gloss.' He concedes, however, that Evans has grown more comfortable
in the job; smoother and more diplomatic.
The Ministry of Defence view is mixed. Lord Younger, former defence
secretary, has named Evans as the British businessman he most admired,
citing his role in turning round BAe. On the other hand, Alan Clark,
ex-defence minister, describes his most appealing characteristic as being 'a
true Englander. I found this very sympathetic. It allowed me to tolerate
some of his other attributes.'
On a brief encounter it is not easy to get the measure of Evans.
Bespectacled and stout, wearing shirtsleeves, he talks a great deal though
it is hard to know what he is really thinking. One thing is clear. He is a
practical man, dedicated to the job. 'I have a tremendous capacity for hard
work,' he says. This week he has been existing on a diet of claret and
apples.
He starts work most days by 6.30am, rarely getting home before 11.30pm. He
works two weekends out of four, and is hanging on the phone for most of the
others. A routine of 'very little sleep' is punctuated frequently by naps on
long-haul flights.
Evans is not boastful. Indeed, he does not seem happy talking about himself.
He emphasises he is one of a team: a team runs the company, a team clinched
the Saudi deal, a team sold Rover. He is allergic to the cult of
personality, and has no desire to delve into his Blackpool background. He
likes to play golf, usually with customers, but whenever he comes home he is
'brought down to earth by three daughters firing from the hip, reminding you
who's king'.
As for selling aircraft to Saudi Arabia and car companies to Germans, he
puts it all down to flair. 'It's a matter of getting the right chemistry
working. It isn't an art you can develop, but something you either have or
don't have.'
But he is ready to dispute that he is better at selling than managing. He
argues that people say that only because the salesman's achievements are
more apparent. In any case, the ability to sell is paramount. 'We can have
the most efficient organisation on earth. But if we have no business coming
in through the front door, whatever lies behind the door is not worth a row
of beans,' he snorts.
More than a salesman, he sees himself as a strategic thinker. The new-look
BAe, in which cars no longer have a part, is his design, not one brought in
with the new chairman. 'I wanted John (Cahill) to understand that upfront,
he must sign up and take ownership of that strategy - which he did,' he
adds.
Which is what happened - in reverse - at BMW, where the hitherto unknown
Pischetsrieder inherited the strategy of von Kuenheim, retiring after 23
years at the top of BMW. In fact, the 45-year-old is an integral part of a
long-term strategy established by 'the Old Man', as von Kuenheim styled
himself.
The prickly Prussian prepared his succession and his strategy carefully. It
was his plan to extend BMW's product range and market reach. It was his plan
to replace BMW's autocratic leadership - himself - with an Evans-style team.
Pischetsrieder is firmly flanked ('walled-in' as some say) by two
power-sharing colleagues.
On one side sits Horst Teltschik, a former adviser to Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, and now known as BMW's 'foreign minister'. On the other sits Wolfgang
Reitzle, an old college chum of the chairman, who presides over a
'mega-ministry' which gives him effective control over most aspects of
development, purchasing and production and some 7,000 staff.
Nor is von Kuenheim out of the picture. Now chairman of the group
supervisory board, he has taken an office one floor below the management,
from where he massages and maintains crucial links with the rich and
secretive Quandt family, which owns anything up to 75 per cent of the
business.
While such a structure makes it tempting to doubt Pischetsrieder's al-lies'
claims that the Rover coup was all his own work, the speed and calm
efficiency of the move matched his reputation perfectly. As one industry
insider said last year: 'He is a placid man, decisive, hard, fast and
footsure.'
His handling of British unions' angst this week demonstrated successful
application of his belief that 'leadership is to do with communication and
conversation'. As one competitor noted: 'He is probably the most-trusted
manager - at all levels - in the business.'
It was Pischetsrieder, previously production director, who gave BMW a head
start in Germany's current race for improved productivity. A plain speaker
like BAe's Evans, he made no bones about the implications. 'Simultaneous
engineering with our suppliers means nothing more and nothing less than
asking our employees to give up their jobs,' he said.
His directness is not limited to the shop floor. Asked in an interview about
his relationship with von Kuenheim, he was almost blase. He had no problems,
he said, because they both understood the duties of a supervisory board. One
element was supervision, the other was to provide advice - when it was asked
for.
In common with Evans, but for different reasons, he shuns the limelight. In
a community where capitalism's captains are still terrorist targets, he
guards his privacy. He limits his risk-taking to the business arena and
increasingly rare outings on his snowboard.
On the job, while the practical Evans attributes his successes to flair and
'getting the chemistry working', Pischetsrieder, the trained engineer, also
shows himself to be more open in his thinking about management than is
common in Germany. Unfortunately, the processes which led to successful
products were not always logical, he said in an interview last year. They
therefore could not be planned down to the last detail. He was 'almost
frightened' to say so, but gut feelings and chance had to be allowed a role
in management.
Gabriele Hoffmann, one of Germany's leading astrologers, had no such fears
when casting his horoscope around the same time. The Aquarian Pischetsrieder
was a 'super type', she said, with a good instinct for what is important.
'From November BMW will have a possibility to take a share in a foreign
company,' she predicted.
Whether he was following his gut feelings or Hoffmann, Pischetsrieder made
his first unsolicited approach to BAe last October. He and Evans took their
chances last weekend.
The Evans persona, as has been noted, is already becoming smoother and
smarter. Chances are that a spell in the hurly-burly of life beyond BMW's
exclusive niche will roughen and toughen Pischetsrieder sufficiently to earn
him the title 'Mr BMW', which for the moment still belongs to the Old Man.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Counties link up to attract investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five counties in south-west England yesterday launched a partnership to
attract investment to the region.
The West of England Partnership is expected to win seed funding from the
government's Invest in Britain Bureau.
It will represent Avon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister and MP for Bristol West,
said at the launch that the five counties were the only part of the country
outside London and the south-east to lack a regional development
organisation. With the growing importance of regional identity in Europe, it
was an 'extraordinary gap', he said.
The partnership, to be chaired by Sir Michael Lickiss, chairman of Somerset
Economic Partnership, is supported by county and district councils, training
and enterprise councils and existing county-wide economic forums.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Welsh quangos face crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MrJohn Redwood, Welsh secretary, is tightening control of Welsh quangos to
improve their accountability in the wake of a series of scandals.
These culminated this week in a fraud squad investigation of the foreign
expenses claimed by Professor John Catford, who resigned on Wednesday as
director of Health Promotion Wales. Prof Catford denies any misuse of public
funds.
Mr Redwood said yesterday that he was 'very upset' by the scandals. He
added: 'The people of Wales expect us to show we have been honest in
exposing what has gone on and have taken the right action to deal with it.
That's what I intend to do.'
The biggest spending agencies, such as the Welsh Development Agency, will
now have annual meetings with Mr Redwood to review performance and set
targets. Other big agencies, such as the Development Board for Rural Wales,
will report to Sir Wyn Roberts, Welsh minister.
Both the WDA and DBRW have been heavily criticised by the National Audit
Office and the Commons public accounts committee.
Other executive agencies will report to Mr Gwilym Jones, parliamentary
under-secretary.
Mr Redwood said the review meetings would provide 'a sharper focus' to
agency policy requirements and targets. 'I've asked officials to work up the
kind of targets and requirements we intend to impose on each body andI've
started talking to the major bodies about it,' he said.
Mr Michael Scholar, Welsh Office permanent secretary, will take
responsibility for ensuring that chief executives are following agreed
procedures.
Mr Redwood said he intended to set a climate in which people understood that
compliance with regulations and probity came first. 'They also have to
understand that, if a mistake is made or something worse happens,
appropriate action will be taken.'
Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, yesterday called on Mr
Redwood to resign. 'He has been unable to curb the excesses of quangos in
Wales,' Mr Davies said.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Sales of new homes continue to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, MAGGIE URRY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in sales of new houses which began last year is being
sustained, confidential figures from housebuilders indicate.
Sales of new houses increased during January, according to figures compiled
from 27 housebuilders.
The statistics, collected by the House Builders Federation, show net
reservations - agreed sales on which a 10 per cent deposit has been paid,
less cancellations - rose by 4 1/2 per cent compared with the first four
weeks of 1993.
The increase in the number of visitors to housing development sites was even
more encouraging - more than 9 per cent over up on the same period last
year.
The rises indicate that the recovery in sales of new houses has been
sustained in spite of concern about the impact of forthcoming tax increases
on buyers' confidence.
Mr Dennis Webb, managing director of Beazer Homes, Britain's fourth-largest
housebuilder, said: 'We have had a very good start to the yearin terms of
agreed sales and visitors. More importantly, the recovery is being
maintained.'
Mr Webb said that since October Beazer's net reservations had risen by 30
per cent compared with the same period a year earlier. 'Even if you discount
the fact that we are selling from more sites, the underlying increase is
about 20 per cent,' he added.
The 27 companies, mostly large national and regional organisations, build
about 40 per cent of new homes, which account for about a tenth of all house
transactions. Sales of new houses are estimated by builders to have risen by
15 per cent to 20 per cent last year compared with an increase of about 5
per cent for all homes.
The figures come against a background of mixed signals from other sources
about the future of the housing market.
Gross and net mortgage lending rose slightly in December compared with
November, according to figures released yesterday by the Bank of England.
The figures cover banks, building societies and centralised lenders.
The seasonally adjusted results suggested that societies had regained some
marketshare from the banks after months of tough competition.
During the fourth quarter of last year, societies had net lending of Pounds
2.8bn, while banks' net lending amounted to Pounds 2.6bn. In the third
quarter, banks had lent more than societies, with figures of Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 2.3bn respectively.
Overall, net lending stood at Pounds 1.8bn in December, against Pounds 1.7bn
the previous month, while gross lending increased to Pounds 4.8bn. But
mortgage loan approvals - a forward-looking indicator of the state of the
market - fell in number and volume on both raw figures and seasonally
adjusted data.
A further note of caution came from research carried out for Roof Briefing,
the housing magazine. This suggested that prospects of a national housing
market recovery would falter because markets in areas such as London and the
south-east would remain 'in the doldrums' for thenext 18 months.
First Europe, a consultancy firm specialising in the property sector, drew
on six sets of market factors in reaching its conclusion thatonly parts of
the Yorkshire region, the north-east and Wales were likely to pick up
significantly.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Carmakers surprised by 20% jump in registrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Registrations of new cars in Britain jumped by 20 per centyear-on-year in
January as the recovery in demand grew ahead of industry forecasts.
Registrations totalled 198,525 compared with 164,939 in the samemonth a year
ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders.
Sales last month were the highest for January since 1990 but were still
below the record level of 220,000 reached in January 1989.
Sales of new cars rose 11.6 per cent last year to 1.78m, ending three years
of recession. Most industry forecasts suggest a further rise of between 5
per cent and 6 per cent in the whole of 1994.
Demand remains weak in the commercial vehicle sector, where registrations in
January rose year-on-year by only 1.3 per cent to 17,642, chiefly under the
impact of depressed light-van sales.
Sales of commercial vehicles fell overall last year by 2.1 per centto
197,067, the fourth successive annual decline, although a significant
recovery is under way in the truck sector.
In the car market, Ford and Vauxhall, the market leaders, both started the
year strongly, and Citroen, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz also outperformed the
market.
The planned takeover of Rover by BMW will push the German carmaker into
third place in the UK car market. In January the combined forces of the two
groups captured 15 per cent of UK new-car sales compared with 16 per cent a
year earlier.
Citroen achieved its highest monthly share yet with 6.6 per cent. As a
single marque it moved into fourth place in the UK market for the first time
behind Ford, Vauxhall and Rover but ahead of Peugeot, traditionally the
dominant make in the PSA Peugeot Citroen groupof France.
The fortunes of Mercedes-Benz of Germany have been boosted bythe launch in
the second half of last year of its C-class executive car. Its total sales
were 48 per cent higher than in the same month a year previously.
Several Japanese carmakers, notably Toyota, Mitsubishi and Mazda, lost
groundheavily last month, and all suffered steep declines in sales volumes
in spite of the strong growth in the overall market.
Vauxhall, General Motors' UK subsidiary, is putting up most of its car and
light commercial vehicle prices frommidnight tomorrow by an average of 2.3
per cent.
The prices of its Cavalier and Carlton models are being held until March 6
in order 'to allow company car drivers to minimise their tax liability'.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Consumer group in window deals row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consumer group linked to two men facing directors' disqualification
proceedings has become embroiled in acontroversy over a collapsed window
installation company.
Guardian Windows, a Hampshire-based company, went into liquidation this week
owing an estimated Pounds 6m to 6,000 creditors.
Mr Ivor Gershfield - general manager of the consumer group The Householders
Association - and his son Aaron, who was a director of THA, are facing court
action on Monday following the launch of disqualification proceedings by the
Department of Trade and Industry in December.
The DTI action arises from the Gershfields' involvement with City &amp;
Westminster, the finance house which collapsed in 1991. The action is taken
under Section 6 of the Directors Disqualification Act, which penalises
directors for unfit conduct or serving on the boards of insolvent companies.
THA had provided bonded guarantees to thousands of customers of Guardian
Windows, which ran an unusual promotional scheme to increase sales.
More than 1,300 angry creditors attended a meeting this week, called by
insolvency firm Fanshawe Lofts. They attacked THA for accepting
subscriptions to its bonded guarantee scheme when the plan did not cover
promotional contracts.
Guardian customers signed promotional contracts which provided a number of
windows for a deposit of Pounds 1,299. The company waived payments after the
deposit for the purchase of windows up to Pounds 4,000.
If the customer introduced a second contract to Guardian - an average-sized
house needed at least two contracts to replace all the windows - thedeposit
would be refunded.
Guardian collapsed with at least 1,500 contracts outstanding. THA has
offered to install the windows for the difference between Pounds 1,299 and
Pounds 4,000, even though that would not have originally been paid. The
deposits are not covered under the scheme after three months.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Labour attacks Tory 'sleaze'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday launched its campaign for the European and local elections
with an attack on 'Tory sleaze'.
Launching the campaign at a local government conference in Glasgow, Mrs
Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, said the elections would be a
nationwide referendum on the government, which was 'disintegrating in a
spectacle of frenzied infighting'.
Activists were warned that the Tories would 'fight dirty' in the elections,
which take place in May and June.
Government strategists fear that Labour's lead of nearly 20 points in the
latest opinion polls points to a massive loss of support in both elections.
However, officials on both sides are warning that the number of seats that
change hands may be small because of the poor Tory performance in the last
round of elections.
Mr Jack Straw, manager of Labour's local elections campaign, yesterday made
clear that the party would focus on the Conservatives' fitness to govern.
'This is a government which is finding it almost impossible to distinguish
between private and party gain on the one hand, and the public interest on
the other,' he said.
Government ministers will this weekend reinforce Mr John Major's rallying
call for unity, made to backbench Tories on Thursday night. They will also
issue a co-ordinated attack on Labour's European policy.
However, one rightwing MP made it clear that his wing of the party would
continue to speak out on issues that concerned it. Mr Edward Leigh, MP for
Gainsborough and Horncastle, said: 'If we believe we are spending too much
or taxing too much or appeasing the IRA too much, we are entitled to say
these things.'
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, last night told Conservatives in Crewe
that a lack of discipline was the reason the party was not getting broad
public support.
'It is time to forget about factions . . . it's time to turn our fire on to
the Labour party whose policies could so damage the country,' he said.
Mr Howard is expected to offer Mr Major emphatic support when he addresses
the Young Conservative conference in Southport today. Mr Norman Fowler, the
party chairman, who will also address the conference, is expected to do the
same.
An opinion poll today in The Herald, the Glasgow newspaper, shows Labour
support in Scotland unchanged from last month at 47 per cent. The Scottish
National party is on 22 per cent (1 point down); the Tories are on 16 per
cent (1 point up); and Liberal Democrats unchanged at 14 per cent.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Customs chokes on liquid definition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Value Added Tax Tribunal has made the first legal definition of a
beverage in blocking an attempt by HM Customs &amp; Excise to claim VAT on a
dietary product.
Customs conceded in a statement issued yesterday that the meaning of a
beverage in ordinary usage covers 'drinks or liquors that are commonly
consumed'.
The announcement followed a decision by the tribunal that 'liquids that are
commonly consumed are those that are characteristically taken to increase
bodily liquid levels, to slake the thirst, to fortify or give pleasure'.
The case was triggered by an appeal by Bioconcepts, a company based in
Havant, which manufactures Bio-Light, an opaque brown fluid designed
primarily for slimmers.
Customs zero-rated the product when the company began importing it in 1990,
then changed its mind. It caved in when Bioconcepts appealed, then again
made a VAT demand which the company said would have cost it more than Pounds
100,000.
Customs argued that Bio-Light was a manufactured beverage, which would make
it liable for VAT at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent, rather than the
zero rate applied to foods.
Bioconcepts took its case to the VAT tribunal, stressing that Bio-Light was
a liquid food and adding that it was rated as such in other European
countries.
The tribunal found in favour of Bioconcepts, arguing that Bio-Light would
not be consumed for pleasure.
Customs said the growing number of health- and sports-related products which
could be taken as a drink with food were making it increasingly difficult to
assess their liability for tax.
It said it had also lost a previous case, in which the tribunal found that a
liquid sold for body-builders was also a food.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Lloyd's could snatch victory in Names vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's could still win majority acceptance from lossmaking Names for its
Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer, the Association of Lloyd's
Members said yesterday.
The association, which represents about half of the market's 18,000 Names -
individuals whose assets back the market - said informal polls of its
members had shown a two-to-one majority in favour of the offer.
Mr Neil Shaw, association chairman, said: 'Names should not assume from
press reports that the offer is boundto fail. If Names wish to accept
Lloyd's offer, it is vital for them to act to protect their own interests.'
Recent meetings of action groups have indicated that many of the heaviest
lossmaking Names intend to reject the deal and that Lloyd's would not get
the 70 per cent majority - by value of the offer - needed for its
acceptance.
Mr Shaw said: 'There is a significant number of Names for whom acceptance of
the offer would not be appropriate, but also there is an equally significant
number for whom acceptance would be in their best interest.'
He said it was not necessary for Names to resign from their action groups if
they accepted the offer. If the offer failed, Names' acceptanceswould be
void and they would be free to pursue their litigation rights.
The statement drew an angry response from Mr Michael Deeny, chairmanof the
Gooda Walker Names Action group - the biggest of more than a dozen action
groups - whose case is due to come to court in April. He said: 'The truth
is, the offer is dead. Every single action group actively engaged in
litigation has voted to reject the offer by an overwhelming majority.'
Lloyd's will announce the number of acceptances for the offer on February
14.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance package rescues Scots pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monkt onhall Mineworkers, the consortium operating a deep mine leased from
British Coal, has been rescued by Waverley Mining Finance, a quoted mining
finance house. Waverley has organised a financial restructuring involving
funds worth Pounds 7m.
The package should enable the mine to become profitable, and will allow a
second face to be opened at the Monktonhall pit, which is near Edinburgh.
The minehas had financial difficulties since it began production under the
miners' consortium in early 1993, after being closed by British Coal in
1987.
Thefinance house is understood to be taking 49 per cent of Monktonhall
Mineworkersby injecting about Pounds 300,000 of new equity and providing
about Pounds 1m in loans.
Waverley, on behalf of Monktonhall, has negotiated a subsidy of Pounds 1.8m
from the Department of Trade and Industry, while Lothian region is to
provide a grant of Pounds 230,000.
Bank of Scotland is believed to be writing off a substantial part of the
company's Pounds 1.8m debt and making available Pounds 400,000 of leasing
finance through its subsidiary Kellock. Trade creditors have agreed to the
restructuring.
Mr Willie McLucas, investment manager of Waverley, said the funding would
meet the need for Pounds 2m of equipment, Pounds 3m of short-term debt,
Pounds 1m to fund losses before the new production from the second face and
Pounds 1m of working capital.
The deal is to be formally approved by shareholders next week. In November
the miners rejected a bid for 100 per cent of the company fromRJB Mining, in
spite of the likelihood of bankruptcy without a rescue.
Mr McLucas is thought to have established a rapport with the miners which
should allow the deal to go ahead. He said: 'The mood of optimism and the
confidence that together we have created an exciting enterprise is most
encouraging.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / Build-up of allegations behind the Malaysian dam: The Pounds
234m Pergau aid project may have some disturbing parallels with the
arms-for-Iraq affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'Great Britain plc has come out of all this very well,' Lord Younger, the
former defence minister, said this week. He was commenting on the
controversial events which led to a Pounds 1bn arms deal between the UK and
Malaysia in the late 1980s.
British companies may have benefited, but allegations about the deal are
troubling the government. Two Commons committees are investigating whether
the arms package was secured as a direct consequence of the promise of
substantial aid to Malaysia.
In October a National Audit Office report criticised the government's
commitment to provide Pounds 234m to a Malaysian hydro-electric dam project
 -the most ever provided for a single scheme under the Overseas Development
Administration's Aid and Trade Provision.
In a parallel with the arms-for-Iraq affair, the question is whether the
government breached its own guidelines or the law in securing the arms deal
in 1988.
Another allegation has emerged in the past week that the government
suppressed evidence in a criminal case against a Malaysian banker to prevent
embarrassment to the Malaysian government.
This case also echoes the arms-for-Iraq affair. It involves Mr Lorrain
Osman, former head of the Hong Kong operations of Bank Bumiputra, the
Malaysian state-owned bank. In a 1990 High Court appeal by Mr Osman against
moves to extradite him to Hong Kong, the Foreign Office applied for public
interest immunity certificates to prevent disclosure of government documents
in thecase.
This was the first time the government had used such certificates to prevent
disclosure of information in a criminal case. It was the direct precedent
for its failed attempt to use them to prevent disclosure of ministers'
knowledge of arms sales to Iraq in the Matrix Churchill case in 1992.
In the Osman case the certificates were allegedly used to withhold evidence
of a supposed cover-up of the involvement of senior Malaysian politicians,
including Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, in lending by the bank to
the failed Carrian Corporation. The allegations were made under
parliamentary privilege by Mr Robert Parry, Labour MP for Liverpool
Riverside.
The Foreign Office is still refusing to disclose the contents of the
documents withheld. If they say what Mr Parry alleges, they would have been
unwelcome news for Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, who had
developed a close relationship with Dr Mahathir.
In 1989 she said: 'I hope that I am not presuming in describing him as a
friend, whose counsel I have found invaluable, as well as a very skilful and
tough negotiator for Malaysia's interests.'
They took the leadingroles in the negotiations on the Pounds 1bn arms deal.
Lady Thatcher, ever the champion of the UK defence industry, wanted to
persuade Dr Mahathir to end his 'Buy British Last' trade policy, introduced
at the beginning of the decade as a reprisal against withdrawal of
concessions on fees paid by Malaysian students in British universities.
She succeeded in March 1988 when a protocol for a substantial defence
contract was agreed. According to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
this contained a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects under
this programme'.
Lord Younger, who signed the protocol, said this week that the aid reference
was included in error. He had not noticed the reference at the time.
The Foreign Office, which was 'totally clear all along that there could be
no link', pointed out the mistake to him soon afterwards. Lord Younger wrote
to the Malaysian government saying there could be no link between arms and
aid.
Negotiations were continued by Lady Thatcher personally when she went to
Kuala Lumpur in September 1988. In a meeting with Dr Mahathir from which all
officials were excluded, a memorandum of understanding on Pounds 1bnof
British arms sales was agreed.
The following month, the development administration received a strong
recommendation from the Department of Trade andIndustry that Malaysia's
Pergau dam scheme should be regarded as a strong candidate for Aid and Trade
Provision cash support. The DTI has a formal role in recommending schemes
for such support, but the final decision is supposed to be taken by the
Overseas Development Administration.
The Pergau scheme was expensive and rapidly became more costly. A contract
estimate of Pounds 316m in January 1989 by Trafalgar House and BICC, the UK
companies which would build the dam, roseto Pounds 397m on March 31.
At about this time, Dr Mahathir was visiting London. Lord Younger met him in
his hotel room, but he said there was no discussion of aid.
In April 1989, the UK government made a formal aid grant offer toMalaysia.
The final offer was not made or accepted by the Malaysians until 1991, when
the cost of the scheme had reached Pounds 417m, including a British
contribution of Pounds 234m.
The magnitude of the British subsidy was unusual. There wasalso a breach of
normal Whitehall procedures in that the offer was made againstthe advice of
Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the administration, and
of Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, who regarded the
scheme as uneconomic and a bad use of scarce resources.
Businessmen and officials admit privately that there was an informal link
between the offer ofaid to Malaysia and the winning of civil and military
contracts for British companies. One businessman closely involved in
UK-Malaysian trade relations said: 'You and I know that there is a
connection between winning arms sales in Malaysia and offers of aid - but
the question is whether anyone was stupid enough to leave explicit
evidence.'
In ethical terms, that link might be wrong, 'but you don't win contracts
against competition from the French and the Americansif you take ethics too
seriously'.
The British government is not discussing the affair in terms of ethics, but
in terms of the law. Ministers and Whitehall officials insist there is no
legislation banning ministers from offering aid in return for defence
business.
The central piece of foreign aid legislation, the 1980 Overseas Development
and Co-operation Act, does not cover the subject of military assistance.
But if there was no breach of the law, there may have been a contravention
of official Aid and Trade Provision guidelines,described by one official as
the administration's 'bible'. Its commandments include: 'The aid programme
may not be used to procure equipment of a military nature or for a military
use.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / Tarmac aims to dig deep in Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large chunk of the rocky Norwegian coastline could shortly be finding its
way into British motorways, hospitals, offices and homes.
Tarmac, the UK contractor and building materials group, has acquired the
right to buy and develop one of Europe's biggest quarries at Jossingfjord,
which is 70 miles south of Stavanger.
Yesterday the company announced that it had received a NKr10m (Pounds 1m)
grant from the Norwegian Development Bank to help to pay for geological
studies and the preparation of detailed plans. Up to 40 per cent of the
high-grade igneous anorthosite could be exported to the UK by the late 1990s
for use in construction projects.
The quarry scheme, including a deep-water harbour in thenearby fjord, is
expected to cost up to NKr750m. Tarmac has agreed to hide the quarry by
scooping out the inside of the hill, leaving its sides intact.
The anorthosite will be crushed and transported on conveyor belts along a
1,000-yard tunnel through the wall of the hill to the dock, which will be
capable of handling ships of up to 70,000 tonnes.
Mr Peter Rothwell, commercial director of Tarmac Quarry Products, said:
'This is a very beautiful coastline and wewant to do nothing to spoil it.
'These are the most comprehensive environmental protection safeguards we
have had to meet.'
Tarmac has preliminary planning permission for the development, which it
initially expects to produce about 5m tonnes a year.
The company produces about 40m tonnes of aggregate annually in the UK out of
a total British output of 230m tonnes.
The plan to develop a Norwegian quarry comes as the UK government is
considering restricting planning permission for quarrying to protect the
environment.
A consultation paper published by the Department of the Environment last
year proposed that local authorities base future planning permission on
providing 80 per cent of demand from local quarries, with the shortfall made
up from imports and recycling.
Yet ministers are concerned that the new planning guidelines, which are due
to be published shortly, should not impede recovery in the construction
market.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Terrorist broadcasting ban to be maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The restrictions on broad-casting in the UK the voices of terrorists or
their supporters in Northern Ireland are to remain in place in spite of
reservations in the Northern Ireland Office.
The government said yesterday that the National Heritage Department had
decided to continue with the ban, which came into force in October 1988.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is the only legal political
organisation affected by the ban.
Whitehall officials said the Northern Ireland Office had questioned the
effectiveness of a ban which allows actors to speak the words of Sinn Fein
representatives over pictures of them speaking.
Lifting the restriction would have caused an outcry from Ulster unionists
and rightwing Conservatives. TheThatcherite Conservative Way Forward
yesterday launched its policy for Ulster calling for preventive detention
north and south of the border with an appeal system.
The group said: 'The worst thing now would be for policy in Northern Ireland
to drift on aimlessly in the forlorn hope that the terrorists will change
their minds.'
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, renewed his appeal to Sinn
Fein to join the other political parties in talks which could involve a
significant transfer of power to Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick repeated the British view that the UK-Irish joint declaration,
which was intended to stand the test of time, could not be renegotiated as,
he said, was now the intention of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.
He said: 'That was the message we sent to them last year. It is repeated
unequivocally in the joint declaration. The governments have set out where
they stand. The challenge is for Sinn Fein - themselves alone.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / Coal closures will cut workforce to 10,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal will employ fewer than 10,000 miners by the end of April after
yesterdayconfirming the closure of four pits.
The 10,000 figure represents a 75 per cent cut from the 40,000 employed 15
months ago. The latest figure compares with more than 200,000 a decade ago
and 1.1m at the industry's height in 1913.
The scale of the contraction is most marked in the north-east of England
which, British Coal confirmed yesterday, is to lose its last deep mine, at
Ellington in Northumberland.
Just before the first world war Northumberland and Durham had 224,000 miners
in at least 300 mines. After Ellington closes in the next two weeks, the
only coal digging will be done by 1,300 workers employed in opencast
operations, most of them for contractors to British Coal.
Yesterday's closure announcements at Ellington and at Ollerton, Manton and
Annesley, inNottinghamshire, will lead to about 3,000 miners losing their
jobs.
Earli er this week the loss of another 400 jobs was announced with the
planned closure of Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire. There will also be
considerable casualties among the 770 employed at Maltby and Silverwood, in
South Yorkshire, which are to merge.
At the start of this week British Coal employed 14,030 people at 22mines as
well as 6,540 non-industrial staff and 2,940 others. This will fall byat
least 3,700 as a result of this week's closures and mergers, and there will
be a significant number of voluntary redundancies at the 17 remaining
working pits by the end of April.
An enhanced redundancy package, which provides for payments of up to Pounds
37,000, is on offer until the end of April. Although it may subsequently be
renewed, the uncertainty will encourage miners even at pits with relatively
secure futures to take up the terms on offer.
Silve rwood is likely to survive longer, but it is the junior partner in the
merger with Maltby. Silverwood will in effect be closed and although Maltby
is not producing coal in large quantities it is likely to do so after the
merger.
Five pits identified for closure in October 1992 are still open. They are
Kiveton, Maltby and Prince of Wales in the Yorkshire region, Point of Ayr in
north Wales and Bilsthorpe in Nottinghamshire.
Cory Coal, a marketing, preparation anddistribution company, part of
Germany's Veba energy group, has joined a consortium formed by the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers and Jim Walter Resources, a USmining concern, to bid
for assets of British Coal.

Luton Airport yesterday took to the European Commission its complaint that
BAA, the airports operator, was pursuing anti-competitive pricing policies
at Stansted Airport, its rival London airport, Rachel Johnson writes.
The airport, owned by Luton Borough Council, said: 'As a result of
Stansted's pricing policy Luton has suffered and continues to suffer
material harm.' BAA owns all airports in the London area apart from Luton,
and handles 97 per cent of all passengers. Luton says Stansted's charges to
airlines and tour operators are substantially lower than its own.
BAA countered that the Civil Aviation Authority had already declined to take
action after holding an inquiry into the complaint, even though it agreed
that Stansted's pricing policywas below cost.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Safety fears halt cancer research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government inspectors have acted for the first time to stop genetic
engineering research for safety reasons.
The Health and Safety Executive has served 'prohibition' and 'improvement'
notices on Birmingham University's Department of Cancer Studies where
researchers were using viruses to carry cancer-causing genes - known as
oncogenes - into human cell cultures.
The inspectors told them to stop work because they had not done enough to
contain the genetically engineered virus in the laboratory. There was
theoretically a remote risk that it could escape and infect lab workers or
the public.
In the words of the prohibition notice, 'sufficient assessments of the risks
of this work to human health and the environment have not been carried out,
so causing uncertainty as to whether the correct level of containment has
been adopted'.
Professor David Westbury, vice-principal of Birmingham University, said the
project - part of a large programme funded by the Cancer Research Campaign -
was suspended as soon as the notices were issued. 'Some initial work had
started but it was only for a couple of weeks,' Prof Westbury said.
The cancer researchers are now working out tighter containment precautions
in consultation with the university's safety staff and HSE inspectors. For
example it is planned that the viral oncogene project will have its own
secure room instead of sharing space with other cancer research.
By an unfortunate coincidence, Birmingham University was the site of the
world's last smallpox case - in 1978 - when smallpox virus escaped from a
different laboratory and killed a research worker.
Prof Westbury stressed that there was no link between that incident and the
inspectors' action. 'Circumstances were entirely different then,' he said.

FT  05 FEB 94 / American products jostle for market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within hours of President Clinton's decision to end the Vietnam trade
embargo the first American company had arrived yesterday to grab a slice of
the action.
By the end of the day, Pepsico, the US soft drinks maker, not only had
bottles of Pepsi-Cola rolling off a production line in Ho Chi Minh City, but
was preparing to advertise its product on television this weekend with a
commercial starring Miss Vietnam.
Pepsi, which had signed an agreement with a local bottler last year in
anticipation of the embargo ending, seemed to have stolen a march on its
rival, Coca-Cola. But Coke said it would not be far behind. 'Local
production will begin as soon as concentrate and other necessary materials
can be brought into the country.'
Another famous US brand, American Express, will also soon appear. This week
the US charge card company tookthe first step towards creating a network of
hotels, retailers and others who will accept the card as it signed up the
state-owned Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam to act as its paying agent in
the country.
Meanwhile United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, said it would begin
scheduled air services between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City as soon as
it had received government approvals. Northwest Airlines said it was seeking
to start services between Detroit and Ho Chi Minh City.
In fact, American brands are already ubiquitous in Vietnam. Products from
Coca-Cola to IBM get round import restrictions if they have been bottled or
assembled somewhere other than the US.
US companies have been permitted to set up offices in Vietnam and sign
contracts with Vietnamese parties since December 1992, when President Bush
partially eased the embargo. That has allowed US companies to make extensive
preparations for trade.
General Electric, for example, set up an office in Vietnam last year. It
said it saw about Dollars 2bn of opportunities in the next decade for GE
equipment such as medical equipment, locomotives and power plant.
Otis, the elevator company owned by United Technologies, which ceased
operations in Vietnam in 1975, said more than 200 of its lifts were still in
the Ho Chi Minh city area and it began negotiating joint venture deals to
return to the country last year.
Hanoi is reserving its warmest welcome for US companies selling the new
technology it badly needs.
American business consultants in Hanoi say Boeing is expectedto bid soon for
a contract to supply Vietnam Airlines with new medium- and long-range jets.
A delegation from General Electric was in Vietnam last week discussing a big
power plant and other projects. Other sectors of particular interest to the
government are computers and telecommunications, as well as the oil and gas
industry from which Hanoi hopes to increase its revenues, partly with the
helpof American technology.

   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday ended his special
mission in Tokyo, leaving with a promise by the Japanese government to
redouble efforts to resolve the deadlocked trade negotiations.
In a statement issued on his departure from Tokyo, Mr Kantor predicted that
the negotiations on ways of increasing foreign access to Japan's markets
would be successfully concluded on February 11, during a summit between Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, and President Bill Clinton.
Summing up the fruits of his visit, Mr Kantor said the prime minister, Mr
Hosokawa, who met Mr Kantor on Thursday, has directed the government to
redouble its efforts on the talks and that Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign
minister, would lead the negotiations.
Mr Kantor said Japan would send a high level delegation to Washington on
Monday to continue trade talks, including the negotiation of 'objective
criteria' to measure import penetration of specific sectors.
Numerous US-Japanese trade agreements have failed to reduce the massive
Japanese trade surplus, which last year hit about Dollars 59bn (Pounds
39.3bn) with the US. This time Washington is insisting that agreements
include 'benchmarks' to evaluate progress in achieving openings in
insurance, cars and car parts, and government procurement of
telecommunications and medical equipment.
Mr Kantor is also demanding that Japan eliminate all tariffs on copper, wood
and white spirits.
US officials in Washington have been pessimistic about the talks. Mr Jeffrey
Garten, the US commerce undersecretary, Thursday said the two sides 'do not
seem to have even a common understanding of the problem, let alone consensus
on the solutions'.
However, Mr Kantor said Tokyo had agreed to negotiate 'qualitative and
quantitative' criteria to measure the progress of sectoral agreements in
opening markets.

FT  05 FEB 94 / US employment growth slowed by bad weather: Radical change
to monthly survey's method

<TEXT>
Bad weather reduced employment growth in the US last month to about a third
of its recent levels, with only 62,000 jobs created against 190,000 in
December, according to the Labour Department. However the unemployment rate
rose nominally, because of the introduction of new survey methods.
Most hard hit were weather-sensitive industries - with construction, in the
throes of a big expansion, adding only 3,000 jobs. The retail trade
generally, tourism and restaurants also suffered as Americans were forced to
stay at home.
The survey was taken in the week before the California earthquake and the
vast ice and snow storms covering the eastern half of the country.
Substantial rebounds are expected this month, weather permitting.
Manufacturing employment, up only 2,000 in December, rose by 26,000 in
January, while the number of hours worked in factories remained high. Other
recent economic indices have all pointed to continued strong economic
growth, even if not to the point of the 5.9 per cent annual rise in gross
national product achieved in the final quarter of last year.
The unemployment figures for January reflect the most radical revision in
the monthly survey's methodology in its 50-year history. Focused on
full-time employment, the old method under counted part-time workers, many
of them women, but exaggerated 'discouraged' workers, those who have given
up looking for employment.
The new data collection is also based on the the 1990 national census,
reflecting the large growth in the population of minorities with
higher-than-average jobless rates, particularly Hispanics.
The result is that unemployment in January is now estimated at 6.7 per cent,
down from 7 per cent in December, using the new method of calculation. Under
the old method, December's rate was 6.4 per cent and January's would have
been 6.3 per cent.
The department's broad conclusion is that last year's unemployment numbers
would have been roughly 0.5 per cent a month higher had the new methodology
been applied.

<TEXT>
Public prosecutors yesterday raided the home and offices of Mr Tadao Otani,
a diet member belonging to the Japan Renewal party, the second largest
grouping in the government coalition.
The raids represent an important development in the continuing drive against
political corruption. Until now investigators have focused on local
politicians and the business community. If Mr Otani is indicted, he would be
the first diet member to be implicated during the current anti-corruption
effort.
Separately, 23 private individuals filed a complaint with the public
prosecutors against Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Japan Renewal party.
They accused him of receiving illegal donations from construction companies
worth Y5m (Pounds 30,000).
In November, Mr Ozawa admitted receiving millions of yen from a top
construction company, but insisted the donations were not illegal.
Mr Otani's former chief secretary, Mr Susumu Ochiai, has already been
charged for facilitating tax evasion. In January he admitted offering
supporters receipts for political donations in excess of the amounts given.
Under present electoral rules, individuals can receive tax breaks on
donations of more than Y10,000 to political groups, and the 62 supporters
were able to claim inflated amounts, worth Y52.5m.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Hanoi polite but cool over lifting of embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government in Hanoi welcomed the lifting of the embargo in a polite but
unenthusiastic statement. Vietnamese officials had come to view the embargo
as unfair punishment for winning the Vietnam war and they believe they have
waited far too long for the punishment to end.
The deputy foreign minister, Le Mai, attacked the embargo as an abuse of
power by the US and contrary to international law.
Hanoi wants to see normal relations with the US but many obstacles remain.
Financial compensation, the fate of missing American servicemen and
Vietnam's human rights record are among issues to be tackled.
Talks are due to start in Hanoi on February 15 to settle claims by
governments and individuals in both countries for property seized after the
end of the war. The claims are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and
include assets of the former South Vietnamese government which have been
frozen in the US.
Full diplomatic relations between the two countries could still be a year or
more away.
Meanwhile, Hanoi is left wondering what it gains from the lifting of the
embargo. Although American companies will now be able to sell their products
in Vietnam, Vietnamese exports to the US will not be able to compete with
neighbouring countries whose products attract low tariffs under their Most
Favoured Nation trading status.
For now, though, people all over Vietnam are celebrating; not because
President Clinton has finally lifted the embargo but because next week is
the Vietnamese New Year, and the anniversary of the Tet offensive 26 years
ago, the turning point of the war.
Vietnamese people hope this year will be another turning point, away from
memories of war and towards a more prosperous future.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Gatt report praises Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's programme of economic and trade reform yesterday won praise from
trading partners as a model for others to follow.
A Gatt secretariat report on the country's trade policies and practices,
says Australia has pressed ahead with far-reaching reforms despite recession
and big balance of payments deficits.
Noting that Australia took a leading role in the Uruguay Round of global
trade talks, through chairmanship of the Cairns Group of 14 farm exporting
nations, the report nevertheless points out that the drive for reform has
been essentially autonomous as the government has tried to correct the
distorting effects of years of trade protection.
Tariffs have come down and and further reductions are planned, subsidies are
being cut, and previously shielded areas of goods and services are being
progressively opened to competition through deregulation and privatisation.
However, Gatt chides Australia for very high tariffs on some items such as
cars (up to 30 per cent) and textiles, clothing and footwear (up to 47 per
cent), and for higher tariffs on processed goods. Other criticisms concern
Australia's frequent use of anti-dumping actions, which comprised one-third
of all actions notified to Gatt in 1991-92.
Australian officials said tariffs on cars and textiles would be halved by
2000, and noted that the number of anti-dumping cases had fallen in 1993.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Buthelezi wants more concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday said the offer of a
separate regional ballot, made to the right wing Freedom Alliance on
Thursday, would not be enough to draw his Inkatha Freedom party into April's
all-race elections.
'The double ballot by itself is quite meaningless if regions do not have the
autonomy which cannot be interfered with by the constituent assembly,' he
said.
But he left the door open to further talks, saying the ballot compromise
showed further concessions were possible. The ANC had previously insisted it
would never drop its insistence that voters should have only one vote, for
both national and regional assemblies. Faced with the threat of violence
from the right wing, the ANC dropped this insistence.
Thursday's offer to the Freedom Alliance was partly designed to call the
bluff of Chief Buthelezi, who has recently implied the double ballot was the
greatest obstacle to Inkatha participation.
The ANC has demanded the chief commit himself to negotiate flexibly, before
making further offers. The Freedom Alliance, government and ANC are to meet
again Monday.
One Alliance negotiator, Rowan Cronje of the Bophuthatswana homeland,
yesterday suggested negotiations could go beyond Saturday's deadline, the
date by which parties must register for elections. If Alliance parties
register provisionally on Saturday, they could gain a further 20 days for
talks before candidates' nominations are due. But though some parties may
choose this route, it is unlikely Chief Buthelezi will do so.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Japan's ruling parties seek compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's fractious coalition parties will this weekend try to reach a
compromise on controversial tax reform plans after the prime minister Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa agreed yesterday to freeze the proposals.
Mr Hosokawa yesterday apologised for failing to 'ensure sufficient contact'
with his seven coalition partners before announcing a Y6,000bn (Pounds 36bn)
per year tax cut to be financed by a 7 per cent tax on goods and services to
be introduced in 1997. The move provoked the Social Democratic party, the
coalition's largest member, and a strong opponent of a rise in the present 3
per cent sales tax, to threaten to leave the government.
The row has delayed a record Y15,100bn economic stimulus package which Mr
Hosokawa hopes to publish before he meets Mr Bill Clinton, the US president,
in Washington next Friday. Next year's budget, already two months late, and
a supplementary budget for the current year, are also deadlocked by the tax
row.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the government now
hopes to present its economic package - originally due in December - by
Monday or later and a draft budget before the end of the week. 'The schedule
is already very tight, but we must keep that deadline,' he said. There was
'a direction towards some form of compromise,' in the coalition, he said.
Mr Hosokawa had asked cabinet members 'calmly to reconsider'. The proposed
tax cut and counterbalancing sales tax rise is the centrepiece of the
package, which includes government spending and loans.
The prime minister yesterday stuck to his position that the new 'welfare'
tax - to replace the current sales tax - is essential to finance the
proposed income tax cut. He received unusually outspoken support from Mr
Jiro Saito, vice finance minister - the most senior bureaucrat in Japan's
most powerful ministry - who argued that any reduction in the proposed 7 per
cent welfare tax would make income tax cuts impossible.
The row has widened a growing rift between the centre right of the coalition
and the rest. The tax plan has the general support of the Japan Renewal
party, which dominates coalition economic policy, and the Buddhist-backed
Clean Government party, as well as the Finance Ministry and parts of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party. Yet some of Mr Hosokawa's strongest
supporters, in his own Japan New party and in its ally, the New Harbinger
party, share the Socialists' doubts about the style, if not the content, of
the tax proposal.
Despite the seriousness of the row, there were no calls from the cabinet
yesterday for Mr Hosokawa's resignation.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Clinton calls an end to US Vietnam myths: Why post-war
confrontation has been allowed to persist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton's decision to lift the US trade embargo against Vietnam -
announced in the early hours of Friday morning, Vietnam time  - should mark
the end of the long confrontation between Washington and Hanoi which has
been so damaging to both sides.
Vietnamese nationalists have often been baffled by American attitudes to
their country.
Ho Chi Minh, the father of Vietnamese communism whose embalmed body can
still be seen in a mausoleum in Hanoi, so admired American ideals and
American condemnations of colonialism that he called repeatedly on the US
for help in his struggle against the French, particularly after the second
world war.
In declaring independence in Hanoi in 1945 for the brief period before the
French colonisers returned in force, Ho echoed Jefferson in starting with
the words: 'All men are created equal.' He sent numerous appeals for
assistance by letter and telegram to the Truman administration.
There was no reply. The Cold war was beginning, and eventually the US, in
supporting the government of South Vietnam, replaced the French as the main
enemy of Vietnamese communists in the north.
Casualties were disproportionate - hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese dead
compared about 60,000 Americans - but after the war the Vietnamese have been
more willing to forgive the Americans than the Americans are to forgive
them. (The communists reserved most of their bitterness for those of their
fellow-Vietnamese who had sided with the South Vietnamese government; many
were sent to re-education camps.)
The fate of US soldiers missing in action (MiAs) in Vietnam continues to
generate intense interest in the US and further afield, although fewer than
100 are still completely unaccounted for. An estimated 300,000 Vietnamese
are also MiAs, but neither Hanoi nor Washington has ever expressed more than
token concern for Vietnamese people widely assumed, like the Americans, to
be dead.
By the mid-1980s, while the US was still obsessed by the humiliation of its
defeat and reluctant to forgive the Vietnamese communists for winning,
Vietnam's rulers had other problems to deal with.
They were trying to extricate their armed forces from neighbouring Cambodia
(where they had overthrown the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge in 1979) and
confronting a hostile China, while relying on a communist economy that was
evidently a failure.
From 1986, economic reform became the priority. Vietnam started to court the
Americans because Washington was blocking aid from the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Vietnamese co-operation in the hunt for US MiAs improved dramatically, and
President Clinton lifted the veto on multilateral aid in July last year, a
move which was in economic terms much more important than this week's ending
of the unilateral and ineffective US trade embargo.
For reasons of foreign policy, however, the Vietnamese will be delighted to
see a stronger American presence in their country. Washington is regarded as
a useful counterweight to China - a traditional enemy of much greater
historical significance to Vietnam than the US (and closer besides).
Most Vietnamese welcome the end of the embargo, although of course there are
hardline Vietnamese communists who remain as suspicious of the Americans as
hardline American MiA lobbyists remain of the Vietnamese.
No single cause ended the embargo; there was pressure from US companies
which wanted to take advantage of Vietnam's fast-growing economy, and there
was the Vietnamese government's anxiety to please Washington by helping in
the hunt for MiAs; there was also a feeling among some Vietnamese-Americans
that the time for isolating Vietnam was over.
Ms Tiana Thi Thanh Nga, a flamboyant Hollywood actress and karate expert,
recently returned to Vietnam against the advice of her anti-communist
relatives (her father and uncle were ministers in the South Vietnam
government) and created an extraordinarily moving and amusing documentary
which explores the tortured relationship between the US and Vietnam.
'Hollywood,' she said on a recent trip to south-east Asia, 'is perpetuating
the myth of the Gook and the Rambo, and they all buy it.' Perhaps, after Mr
Clinton's announcement, there will be fewer buyers than before.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Pre-paid card ousts New York's subway token
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It is the beginning of the end of an era for the 3.3m passengers who use New
York's subway system each day.
For 40 years, one of the quirks of life in New York City has been the custom
of carrying around a bulging pocket or purse full of the coin-size metal
tokens that people need to buy before they can ride the subway.
The tokens, costing Dollars 1.25 (83p) each and valid for any length of
journey, operate the turnstiles that let passengers through to the trains.
Time-obsessed New Yorkers buy them in bulk to avoid having to queue at the
token booths in the stations each time they want to ride.
Not, however, for much longer. Between now and 1997, the New York Transit
Authority plans to steal a march on the world's other big subway systems by
phasing out the tokens and phasing in the MetroCard, a thin plastic card
which stores the value of pre-paid trips on a magnetic strip.
Passengers will be able to buy the pre-paid cards from token booths in any
denomination up to Dollars 80. Each time they swipe them through a card
reader at the turnstile, the turnstile will open, Dollars 1.25 will be
deducted from the card, and the value remaining will be displayed. When the
card is empty, it can be thrown away or recharged at a booth.
Although similar to systems in other big cities, the MetroCard is
technologically more sophisticated because it allows payments to be deducted
each time a transaction is made instead of allowing unlimited journeys over
a period of time for a fixed cost.
This means it can be extended to a much wider range of uses than other types
of card. In the short term, the New York Transit Authority plans to extend
it to the buses and commuter railways it operates, but it also hopes it will
eventually be used to pay ferry and taxi fares in New York, and tolls on
roads and bridges.
Ultimately, Mr Peter Stangle, the transit authority chairman, wants to bring
in a private sector business partner to develop the MetroCard into an
all-purpose payment card for the region. One day, he believes, people will
use it 'to make phone calls, buy the paper, grab a coffee and a bagel, and
even go get a bite at McDonald's'.
Surprisingly, perhaps, normally sceptical New Yorkers seem ready to welcome
the MetroCard. At Wall Street station in downtown Manhattan, where it came
into operation experimentally last month, an FT straw poll of 12 subway
travellers found none who regretted the passing of the tokens.
Most believed the best argument for the card was that it saved time,
apparently calculating that the swiping movement at the turnstiles took a
fraction of a second less than depositing a token and waiting for it to
tumble through the mechanism.
'I think it's an excellent idea,' said Mr Ross Rosado, a florist's
assistant. 'Quicker is better. This is New York.'

<TEXT>
Greece's Justice Ministryyesterday launched a new investigation into
allegations of corruption during the sale of a state-controlled cement
company to a subsidiary of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group.
The move, coming after a supreme court prosecutor, Mr Athanassios Sioulas,
refused to hand over files on a preliminary inquiry into thesale, signalled
that the Socialist government is preparing for a political confrontation
over the issue.
Mr Sioulas, accused by the government this week of trying to delay the
inquiry, must now surrender all the documents in the case to a criminal
prosecutor appointed yesterday by the justice minister, Mr Giorgos
Kouvelakos.
Several former conservative cabinet ministers could face charges of fraud
and breach of trust as a result of the minister's decision to intervene.
The killing last week of Mr Michalis Vranopoulos, a formergovernor of the
state-controlled National Bank who was the chief Greek negotiator in the
sale of Heracles General Cement, brought the affair back to prominence.
The left-wing Greek terrorist group November 17 said it carried out the
killing, claiming former government members had accepted bribes in the
privatisation of Heracles.
Heracles was sold in 1992 to Cal-Nat, a Greek-Italian joint venture
controlled by Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Ferruzzi, for Dr124bn
(Pounds 330.6m) in the biggest deal carried out under the former
conservative government's privatisation programme.
Ferruzzi officials have claimed that kickbacks were paid to Greek officials
to ensure the sale went through. The Socialist government is considering
whether to renationalise the company byacquiring Calcestruzzi's 52 per cent
share in Cal-Nat, which is being offered for sale.

Germany's week-long engineering sector dispute abated yesterday as trade
union leaders and employersannounced a return to the negotiating table on
Monday.
Gesamtmetall, theengineering workers' employers association, said its
leaders in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia would meet their counterparts
from the IG Metall trade union in Cologne to discuss new compromises for
wage agreements in 1995.
The m eeting will break a week-long deadlock in wage negotiations which has
been marked by protest strikes across the country.
Between 60,000 and 150,000 workers have stopped work for several hours a day
in protest against employers' refusal to grant them a 5.5 per cent pay
increase for 1995. Gesamtmetall is instead offering a cut in real income and
a reduction in holiday pay.
The news of a return to the negotiating table came as figures for December
industrial orders confirmed economists' views that the German economy is
slowly recovering.
West German industrial orders for the month rose by a seasonally-adjusted
1.1 per cent over November. Domestic orders declined by 3.5 per cent,
however, while foreign orders rose by 1.5 per cent, according to the federal
Economics Ministry.
On a two-month basis, favoured by the ministry because itremoves the impact
of seasonal factors, orders in November and December were down 2 per cent
from the previous two months, with orders for capital goods recording the
sharpest drop, at 4 per cent. November and December orders were up by 2 per
cent on the same period in 1992, however, with domestic orders down 2.1 per
cent, but foreign orders up by 10.3 per cent, confirming a pick-up in demand
outside Germany, particularly in the US.

FT  05 FEB 94 / EU plans closer ties with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union aims to wrap up negotiations on a more generous
partnership and co-operation agreement with Ukraine before the March 27
parliamentary elections, a European Commission official said yesterday.
The announcement of closer ties reflects concern in Brussels over the
collapse in Ukraine's economy and a desire to use the prospect of stronger
trade and political ties to curb extreme Ukrainian nationalism in the poll.
At the same time, there was continued confusion over whether Thursday's vote
by the Ukrainian parliament had gone as far as ratifying the Start 1
disarmament treaty, although it was widely acknowledged to have removed
obstacles to ratification.
The UK interpreted the vote as a decision to ratify, which it 'warmly'
welcomed. In Washington, the White House hailed it as 'a major
non-proliferation achievement', and expressed its confidence that Ukraine
would soongo on to agree to the non-proliferation treaty. 'By approving the
Lisbon protocol, Ukraine is committed to accede to the non-proliferation
treaty in the shortest possible time,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White
House press secretary.
During Thursday's debate MPs insisted on more specific details on financial
compensation, security guarantees and dismantlement procedures. Parliament
told the government to finalise these technical agreements with the exchange
of ratification instruments. This leaves a loophole for the Ukrainians on
ratification should the technical agreements not be concluded to
parliament's satisfaction.
Parliament did not ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on Thursday,
but will reconsider it soon.
Meanwhile, EU officials said apartnership pact with the Kiev government
could be signed before a similar agreement with Moscow.
Talks between Russia and the European Commission continued yesterday, but
there were few signs of progress on the two most difficult obstacles, the
treatment of Russian uranium exports and the need to safeguardthe position
of foreign banks operating in Russia.
On Monday, EU foreign ministers will discuss progress on the Ukraine and
Russia partnership agreements at a meeting in Brussels. Ministers are
expected to agree to a mandate for the Commission to negotiate proposed free
trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with Estonia likely to
receive more favourable treatment because it has liberalised its economy
fastest, the Commission said.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Brussels moves to boost fish prices: Balladur announces new
aid measures after fishermen battle police in Rennes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission and the French government yesterday took steps to
prop up the prices of fish and fishermen's revenues, in the wake of a series
of violent protests in France.
After meeting protest leaders in the Breton capital of Rennes, Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur announced his second set of aid measures to
fishermen in two days.
The latest package includes a temporary halving of fishermen's social
security payments and a revenue guarantee thereafter, as well as a doubling
of the money promised on Wednesday to takesurplus fish off the market.
In Brussels, the European Commission reinstated a minimum import price
threshold for seven species of fish, but said the measures would run only
until March 15. Brussels warned that the collapse in white fish prices,
although 'undeniably linked to an import surge at abnormally lowprices', was
nevertheless caused by deeper structural problems such as fallingdemand and
oversupply from within the EU.
Minimum import prices are the reference prices the EU uses to monitor the
market and will apply to cod, haddock, hake, angler-fish, coley, Alaskan
pollack and salmon. The Brussels move is almost identical to measures taken
this time last year, when the Breton fleet lastdramatised the collapse in
the fish market.
'The French market requiresserious analysis, which requires a combination of
solutions going beyond the introduction of these safeguard clauses,' said Mr
Ioannis Paleokrassas, environment and fisheries commissioner, before
emphasising that yesterday's measures weretemporary.
Members of the Dutch parliament demanded that Dutch fishermen should get
similar support from their government and expressed concern thataid to the
French fishermen would otherwise distort competition inside Europe.
In addition to financial aid, Mr Jean Puech, the French agriculture
minister, has set up an inquiry into the efficiency of France's fish
distribution network. Much of the current problem seems to stem from the
fact that fishmongers, the traditional purveyors of Breton-caught fresh fish
to the shops, are being squeezed out by the tendency of the big supermarkets
to buy direct from large foreign suppliers.
Even before imports are taken into account, the EU regimeof quotas intended
to restrict over-fishing creates surges in supply. This is especially true
in February, because quotas are exhausted towards the end of the preceding
year, and bad weather usually keeps fishermen in port during January. Fish
then flood onto the market in February as fleets rush to build up cash-flow.
Cheap imports from Russia, Iceland, Poland and - especially in the case of
salmon - Norway greatly add to market instability, leading in France's case
to government buying in to intervention stocks at well above permitted EU
levels.
Fishermen's leaders expressed some satisfaction at the measures takenby
Brussels and the French government. But Mr Dominique Lapart, head of the
fishermen's 'survival committee' which had organised much of this week's
violent protests in Paris and in Breton and Channel ports, said: 'What we
still most lack is import quotas. The problem of extra-Community imports
still remains.'
Yesterday's clashes in Rennes saw fishermen and riot police throwing
missiles and tear gas at each other and some 23 people reported hurt. Mr
Balladur called for order in the town, saying that 'violence has never made
anything better'.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Dutch contest EU decision on information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch government yesterday decided to start legal action against its
European Union partners in an attempt to overturn their decision to limit
public access to information on EU decisions.
The Dutch decision to take the Council of Ministers of the 12 to the
European Court of Justice comes after a warning on Thursday from Mr Joao de
Deus Pinheiro, European commissioner in charge of the 'openness' policy,
that the Commission would 'go it alone' with a more open system if the
Council restricted public access to information.
The Dutch move will cast an embarrassing spotlight on the much-vaunted open
decision-making policy proclaimed by the last five summits of EU heads of
government, in response to Danish voters' initial rejection of the
Maastricht treaty in June 1992.
The credibility ofthis stance was badly dented in December when the
habitually secretive Council got a discretionary catch-all clause on
confidentiality inserted into the new code of conduct on access to
information, at the behest of Belgium, the UK, Germany and Portugal.
The policy originally prescribed right of access to all EU information,
except where monetary stability, national security, commercial
confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-member countries could be
endangered.
The Council wanted to add to these grounds for refusal provisions 'to
protect the interests of the (EU) institution and safeguard the secrecy of
thedeliberations'.
This was watered down under Dutch and Danish pressure, but the compromise
still gives EU institutions the discretionary right to rejectrequests for
information they consider 'manifestly unreasonable, which is to say a
request that could be contrary to the efficiency and good order of the
institution'.
The Dutch voted against this compromise, while Denmark assented in exchange
for a review after two years. Dutch government officials want thiscode of
conduct annulled, since it was put through by majority vote under Article
151 of the EU treaty, which governs internal regulations. They argue that
thedeclared attempt to enhance the rights of European citizens can not be an
'internal' matter, and should be dealt with under Article 173, which
requires unanimous assent.
'It's politically worthwhile to undo this decision,' Mr Piet Dankert, Dutch
European affairs minister, said yesterday. 'We should do thisespecially
because support for European integration is already in doubt becauseof too
many bureaucratic and secretive structures.'
Mr Pinheiro told journalists on Thursday that, in practice, 'I think it
would be very difficult for the Council to follow a different route from the
Commission' on access to information. But he warned: 'If they introduce some
sort of arbitrary censorship,then we will go it alone.'

Mr Marek Borowski, Poland's finance minister and deputy premier in charge of

Several hours of crisis talks yesterday saw leaders of Mr Borowski's

coalition was established last autumn.
Mr Pawlak has yet to accept the resignation, which comes after he last week
dismissed Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy finance minister, against Mr
Borowski's wishes. That sacking followed a row over the pricing of a bank

FT  05 FEB 94 / Cariplo chairman stands down while under investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roberto Mazzotta has temporarily stepped down from the chairmanship of
Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank, following the issue of an arrest
warrant by Milan magistrates on Monday on charges of alleged corruption.
Arrest warrants were also issued for three other bank officials including Mr
Carlo Polli, the deputy chairman, on similar charges relating to phoney
property transactions by Milan-based Cariplo's rich pension fund. According
to Milan magistrates the transactions carried out between 1985 and 1992
involved more than L5bn (Pounds 2m). Part of this was channelled illicitly
to the Christian Democrats and Socialists, who exercised the main political
influence over Cariplo.
The magistrates are understood to be investigating some 50 property
transactions. Cariplo, which hasthe largest deposit base of any financial
institution in Italy, has assured clients that its financial operations are
not affected and that the investigations affect its independently operated
pension fund.
Mr Mazzotta, a former Christian Democrat minister, is still believed to be
abroad and his temporary resignation was conveyed to the board on Thursday.
This move is in line with Bank ofItaly directives issued last year requiring
executives to step aside pending judicial enquiries.
Mr Mazzotta was appointed chairman in 1987 by the thenChristian
Democrat-dominated government against the opposition of the Bank of Italy.
It is not clear whether the board or the government nominates a successor.
As it is a Milan bank, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi is
anxious to have a representative on the board.
Mr Bossi yesterday said he was willing to make an electoral alliance with Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, if the latter had no links with
'southern fascism'.
This condition underlined the fact that the central obstacle to a deal
between the League and Mr Berlusconi's nascent Forza Italia (Come On Italy])
movement is Mr Berlusconi'scontacts with the neo-fascist National Alliance.
Mr Bossi was speaking at the opening of the League's three-day congress in
Bologna.
The uneasy marriage between industrial Mestre and historic Venice will be
put to the test for the third time since 1979 in a referendum on Sunday.
Those favouring continued unification of the two communities have a narrow
lead of 51 per cent in the opinion polls.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian authorities yesterday proposed to tackle an estimated
Rbs15,000bn in unpaid bills among enterprises by making them divert part of
their revenues to paying suppliers.
The so-called non-payments crisis, which threatens to drag down potentially
profitable companies along with bankrupt ones, is caused by Russian managers
who, on a massive scale, deliver goods without being able to secure payment
for them.
At the root of the crisis is the fact that bankrupt enterprises are not
being pushed into closing or restructuring, while others, which have money,
are not forced to pay their bills in the absence of basic commercial
discipline.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister, told parliament that in a first
stage, the state would pay some of its own debts to companies on condition
they spent the money on repaying their own creditors. This would include the
payment in the first quarter of Rbs1,500bn owed by the government to the
defence industry, and of another Rbs1,500bn to construction companies and
farms. Tax revenues in the first quarter are estimated at Rbs8,000bn.
In a second stage, the Finance Ministry and central bank proposed to force
companies to allocate part of their revenues to paying off their debts - to
the taxpayer, the workers, and the suppliers - in proportions set by the
government. But this would be possible only if parliament agreed to amend
legislation banning the state from interfering with enterprises' bank
accounts.
The state has some ability to enforce the first plan by paying some of the
money directly to the creditors of the companies it plans to reimburse. But
it is not clear how much room for manoeuvre it will have to enforce the
second, given enterprises' accumulated experience in avoiding obligations.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who was welcomed like a
hero by a parliament which dislikes the country's former radical rulers even
more than he does, said the former government's solution - of introducing
promissory notes which would allow creditors to start bankruptcy proceedings
against debtors - was premature.
Mr Dubinin said he was still committed to the scheme, outlined in a
presidential decree produced with the help of his predecessor, Mr Boris
Fyodorov, but agreed that it needed some more work before it could be
implemented.
Although various courts around the country have already declared dozens of
companies bankrupt, an important obstacle to the scheme is the government's
reluctance to take responsibility for open unemployment.

FT  05 FEB 94 / EU plans closer ties with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union aims to wrap up negotiations on a more generous
partnership and co-operation agreement with Ukraine before the March 27
parliamentary elections, a European Commission official said yesterday.
The announcement of closer ties reflects concern in Brussels over the
collapse in Ukraine's economy and a desire to use the prospect of stronger
western trade and political ties to dampen extreme Ukrainian nationalism in
the March poll.
At the same time, there was continued confusion over whether Thursday's vote
by the Ukrainian parliament had gone as far as ratifying the Start 1
disarmament treaty, although it was widely acknowledged to have removed
obstacles to ratification.
The UK interpreted the vote as a decision to ratify, which it 'warmly'
welcomed, but the US did not go as far. Mr William Miller, the US ambassador
in Kiev, said the US was 'very pleased' that the vote had marked the
'removal of the parliament's reservations to ratification of the Start
treaty'.
During Thursday's debate MPs insisted on more specific details on financial
compensation, security guarantees and dismantlement procedures. Parliament
told the government to finalise these technical agreements with the exchange
of ratification instruments. This leaves a loophole for the Ukrainians on
ratification should the technical agreements not be concluded to
parliament's satisfaction.
Parliament did not ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty on Thursday,
but will reconsider in a couple of weeks.
Meanwhile, EU officials said partnership pact with the Kiev government could
be signed before a similar agreement with Moscow.
High-level talks between Russia and the European Commission continued
yesterday, but there were few signs of progress on the two most difficult
obstacles, the treatment of Russian uranium exports and the need to
safeguard the position of foreign banks operating in Russia.
These issues have held up an EU-Russia partnership accord since President
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels last December.
The uranium dispute is particularly tricky because Russia wants uranium
imports to be subject to the liberal safeguard clause in the planned
partnership agreement; but France wants to protect its own industry, which
supplies its nuclear power programme.
On Monday, EU foreign ministers will discuss progress on the Ukraine and
Russia partnership agreements at a meeting in Brussels. Ministers are
expected to agree to a mandate for the Commission to negotiate proposed free
trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with Estonia likely to
receive more favourable treatment because it has liberalised its economy
faster than its Baltic partners, a Commission official said.
Ministers will probably make clear that the Baltic-EU free trade pacts are a
significant step toward an association agreement with the Union on the lines
of those already agreed with the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania.

FT  05 FEB 94 / US shares slide after Fed pushes up interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices plummeted in New York yesterday after the Federal Reserve
announced the first tightening in US monetary policy in five years, pushing
short-term interest rates higher.
When markets closed on Wall Street last night, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was down 96.24at 3,871.42, a fall of 2.4 per cent, in spite of a ban
on computerised program trading introduced when the decline had exceeded 50
points.
It was the largest one-day fall in the Dow for more than two years.
Losses were particularly heavy in stocks of companies where earnings are
sensitive to interest rate movements, such as banks, utilities and
securities houses.
Investors sold stocks after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, issued a
statement, saying the central bank's open market committee had unanimously
voted for 'a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to
sustain and enhance the economic expansion'.
The statement broke the Fed's practice of staying silent on policy changes.
In congressional testimony earlier this week, Mr Greenspan had foreshadowed
a tightening but left timing in doubt.
His statement yesterday was issued 'so as to avoid any misunderstanding of
the committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming of
reserve market conditions by the committee since early 1989'.
Mr Lyle Gramley, a former governor at the Fed and now chief economist at the
Mortgage Bankers Association, said that the Fed seemed to have adopted 'a
new policy' of openness.
The fall in share prices reflectedinvestor concern that rising interest
rates would slow the economy and possiblybring to an end the long bull run
in equity markets.
The timing of the interest rate increase surprised world financial markets.
It is not expected, however, that European interest rates will move higher
in the wake of the Fed's move.
In London last night, where share prices were also hit in late trading by
the Fed's statement, some analysts were still holding out hope of an
earlycut in bank base rates from 5.5 per cent.
The US Treasury market also reacted badly to the rate rise, which the Fed
achieved through a modest increase in pressure on banking reserve positions.
This increased the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each
other, by a quarter point to 3 1/4 per cent. The benchmark 30-year
government bond finished down  17/32 at 98 21/32 , yielding 6.346 per cent.
On the foreign exchange markets, the dollar strengthened in the expectation
that higher US interest rates would attract money into dollar assets.
In late trading in New York, the US currency had risen almost 2 pfennigs
against the D-Mark to DM1.760, and more than a yen to Y109.30.
Unlikethe markets, Wall Street economists were pleased at the action. Mr
John Lipsky,chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'They have
underscored their seriousness about controlling inflationary pressures by
acting in advance of market expectations.'
The Clinton administration took a relaxed view of the move. Ms Laura Tyson,
head of the president's council of economic advisers, said that a modest
increase in short-term rates was consistent with a projected 3 per cent
economic growth for this year. The administration has been pressing other
industrialised nations to relax monetary policy so as to stimulate economic
growth.
There was no immediate expectation in Washington of a policy change in the
light of the Fed's modest tightening, which still leaves US short-term rates
low by international standards.

FT  05 FEB 94 / BAe revives hope of forging defence link with GEC:
Speculation grows that John Cahill will resign as chairman of British
Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, BERNARD GRAY and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has revived the idea of a strategic link withthe General
Electric Company aimed at creating a powerful single UK defence contracting
group.
The news came as speculation within the company mounted that Mr John Cahill
is to step down as chairman three years earlier than expected.
Mr Cahill's expected departure, which has no connection with the company's
defence ambitions, would follow BAe's Pounds 800m sale this week of Rover to
BMWof Germany which will refocus the company on its main aerospace and
defence activities.
Following the Rover deal a large part of the restructuring ofBAe has been
completed, providing Mr Cahill with the opportunity to step down. His likely
departure also follows unsuccessful attempts to link the company's regional
jet aircraft business with Taiwan Aerospace, with which he was closely
associated.
Mr Cahill, who succeeded Sir Graham Day as chairman in April 1992, may be
replaced by a non-executive chairman appointed from outside the BAe board.
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said the future of the company's core
defence activities ultimately lay in a relationship with the UK's other
leading defence contractor.
'It is not if, it is a question of when,' MrEvans said, although he stressed
that no talks were taking place at present.
Any eventual merger of the two companies' defence activities would create
the world's second largest defence contractor after Martin Marietta of the
US. MrEvans added that the UK could no longer afford two competing
contractors in theshrinking world defence market.
He confirmed the companies held talks last summer on the possibility of
forming a single UK defence contracting company,but the discussions had to
be halted after a report appeared in The Sunday Times. Mr Evans said a link
with GEC was inevitable. Close links would help secure the future of the
UK's strong position in the world defence export market.
But Mr Evans said the company's priority was to stop the haemorrhaging of
cash from its civil aircraft business. Yesterday, BAe announced it was
writing off Pounds 250m for its loss-making turbo-propeller commuter
aircraft division. Mr Evans indicated that BAe would shed other peripheral
activities, including property assets held by its Arlington Securities
subsidiary.
The BMW deal and the announcement about the turbo-prop business were
welcomed by the City. BAe's shares yesterday gained 22p to close at 575p, up
30 per cent on the week.
Mr Evans ruled out that the company would seek fresh funds through a rights
issue. The group
is now looking for joint venture partners for both its regional jet and
turbo-prop operations.
Although talks with Taiwan Aerospace were in limbo, Mr Evans said BAe's
regional jet business had 'hugely improved' after restructuring.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Honda's technology controls threaten Rover deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A tense poker game over the future of Rover Group was developing yesterday
between the company's Japanese partner, Honda, and BMW, the German carmaker
which has agreed to buy the British group for Pounds 800m.
New uncertainty over the controversial deal, which left Honda bitterly
angry, emerged as it became clear that the Japanese company retains a
stranglehold over some of Rover's key models, including the new 600.
Far frombeing an outraged but helpless bystander at the sale of the British
partner, with which it has developed close ties over 15 years, it is
understood that Honda has tight licensing agreements with Rover that place
strict limits on the use the British company may make of the technology used
in its most successful models.
Should Honda, which still retains 20 per cent of the British carmaker,
decide to end the partnership, Rover could be obliged to stop production of
the key 600 and 400 ranges as well as its own 2-litre engines within three
months, or at least until they could be expensively re-engineered to remove
licensed Honda components.
BMW, which carried out its inspection of the Rover groupbefore authorising
the Pounds 800m investment in an unusually short time by motor industry
standards, said yesterday it was aware of the potentially problematic
licensing agreements.
BMW executives also acknowledged that a Honda pull-outwould inflict enormous
damage on Rover. But the company is proceeding with the purchase in the
apparent belief that the loss to Honda of an estimated Pounds 400m annual
revenue from parts sales and other elements of the collaboration will
prevent the Japanese company from taking the step.
'If they think that, theyreally are gambling,' retorted a spokesman for
Honda Motor Europe.
BMWreceived some comfort from Honda yesterday when Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto,
Honda's president, insisted that his company was not seeking to precipitate
an immediate crisis.
He brushed aside suggestions that Honda's relationship with Rover was over
and said the company would consider any proposals from BMW. However, he
believed Honda's relationship with Rover was unlikely to come to an end
overnight.
Both companies are still manoeuvring to gain the maximum advantage from this
latest shake-up in the motor industry.
Rumours that Honda was preparing a counter-offer to the BMW deal played a
part in the sharp rise yesterday in the shares of Rover's parent company,
BAe, helped by news ofa Pounds 250m decks-clearing write-off on its
turboprop leasing business. By last night Honda had denied any prospect of a
counter-offer.
'It is our principle that Rover, which is the last UK car company, should be
controlled mainly by British people,' Mr Kawamoto stressed in explaining why
Honda decided against buying outright the UK carmaker.
Mr Kawamoto, making Honda's first substantive response to the intended
takeover - which has still to be approved by BAe shareholders - said Honda
had been approached by BAe with the possibility of buying the company but
had turned down the offer.
'We are notin the position to take the initiative on Rover so we would like,
first of all,to hear what (BMW) have to say,' Mr Kawamoto noted. 'There are
so many possibilities, we cannot make any decisions about our relationship
with Rover until wehear from BMW.'

FT  05 FEB 94 / O'Reilly buys 25% stake in Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY, DIANE SUMMERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group last night appeared to gain
the upper hand in the struggle for control of Newspaper Publishing,
publisher of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday.
In a swift response to a Pounds 55.1m formal bid from a consortium backed by
Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr O'Reilly's Dublin-based group bought a 24.99 per
cent stake in Newspaper Publishing for Pounds 18.4m, paying 350p a share to
institutional investors. This compares with the MGN offer worth 261.6p a
share in cash and MGN shares, or 250p a share incash.
The MGN consortium holds 47.1 per cent of Newspaper Publishing's shares. It
includes founders of The Independent - one of whom is Mr Andreas Whittam
Smith, editor-in-chief, with 7.45 per cent - and the Italian and Spanish
newspaper groups La Repubblica and El Pais, with 18.4 per cent each.
The sharepurchase seems to leave the consortium offer with little chance of
success unless it is increased. The committee of non-executives directors of
Newspaper Publishing said the MGN bid was too low and it welcomed its new
shareholder, which gave assurances of financial support.
Journalists at The Independent and the Independent on Sunday said they were
'immensely relieved' by news of the stake taken by Mr O'Reilly, who is also
chairman of food group H J Heinz. They saidit appeared to scupper the
consortium's bid. The consortium said last night it would press ahead with
the bid. The Spanish and Italian investors reaffirmed their commitment to
the MGN-backed offer.
MGN said it was too early to say whether there would be an increased bid.
Last night Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, was understood to be
in urgent talks with other members of the consortium.
Brokers moved on behalf of Independent Newspapers soon after the MGN
consortium had launched its early morning offer for the 52.9 per cent of
News-paper Publishing it does not own. Brokers offered institutional
investors 350pa share on 'a first come first served basis'.
At 13.37pm Independent Newspapers was able to announce that it had purchased
24.99 per cent of NewspaperPublishing and asked for representation on the
board.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Anger over Portillo attack on foreign corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday launched an
attack on foreign corruption, which threatened to embroil the party in
another damaging row.
After delivering the speech to students in Southampton, Mr Portillo later
said he had made a mistake in 'grossly exaggerating' the corrupt practices
which take place abroad.
But his comments infuriated some Conservative backbenchers who questioned Mr
Portillo's judgment in making a controversial speech in the wake of the
prime minister's call for party unity.
Mr Robert Hicks, a pro-European, said: 'This is ridiculous. I wonder if he
lives in the real world. Where is the evidence in our community partners
that such practices exist.'
Another senior Conservative MP said: 'Mr Portillo's comments are a severe
embarrassment to the government and Mr John Major.'
Mr Portillo told Southampton students: 'If any of you have got an A level it
is because you have worked at it; go to any other country and when you have
got an A level you have bought it'.
He went on to say: 'When you go into business you will win contracts because
you are good at what you do.
'Go to a number of other countries and you would win contracts because your
cousin was a minister or because you have lined the pocket of some public
official.'
Treasury officials said Mr Portillo did not intend for the remarks to come
out in the way they did.
Mr Portillo later said: 'I realised shortly afterwards that I had
exaggerated and made a mistake. The point I was trying to make is that
Britain's standards in public life compare favourably with the best in the
world.'
His comments follow his last speech lauding British institutions. Downing
Street then blocked a plan by the chief secretary for a further speech
emphasising his Euro-sceptic credentials.
Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said Mr Major should
sack Mr Portillo for his 'outrageous' comments.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: UK life group floats property
portfolio

Transatlantic Holdings, the UK life assurance and property group, is to
float off its retail property portfolio as Capital Shopping Centres (CSC),
which will become one of the seven largest listed property companies on the
London stock exchange.
The company will own the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, the largest
in southern England, which will account for about half of CSC's estimated
gross assets of Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn). At least 25 per cent of CSC
will be sold through a placement and public offer, raising about Pounds
150m.
Transatlantic, 54 per cent owned by Liberty Life, the South African
insurance group, and 19 per cent owned by UAP, France's largest insurer,
will retain about 75 per cent of CSC's shares (issued at net asset value),
its Pounds 600m property portfolio, half of Sun Life and a 3 per cent stake
in Sun Alliance.
The demerger will provide a funding source for a capital intensive part of
Transatlantic's operations, and it could present a more attractive valuation
for its retail properties.
The parent company (Transatlantic) is to raise an additional Pounds 200m
from a convertible bond issue. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said this was to
pay off floating rate debt and the Pounds 162m recently paid to increase its
interest in the Harlequin shopping centre, rather than to increase its stake
in Sun Alliance.
Brokers expected interest in the issue. 'I think the market will like the
idea of having a large specialist retail property company,' said Mr Chris
Turner, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. According to the brokerage, the property
sector is trading at a 19 per cent premium to its asset value, and it is
expected that CSC will be priced above asset value.
CSC will comprise interests in seven shopping centres. Three of these
properties have been built since 1990, and Mr Gordon argues that shopping
centres take between five and seven years to reach maturity.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Kleinwort trust oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The public offer for Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation Investment
Trust was more than Pounds 380m (Dollars 575m) oversubscribed, confirming
its position as the largest UK investment trust launch.
Applications for Pounds 560m-worth of shares were received during the public
offer, which closed on Wednesday, giving the fund a potential size of Pounds
880m, as Pounds 320m had already been raised through an institutional
placing, but it was capped at Pounds 500m.
However, the Mercury European Privatisation Trust, which closed its placing
on Wednesday, has set its maximum size at Pounds 575m, so it could soon beat
Kleinwort's record. The Mercury fund raised Pounds 325m in its placing, and
is seeking a further Pounds 100m from an intermediaries offer, closing on
February 25, and Pounds 150m from a public offer, closing on March 2.
Applications for shares in the Kleinwort trust are being scaled back by
about two-thirds.
Mr Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts,
said the company was disappointed not to be able to satisfy demand in full,
but it believed that Pounds 500m was an appropriate size given the state of
development and liquidity of the target investment area.
If all the disappointed investors from the Kleinwort offer now apply for the
Mercury fund, it will also be oversubscribed. Investors who applied for the
minimum 2,000 Kleinwort shares will receive 700. Applications for up to 2m
shares will be allocated approximately 31.45 per cent, and applications for
more than 2m shares will receive 31.45 per cent of the first 2m and 25 per
cent thereafter.
Shares in the trust are partly paid, with 50 per cent paid initially and the
balance due on August 1. One free warrant will be issued with every five
shares.
Interim share certificates and cheques for returned balances will be sent
out on February 8, and dealings in the ordinary shares and separate warrants
are due to start on February 9.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan stalling talks, says US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior US trade official yesterday accused Japan of trying to renegotiate
the hard-fought terms of the US-Japan trade negotiating framework reached at
last year's Tokyo summit.
At a congressional hearing, Mr Jeffrey Garten, the commerce undersecretary,
said Japanese negotiators were resisting 'point by point' the setting of
'multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria' which would measure
progress in opening its vehicle market.
The US is seeking a 'significant' increase in the number of direct franchise
agreements between Japanese dealers and foreign vehicle manufacturers. It
also wants continued increases in the North American content in cars
produced by Japanese manufacturers in the US.
Japan has sought to position itself on the high ground in its trade
stand-off with the US. American demands for 'benchmarks' to measure import
penetration sectors are being stoutly resisted on the grounds that Tokyo
reformers want less, not more, government intervention in the marketplace.
'We do not seem to have even a common understanding of the problem, let
alone consensus on the solutions,' Mr Garten said. Japanese officials
believe that agreement on 'benchmarks' will evolve into market share
commitments.
Memories of past highly-touted but ultimately ineffectual bilateral trade
pacts with Japan haunt the proceedings. The US has now endured 28 years of
merchandise trade deficits with Japan, with last year's climbing back to
Dollars 59bn.
There is little doubt that a failure of the framework talks would bring
swift congressional action; at the very least it would mean renewal of Super
301, a now expired tough US trade law. Congressman Richard Gephardt is
considering legislation which would direct the Commerce Department to
establish unilateral import targets for Japan, making failure to reach those
targets punishable by sanctions.
US companies might also move quickly. At least one Washington trade group -
Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan - has been researching US trade law in preparation
for private-sector attacks on Japan's exclusionary structure and practices.
Mr Bill Leonard, a Stroock senior partner, says there are three options: an
expansion of the countervailing duty law to cover domestic subsidies which
benefit Japanese companies to the exclusion of US exports; section 337 of
the Tariff Act of 1930, which may enable US producers to exclude imports
produced through exclusionary practices like keiretsu; and section 301 of
the 1974 Trade Act under which the US imposes punitive duties on imports
from countries which unfairly exclude US products.

FT  04 FEB 94 / EU to pressure US on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the European Union are expected to urge the US to take a more
active part in the Bosnian peace process when the foreign ministers of the
Twelve meet in Brussels next Monday.
The French and the British have already done so during direct talks between
their foreign ministers, Mr Alain Juppe and Mr Douglas Hurd, over the past
week. Yesterday, their Dutch colleague, Mr Pieter Kooijmans, also said he
had written a letter in the same vein to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary
of state.
Mr Kooijmans said on Dutch television that he had told Mr Christopher: 'Play
a more active role in the peace talks in view of the terrible alternative -
a war which will demand more victims.'
Mr Hurd, who gave a very similar message to Mr Christopher during his talks
in Washington last Tuesday, did not, however, go as far as the French, who
irritated the Americans by calling upon them to put pressure on the Moslems
to accept the present peace plan dividing Bosnia into three ethnic states.
In the knowledge that such a demand would be flatly rejected by the US
administration, Mr Hurd merely made clear that Britain wanted the US to be
'up front' in the peace process, since that would hasten the day when a
settlement was reached, according to officials in London.
However, Mr Christopher apparently declined to spell out the conditions
under which the US was prepared to take a more active role.
The continued presence of United Nations peacekeeping troops in Bosnia now
appears to be assured, following consultations between the main contributing
countries such as Britain, France, Canada, Spain and Russia.
All the troop contributors agree that a decision should be taken jointly by
them, before the end of March, on the basis of reports by the UN, its
special representative in former Yugoslavia and its new military commanders
on the spot.
Mr Hurd is understood to consider it most unlikely that there will be a
simple decision to withdraw, since the war would then become even more
savage than it already is and the effect on the very people the UN was
trying to help would be catastrophic.
Meanwhile, the new 'hardline, hard-nosed' policy of the recently appointed
UN military commander in Bosnia, Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, has
achieved its first positive results.
Bosnian Serb militia backed down after UN troops threatened yesterday to
send in armoured vehicles to clear a blocked checkpoint 15 miles west of
Sarajevo.

The metal and engineering workers union, IG Metall, suffered the largest
fall in absolute terms, with 247,845 or 7.3 per cent fewer members in 1993.
In percentage terms the gardening, agriculture and forestry union was worst
hit with membership down 13.9 per cent.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Parliament maps out a cheaper route to Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for rebuilding Berlin as the capital of a united Germany have been
sharply curtailed by the parliament's budget committee, Reuter reports from
Bonn.
The budget committee of parliament agreed on Wednesday evening that all
ministries should be housed in existing buildings, either former East German
ministries or military headquarters left behind by departing Allied forces.
Only the new chancellery and government press office due to be constructed
near the old Reichstag parliament building were not mentioned in the
resolution, implying they would be built, committee members said.
Parliament voted in 1991 to move the government from Bonn to Berlin and has
since been mired in debate over how and when to do it. The current target
date for the move is the year 2000. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right
coalition, trying to reduce spending, has said the move should not cost more
than DM20bn (Dollars 11.4bn).
After unification in 1990 many Bonn cabinet ministers made quick
'house-hunting' trips to Berlin, after which they declared they needed new
ministry buildings because the old East German offices were hopelessly
outdated.
The Foreign Ministry firmly opposed moving into East Germany's foreign
ministry, an ugly 1970s high-rise building that mars the otherwise classical
centre of old Berlin.
Several ministries balked at the idea of taking over the squat building that
once housed the Third Reich's central bank and became the Communist party
headquarters after the war.
But the committee, whose recommendations must still be debated in
parliament, said Berlin had so many large buildings - some dating back to
its time as the capital of Prussia - that the present government could
certainly find enough space.
The British, French and US forces that once defended West Berlin will leave
the city by the end of this year, freeing a large number of barracks, office
buildings and commandants' villas for government use.

A sparkling set of results from BSKyB, the 50 per cent-owned satellite
television arm of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, offset a hit from
the recent Sun and Times price cuts. News International, News Corp's UK
subsidiary, rose 21 to 314p.
BSKyB's main UK shareholders, Pearson and Granada, also benefited. Pearson
rose 7 to 725p, with SG Warburg calculating that the conglomerate's 17 per
cent stake was worth 128p a share, against 75p previously. Granada was a
penny off at 579p, but analysts calculated that the benefits of its 13 per
cent stake would be diluted by the acquisition of LWT, up a penny at 696p.
Paper and packaging groups Bunzl and David S. Smith were firm after
encouraging noises from Credit Lyonnais Laing. The house published a wide-
ranging review of the sector, arguing that paper prices are picking up after
a long spell in the doldrums.
It has selected the two second-line companies as core holdings, arguing that
both have 'strong management stories, offer superior earnings and dividend
growth prospects and have indicated that they can add value'. Bunzl put on
10 at 170p and Smith gained 6 at 508p.
A recommendation for Courtaulds Textiles lay behind a rise of 8 to 583p in
the share price. Smith New Court published a hefty buy note on the company,
saying that investors were taking an overly gloomy view following the
cautious trading statement in December. 'From the current base of 4.5 per
cent operating margin we believe the group can achieve a level of 7 per cent
on the back of volume acting on a heavily rationalised cost base,' argues
Smith's Mr Mark Puleikis.
Royal Bank of Scotland was up 18 at one stage on rumours that the banking
group was about to sell its insurance subsidiary Direct Line to French
insurer UAP. Mr Charles Landa, insurance analyst with SGST, said: 'UAP have
shown an interest but Royal Bank had described Direct Line as a core holding
and it does not need the money, so I would be surprised.' The shares closed
5 higher at 515p.
A new pricing scheme from BT intended to build up brand loyalty was
announced but could not help the shares escape the muted market tone and a
bout of profit-taking. They closed 7 down at 470p. But Vodafone firmed 2 to
614p on the back of this week's good subscriber figures.
Water stocks rose on Wednesday's market talk of investments channelled from
European privatisation funds. Among these, South West climbed 9 to 654p,
Welsh 19 to 739p and Yorkshire 9 to 615p.
Insurance group TransAtlantic Holdings announced plans to float off a
property investment company, with property assets of Pounds 740m
concentrated mainly in shopping centres. The stock jumped 33 to 462p.
There was a big seller of Caradon as the shares tumbled 16 to 424p in
turnover of 5.3m.
The rumoured deal at Upton and Southern finally came to fruition when the
regional stores group announced an agreed Pounds 2.44m offer for Reject
Shops. The latter's shares became the day's biggest percentage faller,
slumping 50 per cent before closing 21 down at 38p. The Upton offer valued
each Reject share at 22.37p. Upton, which also announced a 10-for-one rights
issue to raise Pounds 4.5m, added a penny at 6p.
Reverberations of the Dollars 10bn Paramount bid battle continued to focus
attention on the multi-media market and buoy Thorn EMI, the shares adding 17
at 1145p in turnover of 2.6m.
Comment on Euro Disney's mounting losses saw the stock crumble 35 to 375p.
An agency cross in hotel group Stakis pushed turnover to 16m. The shares
were steady at 86p.
Allied-Lyons faded from an initial spurt as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its
positive stance and recommended a switch out of Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The
former closed 3 adrift at 646p, after 654p, while S&amp;N receded 6 to 573p.
British Airways rose 7 to 491p in trade of 6.3m shares after revealing a 9.7
per cent year-on-year increase in January passenger traffic figures.
Metals group Johnson Matthey was making visits around the City and the
shares improved 10 to 605p.
GKN fell 14 to 600p after Smith New Court urged investors to sell the stock.
A feeling that shares in Rolls-Royce had run ahead too far saw the stock
ease 6 to 180p, on volume of 8.7m. News that its US rival Pratt &amp; Whitney
had won an order to supply engines for Japan Airlines also hit sentiment.
The prospect of a successful flotation of Ashanti Goldfields, of Ghana, in
which Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake, continued to excite investors and the
shares firmed 2 to 172p.

FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Pru stake sale hits insurers

The UK's leading insurance company, Prudential, was hit as one of its
principal stakeholders sold 46m shares, the equivalent of a near 2.5 per
cent holding in the company.
The shares were placed with Smith New Court, one of the UK's most aggressive
marketmaking firms, in the form of a bought deal, a situation where the
trading house takes on all the risk - and potential profit.
Dealers said Smith purchased the shares for 350p and placed most of them at
354p, a discount to the underlying share price. They added that the house
could have been holding between 5m and 10m shares by the close of official
trading.
Smith said: 'We consider that we have had a successful placing.' It pointed
out that the trade was carried out under new Stock Exchange rules which
allow publication of big deals to be delayed.
What the market really wanted to know was the identity of the seller.
Potential candidates were Schroders' fund management arm, Mercury Asset
Management, Baring, Britannic Assurance and Postel, all of which have
significant holdings.
Both Mercury Asset Management and Schroders denied any involvement in the
deal, leaving Baring as the most likely seller.
Prudential lost 9 at 362p, with the Seaq ticker showing turnover of 44m
shares.
Other composite and life assurance issues were weak as institutions sold
them in order to take on the Prudential windfall. Legal &amp; General declined
15 to 523p, Commercial Union 17 to 674p, General Accident 24 to 701p and
Royal Insurance 8 to 337p.

FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

Heavy selling in the derivatives market saw the futures contract on the
FT-SE 100 Index record exceptionally high turnover and drag the underlying
market down yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo.
Dealers had expected the previous day's strong performance to continue after
March opened at 3,543 and early demand by locals soon had the contract
moving ahead.
However, the release of disappointing German monetary figures brought a
turnaround in March after the first hour, and an announcement shortly
afterwards that there would be no press meeting following the Bundesbank
Council meeting triggered the day's strong selling.
Confirmation that there would be no German interest rate reduction only
served to increase the general profit-taking by market participants and was
in part responsible for pulling the underlying cash market lower.
The March future traded at a discount to cash for most of the session and
finished the day at 3,494, down 36 from its previous close and around 2
points ahead of its fair value premium to cash which now stands at zero.
Volume was again heavy, reaching 20,757 lots by the official close.
Turnover in the traded options fell to 41,397 contracts from Wednesday's
total of 54,902. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was steady at 17,935, but
the Euro FT-SE option was well down, seeing a mere 1,018 lots dealt. Hanson
was the busiest stock option at 2,287 contracts, followed by Lonrho at
2,258.

FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 backtracks after hitting
all-time high - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The London market's recent upsurge, which has been fuelled largely by hopes
of a series of Europe-wide interest rate cuts, shuddered to a halt yesterday
as Germany's Bundesbank Council left its key rates unchanged.
The council's refusal to shift policy disappointed bulls in the London
market, who had hoped that it might prompt a UK cut.
Matters were made worse by a disappointing opening on Wall Street and a weak
performance by US bonds amid stories that the Federal Reserve was about to
embark on a significant tightening of monetary policy.
Talk of a  1/2 percentage point rise in the Federal Funds rate, a story
circulating around the big US investment banks in London late yesterday,
upset sentiment throughout world markets. London dealers refused to rule out
an increase in US rates but said a rise of a  1/4 point was more likely.
The interest rate story proved the decisive factor in the UK equity market,
where the FT-SE 100 Index continued its recent erratic performance and moved
in a 50-point arc before finishing sharply lower, while the less liquid
FT-SE Mid 250 Index extended its recent strong performance, ending a busy
session at another all-time closing peak, albeit well below the day's high.
Adding to the market's unease yesterday was a sizeable placing of stock in
Prudential, one of the UK's top insurance groups, which was viewed by some
observers as another signal that the equity market might well be reaching
the top of the current upswing. 'Big lines of top-quality stock have been
hard to buy in recent months, but yesterday there was plenty on offer and it
was not clear whether it all got away,' said a senior marketmaker.
Smith New Court, regarded as one of the London market's most aggressive
trading houses, carried out a bought deal involving a near 2.5 per cent
stake in Prudential, although it was unclear whether all the 46m shares
involved in the transaction had been placed.
The session began with share prices being chased higher, after Wall Street's
overnight rise and news of the big boost to the Japanese economy via Pounds
107bn worth of tax cuts. Prices began to falter in midsession, however, when
dealers sensed there would be no German rate cuts. Showing a near 19-point
rise at an all-time intraday record of 3,539.2, the FT-SE 100 thereafter ran
into flurries of selling pressure and dropped as low as 3,490.8 in the
afternoon, before stabilising and ending a net 28.8 off at 3,491.5.
Second-line stocks, on the other hand, continued to attract sustained and
strong buying interest, said to have been associated with the debut this
morning of the new OMLX futures and options contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250
Index. Although finishing below its best level, the Mid 250 still posted a
1.9 gain at a closing high of 4,152.8.
Turnover reached a heavy 1.1bn shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting
for almost 700m shares. Customer business on Wednesday was worth Pounds
2.095bn.
Some dealers said the appearance of large lines of stock seemed to indicate
that the market had over-reached itself and was due for a sharp correction,
but others maintained that a tightening of monetary policy in the US had
already been factored into the market.
'Talk that the Americans are repatriating funds has been around for months
and has not stopped the market from going up,' commented one senior dealer.
