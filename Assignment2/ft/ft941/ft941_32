FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience after
fall led by bonds

Wall Street
US share prices lost ground yesterday after a sell-off in the US Treasury
market put investors on the defensive, but the blue chip indicator finished
well above the day's worst, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chips was finally 7.88 off at
3,967.66, after fighting back from a 25-point deficit at midday. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.29 at 480.71 and the Nasdaq composite
relinquished 1.78 at 797.79. New York SE volume, at 318.3m shares, was heavy
and falls outscored advances at the close by 1,180 to 919.
After a record-breaking session for most market measures and an 11-point
advance by the Dow the previous day, stocks were ripe for a setback. Bonds
provided the trigger, as growing speculation that the Federal Reserve would
soon tighten its accommodative monetary policy sent a shiver through the US
Treasury market. Prices across the yield curve slid, with the benchmark
30-year security down  11/32 to 99 1/4 in late trading.
The day's economic news was mixed, and somewhat inconclusive. The Labor
Department reported a 59,000 jump in weekly claims for unemployment benefit,
but the unfavourable trend was largely blamed on the cold weather and
disruption caused by the Los Angeles earthquake.
The Commerce Department said that December factory orders were up 1.2 per
cent. The figure was strong, but it fell just below the consensus forecast
of 1.4 per cent.
Most investors were focusing their attention on today's report on January
employment data, which may prove to be the last bit of evidence the Fed
requires before taking action.
Share prices of all three big US car makers rallied on news that the big
chill failed to stall January sales. General Motors, boasting a 14.8 per
cent increase in car sales, powered Dollars 1 1/2 ahead to Dollars 63. Ford,
with some impressive light truck figures, gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 69
3/8 . Chrysler kept pace with a Dollars 1 1/4 spurt to Dollars 62 1/2 .
Under the threat of higher short-term interest rates, many banking issues
were set back. JP Morgan, a Dow Industrial component, was Dollars 1 down at
Dollars 70 7/8 , Citicorp shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 and First
Chicago declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/4 .
Retailers also released data on January sales which generally held up well
under the adverse weather conditions. Wal-Mart rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars
28 on the news and the Gap Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 . But Woolworth
fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 5/8 after warning of a fourth-quarter
earnings downturn.
Canada
A further mild retreat was seen in Toronto in record trading volume, leaving
the TSE 300 index 13.1 easier at 4,560.3 and declines outnumbering advances
by 426 to 370. Volume expanded to 106.4m shares.
Maclean Hunter, CDollars 1 5/8 higher at CDollars 17, and Rogers
Communications 'B', CDollars  3/4 lower at CDollars 20 5/8 , continued to be
the focus of much trading activity on Wednesday's news that Rogers intends
to make an offer for Maclean.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses weaken on lack of
German cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's refusal to cut key interest rates, and the high German
December M3 growth rate which preceded it, had a progressively weakening
effect on bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT began by threatening the 2,200 level for the second time this
week, the Ibis-indicated Dax index peaking at 2,193.57 in the pre-bourse,
but an 8.1 per cent growth in December M3 heralded the Buba interest rate
decision and the slide began.
The Dax closed 32.29 lower at 2,151.72 on the session, and just off its low
for the day at 2,137.08 in the post bourse. Mr John Blackley of James Capel
acknowledged that rate cuts were not expected a week ago but said that, this
week, a number of German banks had changed their minds and forecast cuts of
a quarter-point.
Turnover was flat at DM9.4bn. Among interest rate-sensitive stocks,
utilities reflected the Buba news with RWE down DM15.50 to DM475.50 by the
end of the post-bourse, and Veba off DM15 at DM495. Elsewhere, Preussag
dropped DM11.50 to DM451.50 although analysts said that its 56 per cent drop
in 1992/93 net profits was a case for a buy recommendation.
PARIS reflected disappointment at the lack of a German cut, even although
this had largely been discounted by most analysts, while many investors
decided that the time was ripe for profit-taking after Wednesday's record
high.
The CAC-40 index dropped steadily during the session, closing off 33.94 or
1.4 per cent at 2,321.99.
Turnover was FFr5.2bn. The authorities confirmed yesterday that turnover
reached a record level during January, with average daily transactions of
some FFr6bn.
Elf Aquitaine fell back FFr4.70 to FFr426.00 following the announcement
after hours on Wednesday of the public offer price of FFr385 per share. The
offer period lasts until February 10, with the institutional pricing to be
set on February 14.
Euro Disney remained under pressure, down FFr2.70 to FFr33.50, with further
negative news being reported in the domestic media. The shares have lost
some 8 per cent so far this week.
Paribas dipped FFr8 to FFr581 ahead of its 1993 results which, after the
close, were within expectations.
AMSTERDAM saw a 5 per cent fall in Wolters Kluwer, the publishing house, on
reports that subscribers to the group's specialised publications felt that
prices were too high. There were further reports that some subscribers were
calling for a boycott of the publisher's highly profitable legal
publications.
Wolters Kluwer's shares dropped Fl 6.20 to Fl 126.20, but off a session low
of Fl 122.80. A broker at MeesPierson in Amsterdam remarked that he thought
the reports were exaggerated, and considered the sharp decline more the
result of institutions using this as an excuse to take profits: the shares
had risen some 22 per cent since December before yesterday's fall.
KLM was the day's other main story, as the airline announced plans to issue
20m new shares, and reported a rise in third quarter net profit. The shares
lost 80 cents to Fl 48.20, but had been trading at Fl 49.30 during the day.
The AEX index slipped 2.09 or 0.5 per cent to 435.27.
MILAN was hit by profit-taking after its five session rally, and some of the
best recent gainers took the biggest tumbles. The Comit index, calculated
once a day, put on 4.55 to 672.85 but late weakness was reflected in a fall
of 112 in the real-time Mibtel index to 10,693.
Montedison shed L53 or 4.3 per cent to L1,190; its shareholder register
showed that no outsider held more than 2 per cent, confounding speculation
of stakebuilding.
Against the trend, banking stocks continued to benefit from the success of
this week's privatisation of IMI: the public offer sold out in two days and
was heavily oversubscribed. Credito Italiano soared L76 or 3.2 per cent to
L2,474. BCI, facing privatisation later this month, gained L46 to L5,115.
ZURICH finished lower in line with other markets, the SMI index shed 17.2 to
3,159.9.
Among blue chips going against the trend, Ciba bearers added SFr4 to SFr955
on the view that they were undervalued compared with Sandoz. Swiss Re, seen
as having trailed the general market, put on SFr8 to SFr711.
STOCKHOLM marched further into record territory before profit-taking left
the Affarsvarlden index 11.6 lower at 1,591.2. Electrolux B added SKr19 to
SKr400 in further response to Wednesday's better than expected 1993 results.
ISTANBUL dropped 5 per cent, the composite index ending 975.68 lower at
18,487.74, well off its worst, for a two-day loss of 11.9 per cent.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips amid
turmoil as fiscal package delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors were inactive as the turmoil within the coalition government over
the economic fiscal package, including the tax changes, blocked its
scheduled announcement, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 75.21 at 20,174.82 as caution prevailed, due to the
prolonged negotiations within the coalition. The Topix index of all first
section stocks slipped 14.93 to 1,612.73.
The 225-issue Nikkei fluctuated between 20,433.04 and 19,935.19. It was
higher in the morning, with overseas investors and arbitrageurs encouraged
by Wednesday's rise in the Nikkei futures contract in Chicago; but
profit-taking by domestic corporations and financial institutions held sway
later, even though some investors, looking to increase their exposure,
sought bargains at lower levels.
Social Democratic Party opposition to the increase in sales taxes, designed
to finance an income tax cut, prevented the announcement of the economic
support package. The SDP threatened to pull out of the coalition if Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, pushed forward with the Finance
Ministry's plan.
Traders said a compromise was expected, as in earlier political issues such
as rice and political reform, and that the effects of the political
infighting were limited.
Volume totalled 550m shares, against 669m. A bulk of the activity consisted
of cross trading, or selling and buying back of long term holdings to
realise profits. Declines led gains by 808 to 257, with 123 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.39 firmer at 1,333.66.
Profit-taking by corporate investors hurt banks, Industrial Bank of Japan
retreating Y110 to Y3,200. Brokers were also lower, with Nomura Securities
down Y10 to Y2,320.
Honda Motor continued to lose ground due to the lingering effects of the
BMW/Rover deal, dropping Y90 to Y1,530; but Nissan Motor, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y14 to Y855 on foreign buying.
High-tech issues were easier on the higher yen. Fujitsu receded Y20 to
Y1,020 and NEC Y20 to Y1,040.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 246.13 to 21,711.81 in volume of 134.1m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y110 to Y5,190 on profit-taking.
Roundup
The region remained active yesterday, with foreign buying evident in several
markets.
AUSTRALIA rose on overseas buying of major issues and strength in News Corp,
up 52 cents at ADollars 10.56, after the group reported a bigger than
expected increase in interim profits. The All Ordinaries index climbed 28.5
to a record 2,340.6 in turnover of ADollars 972.5m.
BHP finished 28 cents stronger at ADollars 19.50, but off an intraday high
of ADollars 19.60.
HONG KONG posted moderate net gains after profit-taking brought prices down
from their best levels. The Hang Seng index was finally ahead 65.30 at
11,851.13 after reaching 11,947.28.
HSBC Holdings forged ahead HKDollars 4, or 3.3 per cent, to HKDollars 124 as
investors were encouraged by the strong results of the group's US and
Australian units.
MANILA continued to advance, encouraged by news that GNP grew by 2.3 per
cent in 1993, although some profit-taking trimmed the day's best levels as
investors remained cautious after this week's bombings and street protests
over fuel price increases.
The composite index put on 16.85 at 2,922.99. Manila Electric 'B' led gains,
adding 15 pesos at 445 pesos, and PLDT firmed 10 pesos to 2,140 pesos.
SINGAPORE was boosted by selective institutional buying, taking the Straits
Times Industrial index 22.45 higher to 2,360.53. F&amp;N, which bottles
Coca-Cola, rose SDollars 1.10 to SDollars 18.70 on hopes that Vietnamese
trading agreements signed last year might go ahead on expectations that the
US will lift a trade embargo with that country.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off highs on profit-taking which left the composite
index 2.17 ahead at 1,150.21, after a day's peak of 1,158.13. Construction
and Supplies House surged MDollars 2.85, or 52 per cent, to MDollars 8.35 in
heavy volume after the company announced a MDollars 900m timber deal.
KARACHI was propelled higher by blue chips, which posted gains ahead of the
Friday-Saturday weekend. The KSE 100-share index moved forward 36.40 to
2,290.42.
TAIWAN was lifted by financial stocks, which were actively traded in the
last half-hour of the session. The weighted index rose 102.87 to 6,362.08 in
turnover of TDollars 122.9bn, its highest level in nearly a month.
NEW ZEALAND overcame weakness at the opening to close 20.96 points higher in
the NZSE-40 capital index at 2,439.64. Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt
Harvey, in the forestry sector, both gained 8 cents at NZDollars 3.71 and
NZDollars 4.16.
BOMBAY recovered some of its earlier losses in kerb deals before prices
again fell after a special court ordered firms not to accept for transfer
shares linked to the Mehtra securities scandal. The BSE 30-share index shed
35.68 to 4,000.96.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Threefold support for soaring Helsinki
 -Interest rates, economic optimism and foreign buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland has begun 1994 as it ended 1993, as western Europe's top performing
stock market. Already the Hex index has risen 23 per cent this year,
eclipsing the optimists' wildest expectations.
Mr Kim Lindstrom, managing director of UBF Fund Management, admits to being
caught out by the strength of the surge. Like many commentators he expected
the market to carry on rising this year, but at a much slower rate than in
1993 when the Hex climbed 91 per cent. 'At the start of the year, I thought
share prices would rise by 25 to 30 per cent this year; now 35 to 40 per
cent looks more likely,' he says.
At yesterday's close of 1,962 the Hex is within striking distance of its
1989 all-time high of 2,009. Most analysts regard the scaling of this peak
as a mere formality - a matter of weeks, at most.
Three factors continue to drive the market. One is the dramatic slide in
interest rates; the Bank of Finland's 5.25 per cent base rate is at its
lowest for 40 years. This has led to a significant switching out of bank
deposits and, with further cuts in rates expected, there has been an
explosive growth in mutual funds, which are thought to be funnelling as much
as 80 per cent of their funds into domestic equities. On one estimate,
mutual funds now have FM5bn (Dollars 900m) under management, against just
FM570m at the end of 1992.
The second factor is the marked increase in optimism about Finland's
economic outlook. GNP is expected to rise this year for the first time since
1990; the current account should move strongly into surplus; and there are
even suggestions that Finland's 20 per cent unemployment rate has reached
its peak. A dramatic improvement in corporate profitability is underpinning
the optimism.
Finally, there is foreign buying. Foreigners accounted for much of 1993's
big surge on the Helsinki bourse, after restrictions on foreign share
ownership were relaxed at the start of the year. They remain net investors,
thanks to the fundamentals and because a strengthening of the Finnish markka
is providing favourable currency exposure.
Signs that the market has entered a new phase are apparent from the way that
buying preferences have started to change. In recent days, banking and
finance companies, construction issues and real estate investment groups
have come to the fore, eclipsing the big export groups which led the way
during 1993. Forestry, one of the star sectors of 1993, has underperformed
the market this year with a gain of a relatively modest 12 per cent.
As worries about overheating grow, the market advance will inevitably slow
and become less sure. The rise will be dampened further by an increase in
equity supply. A number of groups are expected to launch new share issues to
rebuild recession-weakened balance sheets. There is also a good chance that
the government, finally, will launch its privatisation programme. One
suggestion is that it will initially seek to sell off chunks in
state-controlled companies already listed, such as Enso-Gutzeit, the
forestry group; Valmet, in paper machinery; and Outokumpu, in mining.
The relatively small size of the Helsinki stock exchange - total market
capitalisation is only around FM160bn - has always made it one of Europe's
more volatile markets. With foreigners now accounting for an estimated
FM30bn of that total, the dangers of sudden lurches are all the greater,
particularly if overseas institutions decide to lock in profits or find more
attractive investments elsewhere.
Few anticipate a sudden foreign pull-out as things stand. But there is
concern about developments in the country's giant eastern neighbour, Russia,
where the political climate has changed following the successful showing of
the nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in December's parliamentary
elections. So far the stock market has shrugged off the Zhirinovsky factor,
but should his pronouncements end up being more than mere talk, Helsinki
will be one of the bourses to suffer most.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Doubts over D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's decision yesterday to keep its main interest rates
unchanged unnerved foreign exchange markets and forced a reassessment of
German monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith.
Although views had been split about the likelihood of policy being eased,
many in the market felt that the Bank's actions may prove counterproductive.
The extent to which the rates decision surprised some was captured by the
near record levels of activity in Bund futures and Euromark futures.
The first hint that the Bundesbank might not ease policy came with the
publication of German M3 figures which rose at an annualised 8.1 per cent
last December, well above the 7.2 per cent consensus forecast.
While a high M3 number had been well flagged and the Bundesbank had
indicated that it would be aberrant, many in the market took yesterday's
announcement as a reminder that money supply data would be central to the
Bank's decisions. If this view is correct, the market may have to wait until
the Bundesbank Council's March 17 meeting before policy is changed because
fresh money supply data are not expected much before then.
Observers said the Bank would also want to avoid repeating the error of last
October when it cut rates in anticipation of good money supply figures which
failed to materialise.
Sentiment towards the D-Mark was also depressed by a lack of clarity about
the Bank's repo operations. The Bank has said it will be returning to
announcing a weekly repo rate following a period at which it was fixed at 6
per cent. If a variable rate is announced, the market will take this as a
signal that the Bank is prepared to allow rates to slip below 6 per cent,
thus easing policy.
A number of analysts said the Bundesbank was resolute in its desire to lead,
rather than follow, the market. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC,
said the Bundesbank's strategy, however, risked being counterproductive: 'It
has not noticeably underpinned the D-Mark or the long bund future.' He added
that one could now anticipate enormous speculation every two weeks when the
Bank's council meets. If this is the case it will introduce 'enormous
volatility and instability in the system'.
Other commentators said the Bundesbank tardiness in cutting rates had
increased the risk that impatient US investors in the bund market would
shift their investments into dollars, thus undermining the German currency.
A further possible explanation for the Bank's decision came yesterday from
Swiss National Bank president Mr Markus Lusser. He told a Frankfurt radio
station that US representatives had recently urged Bundesbank officials to
lower rates. He said he had advised the Bundesbank to resist this advice.
In another revealing observation, Mr Lusser added: 'There is no global
economic and monetary policy yet. There is not even a European economic and
monetary policy. And as long as we have only national institutions, national
central banks, that make national monetary policy, then these banks are
responsible to their own economies and citizens.'
Considering the timing and location of the comments and their strong message
of economic sovereignty, analysts said it was likely that Mr Lusser had
cleared his remarks with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president.
The dollar made sharp gains after the close of London trading yesterday on
market rumours of a possible tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal
Reserve.
The speculation was prompted by the Fed's failure to add reserves to the
system when this was widely anticipated. Earlier the US currency had eased
only slightly after the Bundesbank said it was leaving official interest
rates unchanged and after news of a steep rise in US weekly jobless claims.
Although President Clinton has said there is no need to tighten policy, he
appears to be at odds with Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve. US observers believe his congressional testimony earlier this week
was aimed at priming congress for higher rates.
Late yesterday the dollar was trading at Y108.40 and near to the DM1.7450
level, more than a pfennig up from the DM1.7314 at which it closed in
London.
The Japanese yen receded from the spotlight yesterday after details emerged
of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's planned fiscal stimulus package.
Uncertainty about the final shape of the package, and ongoing trade talks
with the US, have left the market nervous. The yen finished in London at
Y108.045 to the dollar, marginally weaker than its Wednesday close.
The dollar ended in New York at Y108.15 and DM1.7415.
Yesterday was a quiet day for sterling, with no important releases and
market attention focused on the D-Mark. Dealers said it continued the recent
pattern of tracking the dollar closely. The pound ended a shade higher in
London at DM2.5937. It also rose slightly against the dollar to finish at
Dollars 1.4980.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with about Pounds 300m of
late unspecified assistance. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 610m after
revising its liquidity shortage to Pounds 1.05bn from an earlier estimate of
Pounds 900m.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels rapped over farm fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Auditors, the European Union's main financial
watchdog, has criticised the European Commission and member countries for
allowing widespread fraud in its Ecu30bn (Pounds 23.6bn) farm budget.
The complexity of EU farm policies encourage abuse particularly in
subsidising exports of surplus farm products, which accounts for a third of
the budget, the auditors said.
The report stated that member countries and the Commission had adopted a
'somewhat minimal approach to monitoring and combating agricultural fraud'.
The auditors accused the countries of having no central monitoring of
companies involved in agricultural trade.
Although a limited number of companies operating in several member countries
received the lion's share of export subsidies, there was no cross-border
co-ordination of the findings of investigations.
The court found that, out of seven countries surveyed, checks were only
regularly carried out in two to ensure that export subsidies were not being
wrongly applied.
The inadequacy of systems for monitoring fraud had meant that the Commission
was extremely slow to recover funds that had been wrongly allocated, the
report found. The auditors pointed to 5,775 cases of fraud and
irregularities over the 1972 to 1991 period involving Ecu725m, of which only
77m had been recovered.
The court called for a system to assess the risk of fraud by product, value
and activities of the company concerned. It said member countries should
co-operate more in monitoring multinational companies.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemen's 'secrets' continue to
elude oilmen - Explorers remain hopeful, though new finds are getting
smaller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Isautier, president of Canadian Occidental Petroleum, remains
sanguine about Yemen's oil industry despite a general decrease in the size
of new discoveries and increasing costs of further exploration. He insists
that much potential remains in Yemen, while acknowledging that more
information is needed before 'the secrets' of the region can be disclosed.
'We are maintaining an active exploration programme in the concession area
where we are already producing. There are smaller structures still to be
tested and we are actively pursuing these since they are close to our
facilities,' Mr Isautier said.
With depressed oil prices affecting exploration budgets CanadianOxy is
currently placing less emphasis on the possibility of large discoveries in
remote areas of its 37,500-square-km concession and more on smaller finds
that can be joined economically to its existing facilities.
Located at al-Masila in southern Yemen, CanadianOxy's oil fields and central
processing facility are linked by a 138km pipeline extending southwards to
export facilities at Ash-Shihr on the Gulf of Aden coast. Since coming on
stream in late September 1993 the company has announced recoverable reserves
of 546m barrels and has reached an average production rate of 135,000
barrels a day, about a third of Yemen's total output.
Although Mr Isautier doubts that the company's production will increase
substantially from existing fields in the coming year he is optimistic about
other possible finds in the area.
'There is still upside potential particularly in the fractured basement,' he
said, referring to the hard rock foundations underlying porous limestone
formations where oil is usually found. 'We now have one well producing 8,000
barrels a day of natural flow, a higher quality oil, and flowing under very
steady, stable pressure. That is indicative of a large well connected area
and it's very encouraging,' he says.
CanadianOxy is meanwhile trading information with other companies adjacent
to its concession area, particularly Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimir, all of which
are working to the north and north-east of the al-Masila fields. In the
current climate of cost effectiveness, traded data saves on exploration
costs and could be especially important for CanadianOxy.
'If those companies make significant discoveries, that would suggest more
potential in the eastern portions of our concession,' says a company
executive.
Based on CanadianOxy's discoveries, oilmen have long suspected a trend
running through the region. But confirmation has so far eluded them. Last
April, Total announced a find capable of yielding 12,000 b/d to the east of
al-Masila and to the north Clyde is currently evaluating results after a
recent strike along its concession line with CanadianOxy. But Lasmo is now
said to have drilled three dry holes, while Nimir has just begun its
drilling programme.
As prospects of large discoveries diminish, oil companies will gradually
have to adjust their exploration programmes, gearing their efforts to
smaller finds near existing facilities to ensure commerciality. But oilmen
insist that even such modest exploration efforts may be uneconomical under
present production-sharing agreements with the Yemeni government.
'The government has tended to think in terms of quick large-scale finds and
has negotiated contracts accordingly,' one says. 'That means small finds
become commercially unattractive and that, in turn, puts a damper on further
exploration.'
But there are signs already that the government is adjusting to the new
conditions, announcing last month extensions in the exploration agreements
of Shell and Clyde. With concession areas ranging from 7,000 to 40,000 sq
km, the added time should enable companies to explore larger portions of
their territory and to evaluate more carefully the data they gather.
CanadianOxy has now been in the country seven years and, as Mr Isautier
points out: 'We still have a lot of ideas to work on to determine the
ultimate potential of our fields'.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee responds belatedly to
Brazilian export move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The May coffee futures price rose by Dollars 16 at the London Commodity
Exchange yesterday to Dollars 1,179 a tonne in a belated response to
Wednesday's news that the Brazilian government would hand over the
management of the coffee retention scheme to the private sector.
The move was encouraged by rumours of heavy buying by a big European
roaster.
Traders were sceptical that the exporting companies would be able to run the
retention scheme more efficiently than the government, but also pushed
prices higher in the expectation that changes in its operation would tie up
some coffee stocks for several weeks.
When the coffee retention scheme, which involves withholding 20 per cent of
exports from the market, began in October the Brazilian government said it
would organise the stockpile for six months. The only surprise in
Wednesday's announcement was that it came in February rather than early
March.
The government had problems keeping 20 per cent of supplies back, but
traders doubted the private sector, which is subject to commercial rather
than political pressures, would manage any better.
While the retention scheme has succeeded in underpinning prices, sharp falls
in production in Colombia and a downturn in Mexican output are expected to
drive prices higher in the next few months.
This week's International Coffee Organisation meeting in London agreed to
retain the organisation as an administrative body conducting studies and
surveys. The decision follows the failure of the ICO to agree on price
stabilisation measures and the US decision to leave the body last year.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Output reduction underpins
continuing rise in price of tin - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of a sharp cut in production at one of the world's biggest TIN mines
underpinned a continuing rise in the metal's price yesterday.
Paranapanema of Brazil said it would produce 6,500-7,000 tonnes of tin in
concentrate in 1994, down from 12,955 tonnes last year. That is equivalent
to about 3.5 per cent of world demand.
At the London Metal Exchange, where the three months tin price gained
another Dollars 95 a tonne, taking its rise on the week so far to Dollars
285.50, traders said, however, that further substantial cuts would be needed
to correct the present oversupply of tin.
The three months COPPER price slipped from an early high of Dollars 1,936 a
tonne to close Dollars 17.50 down on the day at Dollars 1,917.75 as
nervousness continued about the Codelco situation (see story above).
Further gains for SILVER helped GOLD to resume its uptrend but traders' were
divided on whether the move heralded a run-up in prices or would attract
profit-taking.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Import checks fail to appease
fishermen
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday stepped up checks on fish imports from
outside the European Union, in a further effort to appease Breton fishermen
who none the less carried their violent protest to the Channel.
After invading the main Paris fish market in a clash that injured 17
policemen, the protesting fisherman blocked ferry traffic at Calais and
destroyed some Scottish mackerel at Cherbourg.
The European Commission said yesterday it was studying France's demand that
Brussels reinstate minimum prices for seven species of fish, including
salmon. The new French customs checks will be carried out on imports of
non-EU fish, of which Norwegian salmon is the main problem, according to the
French agriculture ministry.
But Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture and fishing minister, yesterday
protested to her French counterpart, Mr Jean Puech, about the 'unacceptable
behaviour' of the French fishermen. She welcomed the latter's offer to
compensate British fisherman for any losses, but said: 'I find it incredible
that such arrangements should be necessary to protect lawful trade between
members of the European Union.'
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, is expected to be greeted
with further protests today when he visits the Breton capital of Rennes.
The government had earlier sought to placate the fisherman by announcing on
Wednesday night special aid of FFr300m (Pounds 34m) for the region's
hard-hit fishing industry, half of it in the form of subsidised loans and
the rest, including FFr27m, to take some of the surplus fish off the market.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US cut announced as aluminium
hits fresh peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alumax yesterday became the second US aluminium producer to announce output
cuts following the unprecedented international trade deal reached at the
weekend by some of the world's big aluminium-producing countries.
It did so as the price of aluminium for delivery in three months reached a
fresh 16-month peak on the London Metal Exchange, moving up another Dollars
26.25 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,302.75. The prospect of the
international deal, which aims to cut global output of the metal by at least
1.5m tonnes to bring the market back into balance, has lifted aluminium's
price by nearly 15 per cent since the begining of 1994.
Alumax will cut annual output by an additional 40,000 tonnes by the end of
March. With curtailments already made, this brings its total to cut 146,000
tonnes a year. It did not say where the latest cuts would be made.
Immediately after the weekend trade deal, Southwire said it would cut 10 per
cent from production at its 170,000-tonnes-a-year Hawesville smelter in
Kentucky. The market is also expecting announcements from Hoogovens of the
Netherlands and Norsk Hydro of Norway, which have both indicated they would
be willing to make more cuts.
Mr William Adams, analyst with the Rudolf Wolff commodities group, said in a
special paper on the outlook for copper and aluminium that 'on balance, it
seems that cuts will be made and that in the long term aluminium prices will
edge higher'. He added: 'Uncertainty in the market is likely to keep prices
underpinned but the market will remain vulnerable to disappointed sell-offs
should the western producers delay cuts.'
Chile Copper Corporation, which has reported losses of about Dollars 200m on
'irregular' futures trading, was a big user of the LME but its activities
were very small compared with the market as a whole, said Mr David King, the
exchange's chief executive, reports Reuter. He said daily LME volume was
over Dollars 3bn and 'while Codelco's activities are very important and
significant to us in relation to liquidity and depth of the market, they are
not so significant (a) that they would cause a problem to the market or (b)
that they would cause financial problems overall to LME members'.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool prices in Australia and South Africa rose to new peak for this season
again this week. The WI market indicator finally ended at 546 cents a kg.
which compares with 522 a week before and makes an increase of 10% in two
weeks. The rise was concentrated in finer Merinos where twice as much is
being paid for some categories as applied in April,1993, the lowest point of
wool's recession. British wool prices also rose very sharply this week, with
increases of 10% to 15% typical. Pressure here exaggerates wool market
strength with offerings at Bradford auctions spasmodic and traders liable to
get oversold in times of recession, such as applied some months ago. At one
or two of the final Australian sales prices did tend to soften a little but
even if a quieter period is imminent the wool market's trend has been firmly
established.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slide as fears mount over Fed
rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds retreated amid speculation that the Federal Reserve would
boost short-term interest rates after the release of today's January
employment data.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at
99 3/16 , with the yield rising to 6.306 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  5/32 to 99 15/32 , to yield 4.265 per cent.
Although the timing of a move by the Fed remained uncertain, some traders
were convinced that action would come soon. Suspicion mounted after the
central bank did not intervene in the market to push the Fed Funds rate down
to its 3 per cent target. For many, this was a signal that a move to the
3.25 per cent level was already under way.
Earlier, bond prices edged higher after the Labor Department said claims for
unemployment benefit had jumped by 59,000 last week. The contraction,
however, largely reflected frigid weather and the impact the Los Angeles
earthquake. Separately, a 1.2 per cent increase in December factory orders
was strong, but in line with the consensus forecast of 1.4 per cent.
During morning trade, bonds reversed course, falling steadily as traders
warily turned their attention to today's payroll figures. Forecasts range
from a gain of 165,000 to one of 200,000. A figure on the high end could
give the Fed's policy-making arm - the Federal Open Market Committee -
sufficient reason to recommend a tighter policy during its meeting today.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates unchanged after its
fortnightly council meeting, and fears that the Federal Reserve was poised
to raise US interest rates weighed heavily on European government bonds
markets yesterday.
Trading was active across Europe, and several exchanges reported record
volume in government bond futures contracts. Following the publication of
worse-than-expected German M3 data for December yesterday morning, few
participants in the German government bond market believed the Bundesbank
would put its credibility at risk by cutting interest rates.
Nevertheless, they expressed their disappointment by driving bond prices
lower, with short-dated maturities suffering the most. Yields on four-year
paper rose eight basis points to 5.20 per cent, while yields on 10-year
paper rose four basis points to 5.75 per cent.
Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the German
government bond market found some comfort in the Bundesbank's decision to
return to its normal practice of announcing the terms of repo tenders on
Tuesdays. The news raised hopes that the central bank could return to
variable rate pacts as early as next week. This would enable the market to
nudge the repo rate lower.
The March bund future on Liffe dropped from the day's best level of 100.45
in heavy trading, to trade at 99.67, down 0.68 on the day.
UK government bonds fell more than a point at the long end as the
Bundesbank's decision to keep rates steady and worries about a rise in US
rates dashed hopes of an early rate cut in the UK. On Liffe, the March long
gilt future plunged  31/32 to close at 117 21/32 . In the cash market, the
benchmark 8 per cent gilt due 2013 dropped 1 1/8 point to 114 1/4 .
Japanese government bonds and futures eased further in London following the
news in Tokyo of a delay in the economic stimulus package due to opposition
from the socialists, the largest bloc in the coalition government.
The March government bond future on Liffe traded at 113.79, down 0.61 on the
day, and compared with a close of 113.85 in Tokyo.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Congo forced to relaunch
Dollars 600m structured deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A complex structured bond issue for the Republic of the Congo, which was
intended to raise Dollars 600m from international investors, has had to be
completely revamped and relaunched due to lack of investor demand for the
original product.
Qwinzy Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based broker, announced last month it had
bought the bonds, with a face value of Dollars 600m. It had hoped to place
them with specialist emerging market investors.
Qwinzy originally structured the deal in the form of zero-coupon 'energy
receivables' bonds maturing in 2003, when the bond proceeds were to be
redeemed using royalty payments from Agip, the Italian oil company with
drilling rights in the republic. The zero-coupon bonds were forecast to
yield between 9 and 11 per cent, according to Qwinzy.
Because of the low level of investor interest, Qwinzy, which initially
purchased the bonds in a bought deal, has renegotiated a lower purchase
price for the bonds, according to Mr Neil Miller, managing director of
Anglo-Oriental Investments, the London arm of Qwinzy. He said the original
terms of Qwinzy's agreement with the Congo allowed for renegotiation of
terms in the event of placement problems.
The new-look structured deal consists of Congo bonds securitised by 10-year
US Treasury bond principal (bonds stripped of their coupon, and carrying a
triple-A credit rating) with a 10 per cent coupon made up of the Agip
'receivables' or royalties.
As a result of the restructuring, the Congo will receive about Dollars 250m
instead of the estimated Dollars 500m in the original deal.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Bonds: SG Warburg leads quiet day with Pounds
125m offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an otherwise quiet day in the Eurobond market, the S. G. Warburg group
raised fresh capital in the sterling bond market with an issue of
subordinated debt. The Pounds 125m offering of subordinated perpetual bonds
pays a coupon of 9 per cent and is priced to yield 225 basis points over the
8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017.
The spread tightened to 220 basis points at the bid price towards the close.
Market participants said most of the paper was likely to have been
pre-placed by lead manager S. G. Warburg Securities. According to an
official there, most of the bonds went to investors in the UK and the
Channel Islands, although he also reported some continental buying.
The slide in gilts, which fell by more than a point at the long end, sent
traders scrambling to cover positions in recently issued paper. Jittery
markets and the uncertain interest rate outlook may limit further issuance
in the near term, traders said.
In the D-Mark sector, Dresdner International Finance issued DM100m of
so-called leveraged 10-year floating-rate notes. The notes pay a fixed
coupon of 5 1/8 per cent for the first two years, and two times 6-month
Libor minus 6.9 per cent for the third year.
According to lead manager Dresdner Bank, the notes are structured so that
their price rises as long-term interest rates rise. They are targeted at
investors who expect German short- and long-term rates to rise, although
investors are protected from near-term rate cuts by the two-year fixed-rate
coupon.
The structure is the mirror image of the so-called reverse floaters, which
have gained popularity in the past few years. According to the lead manager,
the leveraged floater effectively represented the 'synthetic short selling
of an eight-year bond and is the result of a double long position in an FRN
and a short position in a bond with a fixed coupon of 6.9 per cent'.
It is a typical bear-market instrument, and is 'ideal as part of a portfolio
of fixed income securities - it is a hedge instrument for fixed coupon
bonds,' said the lead manager.
The other structured D-Mark deal was a DM100m 10-year issue of floating
fixed-rate notes for the World Bank via Mitsubishi Bank. The bonds pay a
floating-rate coupon of 27 1/2 basis points above 6-month Libor for the
first five years, and then a fixed coupon of 6 3/8 per cent. They are
callable after five years.
The lead manager said the bonds were placed with institutions in continental
Europe and Japan.
'It's an odd view to take - most people expect rates to fall first and then
to rise, so you have the worst of both worlds if you hold this paper,' said
one trader. 'Mitsubishi Bank probably identified specific demand for this
type of paper from an investor and tailored the deal around that,' he said.
In the French franc sector, French carmaker Renault issued FFr2bn of 10-year
bonds via Societe Generale. The bonds were priced to yield 56 basis points
over the 5 1/2 per cent OAT due 2004 and closed at that spread. According to
the lead manager, the bonds met good demand, mainly from French investors
attracted by the yield pick-up.

After a record year for futures business in 1993, some of the world's
leading futures exchanges had a record month in January.
Volume at the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's busiest exchange, jumped
40 per cent in January, to 16.8m futures and options contracts, after
setting a world volume record of 178m contracts in 1993.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it traded 14.2m futures and options
contracts in January, a 21 per cent increase over last January. However, for
the first time it included turnover linked to options expirations, options
exercises, deliveries, and other off-floor activities. Without the new
accounting methods, CME volume was 13.3m contracts, a 13.5 per cent gain.
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, the world's
third-largest futures exchange, traded a record 12.6m contracts in January.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sweet success for Saudi banks -
The 1993 reporting season has been jam today, but what of 1994?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first rash of Saudi banks reporting 1993 figures has shown continued
buoyancy in what has been one of the Middle East's most profitable banking
markets since the Gulf war - but analysts are cautioning that economic
pressures on the kingdom are almost certain to trim profits this year.
The continued weakness in the oil price - the overwhelming determinant of
the Saudi economy's health - has already shrunk economic activity, according
to bankers in Riyadh.
This, plus the government's attempt to attack its fiscal deficit through a
20 per cent across-the-board cut in public spending, is estimated by some
economists in the kingdom to foreshadow shrinkage in the economy of between
5 and 7 per cent for 1994, with attendant effects on bank performance. '1993
will be a nice year to look back on,' said one banking analyst.
However, among the first of the kingdom's commercial banks to report 1993
figures, Saudi Hollandi Bank, which is 40 per cent owned by ABN-Amro Bank of
the Netherlands, recorded a 34.5 per cent rise in net profits to a record
SR180.1m (Dollars 48m).
The bank, one of only two of the kingdom's listed commercial banks not to
have recapitalised on the Saudi stock market over the past two years, said
it would transfer all 1993 earnings into general reserves and pay no
dividend.
In a statement, the bank said it would set aside SR50m for loan loss
reserves. Deposits slipped to SR8.44bn from SR8.48bn. Total assets rose to
SR15.1bn from SR13.52bn.
Saudi Cairo, meanwhile, announced a 59.4 per cent rise in profits for 1993
to SR214.3m. The figure marks a strong recovery from the bank's struggle
with bad debt in the late 1980s - Saudi Cairo recorded no profit in 1991,
but wiped out much of its bad debt portfolio with a recapitalisation in
1993, doubling paid-up capital to SR1.2bn with a 6m share offering.
The bank, in which Egypt's Banque du Caire holds a 20 per cent stake, said
it had allocated SR40m for loan loss provisions in 1993 and will pay a
dividend for the first time in nine years. The board recommended a SR120m
payout, or SR10 a share. Assets rose to SR15.6bn from SR13.4bn a year
earlier.
Arab National Bank, which is 40 per cent owned by Arab Bank, the Jordanian
pan-Arab bank group, also reported a rise in 1993 profits, up 28.7 per cent
to SR495.2m. The board has recommended a dividend of SR337m, a third up on
1992. Loan loss provisions were held at SR62m and assets rose to SR32.41m
from SR28.65.
Saudi American Bank, in which Citicorp holds a 30 per cent stake, announced
a 3.5 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to SR942.2m - a figure in line
with analyst's expectations and based, according to the bank, on continued
strength in the retail sector. Assets rose to SR39.79bn from SR38.28bn, and
deposits were up to SR30.07bn from SR29.06bn.
The bank doubled share capital in 1993 to SR1.2bn with a SR600m transfer
from reserves. Shareholder funds in 1993 rose to SR3.24bn from SR2.62 after
an SR820m increase in general reserves from SR200m.
Analysts said Saudi American's more modest proportionate rise in profits
reflected both the fact that it has been operating more profitably than most
other Saudi banks for longer and that, unlike many of its competitors, it
did not inject equity during 1992 or 1993 - something which had offered some
other banks the use of essentially zero-cost fresh funds.

Amcor, the Australian paper group, yesterday announced an asset swap deal
between its Montreal-based Twinpak subsidiary and Ontario-based Bonar.
Twinpak will shed its North American paper sack and industrial plastic bags
manufacturing business, but take on the bulk of Bonar's coating and
laminating business in eastern Canada. Amcor declined to disclose sales of
the businesses involved.
The Australian company also announced that it had agreed to acquire a small
plastic bottle manufacturing plant in New York State, its first move into
the US. Amcor has been steadily building an international operation

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: New options give fund
managers a wider choice - The prospects for new derivative instruments on
the FT-SE Mid 250 stock index launched today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of futures and options on the FT-SE Mid 250 index today on OMLX,
the London-based equity derivatives exchange, could not have been better
timed.
The path for OMLX is far from smooth: in three weeks, Liffe, Europe's
largest futures exchange, will weigh in with its own FT-SE 250 futures
contract (though no options), which will be traded alongside its already
successful FT-SE 100 futures and options.
But the omens for at least one successful Mid 250 product are good. After
outperforming the FT-SE 100 index last year, the FT-SE 250 index of
medium-sized companies stormed to new highs in January.
'The dramatic outperformance of the FT-SE 250 has highlighted the
opportunity - or missed opportunity - provided by the mid-cap sector,' said
one fund manager.
In addition, a growing number of UK fund managers are starting to use the
FT-SE 350 index (which is made up of the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices) as a key
benchmark for measuring their performance. The FT-SE 100 index is widely
viewed as 'not representative' or 'too specialised' for performance
measurement purposes, while the smaller FT-SE All-Share stocks are seen as
too illiquid.
'I would be surprised if more (fund managers) do not move over to the 350 in
the next couple of years,' said Mr Mel Stimpson, an investment manager at
Standard Life.
Many have already made the switch. 'We are split into large and small
companies. When the new indices (the FT-SE 350 and FT-SE SmallCap) were
introduced, we incorporated them as separate benchmarks,' said Mr Jeremy
Dyer, portfolio manager at Scottish Amicable.
For fund managers who track these indices, the new futures contracts on
Liffe and OMLX will facilitate switches between these sectors for asset
allocation purposes. Other uses include hedging existing portfolios, writing
options against stock holdings to enhance returns, and playing the spread
between the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices or the cash market.
Mr Dyer said he would be keen to use the new products providing there is
sufficient liquidity, and added that he hoped to see the introduction of
futures on a smaller companies index in the future.
Although the FT-SE 100 futures on Liffe are actively traded - a daily
average of close to 17,000 contracts in January - the size of the market is
relatively small compared with the UK market capitalisation.
Attitudes are changing towards the use of derivatives - for example, many
trustees have amended their deeds to allow at least limited use of
derivatives - but it is a slow process.
'Derivatives are redefining people's views of performance. If you want to
outperform the stock market, you can just buy the futures and stick the rest
in T-bills,' said Mr David Courtney, marketing director of OMLX. 'Those who
are becoming more active in derivatives are typically performing well rather
than badly relative to the index.'
But some observers doubt whether there will be sufficiently broad demand to
create liquid contracts. And no one seems to think that the market is large
enough to support the two rival contracts on OMLX and Liffe.
On the face of it, Liffe should be the favourite. It already trades FT-SE
100 contracts, as well as a broad array of interest rate products, and is
the obvious port of call for most brokers.
But fund managers, some of whom had not previously come across OMLX - which
traded an average of nearly 23,000 Swedish stock index options in January -
have been impressed by the smaller exchange's speed in getting the new
contracts off the block and in marketing them. Further, Liffe's track record
in equity derivatives has been less impressive than its performance in
interest rate products.
From the point of view of the fund managers who will be served by the new
contracts, the advent of competition for Liffe is welcomed. Few investors
expressed fears that liquidity will be split between the rival contracts.
OMLX said yesterday that it would have 10 market makers and eight designated
brokers on its FT-SE 250 contracts. Market makers will be obliged to quote
two-way prices, but there is no minimum bid/offer spread.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: JCI lifts interim payout after
8% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, the South African platinum and
gold-mining group with significant diamond trading and industrial interests,
has reported an 8 per cent improvement in pre-tax profit to R179.6m (Dollars
52.6m) in the half-year to December 31 from R165.7m a year earlier.
The interim dividend is increased for the first time since 1989, up nearly
10 per cent to 46 cents a share.
Sharply improved contributions from JCI's gold mines offset mixed fortunes
at its platinum, coal and base metal businesses, which were hit by poor
commodity prices. The mining house continued to rely on its industrial
interests for the lion's share of its income, largely through minority
stakes in the strongly-performing foods supplier Premier Group and South
African Breweries.
After-tax profit rose to R165.5m from R155.6m, after an increase in tax
provisions to R14.1m from R10.1m.
However, earnings at the equity accounted level climbed more than 10 per
cent to R194.9m, as the group's share of earnings from associate companies
jumped to R31.1m from R20.9m.
Currency costs incurred with JCI's decision in 1993 to increase its interest
in Minerais, a Luxembourg-based metals trading company, led to a R10.4m
extraordinary charge taken below the line.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan looks for US help to
open markets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, in Tokyo this
week may have put Japan's trade and finance ministry bureaucrats on the
defensive, but some in the Japanese administration are counting on US
pressure to open the country's financial markets.
After many unsuccessful years trying to persuade Japan's ministry of finance
to deregulate its tightly guarded public pension fund management, the
ministry of health and welfare - which holds jurisdiction over the state
pension system - believes that only foreign pressure can do the job.
US pressure forced the partial liberalisation of fund management, corporate
pension and mutual aid associations in 1990, allowing foreign investment
managers into the market. The welfare ministry also wants better returns on
the state pension investments, currently restricted to life assurers and
trust banks.
For many European and US fund management companies, which have failed to
gain access to such funds due to the tight relationships between Japanese
corporations and fund managers, winning public fund management contracts is
the only way they can justify maintaining operations in Japan.
Investment of state pension fund reserves totalling an outstanding
Y100,000bn (Dollars 925bn) is controlled by the finance ministry, with the
bulk funnelled into low interest loans for public works.
Of the remainder, Y20,000bn is invested by the Welfare Service Public
Corporation (Nenpuku), run by the health ministry - but rigid rules still
govern how the organisation invests in the financial markets.
The health and welfare ministry also wants to alter legislation limiting the
state pension fund investment during the current parliamentary session.
Another big concern is the large amounts allocated to one manager by
Nenpuku. The organisation is only allowed to allocate funds to 14 life
assurers and 15 trust banks, with one institution managing as much as
Y2,000bn.
Deregulation of the pension fund market is on the agenda for the bilateral
trade talks between Japan and the US, with the deadline set for July.
However, the Japanese welfare ministry is trying to convince bureaucrats at
the finance ministry to open state pension fund investments during budget
negotiations this month.
Laws governing the state pension system are reviewed only once in four
years, and government officials say changes on the system and investments
must be made together by April.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Productivity boost helps CMI cut
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Productivity improvements and the rand's weakness against the dollar helped
Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), South Africa's second largest
ferrochrome producer, reduce its pre-tax loss to R3.8m (Dollars 1.1m) in the
half-year to December 31 1993 from R21m the year before.
Sales revenue fell to R118.2m from R125.7m as worldwide oversupply of
ferrochrome, a key ingredient in the manufacture of stainless steel, and
high stock levels ensured prices remained depressed.
Mr Zed van der Walt, managing director, said any benefit from record demand
for stainless steel in 1993 was cancelled out by the surfeit of cheap
ferrochrome supplied from the former Soviet Union and China. The company's
ferrochrome furnaces were operating at 50 per cent capacity although good
export orders for chrome ore allowed its mines to produce at full tilt.
CMI reported a reduced operating loss of R1.78m against R16.8m but fell well
short of being able to cover its interest charges and preference share
dividend payments. Mr van der Walt said minor improvements in sales volumes
or the exchange rate would see CMI return to operational profitability in
1994, and there was still room for the company to cut variable costs at its
smelters.
Lower interest rates and an improved cash position contributed to a fall in
net interest to R2.03m from R4.19m on interest-bearing debt of R143.4m, up
from R136.3m. The payment of the R5.18 interim preference dividend left CMI
with an attributable loss of R9.01m compared with R26.1m.
Mr Alan Kuhnert, marketing director, said world ferrochrome demand would
rise in tandem with increased stainless steel consumption in 1994. South
African producers, with half of their overall capacity lying idle, were well
placed to profit from the increase as output from the former Soviet Union
stagnated.

TMB's profits rose more sharply than those of other leading banks such as
Bangkok Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank, but some analysts
believe TMB will not be large enough to compete effectively against its
rivals as the Thai financial sector is liberalised and opened more to
foreign banks.
Siam City Bank reported a 68 per cent rise in its net profit to Bt1.98bn in
1993 from Bt1.17bn the previous year. The two banks have yet to divulge

quarter

<TEXT>
Rubbermaid, the US household goods company named America's 'most admired
company' by Fortune magazine last month, yesterday reported a 15 per cent
increase in net profits to Dollars 50.8m for the fourth quarter.
The company also reported a 15 per cent increase in earnings for the full
year, taking net income to Dollars 211.4m and maintaining the company's
long-standing record of delivering annual earnings growth of around that
level.
Earnings per share were 14 per cent ahead for the quarter at 32 cents and 15
per cent ahead for the year at Dollars 1.32, excluding a charge in the
previous year for accounting changes.
On Wall Street, Rubbermaid shares closed up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 .
Rubbermaid won its 'most admired company' accolade in a Fortune survey of
10,000 senior executives, outside directors and financial analysts. The
magazine cited Rubbermaid's record of innovation in the manufacture of
otherwise mundane goods like dustpans, dish drainers and plastic storage
crates.
Mr Wolfgang Schmitt, chairman and chief executive, said record introductions
of innovative products were one of the main factors behind a 9 per cent
growth in turnover to Dollars 472.9m for the quarter and to Dollars 1.96bn
for the year.
All the increase in turnover had resulted from volume growth, Mr Schmitt
said, because productivity gains and stable resin costs had produced cost
savings that allowed the company to keep prices flat.
Mr Schmitt said sales growth had been helped by strong performances from the
home products division and the Little Tikes toys division. Specialty
products and commercial products had also shown improvements and the office
products division had continued its recovery.
He said he looked forward to another record performance in 1994 in spite of
the slow pace of growth in the world economy.

<TEXT>
Imasco, the financial services, tobacco, fast food and retailing group,
missed its target of 15 per cent growth in profit last year because of
special charges.
Imasco, which is 40 per cent controlled by BAT Industries of the UK, owns
Canada's biggest trust company, which is now transforming itself into a
bank. It manages CDollars 105bn (USDollars 79bn) in assets.
Fourth-quarter net profit was CDollars 125m, or CDollars 1.02 a share, up 13
per cent from CDollars 104m, or 88 cents a share a year earlier. Net
revenues were little changed at CDollars 2.4bn. For the full year, profit
was CDollars 409m, or CDollars 3.26, up 7 per cent from CDollars 380m, or
CDollars 2.97, on net revenues of CDollars 7.9bn, little changed.
However, if special charges incurred in the sale of a US fast-food unit are
deducted, earnings would have been up about 14 per cent last year.
Tobacco products continued to be the biggest single contributor in 1993,
followed by financial services, retailing, US fast-food and property.
For the full year, financial services were lower and fast-food improved, as
did the drug-store group. The UCS retail chain continued to lose money.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: ITT in line with expectations
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate with operations spanning financial services, hotels
and manufacturing, met market expectations with a steady advance in
operating results in all its main business areas in the final quarter of
1993.
After-tax profits for the period were Dollars 219m, or Dollars 1.67 a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 617m a year before, when the company took a
variety of charges on its consumer finance and paper businesses.
The figures do not include figures for the forest products business, which
ITT said in December will be spun off to shareholders.
ITT Hartford, the group's insurance company, recorded a 26 per cent rise in
operating income, excluding portfolio gains, largely as a result of improved
underwriting experience in the casualty business.
Insurance earnings were Dollars 719m, while earnings in the consumer finance
business rose to Dollars 271m from Dollars 175m.
Manufactured products, which saw a rise in operating earnings to Dollars
310m from Dollars 103m, benefited from higher anti-lock break sales in the
US and cost reductions. These pushed up earnings at ITT Automotives by 40
per cent year-on-year.
ITT Sheraton saw a 40 per cent improvement in earnings in its US operations
from a year before, lifting operating earnings in the hotels business to
Dollars 78m from a loss of Dollars 26m the year before.
For the year as a whole, ITT reported net income of Dollars 913m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 885m the year before.
On Wall Street, the company's shares rose Dollars 1 1/2 to close at Dollars
100 7/8.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: CAE takes CDollars 429m charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CAE, the international flight simulator maker, has taken a CDollars 429m
(USDollars 327.4m) charge to cover problems at its US subsidiary, CAE-Link.
Link, acquired in 1988, has suffered a sharp decline in military simulator
and flight training orders in the past three years.
Mr John Caldwell, CAE president, said: 'Virtually no new military programmes
will be awarded before 2000 and this write-down aligns the value of Link
with this outlook.'
Link has halved its payroll to 3,800 and more jobs will be lost this year,
Mr Caldwell said.
However, he said profits were improving and Link would move into navigation
systems. The order backlog stands at CDollars 600m.
After the special charge, CAE reported an overall net loss in the third
quarter of CDollars 419m, or CDollars 3.86 a share, against net profit of
CDollars 10.9m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 264m,
compared with CDollars 254m.
The nine-month loss was CDollars 405m, or CDollars 3.73, against a profit of
CDollars 23.6m, or 22 cents, on revenues of CDollars 768m, up 5 per cent.
Before special charges, profit was CDollars 33m, against CDollars 32.7m.
CAE's Canadian business has been affected by lower commercial aircraft
simulator orders.
Rio Algom, the Canadian mining group, raised CDollars 180m with its issue of
shares and warrants, or CDollars 23m more than originally estimated.
Canadian Pacific's Fording Coal unit is buying a large high-grade
wollastonite deposit in north western Mexico. The mineral is used as a

Inco, faced with the lowest nickel prices in six years, posted a
fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 39.2m, or 36 cents a common share, against
a loss of USDollars 30.1m, or 28 cents, a year earlier, on net sales of
Dollars 516m against Dollars 612m.
Helped by a strong third quarter, the world's leading nickel-copper-platinum
producer reported net profit for all 1993 of Dollars 24m, or 22 cents,
against a loss of Dollars 22.3m, or 21 cents, on net sales of Dollars 2.13bn
against Dollars 2.56bn.
The results were slightly worse than analysts expected. The figures are
stated after preferred dividends in both years.
In 1993, Inco included a Dollars 187m gain from the sale of a subsidiary.
Realised nickel prices were the lowest since 1987, said Inco.
The average was Dollars 2.42 a pound in the fourth quarter and Dollars 2.72
in all 1993, down 20 per cent from 1992.
Inco reduced output by 33m lbs last year and will make another cut of 40m
lbs in the first quarter this year.
LME cash prices have strengthened recently and Inco says its production
plans for the remainder of 1994 are flexible.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Steelmakers' optimism tempered
by overcapacity - Surge in US demand masks problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years in which they racked up combined operating losses of
Dollars 3bn, any numbers not swathed in red ink are apt to make the US's
large steel companies feel almost light-headed.
But 'Big Steel' - the collective name given to the country's six big
integrated steelmakers - still has a long way to go to justify the optimism
that has driven share prices in the sector ahead this year.
Without doubt, the steel-makers look in better health than for some years.
Buoyed by a domestic economic recovery that has lifted demand for steel from
the automobile, appliance and construction industries, they reported a
combined operating profit of around Dollars 100m in the third quarter of
last year - their first since the third quarter of 1990.
Operating profits climbed to Dollars 150m in the final three months of the
year.
The big companies - USX's US Steel subsidiary, Bethlehem, LTV, Inland,
National and Armco - have also bolstered their collective balance sheet
after the ravages of the last downturn.
In the past year, they have sold Dollars 1.5bn of ordinary and convertible
preference shares between them in a binge of capital raising. That is set to
continue, with Armco and Kawasaki Steel of Japan last week announcing plans
for a Dollars 590m recapitalisation (Dollars 315m of it equity) for their
Armco Steel joint venture.
A sharp improvement in the US steel market lies behind the turnround, and
investors' demand for the steelmakers' shares.
Last year, US makers of cars and appliances increased orders for flat-rolled
steel, which is the staple product of the big steelmakers.
Mini-mills, which make steel from scrap melted in electric furnaces,
dominate the market for structural products, rods and bars, though some have
targeted the flat-rolled market.
US steel companies shipped 87.5m tons last year, according to a Salomon
Brothers estimate, up around 6 per cent from 82.2m the year before (which
itself was 4 per cent higher than the trough of 1991).
The biggest growth is likely to have come in flat-rolled products, which
account for around half the market and sales of which grew by some 8 per
cent during 1993.
Nor is there any sign of a surge in imports - though that may follow if the
US dollar continues to strengthen.
Last July, when the US's International Trade Commission refused to confirm
some of the tariffs which had been imposed on imports by the country's
Commerce Department, the domestic industry braced itself for a new wave of
imports.
It did not come. Imports remain at around 17 per cent of the US market, 10
points lower than a decade ago. They could fall further, if US steel-makers
increase their domestic output and stop importing semi-finished steel to
feed their mills.
Perhaps even more important for the big producers, domestic rivals - which
have provided tougher competition than foreign steelmakers in recent years -
have had their own problems.
The mini-mills have been hit by a sharp rise in the cost of scrap, which has
wiped out much of their cost advantage.
'Some scrap prices are double what they were a year ago,' says Mr John
Jacobson, a consultant at the Wefa Group.
The result has been a rapid increase in steel prices. Hot-rolled sheets were
selling at Dollars 360 a ton at the end of last year, 20 per cent more than
at the start of the year. The price of cold-rolled sheets had risen by 16
per cent, to Dollars 487 a ton. These price rises have yet to feed through
fully into the steel companies' figures, however.
Many supply contracts have yet to be renegotiated. There have also been
reports that big carmakers have succeeded in holding out against the full
price rises.
It is not surprising the steel companies feel more optimistic than for some
time. But their recovery needs to be put in context.
Steel prices are still well below the level reached in 1988 and 1989 - when
steelmakers enjoyed a brief respite between the long slump of the early
1980s and the more recent dip.
Slow economic growth in Europe and Japan, adding to the overcapacity in the
worldwide steel industry, is likely to prevent prices rising much further.
The construction of new mini-mills in the US - some built by the big steel
companies - will add to capacity over the next two years, further holding
back prices.
In addition, the operating profits of the big steel companies look fragile
when set against combined sales running at around Dollars 5bn a quarter. At
the after-tax level, the steelmakers have yet to break back into profit
(though that should come this year).
The big steelmakers also continue to be weighed down financially by the sort
of problems that newer, low-cost rivals do not face. Bethlehem Steel took a
Dollars 350m charge in the last quarter to cover restructuring in its
structural products division, an area where it is in most direct competition
from the mini-mills.
Falling long-term interest rates have pushed up the steelmakers' pension
fund liabilities: Bethlehem pumped Dollars 260m into its pension fund in
1993, but still saw the fund's deficit rise to Dollars 1.6bn, from Dollars
1.2bn the year before. LTV, emerging from bankruptcy last summer, put
Dollars 1.4bn into its pension plans, and intends to contribute Dollars 579m
more this year.
Concerns like these have tempered optimism among the steelmakers, in spite
of their full order books.

Reader's Digest exceeded Wall Street's expectations by posting a 25 per cent
improvement in net income in the three months to end-December, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The New York-based publishing group announced net income of Dollars 88.8m,
or 76 cents a share, in its second fiscal quarter.
This compared with Dollars 70.3m, or 59 cents, in the corresponding period
in 1992.
On an operating basis, profits were 30 per cent ahead after stripping out
the adverse effect of currency fluctuations.

Argentine carmakers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE controlling shareholders of Argentina's two listed carmakers have said
they plan to continue reducing their stakes through block sales in the
Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.
The announcements follow steadily growing overseas demand for shares in
Ciadea, the locally-controlled company that makes cars under licence from
Renault of France, and for Sevel, which holds the Peugeot and Fiat licences.
Mr Mauricio Macri, Sevel's president, said the company's controlling
investors plan to reduce their holdings to 60 per cent from 84 per cent.
Fiat of Italy holds 14 per cent of Sevel and the Macri family owns 70 per
cent. The remaining 16 per cent is in the market.
The Macri family sold 2.25 per cent of Sevel in a block trade at the end of
January for Dollars 19.9m. This follows Dollars 33.5m in block sales in
December. The buyers were not identified, but are believed to be
international investors or investment funds.
Mr Manuel Antelo, Ciadea's president and principal shareholder, said the
Luxembourg-based Cofal company that controls Ciadea plans to continue
selling stock in block trades to cut its holding to 51 per cent from 58.8
per cent .
When Cofal took over the company from Renault in 1992, 28 per cent of its
shares were in the Buenos Aires market and the remaining 72 per cent held by
Cofal, owned by Renault, Mr Antelo and others.
Cofal has sold Dollars 144.6m of Ciadea equity through Buenos Aires stock
exchange up to the end of December. Most was sold to London-based brokers
Smith New Court and Baring Securities.

Delta Air Lines, one of the three biggest US carriers, is to drop two more
transatlantic services as part of its continuing efforts to restore profits
to the portfolio of international routes it bought from Pan Am in 1991.
Its daily non-stop service between San Francisco and Frankfurt will stop at
the end of April, and its three-times-a-week non-stop service between New
York and Budapest will be abandoned at the beginning of May in favour of a
code-sharing agreement with Malev Hungarian Airlines.
After the latest cuts, Delta will have decreased its transatlantic flights
from 293 a week last summer to 259 - a reduction of 12 per cent.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares fall
sharply as concern mounted about the prospects for its financial rescue
plans after an inconclusive creditors meeting in Paris.
The shares, which have been highly volatile since last autumn when the full
extent of the group's financial problems became apparent, fell by 7.5 per
cent to close FFr2.70 lower at FFr33.50.
The fall was helped by the announcement that Euro Disney fell further into
the red in the quarter to December 31 with a net loss of FFr553m (Dollars
93.09m) against FFr423m in the same period of 1992.
Euro Disney's banks had originally hoped to use the meeting as a forum to
finalise plans for their strategy in the rescue talks.
But KPMG Peat Marwick, their auditor, was unable to complete its financial
analysis in time. The banks now plan to meet later this month when KPMG has
completed its report.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Airlines, the Texas-based carrier that emerged from its second
bankruptcy in April last year, yesterday reported an operating profit of
Dollars 8.5m for the fourth quarter, compared with operating losses of
Dollars 43.7m in the comparable 1992 period.
Its net losses, however, rose from Dollars 13.9m last time to Dollars 26.5m,
or Dollars 1.47 a share, but Continental said the comparable period's
results were favourably affected by Dollars 62m worth of non-recurring
adjustments mainly related to litigation settlements.
For the eight months from its reorganisation to the end of 1993, it reported
net losses of Dollars 38.5m, or Dollars 2.33 a share. No meaningful
comparison is available for the previous year because the company was in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Mr Robert Ferguson, chairman and chief executive, said the fourth quarter's
results were evidence of the company's continuing progress with cost
reductions and improved marketing.
Earlier this week Continental put further downward pressure on US air fares
by announcing it was increasing the number of cut-price flights it offers
each day from 304 to 875, more than half its daily total of 1,599
departures.
The move makes it better able to compete with small, low-cost carriers like
the Texas-based Southwest Airlines, which are transforming the domestic
short-haul market by turning air travel into a no-frills commodity business.
Late yesterday Southwest, the only consistently profitable airline in the
US, reported a surge in net income from Dollars 26.8m last time to Dollars
38.4m for the fourth quarter, lifting earnings per share from 18 cents to 26
cents. For the full year, net income rose by 54 per cent to Dollars 169.5m.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canada ponders a multimedia link
 -Rogers and Maclean Hunter may join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle for supremacy in the fast-changing multimedia business in
Canada has intensified, with Rogers Communications proposing a 'strategic
merger' with Maclean Hunter.
The outcome of what appears to be an unfolding battle for control of MH is
likely to be decided only partly by what is good for each company's
shareholders.
Canadians can also expect to be bombarded over the next few weeks with
opinions about how best to preserve some of their most treasured cultural
icons, ranging from Maclean's, Canadian answer to Time magazine, to a string
of radio and television stations.
Other weighty public policy issues will loom large in what Rogers is billing
as Canada's opportunity to create a company able to stand up to the muscle
of such global multimedia behemoths as Time Warner, News Corporation and
Bertelsmann.
Rogers' proposal is certain to spark a debate about the relative merits of
concentration of ownership versus economies of scale in the media and
cable-TV businesses.
If foreign partners or predators become involved in the fray, as some
analysts predict, Canadians will also be confronted with the vexing question
of foreign involvement in the institutions which help define the differences
between themselves and their southern neighbours.
Rogers is expected to unveil details of its offer following a board meeting
in Toronto this afternoon. It has already bought 8.3 per cent of MH's 210m
shares on the open market.
To finance the cash part of its offer, Rogers has CDollars 700m (USDollars
526.3m) in cash on hand and is arranging credit lines of CDollars 2bn. It
has indicated it will also include a parcel of its own non-voting shares in
the bid.
MH's share price has shot up in anticipation of the offer, boosting its
market capitalisation in the past two days from CDollars 2.85bn to about
CDollars 3.5bn.
MH's US cable-television franchises in New Jersey, Michigan and Florida are
alone estimated to be worth between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn. These
assets could play a decisive role in the looming battle.
Mr Ted Rogers, founder, controlling shareholder and chief executive of the
company which carries his name, says if his bid succeeds, he will sell the
franchises to help pay down debt. However, MH said this week it had hired
Goldman Sachs to explore the possibility of selling the cable-TV assets
itself, 'with the objective of protecting and enhancing shareholder value'.
With an eye on the political ramifications of the deal, Mr Rogers wrapped
himself in a figurative maple leaf when he unveiled his plans late on
Wednesday. The aim of the 'strategic merger', he said, was to create 'a
dynamic new Canadian multimedia company where the whole is obviously far
stronger than the parts'.
The two companies combined have annual revenues of about CDollars 3bn. Their
cable-TV systems cover more than 3m subscribers, and between them own 32
radio stations and a number of TV outlets.
MH publishes about 250 magazines and trade journals, and owns 62 per cent of
the Toronto Sun.
Mr Rogers claimed a merger between Rogers and MH would act as a
counterweight to Canada's powerful telephone companies, as the lines between
communications, media and entertainment become increasingly blurred.
He already has a minority stake in Unitel, which is trying to break the
established phone companies' iron grip on the long-distance market.
Mr Rogers held out the prospect of lower cable-TV fees as the two companies
combined and rationalised their Canadian operations. Their cable systems
make up more than a third of the total market, and several are contiguous.
MH has so far reacted with typical caution to the approaches. It has noted
that numerous regulatory approvals will be required. Its board 'will
consider the proposal in light of its other strategic alternatives, and with
a view to the best interests of MH and its shareholders'.
The question is already being raised as to whether a rock-solid repository
of Canadian culture like Maclean Hunter should be allowed to fall into the
hands of a restless entrepreneur like Mr Ted Rogers.
A columnist wrote in yesterday's Globe &amp; Mail newspaper: 'It is hard to see
what highly-indebted Rogers is bringing to the table - aside from yet
another bridging loan from its patient bankers. Why could not Maclean Hunter
reshape its own future, or turn around and swallow Mr Rogers whole?'

EMC, the fast growing US manufacturer of computer data storage and retrieval
systems, reported a 331 per cent jump in earnings for 1993 as sales far
exceeded expectations.
EMC's products include data storage systems for use with IBM mainframe and
mid-range computers as well as Unisys mainframes.
For the year, the company reported revenues of Dollars 783m, an increase of
103 per cent over 1992's Dollars 386m. Net income for the year rose to
Dollars 127m, or 60 cents a share, compared with Dollars 29.5m, or 16 cents
a share, in 1992.
Fourth-quarter revenues more than doubled to Dollars 248.6m from Dollars
117.8m while net income was Dollars 46.8m, or 21 cents a share, up from
Dollars 10.4m, or 6 cents, in the same period a year ago.
EMC is a leader in the emerging disk array market, for data storage systems
based upon a collection of small disk drives, like those used in personal
computers. Disk arrays provide faster data retrieval as well as higher
storage capacity than conventional data storage systems at a lower price.
EMC gained market share in 1993 and expects to continue to do so this year,
said Mr Michael Ruettgers, president and chief executive.
EMC is planning to launch new very high capacity data storage products this
year that will address a broader segment of the data storage market, added
Mr Bob Ano, senior vice-president of marketing.
In particular, the company expects growing demand for high capacity storage
systems for multimedia and information highway applications, such as
interactive television.

Whirlpool profits 11%

<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the leading US maker of white goods, yesterday announced an 11
per cent increase in fourth-quarter net earnings, helped by higher unit
shipments in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia.
The group made Dollars 69m, or 94 cents a share, up from Dollars 62m, or 87
cents, in the same period of last year, while revenues rose 4 per cent to
Dollars 1.90bn, despite the negative effect of currency translation.
The figures included Dollars 14m, or 19 cents, in after-tax charges for
restructuring in Canada and Europe and for ending agreements with
distributors in the US. The 1992 quarter was reduced by an Dollars 11m, or
15 cents a share, special charge.
Whirlpool made Dollars 51m, or 67 cents, in 1993 as a whole, down from
Dollars 205m, or Dollars 2.90, in 1992, although excluding special charges
earnings would have been 32 per cent up at Dollars 271m.
The company said shipments in its core North American market had grown in
1993 well ahead of the sector's 5 per cent expansion and it expected
regional industry shipments to rise by 3-4 per cent this year. Whirlpool's
North American operating results were up significantly on 1992.
In Europe the group recorded strong shipment growth despite an industry
decline of 1 to 2 per cent. Industry shipments in 1994 were expected to be
similar to last year.
Maytag, the white goods manufacturer, reported fourth quarter income up 55
per cent, from Dollars 11.2m, or 11 cents in 1992, to Dollars 17.5m, or 16
cents. The improvement was due mainly to increased volume, especially in
premium brands, and greater production and operating efficiencies.
However, the Hoover Europe subsidiary lost Dollars 6.9m, against income of
Dollars 4.1m, due to pressure on operating margins and inefficiencies
associated with its consolidation of vacuum cleaner production in Scotland.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Clouds roll in over Silicon
Valley - The microprocessor market faces fierce competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the US semiconductor maker, unveiled some sparkling 1993 financial
results: net income had jumped 115 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn and revenues
had risen 50 per cent to Dollars 8.8bn.
The figures confirmed the Silicon Valley company's position as the world's
largest and most profitable semiconductor manufacturer. But there are some
clouds gathering.
Driving Intel's growth is its domination of the market for microprocessors
that power personal computers. About 80 per cent of the 36m PCs sold last
year contained an Intel microprocessor chip.
Yet recent setbacks have demonstrated the intense competition Intel will
face in the year ahead, raising questions about how long the company can
maintain its grip on the PC microprocessor market.
The latest bad news comes from one of several tangled legal disputes in
which Intel has been attempting to prevent competitors from 'cloning' its
microprocessor chips.
Intel this week dropped patent infringement claims against Cyrix, a small
Texas semiconductor company that has been selling its own versions of
Intel's 486 microprocessor. Intel agreed to settle the dispute, granting
Cyrix patent licences and paying the company Dollars 5m, contingent on an
appeal of one aspect of the case.
While the settlement will enable Cyrix to compete more effectively with
Intel, more importantly, it could open the way for larger chip manufacturers
to compete with Intel.
As part of the settlement, Intel was obliged to provide Cyrix with a list of
semiconductor companies that could manufacture clone microprocessors on
Cyrix' behalf, because they already hold licences to Intel's patents.
These include SGS Thompson's US division and Texas Instruments, as well as
'a short list of other manufacturers'. These companies, if they choose to
partner Cyrix or another clone designer, could pose a far more significant
threat to Intel.
Intel's capitulation in the Cyrix case stems partly from a US Supreme Court
decision last month not to hear an appeal of a similar case in which Intel
was attempting to prevent another small competitor circumventing its patents
by contracting with Hewlett-Packard to manufacture clone microprocessors.
In the meantime, Intel's lawyers have been busy in San Francisco in a
re-trial of the company's technology licensing dispute with Advanced Micro
Devices, a Silicon Valley neighbour and former Intel technology partner.
This case will determine whether AMD can continue to sell microprocessor
chips incorporating Intel technology. If Intel wins, it could stop AMD in
its tracks. But the outcome is far from certain.
AMD is Intel's strongest competitor in the PC microprocessor market. In a
significant blow to Intel, Compaq Computer, the third largest PC
manufacturer after IBM and Apple Computer, last week announced it would buy,
for the first time, some of its microprocessor chips from AMD.
Although Intel is expected to remain Compaq's principal supplier, the shift
represents a strong endorsement for AMD that could influence other PC
manufacturers.
In another development that may in the long term represent a far more
serious threat to Intel, IBM is not taking up its option to manufacture,
under licence, Intel's latest Pentium microprocessors.
Instead, IBM will focus its semiconductor production investments on
'PowerPC' microprocessors, co-developed by IBM with Motorola and Apple
Computer.
IBM's decision confirms it now regards PowerPC as its strategic
microprocessor technology for the future. But it stresses it has a large and
growing business in PCs based on Intel chips, and expects to buy large
quantities from Intel.
Despite Intel's clouded outlook, none of its competitors can match its
resources. This year, for example, it is planning capital expenditures on
new production plants and equipment of Dollars 2.4bn, a 26 per cent increase
over 1993.
The capital injection will enable Intel to deliver new generations of chips
that are smaller, faster, more energy-efficient and less expensive to make
than those produced on older technologies, Mr Andrew Grove, president and
chief executives, told industry analysts last week.
This year, Intel will greatly expand production of its latest Pentium
microprocessors to 'several million units'. Mr Grove said he expected
Pentium processor-based computers to represent 15 per cent of all PCs sold
this year, up from only about 1 per cent in 1993.
'So long as we don't screw up, we will be very hard to catch,' says Mr
Grove.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares fall
sharply as concern mounted about the prospects for its financial rescue
plans after an inconclusive creditors meeting in Paris.
The shares, which have been highly volatile since last autumn when the full
extent of the group's financial problems became apparent, fell by 7.5 per
cent to close FFr2.70 lower at FFr33.50.
The fall was helped by the announcement that Euro Disney fell further into
the red in the quarter to December 31 with a net loss of FFr553m (Dollars
93.09m) against FFr423m in the same period of 1992.
Euro Disney's banks had originally hoped to use the meeting as a forum to
finalise plans for their strategy in the rescue talks.
But KPMG Peat Marwick, their auditor, was unable to complete its financial
analysis in time. The banks now plan to meet later this month when KPMG has
completed its report.
KPMG's preliminary analysis of Euro Disney's position does not differ
greatly from information released to the banks by Walt Disney, its US parent
company.
However, sources said its initial estimates suggest that the group may need
a capital injection of around FFr12bn to reduce its FFr20.3bn net debt,
slightly more than Walt Disney's suggestion of FFr10bn.

<TEXT>
Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported an 11
per cent increase in net income to Dollars 122.1m in the fourth quarter,
helped by its largest unit volume growth of the year.
Earnings per share rose by 18 per cent to 78 cents with fewer shares in
issue.
Mr Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive, said every operating division
at home and overseas had turned in its best volume performance of the year.
Worldwide unit volume rose by 7 per cent and turn-over by 4 per cent to
Dollars 1.8bn.
The strongest growth came from Colgate's newer markets in Asia, Africa and
Latin America. Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Australia produced combined
volume growth of 17 per cent and Latin America produced volume growth of 11
per cent. Hill's Pet Nutrition increased volume by 9 per cent.
Colgate's mature markets did less well. In North America, volumes declined
by 1 per cent from a strong performance in the comparable quarter, and in
Europe volumes were only 1 per cent ahead - although this was the first
quarter in 1993 to show an increase.
For the full year, unit volume grew by 5 per cent and sales by 2 per cent to
Dollars 7.1bn. Excluding a charge of Dollars 358.2m for accounting changes,
net income advanced by 15 per cent to Dollars 548.1m and earnings per share
by 16 per cent to Dollars 3.38.

<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, recorded faster-than-expected sales growth of
9 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn in the last quarter of 1993 compared with a year
before. But Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring and other charges dragged the
group into loss.
The higher sales were supported by products such as Axid, Humatrope, Prozac
and Vancocin, the company said. Sales of Ceclor, an antibiotic which is
Lilly's second-biggest product after Prozac, the anti-depressant, declined
slightly during the year, it added.
Due to previously announced charges, the company reported a net loss for the
quarter of Dollars 523.6m, or Dollars 1.77 a share. Excluding one-off items,
net income would have risen to Dollars 332.4m, or Dollars 1.14, from Dollars
311.1m, or Dollars 1.06, a year ago, when Lilly took restructuring charges
of Dollars 46.1m pre-tax.
Like other companies, Lilly has experienced a slow-down in the US market.
Sales there last year grew by 4 per cent, held back by 'downward pressure on
prices resulting from Medicaid rebates, which increased to Dollars 156m, and
greater participation in managed care programmes'.
Sales outside the US grew by 6 per cent, taking overall sales up 5 per cent
to Dollars 6.5bn. Pharmaceuticals accounted for Dollars 4.75bn, up 7 per
cent, and medical devices and diagnostics - earmarked for disposal - for
Dollars 1.25bn, up 4 per cent.
For the year as a whole, net income fell to Dollars 480m, or Dollars 1.63,
from Dollars 709m, or Dollars 2.41, in 1992.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: KLM seeks Fl 1bn to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday unveiled plans to raise almost Fl 1bn
(Dollars 510m) through a global offering of about 20m ordinary shares.
The Dutch government, which owns 38.2 per cent of KLM, is to maintain its
holding by participating in the issue and by buying preference shares. It is
estimated that the state would contribute at least Fl 370m.
The issue would help reduce long-term debt of Fl 6.3bn and give the group
scope to invest.
The announcement of the issue, scheduled for March, coincided with news that
the Dutch flag carrier achieved a third-quarter net profit of Fl 15m against
a Fl 437m loss a year ago.
The return to profit in the third quarter, which covers the traditionally
weak months of October-December, is due mainly to the fact that KLM no
longer carries its 20 per cent stake in Northwest Airlines on its book.
In the corresponding period of 1992-93, the Dutch airline took a large
extraordinary charge to write down the remaining book value of its
investment in Wings Holdings, Northwest Airline's parent company.
Its refusal to drop Northwest from its international expansion plans in
favour of Swissair's US partner, Delta, was a prime reason for the failure
of the four-way European airline merger.
The third-quarter improvement also reflects cost-cutting efforts. Salaries
and related expenses fell 7 per cent, due partly to a two-year 'holiday' on
pension premium contributions.
Overall, operating expenses were barely changed at Fl 2.02bn, even though
capacity rose 12 per cent. Revenue grew 7 per cent to Fl 2.1bn. Traffic
growth was 17 per cent but growth in yields was 8 per cent due to
competition and a shift in demand to tourist class.
KLM said it expected a fourth-quarter loss. But it repeated earlier
forecasts of a 'modest' full-year profit.

<TEXT>
Shares in Vard, the loss-making Norwegian cruise ship and ferry operator,
tumbled yesterday as AEA Investors, a US investment company, withdrew its
Dollars 565m bid to acquire two of Vard's cruise lines.
Vard's shares fell 21 per cent to NKr51 in active trading on the Oslo
bourse. On Wednesday they were the second-most traded share when they rose
NKr4.50 to NKr64.50.
The collapse of the AEA deal is the second time Vard has failed to conclude
asset disposals in recent months. AEA and Vard had hoped to complete the
deal by this spring.
AEA said it had decided not to pursue the transaction having concluded that
its investment goals for the two cruise lines could not be achieved within
the financial framework proposed for the transaction.
Proceeds from the disposal would have enabled Vard to lift its position in
the mass cruise market by concentrating financial resources on Norwegian
Cruise Line, its remaining cruise business.
It had planned to strengthen, expand and modernise Norwegian Cruise Line as
well as reduce borrowings and strengthen the line's balance sheet.
Mr Terje Mikalsen, Vard's chairman, said a number of alternatives to the US
deal were being studied.
Analysts said the failure of the deal pushes fleet renewals far into the
future and raises questions over alternative strategies for Vard to
accomplish goals which could have only been made possible by the disposal.
They suggested AEA may have backed out of the deal because of reservations
about the potential of the high-risk cruise industry versus the cost of
participation and the return on investment.
Vard said bookings for the two cruise lines were stronger than in previous
years.
It forecast profits for both cruise lines in the current year.

Voest-Alpine Technologie (VA Tech), engineering group, is to be privatised
on May 16 with a four-day flotation of 51 per cent of the company's capital
on the Vienna stock exchange.
The sale, which the government hopes will raise about Sch5bn (Dollars 416m),
is part of a large Austrian privatisation programme approved in November.
VA Tech is the largest group to be privatised within the former Austrian
Industries (AI) state industrial group which was dissolved in December
following heavy losses.
Analysts expect the flotation of VA Tech, which consists of several
engineering, construction and energy companies, to attract strong
international interest.
The privatisation programme will include the sale of state shareholdings in
OMV, the oil and chemicals group; SGP Verkerstechnik, the railways rolling
stock manufacturer; Austria Mikrosysteme, maker of customised microchip; and
Vamed, a hospital construction group.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Akbank leaps 125% to TL3,700bn

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Akbank, Turkey's largest retail bank, jumped 125 per cent
to TL3,700bn (Dollars 213m) in 1993. The rise mostly reflects the continued
strong performance of the Turkish economy.
Akbank, which is listed on the Istanbul stock exchange, is 60 per cent owned
by Sabanci, Turkey's second-largest family-owned conglomerate. Last year,
it's loan book increased by 80 per cent to TL56,100bn.
The bank was active in consumer lending, a relatively new area which grew by
600 per cent in 1993. Like other Turkish banks, Akbank is expanding rapidly
its consumer business. Akbank's consumer activities are closely linked with
the financing of the parent company's recently launched car manufacturing
venture with Toyota of Japan.
The bank completed a Dollars 100m syndicated loan in 1993, its first foreign
borrowing. However, unlike other Turkish banks, Akbank has refrained from
large foreign borrowings - it funded its lira loan book from deposits. These
grew by 47 per cent to TL32,200bn in 1993 and account for about 90 per cent
of bank funding.
This leaves Akbank less exposed than most of its competitors to the impact
of the recent 12 per cent lira devaluation, and the changes in reserve
requirement introduced by the central bank.
The changes - redefining reserve requirements to reflect a bank's total
liabilities - will be felt more by non-deposit-taking banks, particularly
foreign banks.
The Turkish government's 21 per cent state in Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi
(Tofas), the car assembly group 42 per cent owned by Fiat, will be sold by
private placement with US institutions together with a European issue and a
local Turkish offering.
Shearson Lehman Bros and J Henry Schroder Wagg are advising on the deal
which is expected to raise about Dollars 550m. Tofas is Turkey's largest car
producer with a 45 per cent market share.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: More boardroom upheaval at VW -
The rise and fall of the Audi chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, the soon-to-be-ex-chairman of Audi, had good reason
to be grateful to Mr Ferdinand Piech.
Less than two years ago, Mr Piech, the Volkswagen group chairman, plucked
the 42-year-old from the obscurity of a Mercedes-Benz distribution centre in
Bonn. Mr Kortum was to be Audi marketing director.
Within eight months he was to take Mr Piech's then job at the helm of VW's
quality car subsidiary, while his ambitious protector was to make the great
leap forward to the top of Europe's biggest automotive group.
However, Mr Kortum's gratitude did not extend to his adopting the role of
trained lapdog. Even when he was offered the job of spokesman - a sort of
first among equals on the Audi board - he held out for the higher ranking of
chairman.
In spite of this uneasy start, the inexperienced Bavarian started off by
following his master's voice. Until last summer, he was still claiming Audi
would break even in 1993 in spite of a DM198m (Dollars 116.4m) first-half
loss.
He was only echoing Mr Piech's own forecasts for the group. But by the end
of the holidays, he realised a level result was out of sight.
Internal business forecasts suggested car deliveries would fall during 1993
to 364,000 compared with 472,000 in Mr Piech's last year. In the event, the
predictions proved spot on. Audi has recently reported a 24 per cent drop in
sales for last year to 360,000, and a 30 per cent cut in production. Both
figures are worse than at BMW and Mercedes.
At the Frankfurt motor show last September, he omitted a reference to
breaking even from the text of a speech previously vetted by VW group. Two
months later, he was publicly blaming Mr Piech and the previous board for an
expected but unspecified loss.
Audi's distribution lacked punch, he said.
'This weakness is an important reason why Audi is in a worse position than
others. Clear failings in the past have to be corrected,' he said. Audi's
domestic rivals had a 20-year lead.
Like others, Mr Kortum had fallen foul of the worst motor industry downturn
in post-war history. But he had other burdens. As he was to discover, record
volume sales for 1992 had been bolstered by an old trick.
Audi France officials confirmed yesterday that 'several tens of thousands'
of cars had been parked with French distributors, only to be shipped back to
Germany last year. Since many of them lacked airbags and ABS braking systems
 -regarded as essentials in the Germany quality car market - selling them
was no easy task.
Mr Kortum had to contend with Mr Piech's persistent demands that his
brainchild, a revolutionary aluminium-bodied car, should be brought to
market this spring. According to industry sources, manufacturing
difficulties have forced delays.
In the end, it was all too much for the mild young salesman.
Like his colleagues at Seat in Spain, he had been instructed by headquarters
to prepare a business plan which would yield a balanced result for the full
year. But as he and Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat chairman, were to
discover, the numbers would not bend sufficiently.
Mr Diaz, recently accused of deception by Mr Piech, was fired last September
after an 'unexpected' loss of DM1.25bn came to light. Now it is Mr Kortum's
turn in the revolving door, raising once again the question: who's next?

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Armani takes control of Simint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion designer, has become the biggest
shareholder in the troubled Simint clothing group after buying out a close
business associate.
Mr Armani and his sister Rosanna are together buying the 21.71 per cent
stake held by Finarte, the auction group controlled by Mr Francesco Micheli,
a Milan financier.
Milan analysts said the stake was being divided between Mr Armani, who
already holds about 20 per cent of the quoted Simint group, and his sister,
to avoid triggering a compulsory takeover bid.
The Simint saga illustrates the risks and rewards of investing in the
fashion world. Mr Micheli, who took control of Simint in the late 1980s,
helped steer a strong recovery under new management.
Earnings rose steadily and, in 1992, Simint even joined the select group of
Italian companies to issue American depository receipts on Wall Street.
Since then, the story has been less positive. Simint, which specialises in
producing clothing under licence for well-known designers, has been affected
by high debts and stagnant demand in the recession-hit clothing market.
It has been particularly affected by the 1991 decision to join forces with
Mr Armani in developing a relatively low-priced store chain in the US.
Although the shops, named Armani Exchange (A/X) share the designer's name
and sell exclusively Armani-labelled wares, Simint bore the development
costs.
Heavy investment spending in the US venture has largely accounted for the
sharp reversal in recent performance. Net profits for the year ended April
1993 fell to L1.6bn (Dollars 946,000) from L17.5bn. For the first half of
this year, the group reported a L12.8bn loss against pre-tax profits of
L6.6bn.
Mr Micheli justified his decision to sell out on the grounds that Simint's
US venture had become too risky.

FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paribas confirms upturn with
estimated 58% gain
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paribas, one of France's leading banking groups, continued its recovery last
year with a 58 per cent increase in estimated net profits to FFr1.4bn
(Dollars 237.2m) from FFr886m in 1992.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said the group had benefited from a very good
performance in market trading, where it made strong gains during this
summer's European currency crisis. It fared well in its North American and
Asian banking activities.
He forecast another profit increase this year saying that Paribas, which has
been recovering from its poor performance in 1991 when it made its first
loss, 'should be able to continue the improvement in its results during
1994'.
However, the group's shares yesterday fell by FFr8 to FFr581 following
Wednesday's rise of FFr26 to FFr589 on speculation that Paribas was about to
announce the sale of part of its stake in Navigation Mixte, the industrial
group with which it has a cross-shareholding agreement.
Mr Levy-Lang yesterday sought to squash the rumours by stating that Paribas
had no plans to reduce its stake in Navigation Mixte. He said it had raised
FFr1.5bn by selling 12 per cent of Poliet, the building materials concern,
and FFr1bn from the sale of 5 per cent of Ciments Francais, the cement
company.
Paribas estimated that its total operating income rose to FFr33.3bn in 1993
from FFr29bn with gross operating income rising to FFr13.5bn from FFr11.3bn.
However, it was forced to make FFr9.2bn of new net provisions against
FFr7.7bn in 1992 partly due to the problems of the French property market.
Mr Levy-Lang said that commercial property was still depressed, but the
situation was improving in residential property.
Paribas is the first of the big French banks to publish estimated results
for 1993. The announcement coincided with a one-day strike by banking
workers in protest against lack of consultation on job losses and government
plans for longer opening hours.
Meanwhile, the government is in the throes of negotiating a complex
recapitalisation package worth between FFr3bn and FFr4bn for Credit
Lyonnais, another big bank, in preparation for its privatisation.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Creston acquires property portfolio for
Pounds 3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Creston Land &amp; Estates, the property concern, has agreed to acquire a
portfolio of property for Pounds 3.4m from TR Property Investment Trust.
The consideration is to be satisfied by the issue of 8.66m new shares, a
Pounds 1.5m placing of loan stock and Pounds 1.07m in cash. One TR
subsidiary will subscribe in cash for 4m new shares and Pounds 475,265 of
loan stock, while the remaining Pounds 1.03m of loan stock will go to other
TR subsidiaries.
The loan stock will carry a coupon of 6 per cent and will be convertible
into shares at 17 1/2 p each.
As well as the loan stock issue directors also propose to raise Pounds 1.5m,
before expenses, by way of a rights issue of 10m shares at 15p each. These
will be allotted on the basis of 13 for every 79 shares and/or warrants
held.
Directors pointed out that the current net rental income from the properties
to be acquired - in Stevenage, Gillingham and Edgware - totals some Pounds
380,000 a year.
Progress on letting vacant areas is being made at both Telford and Clydebank
and recent investments in new plant and machinery should assist in achieving
'improved operating results.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Adding some fizz to its investments - An
in-depth look at the aims and aspirations of Rutland Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interests in sticky labels and fizzy drinks make Rutland Trust, now listed
under Other Financial, difficult to classify.
Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, believes the sale of part of Ben Shaws,
its Yorkshire soft drinks company, to Canada's Cott Corporation is a classic
illustration of what Rutland is aiming to do. However, events have moved
much faster than expected.
It was only last August when Rutland paid Pounds 5.7m for 84 per cent of Ben
Shaws, an old family company that had overstretched itself. Under the deal,
announced on Monday, Cott is paying an initial Pounds 6m for 51 per cent of
the Ben Shaws Pontefract canning line operation, the UK's largest
independent canning line.
The other half of the Ben Shaws business in Huddersfield, which concentrates
on the local returnable soft drinks market and spring water production, will
continue to be developed by Rutland. It has just won an order from J
Sainsbury for own-label water.
The rapid sale of part of Ben Shaws is in direct contrast to Rutland's
cautious approach before buying the business. It was talking with Ben Shaws
from the end of 1992 before finally making the acquisition.
'We have a very long gestation period,' says Mr Langdon at the company's
Knightsbridge headquarters.
Rutland never buys 100 per cent of a company - but never less than 75 per
cent. This allows the former management to have a share of the company,
giving them an incentive to perform well.
'It's a partnership. We keep the distinction between operating management
and financial and strategic management.'
Since August, Rutland has been implementing new financial and operational
controls at Ben Shaws. The group insists on strict financial reporting,
demanding a full management report five working days after the end of each
month.
The group has also made good use of Mr Langdon's supermarket group contacts,
winning orders for canned drinks from J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway.
In spite of the short time scale, several companies had already offered to
buy Ben Shaws before Cott came on the scene, according to Mr Langdon.
But Rutland's aim is always to add value to an acquisition, and a straight
sale was not on the cards. The deal with Cott fits neatly with that aim.
Rutland will continue to own 49 per cent of the canning line, which had a
turnover of Pounds 40m for the 11 months to end-December, for a year. Then
Cott has the right to buy a further 31.5 per cent for a minimum of Pounds 5m
and a maximum of Pounds 7.5m, depending on 1994 earnings. Rutland will
retain 17.5 per cent.
Cott can add value where Rutland cannot, says Mr Langdon, who is chairman of
Ben Shaws and will be joining the board of Cott in the UK. Its expertise is
in recipes, marketing and branding skills, and it will set up a management
team of soft drink experts that can develop it faster and quicker than
Rutland could on its own.
In North America, Cott has sprung from nowhere to create what it terms a
'retailer branded beverage business.' It supplies supermarket chains such as
Wal-Mart with own-label colas. Profits at the nine-month stage to
end-October last year were more than doubled to CDollars 26.2m (Pounds
13.2m) on turnover also more than doubled at CDollars 502m.
Last week Cott entered the European market through a five-year agreement
with Cadbury Schweppes under which Cadbury bottling plants will produce
drinks for a newly-formed Cott arm in Europe.
Mr Simon Lester, president of Cott Europe, said Ben Shaws had proved the
ideal candidate for his company's plans to enter the UK market. It would
keep the existing business, generating 500m cans a year, and start to
develop branded colas for UK retailers. The line has capacity to produce an
additional 500m cans a year.
Rutland has been so closely involved with Ben Shaws partly because Capital
Industries, its 43 per cent owned industrial associate, had its hands full
with Samuel Jones, the sticky label manufacturer acquired with Rutland's
support in 1992.
Last November Capital downgraded its profits forecast following trouble with
some new machinery at Samuel Jones, now solved. Nevertheless, the
acquisition of Samuel Jones has transformed Capital, which was spun off in
1991 at Pounds 10m. It now has a market capitalisation of Pounds 43m, giving
Rutland an unrealised profit of about Pounds 10m.
Rutland was formed when Mr Langdon left Price Waterhouse in 1986, and has
since grown to a market capitalisation of Pounds 70m.
It will continue to concentrate on its financial and business services,
including Ellis &amp; Buckle, 90 per cent-owned and now the UK's fourth biggest
loss adjuster, and Hunter &amp; Partners, a 77 per cent-owned architectural and
building surveying practice.
At the halfway stage last year, pre-tax profits edged ahead from Pounds 3.5m
to Pounds 3.6m, held back by Leasecontracts, the asset financing division
which is involved in vehicle contract hire.
The City is looking for about Pounds 7.5m pre-tax for the year to December,
and was looking for just over Pounds 9m this year before news of the Ben
Shaws disposal.
Some market observers see Rutland as a hybrid, with no clear focus. 'The
question has to be asked if it would not work better as a private company,'
one analyst said.
But Mr Langdon, who describes himself and his right hand man, Mr Christopher
Dowling, as 'boring prudent accountants', is quite clear on the group's
aims.
'When someone says to me: What is the core of Rutland Trust? I say we are
hands on investors in businesses where we can see that we can add a value.
'But if someone is willing to pay more for a company than we think it's
worth to us, and the management is in agreement, then we will sell it,' he
explains.
He points out that the group sees many companies through its corporate
finance division. 'If we can add no value we work for a fee like any
corporate finance house.'
'Ultimately our long-term aspiration is to maximise over periods of time the
value of Rutland itself.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Coda heads for market with Pounds 62m price
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coda is coming to the main market through a placing at 235p a share, valuing
the North Yorkshire-based computer software company at Pounds 61.7m.
US investors are taking a strong interest in the company, which derived
almost half of its Pounds 23.5m revenues last year from the North American
market.
SG Warburg Securities, which is handling the placing, said there would be
26.24m shares in issue following the placing - 8.2m were being placed on
behalf of existing shareholders and 2.45m on behalf of Coda.
Dealings are expected to start on February 9.
General Atlantic Partners, a US private investment group which specialises
in the computing services industry, is spending Pounds 6.16m to acquire 10
per cent of the shares. A further 250,000 shares have been reserved for
placement with institutional investors in the US.
The p/e is 24.5 at the placing price, with a gross dividend yield of 1.1 per
cent.
The net amount raised, after expenses, will be Pounds 5m which Coda intends
to use to develop further its range of international accounting software and
to expand geographically.
Competitors include SAP, the fast-growing German company, which this week
reported a 15 per cent surge in net profits for 1993, indic-ating a buoyant
market for large scale accountancy software.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Try shares slip after trading statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Try Group, the contractor and housebuilder, yesterday fell 2p to
34p, after the company issued a trading statement warning of a break-even
position at the operating level, exceptional charges of over Pounds 1m and
no final dividend.
The statement was made in response to a sharp rise in the share price, which
yesterday reached as high as 41p. At the beginning of the year, Try's shares
stood at 28p.
The group's full-year results are due in mid-March. In 1992, pre-tax profits
grew 43 per cent to Pounds 1.38m, while net attributable losses came out at
Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 3m) after provisions of Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 3.23m) in
respect of a move out of commercial and industrial property.
Try said yesterday that its contracting and plant hire operations had traded
profitably in the year, but 'continued recessionary influences' had resulted
in a further loss from housebuilding.
Certain actions had been taken to improve future profitability, which had
resulted in exceptional charges.
First, the group had secured its release - at a cost of Pounds 750,000  -
from a rental guarantee relating to a property sold in 1990, which would
otherwise have resulted in a continuing operating charge of about Pounds
300,000 a year. In addition, Try had incurred a restructuring charge of some
Pounds 300,000 in respect of further rationalisation.
Explaining its decision to omit the dividend, Try said that it had deemed it
appropriate to recognise the accumulated deficit in its housebuilding
division on the parent company balance sheet.
The effect of this adjustment will be to eliminate the distributable
reserves of the parent company and as a result, no final will be paid.
Last year, the total dividend was cut from 6p to 1p with a 0.5p final. At
the interim stage in September, the payment was held at 0.5p, although
pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 68,000.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: GM Firth halves deficit and calls for
Pounds 3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GM Firth (Holdings), the steel group, halved its losses to Pounds 756,000
pre-tax for the half year to end-September.
Some Pounds 349,000 of the deficit related to exceptional provisions and
Pounds 48,000 to discontinued activities.
The group's future is largely dependent on a sustained return to profit by
Spartan Redheugh, its steelmaking subsidiary. However, trading during the
period had been difficult with steel markets remaining relatively depressed.
Turnover of continuing operations fell from Pounds 9.47m to Pounds 6.48m.
Losses per share emerged at 2.29p (4.46p).
In order to finance additional working capital and reduce debt the group is
calling for Pounds 3.6m via an underwritten rights issue of 33m new shares
on a 1-for-1 basis at 12p. Bank borrowings currently stand at Pounds 5.6m
and revised banking facilities have been agreed.
On receipt of the issue proceeds, Mr Michael Wilkinson, chairman and chief
executive, and Mr Howard Wilkinson and Mr Dennis Hill will retire as
directors.
The terms of their retirement provide for the placing at 12p each of 1m of
the 7m ordinary shares currently held by Wilkinson Holdings, the placing of
all 7.5m of Wilkinson Holdings' and Mr Howard Wilkinson's rights to new
ordinary shares without consideration and the issue of warrants to Wilkinson
Holdings and Mr Howard Wilkinson.
Following the management changes, Sir Alan Thomas will become executive
chairman of Firth and 600,000 of Wilkinson Holdings' rights to new ordinary
shares will be placed with Bedworth, a company wholly owned by the Sir Alan
Thomas Trust.
The trust will also have the option to subscribe for up to 9.45m ordinary
shares at 10p per share which, if exercised in full and added together with
the 600,000 new shares, would give the trust a 12.69 per cent interest in
Firth.
Firth shares closed 5 1/2 p higher at 28 1/2p.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Texan with mission to sell oil prospects to
cynics - A US company seeking Pounds 18m through a listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eugene Fiedorek is either a masochist or a missionary. In each of his
encounters with institutional investors in recent weeks, he and his
colleagues have faced a barrage of hostile questions over their motives for
floating a US-based company in the UK. Yet he still comes back for more.
Mr Fiedorek, a silver-haired 62-year-old Texan, is the man behind Energy
Capital Investment Company, which is raising an estimated Pounds 18m through
an institutional placing.
The company, designed to be wound up in eight years if shareholders approve,
has been set up to meet the demand for financing of smaller independent oil
and gas producers in the US.
The argument is that smaller producers are missing out on a Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 6.6bn) bonanza as the leading oil companies abandon uneconomic
production in the US.
Smaller operators, with their lower overheads and greater flexibility, are
better placed to squeeze production out of the properties.
However, banks will rarely lend more than 65 per cent of the value of proven
producing reserves, leaving the operator unable to exploit the potential of
proven but undeveloped reserves.
Since 1988, Mr Fiedorek and four colleagues - all former executives of the
RepublicBank in Texas - have been providing debt and equity finance for the
oil and gas sector through EnCap, their US fund management vehicle. They
boast a track record of assisted financings totalling Dollars 1.6bn.
However, so far they have managed to raise the funds directly from
investors, without recourse to a public market.
The decision to go after a listing in the UK - to broaden the investor base,
according to EnCap - has been greeted with some trepidation by gun-shy
institutions. Many have had their fingers burned by the raft of small
US-based explorers, floated during the so-called gas bubble of the
mid-1980s, which never lived up to expectations.
ECIC and its advisers argue that such concern is misplaced in this case.
Flotation, they say, is the appropriate route, given the UK investment
climate.
The partnership method employed by EnCap with US investors is not attractive
to UK institutions who would have to file tax returns in two countries.
Partnerships are also exempt from tax in the US and not here. Finally,
investors such as insurance companies would have to write off the total
value of investments in non-quoted vehicles.
Mr Fiedorek is not perturbed by the cynics, even though ECIC has had to look
abroad for about half the funds needed in the absence of a rush from UK
investors.
He insists that ECIC has a welter of checks which will help to balance the
risk of investing in oil and gas.
First, ECIC has sought to bolster its nine-strong board with names such as
Sir Peter Cazalet, former deputy chairman of British Petroleum and Mr Peter
Tudball, chairman of the Baltic Exchange.
The company also intends to avoid exploration and fund only those projects
supported by proven, although possibly undeveloped, reserves.
Financing will be through debt, equity or a combination of both, and each
project will have to offer a pre-tax return of 20 per cent, ECIC says.
Repayment of the earliest investments will also allow ECIC to recycle some
of the funds into new projects. Independent surveys will be made of proposed
investments by institutionally approved engineers.
All investments will also be made alongside a Dollars 30.5m partnership in
the US, which includes Lincoln National LIfe Insurance, one of the largest
life companies in the US, and EnCap.
The projects will be presented to ECIC by EnCap, which will monitor each
investment on a quarterly basis. In return EnCap will receive an annual
management fee equal to 1 per cent of the company's net asset value. At the
end of the company's life, or in 2001, EnCap will be entitled to 25 per cent
of the increase in the net asset value, after allowing for an 8 per cent
annual rate of return.
Management fees totalling 0.8 per cent of net asset value will also be
payable to ECIC's sponsors, the US corporate finance boutique, Rauscher
Pierce &amp; Clark, and its corporate manager Abtrust, a subsidiary of Aberdeen
Trust.
While some observers have suggested that the number of parties benefiting
from the fee structure may be somewhat high, 'if they can fulfil their
promises . . . who says they shouldn't get paid?' said one analyst.
At the end of the day, even ECIC with all of its checks and balances cannot
escape the speculative nature of oil and gas investment.
The prospectus is expected to detail a number of dangers, from government
regulation and price volatility to simply drilling a dry hole. There is also
the significant currency risk to UK investors.
'The risk profile of oil and gas suggests to me that they cannot get all the
investments right,' said one cautious analyst in London. 'It means the ones
they do get right will have to go even better to fulfil their promises to
investors.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: RJB Mining pays Pounds 4.7m for ICI arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining yesterday pleased the market by announcing the Pounds 4.7m
acquisition of a coke and chemical company from Imperial Chemical
Industries. It also forecast pre-tax profits for 1993 of Pounds 12.2m, ahead
of analysts' expectations.
The shares rose 15p to 390p.
RJB is placing and offering 4.1m shares, representing 10 per cent of the
existing total, at 340p to finance the acquisition and raise Pounds 9.3m.
BZW has placed 2.09m shares firm with investors and the balance is placed on
a conditional basis, subject to clawback from shareholders under the open
offer on a 1-for-10 basis.
Some Pounds 3m of the proceeds will be used to develop the Clipstone
colliery in Nottinghamshire, recently leased from British Coal. The
remainder will be used to provide working capital and reduce gearing to
about 40 per cent, against 65 per cent at December 31 1993.
Separately, British Coal announced that it expected to reach lease and
licence arrangements with RJB for the Rossington pit in Yorkshire. It
indicated that Coal Investments was the preferred candidate for Markham Main
pit, another colliery which RJB had hoped to mine.
The acquisition of Monckton Coke and Chemical provides RJB with a market for
Clipstone and its other pits. Monckton processes 300,000 tonnes of coal a
year, mainly to manufacture coke and smokeless fuel for industrial and
household markets.
RJB expects Clipstone to produce 300,000 tonnes this year and up to 500,000
annually thereafter.
Monckton is based near Barnsley, Yorkshire, and employs 190 people. The core
management team will be retained. It made trading profits of about Pounds
423,000 last year, on turnover of about Pounds 17.5m.
Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, said yesterday he was confident that
profit levels of more than Pounds 1m could be achieved at Monckton.
Production inefficiencies would be reduced through the supply of coal from
Clipstone.
RJB's estimate for 1993 pre-tax profits is 10 per cent up on the previous
year's Pounds 11m. Pro forma earnings per share are expected to be 22.7p,
with a final dividend of 7p, making 12p for the full year.
ICI's disposal was prompted by the company's restructuring. ICI Chemicals
and Polymers previously made significant purchases from Monckton for its
soda ash operations, but these were divested in 1991.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Further disposals foreseen this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI's sale of its last coke business yesterday is only the latest disposal
in a series that has been running for several years and promises to continue
through 1994.
The company is in the process of concentrating on fewer businesses. It wants
to be active only in areas where it is a world leader and has global
markets.
This leaves a number of activities for which it is either negotiating a sale
or looking for a buyer. They include:
Polypropylene, which BASF of Germany is negotiating to buy. With annual
sales of more than Pounds 100m, ICI could be hoping for something
approaching that sum in payment. But the sector is dogged by overcapacity
and talks with BASF have dragged on for a year. This week the German company
said the talks were now in their 'final stage'.
Polypropylene film is a slightly smaller business that turns the raw plastic
into the likes of crisp packets and cigarette packet wrapping. Without the
polypropylene business to supply it, it could be a candidate for disposal.
Fertilisers, part of chemicals and polymers, could not be sold to Kemira,
the Finnish state-owned company, in 1991 when the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission judged that, among other things, the sale was tantamount to
nationalisation. The business has since shrunk as it has been buffeted by
falling demand from European farmers conforming to Community Agricultural
Policy. The Indian fertiliser business was sold last month for about Pounds
25m.
Advanced materials is also a non-core business, and most of it has been sold
or closed. What remains is the Arizona-based Fiberite which supplies parts
to the US aerospace industry. Disposal talks were revealed last year,
although no buyer was named.
Petrochemicals was, a decade ago, the company's biggest single division. Now
it is focused on just a handful of activities of which non-core areas
include production of ethylene and its derivatives.
ICI Australia, 63 per cent owned by the parent company, has ploughed an
independent furrow for many years. The result is that the shape of the
business is very different from that controlled from the UK. Last year a
reorganisation put the whole of ICI's Asian businesses under Australian
command and the pressure is on to clarify which industrial strategy it is
following.
ICI confirmed yesterday that a string of disposals was planned for later
this year, although it declined to specify which businesses would go.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern acquires Reject Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reject Shop, the USM-quoted furniture and household goods retailer which has
suffered mounting losses through the recession, is to be acquired for Pounds
2.5m by Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the Middlesbrough-based department store
group revitalised by new management.
Mr Jeffrey Gould, Upton's chief executive, said Reject Shop, heavily focused
on south-east England and the recession-prone 18-35 year old first time
housebuyer, had erred by trying to move upmarket.
Upton planned to reduce prices and rationalise the product range, turning
Reject Shop into a town centre rival to Ikea. 'The idea is to be very
competitive,' he said.
The enlarged group will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 13m,
annual turnover of Pounds 35m and 36 stores, including the 31-store Reject
Shop chain. Upton's value before the purchase was Pounds 5.37m. Reject Shop
will be Upton's core business.
The offer consists of three 5p Upton shares for every five Reject Shop
shares valuing them at 22.4p, a discount of about 60 per cent on Wednesday's
close. There is a partial cash alternative.
In addition, four Upton shares are offered for every three Reject Shop
Pounds 1 preference shares, valuing them at 49.7p for a total of about
Pounds 179,000. Reject Shop's ordinary shares lost 21p to close at 38p,
while Upton rose 1p to 6p.
Upton has received irrevocable undertakings from holders of 83.1 per cent of
the ordinary shares and 92.5 per cent of the preference. Most of these
shares are held by Reject's founders and co-chairmen, Mr Anthony Hawser and
his ex-wife, Mrs Anna Vinton.
To fund the buy Upton is raising a net Pounds 4.5m through a 4-for-30 rights
issue of up to 17.3m 5p shares at 30p each. There is also a share
consolidation of 10 0.5p shares into one 5p share. The issue is underwritten
by Townsley &amp; Co.
Founded in 1973, Reject Shop initially sold seconds, but later moved into
discounted perfect stock. The name will be retained, at least initially,
although one London store will become a renamed pilot unit.
Mr Gould said Reject Shop was top heavy in management. A hard view would be
taken of the business's costs. Upton has been looking at Reject since July
but it had been a struggle to complete the deal. 'The level of price we have
agreed in my opinion reflects the value of the business. In their opinion it
doesn't'
Mr Jim Hodkinson, the former international development director at
Kingfisher and former B&amp;Q deputy chairman and chief executive, will remain
Upton's chairman. Mrs Vinton has been offered a non-executive directorship,
and Mr Geoffrey Frost, Reject's managing director, will become executive
director. Mr Ian Steven, at present a non-executive director of Upton, will
become finance director.
Mr Hawser will no longer be involved in the business he built into a
national name. 'It's a sadness and an opportunity,' he said. He had been
impressed by Mr Gould and thought he would do a good job. He will now pursue
his boat building interests. 'I don't see myself competing with Jeffrey and
Ian, they would eat me alive.'
Reject Shop's results for the 28 weeks to October 3, announced yesterday,
showed a higher pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 884,000) on turnover of
Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9.13m).
Losses per share were 17.29p (6.01p) and the interim dividend is passed
after a payment of 0.5p last time.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Ryan Group
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ryan Group, one of Britain's largest private mining companies, yesterday
said it was calling in the receivers at its Belgian subsidiary following a
bitter dispute with its main customer.
The group claimed that Ryan Europe had been forced out of business by
Electrabel, the national power company which last October cut the price it
paid for coal by 30 per cent.
Earlier this week, anger at the company's imminent collapse spilled over at
its Charleroi plant when workers barricaded three managers and a company
lawyer in their offices, preventing them from attending a receivership court
hearing.
Up to half the 75-strong workforce are thought to have taken part in the
action, during which they warned that the executives would not be released
until their January wages were paid.
The confrontation was defused last night when the company gave assurances
that all salaried staff would receive outstanding wage cheques.
Mr David Peek, group finance director, said the managers would today attend
a court hearing to ask for a receiver to be appointed.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: UBS quits as broker to Proteus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UBS has resigned as joint broker to Proteus International, the
computer-aided drug designer, after disagreements over the speed with which
its products could reach the market.
UBS, which was appointed in October, believed Proteus was being too
optimistic about the time required to complete clinical trials and obtain
regulatory approval.
Proteus shares lost 31p to 394p yesterday, for a fall of 61p in the past
week.
Proteus appointed UBS in the hope of widening its institutional shareholder
base before the end of this year, when it will need to raise more money. But
Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, denied that UBS's resignation was a
serious blow to its funding plans.
Allied Provincial, which floated Proteus at 87p a share in 1990, will
continue as its broker and financial adviser.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lower provisions leave Britannia BS at
Pounds 81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in provisions for bad debts by Britannia Building Society, the UK's
ninth largest society, was behind a 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 66.7m to Pounds 80.8m for the year to end-December. Capital and
interest provisions were cut from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 57.3m.
Profits from Britannia Life, the life assurance and investment subsidiary,
rose by only Pounds 700 000 to Pounds 15.1m, despite the increase in sales
of investment products, such as unit trusts, in the market generally.
Mr John Heaps, chief executive, said the strong performance showed that it
could operate effectively despite the limited signs of improvement in the
housing market.
Its performance on arrears and possessions had shown a marked improvement,
he added, and the situation could be expected to improve further with low
interest rates and stable house prices.
He highlighted Britannia's strategy of widening its distribution channels,
following a programme of some branch closures and head office redundancies
in 1992.
Mr Heaps said that the size of Britannia Life's profits had been affected by
actuarial calculations taking into account factors such as a fall in
long-term interest rates and a discount based on the mix of people in the
life fund.
Group assets at December 31 were Pounds 12.9bn (Pounds 10.4bn) and retail
balances rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 7.3bn (Pounds 6.9bn).
Total mortgage lending rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Administrative costs remained steady, and the cost to income ratio, fell to
45.9 per cent (47.1 per cent).

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: S&amp;N picks Germany for next Center Parcs
village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, yesterday confirmed
that Center Parcs, its rapidly-expanding leisure specialist company, is to
build its first complex in Germany.
The Pounds 80m village in Bispingen, south of Hamburg, will be operational
next year.
It will be the company's 15th domed holiday complex and will cater for
300,000 visitors a year. The third UK Center Parcs site at Longleat in
Wiltshire opens this summer.
S&amp;N acquired Center Parcs from its Dutch owners in 1989 and it quickly
became the group's star performer. Last year, it continued to defy the
continental recession with more than 3m visitors to its year-round sites in
the Netherlands, Belgium, UK and France. Occupancy rates were more than 90
per cent.
S&amp;N's leisure division, the bulk of whose business is accounted for by
Center Parcs, raised operating profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 42.4m in the
six months to end-October. Turnover was also 9 per cent higher at Pounds
185.3m.
Mr Jim Merrington, S&amp;N's director of corporate affairs, said last year more
than 400,000 German holidaymakers visited Center Parcs throughout Europe.
S&amp;N is expected to build a second German site in the next few years.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Utd Newspapers expands in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday
acquired a Hong Kong trade fair group as part of its strategy of expanding
in east Asia.
Earlier this week United announced a further push into the US advertising
periodicals business with the Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) acquisition of
Harmon Publishing Company.
United is paying an initial Dollars 35m cash for Hong Kong International
Trade Fair Group. A further Dollars 9m is payable if exhibition income beats
certain targets this year and in 1995.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United, said the industrial logic of
the deal was very strong. The group, the third biggest exhibition organiser
in the US, would be moving into the heart of the growing Asean market.
United also announced that it had acquired the 58 per cent of shares in
Asian Business Press that it did not already own. It has held a 42 per cent
stake since 1974.
Mr Wilson said the two businesses would work closely together to exploit
joint opportunities in the region. United as a group would put increasing
emphasis 'on developing titles and activities in markets which have a
worldwide reach.'
HKITF owns seven exhibitions serving the leather, shipping, cosmetics,
tanker and cruise markets. In the year to end-December it made pre-tax
profits of Dollars 2.74m on revenues of Dollars 9.78m.
No figure has been given for the purchase of ABP shares, although Mr Wilson
said it was less than a quarter of the price paid for HKTIF.
ABP publishes controlled circulation business magazines in the travel,
aerospace, computing and broadcasting markets, as well as tourist guides.
Last year when it launched a Pounds 190m cash call, United said that several
opportunities for expanding existing publishing and exhibition interests
were being 'actively pursued in the US and Far East'.

FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cluff shares up 25% on Ghana mine finance
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Cluff Resources rose 25 per cent to 50 1/2 p yesterday after the
London-based company announced that it had arranged finance for a gold mine
to produce between 20,000 and 30,000 troy ounces a year in Ghana.
Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said the project, when in full production at the
end of this year, would boost the company's annual gold output to 125,000
ounces, and take it into another emerging market in Africa. Current
production amounts to between 60,000 and 75,000 ounces from its Zimbabwe
mine.
Cluff estimates it will cost Dollars 6.8m (Pounds 4.53m) for the open pit
mine and heap leach operation at Ayanfuri, west of Dunkwa in central Ghana.
Cluff will own 75 per cent of the operating company and the Ghana government
10 per cent.
A 17,300-ounce gold loan has been arranged in London by Barclays Precious
Metals, bearing interest of about 5.5 per cent and repayable over three
years.
To minimise its exposure to the gold price, Cluff has put a three-year
hedging programme in place, involving 61,000 ounces of gold with an initial
floor price of Dollars 390 an ounce. Cluff says its total costs at Ayanfuri
are forecast to be Dollars 264 an ounce.
Proven reserves at Ayanfuri are 286,500 ounces, giving a mine life of 10
years, while the underlying sulphide ores have indicated resources of
288,300 ounces.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Audi chief expected to be forced out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Volkswagen's up-market Audi subsidiary, Mr Franz-Josef
Kortum, is expected to be forced to resign today after only 13 months in the
job.
The 43-year-old marketing specialist has clashed on several occasions with
his predecessor, Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial VW group chairman.
His place is expected to be filled by Mr Herbert Demel, development chief,
who will act as 'spokesman' for the Audi board, but not as chairman. This is
likely to lead to more direct control by Mr Piech.
Mr Kortum's removal may also lead to further turmoil in the VW group,
already racked by unexpected losses last year of DM2.3bn (Pounds 870m), and
striving to reach break-even in 1994.
Meanwhile suspicions of theft and industrial espionage in the wake of the
appointment of General Motors' former global purchasing chief, Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who joined last March, remain.
Mr Kortum's first set-to with Mr Piech occurred before his appointment, when
he rejected the 'spokesman' role and insisted on taking full control.
The conflict leading to his downfall has focused on the autocratic group
chairman's demands that Audi, which made a pre-tax loss of more than DM200m
in 1993, must be turned round this year. Mr Kortum has frequently appeared
unwilling to bend to his chief, who has swept away swathes of the old VW
management within his first year.
The most recent departure was that of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, chairman
of the Spanish subsidiary, Seat, who was sacked last September.

FT  04 FEB 94 / 'Lift-off' - but still not firing on every engine: A bumpy
ride for leisure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A January leisure sector publication from stockbrokers Smith New Court
carried the exultant headline 'We have lift-off'. Consumer spending was on
an upward trend. The hotel and leisure sector was set to benefit, the
publication said.
That was January last year. In the event, hotel and leisure companies had a
solid but uninspiring 1993, with the sector's shares tracking the FT-SE-A
All Share index for most of the year.
Mr Bruce Jones, a Smith New Court analyst, says his firm could have
reprinted last year's publication at the beginning of 1994. The same
optimistic noises are being heard. This time, however, many believe the
recovery is for real.
The basis of this optimism is difficult to detect. Overseas holiday bookings
are undoubtedly strong, but the trend in many domestic leisure pursuits
appears less cheerful. There are examples of more consumers going out to
spend money on leisure activities, but, in many cases, the amount each
spends is not going up. In other leisure businesses, spending per head has
increased, but the number of customers has not.
April's tax increases could reduce leisure spending further, ending the
optimistic view that this will be the year when leisure companies put
memories of the recession firmly behind them.
The sector's shares have outperformed the market by a clear margin since the
beginning of the year. Ladbroke, First Leisure, Rank, Airtours and Owners
Abroad have all registered impressive share price increases.
Yet the first round of leisure company results and trading statements has
provided many examples of consumers' reluctance to spend large sums on their
entertainment.
First Leisure, the discotheques, bowling and tourist attractions group, last
month announced pre-tax profits up 2.3 per cent to Pounds 31.8m on turnover
up 12.3 per cent to Pounds 121.8m.
While discotheque admissions were up 14 per cent, the group has not felt
able to raise admission prices. Spending per head in the group's bowling
business actually fell, while the number of games played remained stable.
The Rank Organisation, whose leisure businesses include bingo, casinos and
Butlin's holiday camps, last month announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
276.6m for the year to October 31, compared with a restated Pounds 125.8m
the previous year.
Despite the profits increase, Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, presented
a similar story of cautious leisure consumers. While admissions to Odeon
cinemas rose 10 per cent, largely boosted by the film Jurassic Park, strong
price competition meant that Rank could not increase the price of tickets.
Rank's UK nightclubs recorded a 13 per cent increase in admissions, but
spending per head remained static.
There were parts of Rank's business which attracted consumers who were
willing to splash out a little. Spending per head at the group's social and
bingo clubs increased by 6 per cent. At Rank's casinos, spending per head
rose 4 per cent. But admission numbers were static in both businesses.
Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, said last month that London hotel
occupancies were healthy, but that average rates paid had been slow to
recover.
There were some signs of improvement. Stakis, the hotels and casino group,
and Stanley Leisure, the betting shops and casino chain, announced big
profits increases. And Mr Gifford of Rank said consumer spending in the UK
and the US did now appear to be increasing.
But for unbridled optimism in the leisure sector, one has to turn to the
package holiday business. Airtours, the travel group appears to be in fine
shape. Last December it announced full year pre-tax profits up 24.6 per cent
to Pounds 45.5m, while bookings for this summer are up 56 per cent.
Many consumers seem to regard a holiday in the sun as a necessity,
particularly after last year's poor UK summer. They seem far more cautious
about spending on other activities.
Mr Jones of Smith New Court says he thinks rising consumer expenditure will
spill over into the leisure sector this year.
But Mr Mark Finnie, an analyst at NatWest Securities, feels that much of the
current optimism surrounding the sector has been overdone.
In the case of Ladbroke, whose interests include betting shops and the
Hilton International hotel chain, the shares have been boosted by senior
management changes. Outside the holiday sector, much of the enthusiasm for
leisure shares appears to be based on the view that business has been bad
for so long it is bound to get better.
There is another possibility: that recession has bred consumers determined
not to overspend and who will refuse to pay higher hotel rates or buy more
expensive cinema tickets even in times of prosperity.
But for many buyers of leisure shares, it is clearly too early in the year
to be that gloomy.

<TEXT>
The public offer for Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation Investment
Trust was more than Pounds 380m oversubscribed, confirming its position as
the largest UK investment trust launch ever.
Applications for Pounds 560m-worth of shares were received during the public
offer, which closed on Wednesday, giving the fund a potential size of Pounds
880m, as Pounds 320m had already been raised through an institutional
placing, but it was capped at Pounds 500m.
However, the Mercury European Privatisation Trust has set its maximum size
at Pounds 575m, so it could soon beat Kleinwort's record. The Mercury fund
raised Pounds 325m in its placing, which closed on Wednesday, and is seeking
a further Pounds 100m from an intermediaries offer, closing February 25, and
Pounds 150m from a public offer, closing March 2.
If all the disappointed investors from the Kleinwort offer now apply for the
Mercury fund, it will also be oversubscribed.
Investors who applied for the minimum 2,000 Kleinwort shares will receive
700. Applications for up to 2m shares will get about 31.45 per cent, and
those for more than 2m shares will receive 31.45 of the first 2m and 25 per
cent thereafter. One free warrant will be issued with every five shares.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Transatlantic to float shopping group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares are to be offered in a new property company which will own seven
shopping centres, including the Lakeside complex in Thurrock, the largest in
southern England.
Capital Shopping Centres will become one of the seven largest listed
property companies on the London Stock Exchange. It will have gross assets
of Pounds 800m. Lakeside will account for half.
CSC is being created by Transatlantic Holdings, the life assurance and
property group controlled by Mr Donald Gordon, the South African financier.
He is best known for founding his country's largest insurance group, Liberty
Life, and buying into the UK's Sun Life and Sun Alliance.
Transatlantic, which is 54 per cent owned by Liberty Life and 19 per cent by
France's largest insurer UAP, will retain 75 per cent of the new company's
shares (issued at net asset value). It will also keep its non-retail
properties, worth Pounds 600m, and its half share of Sun Life and 3 per cent
stake in Sun Alliance.
The demerger will provide new funds for the retail operation. Transatlantic
hopes it will also lead to a more attractive valuation for the retail
properties.
Brokers expected significant interest in the issue. 'I think the market will
like the idea of having a large specialist retail property company,' said Mr
Chris Turner, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. According to the brokerage, the
property sector is trading at a 19 per cent premium to its asset value, and
it is expected CSC will be priced above asset value.
Transatlantic will also raise an additional Pounds 200m from a convertible
bond issue. Mr Gordon, chairman, said this was to pay off floating-rate debt
and the Pounds 162m recently paid to increase the company's interest in the
Harlequin shopping centre in Watford.
Of the seven shopping centres to be owned by CSC, three have been built
since 1990. Mr Gordon said increasing consumer confidence meant potential
for a substantial increase in rental income.
Excluding the Harlequin centre, CSC's rental income is estimated at Pounds
28.4m for 1993, and the Harlequin would be expected to contribute at least
Pounds 10m in 1994.
The flotation, planned for April, is to be co-sponsored by Morgan Stanley
and Jardine Fleming.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Papers' profits suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to slash the prices of The Times and the Sun newspapers lay
behind a 34 per cent fall in operating profits at News International in the
six months to December.
In July the price of the Sun was cut from 25p to 20p, while in early
September The Times cover charge was reduced from 45p to 30p. Operating
profits at the group - a subsidiary of the Australian News Corporation  -
fell from Pounds 76.2m to Pounds 49.8m.
A cushioning factor was the sharp increase in contribution from its 50 per
cent interest in BSkyB, the satellite television broadcaster. News
International's share of BSkyB's operating profits rose from Pounds 7.5m to
Pounds 30.9m. A further Pounds 10m was made from the sale of a satellite.
This helped pre-tax profits to increase by 45 per cent, from Pounds 86.9m to
Pounds 126.7m. Turnover eased from Pounds 347.8m to Pounds 344.6m.
The impact of the newspaper price war was partly offset by higher
circulation, a rise of more than 10 per cent in advertising revenues and
continuing cost cutting, the company said.
The daily circulation of The Times rose from 359,000 in August to 439,000 in
December, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Sun's
circulation went from 3.4m in July to almost 3.8m in December. The company
believes it could top 4m for January.
News International said it had no immediate plans to end the price cuts on
either paper. On Monday this week readers of The Times were given the chance
to lock in the 30p weekday price until January next year. While Mr Peter
Stothard, editor, said there were no plans to increase the price, he warned:
'It is always impossible to predict the pressures of rising costs'.
BSkyB, in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake,
attributed the growth in its profits to a 40 per cent increase in
subscribers to 3.25m. It described last December as its best ever month for
dish sales, estimated at 130,000.
News International's interest income rose from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 23.5m,
reflecting lower rates and other financing transactions. News also reported
a Pounds 12.5m gain from disposals, mainly from the sale of Pearson stock.
Earnings per share rose from 8.47p to 9.32p. The interim pay-out on special
dividend shares is 0.72p (0.70p).

FT  04 FEB 94 / Audi chief expected to be forced out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Volkswagen's up-market Audi subsidiary, Mr Franz-Josef
Kortum, is expected to be forced to resign today after only 13 months in the
job.
The 43-year-old marketing specialist has clashed on several occasions with
his predecessor, Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial VW group chairman.
His place is expected to be filled by Mr Herbert Demel, development chief,
who will act as 'spokesman' for the Audi board, but not as chairman. This is
likely to lead to more direct control by Mr Piech.
Mr Kortum's removal may also lead to further turmoil in the VW group,
already racked by unexpected losses last year of DM2.3bn (Pounds 870m), and
striving to reach break-even in 1994.
Meanwhile suspicions of theft and industrial espionage in the wake of the
appointment of General Motors' former global purchasing chief, Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who joined last March, remain.
Mr Kortum's first set-to with Mr Piech occurred before his appointment, when
he rejected the 'spokesman' role and insisted on taking full control.
The conflict leading to his downfall has focused on the autocratic group
chairman's demands that Audi, which made a pre-tax loss of more than DM200m
in 1993, must be turned round this year. Mr Kortum has frequently appeared
unwilling to bend to his chief, who has swept away swathes of the old VW
management within his first year.
The most recent departure was that of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, chairman
of the Spanish subsidiary, Seat, who was sacked last September.
Mr Piech last month accused Mr Daz of deception over Seat's DM1.4bn losses
in 1993, and warned of possible 'penal consequences'. Others to go included
Mr Daniel Goedevert, the respected VW group deputy chairman, replaced by Mr
Lopez. The group purchasing chief was replaced by Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez,
formerly Mr Lopez's closest associate at GM.
Meanwhile, Volkswagen yesterday withdrew a claim made on Wednesday quoting a
Frankfurt judge as saying charges that General Motors secret documents had
come into VW's possession 'could not be proved'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media, film and publishing group,
posted a 27.5 per cent increase in profits for the six months to December,
with the help of higher earnings from Ansett Airlines and the BSkyB
satellite broadcaster.
News Corp said that it made a profit of ADollars 624.9m (Pounds 300m) after
tax but before abnormal items, up from ADollars 490.1m. First-half sales
were ADollars 5.82bn, against ADollars 5.33bn, and earnings per share
(before abnormals) increased by 13 per cent to 34 cents.
The results were ahead of expectations and the shares jumped 52 cents to
ADollars 10.56.
Operating profits were slightly lower at ADollars 861.1m after the newspaper
division declined to ADollars 266.3m from ADollars 349.1m, and the magazines
and insets business fell to ADollars 169.5m from ADollars 208.2m.
However, there was a strong performance from the film division, including
Twentieth Century Fox. Operating profits more than trebled to ADollars
101.1m, helped by the recent box-office hit Mrs Doubtfire.
The book publishing division posted profits of ADollars 126.2m, against
ADollars 113.6m, helped by 'brisk' sales of Margaret Thatcher's memoirs.
Associated companies - Ansett, which News owns jointly with TNT, and BSkyB,
of which News holds 50 per cent - doubled their contributions to ADollars
190.1m.
Net interest charges fell to ADollars 343.9m (ADollars 387.4m). News also
benefited from an abnormal gain of ADollars 144m, part of it from the sale
of a 34.9 per cent interest in The South China Morning Post. This left
profits after tax and abnormals at ADollars 768.9m, against ADollars 452.8m.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Japan PM's tax plan delayed amid turmoil: Socialists force
rethink after threat to coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, was forced to go back to the
drawing board early today on his sweeping plans for tax reform and a
Y15,100bn (Pounds 90bn) economic stimulus package.
A crisis meeting with his coalition partners to try to reach a compromise on
the tax plans broke up without agreement. Officials said discussions would
have to go back to 'square one' and a wholesale revision of the plans was
likely.
The fresh turmoil in Japanese politics began building up yesterday when the
Social Democratic party threatened to walk out of the seven-party ruling
coalition in protest at Mr Hosokawa's plan to raise sales tax.
Earlier a triumphant Mr Hosokawa had unveiled proposals for an income tax
cut worth Y18,000bn over the next three years, to be funded by a 7 per cent
'people's welfare tax' to replace the present 3 per cent sales tax in 1997.
The socialist SDP, elected on a promise not to raise sales tax, protested
that it had not been properly consulted.
Disquiet spread to other coalition members, including one of Mr Hosokawa's
closest allies, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who also
threatened to resign if the SDP were not offered a satisfactory compromise.
Negotiators from the coalition parties met until late last night without
patching up their differences and failed again when talks resumed early
today.
The SDP has asked for the 7 per cent rate to be suspended - although it does
not take effect for three years - while a consultative body debates a new
rate. It also wants a promise to spend all the extra revenue on welfare,
initially rejected by Mr Hosokawa.
Political analysts have warned that fresh political turmoil might hamper Mr
Hosokawa's hopes of persuading the US of his government's determination to
stimulate economic demand. The Japanese prime minister is due to meet
President Bill Clinton in Washington next week for so-called trade framework
talks.
Details of the Y15,100bn package were released after a meeting between Mr
Hosokawa and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic
party, which has started to co-operate with the coalition since last week's
compromise on political reform. But it cannot be adopted by cabinet and sent
to parliament until the row over tax is settled.
The package, slightly larger than expected, includes Y6,000bn of annual tax
cuts, mostly affecting income and residence tax. There is another Y9,100bn
of government spending and loans, which includes Y2,900bn of public works
and Y2,800bn of land purchases.
The tax cuts are worth 1.2 per cent of gross national product.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Vietnam market opens for US as Clinton ends trade embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night announced the lifting of the US embargo on
trade with Vietnam, marking a big step towards normal relations between the
two countries.
The move opens the way for billions of dollars of US exports to the
burgeoning Vietnamese market.
Mr Clinton said Vietnam had provided 'significant and tangible results' in
the US's search to account for more than 2,000 servicemen listed as missing
in action (MIA) during the war. 'I have made the judgment that the best way
to ensure co-operation with Vietnam . . . is to end the embargo on trade,'
he said.
While the US also plans to set up a liaison office, Mr Clinton insisted that
full return to diplomatic relations would require further progress on the
MIA issue. He said he had no idea how big the trade opportunities might be
in Vietnam, as he had refused all briefings on this subject in order 'to
make sure that the trade question did not enter into this decision'.
But US businesses, 34 of which already have offices in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh
City, have been keen to develop interests in Vietnam, as their French,
Japanese, South Korean and Australian competitors have moved into its
rapidly emerging economy.
Last night Vietnam's mission to the United Nations welcomed the decision,
saying it opened a new era. However, in the US, some veterans' groups,
former prisoners of war and conservative Republicans attacked it. Mr Robert
Dole, Senate minority leader, said the time for such a move had not yet
arrived.
Economic sanctions were begun against North Vietnam in 1964, shortly after
US military advisers became involved, and were extended to the whole country
after the Saigon fell in 1975.
Some US businessmen had feared a partial lifting of the embargo which could
have proved a severe competitive handicap. Companies such as Mobil, Chevron,
Boeing, Caterpillar and Digital have shown particular interest in Vietnam.
Over the last six years Vietnam has authorised 863 foreign ventures with
total approved capital of around Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 5bn), and a state
committee said last week that it expected Dollars 14bn of foreign investment
in the next 10 years.
The issue of the MIAs is highly sensitive in the US.  Former president
George Bush was strongly criticised when he addressed MIA families in 1992
and Mr Clinton, who evaded military Vietnam service, was jeered during a
ceremony at Washington's war memorial.

FT  04 FEB 94 / German money supply rise damps rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German money supply rose at an unexpectedly high rate in December as large
inflows of cash from outside the country were accompanied by a surge in
domestic lending, the Bundesbank said yesterday.
The announcement jolted the bond market and reduced hopes that the German
central bank would soon move to reduce the discount and Lombard rates. They
have stood at 5.75 and 6.75 per cent since last October.
Financial markets were prepared for a high figure but the 8.1 per cent
increase in M3 was much greater than expected. M3 measures broad money on
which the Bundesbank relies for its estimates of inflationary developments.
The figure was considerably higher than the 7.2 per cent growth in November
and well above the 4.5-6.5 per cent growth target for last year.
Yesterday's figures mean M3 growth, on an annualised, seasonally adjusted
basis, has exceeded the target range for three successive years.
There was further disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut interest
rates after yesterday's meeting of its policymaking council and there was a
strong sell-off in the bond market. Yields on five-year government bonds
climbed by 6 basis points to 5.17 per cent.
Mr Peter Lang, economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank in Munich, said the M3
growth would 'reinforce the Bundesbank's caution in bringing down interest
rates', but another economist, playing down the figures, said: 'What the
Bundesbank really looks at is inflation and that is coming down sharply.'
The Bundesbank said the exceptional factors which had led to the sharp rise
in December had already been partly reversed in January. It blamed what it
called the extraordinarily high increase in M3 on two chief factors - a
surge in domestic bank lending and the influx of DM59.2bn (Dollars 34.2bn)
into the banking system in December.
The capital influx exceeded that of September 1992, when DM42.7bn flowed
into Germany amid currency market turmoil. The Bundesbank said this movement
was attributable to tax changes which made it attractive for individuals to
repatriate investments from Luxembourg, coupled with the impact of the
repatriation of corporate deposits from the Euromarket. Domestic lending
rose 10.3 per cent, due mainly to a surge in mortgage borrowing.
Economists said the Bundesbank's decision not to cut rates was also
conditioned by a bout of sabre-rattling in the dispute over pay for
metalworkers.

FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Transatlantic Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of 25 per cent of Capital Shopping Centres will come as a
welcome addition to the quoted property sector. Prime shopping centres are
currently the hottest property investment market and Capital boasts one of
the biggest portfolios of such sites. The flotation will give Capital
greater flexibility to restart a development programme or buy other
prestigious retail sites. Its parent, Transatlantic, is hardly flush with
cash itself. A recapitalisation of Capital is a simple way to gear up for
the next cycle. Most other big property companies have tapped the
institutions; it seems only fair that Capital should take its turn.
The intriguing aspect is how ambitious Transatlantic will be with the
pricing. Capital's properties have never knowingly been undervalued. Mr
Donald Gordon, Transatlantic's chairman, has long complained of the
conservative valuation techniques used by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, but Trans-atlantic clearly hopes for a considerable premium over
its stated asset values.
The flotation further raises suspicions that Transatlantic intends some
bolder adventure in the insurance sector. Sun Alliance is the obvious
target. But, by itself, Capital's flotation is likely to make little
difference to any such ambitions in this field, with only about Pounds 150m
of new finance being raised.

<TEXT>
The 5 per cent rise in News Corporation's shares in response to perky
interim results will help restore the company's reputation, which took
something of a bashing following its plans to issue super voting shares.
Ansett and BSkyB made particularly strong contributions to the results. Only
the self-induced pain of the newspaper price-cutting campaign in the UK
blotted News's progress.
The withdrawal of the super share proposals has seemingly stymied any grand
strategic ambitions that Mr Rupert Murdoch may have entertained. The company
has an understandable aversion to bank debt to fund expansion. Its ability
to issue straight equity is restricted by the desire not to dilute the
Murdoch holding below 32 per cent. Still, News has plenty left to chew on at
present. Star TV, which is likely to lose Dollars 20m in the full year,
should absorb much of Mr Murdoch's energies as he attempts to transform it
into a subscription service. Fox Network will also have to work hard to
justify the high price it paid for its American football rights.
News's existing investments are therefore likely to take time to deliver.
Australian industrial stocks should certainly post a faster rate of earnings
growth for the foreseeable future. But towards the end of the decade, that
picture could change fast. If BSkyB blossoms, Star comes good, and the
American football contract starts delivering fat advertising revenue then
News should be printing money. The strength of that revenue stream could
even be sufficient to fund the bigger strategic moves.

FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The current contest to produce the world's most powerful aero engine seems
to be driven by machismo. While very high thrust engines are required for
new wide-body twin-engined jets, the recent tests of the GE90 and
Rolls-Royce's Trent engines produce 25 per cent more power than such
aircraft currently require. At present only the Airbus A330 and the Boeing
777 need these engines, yet GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls have all invested
hundreds of millions in this technology while orders have been scarce. All
three have to compete on power and price for what business there is.
In that context, Rolls' loss of the engine order for Japan Airlines' new
Boeing 777s is disappointing but unsurprising. JAL can hardly afford to
spend lavishly and, since two other Japanese airlines have already specified
Pratt engines for their 777 fleets, JAL has an incentive to share
maintainance facilities. Rolls may be leading the race for orders on the
Airbus 330, but is lagging badly with the more significant Boeing 777. That
has stretched out the pay-back period for the Trent.
Perhaps even more significantly, the market may not grow rapidly enough to
justify the investment in three such engines. With orders unlikely to pick
up for at least two years, competition will intensify. Pratt and GE both
have deeper pockets than Rolls, and bigger balance sheets to support a
protracted fight. They are also less dependent on the aerospace cycle.
Rolls' rating of 50 times likely 1993 earnings seems to reflect more than
generously the company's own sunny optimism.

FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Money worries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank was never likely to cut interest rates yesterday, with
December M3 money supply growing at an annualised rate of 8.1 per cent. It
matters little that the figure was badly distorted, or that the underlying
news on inflation and wages is good, or even that the D-mark has been more
stable in exchange markets recently. The bank could not announce a money
supply figure so far above target and then cut rates without serious loss of
credibility. What is less clear is whether money supply was the only factor
holding it back.
The international interest rate trend has become difficult to read as market
rumours intensify of a possible Federal Reserve tightening. Talk yesterday
that such action was imminent damped US financial markets. It also unsettled
others, including the UK, which had run up earlier in anticipation of
another round of European interest rate cuts. The Fed's intentions are, of
course, by no means certain and the current US inflation picture does not
suggest a need for urgent action. When it does come, though, the exchange
market impact of a Fed tightening will inevitably make the Bundesbank more
circumspect.
Even if the Bundesbank is simply worried about the money supply, nothing is
likely to happen before the next council meeting that would make it change
its mind on rates. Its cautious pace may thus continue to disappoint. A UK
rate cut looks even more remote, especially since the latest reserve figures
suggest the authorities prefer to counter sterling strength by intervention.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Mr Hosokawa's balancing act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese politics is changing fast, as the hostile domestic political
reception given to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's latest Y14,000bn
(Pounds 84bn) fiscal package, designed to boost the Japanese economic
recovery, reveals. Mr Hosokawa's proposed tax package - a combination of
immediate income tax cuts and a deferred rise in the consumption tax  - has
cautious Ministry of Finance and US government approval. But that, it seems,
is no longer enough. Managing a fractious coalition in Japan's new democracy
means that the prime minister must take other interests into account, not
least the wishes of his coalition partners.
The point currently holding up announcement of the economic package is a
planned rise in Japan's consumption tax from 3 per cent to 7 per cent from
April 1997. The MoF, worried about the profligate tendencies of Japan's
politicians, has fought tooth and nail to ensure that the tax package is
revenue neutral. It calculates that the Y6,000bn tax cut, the extra welfare
spending to soften the blow of the consumption tax increase, and the cost of
servicing extra borrowing before that tax rise, would mean a combined cost
of Y9,500bn a year after 1997. A 4 percentage point increase in the
consumption tax should cover this.
US endorsement
The US government, keen to see the Japanese government boost consumption,
increase imports and so reduce its trade surplus, has consistently opposed
this increase in consumption taxation on the grounds that it would
jeopardise recovery. But it has also made it clear that a deferred
consumption tax rise would be fine so long as the net effect of the package
was large enough.
How stimulatory Mr Hosokawa's package would actually be will not be known
until the full details are released. The MoF's baffling determination to
announce the headline value of fiscal packages, while refusing to disclose a
baseline figure against which the extra spending and tax cuts could be
compared, makes reading Japanese fiscal pronouncements difficult. But the
fact that the US Treasury secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, has given a cautious
endorsement of the proposed package suggests Mr Hosokawa got the
international politics right.
Whether the package as planned would deliver the Japanese recovery that the
US Treasury wants is more doubtful. The problems in the Japanese banking
system and the current strength of the yen suggest that a further easing of
monetary policy would be more effective, especially if reinforced by a rise
in US rates. But widespread deregulation of the economy is the only way to
reduce the trade surplus permanently.
Bad miscalculation
Yet Mr Hosokawa, flush perhaps from last week's success in forcing through
his electoral reform bill, appears to have badly miscalculated domestic
opposition to higher consumption taxes, even in deferred form.
By renaming the measure a 'people's welfare tax', suggesting a link to
higher welfare spending, he appears to have reasoned that, despite Socialist
opposition, support from the rest of the coalition and the LDP would carry
the measures through. But the strength of opposition across the coalition,
the LDP and the Japanese press suggests that Mr Hosokawa may be fighting a
losing battle.
To ignore the MoF's concerns and simply remove the consumption tax increase
from the package would be a mistake. Japanese and international experience
suggests that unstable politics can easily lead to fiscal profligacy. But
the MoF's insistence on a revenue-neutral package is unnecessarily severe.
Even after four previous fiscal packages, the OECD calculates that Japan had
a structural (cyclically adjusted) budget surplus equal to 0.8 per cent of
gross domestic product last year, compared with deficits of 3.3 per cent in
the US, 3.7 per cent in Germany and 5 per cent in the UK.
What Japan's prime minister needs is a compromise that satisfies the MoF,
holds together the coalition and allows him to pursue the deregulatory
agenda that is the key to trade relations with the US. If a smaller rise in
the consumption tax is the price of a deal, then the MoF must be prepared to
accept it.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Public pay arithmetic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government was right yesterday to accept the recommendations of
pay review bodies covering teachers, nurses, doctors, the armed forces and
top public officials.
A decision to override the recommendations for a second year in a row would
have fatally undermined the independent pay review system. This has been
valuable in depoliticising the setting of pay rates for over 1.5m workers
who account for about a third of all public-sector staff.
Moreover the pay increases, which are mostly in the 2.75 per cent to 3 per
cent range, seem a reasonable compromise between employer and employee
interests. The rises are certainly greater than ministers would have liked.
But they are also less than the employees were seeking. Once April's tax
increases bite, affected workers will still be worse off in real terms.
It was also good to see the review bodies inching in the direction of more
decentralised pay-setting. Pay should be set by reference to the balance
between supply and demand in local labour markets. Much more needs to be
done on this score.
In a sense, though, accepting the recommendations was the easy part of the
government's task. Now comes the hard part: squaring the pay increases with
the government's stated policy of freezing the public sector pay bill in
cash terms.
The government has been consistently mealy-mouthed about what this policy
means since it was announced last September and extended from a one-year to
a three-year freeze in November's Budget. In particular, ministers have
sought to give the impression that provided people work hard and improve
their productivity, not only will pay rise but there will be no need to cut
jobs.
Simple arithmetic
Greater productivity is desirable. But it is irrelevant to the government's
policy of a pay bill freeze. If pay increases by 3 per cent, then the number
of employees must also fall by a broadly similar amount for the pay bill to
stay unchanged. This is a matter of simple arithmetic.
Not surprisingly, government officials have recently been retreating from
the idea of a pay bill freeze, though the policy switch has not been spelt
out. The current approach appears to be that it is government departments'
overall running costs, not their pay bills, that will be frozen. This means
in theory that cost savings achieved outside the pay bill could be used to
increase pay and maintain staffing levels. However, given that pay typically
accounts for about two-thirds of running costs, job cuts seem unavoidable.
There are several directions in which ministers might be tempted to avoid
this conclusion. But none is appealing.
Future troubles
First, the government could bear down particularly hard on the wages of
those workers not covered by pay review bodies. Not only would this be
unfair. It would also store up troubles for the future, as employees sought
to catch up on pay rises they missed this year. The macroeconomic
consequences could be wage pressures just at the wrong time in the business
cycle.
Second, ministers could abandon their policy of freezing running costs/pay
bills. But this would mean either easing up on the battle to control the
public-sector deficit or raising yet more taxes. Neither is an attractive
option.
That leaves job cuts as the main way of increasing pay rates while freezing
pay bills or departmental running costs. Perhaps that has been ministers'
secret agenda all along. Certainly, it is the most credible course of action
given the gaping budget deficit and the need to maintain confidence in the
review bodies.
The trade unions and the Labour party will not, of course, see things that
way. They say job cuts will lead to cuts in public services and/or a
deterioration in quality.
But this is defeatist. The public sector is already achieving improvements
in productivity. The record of the privatised industries, where jobs have
been cut in large numbers while service standards have improved, is a
dramatic pointer to what can be attained. The challenge for ministers must
be to achieve similar improvements in the public sector.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Why Rover left home: Nostalgia for the UK's car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If this week's letter columns in the British press are a guide, the sale of
Rover to BMW is being condemned up and down the country. This is perfectly
natural. In the psychology of any manufacturing nation, the car industry
plays a role which goes beyond mere economics. Even in a country whose
industrial self-esteem is as low as the UK's, the collapse of the last big
carmaker into foreign hands is bound to cause an atavistic twitch.
How far this is rational is another matter. In terms of industrial logic,
the game was up for Rover a decade ago and more. The last cars which it
developed on its own were the Maestro and Montego in the early 1980s. Ever
since, it has relied heavily on Honda for design and engineering. The Rover
600, launched last year, is nothing more than a lightly disguised Honda
Accord. The fact that future Rovers may be similarly disguised BMWs is
regrettable, but no worse than the status quo.
Land Rover is, of course, a different matter: a highly successful British
product, domestically designed and made. There is no reason to suppose this
will change. When car companies merge, the key to saving costs is designing
a common chassis. But BMW has no chassis relevant to Land Rover, nor does it
plan to produce one. It has every incentive to leave well alone, except that
its much bigger dealer network will presumably help Land Rover's sales
overseas.
But, the letter-writers will say, this is beside the point. Previously,
Rover was British-owned and controlled. Now it is not. True enough: but
again, the damage was done a long time ago. Granted, Rover's present owner,
British Aerospace, is as true-blue as they come. But its purchase of Rover
from the UK government in 1988 owed at least as much to politics as to
commercial logic. Not for the first time, privatisation was a convenient
means of ducking a politically awkward issue: in this case, the ultimate
necessity of selling Rover into foreign hands. As an expedient, it was
always bound to be temporary. There was no industrial case for BAe owning
Rover; and financially, as BAe conceded this week, it simply could not
afford to develop both Rover and its defence business in the long run.
All the while, it was clear that Rover was too small to survive alone. It
needed to merge with another car company. There being no other British
volume car company left, this logically meant merging with a foreigner. The
foreigner also had to be strong enough for the merger to thrive. Logically,
this also meant that Rover had to be the junior partner.
Rover had already learnt this lesson the hard way, when it sold its Leyland
truck business to Daf in 1987. Daf proved too weak a partner, and the merged
company went bust last year. BMW may not be among the giants of the world
car industry, but it has three times Rover's turnover. It is also
consistently profitable, whereas Rover has made a loss before tax for the
past three years at least.
None of this means that Britain's demise as an independent car producer is
welcome. On the one hand, Britain has on balance benefited from its
open-door policy on inward investment, especially from Japanese makers of
cars and consumer electronics. But it is not all plain sailing. Scotland's
high-technology electronics industry, for instance, has found that turning
out silicon chips and personal computers for its American masters has done
little to develop the local supply of technology or components.
Again, Britain's openness to foreign takeover is the necessary counterpart
of its appetite for buying companies overseas. Indeed, some foreign
takeovers of UK companies seem genuinely to have helped both parties.
Nestle's highly contentious takeover of Rowntree six years ago has done
nothing to harm Britain's output of chocolate. Siemens's purchase of large
chunks of Plessey at around the same time was a step towards the German
company building a Pounds 1bn turnover business in the UK.
But there is always the risk that a foreign buyer will simply seize the
opportunity of closing down a competitor. Thomson of France bought Ferguson,
the television manufacturer, only to shut UK production and keep the brand.
General Electric of the US bought Thorn's UK lighting business, and is now
closing much of it in favour of manufacturing in Hungary.
In Rover's case, there is a more specific danger. As an ex-chairman of Land
Rover pointed out in the FT's letter columns yesterday, the history of
takeovers in the car industry - as elsewhere - is littered with failures.
BMW has grown organically throughout its history, and has no previous
experience of merger. If it all goes wrong, Rover as the underdog may get
more than its share of the kicking.
Thus, this week's announcement cannot be greeted with rejoicing. Of course
there are risks involved. Of course Britain would be better off making its
own cars. But the peculiarly emotional character of the industry has merely
postponed an inevitable event. Now that it has finally arrived, there is no
use crying over spilt milk: especially when it was spilt such a long time
ago.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Chorus of the master mudslingers: Dirty campaigns and
uncertainty mean German election results are unlikely to be clear-cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If anyone thought that Germany's marathon election year was going to be a
good, clean-cut campaign about issues, they need to think again. The
mudslinging has only just begun.
First it was about supposed revelations from the personal files of the late
Chancellor Willy Brandt, casting suspicion on his colleagues in the Social
Democratic party (SPD) as alleged fellow-travellers with the East German
communists.
This week it was the old story suggesting that Mr Johannes Rau, elder
statesman of the SPD and the party's candidate for federal president in May,
was given electoral support by the former East Germans in the 1986 general
elections.
In retaliation, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister-party, the
Christian Social Union, stands accused of having promised to 'respect' East
German citizenship (which the west refused to recognise officially) as part
of a deal to stop the flow of asylum-seekers across the inner-German border.
Mud was also flung at the Berlin city leader of the Free Democratic party
(FDP), the minority partner in the ruling coalition. She was forced to
resign over the so-called 'Figaro affair', in which she is alleged to have
charged her hairdressing bills to the party funds.
To an outsider, it all appears remarkably arcane and irrelevant. To many
voters in eastern Germany, voting in a western democratic system for only
the second time, it looks the same. But it does give an indication of the
political backbiting still to come.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD's new leader and youthful challenger for the
chancellor's job, warned his party faithful last week that the campaign
could rapidly degenerate. 'We all know that when it really comes to the
crunch, when it is a question of hanging on to power itself, the CDU and CSU
will fight ruthlessly to protect their position,' he said. 'The past days
have given us a foretaste of what is to come.'
There is an awful lot to play for, with 19 separate elections on the cards:
from the state election in Lower Saxony on March 13 to the general election
for the Bundestag on October 16, via the electoral college vote for state
president in May, European elections in June, and a string of state and
local polls.
Given a rising tide of disaffection in the electorate at large for the
entire political establishment, and a whole new area of uncertainty in
former East Germany, predictions are still a risky business.
There is no decisive lead in the polls between the broad blocks of left and
right, although the opposition Social Democratic party clearly has the edge
at the moment. More confusingly, there is a range of parties that could
attract protest votes, ranging from the well-established Greens, through the
former Communist party in the east - the party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)
 -to the far-right Republicans, and at least two anti-party citizens'
movements.
Not only is a messy series of campaigns in prospect, but a messy outcome
too.
The most cautious opinion poll, the Politbarometer broadcast every month by
the ZDF television station, puts the SPD on 39 per cent support, the CDU/CSU
on 36 per cent, the Greens on 10 per cent, and the FDP on 6 per cent - 'if
there were general elections next Sunday'.
That means that neither leftwing (SPD-Green) nor rightwing (CDU/CSU-FDP)
coalitions would be able to gain a clear majority in the Bundestag, the
directly elected lower house of parliament, in October. It would only take
one or two protest parties to gain the 5 per cent of votes needed to get
into the Bundestag, to make a grand coalition of left and right - SPD and
CDU - unavoidable.
The fact is that west Germany - the old federal republic - is evenly split
between left and right. According to the other main polling organisation,
the Allensbach Institute, the SPD is on 38 per cent support, as against 36.4
for the CDU/CSU, in the west as a whole. The real difference between them
lies in the east.
That was where Chancellor Kohl won his re-election back in 1990, and that is
where he has seen his party support slump from almost 42 per cent then to
less than 20 per cent today. In the recent local elections in Brandenburg,
he suffered the ignominy of coming third, with the former Communists getting
more support. The opinion polls confirm that trend.
There is widespread bitterness in the east at the failure of western
politicians to realise the extent of the post-unification trauma they have
suffered. It centres above all on unemployment, and the fact that in
hundreds of small towns and villages, effective joblessness is anything from
50 to 70 per cent of the potentially active labour force. Before 1989,
unemployment did not officially exist there.
That bitterness has hit the CDU most of all, and the SPD should reap the
benefit. But the Social Democrats' party organisation is weak in the east:
they had to begin from scratch, because the old Social Democratic party had
been forcibly merged with the Communists. Party managers fear they may fail
to exploit the full potential of the protest.
The same is true in the west. Given the sharpest recession since the postwar
economic miracle in Germany began, the opposition should be coasting to
victory. In fact, the SPD is struggling to break the 40 per cent barrier.
The challenge for Mr Scharping is to demonstrate that his party is
regierungsfahig - fit for government. He has to persuade an essentially
conservative electorate that his party's reputation for internal squabbling
and utopianism is no longer true.
In the eight months since he became leader, he has made considerable
progress. He has whipped his fellow leaders, like the erratic Mr Oskar
Lafontaine, his chief economic spokesman, and the ambitious Mr Gerhard
Schroder, premier of Lower Saxony, into line. He has distanced himself from
any firm commitment to an SPD-Green coalition, which might scare off
middle-of-the-road voters. He has yet to put a foot wrong.
That is the problem for Chancellor Kohl, who exudes self-confidence in spite
of being the least popular of all Germany's leading politicians.
Mr Kohl is seeking to counter this unpopularity by presenting himself as the
safe hand on the tiller in uncertain times. His theme is security - from the
external instability of eastern Europe and Russia (ultra-nationalist leader
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's rise in the Russian elections is a big bonus), and
from the internal instability of economic recession. He knows that voters
normally opt for conservatives in times of trouble.
What is most worrying for his advisers is that even that safe bet seems in
doubt. According to another recent poll, 35 per cent think the SPD can lead
Germany out of the economic crisis, against 29 per cent for the CDU. As for
the party leaders, 36 per cent see Scharping as the better man for the
economy, as against 23 per cent for Kohl. The chancellor only scores better
on foreign policy (45 per cent) and the threat from Russia.
The other danger for the chancellor is that the election marathon might
produce a negative momentum, with the SPD scoring well in the state
elections, and building up an unstoppable drive to the Bundestag poll. That
was why the CDU resisted bitterly a move to hold early elections in
Saxony-Anhalt, where its feeble coalition with the FDP seems certain to lose
power. 'The danger of two SPD victories in March - in Lower Saxony and in
Saxony-Anhalt - could have been fatal,' according to one of the chancellor's
close aides.
Things still look pretty bleak for Mr Kohl. The European elections in June,
combined with an array of local council elections on the same day, may well
produce a big protest vote. All the established parties fear a good showing
by the extreme rightwing Republicans in the European poll, when voters feel
less constrained by any sense of responsibility.
Between now and then, Mr Kohl has to use all his political wiles to try to
turn the polls around. He is exploiting his opportunities for statesmanship,
such as his recent trip to Washington, to the full. But the German elections
will be decided above all by domestic issues, by measures to tackle
unemployment, law and order, and immigration.
At this stage, the most likely outcome must still be a grand coalition, with
a significant protest vote - including many who simply stay at home - above
all in the disenchanted east.

The CV can sometimes be an inglorious document, puffing this and concealing

European regional board of Invesco, the fund management group, is strangely
silent on two points.
Who's Who shows that Sir John was managing director (international
relations) of Maxwell Communications Corporation in 1989-90, and also on the
board of The European, the late Robert Maxwell's most ambitious newspaper
venture.
But perhaps Invesco is trying to learn from its mistakes; last year it was
fined a record Pounds 750,000 by Imro, the investment management regulator -
for a range of regulatory breaches in connection with the Maxwell affair.

The office of Chris Meyer, the no-nonsense press secretary charged with

how he plans to run the show.
Meyer has adorned his office with framed copies of Pravda, the once
all-powerful organ of the Soviet Communist party. Close inspection reveals
that the issues date not from post-democracy Russia, but instead from the
good old days, when anti-regime criticisms could merit a spell in the gulag.
Pravda's most important function then was to kid its readers that all was
well and the political leadership the best imaginable. Meyer's nostalgia may
be deeper than he thinks . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Here's a rum do. John Gummer, environment secretary, has just appointed as
chief planning adviser someone who is debarred from giving advice on one of
the biggest issues on Gummer's plate.
David Lock has been hired to advise on the development of strategic land use
planning in England. But Lock can't talk to Gummer about what is going to
happen to the East Thames corridor - a key element in government plans to
regenerate London and the south-east - because he also runs a consultancy
with extensive contracts in that same corridor.
As the environment department has yet to publish its strategic plan for the
corridor, Lock must maintain a Trappist silence not just over the corridor
but also the Channel tunnel rail link.
To make matters worse, Lock's appointment means farewell to the highly
respected Peter Hall, special adviser on planning to three environment
secretaries since 1991. Hall, Britain's top thinker on planning and urban
development, was brought back from the University of California by Michael
Heseltine, and has spearheaded the East London corridor concept. He now
returns to a full-time chair at University College, London.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Observer: The siren calls of Paris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Does the British government ever talk to itself? Lord Lawson, bidding to be
next boss of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is
not the only Brit seeking a cushy job in Paris. Robert Priddle, a deputy
secretary at the DTI, is also being pushed to be executive director of the
International Energy Agency.
It's all rather odd. The IEA is an OECD affiliate - they share the same
headquarters in Paris's fashionable 16th arrondissement - and it's unusual
for a government to chase the two top jobs in allied institutions,
especially when both are hotly contested.
Number 10 and the Treasury have thrown their collective weight behind
Lawson's candidacy for the OECD. However, the DTI has been backing Priddle,
55, for the IEA post - against candidates from Belgium, Norway and Italy -
since the middle of last year. Although there is no vacancy yet, the present
incumbent, Helga Steeg, 66, is expected to retire later this year, after 10
years in the post.
Priddle is better qualified than his present post - head of the DTI's
corporate and consumer affairs division - might suggest. An energy expert,
he chaired the IEA governing board between October 1991 and September 1992.
He was also in charge of the UK government's energy policy until late
October 1992, when he was transferred to his present post one week after the
crisis over coal pit closures.
Qualified he may be; but with a government apparently unable to get its
internal communications straight, he may still have problems getting that
message through.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Time-out for the Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the coming weekend is like most of the others to which we have become
accustomed the Sunday papers will call for Mr John Major's head. Come to
think of it, the axeman's cry is frequently heard on weekdays as well. It is
misplaced. A new prime minister would not solve Britain's problems; nor
would any known candidate necessarily reunite the Tories. What is required
is a new government.
First elected in 1979, this Conservative administration has worn itself out.
The party's authority will return one day but it needs a period away from
the distractions of office. A few years of relief from care and
responsibility - all those loyal worthies to put in charge of all those
quangos - would give it time to reconnect its thinking with the concerns of
the electorate. When they are ex-ministers some of the brighter members of
the cabinet may come to understand that focusing on the outstanding element
of the 1980s mix - the efficacy of the market allied to the cult of the
individual - is not a sufficient foundation for governance in the present
decade or the forthcoming new century. This broadening of thought is
impossible while the Tories, who have lost their reputation, remain
nominally in power.
On a previous occasion I observed that the factions we see today might be
compared with the Christian Democrats and liberals of continental European
politics. Such a pair is in open coalition in Germany; in Britain the two
traditions are found within the one party. Some of our economic liberals
have souped themselves up with an inhalation of little England nationalism.
This internal Tory coalition has ceased to function with the smoothness
necessary for competent government.
Attempts to keep its various components in balance are always difficult, and
cannot succeed while the government's majority is so small. If an
administration is to be strong, and successful, one faction must appear to
prevail, as the liberal nationalists did while the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher was prime minister. The Christian Democrats had their day under
Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath. Whoever is in the driving seat, the
opposing faction must never be pushed too far, as Lady Thatcher almost
always recognised and Mr Heath rarely did.
If the latter approach is not possible a workmanlike understanding be-tween
the two tendencies must be reached. Mr Macmillan, as he was known while in
Downing Street, kept everyone guessing. In the end he destroyed himself.
What we have at present is a daily attempt to create a compromise that will
get the government through the night. The result is a series of panicky
decisions and policy reversals, not to mention regular relaunches and
repositionings of the overall strategy. Such confusion is debilitating for a
party in power, although in opposition it might be classed as honest debate.
This week, for example, the government has been obliged to retract clauses
that would centralise control over the police and subject the running of
magistrates' courts to private-sector management theory. It is in
difficulties elsewhere, as with its plans to prevent undergraduates from
using student union funds in the experimental and idealistic manner that is
expected of the young, and in further attempts to wipe local government off
the map.
In ordinary circumstances such a list of setbacks would constitute welcome
evidence that the democratic process was working as we idealists believe it
should. Government proposes; parliament, assisted by public opinion, amends.
The result is better legislation. These are not, however, ordinary
circumstances. The legislative programme is in difficulties because, as a
senior member of the cabinet put it this week, the government is attempting
to reach those parts of the body politic that Lady Thatcher herself never
dared to approach. The latter privatised the easy targets. The ministry that
has succeeded her is unwilling or unable to switch off a machine it only
half understands. It has become the sorcerer's apprentice of privatisation.
What it cannot sell - schools, say, or hospitals or police authorities - it
attempts to insulate from local democratic control. Self-perpetuating
boards, well hidden from disturbing influences such as the voters, take
over. The command lines lead back to Whitehall.
It is not done very well. When the prime minister was in a particularly deep
hole last summer the cabinet decided to restrict the 1993-94 programme of
new bills to what was politically uncontroversial and likely to be popular.
Those responsible for getting the business through - the chief whip, Mr
Richard Ryder, the leader of the House of Commons, Mr Tony Newton, and the
leader of the Lords, Lord Wakeham - wanted even less. They argued for a
quiet life, a period of consolidation. This made political sense, since the
government's best hope lies in keeping very still while a rising economy
floats it back to acceptability. The actual programme chosen - with law and
order, education and deregulation to the fore - was a compromise. It is
clear from the squalls in the House of Lords that even as such it was too
much for parliament to swallow without gagging.
You cannot conclude from the above exposition that Labour has the answers.
It doesn't. It might produce some mild constitutional change but, in terms
of a fresh philosophy or even specific ideas the people's party has little
to offer. Instead of using its present term of opposition as the Tories
would, namely to refresh itself, it has become cataleptic. Its sole merit as
a potential party of government is that it has not been discredited by
appearing to rot after too long a period in office. This is not good enough.
It looks as if it is preparing to ask us to vote for it in 1996 on the
single argument that the Tories have been in for 17 years and that it is
only fair for Buggins's crew to be given a chance. Labour should be careful.
Many voters will gag at that too.
In short, we cannot be certain that we will see the back of either Mr Major
or his government, even after the next election. Disenchantment today does
not mean relief tomorrow. We know what Labour's selling point will be. The
Tories, broken-down, discredited and exhausted, might yet top it, if the
vote comes on the crest of a boom, following a tax cut, and after a campaign
that exposes the emptiness of the alternative.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Personal View: Experiment in democracy - The explosive
growth of US mutual funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the modern era, industrial countries have typically organised their
financial systems around either a universal banking model encompassing many
financial services or a hybrid structure that separates commercial and
investment banking. The US is now creating a new system, in which mutual
funds are overtaking banks as the main repositories of household wealth and
suppliers of capital to small and medium-sized companies.
The US mutual fund industry now has about Dollars 2,000bn in assets, equal
to about 85 per cent of bank deposits, against barely 10 per cent in the
early 1980s. The industry has about Dollars 670bn in equities and Dollars
760bn in taxable and non-taxable bonds, plus Dollars 580bn in money market
funds. This asset growth has been matched by a large expansion in mutual
fund shareholding - 28 per cent of US households own a mutual fund, against
6 per cent in 1980.
Behind this expansion has lain an accommodating monetary policy designed to
rescue American banks from a sharp rise in non-performing real estate loans.
This policy has enabled banks to bolster lending margins, earn healthy
profits from long-term government bonds and restore their equity/asset
ratios to the highest level since the early 1960s. But low money market
yields and a positive yield curve have also encouraged households to shift
savings from banks into higher-yielding instruments, such as mutual funds.
So far the consequences have been benign. First, mutual fund growth has
provided a new channel for monetary policy to buoy the economy by broadening
the number of households able to benefit from rising bond and equity prices.
Appreciation of financial asset prices has been one of the main transmission
mechanisms employed by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to revive
the economy.
Second, the mutual fund boom has helped facilitate an expansion of
securitised forms of credit at a time when commercial banks have pursued
more conservative lending policies. During 1993, there were 571
non-financial initial public offerings in the US stock market, raising about
Dollars 25bn, against 447 worth Dollars 19.4bn in 1992, 330 (Dollars 13.8bn)
in 1991, and 150 (Dollars 4.2bn) in 1990. The search for higher yields has
also revitalised the so-called 'junk bond market'. In 1993, Wall Street sold
about Dollars 57bn of non-investment grade bonds, against Dollars 42bn in
1992, Dollars 17bn in 1991 and Dollars 2.9bn in 1990. These developments
have improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium-sized
companies, helping to spur faster employment growth.
Although the mutual fund boom had positive economic side-effects in 1993,
the extent of current changes in US household savings flows raises questions
about regulatory policy and stability in the financial markets.
The first concern is: what will happen to retail savings flows and household
wealth when interest rates rise and share prices fall?
The household sector is vulnerable to losses from declining asset prices if
interest rates rise sharply. In 1993, bond and equity mutual fund assets
were equal to 15.6 per cent of discretionary household financial assets,
against 3.8 per cent in 1985. This growth in bond and mutual fund portfolios
has been partially offset by a large fall in direct household holdings of
equities - from 46 per cent of discretionary financial assets in the early
1970s to 27 per cent last year. As a result, the household sector's total
holdings of financial assets, potentially subject to sharp price
fluctuations, has not risen to new highs but returned to levels close to the
early 1970s peak.
The second set of issues raised by the mutual fund boom centres on
government supervision of the financial system. The government has
traditionally required the commercial banking sector to ensure capital
adequacy and promote various social objectives. But in mutual fund
regulation, its main aim has been to promote adequate disclosure so
consumers can decide if a product suits them; it has not tried to impose
social investment guidelines or capital adequacy rules. Hence, bankers
complain the government is pursuing asymmetrical regulatory policies just as
there is shrinkage in some traditional areas of their business.
This problem may resolve itself via banks entering the mutual funds business
and the creation of a two-tier government deposit insurance system. It would
provide guarantees for only a core of low-yield deposits invested in safe
assets, such as Treasury securities, while deposits in riskier assets would
be uninsured. US banks already have nearly Dollars 180bn of mutual fund
assets under their control.
The final consequence of the mutual fund boom could be a change in the
ownership of corporate America and in popular perceptions of capitalism. The
main factor driving recent mutual fund growth has been low interest rates.
But the industry has also benefited from changes in the way Americans save
for retirement. While defined benefit pension plans used to dominate these
savings, there is a shift now to defined contribution plans. These enable
participants to allocate savings between a variety of mutual funds. Defined
contribution plans are already equal to 90 per cent of defined benefit
plans, up from 52 per cent in 1985.
Peter Drucker, writer and economic consultant, argued in his book The Unseen
Revolution in 1976 that the US was evolving towards a pension fund form of
socialism, in which retirement plans would own most US industry and alter
worker attitudes towards business. But his argument was misdirected because
defined benefit plans, which then prevailed, offered workers guaranteed
returns, not the right to choose between funds with divergent returns.
Today, retirement plans are expanding their ownership of the stock market
but not producing a form of pension fund socialism. The US is, instead,
embarking upon a new experiment in the democratisation of bond and equity
ownership through a mixture of mutual funds, defined contribution pension
plans and direct ownership of securities.
US politicians have not yet fully grasped the significance of this
development because financial markets have been in a bull mode for the past
three years. But by the next presidential election in 1996, the performance
of the bond and stock markets could be important political variables than
ever before. Ironically the great economic risk facing the Clinton
administration is not that real annual GDP growth will return to a sluggish
pace which leaves unemployment unchanged. Rather it is that the US now
experiences an economic upturn so robust thatinterest rates have to rise
sharply, puncturing the post-1991 bull market in stocks and bonds.
How can Clinton avoid this danger? The best option would be to engineer a
mid-term stock market correction via higher interest rates in late 1994 or
1995, setting the stage for a new bull market in 1996.
This is an edited version of a paper presented at the Davos World Economic
Forum by the author, chief economist of Kemper Financial Companies

FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advisers in favour of regulation, not
PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P L TANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to your article, 'Squabble may spoil life's ambition'
(January 26), your readers may be intrigued to learn that at a large meeting
of members of Countrywide Independent Advisers last week there was almost
100 per cent support for statutory regulation rather than the Personal
Investment Authority.
The primary objection was that the constitution of the proposed board is
seen to favour public interest groups; put another way, self-regulation is
no longer self-regulation.
What is interesting is that these are independent financial advisers
speaking. IFAs are not normally known for expressing views in favour of any
sort of regulation, let alone statutory regulation. But IFAs have come a
long way. Like others they see the proliferation of different regulators for
different parts of the personal investment sector to have been a signal
failure of the Financial Services Act and welcome the rationalisation
proposed.
Regulation is good for IFAs. It has very positive marketing advantages. IFAs
are in favour of a single regulatory body with status, stature and teeth.
Who better than the government? Government will be fairer than the PIA as
proposed.
Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, thinks it would be a waste of effort and
resources if the PIA were not now to proceed. Surely this is not so. The
cumulative experience in getting us thus far would be absorbed by
government. Many of the people involved would be available to government. It
is a nonsense to imply that government would be starting afresh.
Furthermore, if all the PIA has done is to crystallise thinking, it will
have been worth it. P L Tann,

FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions view challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D J PARRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Commenting on Marks and Spencer's move into personal pensions, Lex
writes (February 2): 'The mass market may be better served by a standardised
M&amp;S financial product than the inappropriate personal pensions many have
thus far been sold.' Why? Is he implying that M&amp;S's in-house pension quality
will be as good as its knitwear? The M&amp;S unit trust performance figures
hardly support that idea.
Or is he implying that the strictly salaried salesforce will not use any of
the usual selling techniques? Does he seriously believe that the salesforce
will be free from all pressures of individual sales targets imposed by
management?
Your writers above all should know that independent financial advisers alone
can provide informed and impartial advice across the whole of the pensions
spectrum.
Moreover, we are required by law to assess the whole of the marketplace when
advising each individual. M&amp;S salesmen will, of course, be free from any
such commercially onerous duty.
What makes Lex think that M&amp;S financial products sold by its staff are, or
will be, any whit less 'inappropriate' than those sold by any other tied
salesforce?

FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Level of bank's doubtful loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LINO BENASSI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'BCI improves 1.8 per cent to L268bn' (January 27),
Robert Graham says: 'The proportion of doubtful loans in BCI's portfolio
rose to 3.3 per cent from 2.9 per cent - but this was almost the average
percentage for the Italian banking system.' Although the figures are correct
for BCI's domestic loans (the figures for all loans are 2.8 per cent in
1993, compared with 2 per cent in 1992), the comment comparing them with the
Italian banking system is misleading. In October 1993 (the most recent date
for which figures are available), BCI's doubtful loans were actually around
half the level of those for the Italian banking system as a whole, which
were 6.4 per cent, compared with 5.7 per cent in 1992.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: M&amp;G share scheme criticism
unjustified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr L E LINAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The M&amp;G Group's proposal for renewing its executive share option scheme
has attracted a certain amount of interest and ill-informed comment from
some quarters because it does not conform in one respect to the joint
guidelines of the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association
of British Insurers.
We are firmly of the view that performance benchmarks for the exercise of
options may not be in the best interests of shareholders. In fact, the
guidelines themselves acknowledge the difficulties of prescribing a
measurement of performance and have sidestepped the issue by passing
responsibility to the remuneration committees of public companies.
M&amp;G has always been a strong supporter of employee share schemes as they
provide a powerful motivation for management. We like the identity of
interests between executives and their shareholders which options
particularly provide and we like to see executives' interest in option
shares held long-term. Furthermore, we like to see options dribbled out in
relatively small amounts over a period of years.
Not only do we consider that the application of guidelines is inappropriate
for the management of our own business, but we feel that they are misguided
in respect of a broad range of British companies.
M&amp;G has substantial investments in a large number of medium and small
companies in a wide range of industries. We believe it is impracticable to
introduce fair benchmarks for these companies in all their different
circumstances at a time when the process of establishing the role and
responsibility of remuneration committees is in its early stages.
Remuneration committees should focus on the effectiveness of the executive
directors and on their individual contributions. Options and, indeed, their
packages should be reviewed in this light.
Our main concerns regarding benchmarks are:
1. There is a danger they could influence management to act in their own
short-term interests rather than in the long-term interests of the company.
They could, therefore, lead to a conflict of interest.
2. We would argue that, just because a company has, over a given period,
performed below some performance yardstick, this is no guarantee that
management has not worked hard and, indeed, performed well in the
circumstances. In periods of recession manufacturing companies in particular
will find it difficult to meet many benchmarks.
The recent recession, which has had a very severe impact on the financial
performance of many well-managed companies, illustrates this point vividly.
3. Benchmarks may tend to encourage executives to exercise their options
earlier for fear of being locked out at a later date. We would much prefer
and, indeed, encourage management to retain their interests in their company
for as long as possible.
4. It is extremely difficult to arrive at a satisfactory benchmark. A
benchmark tied to earnings would seem to be most inappropriate and we have
all seen how earnings per share can be manipulated through changes in
accounting procedures. Benchmarks tied to relative performance against the
index or sub-section of the index are again full of difficulties.
5. There is a real danger that some companies, in their search for
benchmarks, will choose guidelines that are too demanding and which will
result in unwise corporate strategies being pursued, for example Burton.
At M&amp;G we are proud to have played a leading role in the development of good
corporate governance over the past 30 years and we shall continue to speak
out with an independent voice on what we consider to be in the best
interests of British industry. There is no such thing as a perfect share
option scheme but we believe that benchmarks will create more problems than
they solve.
The NAPF, in its effort to eliminate unearned reward in a few cases, is in
serious danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: Der Rosenkavalier - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there any opera that reeks more of nostalgia than Der Rosenkavalier? As
the waltzes begin to play, it is difficult to resist Strauss's blandishments
to cast one's mind back over the years.
The first production of the opera at the London Coliseum was almost 20 years
ago in January 1976. It marked a turning-point in the fortunes of English
National Opera. The company had recently adopted its new name and was
struggling to rebuild after a damaging strike that had torn morale to shreds
and left the theatre closed for six weeks. Headlines such as 'NATKE members
stage mid-performance walk-out' tell their own story. How times change]
Now, two decades on, Der Rosenkavalier is back. And again ENO stands at a
cross-roads. The all-powerful triumvirate that ruled for over a decade has
departed, while the newcomers have not yet had time to put their stamp on
policy. They are probably right that the old production of the opera had had
its day. This replacement may not surpass or even equal it in some respects,
but that does not necessarily mean that the company is heading downhill.
If memory serves, the ENO orchestra plays a good deal better than it used
to. Given that Der Rosenkavalier is such a lofty summit for a company to
climb, it is surprising that Sian Edwards, the new Music Director, is not in
charge. Yakov Kreizberg, a guest conductor of noted promise elsewhere, must
take credit for the best features of the playing, but he does let the opera
drag. The opening prelude, an explicit depiction of a night of passion, set
out without thrust or energy, as though Octavian was half-hearted about
getting on the job. The final act drooped way before the climax.
To some degree that is reflected on stage. As in his first production for
ENO (The Marriage of Figaro) Jonathan Miller is more interested in observing
the period social decorum on the surface than releasing the passions that
burn below.
The period that he gives us here is not the 18th-century reign of Maria
Theresa intended by Strauss and Hofmannsthal, but the Edwardian era of
Upstairs, Downstairs. By this time Vienna was in decline, which Miller
evidently feels is more appropriate to Strauss's decadent music. Among the
phantoms in the Act 3 charade is a first world war soldier, looming
ominously over the comedy below.
There is no Rococo finery left in the Marschallin's bedroom. Its walls are
bare, the furniture sparse, not even a clock for her to stop during the
night. It is surprising to find breakfast still served by little black
Mahomet. This can be a passionate scene with Octavian rolling on the
Marschallin's lap, but not here. He just gives her a peck on the cheek - a
shame, as Sally Burgess's self-confident Octavian, a naughty-looking boy
with a cheeky smile, would surely demand more.
Everything she does would be really involving, if only the top notes did not
glare so.
For the second act we move to the most impressive of Peter J. Davison's
sets, a rather modern-day nouveau riche mansion, adorned outside by a
splendidly vulgar line of huge, bronze, mock-classical statues. In the hall
Rosemary Joshua's Sophie, a shallow girl without a lot of charm, awaits her
husband-to-be. What she gets is the exhausting, larger-than-life Baron Ochs
of John Tomlinson, a lecherous county squire, who is forever stalking his
prey.
Joshua was nervous for the Presentation of the Rose, but found her silvery
top notes later; Tomlinson was relentlessly loud, but made every word of
Ochs's long role clear - a major bonus.
Among the large cast Christopher Booth-Jones was a no-nonsense Faninal
(Miller excises much of the traditional comic business, though without
putting anything in its place). Claire Powell and Nicholas Buxton turned the
Italian intriguers into a very highly coloured pair. Peter Bronder sang the
Italian tenor without overt parody. It was good to see Eric Shilling, an ENO
old-timer, back as the Notary.
More important, it was good to hear again Anne Evans, who sang the role of
the Marschallin in that previous production two decades ago. I happen to
believe that the Marschallin is younger in spirit than she makes her, not so
defeatist in her outlook on life and love, but that may be because
Kreizberg's slow speeds introduced a mood of moroseness into her scenes,
also sometimes dragging her down in pitch. The dignity of her portrayal is
happily remembered from before, its heartfelt warmth and sincerity, too.
Since 1976 Evans has gone forth to take her place on the international
stage, Tomlinson too, both of them notably at Bayreuth. It is a mark of what
has happened at ENO that it can now field a world-class Brunnhilde and Wotan
in the cast. Expectations are higher these days and that means that a
middling achievement like this Rosenkavalier can come as a disappointment.
Perhaps, in fact, we should be counting ourselves lucky.
Performances continue until March 16

FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: One Day Tradition - New music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under that opaque label, London New Music is presenting four concerts in the
Lilian Baylis Theatre. Each is devoted to a pair of 'contemporary'
composers, not necessarily alive: the opening concert included the American
avant-gardist Henry Cowell, long dead. I went to the second concert on
Wednesday, because it included music by Wolfgang von Schweinitz, German, and
41 next Monday.
Four years ago I wrote about the Munich Biennale premiere of his Patmos, a
very long opera on the complete text of St. John's Revelations in the
Lutheran version. Parts of the Munich audience were predictably outraged by
Ruth Berghaus's staging, studded with echoes of the Holocaust. I thought
Schweinitz's score impressively rich and varied; so I wanted to hear more.
Sadly, the LNM concert proved to be one of those bitty affairs that
'contemporary music' fans know too well. The programme is confined by its
budget to modest-scale works (some of which will be cancelled at the last
moment), and because few contemporary pieces stick to standard ensembles a
large part of the running-time will go towards carrying chairs and music
stands off the stage and on again.
In the event, we heard only the last of Schweinitz's promised three Etudes
from 1984, uncertainly delivered by LNM's pianist-conductor Michael Blake.
One could hear why he chose not to play the other, more difficult Etudes,
but this third one lost much of its effect without its contrasted siblings.
With Blake finger-strumming directly upon the piano strings, the soprano
Beth Griffith warbled engagingly through 'Sehr kleine Drachen' (1992). We
could not tell whether the words lived up to the promising title ('very
small dragons'), nor whether the music lived up to them, for they were
largely inaudible.
Much the most rewarding was his String Trio from 1978. A piece of
disillusioned romantic rebellion: frail, heartfelt echoes of Schumann and
Brahms are regularly deflated by ruthlessly sinking pitch. Amidst the
flamboyant decay, enough lyrical structure survives to carry a sharp,
regretful point.
The second half was given over to Gerald Barry, an Irish composer who enjoys
more of a cult following on the Continent than here. His music sounds like
the work of an intelligent composer who is so anxious not to trade upon any
established musical modes that he leaves himself room for little more than
carefully uncommitted, repetitious tootling. Only his recent Triorchic Blues
traced a feisty little vein of its own, in the violinist Charles Mutter's
expert hands: laconic, tautly syncopated, dryly witty. We could do with
more.

There are trios of programmes on both BBC2 and C4 tonight which, though not
compelling, are tempting. At 9.00 BBC2 shows the fifth episode in its re-run
of the first series of Red Dwarf, which satirises all those deep-space
movies from Star Wars to Alien. That is followed by Further Abroad, the last
in Jonathan Meades' hilarious series that folds architecture into social
observation. This week's subject is Belgium (9.30). Then comes a repeat of
Blackadder II in which Miranda Richardson gives an unforgettable portrayal
of Elizabeth I as a mischievous eight-year-old (10.00). Two repeats, but
good repeats, and one wholly original programme.
At 9.30 C4 shows the first episode in a new American comedy, Home
Improvement, which seems to have a doubtful basis for an entire series (a
DIY obsessive whose home 'improvements' always go wrong). That is followed
(10.00) by Roseanne, which makes some people laugh. Then (10.30) comes the
extraordinary series The Unpleasant World Of Penn &amp; Teller, also American,
which blows the gaff on conjuring.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: Dead Funny - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a good week for British comedy. After John Godber's April in
Paris at the Ambassadors comes the premiere of Terry Johnson's Dead Funny at
the Hampstead Theatre.
Johnson is becoming a prolific playwright. Hysteria, his piece about Sigmund
Freud and Salvador Dali, was shown at the Royal Court only last autumn. Dead
Funny is more down to earth. Although Freud is still mentioned and medical
science is never far away, this is a play about relatively normal people in
Islington, 1992.
Richard, a handsome consultant obstetrician, returns late for dinner, having
performed five hysterectomies in the course of the day and stopped in the
pub on the way back. He is not drunk, just nervous, for it is Wednesday -
the night for sex therapy at home.
However good Richard may be as a surgeon, he has come to find his slightly
older wife (41 to his 38) physically repellant. Tonight the therapy may be
working. A naked Richard lies reluctantly on the floor while his wife tries
to stir him. Then the doorbell rings and in comes a neighbour, Brian, to
announce that Benny Hill, the comedian, is dead.
I shan't go on with the plot except to say that in parts of Islington -
clearly a classless society - the news is quite as shocking as (say) the
death of the Queen Mother. Richard is a leading light in the Dead Funny
Society, which reveres a long line of stand-up British comics: Jimmy James,
Max Wall, Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd - the lot.
The rest of the play is about how - appropriately - to pay tribute to Benny.
In the course of it, the sexual hang-ups of his admirers emerge. There are
only five characters on stage. The sole non-admirer is Richard's wife,
Eleanor, played by Zoe Wanamaker.
Ms Wanamaker is a wonderful actress. She personifies sexual frustration
without the slightest inhibition. Her eyes can be fierce: she can exude
venom with the tiniest movement of a nostril. Sometimes she looks as if she
has developed a technique of conveying a whole facial expression from the
top of her nose. She can also smile with a tear in her eye. This is a
marvellously disciplined performance, even though - perhaps to tip the
balance in favour of the Dead Funny Society - she does not always have the
best lines.
The other outstanding performance, the full extent of which is held back
until after the interval, is Niall Buggy's Brian. In Act 1 he is bumbling,
officious, fussy lower class camp. In Act 2 he comes out. 'Benny,' he
announces, 'was gay - and so am I' He has bought a ticket to Amsterdam to
celebrate, but tears it up and ends consoling Eleanor. What they both want,
they say, is 'a nice young man, preferably virile, possibly the same one'.
There are additional delights in the plot. A defect is that, as in Hysteria,
Johnson is not always sure what genre he is working in. He moves into farce
and out of it for no obvious reason. But Dead Funny is bursting with life.
Johnson directs, and the excellent set is designed by Sue Plummer.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: A history lesson in contemporary paint - Two
intelligent exhibitions which claim for art a conscious political and social
position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two stimulating London shows complement each other neatly, perhaps because
each is the work of that very smart curator, Maureen Paley. In Symptoms of
Interference, Conditions of Possibility at the Camden Arts Centre, she has
brought together work by Ad Reinhardt, Joseph Kosuth and Felix
Gonzalez-Torres, offering a history lesson which provides a valuable
foundation from that to explore Wall to Wall, a three-venue show of wall
painted works that opens at the Serpentine Gallery.
The Camden show illustrates the interrelation between three generations of
radical American artists. In the two years before his death in 1967, Ad
Reinhardt, America's first purely abstract artist, famous for his 'Black
Paintings', met Joseph Kosuth, born in 1947 and one of the first conceptual
artists, who acknowledged his formative influence just as Felix
Gonzalez-Torres, born in 1957 and too young to have known Reinhardt,
acknowledges that of both.
All three share a belief in the power of art to make profound, and
profoundly political, statements. Ad Reinhardt's was the dissenting voice as
abstract expressionism triumphed in the US after the war, arguing that art
should be generated in and of itself, following its own laws and disdaining
the pressures of the market. Reinhardt's intellectual purism was grounded in
political radicalism: during the 1940s, he drew cartoons for the socialist
publications The New Masses and PM. 'People are blocked from understanding
and enjoying modern art because someone, somewhere, got the notion that an
'artist' was a 'picture maker'', the cartoon entitled 'How to look at an
artist', drawn for PM in 1946, declares.
He proved his point with the 'Black Paintings', three of which, from 1953,
1962 and 1966, are shown. Here are 'pictures' of nothing, their beauty the
delicate interplay of black against black.
For Kosuth, life was more complicated. The relative simplicity of
Reinhardt's oppositional stance was no longer effective in the 1960s against
an art market capable of transforming the most radical art into desirable
commodities. Kosuth began to experiment with ways of making the questioning
of the artistic process part of the way an art work is perceived. He began
to make art out of words.
Simple at first, photocopied extracts from dictionaries, for example, the
works became more and more complicated, the range of source material
spreading from philosophy to the popular press. At Camden, Kosuth shows 'the
Thing in-it-self is found in its Truth through the loss of its immediacy' an
installation made with blown up photographs of newspaper clippings. First
shown at Leo Castelli in New York last year, it has been reworked to include
texts from English newspapers, hung head high around a room, juxtaposed with
cartoons, photographs and quotations from Kafka.
Walking into a room lined with words and blurry blown up newsprint images,
the effect is surreal: their increased scale and careful grouping demand a
more searching scrutiny than the swift scan that is their usual lot.
Now, the crazy cast, which could have been dismissed with an uncomfortable
glance as the page was turned (dead drunk Serbian snipers, Lorena Bobbit the
penis severer, Boy George in a hat adorned with horns shaking hands with
Yitzhak Shamir), gaze out in silent witness that meaning is something that
must be constructed, not simply as-sumed.
Gonzalez-Torres has the lightest touch. His politics seem more personal, his
inclusion of the audience more gentle - he piles up sweets on the gallery
floor in 'Untitled (Public Opinion)' and invites them to help themselves,
stacks blank black photocopies in a pile and calls it 'Party Platform',
makes small, black, pictures-with-words like miniature Kosuths where names
and dates - Pol Pot 1975, Prague 1968, Robocop 1987 - wait for the viewer to
make the connection, the human response that brings the meaning alive.
The spectator is also required to be alert at the Serpentine, where in Wall
to Wall the most successful pieces work like installations, making the
fullest use of the space. Lothar Baumgarten's 'Imago Mundi', 1988-89, is
best, a political message about the effects of colonialism on the perception
of other cultures spread across the elegant entrance hall in juxtaposed
names of countries and colours. Michael Craig Martin overwhelms with his
wonderful colour, the solitary, carefully painted everyday objects - chair,
filing cabinet, book - seeming to hover before their separate walls of vivid
blue, green or pink. The rest are weaker stuff, both in concept and
execution.
Neither show is easy, and each is of the kind - subtle, cerebral, serious in
purpose, claiming for art a conscious and engaged social position - now so
readily mocked.
Tough old Ad Reinhardt, best of the lot, knew how to deal with that sort of
thing. One of his cartoons shown at Camden includes two cherubs in
conversation. The first says, 'I don't know anything about art but I know
what I like.' The second replies, 'Yes, isn't it nice that the obligation to
be intelligent doesn't extend to the field of art.' That's telling them, Ad.

FT  04 FEB 94 / People: Former consultant takes top job at client
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailing group Kingfisher has appointed Tim Breene (right), currently
global marketing director at Guinness's spirits division United Distillers,
as strategy and international development director.
Breene, 44, has known Kingfisher for some time; he worked with it as a
consultant for McKinsey in the mid-1980s, and was involved in Kingfisher's
defence against the unsuccessful takeover bid by electrical retailer Dixons
in 1990.
He joined United Distillers in 1991 as European marketing director, working
under Crispin Davis, then global marketing director. When Davis was promoted
to managing director, Breene succeeded him, and the two developed a close
working relationship before Davis resigned last October after differences
with Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive.
UD says it is sorry to lose Breene, but understands he could not refuse the
opportunity of a board position with a major public company.
It adds that Breene helped steer the company through a very difficult time
in the distilling industry, and was responsible for two very successful
marketing campaigns in the US for Johnny Walker and Dewar's whisky.
At Kingfisher, Breene will be responsible for formulating strategies for the
group, as well as for its individual businesses, and seeking out
international opportunities - although Kingfisher, which took over French
electrical retailer Darty last year, says Breene's appointment does not
signal that it has its sights on another imminent overseas acquisition.
Breene began his career in 1971 as a senior brand manager with Unilever,
before joining Mars as marketing manager from 1975 to 1978. He then joined
McKinsey as a consultant partner until 1986 before being appointed chief
executive of ad agency WCRS. From 1990 to 1991 he was vice-president and
director of Boston Consulting Group.
He will be succeeded at UD by Ian Meakins, 37, who has headed the company's
joint venture with Greek wine maker Boutari since 1992. He joined UD in 1991
as marketing director for white spirits and new brand development, having
previously worked for seven years as a brand and production manager for
Procter &amp; Gamble, and then as a consultant with Bain before becoming a
founding partner in the Calchas consultancy.
Meakins is credited with helping to make Johnny Walker and Dewar's the most
popular whiskies in Greece, where Scotch has become the national drink,
outselling Ouzo by 40 per cent.

FT  04 FEB 94 / People: CentreGold entices player from Sega
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CentreGold, the Birmingham-based publisher and distributor of electronic
computer games which was floated in October 1993, has notched up something
of a coup in the software entertainment world by tempting a player from
Japanese games giant Sega.
Nobuhiko Ishihara, 42, is leaving his post as general manager with Sega
Enterprises to become right-hand man of CentreGold's chief executive, Geoff
Brown. Ishihara was a key figure in Sega's successful campaign to win hearts
and minds of children across Europe. He joined Sega from an NEC subsidiary
in 1987; in August 1990 he came to Europe where he successfully established
a consumer division, including building a European research and development
programme.
Working closely with Sega's president and chief executive, Ishihara was
responsible for licensing property rights (both into and from Sega) and for
the establishment of a third party publishing programme in north America and
Europe.
CentreGold has thus recruited a senior figure with ready access into the
nerve centre of one of the world's biggest computer games manufacturers.
Moreover, with imminent technological developments that will greatly expand
the entertainment software market, CentreGold sees the appointment as giving
it an extra dimension of market knowledge and strategic planning.

Water reduces pollution and waste disposal problems, but can cause problems

Danfoss, based at Nordborg, believes its range of water-based hydraulics,
which includes a hydraulic motor, will be especially suitable where hygiene

<TEXT>
A breakthrough in electro-mechanical technology could soon enable people to
simulate surfing, skiing or even hang gliding in the privacy of an arcade
booth.
The 'virtual motion' system, developed in Dorset by Denne Developments,
replaces traditional mechanical hydraulics with computer-controlled pistons.
Sensors in the 'ski' or 'surf' board measure when the would-be athlete puts
pressure on the board. The computer then sends instructions to a host of
copper coils, which line a series of copper cylinders. Inside the cylinders
are pistons that have powerful magnets along their length. When the
electrical pulses activate the copper coils, the magnets react, shifting the
pistons and so the board. The whole ensemble is finished off with a virtual
reality headset. Denne Developments: UK, 0202 861661.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Trouble-free shirt all sewn up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese technology is on the way to developing what must be the world's
most trouble-free shirt, writes William Dawkins.
Sanyo Shokai, a clothing company, and Bridgestone, the tyre producer, have
developed an all but indestructible method of fixing buttons to clothes.
The technique, due in shops for the autumn, comes hot on the heels of the
'memory' shirt that automatically holds its wrinkle-free shape after
washing.
The key to Sanyo Shokai's button treatment is a dab of clear urethane resin
on the threads. The flexible resin seeps into the fibres and hardens, making
the stitches almost indestructible. The cost is tiny: between Y2 (1p) and Y3
per button.
At first, Sanyo Shokai plans to use the treatment for heavy-duty buttons on
suits and coats. But the logical next step, unpopable buttons on 'memory'
shirts, cannot be far away. Sanyo Shokai: Japan, 03 3357 4111.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology: Clean sweep in the sky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MAX GLASKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laser beams will soon sweep the skies above Berlin to check if the air is
fresh. Pollution will be mapped in three dimensions every half-hour by a
DM1.5m (Pounds 570,000) laser radar system. It will identify the source of
the pollution and trace its path through the atmosphere.
The first permanent lidar (light detection and ranging) system for
monitoring pollution was installed in Leipzig, east Germany, two years ago
to map emissions from industry, electricity generators and traffic. By
correlating the data with meteorological information, smog levels can be
predicted. The maps reveal the sources of the worst pollution.
The lidar, called a Lasair 420S, is a titanium sapphire pulsed laser that
emits two beams of different wavelengths. One is tuned to scatter when it
encounters specific pollutants; the other is used as a reference. The
difference between the scatter of the beams indicates the quantity of
pollutant and the echo time reveals its location.
The back-scattered laser light is collected through a telescope and focused
on to a photodetector. Software interprets the data and produces two- and
three- dimensional profiles of the pollution. Typically, they show
concentrations of sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide
and dust at heights up to 800m above ground level.
The equipment, which fits into a 3m cube and has a range of up to 12km,
detects nitrogen oxide levels as low as 2 parts per billion (ppb) and
sulphur dioxide concentrations as high as 270 ppb. A system will be sited on
the roof of a Berlin hospital by the spring; a smaller, mobile version
started trials in December.
Conventional techniques for monitoring air pollution only take spot
measurements above ground. 'They fail to represent pollution correctly, even
if the chemical monitors are located close together because pollution varies
drastically within cities,' says Nicolas Adolph, sales manager of Elight
Laser, Lasair's German manufacturer. 'We can make remote measurements over
several kilometres without the need to take samples.'

definitive proposal for reforming the council has been prepared.
The council is the umbrella body for the UK's professional engineering
institutions. Last year, Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the council,
unveiled controversial proposals for a new relationship with the 42
professional institutions. The council said in December that Sir John would
serve a second three-year term as chairman, beginning this May.
Denis Filer is also to become chairman of ADWEST GROUP from April when Fred
Grant retires. Graham Menzies, group md, then becomes chief executive and
Richard Truscott, general manager operations for the past three years, joins
the board.

<TEXT>
Paul Torday, 47, grandson of the founder of Newcastle engineers TORDAY &amp;
CARLISLE, is bowing out after more than a decade at the helm of a company he
joined over 20 years ago.
The company, which lost Pounds 13m in its last financial year and is not
paying a dividend, refused to comment on the reasons for Torday's impending
departure. However, there have been reports of growing institutional
pressure for boardroom changes.
Torday's decision to quit the company when a new chief executive is found
comes less than a month after the resignation of two of the company's three
non-executive directors, Sir Michael Carlisle and Michael Denny. The company
has appointed three executives, David Batie, Mike Hennon and Menno van der
Hulst from DMI, its core business, to the main board and says that it also
wants to appoint two non-executive directors.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology: Brown coal with green appeal - Despite a lack of
resources, an east German institute has developed a clean briquette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Years of research are finally paying off for the Mining Academy of Freiberg,
in the east German state of Saxony: its Institute for Agglomeration and Air
Pollution is scheduled to mass-produce an environmentally friendly brown
coal briquette.
Not all east Germans can take the invention seriously. 'You're telling me
that a 'green' lignite briquette exists?' says Jochen Hofer, a former miner.
'I know all about the lignite. The dirty, dusty air. We inhaled the stuff
for more than 40 years, and we burned the stuff in our homes.'
Wolfgang Naundorf, head of the institute, is not surprised by such
descriptions: 'Precisely because lignite is so dusty and contains such a
high level of sulphuric acid, we began research on inventing the green
briquette during the 1980s because we wanted to have clean air.'
At first, the experiments were haphazard. This was largely because the
former communist authorities in east Germany had no inclination to fund
research that might slow down production of brown coal. Until unification,
brown coal accounted for more than 85 per cent of primary energy consumption
in the five east states.
'We got no financing or support for our research. We did it as a purely
academic exercise,' says Naundorf. Despite the lack of resources and modern
equipment, the institute persevered.
Ralph Wallenberg, one of the scientists involved in the research, explains
how, after many attempts, they found the successful formula. They added 3.5g
of calcium hydrate (a combination of lime, chalk and gypsum) to every 100g
of raw lignite. The calcium hydrate was mixed with the lignite as a
suspension in water.
The added calcium compounds reduced sulphuric acid emissions when the
briquettes were burnt but had the disadvantage of weakening their structure.
The researchers hardened the briquettes again by adding some pulverised
hard-coal coke, or anthracite.
'The sulphuric acid emissions have been reduced from 3 per cent to 0.5 per
cent and the calorific, or heating content, has been increased by between 5
and 10 per cent,' says Wallenberg.
The institute could not have continued its research had it not received a
contract last year from the giant Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle (Mibrag) lignite
fields, which straddle the states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, and which
were being sold to an Anglo-American consortium led by Britain's PowerGen
and NRG of the US. 'After much discussion, the consortium, although pretty
sceptical about their value, decided to keep two of Mibrag's
briquette-producing factories open,' says Johann Neudert, head of one of
Mibrag's engineering departments.
Naundorf says: 'We had to work fast. On a dry coal basis, Mibrag has one of
the highest sulphuric acid contents in Germany. It is between 2.5 and 4 per
cent. Under European Union regulations, any solid fuels burned in
small-scale outlets, for instance for domestic heating, must be reduced to 1
per cent by January 1995, otherwise they must be closed down.' The contract
enabled the institute to complete its research successfully.
The institute's staff know that one contract will not secure their future.
At present, the state of Saxony provides a third of the institute's costs.
The remaining two-thirds has to be raised by the staff even though they have
had no previous experience of seeking research grants. Naundorf's small
research department has been reduced by 10 to 16 members.
The need to secure more contracts to raise financing is even more critical
because the academy is faced with probably the most serious crisis since its
foundation in 1765: the collapse of manufacturing, and the shortage of
students.
The closure of large heavy industry enterprises that used brown coal has
been followed by the rapid run-down of the region's mining sector. Since
1990, more than 100,000 mining jobs have been lost and primary consumption
of brown coal has plummeted from 91m tonnes in 1989 to less than 51m tonnes
in 1993.
The academy depended on the mining industry for its livelihood and very
existence. Since the 18th century, it has trained generations of geologists
and mining engineers, natural scientists and chemists.
'But now, we can hardly get enough students to fill the courses. The
industry has few jobs,' says Naundorf. Both the institute, set up in 1924 to
conduct research into the properties of lignite, and the academy are finding
it hard to pay staff. Morale is not high.
Wallenberg says one of the main drawbacks is equipment. 'We cannot buy new
equipment unless we win contracts. And if we don't win contracts, we can't
refine our experiments to win contracts or pay our salaries.'
Equipment notwithstanding, outsiders say they are struck by the academy's
innovative standards. 'The east German institutes do not have the
state-of-the-art when it comes to equipment, but the people in Freiberg and,
in my experience, east German scientists in general have the knowledge,'
says Michael Gillen, a mechanical engineer at the research department at
Bord na Mona, Ireland's largest peat and turf company.
'They have all this brainpower which previously they could not use to its
full potential. They compensated for the shortage of spare parts or new
equipment by becoming highly creative and innovative,' he added.
Bord na Mona recently contracted the institute to increase the durability
and water resistance of the Irish peat briquette. 'We might as well tap into
the huge fund of knowledge,' says Gillen. Selling that knowledge might
secure Freiberg's future.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Property: Securum looks to the Ark to stay afloat - The UK
disposal strategy adopted by Sweden's Securum Property Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securum Property Holdings is one of the most important new overseas players
in the UK property market. But, unlike other newcomers, its job is to sell,
not buy, commercial property.
The company was set up last November to liquidate the UK property assets
secured on loans made by Nordbanken, a Swedish bank that was the single
biggest casualty of the crisis in Sweden's banking system in the late 1980s.
Securum Property Holdings is a subsidiary of Securum, which was created by
the Swedish government in October 1992 to take over Nordbanken's portfolio
of SKr67bn in bad and doubtful loans. Securum's goal was 'to recover . . .
non-performing loans and loss exposures . . . by taking possession of the
underlying assets, assuming an active ownership role and creating future
growth in value'.
Securum's UK holdings, which make up its largest overseas operation, include
Bricom, an airport servicing and parcel delivery company; a hotel group that
operates seven hotels; and a finance subsidiary.
Property is the largest single component of the British holdings. It
accounts for 60 per cent of the loans made by Nordbanken for UK
acquisitions. These loans were originally valued at between Pounds 650m and
Pounds 700m but were written down to Pounds 380m at the end of 1992; the
decline in UK property values was a contributory factor.
Overseeing the refurbishment and possible sale of the UK properties is the
responsibility of Mr Phil Alexander, whose previous experience includes
dismantling parts of the failed Mountleigh and Rosehaugh property
portfolios.
Securum presents a special set of problems arising from its unique origins.
Moreover, there were additional legal complications relating to the bad loan
book. The UK portfolio includes 180 properties, developed by more than 100
individuals and spread throughout the country. The portfolio, which is
mainly split between offices (60 per cent), retail (9 per cent) and
industrial (27 per cent), includes some in prime locations, such as Bond
Street in central London. But many of the properties are in secondary
locations, largely because Nordbanken loaned to developers active at the end
of the last UK property cycle whose deals were often concentrated in fringe
areas.
One example in Securum's portfolio is its biggest single property, the Ark,
a striking, award-winning development built by Ake Larson Byggare, a Swedish
contractor, in Hammersmith, west London.
Bringing some coherence to this ragged portfolio is a priority for Securum
Property Holdings. 'At the moment we have a mish-mash of buildings. We are
trying to get some reasoning into our portfolio,' says Mr Alexander. 'We are
trying to build up a well-balanced portfolio,' he adds.
Mr Alexander's strategy is to sell the buildings that do not need, or do not
justify, a further expenditure of effort. Last year, Securum Property
Holdings sold properties totalling Pounds 34m. The biggest sale was the
57,000 sq ft Adelaide House in Chiswick, west London, which was bought by
Postel for about Pounds 15m. A similar value of property is due to be sold
this year.
Mr Alexander believes the remaining core of the portfolio has the potential
to increase in value. His initial goal is to reduce the vacancy rate from a
current high level in excess of 35 per cent to 10 per cent in the next 12
months. Much depends on finding tenants for the Ark, which accounts for 10
per cent of the portfolio by square footage. 'The key to achieving our
objective is to ensure lettings at the Ark,' says Mr Alexander.
In addition, Securum Property Holdings believes it can add value to its
properties by investing in them. For instance, one of the most disastrous
property loans made by Nordbanken in the UK was for an office development at
Kingston, Surrey. Today the development's value is less than a tenth of the
original Pounds 11m loan, largely the result of the developers contravening
planning permission by building without the agreed number of parking spaces.
But Securum Property Holdings believes the development will recoup some of
its losses with a further investment of Pounds 2m, by buying adjacent land,
building a car park and finding a tenant.
Mr Alexander's goal is to build up the UK portfolio to a core property group
worth Pounds 200m by 1995. He is determined to sell Securum Property
Holdings in its entirety. 'Selling off properties one by one is not the way
we can best add value,' he says. His plan is to sell the core portfolio by
1996, possibly through a flotation or reverse takeover. 'We want to round
off the strategy of adding value for the Swedish taxpayer,' he says.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Property: Overseas investment rises to Pounds 2.2bn on back
of low UK rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The changing opportunities and pressures facing overseas investors in UK
commercial property are highlighted in a report published this week by DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, chartered surveyors, writes Vanessa Houlder.
Overseas direct investment in property rose from Pounds 1.3bn in 1992 to
Pounds 2.2bn in 1993. German, Middle Eastern and south-east Asian investors
were the most prominent buyers to respond to the appeal of low UK interest
rates and sterling's devaluation.
A surprising feature of 1993 was the limited number of sales by overseas
investors, which totalled about Pounds 400m; 60 per cent of sales were by
Swedish and Japanese investors. Heavier selling had been anticipated by many
in the industry as a result of the difficult conditions in the main western
economies.
Most of the sales by Japanese property holders were accounted for by the
developer Kumagai Gumi, rather than institutions. In the case of several
Swedish property owners, the transfer of some bad loans to Securum reduced
the pressure to sell quickly.
Some of the problems experienced by overseas players in the late 1980s are
considered less likely to recur. The recent pattern of overseas investment
has seen a shift in emphasis away from acquisition for entrepreneurial or
development purposes, which predominated in the late 1980s, in favour of
standing investments that offer greater security of income.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Management: Throw out the old yardsticks - Building
societies need a better rating system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WELCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conventional wisdom has it that growing competition in the financial
services market will force building societies to adopt leaner and flatter
management structures. Those that do not will, as a result, have to merge
with more successful competitors.
However fashionable it may be, this line of argument misses the distinctive
management challenges facing building societies. Individual societies may
have fat to cut but the sector as a whole is already lean and getting
leaner. Many of the new challenges arise from the growing complexity of
their activities over the past decade:
Their core mortgage and deposit business has been overlaid with much greater
product differentiation.
They have become significant intermediaries in the sale of life and general
insurance, and a number have set up their own insurance operations.
Many large societies have diversified into new activities such as credit
cards, current accounts, unit trusts, estate agency and property
development. A small number have set up operations in continental Europe.
The real challenge facing societies' management is the move from a simple
two-product business to a complex multi-product group of businesses.
Applying a mutual ownership structure to this new environment adds to the
complexity.
At the heart of this exercise is the need for new ways to assess
organisational performance. Many traditional measures now give misleading
signals. Rising staffing levels or cost ratios may say more about a
society's changing business than about its operational efficiency. This
becomes clear if group performance, which includes subsidiary companies, is
compared with that of the society alone. Many of the new activities are
undertaken through subsidiaries of the society.
On this page last year two Northern Irish academics, Charlie Ferguson and
Donal McKillop, attached great importance to the finding that between 1989
and 1992 the number of head office and administrative staff of most large
societies increased by more than the number of branch staff ('A bureaucratic
legacy', November 5 1993). They cited this as evidence of lingering
bureaucracy.
But their finding begs the question about what has driven the increase. Take
the Alliance &amp; Leicester, which shows the largest jump in head-office and
administrative staff over the period. According to Ferguson and McKillop,
its headcount grew threefold from 1,815 employees in 1989 to 5,990 in 1992.
But most of this increase reflects the acquisition of Girobank in July 1990,
with its more labour-intensive portfolio of activities. Excluding Girobank
and other subsidiaries, Alliance &amp; Leicester's head-office and
administrative staff only increased by 200 between 1989 and 1992.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester's experience is indicative of the sector as a
whole. The value of assets per building society employee grew from Pounds
2.8m in 1989 to Pounds 3.7m in 1992, an increase of a third. Taking the most
comprehensive yardstick, societies' management expenses  - which cover staff
and other operating costs - fell from a low 1.22 per cent of their assets in
1989 to 1.07 per cent in 1992.
If the measures are recalculated to include the assets and staff of
subsidiaries, societies' organisational performance looks very different.
The value of assets per employee falls from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.9m.
Management expenses rise from 1.07 to 1.4 per cent of assets.
This does not tell us that societies' subsidiaries are more bureaucratic
than their core business nor that diversification has been unsuccessful;
only that traditional measures of organisational performance have become
less reliable. Total assets may be the wrong yardstick to measure the
staffing levels and cost structures of a building society whose activities
extend beyond mortgage lending.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Management: Time to walk the talk - New calls to reverse the
damaging proliferation of jargon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First there was management jargon. Now there is management jargon to
describe the management jargon. 'Corporate graffiti', the latest addition to
the language, is a derogatory term for a company's unthinking use of the
lingo. It is (literally) the catch-phrase to end all catch-phrases.
It is high time there was a backlash against this opaque, ugly and
cliche-ridden language. Action-centred leadership. Benchmarking.
Competences. Downsize. Empowerment. Globalisation. You can go through the
alphabet many times without exhausting the vocabulary of management-speak.
Open any management book and you may find yourself suffering from what is
known in the jargon as the 'mego' syndrome - my eyes glaze over.
'Corporate graffiti' has been coined by Tom Robertson, newly appointed
professor of marketing at London Business School. The notion came to him one
day when he was thumbing through annual reports of US computer companies. He
noticed that each claimed to be 'market driven', and talked about
'time-based competition' and 'core-based competences'.
He regards these notions as the 'holy grail of management' (instinctively
coining another phase) and argues that 'the holy grail is dysfunctional as
it distracts from getting on with the business'.
Robertson is not alone. At the Industrial Society, Andrew Forrest, director
of 'human resources', is staging a rearguard action, teaching companies that
if they want to say anything they should use words that everyone can grasp.
'It's like fighting through fog to understand what they are talking about,'
he says.
Some management talk is simply naff. 'Global' means no more than
international. 'Marketplace' is a cute way of saying market.
Then there are the euphemisms. Enlightened organisations do not have workers
any more. They have 'people'. Caring companies do not fire people, instead
they 'downsize' the organisation. Some go one step further and engage in
'rightsizing', fearing that the word 'down' might have negative
connotations.
Companies of the 1990s have 'partners', not suppliers. They do, of course,
still have customers whom they claim to worship. Unisys, the US computer
company, has developed a 'customerise philosophy' to get the message across.
Next are phrases to describe a company's professed beliefs. We have
corporate missions, corporate value statements, corporate visions. The nouns
are bad enough but the verbs are worse. We are meant to 'live' the mission,
'inbed' the vision. The work force has to 'buy into' all new initiatives (ie
to accept them) and thereafter 'take ownership'.
But the area in which jargon has made the most serious inroads is in
business strategy. Total quality management, business process
re-engineering, benchmarking, learning organisations, time-based
competition, the list goes on.
There is often a good excuse for these phrases. Most are a shorthand for a
more complicated notion. The danger is that different people mean different
things by the words, or they just use the words because it makes them feel
in the swing of things. 'Business process re-engineering doesn't come
tripping off the tongue. People have five different ideas of what the phase
means, and so it simply causes confusion,' says Forrest.
It is not hard to see why the words have proliferated. One reason is that
all management writers and consultants want to be famous; they come up with
an idea and then give it a brand name. Once created the words catch on.
According to Forrest, people use the words to make themselves appear more
knowledgeable then they are. 'It is easy to slip into jargon to make people
think you have something snappy to say,' he says.
Some industries are more prone to jargon than others. The electronics
companies are perhaps the worst. While others talk of the office as the
'workplace', computer companies have gone one step further and call it the
'enterprise environment'.
So what can be done? Management speak is so entrenched it is hard to see how
it could change. Yet Robertson thinks things will change if companies direct
their attention to the subject rather than the words. There is a special
piece of management jargon that says just that. Companies should 'walk the
talk'.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Management: Death by a thousand new-fangled buzzwords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three ideas, concepts or models - call them what you will depending on your
need for embellishment - are currently floating about in the management
world. One is empowerment, an ugly transatlantic neologism which suggests
that ordinary workers want, enjoy and benefit from being empowered. Of
course, with power comes responsibility, and it is not clear that workers
who warm to the former are equally happy about the latter. Also, the
empowerment of one group usually means the disempowerment of another group,
frequently the former's bosses.
The next idea is delayering, which is a simple, but enormously
consequential, structural issue.
For all sorts of reasons, including obvious ones such as a set span of
control, many organisations are very tall with many ranks, levels or layers.
Models such as the Catholic church are held up, which despite its size has
only three or four levels under its CEO, the Bishop of Rome. So the
preferred solution, and one which can be done with a stroke of the pen on
the organisational chart, is to take out one, two or more levels of
management.
The next idea, borrowed from the tough, masculine, no-nonsense world of
heavy industry is re-engineering. Though, as in all of these concepts, there
is some disagreement as to the precise meaning of the term, it implies that
organisations are structurally and functionally redesigned. Just as the old,
complicated, steam engine was re-engineered into the sleek bullet train, so
elaborate, traditional organisations can be streamlined.
What these three new ideas have in common is that they usually lead to a
similar result. Bluntly, these new-fangled ideas usually mean the sacking of
middle management.
Is this culling a good idea? Are most middle managers Peter-principled,
disengaged and therefore really pretty redundant? If so, why did that
situation arise in the first place? What is the role of someone between the
front-line supervisor and the directors?
In some organisations, middle managers will not be missed because senior or
top managers were performing their jobs. The owners directed, the directors
managed, the managers supervised, the supervisors worked. The job of
directors and top managers is predominantly planning, forward looking and
'visionary'. The job of the supervisor is primarily operational, day-to-day
management.
About 70 per cent of the time of the former is for thinking ahead and doing
work that cannot be delegated, while about the same amount of the time of
the latter is working with and through people at the coalface.
The middle manager - the departmental head, the divisional chief and the
co-ordinator - supposedly did some planning, some man-management and even
practised some of the skill for which they had been trained. Some were
simply bureaucrats, some against any change which threatened their
stability, and some simply incompetent.
Perhaps most organisations simply had too many middle managers and a bit of
judicious pruning was rather a good idea. But to remove a whole level, or
layer, or generation, may be exceptionally foolhardy, at least until its
function is fully understood.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Iraq trial statements 'inaccurate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Whitehall official wrote inaccurate draft witness statements before
the Matrix Churchill trial under advice from government lawyers, the Scott
inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Tony Steadman, former head of the Department of Trade and Industry's
export licensing unit, said that in July 1991 he had resisted advice from a
Customs investigator that he should downplay the extent of the government's
knowledge of Matrix Churchill's operations.
Mr Steadman said: 'I was unhappy about that because the intelligence we had
was greater than what was being said.'
Subsequently, however, Mr Steadman agreed to a request from a Treasury
solicitor that he delete a reference pointing to ministerial knowledge of
the military uses of export licences they were approving.
Questioned by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC,
he said that the statement with the deletions was inaccurate, but he had
agreed to them after assuming 'there must have been good reason for them'.
The final version of the witness statement had some of the deletions
reinserted after Mr Steadman had received different advice from a senior
lawyer acting for Customs.
The advice was that a witness statement which hinted at intelligence
knowledge of Matrix Churchill's operations would ensure that the trial judge
would agree that not disclosing Whitehall documents to the defence was
justified on security grounds.
He then admitted that even the final witness statement was inaccurate
because it omitted the fact that he had seen intelligence reports warning
that Matrix Churchill machine tools were being supplied to Iraq's missile
programme.
Mr Steadman said at the time of signing his witness statement he had not
thought of the intelligence reports.
The inquiry was adjourned until next Wednesday when Lord Justice Scott is
expected to question the Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, on issues
including the accountability of ministers, the use of intelligence and the
duties of civil servants.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has told the judge that ministers are
responsible for the acts of civil servants, although officials must share
some responsibility.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Not such a special relationship after
all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not, as some have claimed, the worst breach in UK/US relations since
Suez. Far from it. But nor is it the minor squall claimed by 10 Downing
Street.
The decision by President Bill Clinton to offer Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein
a public relations coup in New York was remarkable not so much in terms of
any new damage inflicted on UK/US relations. Seen through the focus of
Whitehall, its real significance lay in what it revealed about the state
that relationship had already reached. It is not an encouraging picture.
But first the hyperbole - with headlines declaring an end to 'the special
relationship' - should be cleared away.
The wide-ranging identity of interests which has long provided the
foundation for close ties between London and Washington has never guaranteed
a trouble-free friendship.
A flick through Baroness Thatcher's account of her days in Downing Street
provides ample evidence that even her famous partnership with President
Ronald Reagan had its ups and downs. The row over the US invasion of Grenada
is an obvious example. As one senior minister put it yesterday, even happily
married couples occasionally fall out.
Both sides were clearly anxious this week to isolate the latest disagreement
from the broader relationship. The White House put out what the New York
Times described as a lengthy and conciliatory statement emphasising 'the
importance that the US attaches to close co-operation with our British ally
on a range of global issues'.
For its part the Downing Street press office, now run by Mr Chris Meyer, the
former second in command at the UK's Washington embassy, was insistent that
the relationship was alive, well and vigorous.
In the narrow terms of the Irish problem there was also a suggestion that if
Mr Adams had done well this week, the trip might do some good in the longer
term. The Sinn Fein leader offered no concessions to his hosts in terms of
peace. President Clinton has dropped his campaign pledge to send a peace
envoy to Northern Ireland.
The White House cannot accept the Downing Street view which denies any other
government outside the British Isles a legitimate interest in the conflict.
But British officials are hopeful that as long as the London and Dublin
governments stick together in their approach to peace Mr Clinton will think
twice before granting Mr Adams another visa.
Scratch beneath the surface though and it does not take long to discover
real unease about the transatlantic relationship.
There is the concern that Mr Clinton is still surrounded by aides who want
to downgrade Britain's status. Resentments still burn against the Home
Office investigation into Mr Clinton's spell in Oxford in the 1960s and Tory
party help for the Republicans during the US election campaign.
Mr Major, received warmly during his visit to Washington a year ago, has
since been denied the ready access to the president that he could take for
granted from Mr George Bush. There is a distinct absence of personal
chemistry.
At last month's Nato summit France and Germany were the focus of US
attention - with President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl
the centre of attention.
Last year's transatlantic dispute over the west's approach to Bosnia did not
help - nor, in the view of some Whitehall officials, does the Euro-sceptic
rhetoric that Mr Major adopts to appease the right of the Conservative
party.
The weight Washington attaches to British views is in direct proportion to
the role London plays in the European Union. That link between influence in
Brussels and in Washington is likely to strengthen rather than weaken as the
US reduces its commitments in Europe.
In the old days of the cold war the US needed an ally whose reflex was
almost always to support Washington's stance. In a world where the communist
bloc no longer exists and Russia poses a much reduced threat, that
imperative is no longer quite so powerful.
The argument can be overstated. For all its relative decline, Britain still
holds an important place as a reliable ally. The State Department and the
Foreign Office have the sort of easy relationship that comes with the habit
of agreeing. The odds are that when Mr Major visits the White House at the
end of this month he will get a enthusiastic welcome.
But the world has changed. Ironically, former presidents Reagan and Bush and
the now Lady Thatcher were reunited in Washington last night for a gala
birthday party. You could almost hear them tut-tutting.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Armed forces limited to 2.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recommended pay increases of between 3 per cent and 4.4 per cent for the
armed forces are higher than for other public-sector employees, although
part of the increase is being held back until next January.
The recommendations were the only ones not accepted in full by the
government, which is limiting increases payable from April to 2.7 per cent.
The review body said it had taken into account the 'turbulence and
uncertainty' caused by defence cuts, and the fact that some military
salaries had fallen 'below broad comparability' with civilian earnings.
One officer said that the rise was 'realistically as much as we could have
expected'.
The changes will lift a brigadier's pay to Pounds 55,958 a year when fully
implemented and that of an army captain with three years in the rank to
Pounds 23,699.
Officials said that the initial 2.7 per cent rise was higher than foreseen
in the revised Pounds 23.5bn defence budget but this would not significantly
affect other Ministry of Defence plans. Last November defence spending
targets were cut by about Pounds 1.8bn over three years.
The ministry is due to set up an independent board in the next few weeks to
carry out a more far-reaching review of career structures, pay and
conditions in the armed forces.
Local authority employers yesterday predicted sweeping cuts in services
after teachers were awarded a flat 2.9 per cent pay increase by Mr John
Patten, the education secretary, John Authers writes.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said that
government rules would allow a maximum national increase in local government
expenditure of only 1.6 per cent next year.
Shortfalls will vary between authorities but Mr Graham Lane, who chairs the
AMA's education committee, said: 'Inevitably teachers will have to go and
class sizes rise.'
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the award was 'probably the best obtainable in the current
climate'.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said the rise would soon be
overtaken by inflation. 'The Teachers' Review Body is not independent and
nor is it considering the needs of education. It has bowed to the policies
of a government which dislikes public services.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / Review awards may cost 40,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 40,000 jobs will have to be shed from those parts of the public
sector covered by the pay review bodies if the government were to stick to
its planned pay bill freeze, wage analysts estimated last night.
When the government announced the public-sector freeze in September it said
pay rises were still possible but only as a result of job cuts and increased
productivity.
The pay rises averaging close to 3 per cent for more than 1.5m workers
announced yesterday are higher than the government would have liked, and
several City analysts doubted whether the required savings could come from
productivity increases and job losses alone.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, said: 'Settling for 2.7 to 3
per cent means one hell of a productivity gain and a lot of people being
sacked.'
Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, estimates that about
40,000 jobs will have to go to cover the pay rises for the 1.5m. But in the
whole of the public sector last year - when there was a 1.5 per cent pay
limit - the total job loss was only 120,000 and much of that was the result
of contracting-out of services.
The government has stressed that it will not dip into the contingency
reserve to fund the rises, but it has recently softened its position on the
funding of the pay rise by saying that savings from running costs can be
used as well as savings from the pay bills.
Mr Trinder said: 'A lot of recent policy - the 1.5 per cent norm, the pay
bill freeze and then its extension for another two years - has been made on
the hoof. With elections coming up and tax increases cutting people's real
pay, the government has decided to be pragmatic.'
Union leaders said inflation and tax rises would leave most people covered
by the review bodies with a wage cut of 1 per cent or 2 per cent in real
terms, but they were privately pleased that the government had not tampered
with most recommendations.
The pay review rises are roughly in line with current earnings in the
private sector, where some upward pressure is now expected.
The review body rises will set a ceiling of 3 per cent for the other 4m
public-sector workers, who are likely to get rises of between 1 per cent and
3 per cent. Public-sector pay increases overall are likely to lag behind
private-sector pay this year, but less than they did last year.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Lloyd's lifts its capacity to Pounds 10.9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday announced that its capacity - the amount of
premium its syndicates are allowed to accept - will increase towards the
upper end of expectations to Pounds 10.9bn in 1994, compared with Pounds
8.9bn in 1993.
Corporate investors have supplied Pounds 1.6bn in capacity, while individual
Names, who have traditionally provided the insurance market's capital base,
are committing Pounds 9.3bn.
'It is a very satisfactory situation for the market to be in and as good as
we could possibly have hoped,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman.
An increase in average commitments by individual Names reflected in part the
relaxation of solvency requirements and helped offset a decline in the
number of Names to 18,022 from 19,537.
So-called 'working Names' - who work with agencies and brokers at Lloyd's -
raised their average involvement to Pounds 372,000 from Pounds 318,000,
while external Names raised their overall premium limits to Pounds 561,000
from Pounds 486,000 in 1993.
Mr Rowland also said Lloyd's was considering changes to new voting rules,
after protests by Names action groups. The market took the first steps last
year to weight its voting system in favour of Names committing increased
capital.
Separately, Mr Richard Southwell QC criticised internal disciplinary
procedures at Lloyd's. Mr Southwell was deputy president of a Lloyd's appeal
tribunal sitting in the case of Mr Edward Cowen, a former underwriter.
Mr Cowen was suspended from the market after a Lloyd's investigation into a
series of reinsurance transactions entered into between 1987 and 1989. A
Lloyd's disciplinary committee later upheld the suspension and publicly
censured Mr Cowen, after finding him guilty of four charges of
'discreditable' conduct and one of 'detrimental' conduct.
On appeal Mr Southwell confirmed the penalty of notice of censure but found
Mr Cowen guilty of 'discreditable' conduct on only one charge. The case
against Mr Cowen had lasted a total of 72 days between 1990 and 1992.
In his decision, made available yesterday, Mr Southwell said: 'In future,
proceedings of this kind should be conducted so as to ensure, so far as
possible, a shorter period before trial, a shorter trial, less expenditure
of money and less burden, above all on the defendant faced with disciplinary
charges, but also on Lloyd's'
In conducting a trial 'wherever appropriate and fair, the procedure should
not be allowed to become excessively legalistic', said Mr Southwell.

FT  04 FEB 94 / 720 jobs go in freight failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elan International, the express freight and parcels delivery company, has
collapsed, putting 720 people out of work and leaving debts of Pounds 5.9m.
The company, one of the leading 20 in a competitive market, called in Mr
David Wilton, a partner in Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, as liquidator on Wednesday afternoon after it had run out of funds
with which to carry on trading.
Mr Wilton began laying off staff on Wednesday evening, as workers came on
shift to be told of the company's failure.
Elan had an annual turnover of Pounds 28m but had been making losses for
what Mr Wilton called 'a period of time', although he was not able yesterday
to quantify them.
Mr Wilton attributed the losses to 'the lower levels of freight being
carried because of the recession', and the fact that 'this market is very
cut-throat'.
The collapse of the company comes as the parcels delivery market, often seen
as an economic barometer, is stabilising after recession.
The express delivery sector accounts for about 10 per cent of the market,
which is valued at more than Pounds 1.2bn a year.
Mr Wilton, who has received inquiries about the purchase of Elan, is trying
to establish exactly what the company owns. It has been operating from its
Birmingham headquarters and 18 depots across the UK, using about 300
vehicles.
A meeting of creditors has been provisionally set for February 15.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Labour says tax debate gagged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday accused the government of 'gagging' debate on new
taxation measures, as the row over the parliamentary guillotine on the
finance bill continued.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said: 'The way the government has
tabled this debate shows that they want to stifle debate on key tax issues.'
Labour attacked the government for placing important issues at the end of
each day's procedures. This means they are unlikely to be discussed before
the guillotine falls.
The row arose after the government's decision to put a strict limit on the
time available for discussion of the finance bill. This is the first time
since 1974 - other than before an election - that a guillotine has been used
on the bill which implements the Budget.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, said the government had allowed
'generous' time for debate of the bill.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's senior civil servants will only have pay rises related to their
performance from this April, under the review body report on senior salaries
accepted yesterday by the government.
Only permanent secretaries will receive an overall pay rise of 2.5 per cent.
The budget allocated to senior civil servants for performance pay is to rise
by 2.75 percentage points to 4.75 per cent. The review body also argued that
judges should have the 16-plus per cent increase it recommended two years
ago phased in on top of a regular uprating of their salaries to April 1
1999. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has accepted this.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division
Civil Servants, welcomed the decision to accept the recommendations but
added that the pay of senior civil servants would still be below that of
comparable private-sector positions.
The report argued for a larger budget for performance pay for senior civil
servants to ensure more 'refined' awards within a wider pay range.
A new bonus scheme is also proposed to offer up to 30 high-flyers rises of
at least one-twentieth of current annual salary.
The report said it was not 'healthy' for senior civil servants' morale and
motivation that they should feel they are underpaid. It also recognised that
job security had declined in recent years.
The review body said it had 'serious doubts' about continuing the rigid pay
linkage between the judiciary and career civil servants and military
officers. It pointed out that QCs promoted to become High Court judges took
a 50 per cent cut in salary.

FT  04 FEB 94 / End of centralised NHS pay signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the present system of central pay determination in the National
Health Service was signalled yesterday.
Pay increases of 3 per cent for nearly 500,000 doctors, dentists, nurses,
midwives and other health professionals will come into effect from April 1.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, announcing acceptance of the
recommendations from the NHS review bodies, said the government intended to
ensure that pay arrangements in the service provided for a 'significant
measure of local pay determination from next year'.
Shifting pay to local level is one of the biggest items of unfinished
business from the 1991 NHS reforms. NHS trusts - which from April will run
almost all hospital, community and ambulance services - have powers to seek
to vary national pay agreements, but few do so.
The government's determination to move to local performance pay received
ample encouragement in yesterday's review body reports.
The doctors' and dentists' report said a 'significant shift from central to
local pay determination' over the coming years was inevitable in the NHS
internal market. It had 'little doubt that the focal point for productivity
bargaining should be the trusts'.
The review body believes that even the pay of general practitioners - who
are self-employed contractors - could be related more to local
circumstances.
The report shows that the government argued in its evidence for
'exceptionally modest' national increases this April, leaving maximum scope
for local bargaining. But the review body did not believe enough progress
would be made to introduce local productivity arrangements by April.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, welcomed the review bodies'
'enthusiasm' for local determination of performance pay, and said she
attached 'the highest priority' to the introduction of arrangements from
next year.
The proposal will meet strong opposition from NHS professional organisations
and unions, on both industrial relations and medical grounds. Dr Sandy
Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said nationally
determined pay had ensured equitable standards across the UK.
The Royal College of Nursing - which condemned this year's 3 per cent
increase as inadequate - was also cautious over the call by its pay review
body for a national enabling agreement to facilitate the introduction of
local pay.
The nurses' review body said it expected to see by next year 'a framework
established for effective local pay determination, with clear prospects for
achieving pay increases based on local achievements and needs'.

A working group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales has drafted proposals calling for the government to reform the law on
the liability of auditors.
Members of the group are calling for the removal of a legal provision which
prohibits auditors from limiting the amount for which they can be sued.
They are also recommending changes to the principle of joint and several
liability, which allows any successful plaintiff to pursue any one of
several defendants found to have acted wrongfully for the entire amount of a
judgment.
This can often mean accountants rather than directors or others being named
in a writ, since they are perceived to have the deepest pockets.
The proposals have to be ratified by the next institute council meeting in
March.
The arguments, which will be presented to the Department of Trade and
Industry, echo calls for reform made in lobbying efforts by the largest
eight accountancy firms.
The institute goes further than the firms, which decided not to call for
reform of joint and several liability, believing that a change was unlikely
to find favour with the public.
The group, chaired by Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse, may
yet run into difficulties with smaller accountancy firms and accountants in
business, who believe the case for reform serves the interests of the
largest firms.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Traders and councils begin market haggling: Mounting
opposition to charter de-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition is growing to the government's intention, spelt out in its
de-regulation bill, to abolish market charters.
The measure, which would rescind franchise rights going back in some cases
to the 12th century, would break the power of local authorities to stop
markets being set up within 6.66 miles of one of their own markets.
Opposition to charter abolition in Birmingham, where the issues crystallise,
is coming from existing market traders, from the city council and from some
local MPs.
Last week Ms Clare Short and Mr Robin Corbett, Birmingham Labour MPs, took
delivery of a petition signed by 9,000 people who fear that de-regulation
would affect trade at the city's Bull Ring markets.
The petition is one of a series that are being gathered nationally by the
National Association of British Market Authorities.
The Department of the Environment said 182 English and 24 Welsh district
councils, 32 metropolitan authorities and 16 London boroughs had market
charters.
With privileges so widespread, plans to withdraw them were bound to trigger
strong opposition. The department, in a written parliamentary answer to Ms
Short, said it had received 2,322 replies against and 273 in favour in
response to its request for comments on the plan to scrap market charters.
The issue has become confused with political concern about the use of
car-boot sales as a conduit for stolen goods. Abolition of charters has been
equated with the loss of powers to control car-boot sales.
But the purpose of charters has been to protect fixed and regular markets.
Car-boot sales are movable and occasional. As charters are not held by all
councils, they are an imperfect tool for dealing with a national concern.
Mrs Catherine Finnegan, who chairs Birmingham council's commercial services
committee, said: 'The government's proposals would mean the proliferation of
unregulated markets with no control over the quality of goods sold.' The
council is also angry with what it calls 'tinkering around with its common
law rights' and the prospect of losing revenue - Pounds 360,000 a year -
from franchising markets in its exclusion zone.
For the government, market charters are simply a monopoly power. The
environment department said that they were 'rights which can be used to
impose restraints on the development of local enterprise' and 'anachronistic
common-law rights opposed to competition'.
The department denies that local authorities should be compensated for lost
revenue because councils are public bodies and the use of the charters is
against public interest.
The immediate commercial beneficiaries of de-regulation would be companies
which provide facilities for small retailers to trade without facing high
fixed charges.
One such company is In Shops, which operates retail centres throughout the
UK in competition with fixed markets and is often at odds with councils.
Mr Tim Brookes, the In Shops chairman, said: 'Many local authorities are
saying de-regulation spells the end of markets.
'My response to that is that if a market sells shoddy goods at expensive
prices, then it deserves to fail.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / Promise on prison slopping out broken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has gone back on a promise made three
years ago by Mr Kenneth Baker, one of his predecessors, to end slopping out
in prisons by the end of this year, David Owen writes.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Howard blamed the delay on the forecast
increase in the prison population. This has reduced the amount of prison
accommodation planned to be taken out of use for refurbishment during the
next two years, he said.
'The alternative would have been a return to the prolonged use of police
cells and an unacceptable level of overcrowding,' he added.
Mr Baker made the original promise in February 1991 when responding to Lord
Justice Woolf's report into serious riots at six prisons. In April 1990, the
then home secretary said the programme to give all prisoners access to
sanitation would cost Pounds 36m.
Mr Howard said the government's aim now was to complete the programme 'no
later than February 1996, the date recommended by Lord Woolf'.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Film institute's budgeting rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Film Institute overspent by Pounds 108,000 at its London Film
Festival last year because of poor budgetary control, says a report released
by the National Audit Office today.
It warns that audiences are perilously low at the National Film Theatre and
the Museum of the Moving Image, both in London.
The report says that the institute's senior management agreed to unrealistic
budgets for the festival and officials were not monitored sufficiently.
Mr Wilf Stevenson, BFI director, said: 'I think the report is a little
unkind to us. We have to decide what films we are going to screen in advance
of knowing whether we are going to get audiences or not.
'The festival is by definition risky and experimental and it is in its
nature that you are bound to have uncertain spending patterns.'
He added: 'The expenditure overruns will not happen again because we have
put in better controls.'
The report pinpoints the National Film Theatre and Museum of the Moving
Image as vulnerable parts of the institute's operation. It warns that the
institute will have to take 'difficult decisions' if attendance levels at
the theatre and museum do not improve. Last year the National Film Theatre
filled 31,000 fewer seats than budgeted.
The report cites the recession, the theatre's South Bank location and
increasing competition from television as the reasons for the decline in
ticket sales.
Mr Stevenson said: 'We want to take account of the changes in viewer
behaviour and are making changes in our programming now. We will try to
offer what TV can't - what we call 'live cinema' - bringing in film-makers
to introduce their movies.'
Visitor figures for the Museum of the Moving Image have fallen from 536,000
in 1989-90 to 368,000 in 1992-93. Audience levels are now at about half the
level needed to break even. The audit office urged the institute to monitor
its marketing strategy closely.
Mr Stevenson said: 'A recent visitor survey said the Museum of the Moving
Image was the most popular attraction in London so we obviously have a good
product.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / DTI seeks to simplify arbitration law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has published a draft bill to simplify
and streamline English arbitration law. The move is an attempt to stem the
loss of lucrative international arbitration from London to the US and the
Netherlands.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said when announcing the
proposals that the move was part of the government's de-regulation
initiative.
He said the present arbitration law was difficult to follow because it was
spread across three acts of parliament and various pieces of case law. The
bill would pull the strands together and make English arbitration more
acceptable internationally, he said.
The bill is intended as a statement of the more important principles of
English law and is designed to be largely uncontroversial by introducing
reforms for which there is widespread support.
The draft was drawn up in the private sector before being taken over by the
Departmental Advisory Committee on Arbitration chaired by Lord Justice
Steyn. The document follows the structure of the Model Law on Commercial
Arbitration which was formulated by the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (Uncitral). This has been adopted by 16 countries.
It is hoped the bill will make English arbitration procedures both faster
and cheaper by simplifying English law and doing away with the need to adopt
many of the adversarial and oral procedures peculiar to common law
jurisdictions but unknown in half the industrialised world.
The bill contains a clause giving arbitrators freedom to determine their own
procedures and to decide whether to follow the English courts' technical
rules of evidence.
The DTI is allowing five months' consultation on the draft to obtain views
on a number of issues which remain controversial. The government
specifically wants to know whether the legislation should provide that an
arbitration clause is separable from the underlying contract and therefore
survives an invalid contract. It is also seeking views on the immunity of
arbitrators.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Romance added to firm's accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small north London accountancy firm has decided to capitalise on the
consequences of the profession's unfortunate image as boring.
In what must be the most unusual diversification yet from the core work of
audit and tax advice, George &amp; Co, based in Enfield, has launched a dating
agency for accountants.
Just in time for Valentine's Day, it placed an advertisement this week
announcing its services in Pass, a magazine for trainee accountants.
'Prolink' is now taking calls from romance-seeking accountants and other
professionals seeking similar types for meals, films and discussions on
double-entry bookkeeping.
Mr Paul George, who dreamed up the idea, said there was a market for
accountants wanting to meet each other because of their reputation of being
boring, and to allow them to talk to each other about their work.
Dateline, the computer dating agency, said more than 10 per cent of all new
male applicants were accountants.
'Accountancy is one of the most difficult professions for people trying to
find dates,' said Ms Frances Pyne of Dateline.
She said this was because it was male-dominated and many accountants worked
alone or in small offices.
Young accountants were sceptical yesterday. 'I think we meet enough
accountants here already,' said Ms Natalie Marchant, who works for Price
Waterhouse.
'In principle there's nothing wrong with it,' she added hastily.
Mr Giles Davies, a colleague, said: 'It's a bit sad. I would only use it as
a joke. The assumptions behind it come right out of Monty Python.'
He added: 'Accountants do date a lot, but largely when they are training and
no-one else understands the pressures. It's a shame if you don't broaden
your horizons afterwards.'
But Prolink has already received nearly 50 inquiries from romance-seeking
accountants.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Pensions row faces second Commons probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to come under further pressure in the growing row over
personal pensions advice after a decision by a second body of MPs to
investigate the subject.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, looks set to be dragged
directly into the firing line, with the social security committee expecting
to call him to answer questions before Easter.
The social security committee inquiry will begin as the government's
approach to financial regulation - particularly in the context of advice
offered to people to take out personal pensions - comes under scrutiny from
the Treasury and civil service committee of MPs.
The Treasury committee is to begin its investigation later this month by
taking evidence from two of the most vocal critics of the plan for
self-regulation through the Personal Investment Authority.
Its first witness is to be Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential,
the UK's largest life insurer, who has called for statutory regulation. The
views of the Consumers' Association will also be sought early on, as will
evidence from Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life,
who resigned from the PIA last month in protest that the planned composition
of its board membership did not amount to self-regulation.
Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for financial
regulation, is likely to come before the committee early in the summer.
In the case of both inquiries, MPs' interest has been intensified by a
series of revelations that have raised strong concerns about the quality of
advice on pension-related issues.
The Treasury committee announced its inquiry after the publication of a
study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog. The study suggested that in nine out of 10
cases where someone transferring out of an occupational pension scheme was
sold a personal pension, the sale did not comply with regulators'
requirements.
The focus of the new inquiry - soon to be announced officially - will be on
advice given to people who transferred out of the state earnings related
pension scheme (Serps).
MPs on the social security committee argue that figures showing that a
considerable number of these people are now unemployed or on low incomes
give grounds for believing the advice they were offered was inadequate.
Statistics released by the Department of Social Security in December showed
a significant number of personal pension sales to people contracting out of
Serps involved people who could not benefit from tax incentives and so might
well be worse off as a result of contracting out.

FT  04 FEB 94 / 'Lone' Thatcher led arms talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final stage of a Pounds 1bn arms deal between the UK and Malaysia,
alleged to have been won by Britain in return for the promise of aid, was
negotiated privately by Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, and the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher excluded officials from the final meeting on the deal in Kuala
Lumpur in September 1988 when a memorandum of understanding between the two
countries was signed, according to a businessman closely involved in trade
relations between the two countries.
'The officials were asked to leave because it was felt that they were
slowing down negotiations,' the businessman said. 'It was a race against
time for us (the UK).'
The question of whether Lady Thatcher had a role in promising aid to
Malaysia in return for the defence sales may be examined by the Commons
foreign affairs committee, which is investigating why the UK promised Pounds
234m of aid for Malaysia's Pergau Dam against the advice of Sir Timothy
Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration.
Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP who will chair the sessions examining Pergau,
said it was possible the committee would want to question Lady Thatcher
directly.
The committee is also likely to examine allegations which appear in today's
Economist magazine that the protocol on the defence package, signed in March
1988 by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, contained a clause that aid
would be given equal to a percentage of the value of the defence sales. Any
such clause would have breached UK government guidelines.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, disclosed last month that the
protocol included a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects
under this programme' - but he did not mention any formula determining the
value of such aid.
Lord Younger said last night that he did not remember the protocol
containing such an explicit formula. However, in June 1988 he wrote to
Malaysia saying that aid could not be linked to defence sales.
The Economist says that soon after Lord Younger's letter was sent, the
Foreign Office wrote to Malaysia reiterating that aid would nevertheless be
provided, though no mention was made of the defence sales.
The Foreign Office yesterday said that the donation of aid to Malaysia in
the late 1980s was 'strictly within the law'.
Lady Thatcher was unavailable for comment.

FT  04 FEB 94 / GP drugs bill faces curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering extending a scheme that gives family doctors
an incentive to prescribe economically as part of a drive to curb spiralling
drug costs.
Ministers are keen to expand the scope of present arrangements that permit
GPs whose prescribing costs fall below a target level to keep a proportion
of their savings. Some such arrangements have been running on a pilot basis
since last April.
The need for action was underlined by last month's announcement that
allocations for GP prescribing for 1994-95 have been increased by 12.3 per
cent.
This means GPs in England are expected to spend a total of Pounds 3.2bn on
drugs.
Ministers are anxious to slow this rate of increase to prevent drugs from
taking an ever-increasing share of the National Health Service's overall
budget. Family doctors prescribe about 80 per cent of drugs by value.
Later this month the government is expected to announce an increase in the
standard prescription charge of well above the rate of inflation.
If the higher allocation for GP prescribing is an indication of the likely
rise in prescription charges - as has been hinted - an increase from Pounds
4.25 to about Pounds 4.75 would be implied.
In the Commons yesterday Mr John Smith, Labour leader, challenged Mr John
Major at prime minister's question time over the likelihood of prescription
increases. 'Any increase would come on top of massive tax increases already
being imposed by this government,' he said.
Mr Major said the government would make an announcement on any rise when it
was in a position to do so.
The government expects the expansion of GP fundholding to act as a further
brake on escalating drug costs.
It says spending on prescribing by fundholders has been rising at about 3
per cent less than that by non-fundholders.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Backbenchers may wreck shopping bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is seriously concerned that the shops bill, which liberalises
Sunday trading laws in England and Wales, may be sabotaged next week by an
alliance of Labour and Conservative MPs.
Supporters of Sunday shopping celebrated in December when MPs voted by a
majority of 75 in a free vote to allow all-day trading for small shops, and
up to six hours' opening for large stores.
The successful formula was put forward by an alliance of big stores as a
compromise between alternative proposals for full de-regulation or tight
controls.
The decision paved the way for ministers to fulfil a manifesto promise to
replace the widely ignored 1950 Shops Act.
However, the Home Office is worried that the Keep Sunday Special (KSS)
campaign, which sought tight Sunday-shopping regulation, may have found a
way to wreck the bill.
Ministers fear that die-hard Tory supporters of KSS will support a Labour
amendment guaranteeing double time to shop workers when the bill's
line-by-line committee stage debate resumes on Wednesday.
A Home Office official said: 'It is very close. We are not sure how many
backbench Conservatives will be willing to defy the government, but it could
be the best chance the KSS people have to wreck the bill.'
The government would reject such an amendment because it believes that other
groups of workers would seek similar statutory protection.
There is also concern about an alternative proposal from KSS restricting
Sunday opening to small shops, which would also have the effect of wrecking
the bill.
The government is not allowing a free vote on the amendments, in an attempt
to limit any Conservative rebellion.
But large-scale abstentions by Conservative MPs would be almost equally
dangerous because the amendments would have solid support from opposition
MPs, including those who voted for the six-hours option.
Even a narrow government majority could lead to serious problems when the
bill goes to the House of Lords later this year because peers are often more
willing to obstruct the government when its Commons majority is in doubt.
The Lords may also point to the absence of a specific government manifesto
commitment to the six-hours option to justify substantial amendments to the
bill.
The government will argue that any attempt to wreck the bill will reinstate
the existing unworkable law and could lead to widespread job losses.
But ministers have no prepared fall-back position in the event of defeat on
the double-time amendment.
Ironically, the big stores are less concerned than ministers because most
already pay between one and a half and two times normal wages to Sunday
staff.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday ruled that Toys R Us was wrongly convicted and
fined Pounds 22,200 for putting price tags on items which did not tally with
till prices.
Two judges said in a test case that the toys retailer should be acquitted of
34 offences of misleading the public because it was company practice for
staff to check that ticket prices on items for sale matched those appearing
on bar codes read at the tills. When discrepancies occurred, till operators
were required to charge the customer the lower price.
Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Scott Baker, said this meant
goods were in reality 'available' at the lower price and therefore no
offence had been committed under the 1987 Consumer Protection Act.
The judges directed magistrates at Whitminster, Gloucestershire, who found
Toys R Us guilty of the 34 offences in December 1992, to acquit the company
on charges brought by the county council's trading standards department. The
department indicated that the case might go to the House of Lords for a
final ruling.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Lloyd's declares 'satisfactory' rise in capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday announced that its capacity - the amount of
premium its syndicates are allowed to accept - will increase towards the
upper end of expectations to Pounds 10.9bn this year compared with Pounds
8.9bn in 1993.
Corporate investors have supplied Pounds 1.6bn in capacity, while individual
Names, who have traditionally provided the insurance market's capital base,
are committing Pounds 9.3bn.
'It is a very satisfactory situation for the market to be in and as good as
we could possibly have hoped,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman.
An increase in average commitments by individual Names partially reflected
the relaxation of solvency requirements and helped offset a decline in the
number of Names to 18,022 from 19,537.
Ninety-five corporate members - most of which are subsidiaries of more than
a dozen Lloyd's investment trusts - have joined the market.
So-called 'working Names' - who work with agencies and brokers at Lloyd's -
raised their average involvement to Pounds 372,000 from Pounds 318,000,
while external Names raised their overall premium limits to Pounds 561,000
from Pounds 486,000 last year.
The total number of Lloyd's syndicates fell to 179 from 228 at the start of
last year, underlining recent rationalisation in the market. More than 400
syndicates underwrote in 1990.
Lloyd's, which is expecting to make profits when it reports its results for
1993 in 1996 - in line with its three-year accounting system - said that the
recent Los Angeles earthquake was unlikely to affect its 1994 results. Mr
Rowland said that the London market would not be affected unless total
insured losses exceeded Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.33bn). Insured losses are
currently expected to be less than this.
The chairman also announced that Lloyd's was considering changes to new
voting rules, after protests by Names action groups.
Lloyd's took the first steps to weight its voting system in favour of Names
committing greater amounts of capital to the market last year.
But many existing individual Names argued that they could be forced to pay
levies as a result of votes cast by corporate capital, which itself has
protection from such levies. Lloyd's council - or governing body - will
consider the issue next month.
Lloyd's issued details of disciplinary procedings against Mr Edward Cowen,
former underwriter of syndicate 529. Mr Cowen was suspended from the market
and publically censured after being found guilty of charges of
'disreputable' and 'detrimental' conduct.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Charges on war crimes ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish legal authorities have decided not to prosecute 17 alleged war
criminals living in Scotland.
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which traces former Nazi war criminals, said
the decision meant killers would never be brought to trial. It was a
'terrible blow' to efforts to bring Holocaust murderers to justice.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions in Scotland, said no
prosecutions were to be brought because of a lack of evidence.
An investigation unit set up in May 1991 will be disbanded, although the
inquiry could be reopened if fresh evidence emerges.
A parallel investigation into alleged war criminals living in England is
still under way.
The all-party parliamentary war crimes group, which is chaired by Lord
Merlyn-Rees, former Labour home secretary, said it had expected a 'more
encouraging decision' after the 1987 libel case in which Mr Antanas Gecas,
78, who lives in Edinburgh, unsuccessfully sued Scottish Television over its
claim that he had committed war crimes in Lithuania.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Parents could be fined up to Pounds 1,000 if their children do not comply
with court orders, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, proposed
yesterday.
Courts could force parents to ensure children under 18 turned up at
attendance centres or kept appointments with social workers or probation
officers.
'Parents cannot wash their hands of their children once they have committed
a crime,' the home secretary said. 'Teaching children the difference between
right and wrong is a process which must begin in the home and continue
throughout childhood.'
Courts can now impose a Pounds 1,000 fine on parents who refuse to be bound
over to ensure their children do not commit further crimes. Mr Howard
proposes that parents could be bound over to make sure the child not only
does not offend again, but completes the sentence already imposed.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Inland Revenue to relax annuity rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue has agreed to relax rules for members of some small
pension schemes, in response to concerns that existing requirements force
pensioners to purchase annuities at the bottom of the market.
Government tax authorities are also said to be considering further
clarifications of rules in order to allow people to buy so-called variable
or staggered annuities. These spread annuity purchases over a longer period
of time so that pensioners need not invest all their assets in a single
low-yielding annuity contract.
The new rules, which affect only Small Self-Administered Schemes, will allow
scheme members to defer purchasing an annuity until a maximum age of 75.
There are about 40,000 SSASs in the UK, most with two or three members each.
Current rules require them to purchase annuities within five years of
retirement.
Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions manager at Scottish Equitable, said: 'This
creates difficulties, particularly for those who retire quite early.'
In making the rule change, the Revenue said it had been prompted by the
Association of Pension Trustees which raised the issue 18 months ago.
Since then the price for retirement annuities has risen dramatically as
interest rates have fallen, meaning that scheme members have had to pay far
more now to buy benefits than they would have three years ago. With low
inflation and low interest rates forecast for some years to come, annuity
market conditions are unlikely to improve soon.
Fixed-rate annuity prices are directly linked to the yields on 15-year UK
government gilts, while index-linked annuities reflect a combination of
15-year gilts prices and the prices of UK government index-linked bonds.
Mr John Bradley, chairman of the APT, said that between October 1992 and
October 1993 yields on index-linked annuities fell 12 per cent while yields
on fixed-rate annuities fell by 25 per cent.
Mr Ritchie said that today a 65-year old male needs to spend Pounds 8.80 to
buy Pounds 1 per year of annuity income. Two to three years ago, he could
have bought the same benefit for Pounds 6.70.

FT  04 FEB 94 / MPs warn nuclear industry of huge costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The huge cost of scrapping Britain's nuclear plants may push up taxes and
electricity bills, a parliamentary committee warned yesterday.
The Public Accounts Committee, the Commons watchdog on public spending,
criticised what it called the nuclear industry's repeated failure to foresee
the likely costs of decommissioning.
The committee said: 'Weaknesses in oversight have led to inadequate
provisions in the industry's accounts.'
The PAC has endorsed some of the concerns of a report by the National Audit
Office in July, which warned that nuclear generators might not be able to
pay for decommissioning their plants.
The task of safely dismantling nuclear plants is one of the industry's
biggest financial burdens. Uncertainty about the liabilities disrupted the
electricity privatisation four years ago and the government retained
ownership of nuclear facilities.
The National Audit Office put the cost of scrapping all nuclear power
stations and fuel plants, as well as some military facilities, at Pounds
18bn at 1992 prices, although much of the money will not be spent for many
years.
The committee called yesterday for the establishment of a 'visible
guaranteed fund' to provide for the eventual decommissioning of the plants.
Mr Doug McRoberts of Nuclear Electric, the generator, said last night: 'We
will not be a drain on the taxpayer. Nuclear Electric needs to lay aside
Pounds 2.7bn by the time our existing stations reach the end of their lives,
and we have no doubt we can do that.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / British Coal prepares to shut three more pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday signalled the closure of three more pits as it neared
the end of a programme to rationalise the industry for privatisation.
Closure of the Ellington pit, the last deep mine in the north-east of
England, is likely to be confirmed today.
Review meetings, usually the precursor of closure, are also being arranged
soon for the Annesley and Ollerton mines in Nottinghamshire.
Yesterday's announcement will leave British Coal with two fewer working pits
than envisaged in October 1992 when the corporation announced closure of
three-fifths of the industry but was forced to backtrack because of public
outcry.
Although one or two further pits may be closed before privatisation as their
seams near exhaustion, most which have not been earmarked for closure are
likely to be offered to the private sector in the five sale packages being
prepared by the government.
Yesterday's three pits bring to six the total identified for closure this
week, although that includes Silverwood in the Yorkshire region, which is
not being developed and is being merged with nearby Maltby. This will leave
British Coal with 17 working pits, including the Silverwood/Maltby merged
unit.
Asfordby in Leicestershire has yet to open and is likely to be offered as
part of one of the packages.
All six pits identified for closure this week were, until recently,
considered to have safe futures.
The others identified or named for closure at the start of this week were
Goldthorpe, in the Yorkshire area, and Manton in Nottinghamshire.
The other survivors are: Kellingley, Kiveton, North Selby, Prince of Wales,
Riccall, Stillingfleet, Whitemoor and Wistow, all in the Yorkshire area;
Bilsthorpe, Daw Mill, Harworth, Thoresby and Welbeck, all in the Midlands;
Longannet in Scotland; and Tower and Point of Ayr in Wales.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Pounds 650m rise in electricity prices 'unjustified'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity distribution industry was yesterday accused by two consumer
groups of imposing Pounds 650m of 'unjustified' price rises in the three
years following privatisation.
The National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association urged Offer,
the electricity industry regulator, to claw back 'excess returns' and cut
prices. The two groups said domestic price rises of 13 per cent in the first
three years after privatisation had failed to deliver better service.
Their report is the latest in a series criticising power distributors over
price rises and profits, and accusing them of favouring shareholders over
customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the report showed the
need for the government to put pressure on companies to give back money to
consumers. 'Consumers were promised lower bills with privatisation,' he
said. 'Instead the main beneficiary has been the City.'
The issue is increasingly sensitive as the government prepares to impose
value added tax of 8 per cent on electricity bills in April.
Protests about recent high profit rises suggest that controls which the
industry might regard as draconian would be seen as inadequate by consumers
and political opponents of privatisation.
One of Offer's problems is that the review covers only power distribution
businesses, which account for about 25 per cent of final power bills. Tight
controls would have limited impact on final prices.
Offer and the power distributors frequently say prices have fallen in real
terms since privatisation, particularly since last April, which is not
covered by yesterday's report.
They also point to improved service standards. But yesterday's report, a
response to an Offer consultation document, demonstrates the cynicism with
which the industry's claims are regarded.
Analysts say a case can be made for real rises and falls, with the outcome
depending on the start and end dates and on assumptions for inflation.
The Consumers' Association said electricity companies could have made a more
than adequate profit without increased prices. Dr John Belshon, its chief
executive, said: 'Offer has got to get its act together urgently. It has
been sitting on its hands for too long.'
The National Consumer Council said the regional companies' rate of return
for the distribution businesses reached 9.2 per cent in 1992-93, compared
with 6 per cent at British Gas and targets in the water industry of between
5 per cent and 6 per cent.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Gummer to press ahead with review of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The local government review in England will continue in spite of objections
from the High Court and backbench Conservative MPs, Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, said yesterday.
He will not appeal against last week's High Court ruling that the government
exceeded its powers in its guidance to the Local Government Commission that
the two-tier status quo should continue only in 'exceptional' circumstances.
But he reaffirmed his determination to establish all-purpose unitary
authorities in most of rural England. He said: 'The aim continues to be to
provide effective and convenient local government which takes account of
community identities. The government believes that unitary authorities will
often be the best way of achieving these objectives.'
Mr Gummer gave some comfort to backbench Conservatives who have threatened
to vote against proposals to abolish county councils. He added: 'There is no
national blueprint and the government does not rule out consideration of two
tiers in particular circumstances.'
Local authority reaction was divided. The Labour-controlled Association of
County Councils said the review, due by the end of this year, should be
postponed by at least three months while the commission adapted to its
changed guidance.
The cross-party Association of District Councils said the announcement kept
the review 'firmly on course for completion by the end of this year'.
Local authorities in England should be able to provide services in the
coming financial year at a cost their council-tax payers could afford, Mr
Gummer told the Commons last night. He confirmed that the councils would
receive Pounds 34.3bn in support from the national exchequer, an increase of
1.7 per cent over 1993-94.

The Ulster Unionist party plans to publish within three weeks proposals for

The plan emerged yesterday as Mr John Major, the prime minister, underlined
the government's determination to press ahead with talks in an effort to
wrest back the initiative from Sinn Fein after Mr Gerry Adams' highly
publicised visit to the US this week.
Mr Major told MPs at question time that progress in the province 'cannot and
will not wait for Sinn Fein'. The government would 'actively carry forward
the political talks with the constitutional parties and with the Irish
government'.
The delicacy of the task was highlighted when Dublin reacted frostily to a
suggestion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a
Financial Times interview that London would bring forward its proposals for
a political settlement in the next two weeks.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said in a terse statement that it
was 'important' the British paper be 'directed to the achievement of the
objective which the two governments have jointly set themselves, namely a
comprehensive political settlement which addresses all the main
relationships'.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party, said he would not accept any variation from the so-called
'three-stranded' format, covering relationships in the province, between
north and south, and between London and Dublin.
According to Sir Patrick, London's fresh ideas will cover devolved
government in Northern Ireland and formal mechanisms for enhancing
cross-border co-operation. 'Strand Three,' he said, 'is for the two
governments'.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, who
are boycotting the talks, said yesterday that the party would not
participate in talks 'either under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish agreement or
the Downing Street Declaration'.
The UUP paper, which the party is aiming to publish before Sinn Fein holds
its party conference on February 26 and 27, is expected to argue that a
blueprint for devolved government in the province - agreed between the
constitutional parties - is needed before progress can be made on
cross-border co-operation.
Drawn up after consultation with grassroots unionists, it is expected to
flesh out the 'blueprint for stability' proposed by Mr James Molyneaux, the
UUP leader, in March. It is likely to suggest that an Ulster assembly should
start life with few if any legislative powers.
Meanwhile, Mr Adams was heckled and jostled yesterday by victims of IRA
violence when he arrived in Dublin.

FT  04 FEB 94 / French shipyard confirms Swan bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French shipbuilder, last night
confirmed it intends to make an offer to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipyard which has been in receivership since May, Chris Tighe writes.
The French company recently beat Swan Hunter in the fight for a Pounds 50m
Oman patrol boats order. Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of English subsidiary
CMN Support Services, said: 'We intend to make an offer subject to the
preconditions being sorted out.' He added: 'We would hope to largely
continue the present workforce.' He could not give any indication of the
value of the bid.
Mr Henderson said good progress had been made in two days of talks in
identifying and clearing the many outstanding matters which needed to be
resolved, including legal points on the transfer of undertakings. A
programme had been agreed to address these issues. He hoped an offer would
be made before the end of March.

FT  04 FEB 94 / TSB to pre-notify all fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group said yesterday that it intended to become the first bank to
pre-notify its personal customers of all charges on current accounts,
including those for returned cheques and letters written by managers.
The bank said it was introducing full pre-notification of charges
immediately. Along with National Westminster Bank, it now pre-notifies
customers of selected charges including overdraft interest payments and
fees.
Banks have been moving towards pre-notification of charges on monthly
statements, and the voluntary code of practice adhered to by all large banks
is expected to be revised shortly to include pre-notification.
Mr Ian Hall, TSB's marketing manager for cheque accounts, said that it had
been the first large high street bank to introduce partial pre-notification
in October 1992, but believed that was an inadequate service. 'We will now
be telling them (customers) about unexpected charges which they have no way
of calculating,' said Mr Hall.
Barclays has said it intends to introduce pre-notication, and Lloyds has
said that it will pre-notify charges this year.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Brazil's finance minister in second setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Problems mounted yesterday for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's
finance minister, when Congress delayed voting on a key part of his economic
stabilisation plan.
It was Mr Cardoso's second setback in less than a week and led to a swirl of
rumours that he may be resigning. The minister later denied this. He
announced last night he would go on TV on Monday to call again for support
in Congress.
Mr Cardoso sought congressional approval for an emergency fund to help
balance the budget. But opposition from political opponents and state
governors led Congress to delay the vote until next week.
The delay yesterday could threaten the timeframe for Mr Cardoso's entire
economic plan as the Carnival holiday is likely to prevent a quorum forming
in Congress until the end of February. This in turn threatens a March 10
deadline for the IMF to approve Brazil's private bank debt restructuring
deal. An IMF team was due to arrive in Brazil yesterday to review progress
on balancing the budget.
The setback follows a similar snub last week when Congress did not vote
through his recommended tax increases.
Members of Mr Cardoso's Social Democratic Movement party are thought to have
urged him to resign to run in October's presidential elections. But foreign
investors and businessmen are uneasy about this as he is seen as one of the
few politicians able to retain cross-party support in tackling inflation.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Pratt &amp; Whitney in JAL deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US yesterday clinched a Dollars 400m (Pounds 266.6m)
engine order to power Japan Airlines' fleet of new Boeing 777 wide-bodied
aircraft against fierce competition from its US rival General Electric and
from Rolls-Royce of the UK.
JAL's decision is a bitter blow for both the UK aero-engine maker and GE in
the three-way battle to sell high thrust engines to power the new generation
of wide-bodied aircraft expected to account for an increasing share of the
world market during the next 10 years.
P&amp;W, a subsidiary of the United Technologies conglomerate, conceded
yesterday that the competition for the JAL order had been 'a nail biter',
although the US company had been the favourite to win.
The deal comes at a time when large engine and commercial aircraft orders
continue to be scarce because of the financial problems of many airlines,
and the three engine manufacturers are having to invest heavily in the
development of engines with thrusts of more than 100,000 lbs.
The battle for the 40 engines to power the 20 Boeing 777s ordered by JAL
pitched P&amp;W's PW4084 engine against the GE90 and Rolls-Royce Trent 800.
The win now gives P&amp;W 51 per cent of the market so far for 777 engines
compared with 29 per cent for GE and 20 per cent for Rolls-Royce.
The UK company yesterday admitted it was disappointed but said it had always
regarded the competition as 'very difficult'.
P&amp;W has now secured the engine market for all 777s ordered by Japanese
carriers. Both All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System had already selected
the PW4084 engine to power their 777s.
This was one of the decisive factors in JAL's selection of the P&amp;W engine
because the three Japanese carriers are seeking to reduce operating costs
through a joint maintenance programme for their new aircraft and engines.
The new Boeing 777 will be rolled out for the first time next April. The
first aircraft is due to enter service next year with United Airlines of the
US having P&amp;W engines.
Rolls-Royce, which is investing about Pounds 400m in the development of the
Trent, last week announced it had set a new world commercial engine power
record by running its Trent 800 at 106,000 lbs of thrust. This topped the
previous record set by the GE90 at 105,400 lbs of thrust.
But the commercial success of the Trent has not matched the engine
programme's technical achievements.
Rolls-Royce has so far won orders and options for 100 Trent 800 engines to
power Boeing 777 aircraft ordered by Cathay Pacific, Emirates and Thai
International.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: America lays ghosts of its war in Vietnam
 -Twenty years on, ending of the trade embargo has closed a chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American presidents sometimes act out of character when occasion demands.
Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism, launched the Marshall Plan and Nato
to put war-shattered Europe back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan, cold war warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co-operation
and communication with China and the former Soviet Union respectively.
By these historical standards, there is something both consistent and
logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under the Vietnam War by his
decision last night to end the trade embargo. This is a president, after
all, who never served in uniform and, as a young man, publicly opposed the
war. There was even a time early in the 1992 campaign when, because of his
evasion of the draft, it seemed he might become its latest victim, nearly 20
years after military hostilities had ceased.
Yet so powerful are the emotions still stirred by the only war the US can
definitively be said to have 'lost' in 200 years that Mr Clinton did not
rush into normalising relations with Vietnam. Instead he carefully built up
political constituencies at home and patiently followed the general road map
laid out by George Bush, another president who, in the first flushes of
victory after the Gulf War, must surely have been tempted also to come to
terms with Vietnam.
America's Vietnam casualty list is long indeed, since President John
Kennedy's fateful steps to contain the communist tide over 30 years ago. It
must begin with the 67,000-plus soldiers who never came home and the many
more who returned maimed in body and mind, the first returning US soldiers
not to be welcomed as conquering heroes.
It took many years, and more controversy, for their sacrifice finally to be
recognised in the shape of the Vietnam Memorial on the Washington Mall. It
is a recognition like no other - a long low dark gray wall etched with the
names of everyone who died - and its juxtaposition next to the heroic and
classical Lincoln Memorial speaks volumes.
The plight of the dead and the survivors is now embedded in popular culture,
recognised in films and books beyond number. Words and images from that era
still resonate - the 'domino theory,' Agent Orange, the Tet offensive, the
My Lai massacre and subsequent trial of Lt William Calley, the pictures of
the little Vietnamese girl burning from napalm, of the execution of a
captured Vietcong and of helicopters whirring above the US embassy in Saigon
as the last Americans were evacuated.
Few, if any, generations, have been so seared by a foreign conflict which
found the nation so divided. The chalice inherited by the 'best and the
brightest' in government, who flocked to Washington with Kennedy and mostly
stayed with Johnson, was poisoned.
Many tuned out and turned off, their contributions to society so much less
than they might have been. A few sought consolation in different forms of
public service - like Robert McNamara who, perhaps, salved his wounds and
guilt as defence secretary with two distinguished terms as president of the
World Bank. But he rarely spoke about Vietnam and only now is putting
together memoirs of the period.
Political victims abound. Lyndon Johnson, faced with turmoil in the streets
of Washington and around his country, decided not to run for re-election in
1968 and died, a broken man, three years later.
His Democratic party, under Hubert Humphrey, not only lost the presidency in
1968 but took years to come to terms with Vietnam, holding the White House
for only four of the next 24 years. In 1972, its presidential nomination was
captured by George McGovern, the anti-war candidate. He went down to an
landslide defeat to Richard Nixon, who, nevertheless, was not above
manipulating the Vietnam peace process on the eve of the election to
maximise his victory (he lost only liberal Massachusetts.)
Four years later, the Watergate scandal helped propel Jimmy Carter into the
White House but he, too, was afflicted by the Vietnam syndrome, this time in
Iran. A botched rescue attempt in the spring of 1980 of the US hostages in
Tehran came to seem pathetically indecisive when compared to Ronald Reagan's
blunt assertion that he would set 'a date certain' for release of the
hostages, in the absence of which US bombs would start falling.
Subsequent Republican presidents seemed to have learned this lesson better,
committing themselves to the doctrine of 'main force', winning little
victories in Grenada and Panama and a big one in the Gulf, and proclaiming
with each notch on the belt that the Vietnam nightmare was over and that US
forces would now be allowed by the politicians to win wars. But this did not
help George Bush in 1992.
Nor is it clear that their contention is valid. There is no evidence of
American appetite for foreign military adventure, be it in Bosnia, Somalia
or anywhere not incontrovertibly related to the national interest.
This may be ascribed to the end of the Cold War and the imperatives of
domestic renewal. But it may also be the real final legacy of Vietnam. 'No
more war' was a powerful chant in the streets of America in 1968. It would
still be so today.

<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A nationwide strike called by Ecuador's main trades union federation to
protest against increases in petrol prices yesterday shut public and private
enterprises and hit public transport.
The United Workers Front is demanding a reversal of the petrol price rise,
which was announced at the weekend. It is also seeking a general increase in
wages for workers and the dismissal of Mr Cesar Robalino, the finance
minister. Riots continued for the third day yesterday.
In an attempt to overcome a fiscal crisis, the government of President Sixto
Duran raised petrol prices by 25-71 per cent. Now prices stand at Dollars
1.22-Dollars 1.46 (Pounds 0.81-Pounds 0.97) a US gallon. Public transport
prices remain fixed through subsidies.
Mr Alfredo Corral, labour minister, said the government was 'studying the
possibility of a limited wage increase,' but would not repeal the petrol
price rises.
Union leader Mr Edgar Ponce reiterated his members' opposition to
privatisation of strategic state-owned enterprises; if the government did
not give in to the demands, an indefinite general strike and an uprising by
the indigenous peoples 'could result'.
The government maintains that an estimated Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m deficit
in the projected 1994 budget was largely caused by the fall in the price of
crude oil, exports of which make up nearly half of the government's
revenues.

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Trade accord boost for global
standardisation - Common technical, health and safety standards to
facilitate the free flow of goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global trade accords concluded in the Uruguay Round last December will
give a big boost to the power and prestige of the numerous international
organisations concerned with the setting of technical, health and safety
standards for industrial and agricultural products.
New agreements on food safety and animal and plant health regulations, and
on technical barriers to trade, urge governments to make maximum use of
international standards to prevent unnecessary obstacles to the free flow of
goods.
Unlike the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's current voluntary
'standards' code, which has about 40 signatories, the strengthened Uruguay
Round accords will apply to all 115 Gatt members. Moreover, the dispute
settlement mechanism which will come into force with the new World Trade
Organisation next year will give governments better redress against the use
of standards as disguised trade barriers.
The Uruguay Round accord on technical barriers to trade, which covers
non-farm goods, requests countries to use international standards where they
exist unless 'ineffective or inappropriate' for the task.
It also encourages them to join and participate actively in the 28 or so
international standards-setting bodies, especially the Geneva-based
International Organisation for Standardisation and its sister institution,
the International Electrotechnical Commission, which sets standards in
electrical and electronic engineering.
The agreement can be expected to reinforce the impact of expanding world
trade, globalisation of production and the increasingly rapid development of
new products and technologies which have already prompted a big rise in
demand for international standards to ensure worldwide compatibility.
This has been magnified in recent years, according to Mr Lawrence Eicher,
ISO secretary general, by the spread of regional trading blocs, the
integration of developing and former communist countries into the world
trading system, and recognition of the need to avoid new trade barriers as
tariff walls crumble.
ISO, a federation of 100 national standards bodies, has published more than
9,000 standards since it was set up in 1947, covering everything from screw
dimensions and container sizes to car bumper heights and ski-boot bindings.
Between them ISO and IEC, which has 42 active members, produce about 800 new
and revised international standards each year.
In ISO's early days, the emphasis was on harmonisation of national
standards. Now, increasingly, industry does not bother to formulate a
national standard but asks immediately for an international one.
This process has gone furthest in the European Union which decided near the
outset of its single market programme that it was not going to repeat at an
international level the trauma of harmonising standards across the 12
members.
Since 1991, the EU's standards bodies - Cen (European Committee for
Standardisation) and Cenelec (European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardisation) - have worked in parallel with ISO and IEC, producing the
same or consistent standards which are issued simultaneously. For
electrotechnical standards the overlap is already nearly 90 per cent and for
other international standards it is 40-50 per cent.
Apart from saving time and effort in standards development, the EU move
represents a big competitive advantage for European companies which can
avoid the cost and inefficiency of playing to different sets of rules for
the domestic and export market. The lesson has not been lost on members of
other groupings, including the North American Free Trade Agreement which
links the US, Canada and Mexico.
US companies have historically taken relatively little interest in
international standards because they could prosper in the huge home market.
As the importance of trade to the US economy has grown, so too have problems
caused by a lack of standardisation.
Many US companies, for instance, still operate on the imperial system of
weights and measures, 20 years after most of the rest of the world went over
to metric.
Harmonisation of technical standards between the US and Canada under their
1988 bilateral free trade agreement has proved an arduous task, aggravated
by the contrasting standards-setting systems. The US has several hundred
industry and local government organisations contributing to national
standards, while Canada has just a few standards-writing bodies.
The Nafta accord attempts to avoid adding unduly to these problems by
requiring national standards to be based on international ones. Any more
stringent measures will have to be harmonised at regional level.
The growing emphasis on international standards has made the writing of
those standards itself a highly competitive industry. Under ISO procedures,
if at least five countries agree to participate actively in developing a
standard, a technical committee is set up with one of those countries
providing the secretariat.
There is strong country rivalry for these secretariats, since it increases
the chances that the international standard will reflect the priorities of
the domestic industry.

FT  04 FEB 94 / US insurers face bill for toxic waste fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is proposing to set up a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn)
fund paid for by the insurance industry as part of its overhaul of the
controversial Superfund laws governing the clean-up of toxic waste sites.
Ms Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said
yesterday that the new fund, to be built up by a levy on the industry
starting at a total Dollars 500m a year, would help settle insurance claims
arising from waste dumped before 1986, when the Superfund law was revised,
and cut down on lawsuits.
The administration's draft legislation would also set up a new form of
arbitration process for allocating responsibility for cleaning up waste
sites, under the auspices of an independent expert, and make other changes
that it hopes would resolve some of the law's current problems in assigning
liability.
Superfund legislation was first passed in 1980 amid public outcry over
notorious dumps such as Love Canal, near the Niagara Falls, or Kentucky's
Valley of the Drums.
Its operation, however, has been widely criticised for the unfairness with
which liability is distributed, the slowness of clean-ups - only 217 of the
1,280 sites listed as national priorities have been declared clean - and the
amount of time and money spent on litigation.
A study last year by the Rand Corporation, a California-based think-tank,
estimated that transaction costs ate up 27 per cent of the money spent on
clean-ups.
'We all need Superfund reform desperately. No one who knows anything about
Superfund would dispute that,' said Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the
Senate committee on the environment.
Ms Browner said the administration's proposals would make clean-ups quicker
and cheaper. 'Our proposal will cut the length of clean-up by 10 to 20 per
cent and the cost of clean-up by up to 25 per cent,' she said.
The draft legislation aims to introduce some consistency by setting up
national standards for clean-ups, although these standards will vary
according to the future use of the land.
One of the most controversial aspects of Superfund has been the application
of joint and several liability, in which companies which contributed only a
little to the pollution of a site may end up being saddled with most of the
bill because other polluters have gone out of business.
The administration bill retains joint and several liability, which is a
well-established legal principle, but Ms Browner said the new procedure for
allocating responsibility would allow businesses to settle their share and
not worry about being sued by others.
Joint and several liability was the inducement to take part in the
allocation process, since those who did not settle could end up being sued
for the leftover costs, or orphan share, which cannot be allocated to a
specific party.
Very small polluters - some households have faced a Superfund bill because
their rubbish was taken away to a landfill - will be absolved of liability,
and other small polluters will be given the opportunity to settle early.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's international monetary reserves fell sharply last month after a
rush into US dollars prompted by the failure of the country's second largest
bank, Banco Latino, and as a result of lower receipts from oil exports.
The central bank said international reserves dropped by Dollars 744m (Pounds
496m) in January, or 5.8 per cent, to Dollars 11.9bn at the end of the month
 -after falling by only Dollars 513m during the whole of last year. Reserves
are still sufficient to cover the 1993 import bill.
Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the finance minister, said that the new government,
which took office on Wednesday, wanted to refinance around '15-20 per cent'
of the principal payments on its non-restructured public sector external
debt maturing this year. This would not affect any Venezuelan bond issues.
The central bank also said the cost of living index rose by 4.3 per cent in
January, a bad start for the year. The rise, compared with 3 per cent in
January 1993, resulted from the application of a new value added tax to
retail sales. Inflation last year was 46 per cent.
Ministers said on Wednesday that the government of President Rafael Caldera

inflation and avoid shortages, and that a price increase for petrol
(contemplated in the 1994 budget) would not be approved 'over the short

FT  04 FEB 94 / Business snubs Clinton health bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first week of the Clinton administration's renewed drive for healthcare
reform has brought a mixture of tactical defeats, victories and draws in its
battle for universal coverage.
The most significant setback was the decision on Wednesday by the Business
Roundtable, an association of 200 prominent corporate heads, to endorse the
more modest reform bill sponsored by Congressman Jim Cooper, the Democrat
from Tennessee.
The White House conceded it was 'disappointed but not surprised' that it had
failed in its strenuous efforts to get the association to preserve its
previous neutrality. It suggested the Roundtable had been unduly influenced
by the arguments of the insurance industry against universal coverage.
The Cooper plan is the only alternative which has attracted measurable
bipartisan backing in Congress. It does not require universal coverage,
though the congressman argues that his blueprint creating insurance
purchasing alliances for small businesses, many of whom now provide no
coverage, would have virtually the same effect. He also sees many other
similarities with the administration approach, including reliance on what is
known as 'managed competition.'
Its attraction to big business is that it would not force companies to
purchase insurance for their employees, nor would it allow the government to
put ceilings on insurance premiums, both features of the administration
plan.
While sticking to his threat to veto any legislation that does not provide
universal coverage and while working to prevent a rush of support for the
Cooper bill, President Bill Clinton this week has indicated willingness to
compromise on other parts of his plan, including employer mandates.
This gesture was influential in persuading the nation's governors, meeting
in Washington this week, to issue a strong call for passage of healthcare
reform this year. But they endorsed none of the plans currently on the table
and admitted they were hopelessly divided on whether employers should be
required by law to provide insurance.
Nevertheless the mood of the governors, plus the evidence of public opinion
polls, has already induced a large tactical shift in the Republican
position. Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, this week significantly
modified his assertion of seven days ago that there was no healthcare crisis
in the US and promised to work for reform, even though he predicted 'it
won't look like any bill out there now.'
Polls taken since the president's State of the Union message last week all
indicate majority backing for Mr Clinton's broad goal, but they also reveal
much incomprehension. Mr Dole's volte face demonstrates Republican awareness
of the problems the party could face if it is perceived to be obstructing
the popular will.

The Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday unanimously approved the

Mr Perry, previously deputy secretary, struck all the right notes in his
hearings and was gently treated by Senators. He said he would back US field
commanders, promote internal reorganisation and seek more defence funds if
necessary (he estimated a current five-year budget gap of Dollars 20bn, less
than the Dollars 50bn pointed to by Mr Les Aspin, outgoing secretary).
He promised to be a full player in the Clinton administration's often
criticised foreign and security team, expressing strong concern about North
Korea's attempt to acquire nuclear capability.

Davy Process Technology, a division of Trafalgar House, has won a Pounds
235m (Dollars 352m) contract to build a methanol plant in Trinidad and
Tobago, just days after handing over a similar facility to the Caribbean
Methanol Company.
The decision to more than double the country's methanol capacity was taken
because of the low cost of gas in Trinidad and its proximity and favoured
access to the growing US market.
The US economic recovery and the resulting rise in housebuilding has boosted
demand for timber resins based on methanol.

<TEXT>
Jordan has asked the Iranian embassy in Amman to cut down its numbers
drastically amid fears that Tehran is strengthening its links with Moslem
fundamentalists in Jordan and the West Bank.
Security officials in Amman complained the size of the Iranian embassy far
outweighed its 'normal' functions and the Iranian ambassador, Mr Ahmad
Dastmalchian, is said to have played an active role in 1979's Iranian
student takeover of the US embassy in Tehran and the 1983 suicide attack on
the US mission in Beirut.
Diplomats in Amman said Mr Dastmalchian is known to have played a key role
in strengthening links between Tehran and Moslem fundamentalists abroad. The
Iranian embassy in Amman has 30 staff, including 19 diplomats, compared with
only two Jordanian diplomats in Tehran.
Jordan's request came a few days after a bomb exploded in a cinema screening
soft pornography in the northern town of Zarqa in which two people were
injured. A similar device exploded five days earlier in a downtown cinema in
Amman, injuring seven.
Western embassies in Egypt are tightening security after warnings by Moslem
militants that foreigners should leave Egypt, Reuter reports from Cairo.

FT  04 FEB 94 / National party woos voters across racial divide: 'Forget
apartheid' is gist of South African ruling party's election manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Apartheid - let's forget about it,' says Victor Gumbi, a black organiser
for South Africa's ruling National party, the party which forced him to live
in the black township of Soweto, denied him basic human rights and gave him
third-class education and healthcare for decades, but nonetheless wants his
vote in April's all-race elections.
Yesterday, in the presence of 3,000 delegates including perhaps a third
'non-white', the new non-racial National party published an election
manifesto which can be summarised in exactly the phrase chosen by Victor:
forget apartheid.
The party congress, held outside Johannesburg, was a surreal affair.
National party politicians, uncertain how to communicate with their new
black, brown and Indian supporters, borrowed the rhetorical tricks of the
African National Congress to try to stir the moribund conference to life.
The effort fell flat. The cries of 'Viva, President de Klerk, Viva' and
'Long live' stimulated a few uncomfortable whites to give the clenched-fist
black power salute; but most delegates offered no more than muted applause.
They seemed slightly bemused by the proceedings.
Desperate to gain the black, coloured and Indian votes without which the
party is doomed, the NP loaded its election list with 'non-white'
candidates, many of them politicians who served in the tricameral parliament
(which gave coloureds and Indians the vote, but excluded blacks), or people
with little political experience. The list for the northern Transvaal region
is overwhelmingly black, and in the crucial Pretoria-Johannesburg region the
seventh position is held by a black man, Mr David Chuenyane, who chaired the
congress.
So why did Mr David Chuenyane join the National party, especially after
decades in exile with the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress? 'I'm an
opportunist,' he says with a candour rare among his white colleagues. 'I saw
an opportunity in the NP and I said: 'The NP is stranded. They need somebody
black'.' Anyway, he adds, there were no good positions going in the African
National Congress.
Now the NP is trying to sell itself as a party with experience of government
(apparently oblivious to the charge that 40 years' experience implementing
apartheid scarcely inspires confidence for the future). The party's
manifesto solemnly promises to protect exactly those basic freedoms which
National party governments abused on a regular basis for more than 40 years.
Nobody would deny it is a tall order to sell a party with a history like
that of the National party (Mr Tim Bell, of Thatcher election fame, is
advising the NP in its efforts). But the black South Africans who decide in
the end to vote NP will not mind about that: they will be voting to keep out
the Xhosas, who are perceived to dominate the ANC; they will be registering
a protest at political violence which some blame on the ANC; or they will
betray a kind of inverted racism, bred by apartheid, which has left some
older, traditional, blacks thinking only whites can govern.
The size of this support base is impossible to measure, least of all by
opinion polls conducted in an atmosphere of political violence, where
respondents often say they are undecided rather than risk revealing their
views. Opinion polls published yesterday indicated 25 per cent of the
electorate is undecided; earlier polls showed only 1 per cent black support
for the NP, although support among coloured and Indians is substantial.
It seems a fair bet that President FW de Klerk's confidence is misplaced
when he predicts that the NP will win the election outright; but however
difficult his campaign, and however bitter the irony of his message, some
black Africans will vote for him as the man who ended apartheid. It is an
irony of history that his party should depend on the ones who suffered most
under National party rule for its very survival in the new South Africa.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Beijing seeks veto over HK air pact
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An air services agreement between Cathay Pacific Airlines and China
Airlines, Taiwan's flag carrier, seems likely to become ensnared in the
long-running dispute between China and Taiwan about reunification.
It is unclear what attitude Beijing will take to the renewal of the
agreement which expires in April next year. Although the accord is between
two companies, China has indicated to the Hong Kong government that it wants
to approve the terms.
Taiwan's Nationalist government refuses to permit direct contacts with the
mainland. Most of the island's trade and communications with the mainland
are routed through Hong Kong. More than 1m visits a year to mainland China
by Taiwanese businessmen and tourists could be affected if China refused to
recognise the agreement.
Renegotiation is China's first concrete opportunity to exercise economic
leverage on the Taipei government. It might use the aviation accord to force
the pace of discussions about direct links across the Taiwan Strait.
Air services between Hong Kong and Taiwan are not governed by a bilateral
government agreement, but by an inter-company one last renegotiated by
Cathay and China Airlines in April 1990 and valid for five years. This
agreement permits both airlines to fly between Hong Kong and Taipei, and
Hong Kong and Kaohsiung, a large port in south-west Taiwan.
The airlines want to renegotiate the pact for a further five years. But
China has told the Hong Kong government informally that it wants to see the
terms of any agreement, as it will span the 1997 transfer of the colony's
sovereignty to China.
According to a senior government official: 'The Chinese are concerned about
what arrangements go through 1997 and they do not expect to see something
agreed, that does go beyond 1997, without their blessing'.
Although the agreement between Cathay and China Airlines was a matter
between two private companies, in reality it would need China's endorsement
to have any force after 1997, the official added.
The Taiwanese government has said it wants to continue using Hong Kong as a
buffer between the island republic and the mainland. But it has said it will
develop Subic Bay, the former US naval base in the Philippines, as a
transshipment port if Beijing denies it access to Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
South Africa's right-wing Freedom Alliance will take the weekend to consider
a compromise offer made in constitutional talks yesterday with the African
National Congress and government, but Alliance negotiators said the offer
fell short of their demands, writes Patti Waldmeir.
The offer would allow voters in April's elections to choose different
parties at regional and national level, rather than voting once for one
party to rule at both levels. The ANC made the concession hoping to avert
civil conflict. Other items fell well short of Alliance demands: on regional
autonomy, no new offer was made, though ANC negotiators made clear a
readiness to move further on this issue, which is crucial to any settlement.
There is intense dispute within the ANC on how much autonomy to offer.
Talks must end by next Saturday, the day on which parties must register if
they are to contest April's elections.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Few prospects in sight for an IMF agreement with Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund ended its annual visit last night with no
prospect of agreement between Nigeria and its official creditors until the
new military government brings spending, inflation and the foreign exchange
rate under control. But economists predict that some policies in last
month's budget will undermine economic stability.
Since late 1990 western-backed deregulation of Nigeria's economy has lapsed
whilst fiscal policy has been out of control, leading to a budget deficit
estimated at N100bn (Pounds 3bn) last year, about 15 per cent of GDP.
'The only thing which they deregulated in the past two years was government
spending,' said an economist in Lagos.
Officials say the Fund supported this government's policies of balancing the
budget and accounting for all revenue and spending, but will not return for
further talks until General Sani Abacha's regime achieves its targets in the
coming months.
Nigeria is set to accumulate arrears of Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.7bn) by the
year end on external debts of around Dollars 28bn and more than half is
rescheduled debt to the Paris Club of official creditors, which it has not
serviced since August 1992. Debt relief depends on either a standby
agreement lasting nine to 18 months or a three-year enhanced structural
adjustment agreement (ESAS) with the IMF.
An ESAS would require comprehensive reform of the public sector but a
standby deal could be reached more quickly if the government stabilises the
economy and adopts fiscal, monetary, credit and foreign exchange policies
which the Fund considers appropriate.
Since seizing power in November the direction of Gen Abacha's regime has
been unclear. In last month's budget it reverted to direct allocation of
foreign currency and fixed foreign exchange and lending rates, ignoring
advice from international creditors. Foreign accounts have been frozen since
the budget and until the cabinet's civilian economic committee begins to
allocate foreign exchange direct to end users at a fixed rate of N22 to the
dollar. Bank lending rates have been capped at 21 per cent although
inflation is believed to be around 80 per cent.
This year's budget accounts more clearly for oil revenue than in the past
but the government has not released payment for four months to its foreign
oil joint venture partners which are owed an estimated Dollars 700m plus
N3bn.
Observers say that economic policy is largely determined by a cabinet
committee containing several populist politicians with ambitions for high
office, after the military leaves power, who may be reluctant to cut public
spending.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday strongly rejected US censure of its human rights record,
describing such criticism as 'utterly unreasonable and totally
irresponsible'.
China's strong reaction to this latest US criticism of its human rights
record reflects concerns about renewal of its Most Favoured Nation status.
Removal of its lower tariff privileges in the US market would threaten
billions of dollars' worth of textile sales.
In response to a US State Department report this week which said that
China's human rights behaviour still fell 'far short' of internationally
accepted standards, Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said: 'The US has no right to make irresponsible remarks about the internal
affairs of China or, for that matter, any other country. We resolutely
oppose interference in our internal affairs under the excuse of human
rights.'
The annual State Department accounting of human rights in China criticised
Beijing for failing to provide adequate protection for individuals under the
terms of the constitution.
'Fundamental human rights provided for in the Chinese constitution
frequently are ignored in practice,' the report said. 'Challenges to the
Communist party's political authority are often dealt with harshly and
arbitrarily.'
The State Department report acknowledged China had made positive moves on
human rights in 1993, but it was the report's negative tone which captured
the headlines.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Volatile Japanese politics plunged into turmoil again:
Hosokawa's unexpected move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese politics was again plunged into turmoil yesterday as the
controversial tax plans of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, aroused
outrage on all sides.
Mr Hosokawa's early morning announcement of an income tax cut, to be funded
by a rise in sales tax from the current 3 per cent to 7 per cent in three
years' time, astonished many in his seven-group coalition and the opposition
Liberal Democratic party. Japanese politics has moved into a newly
unpredictable phase, and nobody had expected any kind of a decision, let
alone such a blunt one, at that moment.
Less than a week after averting a political crisis by compromising with the
LDP on political reform, Mr Hosokawa has provoked fresh trouble by
apparently underestimating the political impact of his tax plan. This has
forced him to delay announcement of his economic pump-priming package and
attracted, for the first time, Japanese press criticism of his leadership
style.
The Asahi Shimbun newspaper yesterday accused Mr Hosokawa of dishonesty and
conceit, while the Mainichi Shimbun doubted whether Mr Hosokawa's 74 per
cent popularity rating would be enough to resolve this crisis. 'The prime
minister must have been drunk on his high poll ratings,' said an angry Mr
Kozo Igarashi, the construction minister, who belongs to the Social
Democratic party.
Yet most analysts think the basic plan, worked out by the three centre-right
parties which set the tone for coalition policy, will survive. 'It's a
purely emotional outburst. This is just Kabuki (theatre). There will be an
agreement because nobody wants an election,' said Mr Jesper Koll, chief
economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Mr Hosokawa yesterday offered to consider changing the plan to satisfy the
left-wing SDP, the largest member of the coalition, after it threatened to
leave the government unless he modified the scope and timing. 'I am not
concerned about saving face,' he said yesterday, after angry SDP officials
invaded his private office.
A wholesale walk-out by the 76 SDP lower house members would deprive the
coalition of its 10-seat majority there. 'The socialists don't want to leave
unless they have to . . . they don't want to take the government away from
Mr Hosokawa just yet,' argued Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at Salomon
Brothers Asia.
Mr Hosokawa was probably expecting the SDP to resist the plan, given the
party's election pledge last year to oppose any rise in sales tax. But the
criticism from other coalition members and from parts of the LDP - which,
ironically, introduced consumption tax - was a surprise.
Even Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, and an open advocate of
an increase in indirect taxation, threatened to resign if Mr Hosokawa did
not mollify the socialists. 'It is better to correct major errors. We may
have rushed the decision on the tax,' he said.
The plan had been announced too suddenly and was 'not even worth
discussing', said Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's policy
research council. Only a day earlier the LDP looked as if it was firmly
behind Mr Hosokawa on tax, on the strength of an agreement between him and
Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president.
Mr Hashimoto's remark appears odd from a former minister at the Finance
Ministry, which orchestrated the consumption tax rise. Another former LDP
finance minister, Mr Michio Watanabe, welcomed the scheme as 'the sole
direction' the government can take. All this suggests the LDP is just as
split over tax as is the coalition.
The campaign by the powerful Finance Ministry for a rise in sales tax
clearly won over Mr Hosokawa. The ministry argues that it needs to increase
revenues from indirect taxation to make up for the decline in income tax
revenues that will take place as the number of Japanese aged over 65
increases from 12 per cent now to nearly 25 per cent by 2025.
Political parties' natural reluctance to take responsibility for raising
taxes is intensified by the LDP's painful memory of the consequence of its
introduction of sales tax in early 1989. That was a big factor in the LDP's
defeat in the upper house elections later that year, the first step in a
decline which culminated in its lower house election defeat last year.
The proposed increase will again have an electoral cost, judging by the
outcry from business and consumer groups yesterday. This is at a time when
political parties are unwilling to take risks because they do not know for
sure when the next general election will be.
Mr Hosokawa clearly believes his hand is strong enough to impose a fresh
balance on the tax system, even at the cost of shocking some of his allies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia, under the spotlight as the US ponders whether to remove trading
privileges, is facing its worst industrial unrest in recent years, diplomats
and labour experts said yesterday, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
Thousands of workers went on strike this week accusing employers of failing
to pay the new minimum wage, forcing President Suharto and his army chief to
enter the fray by warning businessmen to abide by the new ruling.
Indonesia's main independent union has called for a nationwide strike next
week. 'It's going to get worse before it gets better. It's clear the
government is worried about the extent of this (unrest),' a diplomat said.
Washington, critical of Indonesia's labour policy, will decide on February
15 whether to suspend trading privileges under the Generalised System of
Preferences (GSP).
Indonesia, afraid of similar sanctions from Europe, has passed a flurry of
reforms in the hope of convincing Washington not to act. Last month it
repealed a controversial decree allowing the armed forces to intervene in
labour disputes. It has reformed the only officially recognised union, the
All Indonesia Labour Union, or SPSI, in the hope of broadening its role.
It has ordered a 27 per cent increase in the minimum wage for workers in the
industrial heartland of west Java, effective from January 1. Companies in 10
other provinces must raise their minimum wage by April 1. Executives at PT
Kahatex, a textile factory in Bandung, 80 miles south-east of Jakarta, said
2,000 strikers went back to work yesterday after two days of protest in
which offices were ransacked.
In its annual report on human rights, Washington this week accused Indonesia
of widespread abuses and included a tough criticism of its labour record.
Manpower Minister Abdul Latief has given West Java companies until February
12 to comply with the new wage laws, or face fines.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Hosokawa plan has pleased few and made many unhappy
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After months of intense public haggling over how to finance a substantial
income tax cut, Premier Morihiro Hosokawa has put together a plan that has
pleased few and made many unhappy.
What relief or joy over the cut in direct taxation there may have been was
strongly overshadowed by widespread discontent over the increase in
consumption tax to 7 per cent from 3 per cent and its likely impact on
consumer sentiment.
Business leaders, on the whole, hoped the lighter tax burden would lift
consumer demand and help kick-start the sagging economy.
Among the most optimistic was Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren,
the leading business federation, who hailed the prime minister's tax reforms
as a bold measure bound to have a favourable impact on the economy. Mr
Hiraiwa said Mr Hosokawa could be given high marks for his reforms to lower
both income and corporate taxes.
Most businessmen were, however, more guarded, while some were concerned that
raising the consumption tax to more than double its present level could lead
consumers to save their extra money rather than spend it, even though the
increase will not come for three years.
Mr Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was
critical. 'Since an increase to 7 per cent could have a negative impact on
the economic recovery, I cannot support the plan right away,' he said.
'People will save the money,' said Mr Naokazu Takeuchi, councillor at the
Consumers' Union of Japan. 'The Japanese people are not stupid. With the
economic outlook still bleak, they won't spend.'
Pessimists argue that with rising employment and pressure from a high yen
and excess manufacturing capacity unabated, reducing the income burden
slightly is not going to trigger a consumption-led recovery. 'It is no
longer an age in which we can consume our way out of recession,' Mr Takeuchi
said.
'It will not be effective in stimulating the economy,' agreed an official at
Rengo, the trade union confederation. 'Postal savings are at a peak, which
shows that people are not spending even though they have the money.'
But the fiercest criticism was reserved for what was seen as the backhanded
way in which the increase in the consumption tax was decided and then
presented to the public as a fait accompli.
'A tax increase is a serious matter, and must be fully debated to win public
approval,' said a union official. 'Remember, the introduction of the
consumption tax nearly brought down the government' under the then-ruling
Liberal Democratic party, he added.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation,
reflected widespread unhappiness with the forceful way in which the increase
was determined. 'The government should do all it can to cut costs first, to
win the approval of the public,' he said.
For Mr Hosokawa, one of the most welcome receptions to his plan came from
the US. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, greeted the tax package as
'a step in the right direction,' although he reserved final judgment until
details became available.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Russia acts on unsound banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian central bank has closed down 19 'unsound' banks over the past
year and is developing an early-warning system to minimise the risk of
future banking crashes.
Ms Nadezhda Ivanova, deputy chief of off-site banking supervision, said that
liquidation committees were examining the banks' whose licences had been
withdrawn to establish what could be recovered by creditors. The central
bank, which late last year cracked down on banks which abused its overdraft
facility, is a leading creditor.
With 2,041 banks as of February 1, Russia's fast growing but highly fragile
commercial banking business has been encouraged by exceedingly low minimum
capital requirements for setting up a bank. The central bank, however, is
now working on raising them.
Ms Ivanova said off-site supervision, which examines data sent to the
central bank by the banks themselves, was being supplemented by a growing
on-site inspectorate.
An agricultural support package revealed yesterday carried a price tag of
Rbs14,000bn, complemented by an extra Rbs14,000bn to be spent on soft loans
for food purchases, and another Rbs6,000bn in loans for farmers, according
to Mr Andrei Illarionov, an adviser to the prime minister. This meant that
at present exchange rates Russia would spend Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn) on
becoming self-sufficient in food, 10 times more than it spent on food
imports last year.

Foreign capital flows into booming east European stock markets look set to
rise further following the launch of a Dollars 200m (Pounds 133.3m)
investment fund for buying shares in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.
The fund is being announced today by CS First Boston, the London-based
investment bank, and Cazenove, the London stockbroker. It will be the
largest so far for institutional and private investment in listed companies
in central and eastern Europe.
Several analysts yesterday voiced concern that eastern European shares may
be overpriced. The Warsaw, Prague and Budapest stock exchanges rose 800 per
cent, 96 per cent and 28 per cent respectively in dollar terms last year.
Following a further 58 per cent increase in the Budapest stock market index
in January, an executive at a Budapest investment bank said yesterday: 'The
market is already overblown and we are already very concerned about it.'
Creditanstalt, a leading Austrian bank, recently warned that Czech share
prices had been driven excessively high by speculative foreign buying.
However, Mr Charles Harman, a CS First Boston managing director, said he was
'optimistic' about subscriptions to the fund. He expects particular demand
from international institutional investors seeking new methods of increasing
their exposure to emerging stock markets. The fund amounts to about 1 per
cent of the total market capitalisation of the Prague, Warsaw and Budapest
stock exchanges, respectively Dollars 14bn, Dollars 3bn and Dollars 1bn at
the end of last year.
A total of Dollars 150m is expected to be raised through marketing the fund
to international institutional investors from next week, with the balance of
Dollars 50m coming from private investors. Shares in the fund and
accompanying warrants are expected to be listed on the London stock exchange
from mid-March.
CS First Boston has been one of the most active investment banks in central
and eastern Europe. It has managed the sale of the Hungarian airline Malev.
In spite of high foreign interest in central European stock markets, there
are few UK investment trusts focused on the region. The Baring Emerging
Europe trust, which raised Dollars 124m at the end of last year, splits its
investments between Mediterranean countries and eastern Europe.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Costa Rica seeks EU banana compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Costa Rica has asked the European Commission to make three important changes
to its proposed banana import regime in an effort to break the deadlock in a
row between Latin American producers and the European Union.
A compromise plan offering Latin producers greater access to the European
banana market was rejected last month after Costa Rica and Guatemala raised
objections.
A condition for accepting the Commission's offer of an import ceiling of
2.1m tonnes of fruit would be for the Latin Americans to drop their
complaint about the EU's banana regime to Gatt.
Costa Rica has asked the Commission to make the new import ceiling take
effect this year rather than early next. The Costa Ricans also called on the
EU to abolish tariffs whereby importers pay Ecu100 (Pounds 79) per tonne for
deliveries within the ceiling and to remove the licensing system.
The tariff and licensing systems are ways of guaranteeing a market in the EU
for higher-cost bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries under
Lome Convention obligations. The UK and France would almost certainly raise
objections to abolition of the licensing system.
Costa Rica's acceptance of the import plan is crucial as the Commission has
already said it would be prepared to leave Guatemala, which represents only
1.5 per cent of the EU market, out of a final deal.
Latin American producers meet in Panama tomorrow to consider a proposal from
Guatemala calling on the Commission to raise the import ceiling but remove
individual country quotas, and reduce tariffs, with the receipts going as
aid to ACP countries. But it also calls for the abolition of the licensing
system.
The Commission has left its offer to the Latin Americans open until February
11 which is the date for circulating a Gatt report on the banana regime -
condemning Lome arrangements - to all Gatt members.
If Guatemala were left out of the final agreement, it could still press
ahead with the Gatt complaint, but it would not have the force of the other
four producers.
Ecuador, which is the largest exporter of bananas to the EU, is unhappy with
the new regime. But it is not a member of Gatt and does not have the power
of the other producers.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Greece may link to Turkish electricity
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece plans to buy electricity from Turkey to cover shortages during peak
demand, ending a long-standing policy of rejecting economic co-operation
with its political rival. The Energy Ministry said DEH, the state power
monopoly, had been asked to submit detailed proposals for linking the Greek
and Turkish grids in Thrace, in north-east Greece.
Greece has turned down a Turkish offer to supply electricity to the eastern
Aegean islands, claiming it would be unacceptable for its tourist industry
to depend on Turkey. Two years ago, talks with the Turkish electricity
authority on linking the grids were called off after details of the plan
appeared in Greek newspapers.
Athens now faces difficulties in boosting capacity at peak periods as its
northern neighbours can no longer supply electricity on demand. A drought in
Albania, where power is produced by hydroelectric plants, has cut
electricity exports. Bulgaria suffers from an energy shortage because of
reduced transfers from Ukraine, while UN sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia have hit output there.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior US and European Commission officials yesterday agreed to set up an
'early warning system' to identify and tackle potential transatlantic trade
disputes.
The first issue to be tackled is an increasing US tendency to set conditions
on the application of national treatment, Brussels officials said. This
could lead to discrimination against European companies investing in the US
in areas such as research and development, they said.
The talks in Brussels were the first effort to meet President Clinton's
pledge on his recent trip to Europe to intensify EU-US co-operation. Both
sides described the talks as productive. The two sides also discussed the
post-Uruguay Round trade agenda, with the US again stating its interest in
including workers' rights and environment policy.
A senior US official said it was important to develop a 'quiet dialogue' to
tackle disputes on audio-visual and public procurement which were not
resolved in last December's Gatt agreement.
Commission officials welcomed the change in tone, but made clear they had no
new offer to make on the audio-visual issue. It was better for the US and
European industries to pursue the matter, one said.
The sub-cabinet level talks also agreed to intensify regulatory
co-operation. A list of possible areas for future discussion includes mobile
satellite phones, pesticides, and environmental waste packaging.
A further area for co-operation includes exchange of views on new
continent-wide information technology programmes being developed in the US
and Europe such as the administration's National Information Infrastructure
programme. 'We want to ensure they do not run counter to each other,' said
one Brussels official.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Foreign tidal wave hits eastern markets: FT writers report
on the western plunge into emergent exchanges of Budapest, Prague and Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tidal wave of foreign money is moving into the stock exchanges of the
former communist countries of eastern and central Europe. Yesterday's news
of the launch of a Dollars 200m (Pounds 133.3m) investment fund underlines
strong western interest in shares quoted in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest.
Heavy buying has accompanied signs of an end to the long post-1989 period of
economic downturn in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Western
institutional purchases have had a particularly sharp effect during the last
few weeks on the Budapest stock exchange, which rose 58 per cent in January.
But several analysts warn that - after heady stock market rises last year
particularly in Warsaw, up 11-fold in zloty terms - the stock exchanges may
be heading for a fall. One expert pointing to pitfalls is Mr Reginald
Duquesnoy, adviser to Prometheus, a small Dollars 10m Dublin-listed fund
specialising in eastern Europe, launched by the London-based Cresvale asset
management company.
He said yesterday foreign investment could push valuations to extreme
levels. 'I was amongst the first to land in Poland, and the sort of process
I would have expected to take 10 years happened in nine months. It went from
incredible value to the most rampant over-valuation I have seen in a long
time. The greatest destroyers of value are the foreigners.'
Mr William Lynne, of specialist London-based investment trust brokers Olliff
&amp; Partners, says it is still early for mainstream UK investors to look at
eastern Europe. 'This is true emerging markets stuff. UK institutional
investors tend to be dominated by pension fund managers, who do not think
they can justify that kind of high-risk, high-return investment.'
CS First Boston, the investment bank launching the Dollars 200m fund,
counters the idea that it will be adding to an unstainable 'wall of money'
moving into eastern Europe. Mr Charles Harman, a managing director of CS
First Boston responsible for central Europe, says the fund's size is
relatively small compared with the estimated Dollars 10bn worth of new stock
issues expected in the three centres during the next 12 months.
These include both privatisation issues and additional capital launches by
companies already quoted on the three exchanges.
The CS First Boston Fund, expected to be spent during the next two to three
months, is to be targeted above all at Prague, where another round of
privatisations later this year could bring to 1,700 the number of quoted
stocks - dwarfing the much smaller Budapest and Warsaw markets.
According to Mr Richard Salzmann, chairman of the Komercni Bank, a leading
Prague bank, foreign purchases of Czech bonds and equities have surged since
last autumn on optimism about the economic and political outlook. Up to
Dollars 400m in foreign portfolio investment is thought to have flowed to
Prague since the stock market was opened in June.
Private investment funds have yet to make an impact in Poland, although
foreign buying makes up about 10 per cent of turnover on the Warsaw stock
exchange. Foreign investors are thought to own 25 per cent of stock market
capitalisation.
Investment activity in Warsaw has generally been through western
government-sponsored funds such as the Dollars 300m Polish American
Enterprise Fund (PAEF). The PAEF has channelled loans and equity to medium
and small businesses, and last year contributed Dollars 50m towards the
Dollars 150m Polish Private Equity Fund (PPEF) for equity investment, some
of which has been in companies preparing for eventual stock market
flotation.
Budapest, with the smallest capitalisation of the three exchanges, has
lately seen a particular speculative flurry. Last week General Electric's
pension fund and two other US investors paid Dollars 23.6m for the 29 per
cent of hotel and spa chain Danubius being privatised by the State Property
Agency.
The shares more than doubled on the first day of trading.
Investors have been trying to follow the example of the Quantum Fund,
controlled by Mr George Soros. Quantum invested Dollars 3m in Hungarian
retail company, Fotex, in 1992 and the shares have since more than doubled.
The question is: can this be repeated?

FT  04 FEB 94 / Georgia set to consider rouble union
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday announced that Georgia would explore the
possibility of joining a controversial new rouble union under negotiation
between Russia and Belarus.
Visiting Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, for a one-day summit with Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the republic's leader, the Russian president also said that
Russia would give war-ravaged Georgia an unspecified loan. Radical Russian
reformers who have mostly left the government have warned that Russia's more
conservative leaders and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman,
are planning to bail out even worse-off former Soviet republics at Russia's
expense.
Mr Yeltsin said Russia and Georgia had agreed to set up a working group to
'weigh the pros and cons' of Georgia's admission to the rouble zone. The
Russian leader also signed a friendship treaty which is an attempt to patch
up relations frayed by Russian support last year for a rebellion by
Georgia's Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia. The treaty pledges that neither
side will use the other's territory for aggressive acts. The Russian
parliament, however, said that the unresolved conflict meant that it could
not ratify the friendship treaty. Mr Yeltsin said he would only submit the
treaty for ratification once the conflict was resolved.
Russia last year was also unable to stop its own rebel territory of Chechnya
from offering hospitality to Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the deposed president
who fought a civil war against Mr Shevardnadze until he committed suicide
late in December.
Reuter adds: Georgian Defence Minister Georgy Karkarashvili was concussed by
a booby-trap bomb yesterday shortly before Mr Yeltsin arrived in Tbilisi.
The explosion came as the minister visited the wrecked flat of his deputy,
Mr Nika Kekelidze, who had been killed by a bomb there hours earlier. A
friend of Mr Kekelidze was also killed and the friend's wife badly wounded.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said that when Mr Karkarashvili, accompanied by
his aides, opened a door in the devastated apartment a grenade fixed to its
handle exploded.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Ukrainian deputies cautious on N-arms accord

The Ukrainian parliament yesterday adopted a carefully worded resolution
which supported President Leonid Kravchuk's nuclear diplomacy, but delayed
ratification of treaties to rid Ukraine of its nuclear arsenal.
The brief, two-point resolution called for 'exchanging instruments of
(Start-1) ratification after concrete agreements have been reached,'
referring to the still unfinished or 'secret' accompanying agreements on
financial compensation, dismantlement aid and security guarantees.
The MPs stressed the need for these further agreements even though, in their
apparently contradictory resolution, they officially renounced the 13
conditions set on their controversial ratification of Start-1 last November.
Only three weeks ago, the trilateral agreement with Russia and the US was
heralded as an 'historic breakthrough' which would dismantle the world's
third largest nuclear arsenal.
Mr Kravchuk, who has staked his reputation on the trilateral accord, began
with an impassioned appeal to ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as
a non-nuclear state. He said this would avoid 'international isolation'.
Later the president explained that parliament's main concerns would be
fulfilled by the government in subsequent negotiations with Russia and the
US. But parliamentarians wanted to see the compensation and security details
before signalling final approval.
The parliament was only presented with Mr Kravchuk's public agreement signed
with Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin on January 14.
According to this agreement, Ukraine is to ship over 1,600 nuclear warheads
to Russia, where uranium would be extracted and then sold by the US. US
officials have estimated that Ukraine would earn Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m)
from these uranium sales.
The parliament wanted to know precise details of the agreement, wary that it
has still not got compensation for the over 2,000 short-range nuclear
weapons it transferred to Russia in 1992.
Deputies also wanted to ensure their atomic power stations, which produce a
third of the energy-starved country's electricity, would be supplied with
uranium. Shortages of nuclear fuel could shut down part of the Chernobyl
nuclear power station within a week and Ukraine's four other plants within
months.

Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is now 'probable', according to a report
by a prominent British defence institute, writes David White, Defence
Correspondent.
In its annual International Security Review, the Royal United Services
Institute warns of rising tension over the Crimea and Russian nationals
living in Ukraine. It also cites difficulties over the removal of nuclear
weapons from Ukraine and trade, currency and oil disagreements between the
two countries. The institute says the potential for a serious outbreak of
violence is greater in Ukraine than in the Caucasus.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Row in Moscow over spending on agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday illustrated its inclination towards a
course of spending which would fuel inflation and jeopardise economic
recovery.
Mr Andrei Illarionov, whose days may be numbered as personal economics
adviser to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, severely criticised
an agriculture support package as a 'benefit for lobbies' such as the state
farms represented by the deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Zaveriukha.
He said the package, for instance raising duties on imported sugar when
Russian sugar prices were already twice the world level, would hit the
consumer hardest.
Although the package carried an official price tag of Rbs14,000bn, Mr
Illarionov said it would be complemented by an additional Rbs14,000bn to be
spent on soft loans for food purchases, and another Rbs6,000bn in loans for
farmers to carry out the spring sowing. This meant that at present exchange
rates Russia would spend Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn) on its attempts to
become self-sufficient in food - or 10 times more than it spent on food
imports last year - making the goal of self-sufficiency not worth the
expenditure.
Mr Chernomyrdin was quoted as asking the package's authors to review the
programme, saying it had to be backed up by appropriate resources. He did
not explain what constituted appropriate resources in a situation where the
government has already decided to double the amount of money it will print
in the first quarter of this year to cover the budget deficit.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Red tape ties Ossie entrepreneurs: Bureaucracy east Germans
thought was a thing of the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Heidlinde Fatteichar is an energetic east German who expected a lot from
unification. She gathered her savings, exchanged her Ost Marks for D-Marks,
and confronted the market economy.
She leased a small shop in the hamlet of Prebberede in the eastern German
state of Mecklenberg-western Pomerania. The size of a large room, it is
located in the wing of a dilapidated Schloss, or castle, which once belonged
to the old Bassewitz family from Prussia. There are no brash advertising
slogans and banners hanging from the ceilings; no piped, anodyne music.
It is a simple grocery store offering a limited, but adequate, range of
goods for her customers.
But no sooner had the unification treaty been signed than she and her
friends began to realise that some aspects of life had not changed all that
much. The 'Ossies' (the west's scoffing term for easterners) discovered they
were being swamped with just another set of rules, regulations and laws to
replace those they thought they had left behind.
Mrs Fatteichar points to legislation regulating shopping hours. Shops in
Germany must close by 6.30pm on weekdays and 2pm on Saturdays. There are
some exceptions; shops can remain open until 8.30pm on a Thursday -
depending on location - and 4pm on a Saturday, depending on how close they
are to the centre/railway/airport. 'I make my own law,' says Mrs Fatteichar,
who is in her mid-30s. 'Don't talk to me about those west German
regulations. If we took them seriously, we would not be allowed to do
anything. I will stay open as long the people want it.'
She has an acute business sense. She wants to increase her turnover so that
when she moves out - by the end of next month because westerners have bought
the Schloss - she can go to the bank, prove she is creditworthy and lease
new premises.
She is not very hopeful. Not only is Mrs Fatteichar up against antiquated
shopping hours, but the local Raiffeisen bank in Teterow is reluctant to
grant her a loan of DM120,000 (Pounds 46,000) to lease space.
'I can't win with these western German bankers,' she says. 'They want us to
create capital but they will not advance us a loan.' Her bankers have
insisted on security. Mrs Fatteichar has more than obliged. She offered them
her home. But the bank wanted more security. She offered her 10ha of land as
additional mortgage. 'It's still not enough. More and more red tape and
obstacles stand in my way,' she says, adding that she had never before asked
for credit. 'I have no debts.'
Restrictive shopping hours and tight credit restrictions for easterners are
two examples of what many see as an inflexible and rigid economic system
being imposed on east Germans desperate to unleash years of pent-up energy
and channel it into the private sector. It is a view shared by some senior
industrialists.
Mr Kurt Lauk, a board member of Veba, Germany's energy-based conglomerate,
wrote in a recent issue of Daedalus, the journal of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences: 'It is obvious that a competitive renewal in the Federal
Republic presupposes a willingness to . . . contain the flood of state
intervention, to recognise how regulation and licensing can hinder
productivity.' He continued: 'Unfortunately (such regulations) have been
carried over to the new states and greatly complicate the problems for their
economic reconstruction . . . .'
There are some cautious signs that Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister
and member of the liberal Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's governing coalition, is prepared to start cutting through the
myriad of regulations.
Last week the minister scored a small victory. The cabinet, pending approval
by the Bundestag, voted to get rid of the Rabattgesetz - a law, drawn up in
1933, which prevented shops and retailing outlets from lowering their prices
by more than 3 per cent. During the winter and summer sales, retailers will
now be allowed a taste of real competition.
Already the federal association of medium-sized and large retailers is
critical about any reforms. 'Why should we change it?' says Mr Gert Nacken,
one of its legal experts.
'We have enough strong competition. With the present kind of price system,
customers know where they stand. There is stability.'
Many east and west Germans regard the link between price 'stability' and
regulation as tantamount to giving the producer precedence over the
consumer.
There are even some who want to reduce red tape, such as Mr Herbert
Helmrich, justice minister of Mecklenberg-western Pomerania. Twelve years
ago he founded the Society for the Promotion of de-Bureaucratisation. One of
its aims is to speed up decision-making processes by granting civil servants
some powers of initiative without the constant and lengthy reference to
rules and legislation. The federal Justice Ministry has set up a commission
to examine the issue.
Meanwhile, Mrs Fatteichar will continue battling with the bankers and will
ignore red tape to get on with life in a united Germany. 'Sometimes I don't
understand capitalism. Is it meant to be about competition or not?' she
asked.

A fire at a Czech nuclear power plant at Dukovany yesterday revived a row
between Prague and Vienna over the safety of Czech nuclear installations,
writes Patrick Blum in Vienna.
According to a security official at the plant, the fire was caused by a
fault in a transformer and lasted for about two hours, but there was no
radioactive leakage. Later Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said
the fire did not affect nuclear safety, but environmentalists charged that
the fire had been serious enough to cause radioactive leakage. Austria has
called on Prague not to go ahead with the completion of another power plant
at Temelin, near the Austrian border.

Plans for rebuilding Berlin as the fitting capital of a united Germany have
been sharply curtailed by the parliament's budget committee, Reuter reports
from Bonn. The committee agreed on Wednesday evening that all ministries
should be housed in existing buildings, either former east German ministries
or military headquarters left behind by departing Allied forces.
Only the new chancellery and government press office, due to be constructed
near the old Reichstag parliament building, were not mentioned in the
resolution. This implied they would be built, committee members said.
Union membership in Germany fell again last year, with members grouped under
the German federation of unions down by 6.3 per cent, to 10.3m, Reuter
reports from Dusseldorf.

The European Commission yesterday said it would carry out a inquiry into
whether the French government's capital injection of FFr2bn (Dollars 330m)
into Aerospatiale would distort competition and therefore constitute illegal
state aid, David Buchan writes from Paris. Aerospatiale said it needed the
addition to its current capital which is FFr6bn or less than half its
FFr15bn debt. But it was confident that the capital increase would win
Brussels' approval, given that the company had last year considerably
retrenched on its FFr2.38bn loss of 1992 and hoped to move into profit by
1995.

Bobinski from Warsaw. Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, last week
dismissed Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy minister, against the wishes of Mr
Marek Borowski, the finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the
economy, prompting a dispute over control of the Finance Ministry. The
finance and privatisation ministries were allocated to the Left Democratic
Alliance (SLD) while Mr Pawlak, the Peasant Party (PSL) leader, got the post

Lionel Barber adds from Brussels: Mr Pawlak yesterday called for a

Malta yesterday called for an 'immediate' start of accession negotiations to

Fenech Adami, the Maltese prime minister, said in Brussels that his
government would 'in a matter of weeks' meet the European Commission's
requirements for regulatory reforms in financial services, competition and
consumer protection.
The Maltese declaration puts the European Commission and the 12 EU member
states on the spot. Though sympathetic towards Malta's application,
sentiment has leaned toward a delay until the end of enlargement
negotiations with Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway. But Dr Fenech Adami
said Malta intended to ensure the Commission stuck to the conditions set
down on its generally favourable opinion on EU membership issued last year.

</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Palermo public prosecutor has asked for Mr Bruno Contrada, the former
number three in Italy's domestic intelligence service, to be sent for trial
on charges of having links with the Mafia.
Mr Contrada, in charge of all intelligence matters relating to the Mafia,
was arrested on December 24 1992. Since then the Palermo authorities have
turned down all requests for him to be released on bail.
Mr Contrada is the most senior public official to be arrested on charges of
working with Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
His arrest was a direct result of information provided by four of the top
former members of Cosa Nostra who agreed to co-operate with the authorities
 -so-called pentiti.
Palermo magistrates regard a successful prosecution of the Contrada case as
central to the credibility of the pentiti. The latter have become a key
instrument in the Italian state's fight against organised crime and almost
500 are now giving evidence under witness protection programmes. Their
evidence has played an important part in the move by Palermo magistrates to
incriminate former premier Mr Giulio Andreotti over alleged links with the
Mafia.
Mr Contrada is alleged to have passed on sensitive information to Cosa
Nostra. In particular, he is said to have aided Mr Toto Riina, the boss of
Cosa Nostra, captured in January 1993, to avoid arrest. Throughout his
detention Mr Contrada has protested his innocence.
The request to send him for trial came a day after Palermo magistrates
issued 76 arrest warrants in an operation aimed at breaking up the links
between Cosa Nostra and their civilian support networks. The arrests, based
on information supplied by pentiti, included doctors, lawyers and bank
employees.
In neighbouring Calabria, the first of a 1,350 military contingent arrived
yesterday to boost the security forces in their fight against the local
mafia, the 'ndrangheta. On Monday two oficers in the Carabinieri
para-military police were seriously injured in Reggio Calabria in what the
authorities claim was an assassination attempt by 'ndrangheta gunmen.
The weapon used was yesterday identified as the same employed against two
Carabinieri who were killed two weeks ago near Reggio Calabria by the
'ndrangheta.
These attacks are seen as a violent reply by the 'ndrangheta to increasing
police successes against organised crime in the region. But the timing
appears linked to the approaching campaign for general elections.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The two candidates in Sunday's run-off election for the Finnish presidency -
Mrs Elizabeth Rehn and Mr Martti Ahtisaari - are running neck-and-neck,
according to an opinion poll published yesterday.
A Gallup poll in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat gave Mr Ahtisaari, a senior
United Nations diplomat running for the opposition Social Democratic party,
a slight edge for the first time since he won the first round of voting last
month.
The poll gave him 51 per cent against 49 per cent for Mrs Rehn, the
right-of-centre defence minister.
But the poll result was well within the 3 per cent margin for error and was
weighted against the small Swedish-speaking minority to which Mrs Rehn
belongs and which overwhelmingly supports her.
A television poll on Wednesday also showed Mrs Rehn just ahead by 50.5 per
cent to 49.5 per cent. Nevertheless, the polls appeared to confirm a trend
of resurgent support for Mr Ahtisaari, who quickly fell behind in the polls
after the first round of voting.
Both candidates are strong supporters of Finland's application to join the
European Union and have pledged to safeguard neutral Finland's security -
related issues given added potency recently by the rise of nationalist
forces in neighbouring Russia. But Mr Ahtisaari has criticised the
government's economic policies, calling for more state action to combat
unemployment, affecting 20 per cent of the workforce.
His approach seems to have chipped away at the support for Mrs Rehn, whose
candidacy has been the big surprise of the election campaign.
As recently as December she was written off as a marginal outsider, largely
because she represents the Swedish-speaking minority which accounts for only
6 per cent of the population.
But many voters seeking a new style of leadership after three years of deep
recession responded to her appeal as a plain-speaking woman with no
obligations to the main political parties.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Bossi's League ponders alliance with Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The populist Northern League today begins a three-day congress in Bologna to
agree the party's position ahead of Italy's March 27 general elections.
The central issue confronting Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, is
whether to accept an electoral alliance with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media
magnate who entered the political arena last month with his Forza Italia
(Come On Italy) movement.
Mr Berlusconi has made no secret of his desire to forge a 'Liberal Democrat'
electoral alliance with the League. The League's strong presence in northern
Italy, alongside the huge media resources of Mr Berlusconi, is a potentially
attractive combination.
The League had nearly 9 per cent of the vote nationwide in the 1992
elections with a total of 79 members of parliament in both houses.
With the first-past-the-post system the League could obtain some 150 seats
in the chamber of deputies alone. Mr Berlusconi is claiming his own polling
organisations are giving him 30 per cent of the vote.
The League has chosen Bologna for its congress as a provocation to the
former-communist Party of the Democratic Left, which has always regarded the
city as its stronghold.
Mr Bossi has limited the number of potential allies by falling out with the
centrist grouping of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader. Mr Bossi
rejected a deal negotiated by a lieutenant with Mr Segni because he
suspected this would lead to a broader pact with members of the discredited
Christian Democrat party, now renamed Popular party.
In the same way, Mr Bossi has made it clear to Mr Berlusconi that he would
be an unacceptable partner if he were to bring on board the National
Alliance, the recently re-baptised neo-fascist MSI. Mr Bossi regards the
National Alliance and its leader, Mr Gianfranco Fini, as an electoral
liability with whom there is little common ground. Mr Berlusconi is making
progress on a deal with National Alliance.
The other issue to be resolved between Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi is the
number of seats the League is willing to let Forza Italia contest in the
north - and whether Mr Berlusconi should stand in Milan.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Brussels retreat on works councils

The European Commission is watering down its proposal for mandatory elected
works councils in pan-European companies, in an effort to garner business
support.
Instead of a uniform structure for compulsory consultation with workers'
representatives, the new draft directive seeks to induce voluntary
agreements at company level, with unions and employers deciding their own
modus operandi.
'We have gone for the middle course . . . in order to make the proposal more
palatable to the employers' side,' said a senior official close to Mr
Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner.
But if employers and unions fail to agree, then a reduced set of minimum
requirements for consultation will be imposed if workers demand them. 'We
hope the mere threat of imposed conditions induces agreement,' the official
said.
The Commission's original proposal has been blocked for more than three
years by the UK. But Britain's 11 partners decided to press on with the
directive, without the UK, after the Maastricht treaty came into force in
November. But British trans-European companies will still be among those
most affected.
Mr Flynn said: 'The aim of any legislation should be to bring them to the
negotiating table and let them agree whatever they think is best.' He added
that 'the paradox of this directive is that it will succeed best if it is
never applied but that if it did not exist, nothing would happen.'
The senior Commission official said that 'the calculation we've made is that
this is still a text with something in it for everyone'.
But Mr Emilio Gabaglio, general secretary of the European Trade Union
Confederation (ETUC), described the new plan yesterday as 'a complete U-turn
by the Commission' and 'totally unacceptable'.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the Euro-employers
lobby, also dismissed the plan as 'unacceptable' in a letter to Commission
President Jacques Delors. 'The adoption of such a directive . . . will
discourage investment and damage employment prospects,' he said.
Brussels is set to approve the plan next Tuesday, from when Unice and ETUC
will have six weeks to decide whether they can reach an agreement which
obviates the need for the directive. On recent form they are unlikely to do
so, and the Commission expects to get the measure into EU law by the end of
this year. It will still apply to companies with at least 1,000 employees,
and more than a hundred in at least two member states.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Steelmakers hammer Rexrodt: Tough conditions for accord put
before Bonn minister
</HEADLINE>

The German steel federation yesterday set tough conditions for its backing
of a European steel restructuring plan in a meeting with Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
the economics minister.
The conditions included guarantees that steelmakers receiving subsidies to
cut capacity would not be able to increase their shares in the European
steel market and that the agreement would be properly monitored.
'We remain ready to contribute to the European steel restructuring plan. But
politicians must ensure these decisive conditions,' the federation said in a
statement after the meeting.
The federation also insisted that the European steel restructuring scheme
'had not failed yet', but added that the plan 'remained in danger of
failing'.
It appeared eager to tone down pessimistic statements voiced across the
industry, saying that the European steel restructuring plan was doomed
because private steelmakers were not willing to offer significant capacity
cuts.
The European Union plan aims to cut 30m tonnes of crude steel in the
European market.
However, sources in the German steel industry yesterday said that these
conditions were unlikely to be met and that the federation was indulging in
'wishful thinking'.
Officials at Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steel producer, yesterday
reiterated that they would not offer any capacity cuts in flat steel
products.
'We will never give up flat products capacity,' a senior official at the
company said.
Industry sources said no common position had been reached between the big
unsubsidised German producers, which include Krupp-Hoesch and Preussag.
'We still need to talk to one another and it is too early to say what will
come out of these talks,' a leading steel manufacturer said.
Private steelmakers say that they have already implemented large capacity
cuts.
They say capacity cuts in public sector manufacturers do not go far enough
and are allowing subsidised companies to win market shares at the expense of
the private sector.

<TEXT>
Token strikes by tens of thousands of German engineering workers spread
across northern Germany yesterday, in a fourth day of protests in support of
their pay claim.
At the same time, thousands of students continued protest actions against
the government's decision to impose a freeze on their grants until 1996,
instead of increasing them annually by the inflation rate, and to introduce
limits on the length of time they can receive public finance for their
studies. The action by the engineering workers, members of the IG Metall
trade union, was centred on the industrial heartland of North
Rhine-Westphalia and north Germany.
Among the enterprises which suffered work stoppages were the Ford and Opel
car plants in Cologne and Bochum.
Both union leaders and the employers expect negotiations on the union's 5.5
per cent pay claim to begin again next week, although the employers remain
adamant that real cost cuts must be achieved in the current pay round.
The students yesterday won support from the opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD) in Bonn, which promised to introduce a proposal in the
Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, for grants to be increased after
all.
Mr Rainer Ortleb, the federal minister of education, resigned his post
yesterday on the grounds of ill-health.
An east German from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and member of the
minority Free Democratic Party in the ruling coalition, he had been ill
since last November.

FT  04 FEB 94 / PM concedes up to 3% rises in public sector: Concern over
job losses as 'new money' to finance pay increases is ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday backed away from a confrontation with public sector
trade unions by accepting above-inflation pay rises of between 2.75 per cent
and 3 per cent for nearly 1.5m workers.
The settlement follows cabinet approval for reports from pay review bodies
covering teachers, senior civil servants, judges, the armed forces, nurses,
and doctors and dentists.
The review bodies' recommendations will be met in full from April, with the
exception of the armed forces, which will receive part of an average 3.6 per
cent increase from January. The awards compare with inflation of 1.9 per
cent.
The settlement was rushed through by the cabinet to clear the way for a
campaign to restore the government's battered authority before the local and
European elections in May and June. However, a political row was brewing
last night over the extent of job losses needed to finance the pay rises
without breaching a freeze on public sector pay bills announced in the
November Budget.
Mr John Major told MPs in a Commons written answer that there would be no
'new money' to finance the settlement, which will add nearly Pounds 1bn to
the government pay bill. He also ruled out a raid on the government's Pounds
3.5bn contingency reserve. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the
settlement was a theoretical pay rise which would cost many workers their
jobs. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the planned
efficiency savings were 'code' for job losses.
Downing Street said departmental spending ministers had already identified
efficiency savings which would finance the bulk of the increases with
minimal job losses.
A senior official said opposition claims that the freeze on departmental
running costs would inevitably lead to job losses or cuts in services were
'arrant nonsense'.
'This decision has not been taken without the relevant ministers having an
extremely clear idea about where the savings are going to come from,' he
said.
However, the government's approach to public sector pay has clearly softened
since the Budget, when Mr Clarke insisted that efficiency savings should be
used to fund improved services as well as higher pay.
City analysts said it would be difficult to fund the rise in the pay bill
from productivity increases. Some suggested job cuts of 40,000 would be
needed to cover the review body rises. Union leaders were pleased that the
review bodies' recommendations had been broadly accepted. The bodies were
effectively suspended during the operation of the 1.5 per cent public sector
pay limit in 1993-94.
The unions were also pleased that pay rises will be close to those in the
private sector, where earnings are currently rising at about 3 per cent.
Mr Mick Graham, local government secretary of the GMB general union, said
that the 4m public sector workers not covered by review bodies would see 3
per cent as a 'benchmark'.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the award was 'probably the best obtainable in the current
climate'.
The settlement means that public sector pay as a whole will lag behind the
private sector for the second year running after outstripping it in the two
previous years.
The detailed findings of the public sector pay review bodies include a move
towards performance only pay rises for senior civil servants and a further
move to hasten the introduction of local bargaining in the National Health
Service.
Review awards may cost 40,000 jobs, Page 9

FT  04 FEB 94 / Major warns rebel ministers: Disunity could cost election,
MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night moved to shore up his premiership with a blunt and
unprecedented warning that disunity and faction-fighting among Conservative
MPs could cost the party the next general election.
At a hastily-called meeting of the 1922 committee attended by nearly 200 of
the party's backbench MPs, Mr Major said that errant or disloyal ministers
in future would be sacked from the government. He would put the country and
party ahead of personal friendships.
His comments won warm applause from those attending. But some suggested
later that unless the warning was followed by a much surer approach in
running the government, it would do little to restore the Conservatives'
popularity with the voters.
It came on the eve of a Daily Telegraph poll which showed the Tories' rating
up half a percentage point on last month at 26 per cent, still trailing
Labour at 45.5 per cent.
The speech, dubbed by MPs as the beginning of a 'No more Mr Nice Guy'
approach from Mr Major, marked his second move within two days to restore
his battered authority over the party.
Earlier this week he abruptly dismissed a delegation of rightwing Tory MPs
who had demanded a cabinet reshuffle to promote their supporters.
But with many backbench MPs openly speculating that Mr Major's own future
would depend on the outcome of the local and European elections in May and
June, he decided last night to go much further in attempting to shore up his
premiership.
In a 20-minute address during which he acknowledged that the party had been
riven by infighting between right and left and between pro- and
anti-Europeans, he said: 'The sniping has to stop, the feuding has to stop,
the squandering of energies on petty factionalism has to stop. We have to
unite and fight for what we believe in.'
Mr Major, who disclosed that he plans to tour the country with his message,
said that the infighting was drowning out the good news about economic
recovery. He added: 'I have to say that we cannot afford that.'
The economic recovery was strengthening, inflation would remain low,
unemployment would continue to fall and British exporters had unprecedented
opportunities. In those circumstances, he added: 'I am not prepared to stand
quietly by and see our party squander its power and lose its opportunity for
good.'
Referring to constant carping at his leadership, he went on: 'We need to
stop the huge weight of criticism we have faced that is based on unsourced,
anonymous comment . . . I do not flinch from criticism but I would rather
have it direct than anonymously, rather face to face than behind the hand.'
Mr Major then indicated that he would take a much tougher line with
ministers who embarrassed the government. He told the MPs that he would put
the interests of the country and the party ahead of any personal feelings
for colleagues.
Senior aides said that his remarks were directed at ministers whose personal
lives made them the subject of scandal and those in the government who were
disloyal to its decisions.
Mr Major rejected the arguments of those on the right of the party that the
Conservatives needed a period in opposition to rebuild their philosophy and
energy. He said: 'We don't know what it is like but I bet it's miserable and
frustrating.'

FT  04 FEB 94 / Mirror-backed group in Pounds 50m bid to control Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers is planning a pre-emptive
strike to try to win early control of the loss-making company that publishes
The Independent and The Independent on Sunday.
A formal offer is expected from the consortium today valuing the company at
more than Pounds 50m - an offer that is being pitched directly at the
institutional shareholders which hold 52 per cent of Newspaper Publishing,
the company that owns the two newspapers.
The offer, for more than Pounds 2.50 a share, will be in the form of a
mixture of MGN shares and cash. There will also be a full cash alternative.
By moving now, the consortium, which holds nearly 48 per cent of the
company, is by-passing Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing,
and his team of non-executive directors who are assessing the consortium bid
and a rival bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of
Ireland. The implication of the decision to go ahead without either
recommendation or endorsement from the board suggests that the MGN
consortium may have become exasperated by delays and the continuing talks
with the O'Reilly team.
Some of the consortium fear that the non-executive directors of Newspaper
Publishing favour the O'Reilly bid for up to 24.99 per cent of the company
plus a willingness to buy out up to 20 per cent of the existing shares held
by institutions.
The consortium brings together founders of The Independent, including Mr
Andreas Whittam Smith, the two main existing shareholders, the Spanish and
Italian newspaper groups, El Pais and La Repubblica, and Mirror Group
Newspapers, which plans to take a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing.
As part of the deal, MGN would take over the management of the broadsheet
newspaper publisher, apart from editorial, with an inevitable loss of jobs.
The deal, it is believed, will be underwritten by MGN, publishers of the
Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People.
It is clear that Mr Hay Davison has been trying to get an auction going and
has been asking both sides to improve their offer. The O'Reilly camp, for
instance, has been asked to extend its offer to include more than 20 per
cent of the institutional shares, perhaps also bringing in a partner.
The O'Reilly bid stands little chance of success unless it can gain the
support of at least some members of the consortium. Mr Giles Elliott of
Schroders, the merchant bank, acting for El Pais and La Repubblica, has made
it clear that his clients and the founders of The Independent will vote
against an O'Reilly deal.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Maxwell musical injunction could stop the show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the
curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the
life and times of the late Robert Maxwell.
Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late
publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the
High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production.
The musical tells the tycoon's life story through updated versions of
familiar tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan. Now in rehearsal, the show is due
to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11.
The attorney-general's move to close down a West End production before its
first night is regarded as without precedent.
However, it is no more unprecedented, most lawyers say, than the prospect of
the Maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past
a theatre advertising the story of their father as 'the musical review that
will make you laugh, sing - and be angry'.
The musical, which has cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, has been produced by Mr
Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies.
Mr Steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the
attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested.
However, he said he was leaving matters in the hands of his lawyers.
Press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep
concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyers .
Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, led calls for reporting
restrictions to be placed on a recent High Court ruling that Robert Maxwell
had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in Berlitz, the publishing
company.
Turning down his request, the judge asked him: 'Is it going to be your
client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation?'
At that point, lawyers in court themselves fell about laughing.

FT  04 FEB 94 / Shopping centres hived off to form Pounds 800m listed
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares are to be offered in a new property company which will own seven
shopping centres, including the Lakeside complex in Thurrock, the largest in
southern England.
Capital Shopping Centres will become one of the seven largest listed
property companies on the London Stock Exchange. It will have gross assets
of Pounds 800m, of which Lakeside will account for half.
CSC is being created by Transatlantic Holdings, the life assurance and
property group, which is controlled by Mr Donald Gordon, the South African
financier. He is best known for founding his country's largest insurance
group, Liberty Life, and buying into the UK's Sun Life and Sun Alliance.
Transatlantic, which is 54 per cent owned by Liberty Life and 19 per cent
owned by France's largest insurer UAP, will retain about 75 per cent of the
new company's shares (issued at net asset value). It will also keep its
non-retail properties, worth Pounds 600m, and its half share of Sun Life and
3 per cent stake in Sun Alliance.
The demerger will provide new funds for the retail operation. Transatlantic
hopes it will also lead to a more attractive valuation for the retail
properties.
Brokers expected significant interest in the issue. 'I think the market will
like the idea of having a large specialist retail property company,' said Mr
Chris Turner, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. According to the brokerage, the
property sector is currently trading at a 19 per cent premium to its asset
value, and it is expected that CSC will be priced above asset value.
Transatlantic will also raise an additional Pounds 200m from a convertible
bond issue. Mr Gordon, the chairman, said this was to pay off floating rate
debt and the Pounds 162m recently paid to increase the company's interest in
the Harlequin shopping centre in Watford.
Of the seven shopping centres to be owned by CSC, three have been built
since 1990. Mr Gordon argued that shopping centres needed five to seven
years to reach maturity. Set against a background of increasing consumer
confidence, he argued there was potential for a substantial increase in
rental income.
Excluding the Harlequin centre, CSC's rental income is estimated at Pounds
28.4m for 1993, and the Harlequin would be expected to contribute at least
Pounds 10m in 1994.
The flotation, planned for April, is to be co-sponsored by Morgan Stanley
and Jardine Fleming.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: News Corp preference
shareholders fear losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of exchangeable preference shares issued by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation fear they may incur a considerable financial loss due to a legal
wrangle over rights to new shares.
In 1989, News Corp raised the equivalent of Dollars 375m (using current
exchange rates) in sterling, guilders and D-Marks through the preference
shares, which were convertible into shares in Pearson, the media, banking
and industrial group. In the late 1980s, News Corp built a stake in Pearson
which reached a high point of 20.5 per cent. It has subsequently cut its
holding to 4.9 per cent.
Last year, Pearson de-merged Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer, and
Pearson shareholders were offered one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held
in the parent, which owns the Financial Times.
A notice published in the FT on December 13 advised holders of News Corp's
preference shares that they were entitled to the Royal Doulton shares as
part of the exchange property when they exercised their exchange right. As a
result, many holders decided to exchange and traders adjusted the price of
the preference shares to reflect the value of the Royal Doulton shares.
However, the market was thrown into confusion by a notice in Monday's FT
which said that News Corp was taking legal advice over whether the Royal
Doulton shares were part of the exchange property. News Corp has declined to
elaborate on the notice.
The notice has serious financial implications for both traders and investors
since many have made sales of Royal Doulton shares in anticipation of
receiving them as part of the exchange property. They also face foreign
exchange losses if they have to unwind their hedging positions.
Traders said that News Corp's efforts to improve its relationship with the
international investment community would be damaged if it kept the Royal
Doulton shares.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Davila admits 'error' in Chile's futures scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The man at the centre of the Chilean Codelco futures scandal, Mr Juan Pablo
Davila, has broken his silence, telling journalists he committed an error
but not a criminal offence.
Mr Davila, former chief futures operator of Codelco, Chile's state copper
company, is alleged to have lost the company Dollars 200m in a four-month
period from September 1993. 'I don't believe that I have committed any
crime,' said Mr Davila. 'I made a mistake and I will assume all
responsibility for that mistake.'
Mr Davila, who faces possible criminal charges, repeated his account that a
computer inputting error set in train the cycle of events that led to
unprecedented losses on the copper, gold and silver futures markets.
Codelco executives, until now insistent that Mr Davila acted alone and
without their knowledge, showed signs of breaking ranks.
Mr Fernando Molina, who represents President Patricio Aylwin on Codelco's
board, said: 'It is difficult to believe that one person could mount such an
enormous operation - for Dollars 180m and 1m tonnes of copper - without
anybody else finding out about it. He would have to be a genius.'
The 20,000-strong Federation of Copper Workers reiterated its attack on
Codelco's management, rejecting suggestions that it had sent its support to
Codelco president, Mr Alejandro Noemi.
However, the federation sharply criticised statements which had been made by
some politicians that the futures fiasco was further evidence of the need to
privatise the state corporation.

   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of the Dominican Republic's international bank debt will begin
signing a debt restructuring agreement on February 14 in Toronto which will
cut the country's bank debt in half. The pact, the first with the Dominican
Republic since 1986, will cover about Dollars 1.1bn of debt. The bank group,
chaired by Bank of Nova Scotia, includes Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical
Bank and Royal Bank of Canada.
The signature of all creditors is necessary before the agreement can be
considered by the country's Congress.
Thirty-five per cent of the debt will be submitted for cash - at 25 cents
for every dollar face value - and the rest exchanged for 30-year bonds at a
discount of 35 per cent to the debt's face value. The discount bonds, paying
interest at  13/16 of a point over Libor, will carry collateral guaranteeing
repayment of principal and 12 months of interest.

<TEXT>
Romania's ruling Party of Social Democracy said yesterday it had agreed on a
coalition with the hardline Romanian National Unity party to include other
extreme nationalist and former communist parties.
The left-wing PSDR, which formed a minority government after winning
elections in September 1992, said it hoped to conclude negotiations for the
new multi-party coalition by March 1.
Pro-reform opposition parties said the move would have a disastrous affect
on Romania's image abroad and that economic reform would remain at a
standstill.
The two parties said they aimed to include the Socialist Labour party, the
self-proclaimed heir to the Romanian Communist party, and the Greater
Romania party, an openly anti-Semitic group, in the new coalition in order
to reach a parliamentary majority after a close-run no-confidence vote in
December.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Chubais sounds inflation warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the only surviving radical reformer in the Russian
government, said yesterday that the first-quarter budget would show whether
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, really intended to change the
country's reform course.
Unless the government managed, by adopting a tough fiscal and monetary
policy, to reduce inflation to 5-6 per cent a month by the end of the year,
rather than the 15-18 per cent mentioned by Mr Chernomyrdin at the weekend,
economic reform in 1994 would have failed.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister, vowed yesterday to stick to a
tough fiscal and financial policy and to keep the budget deficit to 5-8 per
cent of gross domestic product. Like the inflation figure, this target was
agreed with the International Monetary Fund by the previous government.
Mr Chubais, who has stayed in office to complete his massive voucher
privatisation programme, also ridiculed a programme drawn up by veteran
pro-market economists proposing price and wage controls and abolition of the
voucher scheme. 'It's a long time since I've read academic work which is so
far removed from reality,' he said. The report, commissioned to help the
prime minister in his search for non-monetary methods to fight inflation,
has apparently displeased President Boris Yeltsin, who has remained silent
over Mr Chernomyrdin's policy 'corrections' but is expected to address
parliament on economic policy on February 18.
Meanwhile, Russian negotiators yesterday began a new round of talks with
Belarus on the proposed currency union which has been the other main source
of friction between conservatives and the radicals who have mostly left the
government. After an outcry from the radicals who said an original plan to
swap the Russian rouble for the Belarussian currency at one-for-one would
hurt Russian economic interests, the exchange rate in subsequent drafts was
adjusted to a more realistic rate of one-for-three.
Outstanding disagreements include Belarus' desire for subsidised energy from
Russia.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: IMI stock likely to open at 10%
premium
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian financial services group
privatised this week, look set to open at a premium of about 10 per cent,
based on early indications from dealers in London.
The shares in IMI, which closed its public tender offer ahead of schedule on
Tuesday night following massive oversubscription, were being quoted at
between L12,000 and L12,200, compared with an issue price of L10,900.
The deal has caused considerable satisfaction in the Italian Treasury, which
has sold about half its stake in the Rome-based financial services group.
However, the possibility of a sharp premium when official trading starts
next Wednesday may trigger criticism that IMI was sold too cheaply.
Unofficial estimates suggest demand from institutions outside Italy for the
65m shares on offer exceeded supply by up to nine times. Details of demand
for the US tranche of 35m shares have not been released.
Retail investors in Italy are believed to have made about 370,000
applications to buy stock in the two days before the issue was closed. The
level of demand suggests applications will be scaled back to the minimum 250
share level and may even mean some investors will go empty handed.
It seems certain that the Treasury will sell the additional 19m shares held
back for market stabilisation purposes, taking the overall proceeds from the
issue to almost L2,400bn.

The European Commission yesterday said it was reviewing a planned

The joint venture, which initially plans to offer fixed-wire services to

The Commission has about a month to approve it or open an in-depth inquiry

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings was pulled back
sharply in early trading as word swept the market that US investment bank
Goldman Sachs had turned bearish on the stock.
Goldman has been a leading supporter of the shares and any change of stance
would have been a serious blow to sentiment. But analyst Mr Eric Philo said
he had merely taken the stock off Goldman's 'priority list', which contains
its 30 most highly recommended companies in the UK and mainland Europe.
He said he remained a buyer and predicted a share price in the UK of around
2150p within the next 12 months. The shares tumbled nearly 50p initially but
clawed their way back to close only 8 lower on the day at 1967p after
unusually heavy turnover of 3.1m.
Speculation of an imminent share split at Thorn EMI was heard as the stock
gathered steam to hit a record 1128p, a rise of 28. There were also renewed
bid rumours as analysts pondered the fallout from the Dollars 10bn takeover
battle for Paramount Communications in the US between Viacom and QVC
Network.
While the battle has reignited the debate over the market value of groups
falling in the multi-media fold, such as Thorn, it has also raised the
suggestion that the losing bidder may turn its attention to the UK group.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries shed 8 to 521p as
securities house UBS cut its forecasts and lowered its stance. The house
turned seller and reduced its 1994 profits estimate by Pounds 130m to Pounds
1.83bn on concern over the growth potential for BAT's US insurance arm,
Farmers. Analyst Mr Chris Hitchings added that he 'retained a cautious view
of the US tobacco side'.
Hong Kong related banks HSBC and Standard Chartered continued to power ahead
on the back of a strong Hong Kong market, and anticipation of encouraging
interim figures from the banking sector. Buyers of HSBC were further
encouraged by a recommendation from Peregrine, the leading Hong Kong
stockbroker, which put a target price of Dollars 150 on the bank's shares,
equivalent to a further 200p on the UK price. HSBC rose 26 to 1040p while
Standard Chartered gained 48 at 1410p.
The support services sector was enlivened by the issue of a call warrant by
SG Warburg on five of the stocks in the sector. Each of the 20m warrants is
issued at 135p, with a basket of 10 priced at 1350p. The warrants expire in
August 1995 and the exercise price is Pounds 107.50p. Three of the stocks
performed strongly, with Hays jumping 10 1/2 to 331 1/2 p, while Rentokil
added 11 at 279p and Chubb finished 15 ahead at 421p. BET crept 3 ahead to
154 1/2 p, while Christian Salvesen, which issued a profits warning on
Monday, bounced 4 1/2 to 312p.
Lasmo rose 5 to 133p on news that the company had appointed a new finance
director, The shares were also helped by news of an oil discovery in
Algeria, and a rise in the price of Brent crude.
Biotechnology research group Celltech improved 9 to 228p on news of a
breakthrough against rheumatoid arthritis. The company is developing a
product which competes with the US treatment highlighted yesterday. However,
UBS remains a seller, arguing that significant gains are unlikely before the
turn of the century.
Chemicals group Courtaulds rose 13 to 538p with the help of a buy note from
Shaw, the medium-sized agency broker.
Speculation that international investor Mr George Soros might be poised to
invest in Medeva raised some eyebrows but the shares, which plunged from a
high of 220p in the summer, gained 8 at 180p.
Further losses at Euro Disney were no worse than the market feared and the
shares put on 5 at 410p.
Cadbury Schweppes was one of the few shades of red among food manufacturers
as investors and dealers continued to fret over the possibility of the
company making a rights issue with its results next month.
Among stores, GUS had another strong session, adding 16 at 640p as
speculation over the possibility of the group's property arm being floated
continued. The company, which has denied the story, said the full-year
rental income for the division was in excess of Pounds 50m.
Wire and engineering group Bridon recovered from a sharp decline early in
the session to close 4 up at 160p. The shares initially fell 25 to 131p
after the group issued a profits warning and said it would be making
exceptional provisions of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m to cover
restructuring.
The market continued to appreciate this week's sale of Rover by British
Aerospace to BMW and BAe rose 28 further to 573p. Component suppliers were
also boosted by the same deal and BBA moved 9 1/2 ahead to 223p, while GKN
put on 10 at 614p. Lucas Industries closed 9 up at 232p.
Consumer leisure products and packaging firm Porter Chadburn shed a penny to
21p after a profits warning.
Lonrho rose 8 1/2 to 169 1/2 p as investors anticipated a successful
flotation for Ashanti Goldfields, of Ghana, in which it has a 45 per cent
stake.

FT  03 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities surge on buy order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity and water shares surged ahead yesterday on reports of a big buy
order from one of the UK's leading investment institutions and optimism over
interest rate cuts.
While the initial spurt came from hopes of an interest rate reduction in the
near term, support was fuelled by talk that Kleinwort Benson Investment
Management was a large buyer of the sector on the back of receipts - said to
be in the region of Pounds 200m - from its European privatisation trust
fund. Dealers said they believed Kleinwort was buying UK utilities as a
holding investment ahead of the upcoming privatisation issues.
Sentiment was also boosted by the second share buy-back in as many months by
Eastern Electricity. The Rec bought a further 500,000 shares at 699p after
the market closed on Tuesday, adding to the 1.2m bought at 644p two weeks
ago. Eastern has shareholders approval to buy back a further 11.8m shares.
Yesterday the stock surged 21 to a record 722p. Elsewhere, Norweb hit a
record, 800p, up 24, and Northern reached an all-time high of 781p, a jump
of 22. Among the waters, Anglian gained 11 to 579p, Yorkshire 12 to 606p and
Severn 13 to 632p.

FT  03 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Derivatives lift FT-SE indices to new
peaks - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the UK market's leading stock indices powered ahead to record highs
yesterday as a sudden burst of big buying interest in the FT-SE 100 March
future, plus a persistent story that a cut in UK interest rates may be
imminent, caught marketmakers short of stock.
The suddenness and weight of buying interest in the Footsie future caught
dealers on the hop and transformed the market, with the leaders, Mid 250
stocks and the smaller companies' shares all rallying strongly from an
initial bout of weakness and gathering pace throughout a dramatic session.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended a net 38.8 up at an historic closing high of
3,520.3, having peaked at 3,520.4 only minutes before the close of trading.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has regularly outperformed its senior index,
finished 45.5 up at a peak 4,150.9.
Dealers lowered share prices at the outset of trading, with the FT-SE 100
around 10 points easier following the modest falls on Wall Street and Tokyo
overnight. The market was widely regarded by dealers as being overblown and
most marketmakers were said to have been short of stock overnight. Little in
the way of selling pressure was noted for much of the morning, but dealers
remained happy to absorb any stock that came on offer. The FT-SE 100 at the
day's low was down 13.7 at 3,467.8.
The sudden appearance of a buyer of around 2,000 FT-SE 100 contracts, said
to have been Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was the catalyst for a
searing upsurge in the futures and the cash market. By the time Goldman's
business was completed, the future had risen some 20 points, driving the
cash market sharply better. The purchase of 2,000 FT-SE 100 contracts was
estimated to have pumped some Pounds 175m into the market.
The cash market's response was immediate. The 100 index accelerated all day
and peaked just two minutes before the close. Second line stocks were also
chased sharply higher, with dealers aware that tomorrow sees the start of
trading in FT-SE Mid 250 derivatives, both futures and options, on the OMLX
Exchange in London. The Liffe market's Mid 250 Index futures contract is
being launched on February 25.
The head of trading at one of the leading UK integrated houses said: 'There
was no obvious catalyst for the market; no lead from gilts or economic data.
It was purely futures-led and hit a market expected to go lower.' He added
that institutions still underweight in equities had tried to buy the cash
market but were unable to do so at realistic prices. Consequently they were
pressured into buying the future, which in turn dragged up the cash market.
'We are climbing a wall of fear,' commented one marketmaker.
The rate cut story impacted strongly on utilities, and particularly on the
electricity stocks, which offer above average yields.
Turnover in equities reached 1.0846bn shares, with non-Footsie stocks
accounting for 68 per cent of the total. The value of customer business
transacted on Tuesday was Pounds 2.165bn. Bank shares saw the two Far
Eastern-influenced stocks, Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings, stage
another big leap forward, the latter boosted by the covered warrant issued
by BZW and the former reflecting talk of imminent and substantial upgrades.
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, was said to have upgraded Abbey
National, National Westminster Bank and Barclays.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Strong buying from a leading US investment house, together with renewed
hopes of a reduction in interest rates, brought a squeeze in Footsie
futures, sending the near month contract breaking through the 3,500
resistance level to finish at an all-time high, writes Joel Kibazo.
A faltering start for the March contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,476 hinted at
a quiet session ahead. However, demand by independent traders and the return
of optimism on interest rates ahead of today's Bundesbank Council meeting,
brought a turnround in the fortunes of the contract.
The buying of 2,000 lots, reported to have been done by Goldman Sachs, added
impetus to the rise, pulling the cash market higher.
March maintained a strong premium for most of the session, but dealers said
that with a shortage of stock in the equities there were few arbitrage
opportunities.
The March contract ended at a record 3,530, up 49 from its previous close
and 13 points above its estimated fair value to cash which now stands at
nil. Volume was heavy, reaching 22,214 lots by the official close.
Traded options also saw hefty turnover, with 54,902 contracts dealt by the
close, of which 18,176 were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 8,465 in the
Euro FT-SE option.
Glaxo was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,996 lots transacted and
was followed by Argyll group at 3,163 contracts.
A report from the Liffe showed turnover in futures and options in January
1994 having increased by 93 per cent from a year ago.

FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rising bonds spark late
equity rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks staged a late rally yesterday as a round of profit-taking petered
out amid rising bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 11.53 ahead at 3,975.54, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 2.38 to 482.00, an all-time high. The American
SE composite added 1.90 at 487.89, its third straight record. The Nasdaq
composite gained 2.30 at 799.57. NYSE volume was 329m shares.
The day's economic reports elicited little reaction. The December index of
leading indicators and sales of existing homes were both strong, but the
market shrugged the reports off as old news.
With the US Treasury market unmoved by the release of the December data,
stocks were left with little direction. As a result, the Dow barometer
slipped into negative territory. But with bond prices showing steady
improvement in the afternoon, the blue chip index climbed back.
Oil shares were among the best performers. Texaco rose Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 67 3/4 , Exxon Dollars 1 to Dollars 67 1/4 and Mobil Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 81 1/8 .
Cyclical issues were mixed, with Caterpillar down Dollars 1 to Dollars 104
5/8 and Cummins Engine off Dollars 1 at Dollars 53 3/4 , but Union Carbide
Dollars 1 3/8 ahead at Dollars 26 and General Electric up Dollars 2 1/8 at
Dollars 109.
The blue chip Dow index was held back from a run into record territory by
Sears Roebuck. The retailer fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 when
Prudential Securities cut its rating on the stock.
The struggle to take over Paramount Communications provided a focal point
for the morning's activity, after Viacom and QVC both sweetened their bids
for the company moments before Tuesday's deadline.
With the winner still uncertain, Viacom's 'B' shares slipped Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 33 1/2 . QVC gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 46 3/4 as investors bet
that the cable network would lose the battle. The target company fell
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 after warning that it expected to post a net
loss of 29 to 33 cents a share in the three months to end-January.
Sprint, the long-distance telephone concern, advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 37 1/8 on its announcement of record revenues and income in the
fourth quarter.
On the Nasdaq, Amgen retreated Dollars 3 to Dollars 44 on a downgrading by
SG Warburg. Concern over the sales of its Neupogen treatment has depressed
the stock of late.
Canada
Toronto ended a five-day winning streak, slipping back in extremely heavy
trading. The TSE 300 index ended 17.8 off at 4,573.4, while falls led rises
by 439 to 393 after volume of 96m shares valued at CDollars 1.279bn. Golds
and banking shed 1.83 and 1.30 per cent respectively.
The communications and media sub-group rose 2.06 per cent. The increase
followed Maclean Hunter's announcement of a proposed takeover bid for it by
Rogers Communications. Maclean jumped CDollars 1 5/8 to CDollars 15 3/8 and
Rogers 'B' dipped CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 21 3/8.

FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower as
Kuala Lumpur surges 3.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices eased after an 8.8 per cent gain over the previous two days,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 166.31 off at 20,250.03 after a day's low of
20,099.41 and a peak of 20,399.24. The Topix index of all first section
stocks relinquished 15.44 to 1,627.66.
Investors adjusted their positions ahead of the government's economic
stimulus package due to be announced today. The Nikkei rose in the afternoon
on arbitrage linked buying, but large-lot profit-taking by corporate and
financial institutions ahead of the March book closing eroded the gains, as
well as selling by dealers and short term traders.
The rise in the yen against the dollar also hurt export oriented
high-technology stocks. A surge of buying by foreign investors had pushed up
the yen over a period of days, and fears of increased US pressure over
bilateral trade talks also triggered buying by currency traders. However,
later in London, Japanese stocks rallied on a recovery in the dollar and the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 18.97 at 1,356.34.
Volume totalled 670m shares, against 950m. Declines outpaced advances by 664
to 391, with 140 issues unchanged.
Foreign investors were buyers in a busy automotive sector. Fuji Heavy
Industries, the most active stock of the day, moved ahead Y14 to Y393 and
Nissan Motor advanced Y21 to Y841. Suzuki Motor, however, retreated Y110 to
Y1,340 on profit-taking; and Honda, which owns 20 per cent of Rover, fell
Y80 to Y1,620, with investors discouraged by BMW's acquisition of the UK
carmaker.
The rise in the yen depressed Matsushita Electric Industrial by Y40 to
Y1,690 and Sony Y230 to Y6,170. Canon, the precision maker, slipped Y40 to
Y1,580 and Citizen Watch declined Y15 to Y730.
Banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y30
to Y3,310 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank eased Y20 to Y1,990.
Higher gold prices supported Sumitomo Metal Mining, which added Y11 at Y911.
Speculative issues were also bought, Sanrio climbing Y160 to Y1,770 and
Hanwa, the steel trader, jumping Y62 to Y715.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 163.71 to 21,957.94 in volume of 96.7m
shares. Turnover rose on active trading by investors realising profits on
long term holdings in bank shares.
Roundup
Some sharply higher market indices were seen around the Pacific Rim.
KUALA LUMPUR reflected strong institutional buying of blue chip stocks as
the composite index forged ahead 41.05, or 3.7 per cent, to 1,148.04.
Ekran, which has been awarded the huge Bakun hydro-electric power project,
surged MDollars 8.40, or 44 per cent, to MDollars 27.50.
SEOUL climbed to a 52-month high, helped by massive liquidity on the back of
increasing customer deposits and in spite of Won170bn of sales by the
stabilisation fund. The composite stock index advanced 14.16, or 1.5 per
cent, to 974.26.
Customer deposits at brokerage houses were estimated to have hit a record
Won4,200bn on Tuesday. Fears of moves by the government to cool the market
brought profit-taking in some blue chips, but the sales were immediately
digested by aggressive buyers.
AUSTRALIA saw strong overseas buying, particularly from Asia, push the
market to another record close after overcoming some early weakness. The All
Ordinaries index ended 2.0 higher at 2,312.1, having slipped to 2,285.0 in
early trade.
BOMBAY rose 2.3 per cent, as domestic mutual funds returned as heavy
speculative buyers after nearly a week's absence. The BSE 30-share index
finished 88.78 up at 4,036.64, having opened lower on mild selling prompted
by a government move on Tuesday to raise petrol and diesel prices.
TAIWAN was helped ahead by a strong gain in Formosa group shares, which were
supported by unconfirmed local newspaper reports that the group would expand
the size of its planned petrochemical complex. Formosa climbed TDollars 2.50
to TDollars 56.50.
The weighted index was finally 82.30, or 1.3 per cent, ahead at 6,259.21 in
heavy turnover of TDollars 96.6bn, against Tuesday's TDollars 101bn.
MANILA moved forward in a technical rally, in spite of worries sparked by
Tuesday's bombings at three oil companies. The Manila index strengthened
70.65, or 2.5 per cent, to close at 2,906.14.
HONG KONG saw a flurry of late selling linked to the futures market which
erased early gains and dragged stocks slightly lower.
The Hang Seng index finished a net 41.06 down at 11,785.83, having hit an
early high of 11,970.
NEW ZEALAND paused after six consecutive days of gains and the NZSE-40
capital index fell 4.94 to 2,418.68.
SINGAPORE was mixed in spite of a buoyant Malaysian market, and the Straits
Times Industrial index shed 11.0 to 2,338.08.
BANGKOK picked up from a sharp early fall which saw the SET index almost 30
points lower and ended just 2.14 off at 1,453.44 amid renewed demand for
finance stocks.
KARACHI finished lower after adverse political news, little institutional
support and only cautious buying by foreign funds. The KSE 100-share index
fell 19.37 to 2,254.44.

FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: The dark side of emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first month of the new year has seen the flip side to investment in the
world's emerging markets, a salutary reminder that these markets remain
extremely volatile.
Turkey dived nearly 35 per cent in dollar terms over the week after the
currency crisis that saw the lira devalued by 12 per cent, and ultimately
led to the resignation of the central bank governor.
Poland's bubble was pricked - it remains to be seen over the next few
trading sessions whether or not it has finally burst - although this has yet
to show up in the IFC data printed on this page.
In Latin America, Brazil lost 10 per cent in dollar terms: however, the
story here remains uncertain until a decision one way or the other on the
fiscal package.
Pakistan took a knock, but commentators say this was due mainly to
profit-taking, particularly in the cement, chemical and pharmaceutical
sectors. It is worth noting that India benefited from Pakistan's loss, as
foreign investors switched portfolios.
The performance of these markets in recent days tends to support the view
that they have seen a much needed correction in overbought conditions, as
opposed - with the exception, perhaps, of Poland - to a freefall.
Turkey remains unsettled, down 7 per cent yesterday, although foreign
investors have come in as bargain hunters; the market's fall was provoked by
domestic selling.
Brazil, meanwhile, has soared by almost 20 per cent in local currency terms
this week. Investors could be in for another rollercoaster ride.

FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris builds confidence on
interest rate scenario
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a Bundesbank rate reduction today cut more ice in France than they
did in Germany, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS liked the scenario so much that it pushed the CAC-40 index forward by
1 per cent, or 24.64 to 2,355.93. Turnover was estimated at a high FFr6bn.
Euro Disney went against the rising trend, off FFr1.55 at FFr36.20, as
investors reacted to a widening of its net loss in the three months of
December. The market was also awaiting the outcome of a meeting by banks
exposed to the group's debt on an independent report prepared by auditors.
There was good news elsewhere. Peugeot, encouraged by a rise in January car
sales, added FFr6 to FFr867 and Carrefour advanced FFr36 to FFr4,361 as it
reported a 5 per cent improvement in 1993 turnover, although this was much
in line with expectations.
Paribas, which is expected to release 1993 results today, gained FFr26 to
FFr589, while there were reports that it might be about to announce a
rearrangement in its cross shareholding with Navigation Mixte, the
investment concern, with some sources suggesting that it might lower its 29
per cent stake.
AMSTERDAM saw strength in most of its main blue chips, and this took the AEX
up 1.64 to 437.38.
Akzo rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 210.60, up11 per cent on the year so far. The
chemical group has benefited from its merger with Nobel, announced last
November; but Flemings, in London maintained that there are more attractive
recovery plays in the chemical sector, while Akzo's estimated net gearing of
67 per cent in 1994 and 60 per cent in 1995 'will restrain capital spending
and any dividend increases for at least two years'.
Fokker stayed busy as the aircraft manufacturer confirmed reports that it
had, in the past, been paying Deutsche Aerospace high prices for air frames,
but noted that the situation had since improved. The shares shed a further
Fl 1.10 to Fl 21.80, off 8 per cent on the week so far and 12.8 per cent
since the year's high on January 26.
ZURICH resumed its advance after Tuesday's pause as strong demand took
banking stocks to highs for the year and helped the SMI index 20.4 ahead to
3,169.1.
UBS, the first of the leading banks to report 1993 results later this month,
added SFr24 to SFr1,510 and SBC was SFr10 higher at SFr529.
A SFr10 rise in Alusuisse to SFr640 was attributed to its recent moderate
valuation and this week's rise among US aluminium suppliers following the
agreement to cut global production.
FRANKFURT was a market of individual stocks, the rise of just 4.34 to
2,184.01 in the Dax index masking some big changes at corporate level.
Volkswagen liked the court ruling against the Adam Opel claim that VW had
poached GM staff, rising DM3.30 to DM447.80. Mannesmann, the engineering
group with telecom prospects, seemed even more pleased that DB Capital
Markets (Deutschland) was issuing 1m American-style call warrants on the
stock, andclosed DM10 higher at DM421.
Turnover eased from DM10.5bn to DM9.4bn. Among smaller companies the
software publisher, SAP, soared DM495, or 25 per cent to DM2,450 on a 15 per
cent rise in net earnings.
MILAN's Comit index rose 2.55 to a fifth consecutive high of 668.30.
Montedison returned to the spotlight, adding L82 or 7.1 per cent to L1,243
as more analysts in the US and UK came to the view that the group was likely
to return to profitability this year - rather earlier than many had
originally thought. S G Warburg, which rates the stock as a buy, is holding
presentations for analysts in Edinburgh and London today and tomorrow.
Fiat rose L145 or 3 per cent to L5,011, shrugging off a protest against
layoffs by tens of thousands of workers who packed the central square in
Turin. Olivetti added L57 or 2.3 per cent to L2,489 in response to comments
on Tuesday by Mr Carlo De Benedetti that he still hoped the computer group
would break even this year.
Shares in the newly privatised IMI, which begin trading next week in Milan,
were quoted around L12,200 on the grey market in London, compared with the
L10,900 offer price.
MADRID gave domestic investment funds the credit for a sharp recovery after
Tuesday's correction, the general index rising 5.10, or 1.5 per cent to
356.47 with turnover staying high at Pta48.4bn.
Construction stocks rose 3.3 per cent as utilities took a relative breather;
in banks, Banesto rose Pta15 to Pta870 after a high of Pta898.
STOCKHOLM rose on better than expected results from Electrolux and news that
Renault had sold part of its stake in Volvo. The Affarsvarlden index added
14.6 to 1602.8 in record turnover of SKr6.1bn. Electrolux B rose SKr26 or
7.3 per cent to SKr381 and Volvo B by SKr16 to SKr692.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Sterling trades lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours about the Bank of England trying to cap the rise of sterling caused
the UK currency to weaken yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
The release of better than expected January UK official reserves appeared to
be the cause for the pound falling below DM2.59 and Dollars 1.50 in early
European trading. The currency regained some of its loss against the D-Mark,
but stayed weaker against the dollar in London trading.
There was little activity in the European Monetary System grid ahead of
today's meeting of the Bundesbank council, which will consider whether to
ease German monetary policy.
With no statement forthcoming about the monthly monetary policy meeting
between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England, markets yesterday turned to UK reserves figures for
direction. News of the figures, which were higher than forecast, pushed the
pound below a key technical support level of DM2.5950, prompting further
selling.
One explanation for why the level of reserves caused sterling weakness was
that traders saw it as evidence that the Bank of England had tried to cap
sterling's appreciation. Analysts reasoned that the rise in the reserves,
which are dollar denominated, showed that sterling had been sold.
Mr Peter Luxton of Barclays commented: 'Although the bank says it has no
formal targets for sterling, the figures do lend credence to the view that
it is not happy with sterling going above DM2.60.'
Others are sceptical about this explanation. Mr Gerry Holtham, chief
economist at Lehman Brothers, noted: 'It may be a plausible account of why
sterling weakened, but it is not a credible explanation about how the Bank
behaves. I do not think the Bank believes it can influence the level of
sterling for long. Also, if it wanted to talk sterling down, then you would
not have Eddie George (governor of the Bank of England) going out and
talking as he has been doing.'
This is a reference to a speech made by Mr George on Tuesday evening, in
which he said prospects for sustained output growth and gradually falling
unemployment were 'better than at any time' in his 31-year professional
career. Lunch-time rumours in the stock market of a possible base rate cut
put further downward pressure on the pound.
Few currency analysts, however, were expecting a UK rate cut to emerge from
yesterday's meeting. It was noted that if Mr Clarke wishes to maintain his
credibility, he needs more compelling evidence of an economic slowdown than
is currently available, if he wants to justify easing rates.
Mr Clarke's positive comments in recent weeks about the strength of the
economic recovery have given no evidence that he wishes to reduce rates.
Sterling finished weaker against all the main currencies. It lost a pfennig
to close in London at DM2.5928 and was more than a cent down against the
dollar at Dollars 1.495.
In the absence of fresh data ahead of today's Bundesbank Council meeting,
the D-Mark traded in a fairly narrow range. Opinion was evenly divided as to
whether or not the central bank would relax policy. In a Reuters poll of 20
London and European-based analysts, 10 said they expected the German central
bank to cut, while 10 saw no easing.
Of those expecting a rate cut, seven forecast a 50 basis points reduction in
both the Lombard and discount rates which, respectively, provide a ceiling
and a floor between which the Bundesbank offers liquidity to the market.
Mr Holtham said it would be unusual for the central bank to lower rates in
the middle of annual wage talks. The Bundesbank has always taken pay
negotiations as a key indicator of inflationary pressures. Although these
are going well overall, the central bank is expected to wait for some higher
profile unions, such as IG Metall and IG Bau, to settle before making its
move.
He went on to say that he did not believe German money supply figures, or
perceived D-Mark weakness, were obstacles to easing policy. He noted that
the dollar had fallen back from recent highs of DM1.76-77 and that there was
insufficient momentum behind the currency to bother the Bundesbank. The
dollar closed in New York last night at DM1.7333.
After recent rises against the dollar, the yen weakened slightly yesterday
to finish in London at Y108.050, from Y107.640 on Tuesday. It also ended in
New York at Y108.05.
Some evidence of the shape of the fiscal stimulus planned by the Japanese
government emerged late yesterday. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister,
announced that the government proposed to implement income tax cuts
totalling Y5.3trillion (million million), effective from the beginning of
1994. 'In the next three years we will see a tax revenue shortfall of
Y18trn. This will increase household incomes and stimulate the economy,'
said Mr Hosokawa.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 750m of late,
unspecified assistance. Earlier in the day it put Pounds 219m of assistance
into the market at the established rate of 5 3/8 per cent.
A Pounds 300m upward revision in the expected shortage, from Pounds 900m to
Pounds 1.2bn, in the early afternoon caused overnight lending rates to rise
quite sharply. They climbed from the 5 1/2 - 3/4 per cent level seen in the
morning to a high of 8 1/2 per cent at about 2.30pm.

FT  03 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee traders nervous - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures closed little changed at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday, the market remaining nervous of news that Brazil had switched
responsibility for financing coffee retention to the private sector, though
some traders said this should raise prices. The May delivery position ended
at Dollars 1,161 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day.
At the London bullion market SILVER's bull run continued, the cash price
ending another 9 cents higher at Dollars 5.30 1/2 a troy ounce. PLATINUM
also added to this week's advance but GOLD was left behind, closing 15 cents
down at Dollars 384.60 an ounce.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador banana exports ride out
storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Following months of protests by Latin American banana producers and an
official condemnation by the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade of the
European Union's import restrictions on Latin American bananas, Ecuador has
announced near record export sales for 1993.
In spite of what Mr Henrique Betancourt, president of the Association of
Banana Producing Countries, has called the 'the worst crisis in the history
of banana production' Ecuador's total sales last year reached 2.618m tonnes,
73,000 tonnes more than in 1992 and the second highest level ever.
That performance came as a surprise as Ecuador, the world's largest banana
exporter, had faced not only a sales crisis because of the EC restrictions
but also a continued battle against disease.
Ecuador's success was not shared by other Latin American banana producers
and it was helped by being able to pick up the export slack left by Central
American production losses caused by last year's hurricanes and floods.
Mr Mariano Gonzalez, the agricultural minister, attributed the record
exports to the successful trade policies of President Duran Ballen's
administration, which wasted no time in gaining access to alternative

<TEXT>
German farmers called for urgent support after a Bonn ministry report
detailed income losses in the former West Germany of more than 6 per cent in
1992-93, reports Reuter from Hamburg.
The ministry said a further decline in 1993-94 could reach between 10 and 15
per cent.
A statement from the DBV farmers' union said its members were not
participating in the country's general pay advances. Their average incomes
were lagging those in comparable sectors by 35 per cent, and much of their
earnings would have to be reinvested to secure the survival of farms.
The union called for the reversal of farm budget cuts in Bonn and the
federal states and for a nationwide compensation scheme for currency losses
totalling Dm520m (Pounds 20m).
The union demanded that existing trade opportunities under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be fully explored and trade
distortions disadvantaging German farmers eliminated.
DBV representatives are to meet Mr Jochen Borchert, the farm minister, on
February 8.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US bulls drive aluminium and
copper still higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money from US investment funds continued to flood into the metals markets
yesterday, helping to boost prices on the London Metal Exchange and taking
aluminium to its highest level in 16 months. Copper also benefitted from the
buying spree, and rose to a five-month peak.
US funds have more than Dollars 25bn under management and most of their
investment is technically-based, pointed out Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the
Merrill Lynch financial services group. Consequently, when the aluminium
price broke through Dollars 1,270 a tonne yesterday, more buying by the
chart-watching funds was triggered.
Aluminium stocks are at record levels and will take about a year to be
whittled away even if the output cuts in prospect following the weekend deal
reached by some of the big aluminium-producing countries take place. Yet the
price for three-month metal continued to ignore the negative factors and
last night closed on the LME at Dollars 1,276.50, up another Dollars 15 a
tonne.
Mr Arnold said he did not share the euphoria that had enveloped the
aluminium market after the deal, because there was too much scope for
cheating and for the deal to unravel, but he could see aluminium's price
rising to between Dollars 1,300 and Dollars 1,400 a tonne.
As copper for delivery in three months rose Dollars 46.50 to Dollars 1,935 a
tonne on the LME Mr Arnold said: 'The funds certainly did some copper buying
today'. He suggested that eventually, when the market's fundamental weakness
asserted itself, copper's price would dip to 80 cents a pound (Dollars 1,763
a tonne) before an improving world economic performance took it back to 95
cents (Dollars 2,094 a tonne) at the year-end.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US cold weather boosts oil
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices firmed yesterday amid forecasts of continuing cold weather in the
north-east US.
The price of the benchmark Brent blend was Dollars 14.75 a barrel in late
London trading yesterday, 40 cents up on Tuesday's close of Dollars 14.35.
The cold weather in the north-east US has put considerable strain on
supplies of heating oil. European heating oil prices have also risen as
arbitrage opportunities to supply the US market have appeared.
The strong US demand has helped to underpin crude oil prices, which have
been lingering around the Dollars 14 level for several weeks.
But traders in London said it was too early to say whether the this week's
price rises, based on technical factors and the weather, could be sustained.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has based its hopes for an
early boost in crude oil prices on increased winter demand in the US, Europe
and Japan eroding stockpiles.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western zinc mine output falls
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zinc mining ended in Austria and Italy last year, brought to a halt by low
prices caused partly by a surge in imports of refined zinc from China and
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
This followed the closure of the last zinc mine in Germany in 1992 and
contributed to a 130,000-tonne, or 17 per cent, drop in production from
European zinc mines last year to 659,000 tonnes. Output in Spain also fell
steeply, by 22 per cent, because of the closure of one mine and drought
problems at another.
According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, 34 zinc mines
closed during 1993, reducing western world nominal capacity by 694,000
tonnes. Bolivia was hit by the closure of four mines and its output dropped
by 23 per cent.
The study group estimates that total western world zinc mine production fell
by 9.4 per cent to 5.125m tonnes last year. Meanwhile, producers maintained
zinc metal production at about the same level as in the previous year:
5.456m tonnes. Producers preferred to maintain high utilisation rates at
their plants in order to minimise costs, says the group, 'helped, at least
in the early part of the year, by the ready availability of concentrate (an
intermediate material) at attractive treatment terms'.
The good news for producers is that demand for zinc last year is estimated
by the group to have surpassed the record set in 1991 and moved up 2 per
cent from the 1992 level to 5.46m tonnes.
However, imports from Russia, Kazakhstan and China are believed to have
jumped from 308,000 to 415,000 tonnes to contribute to a supply surplus of
430,000 tonnes. The cumulative surplus in the past four years is more than
1m tonnes and stocks at the end of 1993 totalled 1.45m tonnes, 13.8 weeks of
consumption.
Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange, reflecting the growing stockpile,
averaged Dollars 961 a tonne, 23 per cent lower than in 1992 and 44 per cent
below the average in 1989 when prices peaked.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Egypt expects to double cotton
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt's state-owned Cotton Holding Company is expecting exports to double
this year - following price cuts and some liberalisation moves in the sector
designed to reverse years of falling sales.
Export commitments have already reached 80,600 bales for 1994, compared with
total shipments of 54,500 bales last year, according to Mr Samir Anis, the
holding company's commercial director. He said Egypt expected to win export
commitments for more than 100,000 bales by August, the end of the country's
cotton marketing year and start of its harvest.
Mr Anis said export commitments had risen across the board in Egypt's 20 or
so main export markets following the government's decision last autumn to
cut export prices sharply. Prices of extra-long stable grades of cotton were
cut by 15-20 per cent in September in a bid to recapture market share in the
face of years of strong competition, particularly from US brands.
Cotton is among Egypt's most important agricultural exports but the days
when the country was able to dominate world prices for some grades are long
past.
Output, yields and exports have fallen considerably since the early 1970s,
largely as a result of low official procurement prices paid to farmers.
Total export revenues from cotton fell to Dollars 43m in 1992-93 from
Dollars 52m in 1991-92, according to US embassy figures. Cotton is Egypt's
sixth biggest foreign exchange earner, after remittances, tourism, oil, Suez
Canal receipts and rice sales.
But exports, which stood at 685,000 bales in the 1981-82 season had dwindled
to a low of 48,000 bales by 1990-91 - a disastrous plunge, which the
government has in the past two years sought to reverse. A raft of
liberalising measures is planned to arrest the decline, and some have been
implemented.
Improved pesticide use and other agronomic improvements helped to improve
yields by more than a third in 1992 despite a continued fall in the total
acreage under cotton across Egypt; and the cotton production area in 1993
was 40 per cent of the total under cultivation in 1961.
Total cotton output this year is expected to reach a level similar to last
season's, about 1.08m bales.
Further liberalising moves are planned. The country's parliament is
considering a draft law to free prices, increase competition from the
private sector in what remains a strongly government-controlled sector and
to re-establish Alexandria's cotton exchange.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: No bids for Peruvian refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a surprise development, there were no bids at yesterday's auction of the
state-owned copper refinery in Peru's southern port of Ilo.
The US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation, producer of two-thirds of all
Peru's copper, had been widely tipped to become the new proprietor.
The base price had been set at USDollars 75m, with an additional Dollars 20m
to be invested over the next three years. 'Obviously, considerable interest
has been shown in the refinery by potential bidders,' said Mr Raul Otero,
president of the privatisation committee. 'It can therefore only be assumed
that the base price was fixed too high.'
There might be a second auction attempt at a lower base price, Mr Otero
said. Alternatively Mineroperu might continue to operate the refinery.
SPCC had been considered the 'natural buyer' for Ilo, but Japan's Mitsui
(which was associated in the refinery's planning and construction between
1973 and 1975) and Marubeni also of Japan had shown interest. Both Japanese
companies yesterday presented sealed envelopes declining to bid.
The Ilo refinery was constructed and has existed for nearly 20 years
exclusively to refine blister copper from SPCC under a tolling agreement.
The electrolytic plant - which cost USDollars 56m to build - was designed to
produce 150,000 tonnes a year of 99.9 per cent pure cathode copper. Later
modifications carried out on a shoestring by permanently cash-strapped
Mineroperu have since pushed output up by 20 per cent.
It was reasoned that purchasing the refinery would allow SPCC sharply to
reduce production costs for its refined copper. Mineroperu charged USDollars
300 a tonne to refine but that could easily be cut by USDollars 50.
Additionally, the new proprietor would benefit from the 2m ounces or so of
silver produced annually as a by-product, which had previously remained with
Mineroperu.
An official in the privatisation committee for state mining and refining
giant Centromin said in Lima yesterday that the base price for the company
would be Dollars 280m in cash plus at least Dollars 60m in debt paper and
minimum investment of Dollars 240m over three years. The sale is scheduled
for late March.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Accountancy Column: Pieces of Cadbury still await
consumption - Andrew Jack explains that two of the report's mostvital
recommendations have yet to be implemented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unlucky 13 months or more after launching his report on the financial
aspects of corporate governance, Sir Adrian Cadbury must be beginning to
wonder whether its final chapters will ever be completed.
While companies are now frequently making reference to the code in their
accounts, they have had to be assured that they need only comment on those
aspects for which final guidelines have been issued and come into force. Two
vital elements are still missing.
Introduced into the committee's debates relatively late in the process, and
squeezed almost as a casual aside into the draft text, are a couple of
points with which companies are expected to comply but for which guidelines
have still to be finalised.
The first says that 'directors should report on the effectiveness of
internal control, and the auditors should report on their statement'.
The second says 'directors should state in the report and accounts that the
business is a going concern, with supporting assumptions or qualifications
as necessary, and the auditors should report on this statement'.
The two phrases seem innocuous enough. But rarely have so few words
triggered such ferocious debate, lengthy expositions and inordinate delay.
The disputes are still very much alive.
In fact, the way things are going, it may well be early next year, if at
all, before companies are in a position to start complying with the going
concern and internal control recommendations. That would be just a few
months before Cadbury's sponsors are charged with appointing, by the end of
June 1995, a new group to assess progress and develop new suggestions.
Existing guidance is certainly weak. Present companies legislation requires
directors to maintain adequate accounting records to enable them disclose
the financial position of the company at any time with reasonable accuracy.
That suggests the need for internal controls without any explicit
requirement.
The companies acts also require accounts to be prepared on the presumption
that the company is a going concern, defined in SSAP 2, the accounting
standard on disclosure of policies, as likely to continue for the
foreseeable future. Auditing guidelines, in turn, say this is normally six
months after the date of the audit report or a year after the balance sheet
date, whichever is the longer. The specific requirements are vague.
The sting in the tail is the second sentence of each of the two Cadbury
recommendations: that the accountancy profession together with preparers of
accounts should develop criteria and guidance on the topics for companies
and auditors.
Getting a group of accountants and company executives to agree has proved
far harder than probably anyone initially expected. How useful any final
wording will be remains open to question.
The troubles first began last June with a speech by Michael Lawrence, the
former finance director of Prudential and chairman of the 100 Group of
finance directors of leading companies, who recently became chief executive
of the Stock Exchange. He was critical of 'corporate overload' as a result
of so many new sets of guidelines.
The result was the 'overload group', which has since met regularly to help
co-ordinate discussions and ideas. In practice, this has meant delays for
the guidelines on internal controls and the going concern statement.
One of Lawrence's prime concerns - echoed by much of business - was (and
remains) that the internal controls proposals ranged far more widely than
Cadbury's initial suggestions, with excessive and potentially meaningless
disclosures.
Even the accountancy profession, which might stand to gain new fees from
auditing and advising on more extensive internal control statements, is
divided. For example, Gerry Acher, making his mark as head of accounting and
auditing at KPMG Peat Marwick, says it focuses too far on the minutiae.
Mr Roger Davis, head of auditing at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, takes a similar view.
'The profession has taken a fairly simple concept - is the board doing the
right sort of thing on internal controls? - and turned it into dozens of
pages of technical detail,' he says. 'We are in danger of shooting our
clients in the back and ourselves in the foot.'
On the other hand, Paul Rutteman, a technical partner with Ernst &amp; Young,
who chairs the internal control working party, remains convinced of the need
for a statement. He argues that directors are already responsible for
maintaining internal controls, so they are not being placed under new
obligations; nor should they need to incur additional expense to provide a
statement.
However, he does concede that the existing guidance is too lengthy, and is
now working on a revised version with a remit to make it substantially
shorter.
The going concern debate has until recently taken place more behind the
scenes, because it has primarily been seen as an internal technical debate
for auditors and accountants. Yet its implications are as significant.
That all changed when the Auditing Practices Board issued its own draft
going concern guidance in December. This called for an extension of the
period over which auditors should gain reassurance that the company is
viable: for one year from the date on which the accounts are approved.
Meanwhile, the working group convened at the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to develop the Cadbury guidelines has
developed a different view: that rigorous going concern assurance is only
feasible up till the date of the next balance sheet. Beyond that, their
budgets and other information are more limited and the the assurance cannot
be as firm.
What this ignores - and the board has tried to rectify - is that companies
in financial difficulties may well delay signing the accounts until long
after the year-end, and just a few months before the next balance sheet
date, giving going concern assurance over a very short period.
Now Henry Gold, technical director of the institute, is suggesting a
compromise: that reassurance over an extended period should be provided in
the operating and financial review section of the annual report.
It is clear that both the internal controls and going concern issues still
deserve considerably more debate before final conclusions are reached. But
that still ignores a more fundamental question: whether either statement
will make any real difference to corporate governance.
The risk is that the wording chosen will veer in the direction of the text
in US annual reports, heavily vetted by lawyers and saying little that would
provide a public clue to any financial problems.
Mr Gold argues that the fact that directors are forced to make a public
statement on either subject will concentrate their minds and force them to
be more rigorous in meeting their legal obligations.
But if directors need to be reminded more fully of their obligations to
maintain internal controls and state whether their company is a going
concern, that would probably be best achieved by a change to the law.
If auditors are to be required to comment or contradict any such directors'
statements they believe to be false, there will also need to be far firmer
guidelines to force them in this direction.
Merely adding new text triggers the danger of simply producing more bland
text in the annual report, which readers will justifiably skip knowing that
its contents are all but meaningless.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: US long-dated buoyed by Treasury refunding
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US government bonds were firmer yesterday, after Tuesday's sell-off, with
prices on the long end of the yield curve posting moderate gains following a
Treasury announcement on new supply.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 better at 99
19/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.275 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.181 per cent.
The day's economic data had little impact.
The Commerce Department said its composite index of leading indicators rose
0.7 per cent in December, as forecast, while sales of new homes surged to
their highest level in five years.
However, most analysts dismissed the reports as old news.
After shedding about a point in the previous session, long-dated securities
opened higher on overseas buying, but slipped back when traders failed to
follow through on the early activity.
However, trading picked up soon after the Treasury revealed the details of
its quarterly refunding package, to be offered next week. The long bond
posted solid gains when the announcement of a Dollars 40bn sale of new
securities produced no surprises.
Traders then turned their attention to tomorrow's employment data, which
would provide evidence on whether the economy has slowed significantly in
the first quarter.
Gilt prices ended little changed, in spite of a Treasury report suggesting
continued recovery, which further weakened the likelihood of another
interest rate cut in the near future, dealers said.
The focus is shifting to next week's January retail prices data.
The data is expected to show that inflation is well under control and could
help revive interest in the market.
'I don't think we need a rate cut to get the market to move,' said Mr Mark
Reckless, UK economist at S. G. Warburg. 'A good retail price index number
will focus international attention' on the market, he added.
No details had emerged by the end of the day of the meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England.
March Gilt futures on Liffe ended down  1/16 point at 118 1/2 .
Japanese government bond prices slid in European trading, as the market
received confirmation of some aspects of the new fiscal package, which is to
be unveiled today.
'The key issue is how it will all be financed,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief
economist at DKB International.
The expectation is that the bulk of the package will be financed by raising
debt. This was reinforced yesterday by the news that the new welfare tax,
replacing consumption tax, is only coming into force in 1997.
Concerns about bond market supply dampened the reception of yesterday's
Y100bn two-year auction.
The market is likely to remain wary ahead of next week's Y700bn four-year
auction.
'I think a lot of the supply worries have already been taken on board, but
we are in the run up to the end of the fiscal year,' said Mr Lyons.
However, he added that the current weakness appeared to be a temporary
problem.
German government bonds eased in quiet trading yesterday ahead of the
Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting today. Traders said the market was
evenly split on the prospects of the central bank cutting interest rates
after the meeting.
However, they added that the release of better-than-expected industrial
production data for December might persuade the Bundesbank to delay a cut in
rates until its next meeting.
The March bund future on Liffe traded at 100.35 in the late afternoon, down
0.06 on the day and down from an intraday high of 100.48.
The yield on 10-year French government bonds slipped back above the yield on
bunds yesterday due to fears that the Bank of France might cut interest
rates independently of the Bundesbank. After breaking below the yield on
bunds last week, the yield on 10-year OATs had widened to three basis points
above bunds by yesterday afternoon.
Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in
London, said although the French economy would benefit from a cut in
interest rates, it would lead to a weakening in the French franc. 'This
would have a knock-on effect on OATs,' he said.
The notional March bond future traded at 130.28 in the late afternoon, down
0.10 on the day.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: China to issue Yn100bn in
Treasuries this year

<TEXT>
China is planning to issue Yn100bn in Treasury bonds for 1994 to meet the
voracious demands of infrastructure spending. This more than doubles last
year's Yn40bn float.
The finance ministry on Tuesday began marketing a second batch of bonds for
the year worth Yn10bn. The one-year bonds carry an interest rate of 11.98
per cent.
Chinese officials expect a better response to this year's flotation than
last year. The government encouraged individuals and institutions in 1993 to
buy bonds after a disappointing response.
Investors found coupon rates in an inflationary environment on the 1993
issue unappealing. They favoured alternatives such as equities, but the poor
performance of China's stock markets this year will have improved bond
prospects.
The finance ministry said the doubling of the bond issue for this year
compared with 1993 was dictated by government demand for funds.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Polish minister offers to
abandon share tax scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Leszek Miller, Poland's minister of labour and one of the most left-wing
members in the centre-left Polish government, told a meeting of large
private investors that he would no longer press for his proposed tax on
stock exchange transactions. The move was designed to calm investors' fears
after a bout of selling on the Warsaw stock exchange.
Investors argued that the proposed 0.5 per cent transactions tax
contradicted earlier legislation.
This provided for tax exemption on transactions and stock market profits
until the end of 1995.
Investors warned it would jeopardise the government's hopes of raising large
funds for the budget from the privatisation of state enterprises.
Mr Miller hoped to raise about Dollars 18m a month from the proposed tax in
order to increase social payments as promised in his party's election
manifesto.
However, he was criticised by the finance minister and others within his own
party. He finally backed down after heavy selling on the Warsaw stock
exchange over its last two sessions.
The selling, after months of steady buying, was also sparked off by a row
between the two coalition partners over the sacking of the minister in
charge of bank privatisation and warnings by Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, a former
finance minister, that the stock exchange bubble was about to burst.
Warsaw's WIG index reached a record 18,218 last Thursday but tumbled to
15,227 on Tuesday.
Trading, which takes place only three days a week, resumes today.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Beijing's long-awaited global bond
lifts quiet sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's long-awaited global bond was the focus of a lacklustre day in the
Eurobond market, where activity was subdued ahead of today's meeting of the
Bundesbank council.
The People's Republic of China issued Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds, priced
to yield 85 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury bond, with
Merrill Lynch as lead manager. Dealers reported strong demand for the issue
from Asian and European accounts. The pricing of the bond was brought
forward by a day and syndicate is due to break today.
The issue yesterday was assigned a triple-B rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, two
notches below Moody's A-3 rating for China's foreign currency debt.
However, Standard &amp; Poor's stressed its positive rating outlook for China
which 'reflects the likelihood that political and macroeconomic developments
in China will support progressive, albeit uneven, implementation of the
economic reform programme which over time should strengthen policy-makers'
ability to manage future inflation and external payments pressures'.
In the Eurosterling market, the Royal Bank of Scotland issued Pounds 500m of
10-year bonds via S. G. Warburg, UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The
bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points above the 6 3/4 per cent gilt due
2004. After the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened slightly,
traders said. While one of the lead managers reported strong continental
European and Asian demand for the issue, other dealers said placement was
likely to be slow.
'It was too big and a bit too tight for current market conditions,' said one
trader. After the recent slew of issues by financial institutions, he said
investors were more interested in high-quality corporate paper. However,
traders said more financial institutions were queueing up to tap the
sterling market, especially in the undated sector.
Elsewhere, General Electric Capital Corporation issued Dollars 250m of
two-year bonds via CS First Boston. Yielding two basis points over
Treasuries at the re-offer price, the deal was deemed to be tightly priced.
However, the lead manager said the spread was largely irrelevant as the
paper would be placed with European retail investors who were keen on
short-dated dollar bonds from a top-notch borrower. He pointed out that most
GECC bonds traded at yields well below Treasuries.
The European Investment Bank is said to be preparing the launch of the first
Greek drachma Eurobond. Market sources are talking of bonds with a coupon of
no more than 18 per cent and a five-year maturity, to be issued in the next
two weeks. The HSBC Group and a Greek bank are tipped as lead managers.
The Republic of Iceland made its debut in the Yankee bond market, issuing
Dollars 200m of 10-year notes via J. P. Morgan Securities. The 6 1/8 per
cent notes were priced to 57 basis point over the relevant US benchmark.

<TEXT>
Canada's biggest department store retailer, Sears Canada, turned round in
the final quarter of 1993, putting the chain into the black for the first
time in two years.
The company, which operates 110 stores and about 1,500 catalogue businesses,
has undergone a substantial restructuring.
Net profit in the December quarter was CDollars 50.6m (USDollars 38.1m), or
53 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 3.7m, or 4 cents, a year
earlier, on revenues little changed at CDollars 1.3bn. Profit for all 1993
was CDollars 4.4m, or 5 cents, against a loss of CDollars 90.9m, or CDollars
1.44, on revenues of almost CDollars 4bn, little changed.

Inco, faced with the lowest nickel prices in six years, posted a
fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 39.2m, or 36 cents a common share, against
a loss of USDollars 30.1m, or 28 cents, a year earlier, on net sales of
Dollars 516m against Dollars 612m.
Helped by a strong third quarter, the world's leading nickel-copper-platinum
producer reported net profit for all 1993 of Dollars 24m, or 22 cents,
against a loss of Dollars 22.3m, or 21 cents, on net sales of Dollars 2.13bn
against Dollars 2.56bn.
The results were slightly worse than analysts expected. The figures are
stated after preferred dividends in both years. In 1993, Inco included a
Dollars 187m gain from the sale of a subsidiary.
Realised nickel prices were the lowest since 1987, said Inco. The average
was Dollars 2.42 a pound in the fourth quarter and Dollars 2.72 in all 1993,
down 20 per cent from 1992.
Inco reduced output by 33m lbs last year and will make another cut of 40m
lbs in the first quarter this year. Prices have strengthened recently and
Inco says its production plans for the remainder of 1994 are flexible.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Petro-Canada steps up
exploration in west as profits climb sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Petro-Canada, the privatised national oil company that has been undergoing a
restructuring, has reported a sharp increase in fourth-quarter profits. The
group is also stepping up exploration in western Canada.
Profits for the quarter advanced to CDollars 36m (USDollars 27m), or 15
cents a share, up 33 per cent from CDollars 27m, or 12 cents, a year
earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.15bn, down 8 per cent.
For the whole of 1993 profit was CDollars 162m, or 66 cents a share, up from
CDollars 9m, or 4 cents, on revenues of CDollars 4.6bn, a fall of 2 per
cent.
The group's 1994 capital spending programme will total CDollars 555m, for
upgrading its refineries and contributing to the offshore Hibernia oil
project.
PetroCan has been restructured since early 1992, with successive asset sales
and cost reductions.
Oil and gas output rose last year but operating profit declined because of
lower crude oil prices. Downstream operations, however, improved
significantly.
In 1994 the group will invest CDollars 125m in western exploration, CDollars
155m in refining and CDollars 210m in the 25 per cent-owned Hibernia
project. This is running into serious cost overruns, and PetroCan's original
CDollars 1bn commitment over five years may not be sufficient.
Hyundai of Korea, a platform contractor, is considering taking over
management of the CDollars 5bn-plus project. Rio Algom, now primarily a base
metals mining group, is raising CDollars 157m by a fully underwritten issue
of shares with warrants attached at CDollars 22.50 per unit.
Part of the proceeds will be used for investment in Chile's Cerro Colorado
copper project.
Canada Trust, with CDollars 150bn assets under management, has bought 80 per
cent of Toronto discount broker Meridian Securities from the Royal Bank of
Canada and management, and plans to move into insurance. CT has nearly 400
branches in Canada and owns a US savings and loan company.

<TEXT>
Reebok International, the US sports-shoe maker, reported net income of
Dollars 50.7m from continuing operations, little changed from Dollars 49.8m
last time, writes Richard Tomkins.
Poor sales of its athletic shoes were largely to blame: Reebok footwear
sales in the US were nearly 23 per cent lower than in the previous year's
fourth quarter.
For the year, Reebok appeared to show a sharp improvement in net income to
Dollars 223.4m from Dollars 114.4m. However, profits from continuing
operations were virtually flat at Dollars 230.4m, compared with Dollars
232.3m last time.
Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the company was
disappointed by the decline in US footwear sales in the second half, but the
year ended with orders up 14.4 per cent overall.
There had been good performances from the US apparel business, Reebok's
international business, and Rockport's international outdoor and women's
footwear businesses.

<TEXT>
Polaroid, the US photography group, increased fourth-quarter net profits to
Dollars 39.2m from Dollars 29.6m in the previous year.
However, the group warned that the first half of the current year would
reflect the effects of slow economic growth in Europe, the stronger US
dollar and start-up costs on a coating facility.
For the full year, it reported net losses of Dollars 51.3m, compared with
profits of Dollars 99m last time, partly because of the severence payments
and accounting changes.
Operating profits, excluding the unusual items, would have been Dollars
208m, against Dollars 214m last time, the company said.
The fourth-quarter profits growth was caused partly by a strong response
from US consumers to a new instant camera system called Captiva.
The system helped the company reach its largest number of camera shipments
in 10 years.
Polaroid said it expected to increase operating profits significantly in the
current year in spite of weakness in the first half.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fokker's latest restructuring
plan fails to get off the ground - Dutch aircraft manufacturer faces a tough
task after the chairman's unexpected resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, is being forced to go back to the drawing
board again this week.
This time, the sketches being worked out at the company's Amsterdam
headquarters are not the contours of a new regional jet or the shape of a
turbo-prop commuter aircraft. Instead, Fokker, which has had more than its
share of turbulence over the past 12 months - particularly the sale of a
controlling majority stake to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany in April
 -is trying to draw up new plans for deep cuts in operating costs.
The company's restructuring plans were thrown into disarray on Monday when
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn resigned after failing to win approval for his vision
of how the cost price of Fokker's aircraft could be cut by 30 per cent over
the next three years.
Fokker is expected to launch a new plan later this month, even though a new
permanent chairman has yet to be appointed. Mr Nederkoorn has been replaced
temporarily by his vice-chairman, Mr Reinder van Duinen.
Mr Nederkoorn's plans were considered too drastic by his management board
and by his fellow Dutchmen on the supervisory board, where the Germans have
a majority.
Ironically, however, his unexpected departure may spur Dasa, which is facing
job losses and difficulties of its own, to push the new management team to
carry out an even stronger rationalisation of Fokker's operations and
finances. Significantly, Dutch trade unions have bemoaned Mr Nederkoorn's
resignation and are bracing for further bad news.
One immediate consequence of this week's board shake-up - which besides Mr
Nederkoorn's departure also includes the doubling of the management board to
six members - is the appointment of a German, Mr Reinhard Volk, to the new
board-level position of controller.
Mr Volk, who will join Fokker from the engine-maker MTU - which, like Dasa,
is part of the Daimler-Benz group - is the first German to join the
management board since the takeover.
Mr Nederkoorn envisaged a loss of between 1,000 and 1,200 jobs out of a
total of 10,000 at Fokker. This reduction would have come hard on the heels
of earlier job cuts that have steadily whittled down the size of the
workforce from 13,500 in 1990.
Equally controversial were plans for a wholesale shake-up of Fokker's
corporate culture, including proposals to divide the company's internal
component supply departments into smaller units of 300 to 400 employees
each, which would be made responsible for their own profit-and-loss
statements.
The plans were based on the premise that Fokker should have just enough
employees to build at least 60 aircraft a year, a far cry from the minimum
100 budgeted for as recently as 1990. Under a new restructuring plan, that
number may have to be reduced still further to around 50.
The number of job losses could rise to 2,000, and some of Fokker's
manufacturing sites outside Amsterdam may have to close. But so far, the
company has refused to discuss the contours of the new plan.
Fokker, like other aircraft makers, is feeling the pinch because of the
troubles being experienced by the world's airlines. Before the boardroom
dispute erupted, it had been predicting a loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 77m) for
1993.
Mr Nederkoorn's downfall is also partly a legacy of the bitterness aroused
by Dasa's acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in the company.
The German takeover, which sparked a debate with nationalistic overtones
about the Netherlands' industrial future, was Mr Nederkoorn's
responsibility, and his forthright manner caused friction inside and outside
the company.
Although Dasa is reported to want to go further than Mr Nederkoorn in
restructuring Fokker, it decided in the end not to back him personally
because of the boardroom split.
Ironically, Fokker's management troubles come when it has managed to pull
off a string of important orders which, although they cannot hope to rival
the bigger deals seen in the 1980s, testify to the company's continued
competitiveness.
In late January, Air UK ordered eight 50-seater Fokker 50s and took out
options on eight more. The order was regarded as important because sales of
Fokker 50s had stagnated lately.
Late last year, Fokker also won orders for its newest aeroplane, the Fokker
70, from Mesa Airlines of the US and from British Midland. The Fokker 70,
launched in mid-1993, has now won customers in the US, Asia and Europe.
But in the short term, the most important product to spring from Fokker's
drawing board will have to be an economically viable restructuring plan
capable of winning political and popular support in the Netherlands.

for expansion with record result
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has signalled an ambition
to spread its wings beyond North America with new ventures in China and
Peru.
Barrick yesterday outlined its international expansion strategy, which will
be centred on Latin America and Asia, in tandem with details of its eighth
consecutive year of record earnings.
Net income was USDollars 213.4m in 1993, or 75 cents a share, up from
Dollars 174.9m, or 62 cents, the previous year. Revenues rose to Dollars
667.5m from Dollars 540.4m.
However, the momentum slowed in the fourth quarter, with a lower realised
gold price, higher costs and sagging output pushing net income down to
Dollars 51.8m, or 18 cents a share, from Dollars 65.5m, or 23 cents.
Barrick's active gold hedging programme realised an average price of Dollars
409 per ounce last year, down from Dollars 422 an ounce in 1992. In the
fourth quarter, the price fell to an average of Dollars 405.
Output for the year was 1.64m ounces, up from 1.33m ounces, largely due to
expanding production at the flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada.
Barrick said its international drive was prompted by changed attitudes and
structures in several countries 'which makes it attractive to review the
mining opportunities they may present'. It plans to focus on deposits
capable of producing at least 100,000 ounces of gold a year for 15 years or
more.
Barrick will own 75 per cent of a new gold development venture in China
formed in partnership with Power Corporation of Canada, the diversified
Montreal-based financial services group.
It has also taken an option on a 75 per cent interest in the Corona gold and
copper project in southern Peru, and joined two exploration projects in
north-central and southern Peru.
Barrick said its international expansion would be facilitated by its
contacts and strong balance sheet. Several non-mining luminaries sit on its
board of directors, including former Canadian prime minister Mr Brian
Mulroney.
Cash reserves totalled almost Dollars 350m at the end of last year.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Petrofina forecasts rise to
BFr7.1bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Petrofina, the oil company and Belgium's largest industrial group, yesterday
forecast consolidated profits for last year of BFr7.1bn (Dollars 198.9m),
against BFr4.6bn in 1992.
Turnover figures are not yet available.
The preliminary result amounts to a bounce back from a poor first half, and
Mr Francois Cornelis, chief executive, expected Petrofina would pay out
roughly the same amount in dividends as last year, when it paid a total of
BFr6.7bn.
Petrofina cut its dividend in 1992 for the first time since 1959, after a 72
per cent collapse in earnings. Mr Cornelis said cash-flow had strengthened
slightly to BFr34bn, against BFr32bn in 1992. The group has refocused on
core activities, and expects 5 per cent annual productivity gains through
investment and the shedding of more than 2,000 jobs since 1991.
Its BFr26bn upgrading of its Antwerp refinery should be completed by
September, while overall investment this year should be maintained at recent
levels, roughly BFr33bn.
The results reflect a rising dollar and improved refining margins, up from
Dollars 2.33 a barrel in 1992 to Dollars 2.90 last year, but were offset by
a decline of more than Dollars 2 in crude oil prices to an average Dollars
17 per barrel in 1993.
Petrofina expects to increase production of oil and gas by 15 per cent this
year, through its share in four fields coming on stream.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rogers takes telecoms takeover
race into Canada

<TEXT>
The race for leadership in the turbulent telecommunications industry reached
Canada yesterday with a bid by Rogers Communications, the country's biggest
cable TV operator, for Maclean Hunter, whose diverse communications
interests include a large range of North American cable franchises.
Rogers has yet to disclose details of its offer. Although Mr Ted Rogers,
founder and chief executive, yesterday described the proposal as 'a
strategic merger,' MH said it had received an approach for a 'possible
takeover'.
Rogers has already bought an 8.3 per cent stake in MH, a company which had a
market value of CDollars 2.85bn before the bid was announced. Mr Rogers said
the board would meet on February 4, and would make a statement afterwards.
MH reacted cautiously to Rogers' overtures, saying that it would consider a
specific proposal 'in light of its other strategic alternatives and with a
view to the best interests of MH and its shareholders'.
One analyst said that many MH institutional shareholders might be tempted to
accept an offer if it was pitched substantially above MH's pre-bid share
price of CDollars 13.75. The shares have barely moved in the past two years,
but the analyst estimated that the company was worth over CDollars 20 a
share for a cash-cum-shares bid.
Rogers faces numerous hurdles. The two companies are a study in contrasts.
Rogers, which is closely identified with Mr Rogers, is an aggressive,
highly-leveraged group with leading-edge technology. It has suffered losses
for the past five years, reaching CDollars 124m in the first nine months of
1993.
Besides its 14 cable-TV systems, Rogers controls a national cellular phone
network, and is a part owner of Unitel, the long-distance phone company
which was instrumental two years ago in breaking a monopoly held by local
phone companies.
MH, with a history spanning 107 years, is widely-held and conservatively
managed, with little debt and a steady dividend. For many years, the
backbone of its business was trade publications, newspapers, and local radio
and TV stations. However, its cable-TV franchises in the US and Canada last
year contributed almost 90 per cent of operating earnings, totalling
CDollars 194m.

The French government is injecting FFr2bn (Dollars 341m) into Aerospatiale
to help the state-owned aircraft and defence company promote its new Airbus
330-340 programmes and improve its finances.
The government has put Aerospatiale on its list of state companies to be
sold into the private sector. However, it suggested recently that in the
near term letting industrial partners take a stake in the company was far
more likely than privatisation.
Aerospatiale has forecast a 1993 loss 'significantly less' than 1992's
FFr2.38bn.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paramount sees loss of up to
Dollars 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paramount Communications, the entertainment group at the centre of a Dollars
10bn takeover battle, yesterday announced that it expected a third-quarter
net loss of between Dollars 35m and Dollars 40m.
The loss is due partly to a revaluation of programme inventories and partly
the box office performance of Addams Family Values, a comedy horror film.
The news reinforced the belief of some Wall Street analysts that Viacom and
QVC Network, rival bidders for Paramount, are paying a very high price for a
business with a falling financial performance.
The forecast loss for the quarter to January 31 works through at 29 cents to
33 cents a share, and compares with analysts' expectations of earnings of 5
cents to 15 cents a share.
In the same period of last year, Paramount lost Dollars 66.8m, or 56 cents a
share, but that included a one-time charge of Dollars 66.9m for a change in
accounting principles.
The company said USA Network, an advertiser-supported cable channel which it
owns jointly with MCA, expected to record a Dollars 78m pre-tax charge to
adjust the carrying value of certain broadcast rights to net realisable
value.
This stems mainly from the poor ratings of the comedy series Major Dad in
its debut on the network, and will leave Paramount with an Dollars 18m
after-tax loss in the third quarter.
Paramount also forecast a loss in its motion picture division, due to an
unexpected write-down on Addams Family Values, which was released in the US
last November and has taken some Dollars 46m at the domestic box office.
The company said it expected its television programming operations to
produce lower operating income because it was increasing production for the
broadcasting networks, which involves the studio in higher up-front costs.
Its publishing operations would report larger seasonal losses - although in
line with its full-year business plan - primarily because of higher product
development and selling expenses to meet anticipated sales growth.
On the positive side, the company said it expected sharply higher results
from its home video operations and increased operating income from broadcast
television stations and Madison Square Garden, the New York concert and
sports venue.
Two of the company's biggest box office successes in 1993 - Indecent
Proposal and The Firm - have been issued in video in the US in recent
months.

McGraw-Hill, the US publisher and broadcaster, expects to show financial
progress in 1994 after flat fourth-quarter earnings, and a loss for 1993 due
to an acquisition charge, Reuter reports from New York.
It said it took a non-recurring charge of Dollars 160.8m, or Dollars 3.27 a
share, for a 50 per cent interest in MacMillan/McGraw-Hill School
Publishing.
As a result, 1993 earnings were Dollars 11.4m, or 23 cents, against Dollars
28.6m, or 58 cents.
For the fourth quarter ended December 31, the company reported earnings of
Dollars 44.9m, or 91 cents, compared with Dollars 44.7m, or 91 cents, in the
fourth quarter of 1992.

Shares in Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telecommunications
group, rose on Wall Street yesterday after the company reported a sharp
profits advance.
Strong growth in long-distance and local telephone volume lifted income from
continuing operations 63 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 190m, on
revenues of Dollars 2.98bn, up 10 per cent.
The results were a record for Sprint, as was the Dollars 11.4bn in revenues
it reported for the year as a whole.
Full-year operating earnings totalled Dollars 687m, up from Dollars 452m in
1992, but the figure does not include the Dollars 206m non-recurring
after-tax charges Sprint took during the year to cover restructurings, tax
law changes and the merger with Centel, also of the US.
During the fourth quarter, Sprint said its long distance operating income
grew by 26 per cent to Dollars 133m, with revenues up 7 per cent to Dollars
1.6bn and long distance use also up 7 per cent.
Among the new products introduced by Sprint recently is the Voice Foncard, a
voice-activated calling card that allows users to make a call by speaking
into the telephone rather than pushing buttons.
Sprint's local business was also buoyant in the fourth quarter, with
operating income rising 28 per cent to Dollars 251m on revenues of Dollars
1.08bn, up from Dollars 989m a year earlier.
Sprint shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 in New York.

Net earnings at SAP, the German-based business software company, rose 15 per
cent to DM146m (Dollars 83.4m) last year on sales up by more than 30 per
cent at DM1.1bn.
Turnover from the company's R/2 and R/3 mainframe-based systems rose to
DM684m, compared with DM471m in 1992, while consulting work and training
contributed a further DM388m, against DM337m.
SAP said yesterday it had more than doubled its UK customer base in the past
year to 55 companies.
Sales in the UK rose 46 per cent to Pounds 10m (Dollars 15m). The company,
which aims to make half its sales outside Germany in the current year, said
turnover in the US increased by 150 per cent from an estimated DM84m in
1992.
It also achieved its target of a 10-fold sales increase to more than 1,000
packages of its R/3 software generation, designed to appeal to smaller and
medium-sized companies.
The company, with 3,000 clients worldwide, last year increased its workforce
by 17.5 per cent to more than 3,500. Sales per employee increased from
DM283,000 to DM319,000.

<TEXT>
Mr Charles Ward, one of the founding partners of investment banking firm
Wasserstein Perella, has rejoined CS First Boston, marking the latest in a
run of senior defections in the mergers and acquisitions sector in the US.
Mr Ward was one of four senior First Boston executives who founded the
advisory boutique in 1988, along with co-heads of investment banking Bruce
Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, at the time the two most celebrated M&amp;A
advisers on Wall Street.
He is now rejoining the bank (since renamed CS First Boston) as joint head
of investment banking and head of the investment banking business in Europe.
Mr Ward was made president of Wasserstein Perella's advisory unit last July,
after Mr Perella defected to join Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley itself had
earlier lost Mr Bob Greenhill, one of Wall Street's top advisers, to Smith
Barney Shearson.
Wasserstein Perella, which has experienced a dearth of M&amp;A business compared
with its prominent role in the late-1980s, played down the significance of
the departure. 'Chuck got offered a job that was too good to be true,' one
senior executive said, adding that the move did not reflect any
dissatisfaction with Wasserstein.
The executive added that the bank had seen a pick-up in M&amp;A work, including
advising Bell South on its investment in QVC to back the home-shopping
company's bid for Paramount.
Mr Ward, 41, joins CS First Boston as it is trying to build a more broadly
based international investment banking business. It has been held back in
the past by rivalries between its strong London and US-based operations.
The competition for M&amp;A specialists has intensified in recent months,
signalling a belief by investment banks that the business will continue to
rebound after a three-year lull.

quarter
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain which has agreed to merge
with cable television group Viacom, yesterday reported a 71 per cent
increase in fourth-quarter net income.
It made Dollars 81.3m, or 34 cents a share, compared with Dollars 47.6m, or
23 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues were up 66 per cent at
Dollars 724m.
Same-store revenues for company-owned video outlets in operation for more
than a year increased 5.5 per cent in the quarter and 9.2 per cent in the
year.
Blockbuster is being taken over by Viacom as part of the cable company's
Dollars 10bn bid to buy Paramount Commun-ications, the film and publishing
group, in a five-month battle pitting it against rival bidder QVC Network.
However, the Viacom-Blockbuster deal is not contingent on Viacom winning the
Paramount battle.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, said the company expected its
merger with Viacom to be completed in the second quarter.
For the full year, the group reported net income of Dollars 243m, or Dollars
1.10 a share, up 64 per cent from the Dollars 148.3m, or 76 cents, reported
in 1992. Revenues totalled Dollars 2.2bn, up 69 per cent.
Systemwide revenues - revenues generated by the company and franchise owned
stores - rose 49 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 891m and 47 per
cent in the year, to Dollars 2.9bn.
Mr Huizenga said that during the quarter the company's home video and music
retail operations, along with its programming and distribution businesses,
posted strong gains in both revenue and operating income.

Dollars 1bn

<TEXT>
The State Bank of India, India's largest state-run bank, has raised Rs32bn
(Dollars 1bn) in the country's largest bond and share funding package.
The bank has raised 42 per cent more than its Rs22.5bn target. The recent
surge in the Indian stock market, fuelled by foreign buying, encouraged 2.6m
investors to apply for SBI stock.
With the additional capital, SBI will be one of the largest companies in
India by market capitalisation. Its stock should be attractive to foreign
investors because it will be widely held and therefore easily traded.
As a result of the combined sale of shares and bonds, which started in
December and finished last week, the government's stake in SBI - held
through Reserve Bank of India, the central bank - will fall to 66 per cent
from 98 per cent.
'This was the biggest offering in India by any standards,' says Mr R.
Viswanathan, the bank's deputy managing director, who supervised the
fundraising. The funds are being used to bolster the bank's capital base to
make it better able to compete with other banks, including state-owned
institutions, foreign banks and a new batch of privately-run banks which are
being approved as part of the government's financial deregulation programme.
Mr Viswanathan says SBI will now have more than enough capital to meet the 8
per cent ratio of capital to assets laid down by international regulations.
SBI, the first of India's 26 state-owned banks to be partially privatised,
is one of the world's largest banks in terms of staff and branches, with
more than 200,000 employees in 8,800 offices. India's restrictive labour
laws have prevented SBI from streamlining manpower. Nearly 2,400 of its
branches lose money, but the bank will find it difficult to close them
without reform of the labour laws and co-operation from trade unions.
Banking unions have been unable to stop partial privatisation but their
opposition has helped to convince the government to retain control of
state-owned enterprises by holding at least 51 per cent. They have also
secured promises from finance ministry officials and bank managers that
there will be no compulsory job cuts in banking.
Mr Viswanathan says that there will be 'no retrenchment' at SBI but the
payroll will gradually be cut through voluntary retirement and
non-replacement.
SBI made an operating profit of Rs2.12bn in the year to last March, up from
Rs1.75bn. Net profits, including investment income, fell from Rs25.9bn to
Rs18.5bn, partly because of losses of Rs7.06bn incurred in the 1992 Bombay
securities market scandal, when money was illegally siphoned from banks into
stocks and shares.

Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, is to reduce sharply its
south Pacific services to Australia, but will increase flights between the
US and Japan.
Northwest, which was the focus of a Pacific routes dispute between the US
and Australian governments last year, is the latest airline to announce it
is withdrawing or substantially reducing its US-Australia services.
The carrier said it would suspend its thrice-weekly service between Sydney
and Los Angeles, and cut its weekly frequencies from Sydney to Detroit via
Osaka from three to one. Resources would be deployed instead in expanded
Detroit-Tokyo and Los Angeles-Osaka services.
Northwest's move follows Continental Airlines' decision to pull out of the
Australasian market last autumn after 14 years.
American Airlines abandonned the south Pacific route in 1992.
United Airlines, the Chicago-based carrier, and Australia's Qantas have also
restructured their services in this area in an effort to improve returns,
although both carriers continue to provide services.

ITC, India's biggest manu-facturer of cigarettes, plans to set up an
export-oriented brewery in collaboration with Heineken, the Dutch brewer,
Reuter reports from Calcutta.
Company officials said a team from Heineken would visit Calcutta this month
or early in March to finalise collaboration details. 'We hope to begin work
by the middle of 1994,' one said.
ITC plans to invest Rs1bn (Dollars 39m) in a brewery with annual capacity of
200,000 litres and canning facilities. More than 60 per cent of the
investment will be for the canning plant.
ITC's foray into the beer business has been prompted by a recent
collaboration between Heineken and BAT Industries of the UK, the largest
shareholder in ITC.
ITC is understood to have short-listed locations in the south Indian state
of Andhra Pradesh and the western states of Maharashtra and Goa.
India, with a population of 890m, consumes 40m litres of beer a year.
Spirits are traditionally more popular, but demand for beer is growing by 14
per cent a year as bars modelled on the British 'pub' sprout up across the
industrialised states of Maharashtra and Karnataka.

<TEXT>
Portugal will not impose any restrictions on foreign participation in future
privatisations but the limit on foreign ownership of most previously
privatised companies will remain at 25 per cent, according to government
officials.
Until now, Portugal has limited foreign investment in most privatised
companies to between 5 and 30 per cent, in contravention of European Union
rules that prohibit any barriers to corporate ownership between member
states.
Mr Antonio de Sousa, Portugal's secretary of state for finance, travelled to
Brussels this week to inform Mr Henning Christophersen, European
Commissioner for economic affairs, that Portugal would drop all limits on
foreign participation in future privatisations.
Mr de Sousa said that Portuguese legislation approved last month also
extended the limit on foreign investment in previously privatised companies
to 25 per cent in cases where the restrictions had previously been lower.
This limit will not be lifted in the near future, he made clear.
Portugal's controversial limits on foreign investment have been highlighted
by the case of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, which directly and
indirectly controls 50 per cent of the capital of Banco Totta e Acores
(BTA), the first Portuguese bank to be privatised in 1989.
Portuguese law limits foreign ownership of BTA to 25 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japan Air Lines pins its hopes
on cutting costs - Michiyo Nakamoto looks at the latest medium-term
restructuring plan from the struggling Japanese carrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Tokyo's southern waterfront district of Tennozu Isle, construction began
last autumn on a 25-storey building that will be the proud new offices of
Japan Air Lines.
The image of a bright future evoked by the new building, which is being
built at a cost of Y43bn (Dollars 400m), contrasts sharply with the reality
of the airline's financial predicament.
The severity of JAL's difficulties was underlined by the announcement last
month of a four-year restructuring programme - the second medium-term
survival plan from JAL in just over a year.
The latest plan aims to reduce costs even further than the previous one, to
introduce measures to bring the airline's services more in line with
changing customer needs, and to increase competitiveness both at home and
abroad.
JAL's misfortune is a familiar tale of declining revenues from lucrative
first and business class travel, increased competition on international
routes and fierce price discounting.
While it has been seen as a slow-moving giant in the airline industry,
unable to shed a bureaucratic corporate culture inherited from its days as a
public company, JAL's problems are not entirely unique.
Its Japanese competitors, ANA and Japan Air Systems, are also reeling under
the effects of one of Japan's worst economic downturns since the second
world war.
The high cost structure which has severely damaged JAL's international
competitiveness is a problem common to Japanese businesses with fixed costs
in Japan, where property and service prices are notoriously high.
The situation has been aggravated by the recent sharp appreciation of the
yen against the US dollar. 'I see very little chance that JAL will be able
to compete against south-east Asian carriers or indeed with US carriers at
current exchange rates,' says Mr Paul Smith, industry analyst at James
Capel.
In the year to March 1993, the airline suffered a consolidated pre-tax loss
of Y54.9bn on revenues of Y1,283.8bn and passed its dividend.
JAL is more dependent on international travel than its domestic competitors
and has been damaged more by price competition from foreign airlines. It
also relies more heavily on customers being attracted to its prestige image
at a time when the Japanese are basing decisions increasingly on value for
money.
But JAL's woes have also put into focus the way it has been managed. The
company 'has not always been operated with a clarity of vision that one
would expect from a private company,' says Mr Smith.
Over the past several years, for example, JAL invested heavily in aircraft
on the assumption that business would continue to expand as strongly as it
had during the years of asset inflation. When the extra demand failed to
materialise, aircraft had to be stored in the US.
JAL was also caught in forward dollar rates agreements which it made on the
recommendation of its bankers. After the 1985 Plaza Agreement, JAL hedged up
to a third of its planned aircraft purchase needs for a period of 11 years
in forward rates. Since then the dollar's value against the yen has fallen
dramatically, leaving JAL committed to buy expensive dollars, although the
company will not reveal at what rate it must buy.
The airline's management of its subsidiaries has also come in for criticism
by unions. One cited 6 the purchase by a subsidiary of Essex House, a luxury
hotel in New York. Having bought it for Dollars 170m, the company was then
obliged to pump in at least another Dollars 100m to renovate the hotel.
While JAL agrees that this was somewhat more than budgeted, its subsidiary
'has a gorgeous hotel in New York now,' an official says.
If JAL is to reduce its workforce dramatically, bring in a larger number of
non-Japanese staff to cut wage costs and become a lean and mean operation
that can generate higher revenues, it needs the co-operation of its unions.
Even if its plan does manage to clear the unions, management could face
criticism if JAL fails to see the pick-up in revenues it desperately needs.
Market conditions so far this year have been worse than JAL had banked on at
the beginning of the fiscal year, with international passenger revenues down
13 per cent at mid-year and domestic traffic revenues down 3 per cent.
Hopes that its cost-cutting moves and a pick-up in demand would allow it to
break even this year, return to profitability next year and resume dividends
by the year to March 1996 are already beginning to look optimistic.
'The industry is highly leveraged and if there is a pick-up in passenger
revenues the company could see a strong turnround,' notes Mr Smith.
Given the continuing depressed state of the Japanese economy, however, JAL's
latest medium-term plan may not yet be the last plan for survival to come
from the airline.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is expected to launch a new 'up-country
board' for provincial companies this month with the planned listing of a
palm oil company.
Chumporn Palm Oil Industry Public Co said yesterday it was the first company
to receive preliminary approval from the SET.
The new category of companies, equivalent to the second board in other
countries, has less stringent conditions for capital and successive years of
profit than the main board.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said two companies had already been
approved and a further four or five were in the pipeline.
Stockbrokers say foreign institutional investors are likely to be interested
only in the larger companies on the provincial board, because the shares of
the smaller ones will be difficult to buy or sell in large enough amounts.
'We hope that this is the start of a trend that will open up opportunities
for other established up-country firms to gain access to the stock market,'
Chumporn Palm said in a statement. 'The public offering will allow CP Palm
to lower its funding costs as we continue to expand production of palm oil
and kernel oil.'
The company made a profit of Bt112m (Dollars 4.4m) in 1993 on revenues of
Bt430m.

Goodman Fielder, the Australian food company which takes in the Leiner and
Davis gelatine brands, is acquiring Panamericana de Grenetina (Pagsa), which
claims to be Mexico's largest gelatine manufacturer, for an undisclosed sum.
Goodman is buying the business via its Intergel division, and said the deal
would provide a wholly-owned gelatine production facility, and direct access
to the Mexican gelatine market. The initial impact on Intergel's revenues
will be small, adding about ADollars 15m (USDollars 10m) in sales.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Renault begins the breaking up -
John Ridding and Christopher Brown-Humes on the new Volvo relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Step by step, Renault is disentangling itself from its collapsed plans to
merge with Volvo.
Since December, when the deal was abandoned in the face of strong opposition
from Volvo's Swedish shareholders, the French state-owned company has
chipped away at the two groups' industrial accords, seeking to redefine
their relationship.
However, yesterday's announcement - that Renault had sold more than half its
equity holding in the Volvo parent company - is the first to affect the
complex web of cross-shareholdings which have bound the two companies since
they established their industrial alliance in 1990.
It raises the question of how far the unravelling will extend and what areas
of co-operation can remain. The French government's plans to privatise
Renault in the second half of this year and the uneasy state of the alliance
have given urgency to finding an answer.
Renault yesterday described the sale of 3.2m 'B' shares in Volvo as a
financial transaction. 'After the collapse of the merger we said that we
would regard our holding in AB Volvo like any other corporate investment,'
said the French company. 'Yesterday's move should be seen as part of that
approach.'
The financial incentives were attractive; the Volvo share price has risen 70
per cent since the merger plans fell through. Renault is estimated to have
made a profit of about FFr750m (Dollars 128m) on the sale of its shares, a
welcome addition to the balance sheet as the company endures a sharp and
protracted downturn in the French car industry.
Renault emphasised, however, that the reduction in its stake in the Volvo
parent company leaves its voting rights at 8.76 per cent, from just under 10
per cent. It also retains a 45 per cent holding in Volvo's truck operations
and 25 per cent in Volvo's car operations.
These shareholdings would be much more problematic to unravel, as would
Volvo's reciprocal shareholdings of 20 per cent in the Renault parent
company and 45 per cent in RVI, the French company's truck and bus division.
The future of these shareholdings is still under consideration by the two
groups, but they need not be dissolved ahead of privatisation, according to
the French government. 'There is no reason why we cannot privatise Renault
with Volvo's shareholding,' said one industry ministry official.
Industry observers are sceptical, however. 'Volvo could help the
privatisation process. If it retains its shares then the public offer would
be reduced. But after the rupture, Renault may be wary about having such a
large stake held by Volvo,' said one analyst. He said the decision would
probably depend on the shape of their commercial relationship.
This relationship has changed significantly since the collapse of the merger
and, in particular, over the past few weeks. The two companies' joint
project to develop a common platform to replace the Volvo 900 series and the
Renault Safrane has been shelved. Last week, Renault announced an agreement
to disband the joint purchasing and quality control organisations, both of
which had been at the centre of the merger strategy.
But co-operation in some areas continues. Renault will, for example, receive
Volvo engines for its Laguna model, which was launched last month in France.
The French group in turn supplies Volvo with engines and gearboxes for its
400 series.
This form of co-operation is relatively modest, however. Renault has similar
agreements with other carmakers, such as Peugeot, its domestic rival. Future
steps taken by the two groups are unlikely to bring them any closer.
The Swedish market has anticipated the gradual unwinding of the alliance
since the merger plan collapsed.
The expectation has been that the two companies would continue to
collaborate at a commercial level, where it is in both their interests to do
so, but that the formal structure of the alliance, cemented through
cross-shareholdings, would gradually dissolve.
Analysts say Volvo still needs a partner long-term to share research,
development and distribution costs, even though its short-term prospects are
favourable.
Profits are expected to rise over the next two years on the back of currency
gains, cost-cutting, and a strengthening of markets in the US, UK and
Sweden.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Viacom edges ahead in Dollars
10bn Paramount battle
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the cable television group, yesterday appeared to take a lead over
rival QVC Network as their Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount
Communications, the film and publishing group, entered what may be its final
phase.
Both bidders slightly improved their offers for Paramount on Tuesday night,
the date set by Paramount board for final bids.
Viacom was widely viewed on Wall Street yesterday as offering slightly more
attractive terms, although analysts cautioned that the offers were very
close.
However, the perception that QVC was the more likely to lose helped lift its
stock Dollars 2 to Dollars 46 3/4 , while Viacom's B shares dropped Dollars
 1/3 to Dollars 33 1/2 . Wall Street thinks both are over-paying, and the
market punishes whichever stock looks like winning.
Paramount, meanwhile, reinforced the belief that its financial performance
is deteriorating by announcing yesterday that it expected a net loss of
Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m in its third quarter. Paramount shares dropped
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 .
Paramount's board is expected to meet on Friday to consider the new bids,
and shareholders have until February 14 to decide. If neither side wins more
than 50 per cent of Paramount's stock by then, the five-month battle will
grind on until a victor emerges.
Viacom's new bid leaves unchanged its offer of Dollars 107 a share in cash
for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock, but improves the value of the
securities offered for the remaining 49.9 per cent. Analysts estimated the
combined value of its cash and stock offering at around Dollars 83 to
Dollars 84 a share.
QVC increased the cash in its offer from Dollars 92 a share to Dollars 104,
but simultaneously lowered the value of the securities element, leaving the
overall value of its bid at around Dollars 86 to Dollars 87 a share.
Some Dollars 500m of the Dollars 750m needed to boost its cash bid is coming
from BellSouth, the Baby Bell telephone company, which is buying a further
tranche of QVC stock.
Analysts said that while Viacom's bid was slightly lower in apparent value,
investors might prefer it because it offered a little more cash and a
guarantee to pay up to Dollars 12 a share to stockholders if its 'B' shares
trade below Dollars 48 in the year after a Paramount takeover.

losses

<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer company, yesterday highlighted the
severity of its financial problems by announcing a net loss before
restructuring costs of FFr3.42bn (Dollars 583m) last year against a
comparable loss of FFr2.45bn in 1992.
The announcement follows last week's demand from the European Commission for
the French government, which is the controlling shareholder in Bull, to
suspend plans for a FFr2.5bn capital injection into the ailing company.
Both the government and Bull have argued that the capital injection is part
of their plan to prepare Bull for eventual privatisation. However, the EC
has claimed that the capital increase was not accompanied by a fully-fledged
restructuring plan. The government has 30 days to present restructuring
proposals to the commission.
Meanwhile Bull, which reported a net loss after restructuring costs of
FFr4.72bn for 1992, suffered a fall in sales of 6.4 per cent to FFr28.25bn
in 1993. It also saw its operating losses escalate to FFr1.89bn from
FFr642m.

<TEXT>
Electrolux, the Swedish white goods manufacturer, saw its shares rise by 7
per cent yesterday after it doubled profits in the fourth quarter of 1993.
The advance reflected strong demand in north America, an improvement in
Europe, and the benefits of a group restructuring programme.
Profit after financial items rose to SKr589m (Dollars 75m) in the fourth
quarter from SKr280m in the same 1992 period, taking profits for the full
year to SKr1.55bn, up 53 per cent.
The group is maintaining its dividend at SKr6.25 per share. Last year the
pay-out was halved from SKr12.50.
The weak Swedish krona and cost-cutting helped the group compensate for
falling demand in key European markets.
Double-digit growth in all business areas pushed full-year sales up 24 per
cent to SKr100.1bn. Excluding currency effects, sales were only 4 per cent
higher. The group said demand fell by between 3 and 6 per cent in Europe
last year, but it noted higher demand for its products in north America.
Household appliances, Electrolux's biggest division, was the only unit to
report lower operating income. This is partly because the group took a
SKr250m restructuring provision in the final quarter and partly because
problems in North America and Spain wiped SKr500m off operating profits
early in the year.
By contrast, the group saw a strong improvement in operating income in its
outdoor products and industrial products divisions, and some improvement for
commercial appliances. All four divisions reported increased income in the
fourth quarter.

Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday announced a
price of FFr385 per share for the public offer of Elf Aquitaine, the oil
group which is the largest company to be privatised so far in the programme
to sell 21 publicly-owned groups.
The offer price, which was largely in line with forecasts, compares with
yesterday's closing price of FFr430. Industry analysts said they expected
healthy demand from individual investors, who have until February 10 to buy
or confirm existing orders for shares.
In line with previous privatisations, the largest single tranche of shares -
33.21m, with a possible clawback from institutional investors  - will be
allocated to individual investors.
The price for the 27.17m shares to be offered to institutional investors is
being set through a process of book-building. The price for this tranche,
which will be above that offered to individuals, will be set on February 14.
In the case of oversubscription from individual investors, the institutional
allocation can be reduced by up to 20 per cent. Elf employees and former
employees will be offered 6.7m shares.
In addition to the other tranches, 22m shares will be reserved for a core of
long-term stable investors in the group. These are six French industrial and
financial groups - the insurance companies, Axa and Union des Assurances de
Paris, the banks, BNP, Credit Agricole, and Paribas, and Renault, the
state-owned car group.
The sale of most of the state's 51 per cent stake, which values Elf at just
under FFr100bn (Dollars 17bn), is expected to raise about FFr33bn.
Net profits fell last year, from FFr6.2bn in 1992 to FFr1.1bn. But most
industry observers expect the privatisation will be a success, pointing to
the large discount from the current market price and the potential for
improved profits.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BICC to form joint venture in China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the cables and construction group, has signed a letter of intent with
Shanghai Cable Works, one of China's leading cable manufacturers, to form an
equity joint venture.
Shanghai Cable produces a range of power, communication and specialist
cables - including optical fibre cables - and achieved sales of about Pounds
70m n 1993.
The letter of intent envisages that BICC will take 51 per cent of the equity
in the new joint venture.
This will be set up following a feasibility study which is expected to be
completed by the end of May.
In a separate move, Metrotect Industries, the pipeline protection products
maker which went public in June 1993, is setting up a Chinese joint venture
for the purpose of producing coal tar enamel, one of Metrotect's key
products.
Production will be used for anti-corrosion coatings in the fast-growing
Chinese pipeline market.
The Chinese partners are the Pipeline Bureau of Langfang, Hebei province,
part of the China National Petroleum Corporation.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lower costs help Bucknall recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bucknall Group, the loss-making quantity surveyor diversifying into a wider
spread of construction services, continued its recovery in the half year to
October 31 and may reach break-even by the end of the year.
The pre-tax loss was Pounds 226,000, compared with Pounds 745,000 last time
and Pounds 1.33m for the whole of 1992-93. Losses per share narrowed from
5.7p to 2.2p.
The key factors behind the reduced loss were an 18 per cent reduction in the
cost base, reduced interest payments and a rising contribution from
activities like facilities management. Margins remain under pressure.
Turnover increased to Pounds 8.97m (Pounds 8.2m), but was distorted by the
passage through the accounts of consultants' fees in Germany.
Pointing to greater stability in the UK market and improved prospects
internationally, Mr Richard Miles, chairman, noted the widening range of
services the group is selling to the construction industry and said
prospects for improvement are 'better than they have been for some time'.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Worries about family values - NFC's recent
rights issue, which diluted employees' shareholdings, caused some disquiet
at the AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annual meetings of NFC, the transport and logistics group, have always been
distinctive occasions, ever since the former National Freight Consortium was
the subject of an employee buy-out in 1982.
Attended by up to 4,000 people, they have had a unique atmosphere, with
current employees and pensioners keen to monitor the progress of one of the
first nationalised industries to be privatised.
It was, therefore, like eavesdropping on a family row at the weekend to hear
Sir Peter Thompson, who led the original buy-out, accuse his successor, Mr
James Watson, of putting the group's traditional values at risk.
Sir Peter was upset that shareholders were not consulted before NFC's Pounds
263m share issue in December. Following a strategic review, the group plans
to expand its distribution and removal businesses internationally.
However, there was no doubt that Sir Peter's real concern was that NFC's
distinctive culture, based on employee ownership and participation, was in
danger.
The rights issue will accelerate a process of diminishing employee control
which started when NFC was floated in 1989. About 42 per cent of the equity
was in private hands before the December rights issue and 85 per cent of the
group's 32,000 employees are shareholders.
NFC does not yet know how far that proportion of equity held by employees
has fallen as a result of the issue, but it is bound to have been diluted by
institutional cash.
More symbolically, current employees - who had 13 per cent of the shares
before the rights issue - enjoy double voting rights, but only so long as
their total stake is more than 10 per cent.
The rights issue itself will not push the employees' share below this level,
but the steady rate of share sales means that double voting is likely to be
lost sometime this year.
Mr Watson, who succeeded Sir Peter in 1991, insisted that the 'continuing
evolution' of the group posed no threat to its core values. He said the fact
that employees were shareholders was more important than the size of their
stake.
Mr Peter Sherlock, the former Bass director who became chief executive last
February, also insists that NFC's 'enviable heritage and culture' is not in
question - indeed, he says employee participation is a key element in the
group's focus on service, through relaying what customers want.
The end of double voting will make NFC more attractive to investment
institutions which dislike unusual share structures, but Mr Sherlock says of
the provision: 'We have never sought to implement it, or even contemplated
it.'
Mr Sherlock said the main reason for the rights issue was to give NFC some
financial elbow room for its new focus. This involves the merger of the BRS
transport operations and Exel Logistics in the UK, and the international
expansion of both the distribution logistics operations and Allied and
Pickfords, the moving service businesses.
With shareholders' funds of only Pounds 312m supporting a business with
annual turnover of Pounds 1.9bn, NFC had very little room for manoeuvre.
Before the rights issue it had gearing of 53 per cent and even a moderately
sized acquisition would have pushed gearing up to unacceptable levels. The
rights issue has left the group with net cash of Pounds 89m.
Sir Peter did not discuss the merits of the rights issue, saying he was sure
that shareholders would have given their approval to any reasonable case
made by the board. But, he protested: 'We used to pride ourselves on sharing
big decisions with employees and shareholders.'
Mr Watson stoutly defended the board, saying he had flagged the need for a
rights issue to previous shareholder meetings and advance notice of the
rights issue could have undermined the NFC share price.
The AGM at Wembley approved all the resolutions before it and the chairman
was applauded, although not as warmly as Sir Peter. Even board members who
were irritated by the way the former chairman chose to air his complaints
continue to have a high regard for Sir Peter, who in 1990 published a book
on the NFC story, Sharing the Success.
Mr Sherlock believes the rights issue means NFC is entering a third phase,
after the previous landmarks of the 1982 buy-out and 1989 flotation. He
said: 'It is much easier to articulate a philosophy of enhancing shareholder
value if 85 per cent of the employees are shareholders. But we must not let
it act as a restraint on the business, which employees also understand.'
In some ways the rights issue is only the latest in a series of steps which
has taken NFC away from its unusual origins and towards more conventional
corporate practices.
In September the group confirmed it would end its unique tradition of giving
'best view' forecasts of future profits. Developed to keep shareholder
employees informed after the initial buy-out, NFC won special permission
from the Stock Exchange to maintain the practice after flotation because
many employees were not familiar with owning shares.
However, the group was advised that it could face legal challenges in the US
if it failed to meet its best view forecast.
It would be wrong to suggest that NFC is already like any other company. The
group still gives 1 per cent of profits to charities each year and the AGM
enthusiastically applauded a video reporting how the group's charitable
foundation spent Pounds 1.3m last year. It then presented a Pounds 50,000
cheque to the Macmillan Nursing appeal - half raised by employees, the rest
matched by NFC. Some 10,000 retired employees take part in the pensioners'
association, which has 71 branches in the UK.
The rights issue was well received by the City and the shares have since
risen 15 per cent. Analysts welcomed the strategic review and are
enthusiastic about NFC's prospects - as were shareholders at the AGM.
How far NFC can maintain its distinctive culture in the years ahead must
remain an open question. However, no-one who attended the Wembley meeting
could be in any doubt that the issue will be closely followed by the
shareholders - not least Sir Peter.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Legal wrangle over Europa deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal proceedings are being used to stall the proposed three-way merger
between Europa Minerals and two Australian groups with which it is already
associated - Burmine and Austmin Gold - Samuel Montagu, Burmine's adviser,
claimed yesterday.
The claim came after Burmine was successful in discharging an injunction
obtained by Mount Edon Gold, another Australian company, restraining Burmine
from despatching its offers for Europa and Austmin.
Burmine also succeeded in having Mount Edon's action entered on the Western
Australia Supreme Court's 'expedited' list, which should ensure the action
will be heard soon.
Mount Edon obtained the injunction by claiming that the proposed Pounds 15m
offer by Burmine for Europa would be in breach of Australian Corporations
Law and incapable of being implemented in its present form.
Samuel Montagu said the legal proceedings were being used by Mount Edon 'to
promote its own, unsuccessful takeover offer for Burmine'.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bradford &amp; Bingley looks for German market
niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAMBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the UK's seventh largest building society, launched its
assault on the German retail financial services sector yesterday with the
declaration that it was aiming for 5 per cent of the German building society
market.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, B&amp;B's chief executive, said in Hamburg that it was also
planning to open up a full-scale branch office this summer under EU
legislation.
That would allow Mr Bradford and Mr Bingley, the famous bowler-hatted
figures used in the society's UK marketing, to take on the German mortgage
banking market in addition to the Bausparkassen, the German equivalent of
building societies.
Mr Lister said the initial DM13m (Pounds 4.9m) investment was small in
relation to the market potential, and the society would expand cautiously.
In November B&amp;B became the first foreign institution to receive
authorisation from German banking regulators to establish a Bausparkasse.
The new institution - known as B&amp;B Bausparkasse in Europa - plans to take
deposits from next month and will start lending in a few years.
There are currently 34 Bausparkassen which share about 15 per cent of the
highly regulated German home loan market. Mr Lister said that the plan was
to win 1 per cent of the Bausparkasse market - or 50,000 savings contracts -
within a year but that in the medium term five times that level of business
was a realistic target.
B&amp;B selected Germany for expansion abroad after studying market
opportunities throughout continental Europe. The appeal of the German market
lies in the low level of home ownership - 40 per cent as opposed to a
European average of 60 per cent - as well as the perception that the German
mortgage finance sector is underdeveloped by the standards of the highly
competitive UK market.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Brent Walker seeks debt extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cash flow problems at Brent Walker, the property and leisure group which
underwent a financial restructuring in March 1992, have forced it to seek
changes to its loan agreements.
In a circular to holders of its variable rate notes, Brent Walker said
amendments were needed because of the 'continued deterioration in its
balance sheet position' and projected cashflows.
It said net liabilities, Pounds 629.8m at June 30 last year, had risen again
by the year end. The circular warned that all Brent Walker's shares, notes
and warrants were 'extremely speculative' investments.
The group is asking its bankers to extend a Pounds 68.9m working capital
facility, due to expire on March 31 this year, until December 31 1997.
Further, it is seeking to extend the period when it can make interest
payments on its Pounds 827m term loan and its notes in preference shares
rather than cash from the end of 1995 to the end of 1997.
Brent Walker had hoped that by 1996 it would be producing sufficient cash
flow from its pubs and betting shop chains to start paying interest in cash.
Other changes include setting up a Pounds 10m 'solvency support arrangement'
for trade creditors.
Brent Walker said that a majority of the term loan lenders had agreed in
principle to the changes, and it expected to have the amendments completed
by February 28.
A meeting for holders of the notes, which were issued in part exchange for
convertible bonds under the 1992 restructuring, has been called on February
25. The quorum is high at two-thirds of the value of the notes in issue, and
the resolution to approve changes will need a three-quarters majority.
Noteholders include some of Brent Walker's banks; Lonrho, the trading
company; Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging group, and its head Dr
Michael Smurfit.
Brent Walker is keen to finalise the changes before the March 1 deadline for
refinancing the Pounds 350m loan secured on its William Hill betting shop
business.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Baring Venture in US link for media fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baring Venture Partners and Communications Equity Associates, a US provider
of investment banking services to the media industry, have raised a Dollars
65m (Pounds 43.3m) venture capital fund aimed exclusively at unquoted media
and communications companies in Europe.
Baring Communications Equity has taken five months to raise the fund, which
will be invested in 'classic development capital for companies that are
still growing fast.' It will not fund start-ups.
Mr Terrence Tehranian, a partner in BCEL, said the fund would be the biggest
in Europe to invest in the sector.
The number of new licenses being issued, deregulation and the breaking up of
state-wned monopolies made the area particularly attractive.
BCEL will invest in four main areas - cable and satellite television,
terrestrial broadcasting, publishing and telecommunications, with a focus on
the UK, Germany, France and Spain.
Mr Jeff Montgomery, a BCEL partner, said that in the US some Dollars 3.5bn
(Pounds 2.3bn) of private equity was focused on the media and communications
industry; the advertising growth rate in the sector, however, had fallen to
about 1 per cent a year.
In Europe, by contrast, a tenth of that sum was dedicated to media and
communications companies, which were enjoying significant growth.
A number of other venture capital companies have tried without success in
the last three years to raise funds focused on the media.

FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fyffes plans expansion in Europe
and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fyffes, the fresh fruit and vegetable distributor, is planning this year to
diversify out of its UK and Ireland base into continental Europe and the US
to boost sales of bananas. The move is aimed at sustaining earnings growth
into 1995.
The plans were announced yesterday alongside results for the year to October
31 which were better than expected following difficult trading in the
previous 12 months.
On turnover up 17 per cent at IPounds 611.4m (Pounds 593m), compared with
IPounds 524.3m, pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent to IPounds 31.8m (IPounds
28.5m), slightly ahead of market expectations.
The increase largely reflected improved foreign exchange rates with the UK,
which accounts for 60 per cent of group turnover.
Mr David McCann, managing director, said that total banana sales in 1994
were projected to grow to 28m boxes, against 17m in 1993 and 14m in 1992.
The increase was largely a result of new supplies coming on line from a
9,000 acre plantation in Guatemala, which Fyffes was helping to finance.
He said that up to 2m boxes would be sold in the US, a new market which was
opened last November, with most of the remainder going into continental
Europe.
At the end of the period Fyffes had cash of IPounds 92m. Net interest
contributed a lower IPounds 9.61m (IPounds 10.9m) as a result of falling
rates. Interest income is expected to decline further this year to about
IPounds 6m, putting pressure on the company to use its cash for acquisitions
to maintain the momentum of earnings growth.
The company spent IPounds 12m on acquisitions in 1993, and IPounds 20m in
capital expenditure, mainly on improving distribution and ripening
facilities.
Operating profits grew by 25 per cent to IPounds 21.4m (IPounds 17.1m).
However, brokers estimate that to achieve earnings growth of 10 per cent in
1994, operating profits will have to advance by at least IPounds 6m this
year to offset the anticipated fall in interest income.
Earnings per share were 6.1p (5.9p) and a 10 per cent increase in the final
dividend of 0.9876p per share is recommended for a total of 1.378p
(1.2527p).
COMMENT
Fyffes' ambitions in Europe and the US are finally bearing fruit since the
company secured a supply of low-cost Central America 'dollar' bananas after
a five-year struggle. In contrast to Geest, its main UK competitor, Fyffes
has not been affected by Black Sigatoka disease in Central America, nor
seemingly by uncertainties still surrounding the EU banana regime. Since the
regime's introduction in July prices have fluctuated sharply. Fyffes has
indicated it is seeking earnings growth of at least 10 per cent this year,
which would imply a prospective p/e of about 16 on shares up 5p yesterday at
105p. Although a slightly higher rating than Geest's shares, its modesty
reflects Fyffes' vulnerability to further challenges to the EU banana regime
by Latin American producers. Moreover, Fyffes' plans to expand European
sales volumes may come at the expense of profits if oversupply recurrs and
prices weaken again.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bridon faces hefty revamp charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridon, the wire rope and engineering products manufacturer, yesterday
announced a restructuring aimed at streamlining production and expanding
sales overseas.
The move, the culmination of a six-month strategic review at the
Doncaster-based group, is expected to lead to exceptional provisions of up
to Pounds 25m in the year to December 31.
The likely charge - up sharply on restructuring costs of Pounds 1.2m at the
interim stage - sent the shares tumbling 25p early yesterday, although they
later rallied to close up 4p at 160p.
Initial market fears were raised by warnings of redundancies, asset
disposals and the possible closure of at least one of Bridon's 12 factories,
which make products for the construction, mining and offshore exploration
industries.
Mr Ronald Petersen, chief executive, said: 'We will be streamlining the
management structure and anticipate disposals of non-core businesses. There
is also one factory in the system which is surplus to requirements.'
The restructuring, prompted by difficult market conditions and increasingly
competitive pricing by rivals, would also include write-offs of overvalued
assets, he added.
Nevertheless, the group said it expected to 'broadly break even' before
exceptional costs in the second half.
In the six months to June 30, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.1m (Pounds 700,000) on increased turnover of Pounds 112.6m (Pounds 107m).
Mr Petersen, who joined the group last September from Insituform - the US
pipe-lining business, said the review would create new opportunities for
growth.
'Bridon has not made sufficient money over the past four years. It has
remained cash positive only because of careful asset management and tight
cost control.'
The full recommendations of the review will be published on March 24, when a
new management structure would be in place, he added.
Codenamed Project 360, because of its panoramic perspective of the company,
the review is likely to recommend increased emphasis on Bridon's 76 'sling
shop' sites around the world, which convert wire rope into slings for cranes
and construction gantries.
Despite the size of the provision, Mr Petersen was confident that the
restructuring costs would be met from cash flow resources and increased
borrowing.
Gearing is understood to be less than 15 per cent, and the group said its
main lenders had responded positively to the plans.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Girobank integration boosts Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest building society, announced
yesterday that it is to integrate personal customers of its Girobank
subsidiary.
From May the 1.4m personal Girobank customers will be transferred to A&amp;L
although they will still have access to post office facilities and telephone
banking services.
The move will bring to A&amp;L about half of Girobank's balance sheet, including
retail savings expected to amount to about Pounds 1bn.
A&amp;L bought Girobank from the Post Office for Pounds 112m in 1990, and there
has been considerable recent speculation among building societies as to how
the relationship between the two would be resolved.
The move was made possible by the Alliance &amp; Leicester (Girobank) Act 1993.
It will not affect Girobank's corporate banking activities, including the
cash-handling business and transaction processing operations.
Mr Peter White, A&amp;L's chief executive, said the change would enhance the
opportunities for cross-selling financial products to A&amp;L's customers.
He said its strategy was 'relationship- rather than product-driven', and
that customers would benefit as all the personal financial services of the
group were more readily available to them.
The extra liquidity which the transfer will bring to A&amp;L stands it in good
stead as the market for mortgage lending recovers.
It is likely to represent an increase of about 10 per cent in A&amp;L's existing
retail deposits of about Pounds 10bn.
Including Girobank, A&amp;L has about 5.5m personal customers.
Only the relatively small number of Girobank mortgage borrowers will become
A&amp;L shareholders, with the majority of customers, with current and savings
accounts, becoming depositors.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: The importance of being biggest - Andrew
Jack looks behind J Sainsbury's plan to switch auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high street retailer, J Sainsbury, yesterday confirmed that it is
planning to switch auditors from Clark Whitehill to Coopers &amp; Lybrand from
the 1994 financial year.
The announcement sent a frisson of fear around the remaining medium-sized
accountancy firms that audit large quoted companies and who are seeing their
clients captured by their largest 'Big Six' competitors.
The senior partner of one firm said yesterday: 'I have watched this news
with great tension. One is constantly aware that there are fewer and fewer
firms outside the Big Six, and there is more and more marketing to obtain
them.'
For Clark Whitehill, it represents a painful dilution after acting as
accountants to Sainsbury since the turn of the century. According to
published information, audit fees of the group were Pounds 400,000 in 1991
and Pounds 500,000 in both 1992 and 1993. In addition, non-audit fees such
as tax work paid to the auditor were Pounds 800,000 in 1992 and Pounds
700,000 last year.
Most of these fees were paid to Clark Whitehill, which audits all Sainsbury
subsidiaries except Shaw's, its US supermarket chain, which was audited by
Arthur Andersen.
The revenues are a significant proportion of the firm's total fee income,
which last year was Pounds 53m. That compares with billings reported in the
UK by Coopers &amp; Lybrand last year of Pounds 553m. Sainsbury was also Clark
Whitehill's most well-known client, although it retains the audits of about
10 other quoted companies.
Under the proposals to be put to Sainsbury's shareholders at the annual
meeting on July 6, the firm will be superseded by Coopers for the 1995
financial year.
During 1994, it will remain joint auditor to ease the transition. After
then, it will retain some other work, including auditing the pension fund
and acting as a corporate and personal tax adviser.
Sainsbury is believed to have already hived off some non-audit work to other
accountancy firms in the past few years, and to have felt that until now the
audit was a relatively uncontroversial activity since it was satisfied with
its own internal controls and financial management.
But it decided in the past six months that it needed a larger firm of
auditors, and held a competitive tender in which it finally selected Coopers
over KPMG Peat Marwick.
Coopers' bid emphasised its international strength - as the second-largest
network of accountancy firms around the world - as well as its experience in
the retail sector.
Speculation surrounds the reasons for the change. Sainsbury rejected
suggestions that the decision was based on price, although the Coopers audit
fee is not expected to be very different from the existing level.
It denied that the change had anything to do with substantial changes in
accounting policies announced last Friday, when it began to depreciate its
buildings and made a one-off Pounds 365m property write-down.
The company has also rejected speculation that the change has anything to do
with the legal and professional disciplinary action against Clark Whitehill
partners in connection with alleged failure to supervise Mr Nick Young, a
former executive director of the firm's international network who was
convicted for forgery and deception at the Old Bailey three years ago.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement
yesterday that it reflected the need for a firm 'with a wide range of
international experience and a number of other multinational corporate
clients'.
The company added last night that the decision was more to do with the need
for a well-known accountancy name as part of its desire to raise finance
than its own international expansion plans.
It is this image of respectability by the Big Six accountancy firms, the
large law firms and merchant banks, that presents perhaps the greatest
challenge to the middle-sized firms attempting to retain their large
clients.
The importance of name recognition was illustrated by one adviser to a large
company contacted yesterday, who said: 'Clark Whitehead? I've never heard of
them.'
The Big Six are aggressively marketing their technical strengths and
international networks to companies held by their smaller rivals. Their
opponents point to the likelihood of larger firms offering less individual
attention from partners, costly bureaucracies of larger firms as well as to
the writs outstanding suggesting their audits may not be so perfect.
However unjustified, it is clear that the trend to larger auditors is likely
to continue. Just two FT-SE 100 companies are still audited by a firm
outside the Big Six: Pannell Kerr Forster for Williams Holdings and BDO
Binder Hamlyn for Southern Electric.
Both companies said yesterday that they had no plans to change. Mr Nigel
Rudd, chairman of Williams, said: 'Pannell's auditing standards are
excellent and unlike the Big Six firms I am not aware of litigation on their
audit work.'

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: QMH agrees two-month standstill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses and its lenders yesterday agreed on a two-month extension
of its standstill arrangement which expired on Monday.
The group is in talks with bankers over a restructuring of its Pounds 1.3bn
of debt, which it is unable to service.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said the situation was extremely complex
and 'various issues have had to be addressed and continue to be addressed.'
The group was endeavouring to implement the planned financial restructuring
'as soon as practicable.' Satisfactory progress was being made.
The two-month extension appeared to be something of a compromise. QMH had
been believed to be seeking breathing space to the end of April, by which
time it would have finalised its 1993 accounts and have put proposals for
the restructuring to banks, bondholders and shareholders.
The banks appeared to prefer to roll-over the standstill agreement on a
monthly basis.
Extending the arrangement until the end of March should allow QMH to issue
its preliminary figures for 1993, but it would be a tight deadline to
complete the restructuring.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Restructured HSBC offshoot rises to
ADollars 30m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HongkongBank of Australia, the Australian subsidiary of HSBC Holdings,
yesterday reported post-tax profits of ADollars 30m (Pounds 14m) for 1993,
against ADollars 8.1m in 1992.
The bank, which has been restructured over the past three years, raised
operating income to ADollars 143m (ADollars 116.8m) while reducing costs
slightly to ADollars 85.9m (ADollars 86m). Provisions for bad debts rose to
ADollars 25.6m (ADollars 21.3m).
Total assets increased by 9.3 per cent to ADollars 3.2bn. The capital
adequacy ratio rose from 9.4 per cent to 10 per cent.
Assets under custody held by the group securities division were ADollars 1bn
in the first year of operation. The stockbroking arm, James Capel Australia,
returned to profitability.
HSBC Holdings shares closed 26p up at Pounds 10.40p.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bridgeport Machines tools up in east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridgeport Machines is to become one of the first UK machine tool builders
to manufacture in east Asia following the signing of a memorandum of
understanding to create a joint venture in Indonesia.
The Leicester-based company, in conjunction with its US parent, is forming a
new company with Indonesia's PT Texmaco Perkasa Engineering, which makes
textile machinery, and Megatech, an investment company.
Bridgeport Perkasa Machine Tools will make a range of machines from the
manually-operated Bridgeport turret mill to computer-controlled machining
centres for the fast-growing Indonesian, Asean and Australasian markets.
Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport Machines, said the
company already had a good market in east Asia but would not say how much he
expected to increase sales in the region following the deal.
The deal was important, however, as it would enable the company to build
machines closer to customers, giving it an advantage in a highly-competitive
market.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Algerian oil and gas discovery for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday
announced a discovery in Algeria.
The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US, Lasmo's partner in the
venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at 4,900 barrels of oil a
day and 6.3m cu ft of natural gas.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the partners were considering an early
appraisal of the find. 'The prospects for a commercial discovery are quite
good,' he said.
Last year Lasmo and its partners announced an oil and gas find south of the
latest discovery. Two more exploration wells are to be drilled in the area,
which is in a relatively remote area south-east of the town of Hassi
Messaoud. The discovery is about 50km from the nearest pipeline.
Oil operations in the region have so far been untouched by the political
violence directed against foreigners in Algiers, although American drilling
crews are flown to the site directly from Texas.
The new Algerian discovery follows an announcement last month that Lasmo's
gas reserves off Indonesia, one of its biggest assets, had been upgraded by
13 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fidelity launches new smaller Japanese
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidelity Investments is launching an investment trust specialising in
smaller Japanese companies.
Mr Simon Fraser, manager of Fidelity Japanese Values, said he believed such
companies were poised to benefit from a cyclical recovery, as well as
deregulation and other structural changes in the Japanese economy.
Fidelity already has a unit trust covering this area but is hoping to
attract more institutional investors with the investment trust structure.
The minimum size of the fund will be about Pounds 25m, but Fidelity expects
demand to be greater than that.
The public offer period will run from February 22 to March 8 and dealings
are due to start on March 15. Ordinary shares will be priced at 100p, with
one warrant attached to every five shares, and issue expenses capped at 4.5
per cent.
The trust will be between 20 and 25 per cent geared from the outset, using
equity index-linked loan stock, tied to the FT-A Japan Index.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shows decline to Pounds 1.23m in
first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and
engineering services group, fell by 67 per cent from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds
1.23m in the three months to December 31 1993.
The fall, which had been flagged in a warning last month, reflected a sharp
drop in profits at the company's US engineering and environmental services
business.
For the year to last September there was a 39 per cent drop in profits to
Pounds 8.79m.
Turnover, net of subcontract costs, was 5 per cent lower at Pounds 38.1m
(Pounds 40.1m).
US turnover (50 per cent of the total) fell by 12 per cent in dollar terms
as demand for environmental services fell well below the company's
expectations.
Operating profits in the US were also affected by a large increase in
contingency provisions and fell from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 370,000.
The Life Sciences group in the UK saw turnover fall from Pounds 9.86m to
Pounds 9.56m and operating profits decline to Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 2.14m) as
a result of delays in project start-ups and the effects of a staff flu
epidemic on volumes.
Mr Bernie Wooley, chief executive, said that despite the setback the company
intended to maintain its capital investment programme and remained confident
in the long-term operating potential.
Earnings per share fell from 2.9p to 1p.
The shares were unchanged at 114p.

FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ferranti wins RN contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferranti International, the electronics company in administrative
receivership since December, has won a preliminary contract to equip two new
assault ships for the Royal Navy.
The contract, although worth only about Pounds 200,000 for the final
'project definition' phase, provides an important boost for Ferranti's naval
command and control business, one of its key remaining defence activities.
It has beaten competition from GEC-Marconi and BAeSema, the joint venture
between British Aerospace and the Sema systems company which in recent years
has ousted Ferranti from a near-monopoly in UK naval command systems.
Both BAe and GEC-Marconi are among companies short-listed as possible
purchasers of the bulk of Ferranti's businesses.
Joint receivers Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen,
described the contract as 'very significant' in demonstrating the company's
long-term potential.
They were optimistic that formal purchase negotiations for Ferranti could
start in March.
About eight companies, also including Thorn EMI and Thomson-CSF of France,
are expected to be asked to submit 'indicative' bids by the end of this
month.
Ferranti won a contract last autumn for a similar system for the navy's new
helicopter carrier. The first of the two planned assault ships is due to be
ordered by the end of next year.

FT  03 FEB 94 / A bubble borne along on a wave of money: Stephen Fidler
examines the forces driving cash into emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a stock market rallies by about 10 per cent in a day - as Brazil's did
on Tuesday - something other than a calm reassessment of that market's
quoted companies is under way.
Brazil's market - and others across Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe -
is rising on the weight of money flowing from New York and other big
financial centres. Almost Dollars 40bn went into stock markets outside the
industrialised world last year.
Mr Michael Howell, equity strategist at Baring Securities in London,
calculates that Dollars 160bn (Pounds 107bn) of emerging market shares were
held by foreigners at the end of 1993; seven years earlier, the figure was
Dollars 2.4bn. Since 1988, emerging market share prices have doubled. Last
year, annual returns to investors were an average 67 per cent.
Unsurprisingly, some investors are starting to worry that this is a bubble
which may soon burst.
Mr Howell argues that changes in the global economy over the last 10 years
make the flows into new markets durable.
The free flow of capital around the world, economic reform in developing
economies and a jump in the US savings rate as baby-boomers get older are
driving the change in investment patterns. At the same time, returns on
investments in industrialised countries have fallen.
But not everyone agrees. Mr Roger Nightingale, a London-based economic
consultant, says the big shift of funds into emerging markets is 'definitely
temporary'. He argues that the bubbly markets are driven by one thing:
Japan's relaxed monetary policy which has created huge outflows of capital.
That policy is a response to government fears about unemployment. Once
capital outflows from Japan slow - when monetary policy tightens as the
unemployment problem recedes - the emerging markets will crack, he says.
Capital outflows from Japan last year probably reached Dollars 200bn. This
balanced a current account surplus of around Dollars 137bn and inflows of
capital from foreigners repaying loans to Japanese banks. According to Mr
Nightingale, the Japanese government has placed that money abroad, mainly in
US Treasury bills. This has helped keep US interest rates low and has driven
US investors out of low-yielding money market funds into equity funds - and
the new markets.
US mutual funds showed record inflows last year of about Dollars 130bn, of
which almost 30 per cent went into international funds. According to
preliminary figures from Lipper Analytical Services, net sales of emerging
market mutual funds investing in equities reached Dollars 20.7bn.
This underestimates total mutual fund investment in emerging markets, since
it excludes fixed-income funds typically accounting for a fifth of the
equity total, equity funds launched in the fourth quarter, and investment in
developing country stocks by general equity and global equity funds.
According to Lipper's Mr William McBride, the total assets of emerging funds
now amount to around Dollars 100bn.
Most of this money (at least 90 per cent of 1993 net sales) is in open-ended
funds. This could cause severe volatility in the emerging markets: as
investors sell their mutual fund shares, fund managers are forced to
liquidate their underlying shares. In the face of heavy sales, the
questionable liquidity of many emerging markets would be put to the test.
'I wouldn't want the job of trying to sell Dollars 50m of stock for cash in,
say, the Indonesian market,' said Mr McBride. Turnover in the Jakarta market
averaged Dollars 33m a day last year.
Since a large proportion of this mutual fund investment is from small
investors in the US who have been switching out of low-yielding money market
funds, the most likely trigger for such a shift would be a sharp rise in US
interest rates.
Most economists believe some increase in US rates is likely this year. If
this rise is modest, US rates will still be at historically lows levels and
a substantial flow of funds into mutual funds could be expected to continue.
Mr Roger Palmer, of Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, says that even if
interest rates turned high enough to tempt mutual funds investors back into
money markets, bank deposits and the like, the growing interest of pension
funds and insurance companies should help sustain a continued flow of
finance into the emerging markets.
Mr Anthony Bottrill, deputy managing director of the Washington-based
Institute for International Finance, a think-tank owned by international
banks, says: 'We are seeing the beginnings of a large portfolio shift that
can last 10-15 years.'
The movement into emerging markets has been underpinned not only by their
good performance, but also by the idea that diversification can reduce
overall risk in a portfolio.
The problem is that the more institutional investors pile into the emerging
markets, the more their investment decisions dominate those markets,
reducing the diversification benefits.
The behaviour of such longer-term investors may not in any case be enough to
sustain performance in emerging markets. The evidence of the 1987 stock
market crash was that, in times of trouble, investors retreat to the markets
they know best.
In other words, the performance of emerging markets remains hostage to what
goes on in the industrialised world. Investors should make sure they know
what is happening to US interest rates - or even to Japanese unemployment.

FT  03 FEB 94 / News Corp investors upset over Doulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of exchangeable preference shares issued by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation fear they may incur a considerable financial loss because of a
legal wrangle over the ownership of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china
manufacturer.
When Pearson, the media, banking and industrial group which publishes the
Financial Times, demerged Royal Doulton last year, it offered its
shareholders one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held in the parent.
Since News Corp's preference shares were exchangeable into shares which the
company had bought in Pearson in the late 1980s, the holders anticipated
that when they exercised their exchange right they would receive Royal
Doulton shares in addition to shares in Pearson.
Indeed, a notice published on behalf of a subsidiary of News Corp in the FT
on December 13 advised holders of the preference shares that they were
entitled to the Royal Doulton shares as part of the exchange property.
As a result, many holders decided to exchange and traders adjusted the price
of the preference shares to reflect the value of the Royal Doulton shares.
However, the market was thrown into confusion this week by a notice in
Monday's FT which said that News Corp was taking legal advice over whether
the Royal Doulton shares were part of the exchange property after all. News
Corp has declined to elaborate on the notice.
The notice has serious financial implications for traders and investors who
have made sales of Royal Doulton shares in the belief that they would
receive them as part of the exchange property. They also face foreign
exchange losses if they have to unwind their hedging positions.
Traders said News Corp's efforts to improve its relationship with investors
would be dealt a serious blow if it kept the Royal Doulton shares. 'The
market will put News Corp through the works just when it is trying to
improve its name,' said one dealer.
In 1989, News Corp raised the equivalent of Dollars 375m (using current
exchange rates) in sterling, guilders and D-Marks through issuing preference
shares which were exchangeable for shares in Pearson. In the late 1980s,
News Corp's stake in Pearson reached 20.5 per cent but it has subsequently
been cut to 4.9 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Euro Disney pushed further into the red by falling sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group, yesterday revealed a further slide
into the red with a net first-quarter loss of FFr553m (Pounds 62m) against a
FFr423m deficit in the same period last year.
The loss for the three months to December 31 was announced as Euro Disney's
60 creditor banks were starting a special meeting in Paris to plan their
tactics for negotiating the group's emergency financial restructuring.
At the meeting the banks discussed a preliminary report on Euro Disney's
financial position compiled by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
KPMG had been unable to complete its full report in time for the meeting,
claiming that Walt Disney, the US group that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, had refused to release sufficient information. The banks plan to
meet again when the full report is available. It is scheduled for completion
in two weeks' time.
The banks have been asked to give a mandate to a steering committee, led by
Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, to start the negotiations.
The steering committee is expected to press Walt Disney to extend the
deadline for negotiations from the original date of March 31 because of the
delay in completing the KPMG report.
Walt Disney has already tabled proposals to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
net debt through a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. The banks are keen
to ensure that it plays a larger part in the restructuring, notably by
reducing its entitlement to royalties from Euro Disney.
Euro Disney said that it had maintained operating profits in the first
quarter but suffered a 12 per cent fall in sales to FFr828m from FFr944m.
The group has been offering discounted entrance to the EuroDisneyland theme
park and cutting some hotel rates in an attempt to boost attendance during
the slack winter season.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Siebe calls end to 'dinosaur war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace has broken out in the 'dinosaur war' - a bitter and abusive struggle
for market share between two of the world's leading suppliers of advanced
process control systems.
A settlement has been agreed between Honeywell, the US giant which dominates
the world market, and Foxboro, the Massachusetts-based subsidiary of Siebe,
the UK engineering group.
Under the agreement, Foxboro will tell its sales force to stop a 'dinosaur
advertising campaign' and related promotional activities, which - without
naming Honeywell - claimed that competitive products were obsolete.
Honeywell will tell its sales force not to distribute to customers sales
training material directed at Foxboro and not to make statements which
criticise its competitor.
An agreed statement said: 'Both parties intend to vigorously compete in
future by concentrating on promoting the advantages of their own companies
and products.'
If hostilities have indeed ceased, it will be a novel working situation for
sales staff and executives in both groups. When the UK group bought Foxboro
for Dollars 656m (Pounds 437m) in 1990, the then chairman and chief
executive of the US company was quoted as saying Siebe intended to 'bury'
Honeywell.
Mr Barrie Stephens, the chairman and forceful founder of the modern Siebe,
once startled a meeting of analysts by saying: 'I see the chairman of
Honeywell mentioned us twice in his last statement. We must be getting the
son of a bitch worried.'
Mr Allen Yurko, who took over as chief executive from Mr Stephens at the
beginning of the year, said he was very pleased with the settlement of the
legal action, which was launched by Foxboro. 'It resolves the issue and gets
us all back to the promotion of our own products.'
Competition is fiercest at the top end of the process control market, where
automation systems are used to control everything from oil refineries to
food processing plants.
Foxboro yesterday said it had won a batch of international contracts worth
more than Pounds 36m in recent months. Four of the largest contracts - each
worth more than Pounds 5m - are for the group's Intelligent/Automation (I/A)
Series, which Mr Yurko said was a technological leader. One of the largest
orders is from the Chiyoda Corporation of Japan, for a liquefied natural gas
plant in the Gulf state of Qatar.
Another is the modernisation of the Kuwait National Petroleum Company's Mina
Al Ahmadi refinery, the first major modernisation project undertaken by KNPC
since the Gulf War.
Mr Yurko said this confirmed there was a vibrant market for process control
updates in the Middle East. Other large orders were in Thailand and
Argentina.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Honda considers keeping Rover link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first tentative signs emerged yesterday that Honda is not considering
quickly severing its ties with Rover in the wake of BMW's planned takeover
of the British carmaker. This came as a Honda vice-president, who sits on
Rover's board, began talks in the UK on Honda's options.
Officials at Honda Motor Europe's headquarters in Reading began to distance
Rover from the actions of its parent, British Aerospace, which announced the
Pounds 800m sale to BMW on Monday. 'Why should we be angry with Rover; it
was a BAe decision to sell to BMW,' said Mr Chris Rogers, HME's spokesman.
Mr Yoshihide Munekuni, Honda's director on the Rover board, arrived
yesterday for talks with HME's president, Mr Shojiro Miyake. Mr Munekuni was
expected also to meet BAe officials. It is believed that he was keen to
review the situation with Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman and BAe's
deputy chief executive.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, has made it clear that he hopes
Honda will maintain its alliance with Rover. He plans to go to Tokyo next
week to meet Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's chief executive. Publicly, Honda
in Tokyo has been cool towards the prospect of such talks.
However, HME officials accept that a dialogue with BMW must be opened. 'We
will have to talk. There was a great deal of disappointment and genuine
shock that our trust in what has been a very long-term partnership should
appear misplaced. But now we have to start deciding on our European strategy
options,' said Mr Rogers.
Honda said yesterday: 'We are still shell-shocked and it is far too early'
to discuss the future of most of the projects between Honda and Rover.
However, Mr Miyake confirmed that one, at least, would not be affected - the
sale of Land Rover's Discovery model through Honda's sales networks in
Japan, badged as the Honda Crossroads. The agreement runs for three years.
Honda's dismay at the way the deal was done is shared by many inside Rover.
While recognising that BMW had much to recommend it, Rover managers
privately expressed anger at the treatment administered to Honda. 'We have
worked closely with Honda colleagues for 15 years and we have built up both
liking and a deep mutual respect,' said one.
Some industry analysts have predicted that Honda will at least allow
existing and planned collaborations to run their course.

FT  03 FEB 94 / North-east's last working pit may close within weeks:
British Coal likely to begin review procedure for Ellington colliery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal is likely today to start the process that will result in the
closure of its last working colliery in the north-east of England, once
considered the heart of the industry.
The move will shock the workforce at Ellington colliery, Northumberland,
which was confident the pit's future was secure after it recently won
lucrative contracts to supply a nearby Alcan aluminium smelter.
Regional executives are expected to tell union leaders representing more
than 1,000 workers at the pit that they want to hold a review meeting soon.
This could mean rationalisation, but is more likely to lead to closure
within the next few weeks.
As part of its pre-privatisation rationalisation, British Coal yesterday
signalled the closure of its Manton pit in Nottinghamshire by calling a
meeting to review its future. Other Nottinghamshire pits will be told their
fate today.
The north-east will react angrily to the developments at Ellington. In the
industry's heyday at the turn of the century, the region boasted hundreds of
pits. For more than a century the region has been host to the Durham Miners'
Gala, the most celebrated of the industry's annual gatherings.
The expression - 'Sending coals to Newcastle' - was coined because the
region had such plentiful supplies of the mineral it would never need to
import it. Although the resource remains plentiful, it is difficult to
supply it to customers at competitive prices.
British Coal recently told regional representatives, including MPs and
council leaders, there were severe geological problems at Ellington. Seams
were thin and the pit had lost Pounds 6m in the previous nine months.
Mr Jack Thompson, MP for Wansbeck constituency and a former worker at the
pit, said he was not optimistic about today's meeting, but he hoped the
private sector would show interest in the pit.
Most of Ellington's employees at the pit had believed its short-term future
was secure because of the Alcan contracts.
Alcan last week announced it had joined forces with Ryan, the mining group,
to consider a bid to buy British Coal's operations in the north-east,
including Ellington and open-cast mines. Today's announcement should not
affect Ryan and Alcan's ability to mine at Ellington.
British Coal has said it will keep all pits it closes in a state where they
can be re-opened by private operators. Ellington is still likely to be
offered in the north-east regional package which forms one of five companies
to be sold by the government in the forthcoming privatisation.
Separately the government yesterday announced offers of coal subsidies to
RJB Mining in support of additional sales from Blenkinsopp drift mine in
Northumberland to National Power, and to Monktonhall Mineworkers in support
of additional sales to Scottish Power.

FT  03 FEB 94 / VW poaching of GM staff did not break rules, court declares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Frankfurt civil court yesterday rejected claims that Volkswagen broke
competition rules in poaching seven managers from the General Motors group
and trying to lure away a further 22 last spring.
VW greeted the judgment as a crucial victory in its long-running dispute
with GM over the recruitment of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the US
group's former global purchasing chief, and his associates who followed him
to VW.
Criminal investigations in Germany and the US relating to suspected
industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud are still in progress.
However, the court said in a written statement that it was a matter for
debate whether allegations of the theft of GM secrets were justifiable.
Mr Jurgen Kicker, the lawyer representing Volkswagen, said the ruling
exonerated Mr Lopez and the German group from all suspicions against them.
'It confirms what we have always said: that no one has stolen any trade
secrets and no one has used any.' He said he did not think the current
criminal investigations would come to any other conclusion than that reached
yesterday.
Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, VW group spokesman, said: 'It was a very clear
victory. The state prosecutors will have to think twice now before bringing
any charges.'
But a spokesman for Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of VW's supervisory board, who
is responsible for the board's conduct, stressed that the ruling resolved
only the issue of anti-competitive staff poaching. Unlike Mr Ferdinand
Piech, VW chairman, Mr Liesen has consistently refused to give Mr Lopez or
his followers unconditional support.
Officials at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, stressed that the evidence
available to the Frankfurt court was more limited than that gathered by
public prosecutors - it included only information from GM's files.
Evidence and statements gathered by the prosecutors since then were not
examined by the Frankfurt civil court, they said.
VW has admitted that some of Mr Lopez's team were involved in shredding
'possibly sensitive' material last March in the group's Wolfsburg guest
house. Prosecutors, who have also investigated at least two further
instances in which material has been destroyed, are examining a computerised
data seized during a raid on VW headquarters and employees' homes last
August.
A court statement said it had not ignored the 'unusual' circumstances in
which all seven suddenly left and were almost immediately installed in new
jobs at VW, but its decision was based on the former GM employees' evidence
that they had approached Mr Lopez voluntarily.
Opel officials said yesterday's judgment was a sideshow to the main event.
The company regretted the decision, and would examine the ruling before it
decided whether to appeal.

FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney's first-quarter results offer few rays of sunshine for
shareholders. The theme park's net loss climbed to FFr553m. And although
Euro Disney has chopped costs, price-cutting has not yet pulled enough
visitors through the Magic Kingdom's doors to prevent revenues falling 12
per cent. The auditors' report commissioned by lending banks seems unlikely
to apportion any blame. So lenders will have to devise their own approach to
dealing with Euro Disney's FFr20bn of debt. Some banks have already lost
patience and are selling well below par. The growing restiveness among
holders of Euro Disney's FFr4bn convertible bonds creates another
complication.
Only the suspension of disbelief appears to be sustaining Euro Disney's
shares. If Walt Disney's posturing is to be believed, there remains a threat
that France's 'cultural Chernobyl' could melt down. At best, shareholders
can expect massive dilution. The mooted FFr5bn rights issue would probably
require a doubling of the shares in issue. A debt-for-equity swap would
further dilute the shares. The slender hope is that the banks will knock
down any longer-term benefits accruing to Walt Disney through royalties and
management fees. That may leave sufficient recovery appeal for shareholders
to take up their rights. Alternatively, the banks may choose to underwrite
an unattractive rights issue to swap their debt into shares.

FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paramount's immaculately timed profits warning should help focus the minds
of investors now that the final takeover bids are in. Whatever the
longer-term visions of Viacom and QVC, Paramount's short-term prospects fall
well short of the mountainous price either seem prepared to pay. Paramount's
shortage of hits continues, with Addams Family Values and the Major Dad
television show failing to capture the imagination. The market's view was
made clear from the strong rally in QVC shares once investors decided its
bid was inferior.
Since cash will attract the arbitrageurs, it was curious that QVC chose to
increase the cash element of its offer from Dollars 92 a share to Dollars
104, rather than matching Viacom's Dollars 107. Perhaps it was stretched,
though it seems more likely that it is relying on the paper element of its
bid to be decisive. That could be a mistake, as Viacom offers some
guarantees for the value of the paper portion of its bid.
However, even these 'final' bids may not be final, since the fiduciary duty
of Paramount's directors could force them to consider further offers. And
with the bids so finely balanced, neither QVC nor Viacom may have a majority
of the shares by the deadline. If that happens the five-month saga will drag
on. Perhaps then even litigious US investors may look fondly at the
two-month sprint of the UK takeover system. UK shareholders, meanwhile,
might wish that their informal code put the same pressure on companies to
maximise shareholder value that the fear of the courts inspires in US
directors.

After the acrimonious end to their merger plans, it was probably too much to
expect Renault and Volvo to maintain the connections established during
their courtship. The more ambitious collaboration schemes have already been
abandoned. Renault's partial sale of its stake in Volvo begins the severance
of financial ties as well. It is not yet clear how far this process will go.
Disposal of its stakes in Volvo Car and Volvo Truck will be complicated. So
will Volvo's disposal of its 20 per cent stake in Renault. Once the
disentanglement has started, however, it makes sense, particularly for
Volvo, to see it through.
Volvo's shares have risen sharply on relief that its recovery prospects will
not be diluted by union with a Renault bogged down by the continental
European automotive cycle. Volvo's main markets in Sweden, the UK and US are
growing. With the benefit of the krona devaluation and its own cost-cutting,
it can look forward to profits that do not make yesterday's close of SKr692
look expensive.
The shares have also been driven by the view that a policy of focusing on
its basic automotive business will enable Volvo to dispose of activities
into which it has diversified. For now, that may obviate the need for a
rights issue. Volvo, though, does not have the resources to soldier on alone
indefinitely. If Renault is not to be its automotive partner, it needs a
clean slate to find another one. Opponents of the merger used to cite BMW as
an example of a thriving independent car company with a limited model range.
In buying Rover, even BMW seems to be admitting that scale is important.

FT  03 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Buying Europe's silver
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since privatisation issues have been a bonanza for many British investors,
it is not surprising they are rushing to jump on the European bandwagon. The
level of subscriptions to the privatisation trusts launched by Kleinwort
Benson and Mercury Asset Management also reflects small investor frustration
at the low return on cash and the difficulty, which evidently also besets
large institutions, of securing an allocation of foreign issues as they come
to market.
Doubtless European governments will have to offer attractive prices to get
their sales away. Even Pounds 1bn of UK investment trust money pales almost
into insignificance beside anticipated sales of up to Pounds 100bn. But the
new trusts will not be able to make huge returns by cashing in on the new
issue discount in every case, and they may not even try when the allocation
process is so uncertain. Their approach is based much more on evidence that
privatisation issues tend to outperform for some years as efficiency gains
are realised. It thus makes sense for trust managers to buy outside the
immediate sale.
That, though, raises the question of stock selection. UK investors who
focused on British Steel, Rolls-Royce, and, until recently, British
Aerospace, will not have enjoyed outstanding returns from privatisation.
There will be dogs elsewhere in Europe too. Nor, given restrictive
continental labour laws, may efficiency gains come through as quickly as in
Britain. While attractive, these trusts are not a one-way bet. The point may
be worth remembering if, as seems likely, they move immediately to a
premium.

Is this a case for Sweden's consumer ombudsman? The most prestigious of the
country's banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, which just a year ago was on
the verge of having to call on the state to rescue it, is running full-page
advertisements in the Swedish newspapers urging the public to buy its own

'Bonds,' runs the text, 'are the safest way there is of investing your

Skandinaviska's bosses should know that an investment in corporate bonds is
only as safe as the company which issues the bonds.

<TEXT>
The BBC World Service, which has probably reported more revolutions than
anybody, seems on the brink of one of its own. Sam Younger, 42, has been
given the new job of director of broadcasting. Moreover, the World Service
is about to be split into six regions, replacing the current divide between
those who speak English and those who don't.
The intention is to make the service more user-friendly. Maybe fans will no
longer have to tune in at 3 am to catch a favourite programme. Even so, some
old World Service hands see the idea of giving listeners what they want,
when they want it, as a bit too commercially minded.
Younger - who will be effective number two to BBC World Service managing
director Bob Phillis - should be able to handle any flak. It runs in the
family: his father was a former Labour MP and big wheel in Chatham House
while his cousin, Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Lord Younger, is a former
Tory cabinet minister.

When you make a television documentary about the Royal Marines, the language
is likely to be on the strong side. Westcountry's series - Commando - was
larded with expletives, but since it was originally shown at 10.40 pm on
regional TV, it easily passed muster. The problem comes when sensitive
programmes are broadcast before the witching hour - 9 pm - when children are
deemed to be asleep.
The ITV network now plans to show Commando nationwide, starting on February
17. But in order to put it out at peak family time - 8.30 pm - Westcountry
had to cut the blasphemies and substitute bleeps and baas; so many of them
were required that the commandos sound like little lambs.
Now ITV has unexpectedly rescheduled the series to 9.30 pm, when military
bluntness is once again acceptable. So will our brave boys see their own
rich dialogue restored? This calls for strategic planning . .

Now we have as his successor the Right Reverend Michael Turnbull, who says
he believes in the resurrection and Virgin Birth but not the Three Wise Men.
He's also not sure about eternal damnation. Presumably he will wait and see.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-Term Capital Management, the new high-tech US money management firm led
by ex-Salomon bond trading chief John Meriwether, has bagged a big fish in
David Mullins, the Federal Reserve's vice-chairman.
LTCM is currently trying to raise several billion dollars from investors to
start trading complex financial instruments, using fancy computer-driven
arbitrage strategies. At LTCM, Mullins will be working with a team of
ex-Salomon mathematical geniuses, who earned vast salaries during the late
1980s and early 1990s, while generating huge profits for their employer.
Vastness of salary is believed to be one of LTCM's attractions for Mullins;
he clearly needs a raise after surviving on his meagre Dollars 123,100 Fed
annual salary.
The Mullins recruitment has nevertheless raised some Wall Street eyebrows.
The reason is that Meriwether was one of the top managers at Salomon forced
to resign in 1991 for failing immediately to report to the authorities that
they knew their traders had been falsifying bids in billion-dollar Treasury
bond auctions. Among those authorities not informed was the Fed - where
Mullins was already working.
Maybe Mullins has jumped prematurely - LTCM has yet to open for business.
It's hoping to have raised its first Dollars 1bn package by the end of
February provided that it can reassure potential investors that it can
justify its reportedly generous fees.

FT  03 FEB 94 / 'Twere well it were done quickly: A timely increase in US
interest rates could safeguard long-term economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has put the world on
notice. It is no longer a question of whether US short-term interest rates
are going up, but when.
By referring on Monday to current rates as 'abnormally low' and by talking
of the need to move to a 'more neutral stance', he may appear to have left
his options open. But for Mr Greenspan, a master of opaque language, this
was clarity itself. In congressional testimony this week he was sending the
White House and financial markets an unmistakable signal. For the first time
in five years, the direction of US monetary policy is changing: the Fed, the
US central bank, is preparing the ground for an increase in short-term
interest rates.
The discount rate was last raised - from 6.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent - in
February 1989. The key federal funds rate - the rate at which banks borrow
from each other - peaked at just under 10 per cent in March 1989. By the
late summer of 1990, when the economy slipped into recession, the fed funds
rates had been cut to just over 8 per cent.
The following two years saw a sharp decline in the cost of money, with the
discount rate - the largely-symbolic rate at which banks can borrow from the
Fed - and the fed funds rate falling to 3 per cent by September 1992.
Official rates have not moved since - the longest period of stability for 30
years.
But nothing lasts for ever. This April will mark the third anniversary of
the end of what was, in retrospect, a mild recession. The economy is now
growing strongly. In the fourth quarter of last year real gross domestic
product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent. Nobody expects that
supercharged rate of expansion to be sustained.
Indeed, in the short run, the Los Angeles earthquake and exceptionally cold
weather last month may artificially depress spending and production. More
relevant to the Fed is that the annual rate of growth has averaged nearly
3.5 per cent for two years. And far from slackening, the recovery still
appears to be gaining momentum as the benign effects of lower long-term
interest rates spread through the economy.
But why should the Fed regard robust growth, in itself, as a pretext for
raising short-term interest rates? Isn't President Bill Clinton right to
argue that, since inflationary pressures are subdued, there is no need to
tighten monetary policy and risk choking off the recovery?
The Fed concedes that inflation to date has been well behaved. The 'core'
consumer price index (which excludes volatile components such as food and
energy) was up only 3.1 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1992 and
1993, the lowest annual increase since the early 1970s. The fixed-weight GDP
deflator (a broader and probably more accurate guide to underlying
inflation) rose at an annual rate of just over 2 per cent in the second half
of last year. Unit labour costs are also rising at about this rate,
reflecting the positive impact of unusually strong productivity growth.
But Mr Greenspan does not regard the current inflation rate as an
appropriate guide to monetary policy for two reasons. First, interest rates
were cut to the unusually low level of 3 per cent - effectively zero in real
terms - for a specific reason: to ease enormous strains on the balance
sheets of banks, companies and households following an unsustainable
build-up of debt in the late 1980s and a subsequent weakening of real estate
prices. For a couple of years, the financial health of the US banking system
was in the balance.
Today, US banks are highly profitable, having restored their capital ratios
to prudent levels. Companies and households have reduced their debt burdens
and are borrowing again. It is difficult to argue that the monetary
accommodation essential during the 'credit crunch' is still appropriate.
Mr Greenspan's second argument for higher rates is that inflation is a
lagging indicator. He told Congress: 'By the time inflation pressures are
evident, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have already developed,
and only harsh monetary therapy can restore the financial stability
necessary to sustain growth. This situation regrettably has arisen too often
in the past.' In other words, the Fed wants to stay ahead of the game.
Mr Clinton's observation that inflation is not now a problem is thus beside
the point. Since changes in monetary policy take effect over a period of
12-18 months, the Fed has to consider the outlook for inflation in the
second half of next year. If growth continues for another 18 months at the
3.5 per cent level registered in the past two years, capacity constraints
probably will be biting by then, causing quite strong upward pressure on US
domestic prices and wages, regardless of what is happening in the rest of
the world.
This could be so even if corporate restructuring has raised the US's
long-term potential rate of growth. Conventional estimates suggest the
potential growth rate is 2.0-2.5 per cent. This may be too pessimistic, but
no credible forecaster believes it is more than 3 per cent. Excess capacity
is thus disappearing.
If the Fed does tighten policy, it will not be trying to choke off recovery
but rather to safeguard what many observers (including Mr Greenspan)
describe as the most promising long-term economic outlook in two or three
decades. The US is enjoying a spontaneous business-led recovery. Because the
federal budget deficit was so large at the end of the 1980s, fiscal
reflation was not an option for either the Bush or Clinton administrations.
Private capital formation rather than government purchases or consumer
spending is thus at the cutting edge of this recovery. Last year business
fixed investment rose 15 per cent in real terms - and it was not all
computers. Excluding computers, business investment rose 8 per cent in real
terms. Since the end of the recession, investment has contributed a larger
share of economic growth than in any upturn in the past 30 years. The
restoration of 'animal spirits' reflects the decline in long-term interest
rates which in turn reflects the drop in inflation expectations since the
late 1980s, supported by the Clinton administration's efforts to cut the
federal deficit.
The still imponderable question is how soon and how aggressively the Fed
will raise rates. One view is that Mr Greenspan would not have sent so clear
a signal if the Fed were not planning early action, perhaps soon after the
meeting today and tomorrow of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's
policymaking body.
But the consensus view on Wall Street is that the Fed will not act until
March or April. Long-time observers of the bond market, such as Mr Henry
Kaufman, believe Mr Greenspan lacks an immediate justification for action
and is in only the early stages of a process of 'conditioning' US
politicians to the need for higher rates. On this view the Fed will issue
several further warnings and quite possibly delay action until well into the
second quarter.
Since the risk of a surge in inflation is slight, it seems safe to assume
that any increase in rates will be gradual. Mr Greenspan was a 'gradualist'
during the recession, favouring quarter- or half-point cuts in rates. He is
likely to favour the same strategy on the way up. And his influence on
timing may be enhanced by the vacuum created by the unexpected resignation
this week of Mr David Mullins, the Fed vice-chairman. There are now two
vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board and Mr Clinton is notoriously slow
in making appointments.
The timetable of rate increases, of course, will depend on trends in
inflation and in the real economy. But a reasonable expectation is that
short-term rates will rise to 4 per cent by the end of this year and 5 per
cent by the end of 1995.
One prediction seems safe. The sooner the Fed acts, the smaller will be the
overall increase in interest rates in this economic cycle. This is because
early action would nip inflationary pressures in the bud. If action is
timely, the impact on long-term rates and hence on business investment will
be modest. And the healthy expansion now under way could then be sustained
for several more years.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A better deal for car buyers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few issues excite fiercer controversy between European consumers and
producers than the workings of the new car market. This month, battle will
be renewed when the European Commission considers whether the motor
industry's distribution arrangements should continue to be exempted from EU
competition rules.
The current nine-year-old system, due to expire next year, grants carmakers
a degree of control over distribution which would be illegal in other
industries. They are free to decide which dealers they supply, the sales
territories they serve and the number of cars they sell, and to prohibit
them from stocking rival brands.
Car manufacturers want the system extended and appear to have the support of
Mr Martin Bangemann, the European industry commissioner. They argue that the
arrangements are necessary to persuade dealers to invest in sales promotion
and in the facilities needed to provide reliable after-sales service and
maintenance.
Mr Bangemann also has his own agenda. The industry's tight grip on
distribution offers a convenient way of administering the EU's
'transitional' curbs on Japanese car sales by keeping deliveries to
individual countries within agreed limits. In effect, Brussels is preaching
a single market while allowing it to be segmented by the back door.
Aligned against the system are the Commission's competition directorate and
consumer groups, which argue that the costs to car buyers far exceed the
benefits. In spite of efforts by Brussels to simplify 'parallel imports'
across borders, critics say the distribution arrangements impede trade and
perpetuate price differentials between EU members.
Greater choice
In weighing their decision, the 17 commissioners need to keep two points
clearly in mind. One is that the existing arrangements look archaic, at
best. When the emphasis in most of retailing is on greater choice and
convenience, it is hard to justify 'exclusive' dealerships restricted to one
brand.
The much-increased reliability of modern cars also weakens the case for
restricting servicing to franchised dealers, which surveys have in any case
found to perform no better than independent garages. Nor does manufacturers'
defence of the dealership system square with their increasing tendency to
sell direct to fleet operators - a practice blamed for inflating prices for
individual buyers.
The second point is that conditions in the European car industry have
changed radically since the existing exemption was granted. Competition has
grown much fiercer and the pace of restructuring and product innovation is
accelerating. Furthermore, the EU is committed to a barrier-free car market
by 1999, when curbs on Japanese car sales are due to be abolished.
Biggest anomalies
It is against this perspective that the future of car distribution
arrangements should be judged. Any further exemption from competition rules
should not extend beyond the end of the decade and should be modified to
remove its biggest anomalies.
The most obvious is the exclusive dealership provision. There is a case for
requiring franchised dealers to meet certain standards. But this is best
achieved by setting objective criteria and obliging manufacturers to supply
any dealer who satisfies them.
Another positive step would be to allow distribution and sales to be
performed separately from servicing. The main argument for keeping them
integrated is that it enables dealers to cross-subsidise between the two
activities - a practice not obviously to consumers' advantage.
Finally, the Commission should ensure that its efforts to encourage
'parallel imports' really bite. These provide the strongest incentive to
move towards the harmonisation of car prices across the EU which will follow
from the creation of a true single market.
Manufacturers will undoubtedly protest against any change in the existing
system while they are beset by weak demand, excess capacity and the impact
of violent currency fluctuations. However, the Commission should make it
clear that their long-term interests are best served not by throwing them
another lifebelt, but by helping them better to swim.

With the election of Mr Yuri Meshkov as president of Crimea, Ukraine has
taken another step towards the fate of Croatia. Crimea stands in relation to
Ukraine much as the enclave of Knin did to Croatia in 1990. For Serbs, read
Russians.
Mr Meshkov, an ethnic Russian like 70 per cent of the Crimean population (a
figure ominously close to the 73 per cent of the electorate which voted for
him last Sunday), favours reuniting Crimea with Russia, from which it was
severed administratively when Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine in 1954,
and politically when the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent
republics at the end of 1991. He has toned down his rhetoric on this point,
to avoid an immediate confrontation with the Ukrainian authorities, but is
still planning to hold a referendum in March on 'an independent Crimea in
union with other CIS states', a move which Ukraine's President Leonid
Kravchuk regards as unconstitutional.
Ukraine has treated its ethnic minorities, including Russians, much more
tactfully than Croatia did its Serb minority. So far Russians elsewhere in
Ukraine are not emulating those of Crimea, and even in Crimea there has as
yet been mercifully little violence. But the potential for clashes is very
great, if Mr Meshkov tries to set up his own militia, or if Ukrainian
national guards try to stop him going ahead with his referendum. Russian
troops belonging to the Black Sea fleet in Sebastopol might all too easily
become involved, as other Russian units have in comparable struggles in
Georgia and Moldova.
Underestimate
The previous Russian parliament laid formal claim to Crimea as Russian
territory, and the new one is hardly likely to be less nationalistic.
Indeed, few Russians of any political persuasion seem to regard Ukraine's
independence as serious or permanent. Most dangerously, many seem to
underestimate both the capacity and the willingness of Ukraine's armed
forces to fight.
Talk of war 'between two nuclear powers' may be excessively alarmist, since
Ukraine is not really a nuclear power. The ex-Soviet strategic weapons still
based on its territory are pointed at US targets and controlled by Moscow,
if anybody. Even so, war between Russia and Ukraine would be a much more
serious affair than the wars we have seen so far in Moldova, Transcaucasia
or even Yugoslavia. It could involve very large forces, causing hundreds of
thousands of deaths and many millions of refugees. It would create a feeling
of acute insecurity throughout central Europe, and almost inevitably mark
the beginning of a new cold war between Russia and the west - a cold war
perhaps even more dangerous than the last, with Russia under less stable and
more openly nationalistic leadership.
Ukraine's frontiers
Western governments should be doing everything possible to avert this
prospect. An outright guarantee to come to Ukraine's defence against Russia
would hardly be credible, but they should make it clear that they would not
turn a blind eye to any violation of Ukraine's frontiers. Russia itself has
repeatedly recognised those frontiers - most recently in the tripartite
agreement between Presidents Clinton, Kravchuk and Yeltsin on January 14,
under which the remaining missiles in Ukraine are to be dismantled.
Intervention by the Black Sea fleet or any other Russian units in internal
Ukrainian fighting would clearly infringe that agreement.
If Russia expresses anxiety about the fate of ethnic Russians in Crimea or
elsewhere, the west could offer a preventive deployment of UN forces. Such a
deployment has helped stabilise the situation in Macedonia.
But the west would also have to make it very clear to Ukraine that western
support is conditional not only on the Ukrainian parliament ratifying the
tripartite agreement, but also on it adopting policies which can unite
Ukraine's people, regardless of nationality. There is just a chance of that
happening if the elections in March produce a parliament in which western
nationalists and eastern economic reformers work together, accepting that
Ukraine can be independent and yet retain close economic and cultural ties
with Russia. The relationship between Austria and Germany provides a
possible model.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Personal View: A perverse loss of local knowledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK STRAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The holistic planner overlooks the fact that it is easy to centralise
power, but impossible to centralise all that knowledge . . . necessary for
the wise wielding of that centralised power . . . (so) the greater the gain
in power, the greater will be the loss of knowledge' -
Sir Karl Popper, philosopher,
The Poverty of Historicism.
It is a nice irony that those in Britain who have been among Popper's
greatest disciples should now be so deaf to his injunctions. It was one
such, Michael Heseltine, who in 1979, when he was environment secretary,
pledged 'to sweep away tiresome and excessive control over local
government'. But 14 years later, with the passage of 144 separate acts of
Parliament, each shifting power from town hall to Whitehall, the
Conservatives have created the most centralised system in western Europe.
Government orders to be pushed through the Commons today will turn the screw
on councils still tighter.
The system is cumbersome, inefficient and unfair. It has led to the
gratuitous loss of services and jobs in many boroughs, particularly those in
urban areas, which have had their budgets forced well below the level
necessary to maintain a decent level of service.
But there are also councils whose budgets have been forced above the levels
which local councillors - and electors - thought appropriate. In January
1993, Ernest Mallett, Conservative leader of the Elmbridge District Council
in Surrey, described the capping system as a 'joke' which encouraged
councils to 'spend up'. He added: 'If there were no capping, our spending
would probably be about Pounds 1m lower.'
As Popper said, the greater the centralised power, the greater will be the
loss of knowledge. Ministers cannot know what the priorities should be in
every community across the land. So to establish a consistent system of
budget control, the judgments of 24,000 councillors in 400 councils have to
be reduced to a mathematical formula.
But there are no data, and there is no algebra, which can do this fairly or
sensitively. Trial and error is used, producing the most preposterous
results. Oxford is declared to be more deprived than Liverpool, Bournemouth
has worse social conditions than Barnsley. The formulae are then 'massaged',
'damped', and leeway has to be built in to avoid, in particular boroughs, a
melt-down in public services (which not even social security secretary Peter
Lilley would contemplate).
It all ends with a circumstance stunningly reminiscent of 1970s incomes
policies, so despised today. In place of discretion, or negotiation, there
is a national 'going rate' and electors are denied choice. As Sarah
Whitehouse, a delegate to the Conservative party conference in October, put
it: 'Under rate capping (sic), you can't tell the difference between Labour
and Tory.'
Furthermore, the overall effect on public spending is perverse. In the words
of Tony Travers, author of a London School of Economics study, budget
capping has 'led to higher spending by councils, the opposite result to that
intended'.
So what should replace this apology for a system? First, central government
should cease trying to control what local councils spend on current services
from their own local tax base. Just five years ago, this was John Major's
policy. As the then chief secretary to the Treasury, he published the
quaintly titled white paper, 'A New Public Expenditure Planning Total'. In
this, he said that mixing central government spend with local council
self-financed expenditure 'blurs the status of the various aggregates'. So
he proposed that, in future, the Treasury's planning total should include
only central government grant to councils, and exclude locally raised
revenue. The policy lasted for about six months, but the case is as strong
as ever.
Second, councils' tax base should be broadened to include revenue from the
business rate. Today, the council tax raises just 20 per cent of total
spend. Third, the central government grant which each council receives
should be cash limited.
Fourth, annual elections, with a third of councillors retiring each year,
should be introduced in every council area. London local democracy is far
less effective than in, say, my constituency of Blackburn, where an election
is never more than months away. Annual elections would also produce greater
continuity and stability in councils.
Then the electors would be able to exercise power, with knowledge. To the
extent that the chancellor either knew or cared about local councils'
self-financed expenditure, he would probably find that over time its trend
was lower than if he had continued to interfere in it.

FT  03 FEB 94 / The FT Interview: Long haul across Ulster's quagmire - Sir
Patrick Mayhew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stage this week has been held by Mr Gerry Adams. His visit to New York
was a formidable coup for the man who has long cultivated an image as the
respectable face of IRA terrorism. The often naive questions from the US
television interviewers who feted the president of Sinn Fein during his
48-hour trip were a gift to such an accomplished propagandist.
So if the public reaction of the UK government to President Bill Clinton's
decision to grant Mr Adams a visa has been restrained, the private anger has
been real. Efforts to end the conflict in Northern Ireland do not sit easily
alongside appeasement of Irish-Americans in Boston and New York.
In any event Mr Adams's US trip has done nothing to change the realities of
a conflict which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in 25 years. Even as he
was appealing in New York for 'peace', the IRA fired a 150lb mortar bomb at
British troops. Nobody was killed. But it will not be long before the bombs
and bullets - from loyalist as well as republican paramilitaries - add more
names to the death roll.
Sitting in his elegant office in Belfast's Stormont Castle, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was concerned with these realities.
In an hour-long interview he insisted the Anglo-Irish declaration signed in
December by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish
prime ministers, would in the end provide the basis for durable peace.
Sir Patrick refused to speculate publicly on the odds of an early end to the
violence, but he gave the impression of a man preparing for the long haul.
Intelligence reports on his desk almost certainly confirm the competing
doves and hawks in the IRA have decided for the time being to put internal
unity ahead of peace.
Sir Patrick's message was that, whatever the IRA does in the short term, the
joint principles laid down in the declaration are inviolable.
The two governments had spelt out that Ulster could not be coerced into a
united Ireland. Nor would Britain take on the role of a 'persuader' in
seeking to break the province's links with the rest of the UK. But it would
not stand in the way of Irish unity if that was ever the democratic wish of
a majority in the north.
As Sir Patrick put it: 'Each government has shown that it understands and
accepts the validity of the aspirations of each side in the divided
community . . . each government has agreed that the future of Northern
Ireland will be decided by the wishes of the people living in Northern
Ireland. And that is terribly important.'
The republican charge that Britain is an imperialist power was no longer
sustainable. Northern Ireland is no Gaza strip or Cyprus, where people are
denied access to the ballot box.
Despite Mr Clinton's decision this week, Sir Patrick is convinced that
agreement between London and Dublin on the province's future will lead to
progressive international isolation of the IRA.
Meanwhile, the two governments would give impetus to efforts to reinstate
devolved administration in Northern Ireland and to enhance co-operation
between north and south.
Sir Patrick will table within two weeks an outline plan for a new political
settlement. The plan - to be presented to the Ulster Unionist party, the
mainly-Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian
Alliance party - will centre on a new devolved assembly in Ulster.
It will also include proposals for a number of cross-border executive boards
with responsibility for such areas as tourism and the environment. Rev Ian
Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party will be invited back to the
table.
Together these proposals make up strands one and two of the so-called
three-stranded search for a comprehensive political settlement. Strand
three, as it is known, is concerned with updating the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement between the two governments.
Sir Patrick cleared up once and for all the government's position on Mr
Adams's repeated demands for clarification, negotiation (call it what you
will), of the Downing Street text. He will not get it.
Mr Adams wanted a place at the table before the IRA had stopped its killing:
'It is entirely clear what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration .
. . And we are not going to do it.'
There was 'a place and time for negotiation about the future of Northern
Ireland - its status and everything else to do with it. That place and time
is during the talks from which nobody is excluded except those who say: 'We
wish actually to fortify our arguments with bombs''.
Mr Adams knows it and, in Sir Patrick's judgment, is playing for time.
Nor will a temporary truce do: 'The government will not negotiate with Adams
or anyone else unless and until they have permanently ended violence or
permanently ended the justification for violence. I have made that clear
time and time again. So have the Irish. There is no daylight between us on
this.'
The reasoning is obvious: 'If you negotiate with people who want a united
Ireland . . . in those circumstances (of continuing violence) it would
undercut fatally other nationalist politicians who accept the disciplines of
constitutional politics.' For other nationalist politicians you can
substitute Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader.
It is Mr Adams and his allies, not the British government, who have it
within their power to bring peace. 'The right analogy seems to me to be
this. Sinn Fein have the key. The key is this: their ability to give up
violence . . . if they put it in the lock now and turn it, consequences
follow which have been spelt out.' But either way the declaration will
remain on the table: 'The lock is not going to be changed.'
Nor will the two governments allow Sinn Fein to paralyse the search for a
political settlement: 'The joint declaration is not a substitute for the
(political) talks process. It complements it. But it is not a substitute for
it.'
So after months of tortuous negotiations, Sir Patrick will table what he
calls a 'framework of ideas' to secure agreement among the province's
constitutional parties on strands one and strand two.
He is under no illusions that progress will be rapid: 'It's a delicate,
slow, pragmatic process.' A previous attempt to secure agreement broke down
in acrimony in 1992. For the time being at least the discussions will
continue on a bilateral basis with each party.
The moderate Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux want a devolved
assembly but they are not interested in enhanced co-operation with Dublin.
The DUP, which walked out of the talks to protest against the joint
declaration, has yet to agree even to join discussions.
Mr Molyneaux must be kept on side. Mr John Major's government depends upon
his support. So Sir Patrick is adamant that there can be nothing in strand
two (structures for cross-border co-operation) which the unionists might
condemn as representing joint authority between London and Dublin over
affairs in the province.
But the constitutional nationalists represented by Mr Hume are only
interested in devolution if it is slotted into the context of much closer
co-operation between North and South. They must be given something if they
are to sign up to an assembly. And so on - the complexities and
complications are endless.
It will take months if not years to get within striking distance of an
agreement. The whole process could yet founder on the prejudices and
suspicions which scar the politics of Northern Ireland. Holding the present
alliance with Dublin will not be easy if the IRA continues its campaign.
But in Sir Patrick's view there is no other route. For all his success in
New York, Mr Adams, identified as a dove in the IRA power struggle which has
followed the Downing Street declaration, knows it.

Sir, British Aerospace may well be crowing at the sale of Rover to BMW.
Corporate Britain, however, should be far more apprehensive.
Corporate Japan views its long-term corporate partnership arrangements very,
very seriously and Honda has surely honoured its part in the resuscitation
of Rover from a basket-case to where it stands today.
It may therefore be a long time before any other corporate giant in Japan
signs a similar, so-called long-term partnership agreement with any other
flagship of British industry.

Sir, BMW's acquisition of Rover is a bold and imaginative strategy to hit
three birds with one stone: to acquire Land Rover 4x4 technology, products
and markets, and to stuff its two principal global competitors, Mercedes
Benz and Honda. If Rover can be successfully assimilated it will be a
remarkable coup.
However, it needs to be recalled that research demonstrates, and experience
in this industry more than confirms, that the success ratio for mergers and
acquisitions is no better than one in two. Also, BMW has got to where it is
today by the successful management of organic growth, not through
acquisition.
Time alone will tell if BMW's top management can successfully manage this,
its first, acquisition without squandering the opportunities it clearly
presents or doing serious damage to Land Rover, one of the UK's
incontestably world-class businesses.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: The flaw in local government argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P HARFORD, Ms H PEARSON and Ms K KIRKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The politics of local government' (February 2),
accurately assesses many of the reasons why there is now so much hostility,
both within Westminster and throughout the UK, to the local government
review. There is no doubt that the business community is horrified by the
proposals emanating from the Local Government Commission. There is equally
no doubt that council taxpayers are becoming increasingly concerned at the
costs they would have to pay.
However, your suggestion that halting the review nationally and limiting
changes to a small number of areas, including Cleveland, offers the 'best
exit route' is indefensible. Such a move would almost certainly leave the
government open to yet further legal challenges.
A central flaw in that argument is the myth, regrettably repeated in your
comment, that the 'new' counties such as Cleveland have 'failed to win
popular support' and, by implication, are therefore prime candidates for
change.
The facts are that, on the evidence of the Mori polls carried out for the
Local Government Commission, the level of public identity with Cleveland is
actually higher than many so-called 'traditional' counties, including
Lincolnshire (where the commission is recommending the status quo of county
and districts), Gloucestershire and Derbyshire.
In terms of 'user satisfaction', an opinion poll carried out by Harris
Research in 1992 showed no less than 79 per cent of residents satisfied with
Cleveland's services, one of the highest figures recorded for any authority
in recent years.
That does not mean we do not recognise the desirability of change - provided
it produces better services, greater cost-efficiency and has the support of
local people. A unified Teesside, with a second authority to recognise the
unique sense of identity in Hartlepool, is the only option which can deliver
those essential requirements. Teesside, by the way, enjoys an even higher
level of public identity than the Yorkshire Ridings or Somerset.
But that is not what is being proposed by the commission. It has ignored the
views of those in business, health, education, the voluntary sector and
many, many thousands of Teessiders. Instead it proposes a costly,
inefficient and unwanted division of services in England's smallest mainland
county among four unitary authorities based on existing district boundaries.
Your leader warned against 'unviably small replacements', but that is what
is being proposed.
On the basis of the commission's own estimates, such a disastrous proposal
would involve transitional costs of between Pounds 13m and Pounds 18m,
together with additional running costs of up to Pounds 10m a year compared
with a united Teesside authority.
It would be a disgrace if this were imposed on the local community at the
same time as the review was being shelved elsewhere. The interests of the
people of Teesside should not be sacrificed simply in order to save face in
Westminster.

ETHNIC SELF-DETERMINATION AND THE BREAK-UP OF STATES

NEW APPROACHES TO MINORITY PROTECTION

Old states have split up, and new ones are unable to agree on their
frontiers. Ethnic conflict rages in the former Yugoslavia and in many parts
of the former Soviet Union. And there is almost certainly more to come.
As Kamal Shehadi warns, in his Adelphi paper published by the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, 'self-determination conflicts are likely to
continue to plague the Russian federation and many of its surrounding
states, as well as the Balkans, China, India, Burma, Indonesia, Iraq,
Turkey, Ethiopia and the rest of the Horn of Africa, Sudan and South
Africa'.
In all those places, people are asserting a national identity which they
feel is not reflected in, or recognised by, the state of which they are
citizens, or subjects, or at least residents. Many of them are asking for a
new state, or for the territory where they live to be transferred to another
existing state with which they identify. Almost always this demand is
resisted by the state they now belong to, and frequently the result is
bloodshed, culminating in the forced displacement of populations.
This process is destructive of international order. The flood of refugees;
the power of example; the danger of contamination if weapons of mass
destruction are used: all these, as well as humanitarian revulsion, make it
impossible for great powers to ignore the problem. Traditional responses are
clearly inadequate. The hunt is on for a new approach.
Shehadi's paper, along with Gidon Gottlieb's Nation Against State and New
Approaches to Minority Protection by Asbjorn Eide are all contributions to
that search. Shehadi looks at the process of self-determination, and argues
that it is 'a dynamic process, not an end'. Self-determination 'makes the
people the source of state sovereignty and thus implies a democratic form of
government'. This does not follow automatically from national independence,
nor is national independence the only way to achieve it.
But democracy is a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for genuine
self-government. Where politics is polarised on ethnic or communal lines,
majority rule gives ethnic minorities no say in how they are governed,
unless there are special provisions to that effect. So Shehadi devotes much
of his argument to recommending ways in which states can ensure that their
ethnic minorities do not feel obliged to seek self-determination through
secession.
There is thus a considerable overlap between his paper and the Minority
Rights Group pamphlet by Eide, a Norwegian human rights specialist.
Eide's approach is more theoretical, Shehadi's more pragmatic. But both make
a distinction between the 'common domain' - decisions affecting all
citizens, in which the minority must be given an effective share - and the
'separate domain', where minorities can run their own affairs through
autonomous institutions. Where the minority forms a local majority in a
given region, autonomy can take the form of territorial 'arrangements'
(Shehadi) or 'subdivisions' (Eide), in some cases extending even to a
federal or confederal system - though this is often resisted by the
majority, out of fear that it will lead to secession.
Shehadi also observes that self-determination has an 'external' aspect - the
right of a community 'to shape its ties, legal and otherwise, with other
political entities, be they sovereign states, ethnic minority groups or
international organisations'.
This thought is taken further by Gottlieb, a US lawyer, who proposes
divorcing the idea of nation from that of state, so that 'nations and
peoples that have no state of their own can be recognised as such and
endowed with an international legal status'.
Such non-state nations could even, Gottlieb suggests, be associated with a
'national home', which would sometimes stretch across state boundaries. An
Irish national home, for instance, 'could provide a framework for a new
all-Irish national authority, with authority over matters of common concern
to the republic and to the Catholic inhabitants in the North who wish to be
included', but 'would not affect the Protestant majority'. Security would
remain a British responsibility, but 'it should be possible to construct
arrangements to devolve jurisdiction over police matters, for example, to
the local and sub-municipal levels'.
That sounds uncomfortably like the 'no go' areas of the early 1970s. But
Gottlieb, to do him justice, is not claiming to have found the solution to
conflicts as bitter and complex as that in Northern Ireland. He merely
suggests a general approach which might help solve such conflicts, if and
when the parties are genuinely anxious to do so.
The essence of this approach is that all power does not have to be vested in
a single sovereign state. Power can be divided into functions and
distributed among different authorities, with overlapping jurisdictions - as
already happens in the domestic affairs of most states. Such ideas are
valuable, but more likely to work before violence breaks out, or when there
has already been a longish period of peace. The power of the gun is the
least easy to share, and the scope for ingenious power-sharing arrangements
is much reduced when people are genuinely in fear of their lives. All that
matters then is Lenin's question, 'Who Whom?', or Humpty Dumpty's 'Who is to
be master?'

Sir, Re Michael Thompson-Noel's Hawks &amp; Handsaws column ('Tunnel of sighs',
January 29/30), polar bears might well have strolled from Normandy to Kent
during the last ice age. However, it is highly unlikely that the TGV, en
route to the Channel tunnel, and at any given speed, will ever reach the
Normandy coast.
The French tunnel terminal is at Sangatte, which is in the 'region' of
Nord-Pas de Calais. Readers wishing to stroll or drive directly from Kent to

Sir, Tardily, but enthusiastically, I congratulate your paper on the
inspired article, 'Back to front basics' (January 15), by the Rt Rev Hugh
Dickinson, Dean of Salisbury.
The brilliant summation of the 'systemic malaise' of the Thatcher years and
his call for the 'moral reconstruction' of our society should be essential
memoranda in the evening prayers of our fallible political masters,
especially of my fellow Catholic, Mr John Patten, who is striving so hard to
destabilise the democratic checks and balances in the education service.

Sir, While I found your article on the fortunes of Chinese industry
interesting ('Long leash for a runaway economy', February 2) it seemed to
miss out one key word: democracy.
Or are we still at the stage where we only criticise the human rights abuses
of those countries with which we do not wish to do business?

FT  03 FEB 94 / Arts: Donizetti's 'L'elisir d'amore' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If an opera company wants to enter into a partnership of some kind in
Europe, where better to go than Maastricht? The city that produced a treaty
as full of drama and complications as any grand opera is also the
part-originator of Scottish Opera's latest collaborative venture, a shared
production of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore.
It is a modest undertaking, accomplished without a hitch. While
Euro-sceptics may look upon the treaty as a tragedy in five acts, this short
Donizetti opera is a comedy which asks for a light touch. The Scottish-based
producer Giles Havergal has not tried anything outlandish. Although his
staging does not probe the emotional issues as tellingly as it might, the
basis is there for a good, standard addition to Scottish Opera's repertory.
The curtain goes up to reveal a picture of idyllic country life - literally,
as the stage is encased in a giant, golden frame. As the sun beats down,
women in wide-brimmed hats help their menfolk harvest the summer's crop of
apples and oranges. Havergal knows how to arrange his chorus in attractive
groupings. The designer, Russell Craig, has provided colourful sets and
costumes, especially strong on complimentary red and green.
From a programme note one might have thought that the producer intended to
stress some 'magic' element in the opera, but it was not to be. Although
Donizetti's quack doctor sells what he claims is a mystical elixir, it is in
fact nothing but a bottle of Bordeaux. The coming-together of the young
couple is achieved not by any magic potion, but through their true feelings
 -the twist in the comedy that should make it touch the heart.
The cast, led with brio by the conductor Marco Guidarini, does not quite
manage that. Cheryl Barker sings Adina's music with sparkle and made the
transition from cold, bookish minx to loveable girl-next-door wholly
convincing. Simon Keenlyside's bumptious Belcore struts across the stage,
tweaking his moustache, twirling his baton: another amusing characterisation
from this imaginative baritone. Lisa Milne is a delightful Gianetta. The
only weak link is the gruffly-sung Dulcamara of Claude Corbeil, who comes
dressed like the Mad Hatter, but is not half as much fun.
In the key role of Nemorino the company has fielded Paul Charles Clarke, who
is probably as Italianate a tenor as Scottish Opera can hope to attract. The
voice has a good ring to it at the top, though it returns to its English
roots on certain vowel sounds lower down. As a bel canto stylist, he knows
how to spin out the tone in an instrumental fashion when he wants to. 'Una
furtiva lagrima' was well sung, but not as moving as it can be.
Why? The trouble is that the role of poor, simple-minded Nemorino is an
awkward one, which needs to be played with tact. Clarke laudably tries not
to overdo the simplicity, but ends up failing to do enough to win one's
sympathy. His Nemorino is just too sure of himself to be ignored and
rebuffed, so in the last resort the heart is not warmed, the potion has not
worked. In the best performances perhaps there is a kind of magic, after
all.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Arts: April in Paris - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Godber, the writer/director from Hull, is still in his 30s. Already he
has a string of successes behind him. Bouncers, Teechers and Up'n'Under were
all admirably professional. The titles described the subjects, the last
being about rugby league. They were full of zest, social observation and
competence.
Sadly, I missed On the Piste (another expressive title) when it played - to
some acclaim - in the West End last year. But it never occurred to me until
the opening of April in Paris at the Ambassadors this week that Godber is
one of the best contemporary British playwrights.
The piece is not quite new. First performed in Hull in 1992, it has toured
the country and ran on the Fringe - to mixed reviews - throughout last
year's Edinburgh Festival. It has arrived in London with a new cast: Gary
Olsen and Maria Friedman. Splendid as they are, most of the praise must go
to the writing and the direction, which is by Godber himself.
April in Paris can be only described as a comedy. Some of it is very funny.
Yet it is the sadness that prevails,
along with the craftsmanship. Olsen and Ms Friedman are the sole characters.
Married for nearly 10 years, they
quarrel, yet remain mutually dependent; there is never much chance that they
will part.
He is a physically large man, suffering the pains of having been made
redundant. He paints in his shed, mainly pictures of power stations in
sombre colours. She is half his size, neat and good-looking, still has a job
and spends her spare time entering magazine competitions. She wins a trip
for two, including 'a night of luxury' on North Sea Ferries to Paris.
Neither she nor her husband have been abroad before, and not very far out of
Hull.
The first hint that this might be an out-of-the-ordinary play comes when the
storm in the North Sea clears and the husband, a reluctant traveller,
catches a glimpse of the receding English coast. 'Have you noticed,' he
says, 'how sad the people in the streets have become?'
Paris is a revelation. They love it. The artist in the husband comes out
when he sees the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. He accepts a steak tartare in a
restaurant without knowing what it is, then overcomes his revulsion to find
it delicious. The wife picks up French faster than he does, but even he
agrees to go on the Metro and stuns her by asking for a carnet at the ticket
office.
This is, incidentally, the most pro-France and pro-European Union play that
I have seen by a British writer - possibly the only one. There are no cheap
jokes about foreigners. With the liberation supplied by Paris, the couple
begin to call each other by their first names, Al and Bet, for the first
time in years.
The return to Hull is an anti-climax, but life will never be the same again.
Al continues to paint in his shed, but now - in bright colours - a
surrealistic Eiffel Tower. This time it is the husband looking at the
magazines for travel prizes - like taking his wife to Mexico, which gives
the play a very neat ending.
The sets, designed by Robert Jones, are integral to the piece: small black
and white for the house in Hull, then a few minor changes to show a ship in
storm, and finally, in the second act, a huge background of the Moulin
Rouge. Some of the vignettes are superb: watch Al and Bet travelling
together standing in a crowded Metro after midnight. Rarely can two players
complement each other so well as Olsen and Ms Friedman. As for Godber, he
has arrived as a playwright who can combine comedy, depth and feeling.

Thanks to revisionist historians it is no longer a secret that the famous
'Dam Busters' raid by 617 Squadron was not as effective in damaging German
manufacturing effort as the British pretended, even if it was a mighty
propaganda triumph. More than half a century after the event Secret History
sets out to give a sober version of events, and re-unites the crew of F for
Freddy, the bomber which was supposed to breach the Sorpe dam but failed
(9.00 C4).
In Great Railway Journeys Michael Palin moves down a gear or two from his
globe-trotting stunts to travel from Londonderry to Kerry (9.30 BBC2).
Thursday is the night for those who like modern comedy. The All New Alexei
Sayle Show (9.00 BBC2) finishes just in time to switch to BBC1 for the
second episode in the new series of Abfab, or Absolutely Fabulous as they
still bill it, and that is followed immediately by The Man From Auntie. Thus
in 90 minutes of continuous humour you get Sayle, Jennifer Saunders and
Joanna Lumley and Ben Elton.

Here are some of the rewards offered to good filmmakers across the world. In
America, they give Oscars; in Britain, Baftas; in France, Cesars; in Europe,
Felixes; in China, detention sentences and/or visa confiscations.
This is what happened to Tian Zhuangzhuang. 'Where is he?' we cried last
year at Cannes when his film The Blue Kite became the sleeper of the
Directors Fortnight. This movie about the everyday terrors of life under the
sway of Mao and his Little Red Mind should be spoken of in the same awed
breath as Farewell My Concubine. Passion, compassion and a searching,
majestic irony join together in the history of a family concussed by
Communism.
So where was Tian? Back in China after having his exit visa taken away. And
why does The Blue Kite trespass across forbidden political airspace? Because
it chronicles 20 years in the life of a family based on Tian's own as its
members endure the cruel, interchangeably wintry seasons of Maoist rule.
From the Sino-Stalinism of the early 1950s the film moves through the
'Hundred Flowers' and the 'Great Leap Forward' and finally the Cultural
Revolution. Iced-up movements all: designed less to enhance or advance the
lives of the people than to crystallise the tyrannies of their leaders.
Nothing wintry, though, about the movie. Characters sketched with lightest
shadings grow their own irresistible warmth and colour as we watch. There is
the librarian Shujuan (Lu Liping), wistfully enduring a life of serial
wedlock as she loses one husband to political exile, then marries his
repentant betrayer, then ends up with a dried-out old Professor. There are
her quizzical, button-bright son Tietou (our main point-of-view character);
her yappy Marxist sister; her sweet-natured, weak-willed brother, who loses
his girlfriend to one of several passing purges; and others still, filling
up a fresco of Chinese street life that seems real to every brushstroke.
Tian portrays this life built on deprivation and thought-policing with a
naturalism at once tender and abrasive. Popular Maoist songs are offered up
for mockery: 'We don't give peace to invaders or bad people]' sing a bunch
of wedding guests; 'Wipe out waste, decay and bureaucracy]' warble a group
of schoolchildren. But the movie never stops at mere scorn. It swells from
the modest, multiple-choice pathos of early scenes - divided families,
fractured loyalties - to a kind of vast silent tragedy: the story of a
nation whose people survived despite an experiment in nationhood that
grimly, resoundingly failed.
Wayne's World shocked the planet recently by disproving King Lear's theory
that nothing will come of nothing. Two completely empty heads, the comedy
showed, could fill cinema cash registers across the globe. Wayne (Michael
Myers) was the head with long dark hair and a face like a Halloween turnip.
Garth (Dana Carvey) was the head with long blond hair and a face like Norman
Bates's mother. When not co-hosting their DIY chat show on public-access TV,
our teenage twosome sallied forth from Aurora, Illinois, to spread the
gospel of rock culture and insane catch-phrases.
In Wayne's World 2 they stage a 'real' pop concert - Waynestock - with help
from Kim Basinger, Charlton Heston, Aerosmith, Rip Taylor and any other
celebrity who happened to be trapped inside Paramount Studio's perimeter
fence during shooting.
This is the mixture as before, so why is it so much funnier? One reason: its
silliness-on-a-loop humour works like mesmerism, lulling you with repetition
before manipulating your funny-bone at will. Reason two: in translating
themselves to movies from their Saturday Night Live American TV slot, Myers
and Carvey have developed a flair for duffing up movie lore itself. Jurassic
Park, Field Of Dreams and The Graduate are among a dozen-odd films invited
into the script's orbit in order to be knocked about. And the best joke is a
delayed-action gem about the function of melons, chicken crates and sheets
of replacement glass when wheeled into place on a movie street.
Most comedy traditions can be seen in terms of Biblical genealogies. Bill
and Ted begat Wayne and Garth and Wayne and Garth might have begotten - by
triangular interbreeding with Monty Python - Jacquouille and Godefroy in Les
Visiteurs. This has been the greatest box-office success, bar none, in
French cinema history. Fourteen million Gauls have paid umpteen million
francs to watch a medieval knight and his squire (tall and stately Jean
Reno, squat and manic Christian Chalonge) flung into present-day Languedoc
after a mix-up with a witches' spell.
Here they experience culture shock and so does the audience. (How is your
ear for 1990s-colloquialised Medieval French?) The posh hotel in which
Jacquouille and Godefroy run bewilderedly amok is none other than J's old
family castle now converted into a relais and managed by limp-wristed
Jacques-Hebri (Chalonge doubling up). It is also owned by a descendant of
the knight's 12th century fiancee Beatrix (Valerie Lemercier, France's
answer to Penelope Keith, also doubling up).
There is, as you see, much doubling up: more than there may be among
non-French audiences. Having taken a nervous eternity to reach Britain, the
film now offers its blend of esoteric Gallic humour with high-pressure
subtitles. Will audiences in outer Wolverhampton crack up at the sight of
two time-confused Middle-Agers washing their faces in a bidet? Or throwing
Chanel No 5 into the bath as if it were bath mousse? (But what would they
know about bath mousse?) Or falling foul of 'supermarkets,' those strange
indoor stadiums filled with wire-mesh chariots?
And so on, with a mixture of overzealous slapstick and undernourished
reliance on the hilarity of anachronism. Jean-Marie Poire's film suggests
that more than a Channel Tunnel is needed to create a trans-manche link
between French and non-French senses of humour. But then they may say the
same after seeing Wayne's World 2.
But Les Visiteurs is beaten to this week's wooden spoon. That is shared
between Garth Maxwell's Jack Be Nimble from Australia and Michael
Steinberg's Bodies, Rest And Motion from the US.
The first is a ill-stirred stew of violence, hypnosis and revenge, all about
two separated-when-young siblings (Alexis Arquette, Sarah Smuts-Kennedy) who
reunite for a spot of grown-up carnage. Steinberg's film is an Arizona-set
tale of drifting lovers. Here the wooden spoon could have been used to hit
everyone over the head. It might have instilled some vitality into Eric
Stoltz, Bridget Fonda and Phoebe Cates; though Britain's Tim Roth does
better, leavening his portentous Zen-buddyist dialogue with an almost
plausible South-Western accent. The title, by the way, comes from one of
Newton's Laws: but not the one about the danger of sitting near overripe or
prententious plantings in case they drop heavy objects on you.
See instead Bertolucci's 25-year-old The Conformist, reissued in a new print
and looking a dream. Which of course it is: the reveries of a 1930s
political chameleon (Jean-Louis Trintignant), evolving from closet
homosexual to Fascist hit man to casualty of history. The images dazzle; the
camera behaves like Torvill and Dean on hallucinogens. A good film-maker
reaches his peak of almost-greatness, just before he sold out to
gift-wrapped Maoism (The Last Emperor) and guff-wrapped existentialism (The
Sheltering Sky).

FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: All at sea from the safety of a warehouse -
Simulators are being used for training, design and crisis management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standing on the bridge of a crude oil tanker, manoeuvring towards the
entrance of Tokyo Bay, our course is compromised by a cargo vessel coming
from the starboard. Curious to see how the ship simulator handles a
collision, I take aim at the cargo vessel and ask the first mate how long we
must wait for the moment of impact.
The answer is a patience-testing 'about five minutes'. More sophisticated
than a video game, but slower with the thrills and spills, the
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industry (IHI) simulator is intended to give a
ship's crew experience at the helm in the safety of a small warehouse.
Because standard instruments are used on the bridge, the simulator has a
reality that is more than virtual and the sound effects that come with a
collision are convincing. But even so, it is difficult to get away from the
sense that you are in a big room in central Tokyo surrounded by a video
screen, and this detracts from the tension of the experience.
IHI, the first Japanese company to build a simulator, in 1975, has just sold
a Y1bn (Pounds 6m) version to a maritime college in Bombay, and claims the
ability to recreate any international port setting or narrow-necked strait
for training purposes. All the company needs is a collection of images and
relevant information about the shifting currents in the area.
To imitate conditions on a real ship, IHI has put speakers under the floor
of the bridge, providing the crew with the vibrations that would come from
an engine beneath them. From behind the nautical instruments, the video
projection extends 225 degrees, covering the entire field of vision with
five overlapping screens.
A shipbuilder by trade, IHI has put standard instruments on the 'mimic
bridge', as it is called. The customer can then choose the type of mother
ship it requires - a tanker, car carrier, a ferry or large fishing vessel.
Potential obstacles range from a dimly-lit buoy to an errant yacht in the
shipping lanes.
Yoshitsugu Matsuura, the manager of the simulator project group at IHI, is a
little touchy when reminded of the similarity between an arcade video
car-racing game and a state-of-the-art ship simulator. 'They are on a
different scale and very different in their sophistication. A video game has
a video base and the simulator is a collection of different technologies.'
It is very sophisticated. When our vessel eventually collided with the cargo
vessel, there was a realistic scraping of metal, giving the impression that
we were badly holed and taking on water fast. On a separate simulator model,
designed to give the impression of being behind the wheel of a twin-hulled
jet propelled cruiser, our vessel passed silently through the video image of
a container carrier at the moment of impact.
IHI has paid attention to detail in creating the sea's texture, knowing that
the simulator's effectiveness will be devalued if trainees do not sense that
they are at sea. The blue bubbles and whirling currents are a blend of
computer graphics and video images. When the computer programmer turns down
the lights for night navigating, the simulated sea becomes convincingly dark
and forbidding, with the lights of land flickering in the distance.
After setting an obstacle course, the teacher is able to record the response
times of trainees at a separate terminal, returning after an exercise to
point out the faults of a clumsy attempt to dock or the dangers of failing
to give way at the entrance of a simulated harbour.
Apart from teaching trainees to avoid accidents, the equipment can be used
to recreate an accident scene. By programming the course of two vessels, and
copying the surrounding sea and weather conditions, whether it be a
fog-shrouded harbour or the rushing waters of high tide, investigators are
supposed to be able to experience an accident themselves.
Demand for the simulators is still a little slower than the cruising speed
of a very large crude carrier. Matsuura said IHI expects to sell one every
year or two, though the increasing sophistication of the electronic
components means the simulator is coming closer and closer to the real thing
and could generate interest from colleges which have so far preferred to do
their training at sea.
The equipment is part of the management justification for IHI's own
investment in electronics which has little direct relevance to the building
of ships, oil rigs or the other heavy industrial structures in which it has
most expertise. Japanese shipbuilders and steel companies have been
enthusiastic converts to the semiconductor and computer industries,
believing that as steel has traditionally been the country's 'industrial
rice', the chip is the industrial rice of the present and future.

FT  03 FEB 94 / People: Main course for GrandMet's Lowes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan has brought Robert Lowes, 48, into the role of chief
executive, Foods Europe, following the departure of the incumbent, Peter
Thompson, 47, to become president and chief executive of Walkers Smiths
Snack Foods, part of PepsiCo Foods and Beverages International.
Lowes has been with GrandMet since December 1989, when he joined as chief
financial officer of Pillsbury, based in the US. In April 1992, he moved to
London to become deputy group finance director. GrandMet Foods Europe
recorded profits of Pounds 958m in the year to September 1993.
Immediately before joining GrandMet, Lowes spent 12 years with Philip
Morris/General Foods in a variety of roles, ultimately as corporate
controller with Philip Morris in New York. His new job at GrandMet will be
based in Paris. Lowes' experience in the food business stretches back to
1975, when he first joined H J Heinz as an assistant manager in commodities
and finance.
Stepping into the vacated deputy group finance role - though the title is
now group controller - is David Rickard, 47, currently chief financial
officer of Pillsbury and of GrandMet Foods America. Like Lowes, a US
citizen, Rickard joined GrandMet in two years ago from an 18-year background
in various finance posts with Kraft General Foods in the US and Europe.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: Collapsing the system without getting the sack -
Simulators are being used for training, design and crisis management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If power engineers have nightmares, they probably include hurricanes,
thunderstorms, blizzards, bolts of lightning, generating equipment failures
and severe voltage losses - anything likely to threaten the electricity
system or even collapse it.
For most of them - at least in the National Grid system along which
electricity is distributed in England and Wales - such incidents never occur
in real life. Only around 20 per cent of those controlling the power system
ever experience any emergencies.
Thus when the National Grid planned its new Pounds 80m control network,
brought into operation last October, it included a sophisticated training
simulator designed to give those engineers who had only worked trouble-free
shifts a taste of what to expect when chaos intervened and nightmares came
to life.
'We're not trying to frighten them,' says Steve Allamby, lead instructor.
'But people on shift can go for a number of years without seeing major
faults. So we put them under very onerous multiple fault conditions like
hurricanes.'
Every one of the control engineers at the National Grid's four regional
centres and the national control centre in Wokingham, Berkshire, is being
put through the simulator course.
'This is the only place in the British Isles where you can collapse the
system and not get the sack,' says Gordon Stirrat, head of the simulator
training operation. Teams of engineers from around England and Wales -
Scotland's power distribution is handled by the generating companies - spend
two days at the simulator in St Albans, just north of London in
Hertfordshire. If Wokingham goes down for any reason, the St Albans facility
can rapidly be switched over from training to run the whole National Grid.
On the simulator, engineers are subjected to several scenarios of growing
severity. These are based on possible conditions in their own areas, so that
engineers from the south could be faced with winds from the English Channel
or a sudden failure in electricity imports from France, while those in the
north could have ice and snowstorms.
The instructors can use the simulation software to build up the series of
events so that the engineers have to cope with a 'cascade effect', as
Stirrat puts it. The faults are usually related, but it is not always
obvious which one is potentially the most serious. If the engineers are
coping too easily, extra faults can be introduced to stretch their abilities
further. To add to the confusion, a report can be phoned in of someone
having climbed a pylon, so that power has to be routed around it.
The effects on the power system of the hurricanes of 1987 in south-eastern
England can be recreated, as can the vicious countrywide snowstorms of 1990
which caused even more damage. A band of lightning which tends to sweep
across the south-east coast and up to East Anglia through London is also
featured.
In the midst of coping with all this, an instructor can distract the
engineers by pretending to be a regional grid manager and march on to the
control floor demanding an instant report on what is happening.
Each session lasts around two hours, with those on the simulator sitting at
a bank of computers in front of a large screen with a detailed diagram of
the National Grid. Engineers from the regions look at the part of the screen
containing their own power stations, sub-stations and electricity lines.
Flashing lights and indicators alert them to problems, to which they react
by studying their screens and telephoning experts along the network to find
out what is happening and have matters put right.
The roles of those at the other end of the telephone are played by
instructors and team members not involved in the session. They sit in a room
overlooking the simulator floor. As well as seeing how those on the
simulator handle the incidents, with only a few minutes available for some
solutions, the instructors also observe how well and coolly the senior team
member analyses events.
Generally, says Stirrat, engineers react correctly to the incidents thrown
at them. If they make mistakes, it is important they are aware of why things
went wrong. No one has yet found it all too much and walked off the floor,
but Stirrat recalls that an engineer did throw up his hands in (presumably)
mock despair once and cry out: 'I surrender.'

Tony Philipson, 47, has been appointed group chief executive of Porter
Chadburn, the consumer products and packaging company. He replaces Raymond
Dinkin who left in December after a run of poor results saw the share price
fall from 300p in 1987 to a low of 14p last month.
A graduate of Nottingham University, Philipson spent the 1970s at graphic
arts company Letraset before moving to Pritchard, the industrial services
group, in 1982.
But it will be his performance at Savage Group, the hardware supplier, where
he has been chief executive since 1991, that will hold most appeal for
Porter Chadburn's shareholders. When he took the helm, the company had a
market capitalisation of Pounds 12m. Two and a half years later, it was sold
to Midlands manufacturer, McKechnie, for Pounds 48m.
The key to that success was the elimination of losses in international
subsidiaries, an interest he will be able to maintain at Porter Chadburn,
whose US labelling business has continued to disappoint.

<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday
appointed Richard Smernoff to fill the vacancy created by the departure last
year of Michael Pavia, the former finance director.
Smernoff, 52, spent his early career with accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
with International Paper Company. He then spent 13 years with Amerada Hess,
the US oil company, where he was senior vice president and corporate
controller. In 1992 he spent a year with Lasmo in the US, helping in the
rationalisation that followed Lasmo's takeover of Ultramar.
That assignment was one factor behind his appointment, according to Joe
Derby, chief executive: 'We know he will fit into the Lasmo team'.
Smernoff's inter-personal and communication skills - another factor - are
likely to be subjected to an early test. Full year results for Lasmo, which
is particularly vulnerable to current low oil prices, are due shortly after
he takes over in March.

Browne's decision to exchange the comparative calm of Britain's biggest

team comes as a bit of a surprise. Taylor, who replaced Howell James in
November 1992, was brought in as part of BBC director general John Birt's
radical management shake-up.
Browne, a career BT man was director of BT Vision, responsible for

Until last year, Mendelsohn was president and chief operating officer of WR
Berkley Corporation, a successful non-life company whose recent operating
results have compared favourably with the rest of the US industry. If
Berkley's advertising slogan - 'Volume is vanity, profit is sanity' - is any
indication, Mendelsohn should feel at home with Royal's emphasis on
underwriting discipline rather than market share.
Royal's US company, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is ranked

FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: The human factor - Simulators are being used for
training, design and crisis management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aircraft simulators are normally used to train pilots and refresh the skills
of experienced flyers, but the newest equipment used by Lufthansa, the
German airline, goes a significant step further.
As well as putting trainees through their paces, its simulator is used for
research into how pilots behave in aircraft and into the best ways of
designing modern cockpits.
The DM40m (Pounds 15m) simulator is shared by Lufthansa and Berlin
University's Institute of Aerospace, where it is located. Its operating
company, the Centre for Flight Simulation (ZFB) is owned by Lufthansa,
Deutsche Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz), CAE (the Canadian company which
developed the software) and the state-owned German Aerospace Research
Institute.
Gerhard Huttig, head of ZFB, says today's pilots have to be equally at home
in the worlds of information processing and flying. 'Our central research
theme is the human factor and how people work with complex modern
equipment.'
The simulator is based on the latest long-range European Airbus A340. Run by
a powerful IBM computer, it is programmed with details of some 50 airports
to give pilots as realistic an impression of take-off and landing as
possible.
Lufthansa is the main user of the simulator, the first of its type, although
the National Aeronatics and Space Administration now has a similar one in
California based on a Boeing 747 cockpit. For research purposes, ZFB
switches to a separate IBM to run the programs for investigating the
ergonomic and health aspects of flying. Cameras and medical equipment are
used to monitor brain, heart and other reactions. Colour recognition and how
this is affected by ageing, is also studied. With a large amount of complex
digital information, it is important to know which colours are most
effective.
The simulator is also available to equipment manufacturers for cockpit
design. Huttig says French companies like Thomson and Aerospatiale have
expressed an interest in using it.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sex, humour and the
'me within' - Advertisers who wish to appeal to women should take heed of a
new survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women like sex and have a sense of humour; they no longer think of
themselves as the 'typical housewife'.
A few hours watching UK television commercials, however, might encourage
viewers to conclude otherwise.
The glum succession of women obsessed with the spotlessness of their floors
and weekly wash, and who crave the advice of male scientists in white coats,
contrasts sharply with the humour and inventiveness of, for example, some of
the beer advertising aimed principally at men.
Given that most TV commercials are for brands purchased by women,
surprisingly little is known about what kind of advertising appeals to them
and why, according to advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather.
The agency says commercials aimed at women are often boring and badly made,
are rarely of the calibre that win awards for creativity, and 'fail to get
under the skin' of their intended audience.
In an attempt to improve standards, O&amp;M's planning department in London,
which provides the research that underpins the agency's creative work, has
conducted a study among women of a variety of ages and social backgrounds.
The suggestion that women like more sex and humour than advertisers have
hitherto been prepared to believe, and are unlikely these days to think of
themselves as housewives, are among the study's main conclusions. Over the
next few weeks, the findings will be presented internally, and to the
agency's main clients, which include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and
consumer group; Ford, the car maker; health insurance group Bupa; and
American Express, the credit card group.
Detailed studies were made of 12 groups of women. The women filled in
diaries for a week, noting the advertisements they had watched and their
reactions to them. Then they met to discuss how they saw themselves, their
lives, what was important to them, and their views on brands and
advertising. They also discussed a number of commercials.
From the results, the 'onion theory' was developed, explains Beth Barry,
planning director. Women of different ages and at different stages in their
lives have more in common than many marketers believe, she says.
'As a woman progresses through lifestages, she accumulates knowledge,
responses, behaviour, like the layers of an onion. Moving to a new lifestage
doesn't mean discarding the experiences and memories of previous
lifestages,' she adds. A woman's sense of identity - the 'me within', as the
study refers to it - may be largely submerged or more evident at different
stages, but is always there and ready to be accessed or released by
advertising.
The 'me', found O&amp;M, is very strong among single women and those who have
partners but no children; by the time motherhood sets in women are most
likely to describe themselves in terms of roles, such as mum or housekeeper,
and the 'me' becomes submerged. A return to work is, for many women, a
re-emergence of 'me', as is divorce in some cases. As children leave home,
the rediscovery of 'me' will mean that, from an advertiser's point of view,
older women have more in common with young singles than traditional market
segmentation normally allows for.
And what exactly is this inner 'me' which women carry with them through
their lifestages? Its nature and complexity may surprise some marketers. For
example, one 45-year-old who would be viewed conventionally as the 'classic
housewife', described herself thus: 'Sexy me; successful me; childish me;
homely me; independent me; the lover in me; maternal me; nostalgic me.' Many
of the women with small children, for whom the 'me' was most suppressed,
expressed a desire to be 'wicked' or 'fiery', and most wanted to be rich and
admired.
The O&amp;M planners conclude that advertisers must understand that women cannot
be defined by their role or lifestage - the key to successful advertising is
accessing the many aspects of 'me'. Waiting to be tapped are:
The wild woman - outrageous, rebellious, sexy.
The wicked woman - manipulative, teasing.
The free woman - independent, happy, in control.
The woman on top - one upmanship, subverting expectations.
The funny woman - witty and amusing.
The return to childhood - fun, naughty.
The strong woman - coping, juggling, smiling.
The intelligent, creative woman - imaginative, talented.
The pampered woman - romantic, indulging, relaxed.
The voyeur - enjoying men's bodies.
Examples of the commercials which most appealed to women included a Nescafe
advertisement for cappuccino, which showed a group of young men setting up a
coffee bar on the beach to attract some passing young women - this appealed
to the romantic and nostalgic 'me' in all ages. A Kenco advertisement for
instant coffee, which has a coffee grower mistakenly assuming that the man,
rather than the woman, is the boss, appealed to the 'woman on top'. The
Gossard underwear 'lock up your sons' advertisements appealed to the 'wild
woman'.
Often the more overtly sexual commercials - for instance, some of the most
recent for Cadbury's Flake - were considered slightly embarrassing and were
liked less than those which aligned sensuality with beauty and stillness.
Predictably, advertisements for household cleaning products were among the
most irritating to women: the Daz washing powder commercials featuring
doorstep interviews were seen as patronising, dull and too ready to
categorise women as 'housewives'.
But, overall, the advertisements that women liked least, says O&amp;M researcher
Sarah Newman, were simply poorly made, boring and 'like wallpaper'.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): More than just a
pint and a packet of crisps - Britain's brewers are having to work harder to
maintain the pub's popularity
</HEADLINE>

The public house is still Britain's most popular social venue. A third of
adults visit a pub at least once a week. It is the first choice as a place
to meet friends, according to a recent Mori poll.
But brewers and independent pub operators are having to work harder to
maintain the pub's appeal and its place in the leisure industry during the
1990s.
The closure of an estimated 3,000 pubs since 1989 - and predictions that 10
per cent of the remaining 65,000 will go out of business by the end of the
decade - testify to the pressures.
The number of young people, the pub's traditional big spending customers, is
declining. Drinking habits are changing under the impact of healthier
lifestyles, drink-driving laws and shifting employment patterns.
There is more competition for leisure spending from restaurants and wine
bars, fast-food outlets and clubs. Home entertainment has grown with the
proliferation of television and videos.
'It is no longer enough just to open the pub doors,' says John McKeown,
retail services director at Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks group. 'You
have to offer much more than a drink to bring the customers inside.'
Exactly what can be done to satisfy the more demanding, value-conscious
consumers of the 1990s and improve the return on assets is an issue on which
pub operators are now concentrating their retail skills.
Allied, which earns an estimated 16 per cent of its profits from a
directly-managed estate of 2,500 pubs, believes it has found several equally
successful answers.
In an attempt to understand the demands of its varied customers, Allied
classified its pubs in the mid-1980s according to the community they served,
the dominant age and social class of customers, and their drinking habits.
Combined with the introduction of electronic point-of-sale systems, this
exercise enabled Allied to cater much more effectively to customer demands
in each market sector and to anticipate changing attitudes and values.
McKeown has no doubt about what is needed to maintain the pub's place as a
social centre. 'You have got to make a visit to the pub an occasion, provide
an enjoyable experience that will persuade customers to stay for a few
hours, and provide the reassurance of consistent quality that will bring
them back regularly,' he says.
Allied hopes to achieve these aims with three concepts, each designed to
meet the need of a different niche market. Two in particular are
transforming some of Allied's pubs most threatened with closure.
Under the first concept, the company is converting into Firkin outlets local
pubs which had little to offer their neighbourhood but convenience. Allied
extended the brand - originally developed by David Bruce, now a director of
Grosvenor Inns, the pub operator - after buying 14 of the pubs from Stakis,
the hotels and casinos group.
Firkin pubs appeal to young drinkers. They feature uncluttered floor space,
at least one large table that a dozen people can sit around, young staff -
and most of them have a micro-brewery in the cellar producing 10-12 barrels
a week of rich brews with names like Dog Bolter.
By the end of this year Allied will have 23 Firkins, and 53 by the end of
next year. Pubs that have already been converted - at an average cost of
Pounds 150,000 - have achieved up to a fivefold increase in turnover.
McKeown says: 'There is a limit to the development. If there were hundreds
of them, they would fail. One is enough in most university towns.'
Plans for Allied's second youth-appeal pub brand, Mr Q's, are more
ambitious. Pubs that have become stranded by population shifts, often on the
edge of 1930s housing estates, are being fitted with four or five pool
tables, a wall of screens for MTV and video juke boxes.
The number has been doubled in the past year to 161, and by next year there
will be 220 of them. 'Even if they did not sell more beer - and they do -
they would still be very successful,' McKeown claims.
Firkin and Mr Q's aim to buck the demographic and economic trends; but in
the third part of its pubs strategy, Allied is trying to consolidate its
position in the mainstream eating-out market for older couples and families.
Good value meals have become a much more important part of the pub's
offering during the recession. Allied now seeks to fill a niche between the
big pub-restaurant and the bar snacks trade with its Big Steak houses.
'A lot of people still feel uncomfortable in restaurants,' says McKeown.
'They don't like the ritual of ordering, and the waiters hovering around.'
So Big Steak incorporates a dining area in the pub and links its service to
the bar.
'It costs about Pounds 260,000 for a Big Steak conversion, 'but the
investment so far is showing very good returns, with food profits 35 per
cent ahead,' he says. The number of outlets has been increased from 170 to
232 in the past year.
Allied intends to manage its pub brands on the same lines as its retail
franchises, Dunkin Donuts and Baskin-Robbins. 'We shall set and maintain the
brand standards centrally,' says McKeown.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Heseltine pressed over Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Commons trade and industry committee yesterday criticised Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for failing to give the
Post Office more commercial freedom.
Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour chairman, said: 'To dismiss giving the Post
Office more commercialism is disgraceful. The committee believes the status
quo is the worst possible option.'
Mr Heseltine gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday and the MPs are
determined to keep up the pressure on the DTI to speed up its review into
the future of the corporation.
Mr Heseltine told the committee he favoured privatisation of the Royal Mail
letters division but had been prevented from changing its ownership because
of 'political considerations'. He said more commercialisation within the
public sector was proving very difficult to achieve.
A senior Conservative member of the committee said privately that he backed
the call for greater freedom within the public sector.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, accused the
DTI of 'damaging the business of the Post Office' by failing to make a
decision. He has written to Mr Heseltine urging him to give an early answer
on the future of the corporation and to recognise its need to work with the
private sector.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, agreed with Mr Heseltine's
view that there was a strong economic case for privatising the Royal Mail
while leaving Post Office shops in the public sector.
The Post Office revealed that the increase in the amount it has to give the
government was mainly responsible for November's price increase.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Treasury upbeat about economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday painted a upbeat picture of the economy, suggesting
that there will be no early cut in bank base rates from their present 5.5
per cent.
In its monthly monetary report prepared for yesterday's meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, the Treasury said that preliminary fourth- quarter gross domestic
product figures 'showed continuing steady growth in activity'.
Noting that the latest monthly indicators 'reinforce this picture of further
recovery', it said:
The trend in retail sales remains strongly upwards in spite of a slight
decline in December that may have reflected seasonal adjustment problems.
Manufacturing output rose further in November.
Business optimism, as measured by the latest CBI survey, showed a very
strong rise.
Unemployment fell sharply again in December.
The report gave a generally favourable account of price trends in Britain
but contained some warning signals, noting that growth in manufacturers'
unit wage costs remained low 'but is no longer negative'.
Underlying retail price inflation, at 2.7 per cent in December, was at its
second lowest rate since January 1968 after a rise in the month that
reflected the Budget increase in excise duties. However, although the
underlying rate was 0.8 percentage points below the latest average
'headline' inflation rate for the European Union, it was 0.2 points above
the average for the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, the
Treasury said.
Meanwhile, the UK's official reserves rose by Dollars 521m (Pounds 347.3m)
in January, or by Dollars 205m on an underlying basis. The increase was
greater than expected.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Smithfield demands rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Corporation of London yesterday rejected demands for extra subsidies for
Smithfield meat market and announced that it would end negotiations with the
Smithfield Market Tenants' Association.
Smithfield and the corporation are in dispute over how the Pounds 60m
refurbishment of the market to meet European Union regulations should be
funded. Two members of the association have been elected to the
corporation's general council as part of its campaign against rent rises of
between 85 per cent and 135 per cent.
Mr Jack Neary, the corporation's central markets chairman, said: 'The
tenants' negotiators are seeking to have new premises provided by the
corporation at what seems to be little or no increase in cost to them.
'Recent discussions illustrate . . . that they are not prepared to accept
the realities of the situation, so no meaningful progress is possible.'

FT  03 FEB 94 / Halifax records blip in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices fell 0.4 per cent last month compared with December,
emphasising the fragility of the housing market recovery, Halifax, Britain's
biggest mortgage lender, said yesterday.
The building society said tax increases announced in the November Budget may
have weakened confidence in the housing market, which had been recovering.
The latest decline follows a 0.6 per cent fall reported for December.
Nationwide, Britain's second largest building society, on Tuesday produced
figures showing that prices rose on average by 0.4 per cent in January.
Mr Gary Marsh, head of research at Halifax, said he was slightly surprised
by the fall in prices which came when it was thought that the market had
stabilised.
December and January were normally very weak months. 'We will be looking at
the next two or three months with some interest,' said Mr Marsh.
Halifax, which had warned that occasional monthly price falls would occur,
believed nevertheless that the housing market recovery would continue.
It said: 'Despite this pronounced seasonal weakness in house prices, overall
activity in the market, as reported by the Inland Revenue, continues to show
signs of picking up. We remain confident that as more general signs of
economic recovery become more apparent, then house prices will resume their
gradual upward course.'
Halifax and Nationwide both expect prices to rise by about 5 per cent on
average this year. Some of the monthly discrepancies between the societies'
figures may be explained by the fact that Nationwide uses a smaller sample
of borrowers, while Halifax seasonally adjusts its figures.
According to Halifax the average price of a home in the UK rose by 1.1 per
cent to Pounds 61,133 during the 12 months to the end of January. Nationwide
reported a 2.4 per cent rise to Pounds 53,763 for the same period.
Halifax said that the price of new homes, after falling in December,
increased by 0.8 per cent in January, resulting in a rise of 0.3 per cent
over the preceding 12 months.
Instead of raising prices, builders have been eroding some of the sales
incentives such as subsidised loans and moving expenses which had been
offered during the recession, and which helped reduce profit margins.

Around 20 Labour backbenchers ignored the official party line to abstain and
joined with Liberal Democrat MPs in voting against regulations embodying

enough.
The regulations were approved by a government majority of 218 (364-46).

FT  03 FEB 94 / Labour refuses to debate Clause 4
</HEADLINE>

   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour Leadership yesterday dismissed Mr Neil Kinnock's call to drop
Clause 4 of its constitution as 'a massive distraction' from winning
elections, Roland Rudd writes.
The former Labour leader said he wanted the controversial clause -
committing the party to nationalisation - to be replaced. He argued that the
clause was not an adequate definition of modern socialism, which should be
concerned with individual liberty.
The Labour leadership said it had no intention of 'opening up another flank'
in the run-up to the local and European elections by taking part in a debate
which could prove distracting.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Move on account loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants in business will be obliged under guidelines issued yesterday to
discourage fellow directors and officers from using 'creative accounting'
loopholes.
The onus will be on all members of any of the six leading professional
accountancy bodies in the UK to pass on the pronouncements from the
urgent-issues taskforce of the Accounting Standards Board.
The details are included as part of the foreword to urgent-issues taskforce
abstracts, issued by the board yesterday.
The taskforce is designed to prevent what Mr David Tweedie, board chairman,
calls 'the creeping crumple' - the process by which auditors were in the
past coerced into allowing clients to exploit creative accounting loopholes
because other firms of auditors had already approved the accounting
technique in another company.
The taskforce was set up as part of the new machinery for financial
reporting created under the 1989 Companies Act.
The foreword states that the Accounting Standards Board has the right to
reject any statement issued by the taskforce if it contradicts legislation
or the direction of financial reporting being taken by the board.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Tenant safeguard measures urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenants should have greater protection from eviction, the Law Commission
said yesterday. The proposal was among a number of suggestions for reform of
the law on termination on tenancies put forward by the government's law
reform body.
The commission said the 'complex, confused and defective' law needed urgent
reform. Parts of the law date back 150 years.
It recommends that a landlord should not be allowed to take a property back
without a court order or the tenant's agreement if the tenant is in default
for non-payment of rent or for breach of some other obligation in a lease.
Landlords have the right in some cases now simply to repossess the property
 -a right of 'peaceable re-entry' described by a law lord recently as
'dangerous'.
The commission also proposes that courts should be able to give tenants the
chance to save their tenancies by taking appropriate remedial action, and
that there should be a single set of rules governing the landlord's right of
forfeiture. At the moment there are different rules depending on whether
forfeiture is as a result of non-payment of rent or other defaults.
The commission recommends that a landlord should be required to give
preliminary notice of forfeiture only when a tenant has failed to comply
with an obligation to repair the property. Landlords would lose the right of
forfeiture only if, knowing the facts, they behaved in a way which would
lead a reasonable tenant to believe they did not intend to end the lease. At
present a landlord can lose the right by merely sending a rent demand.
These reforms, which would apply to all types of leases were first put
forward by the commission in 1985. They have been re-submitted together with
a draft bill.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Chevron to cut N Sea workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chevron UK is to reduce its workforce in the Ninian oil field 100 miles east
of Shetland by 25 per cent as part of a wide-ranging reform of offshore
manning levels and working practices. About 60 jobs will go - either through
early retirement or redundancy.
The shift pattern of 14 days on and 14 days off will be changed to a
21/21-day system, which will save Pounds 1m from Ninian's estimated
operating expenses for this year of Pounds 85m.
The company said the changes had been under consideration for some time, but
the 20 per cent fall in oil prices over the past year had caused North Sea
operators to seek additional savings. The lower staffing was made possible
by combining some jobs, and should not affect safety.
Contractors have often worked 21/21-day shifts, but Ninian will be the first
North Sea platform where operator staff are on such a system.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Accountants told to police loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants in business will be obliged to discourage fellow directors and
officers from using 'creative accounting' loopholes under guidelines issued
yesterday.
The onus will be on all members of any of the six leading professional
accountancy bodies in the UK to pass on the pronouncements from the
urgent-issues taskforce of the Accounting Standards Board.
The details are included as part of the foreword to urgent-issues taskforce
abstracts, issued by the board yesterday.
The taskforce is designed to prevent what Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the
board, calls 'the creeping crumple' - the process by which auditors were in
the past coerced into allowing clients to exploit creative accounting
loopholes because other firms of auditors had already approved the
accounting technique being used in another company.
The taskforce, modelled on a similar body in the USA, was set up as part of
the new machinery for financial reporting created under the 1989 companies
act.
The foreword explains its structure, and stresses that a maximum of two of
the sixteen 16 members of the taskforce can vote against a proposal if it is
to be approved.
The foreword states that the Accounting Standards Board has the right to
reject any statement issued by the taskforce if it contradicts legislation
or the direction of financial reporting being taken by the board.
The foreword stresses that companies are required to obey the spirit and not
just the letter of documents issued by the taskforce.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Traffic levels 'pose benzene pollution threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising traffic levels threaten to lead to harmful levels of benzene in the
air, a government panel of scientists warned yesterday.
Fitting catalytic converters to more cars and improving public transport
would help, the scientists said.
The report by the expert panel on air quality standards, set up two years
ago after the 1990 white paper on the environment, recommends that levels of
benzene in the air should not exceed 5ppb - parts per billion - calculated
as a running annual average.
It also recommends that the standard eventually be reduced to 1ppb and that
the government set a target date for achieving this.
Professor Anthony Seaton of Aberdeen University, chairman of the panel, said
that the 5ppb standard 'would broadly be able to be met at present', but
1ppb would be more difficult.
Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, said the government would soon
publish a consultation paper on how the standards should be applied.
Evidence indicating that benzene causes a form of leukaemia has been
accumulating for some 15 years. The World Health Organisation has not
recommended standards, saying there is no completely 'safe' level for such
chemicals.
However, the panel said yesterday that at the levels it has recommended,
'the risks are exceedingly small and unlikely to be detectable by any
practicable method'.
Smoking 20 cigarettes a day more than doubles the exposure to benzene for
someone living in a town.
Nearly 80 per cent of benzene in the air comes from petrol cars. Since the
start of last year, all new cars have been fitted with catalytic converters
which reduce these emissions almost entirely.
Diesel engines emit only 9 per cent of airborne benzene, but they also emit
harmful carbon particles, as a government report last week warned. Petrol
pumps emit a small amount, and food and water also contain traces, the panel
said.
The panel will publish further recommendations on levels of other
pollutants, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
ozone and carbon particles.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday attacked the
government's promotion of unleaded fuel, which contains much more benzene
than leaded fuel. Cars with catalytic converters need unleaded fuel but emit
little benzene; cars which run on unleaded but have no converters emit high
levels.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Consumer credit shows 36 per cent increase: Confidence
stimulated by lower interest rates and receding fear of unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer credit in December was 36 per cent higher than in December 1992,
the Finance &amp; Leasing Association said yesterday. The figures indicate that
consumer confidence has revived as interest rates and the fear of
unemployment have declined.
The association, which represents companies providing consumer credit,
business finance and leasing, and motor finance, said it was surprised by
the weak trend in official retail sales figures for December. Those showed a
seasonally adjusted fall of 0.2 per cent from November and an annual rise of
just 4 per cent.
However, the credit figures may indicate that consumers are increasingly
turning to store cards or hire purchase to buy goods, rather than using
cash. Motor finance figures were particularly strong, showing a 45 per cent
rise between December 1992 and last December.
The FLA said companies were starting to upgrade their car fleets, having
postponed such expenditure during the recession. Mr Tony Mallin, FLA
chairman, said April's tax rises would stretch consumers' cashflow and the
growth of retail sales would slow down.
Official figures for December consumer credit - which, unlike the FLA
figures, include bank credit cards - will be published on Monday.
Business finance figures were less strong, increasing by 13 per cent between
December 1992 and December 1993.
Mr Mallin said: 'We would expect the improvement in industrial investment to
lag behind consumer credit as we come out of recession, and our figures
reflect this. All the indications are that companies are now beginning to
invest in new plant and machinery.'

FT  03 FEB 94 / Rise in official reserves prompts sales speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's official reserves rose by Dollars 521m in January, or by Dollars
205m on an underlying basis.
The larger-than-expected increase prompted some speculation in the markets
that the Bank of England had been selling pounds in order to counter the
strength of sterling.
However, intervention on such a small scale would have had little effect on
the pound's value, given that much larger sales of foreign currency failed
to prevent sterling's devaluation in September 1992.
The overall level of reserves at end-January was Dollars 43,447m, or Pounds
28,983m at the January 31 exchange rate. The underlying change excludes
factors such as dealings with the European Monetary Co-operation Fund, which
accounted for Dollars 298m of the rise.
The government continued to repay the revolving credit facility it took out
to help defend the pound when sterling was in the European exchange rate
mechanism. Just under Pounds 1.17bn of the facility was repaid in January.

FT  03 FEB 94 / A nation of highly profitable shopkeepers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British retailers appear more vulnerable than many European counterparts to
the growth of cross-border competition in the industry and may be less
well-placed to expand into continental markets, says a study by the Oxford
Institute of Retail Management, Guy de Jonquieres writes.
The Europe-wide survey of retailers' financial performance finds that though
British retailers generate exceptionally high sales and profits from their
shelf space - most carry fewer days' stock than continental counterparts -
they are much less efficient in their use of assets and labour.
The institute suggests that UK retailers' high profits may mask inefficient
personnel management. In a comparison of sales per employee in 1992-93 among
almost 50 European retailers, Kwik Save, the best-performing British group,
ranks tenth and Marks &amp; Spencer twelfth, while 11 of the 15 chains at the
bottom of the list are British.
'One possible conclusion is that UK profit margins are good, but the ability
of UK retailers to work their assets is well below that displayed by other
European companies,' the study says. 'Questions might be posed as to how
well equipped UK companies are to meet fierce margin competition.'
The three worst performers, Boots, Burton and Sears, have sales per employee
roughly one-eighth those of Kesko of Finland, the highest-ranked European
retailer.
Seven of the 10 European companies generating the highest profits and sales
per square metre of store space are British. However, the study says UK
retailers may have less growth potential than their continental competitors
because of the difficulty in earning profits elsewhere in Europe that
compare with those in their home market.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Health chief quits in Brazil trip row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director of Health Promotion Wales, a government-funded body, resigned
last night after Labour alleged he had claimed fraudulent expenses for
foreign travel, Roland Adburgham writes.
Professor John Catford was accused under parliamentary privilege by Mr
Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West and a Labour frontbench spokesman on
Wales, of taking a trip to Brazil for personal reasons. Mr Morgan said: 'It
is yet another unacceptable face of Welsh quangoland.'
The professor, who had been executive director of the body since 1987, also
resigned from the chair of health promotion and education at the University
of Wales. Last night, he said his resignations were because a 'silly and
regrettable' affair with a female colleague while on a professional trip to
Brazil, had become public knowledge. 'There was no abuse of public funds,'
he said.
