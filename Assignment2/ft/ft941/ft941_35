FT  29 JAN 94 / Fashion: How to survive as a couturier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1 Set or confirm trends.
This spring, these are:
a) short fluid skirts under long fluid jackets, in pale tweed (Chanel) or
pale crepe and lace (Valentino).
b) short, metallic and modern (Versace).
c) short, elaborate and historic (Lacroix).
d) tiny, short jackets with very wide trousers (Chanel, Lacroix, Dior).
e) chiffon for evening: short layers (Chanel), long layers (Ungaro), high
waists (Lacroix).
f) new tights - black lace, silver metallic or glossy sheer.
2 Achieve wonderful, wearable tailoring (St Laurent, Dior, Givenchy,
Balmain).
3 Make very grand but not extreme evening gowns (St Laurent, Balmain,
Ricci).
4 As white is THE colour, use masses of white or cream evening dresses which
could also be wedding gowns, the couturier's lifeline (all designers).
5 Add some Eastern promise gold-beaded chiffon tunics and pants,
particularly for the Arab and Asian markets (Scherrer, Ungaro).
6 Grab the headlines, with:
a) strategic transparency (Chanel, Scherrer, Ricci).
b) a controversy - Chanel's surreal feather helmets which obscured both
supermodel faces and some good clothes, or Lacroix putting
Directoire-inspired dresses on a suedehead model.
7 Launch a potentially lucrative perfume this season (Scherrer, Dior,
Ungaro).

FT  29 JAN 94 / Fashion: Haute couture - the editors have their say - Are
designer clothes worth the expense? As the spring shows are unveiled, Avril
Groom seeks the commentators' views on the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The press has been writing off couture for the past decade, declaring its
style and prices irrelevant to modern life. Last week this gilded-salon
industry had a chance to prove it still has a role when it unveiled its
spring shows.
For their views on the role and future of haute couture, I asked the fashion
professionals, the top international editors whose job it is to look, assess
and and write about the designers and their offerings? Here a small group of
editors is interviewed on the role and future of couture. They were asked
which designers and ideas are important, and which are their personal
favourites.
Most, as you can see from the sketches below, prefer to wear black clothes,
at least during the day. And they all agree that the benefits of dressing
well more than justify the cost.
Janie Samet, fashion editor, Le Figaro:
Couture is about research and imagination, not commercial trends. If it
looks like ready-to-wear it is against the spirit. Couture should be good
for the morale. Jacques Lang, the French minister of culture, wants to
protect couture as a unique craft metier. Designers: Chanel's clothes for
modern women, Ungaro's fabrics and Lacroix's fantasy. Ideas: pastels, white
and the move away from grunge. Choice: St Laurent's and Balmain's tailoring
and I am fascinated by Ungaro.
Jackie Modlinger, fashion director, Daily Express:
Couture represents the past and a dying lifestyle. Trends come from
ready-to-wear but media demand for the fantasy created by couture shows is
insatiable and the houses need the publicity. Accessory ideas from shows
often take off. Designers: Lacroix, Versace, Chanel. Idea: Directoire
dresses, short skirts, high heels, lacy or silver tights. Choice: a St
Laurent 'smoking', a Lacroix black lace dress and a Dior frockcoat.
Alexandra Shulman, editor, British Vogue:
Designers develop technically and without restraint in couture which is
where ideas germinate. But it is having to change and there is now a
blurring with top ready-to-wear. Versace's couture can be ordered through
some of his shops. Designers: Versace's modernity, Valentino's influential
wearability. Ideas: softer tailoring, layers, short skirts, metallics.
Choice: a very simple day-suit from one of a number of designers.
Suzy Menkes, fashion editor, International Herald Tribune:
For a great designer couture is not just a private fantasy but expresses the
artistic soul in a way impossible for ready-to-wear because of the
tremendous craftsmanship involved. Most exciting fabric innovations start in
couture. Designers: Lacroix - very strong, the intricate work almost
magical. Chanel - Lagerfeld goes back to suits and clever cocktail frocks
that clients love. Valentino - wonderful lightness of hand. Ideas: a wave of
prettiness. Choice: I do not view fashion personally.
Franca Sozzani, editor, Italian Vogue:
Couture gives a designer the freedom to use his imagination, to reveal his
dream in the form of a show. Designers: Lacroix is witty and unexpected,
Lagerfeld is a huge influence and Versace is making couture modern. Ideas:
pastels and pleats. Choice: the new romantic femininity but an individual
mix from different designers.
Anna Wintour, editor, American Vogue:
Couture means the luxury to experiment. Wearability is not the point but
certain ideas filter through. The monastic, avant-garde look of
ready-to-wear was needed as an antidote to 1980s style but couture has
brought us this soft, sexy femininity which is exactly where fashion should
be now.
Designers: Lagerfeld, Versace, Lacroix.
Ideas: long jackets, short soft skirts, higher heels, metallic fabrics under
sheers.
Choice: the above ideas, from various designers.
Bernardine Morris, chief fashion critic, New York Times.
Cardin's solution to the future is to show once a year as business is so
global he has to cover two seasons at once. That would cut the costs but
also the publicity, and ideas from designers such as Versace end up in the
high street very fast. For others, such as Ungaro, couture is for fabric
research. Designers: Versace - impressive and modern, Chanel - wearable
suits for real life, Lacroix - marvellous craftsmanship. Choice: Wear any of
it - no]
Andrea Manet von Scheidlin, Paris editor, Textil-Wirtschaft:
Paris is a sorcerer's kettle for fabric research. Shows and publicity are
essential to help designers sign lucrative licensing deals. Advertising
would cost far more. Designers: Lagerfeld, for innovative fabrics and ideas,
St Laurent for real clothes. Ideas: pastels and metallics, asymmetric
transparency, the lingerie look. Choice: I am neither slim nor young, so
Givenchy - wearable and perfectly cut.

FT  29 JAN 94 / How to Spend It: Minimalism in the bath-tub - Lucia van der
Post taps into the latest in bathroom design and fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Home in Three Days. Don't Wash.'
These were Napoleon's orders to Josephine as he sent her a message that he
was on his way back from the front. In his time, it seems, a taste for women
au naturel was not at all unusual.
Today the fashion for the daily bath, for cleanliness and the banishing of
body odours permeates our culture.
There is scarcely a western house without at least one bathroom and in
prosperous circles two, three and four are not uncommon. Those of a
reflective cast of mind are inclined to invest bathing with mystical
significance, seeing it as a domestic version of ancient purifactory rites.
Certainly, it is true that bathing the world over has always been connected
with motives other than simple cleanliness.
In these secular times pleasure is the over-riding aim and, for years,
modern design reflected this.
Just as minimalism and a sense of simple quality has taken over in other
rooms of the house, so it has begun to reach the bathroom. Take the one
photographed here (top).
Designed for a successful city banker - a bachelor - the brief to Simply
Bathrooms, which created the room for him, was for comfort, quality and
simplicity. The owner wanted the maximum luxury and the best quality shower,
bath and fittings. He also wanted the overall look to be as simple and stark
as possible. He wanted the tranquility of a Japanese bathhouse without a
frill or a hint of excess.
The heart of the bathroom, and the reason for its owner's intense
satisfaction, depends on the quality of the fittings. He wanted a shower and
Simply Bathrooms selected Showerlux, a German make, because, although many
showers would meet his technical requirements, that one also met his visual
needs.
The cubicle is made of curved glass which is elegant and much less visually
intrusive than any others
It arrives as a complete unit (a central upright pole which houses the
controls is integrated into the glass) which means there is very little for
even the most ham-fisted plumber to screw up. Its disadvantage is that being
free-standing it does need quite a lot of space. There is an even more
beautiful and luxurious model - which requires yet more space - which looks
like a stunning transparent snail.
The bath is high-quality acrylic, as plain as could be, with a built-in
whirlpool to enable its owner to relax in the city. The total cost of
equipment and installation came out at just under Pounds 10,000.
Anyone who has had a go at transforming or installing a bathroom will know
that one of the big difficulties is that at the top end of the market in
specialist products for the bathroom, 10 different suppliers might be
involved - with possible long waits for delivery men who turn up just when
you have given up on them and gone out.
Patrick Riley, managing director of Simply Bathrooms, decided that one of
the keys to running a successful bathroom business had to be in providing
better service.
He, therefore, set about developing a system to co-ordinate deliveries so
that every component would arrive on the same day. Some 70 per cent of the
equipment he sells he keeps in stock, the rest has to be ordered. He
delivers it all together.
The bathroom photographed here, for instance, was installed in a week,
resulting in minimal disruption to the owner's domestic life.
Anyone interested in the service can ring 081-665-0066 for a brochure (which
is filled with information, planning aids, design suggestions, points to
look out for) or visit the showrooms at 28 Rushgrove Avenue, Colindale,
London, NW9 6QS or 2 Bensham Lane, Croydon, Surrey.
For those who are brave enough to think of renovating or building a bathroom
from scratch themselves, Terence Conran's Do-It-Yourself book (Conran
Octopus, Pounds 14.99, 254 pages) has two suitably pared-down bathroom
projects which are described in detail.
The one photographed (left) is a light, panelled room which uses painted
tongue-and-groove pine boarding to hide the pipework.
Besides being visually appealing the tongue-and-groove boarding may be
mounted on a batten frame to create an access panel which can be easily
removed if (as they surely will) plumbing problems arise.
The whole effect is redolent of cool, New England chic.
The second bathroom which might be useful to those looking for inspiration
is a clean-lined tiled bath shower and basin unit. The result looks sleek,
restfully uncluttered and easy to clean.
Here at last are designs to inspire. For too long most do-it-yourself
manuals have been high on expertise and technical information but low on
elan.
Terence Conran's book, as you might expect from such a designer, focuses on
30 different projects, each one of which is thoroughly in tune with
1990s-style simplicity.
Besides the bathrooms there is a great deal else of interest to those who
who feel comfortable with the mysterious world of Do-It-Yourself.
There is a pared-down, elegant solution to the problem of providing shelves
and cupboards in an alcove.
There is a baby's crib, a rocking chair, a wall of display shelving and,
possibly my favourite design of all, a Japanese wardrobe which is all sleek
panels and sliding screens, light years removed from the embellished
built-in systems which do-it-yourselfers are usually encouraged to embark
on.
Perhaps some of the most useful designs are those for the garden - a tree
seat, a plain as plain garden bench, a walk-through pergola and, most
ambitious of all, a summer house.
I have no ambitions in the DIY area myself so am unable to judge how easy
the instructions are to follow but there are intricate-looking drawings,
comprehensive lists of the materials and tools required and the quality of
the photography and drawings make even me think that maybe one day I too
might just have a go with the Black &amp; Decker.

FT  29 JAN 94 / How to Spend It: You simply must discover the right niche -
Mail-order catalogues are no longer needed just for bringing boring
essentials into your home - these days even the most quirky commodities can
be bought by post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Inessential shopping is bliss', says the actress Joan Collins in My
Secrets. I am with her.
What more delightful way to spend the day in central London than with a
visit to Joseph and on to Harvey Nichols followed by a snack at Joe's Cafe
and sharing some chit-chat with your best friend?
It is the essential shopping that gets one down. The search for a giant pack
of washing-powder, bottles of mineral water . . . these are not the stuff of
exciting sorties. It is for purchases such as these that mail-order was
tailor-made.
But the truly surprising thing is that mail-order is no longer used just for
bringing most of life's more boring essentials to the door - these days even
life's most inessential quirky commodities can be bought by post.
Almost every month brings yet another catalogue carefully aimed at some
newly-identified slice of the market. These are known as niche catalogues
and whether you are looking for an exclusive fishing rod, some vintage
clothing or a fine string of pearls, someone, somewhere will bring it to
you.
Newest of them is Sam Walker. Those who are familiar with the shop at 41
Neal Street, Covent Garden, will know it as a purveyor of highly desirable
vintage clothing. There are summer linen jackets to conjure up summer days
on the village green, Chesterfield coats that Noel Coward might have worn,
snap-brimmed felt hats straight from Brief Encounter.
As the vogue for vintage clothing grew, somehow Sam Walker seemed able to
keep tabs on sources and now he has launched a mail order service which
offers a combination of old clothing - reconditioned, of course - and some
special Sam Walker brands that are made today in the mood and style of times
gone by.
The catalogue looks as if has been found in some dusty, pre-war attic. The
graphic style is almost pure Boys' Own. There are plus-fours straight from a
1920s golf course (from Pounds 25), tweed and corduroy jackets (Pounds 49),
four-quarter tweed caps (Pounds 25) and slightly caddish striped linen
summer blazers (Pounds 195).
Sam Walker's own branded shoes, all in impeccably nostalgic mood, range from
Wingtip Brogues (Pounds 65) to Chukka Boots (Pounds 75) and cricket shoes
(Pounds 65).
An authentic all-purpose Gloverall duffle coat - remember Jack Hawkins in
The Cruel Sea? - in navy, tan, bottle green, black or cranberry red ranges
from Pounds 109 to Pounds 125, depending on size. There is also a range of
Aero leatherwear - Charles Lindbergh-style, Long-shoreman and cyclists'
jackets and proper jackets.
Nostalgic man, of course, requires nostalgic accessories and Sam Walker
provides them - fogeyish waistcoats, pocket watches, wristwatches (in
particular there is a sturdily plain and elegant Tali wristwatch based on a
1920s design for Pounds 49.95), braces, sunglasses (all based on 1920s, 30s,
40s and 50s styles) and cufflinks.
Telephone 071-240-7800 for a free catalogue.
Racing Green has grown and grown since last I mentioned it. Besides the new
store at 193-197 Regent Street, London W1, where all those who like to see
their merchandise before they write the cheque can browse, there is a new,
expanded catalogue.
Those who had a disappointing experience with Racing Green in its early days
might like to know that it was originally overwhelmed by its success and had
trouble keeping up with orders.
Now there is a new warehouse and a computerised stock system which seems to
function well.
The spring catalogue has been launched (ring 0345-331177 for a free copy)
and all the old favourite are there - the button-down poplin shirts (Pounds
27), the city top (Pounds 19) in lots of new colours, cotton twill shorts
for men and women (Pounds 25) and in good safari colours for Africa lovers,
the T-shirts (Pounds 11) in masses of colours.
There is a lot that is new, too - a simple summer cotton dress in mole,
burnt orange or china blue as well as chambray (Pounds 35), a blue and white
checked or striped jean shirt for men (Pounds 35), a soft linen trouser suit
for women (Pounds 99 for the blazer, Pounds 49 for the trousers) and some
good cotton rib basics that could double as underwear or outerwear.
Myko is a new name to mail order and it seems to have defined as its niche
the minimalist, pared-down look. Beautifully photographed with a slim,
carefully-edited selection of what it calls 'body basics' it could be the
answer to clothing needs of the health club, gym, fitness addict, as well as
those who just like lounging around in comfort. It is designed, too, to
appeal to the minimalist travellers.
Those whose natural instincts lead them more to the baroque school of
travelling may find it a little too pared-down for their more fulsome needs
but they are easy to pack and being of a limited colour palette (mainly
cream, white or black) everything will work with everything else, making up
a small capsule wardrobe.
There is a linen collection of palazzo pants (Pounds 34.99), puff-sleeve
body (Pounds 24.99), micro-shorts (Pounds 14.99) and sleeveless vest (Pounds
14.99). Then there is a linen tube dress (not easy to wear unless you are
young, slim and beautiful but then that is presumably the point of all that
gym-going) and a collection of micro-shorts and leggings, fitness bras and
leotards for the the fitness enthus-iast.
Prices are extremely good - there is nothing more than Pounds 39.99 (ring
0764-679479 for a copy of the catalogue).
Many of you will be familiar with Brooks Brothers clothing. Much of it is
loved the world over but certain items have a cult following and those whose
sartorial identity is dependent on them cannot always rely on getting to
America often enough to satisfy their needs.
Smart Italian bankers in London, for instance, who feel inadequately dressed
unless they are sporting soft Supima button-down shirts or, off-duty, pure
cashmere cardigans and twill sports shirts - often pinched by their
girlfriends - have discovered the ease with which they can shop for these
essentials by mail. Simply ring (908) 225-4860 between 8.30am and 4.30pm
(New York time) or fax (908) 225-1520 for a free copy of the catalogue.
The company will deliver almost anywhere in the world and the prices are
listed clearly and concisely. But, for the fisherman's hat in beige, trimmed
with a fine blue and Bordeaux stripe, which the same Italian bankers
consider de rigueur for weekending in Chelsea - baseball caps are totally
demode - only a visit to the US will do.
Good to know some things still reward a little effort.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Time for Michelin to think again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Memo: to the Rt Hon John Major MP, the Rt Hon John Smith MP and Mrs Stella
Rimmington, head of MI5.
Concerned about security? Worried about those embarrassing leaks to the
Press? Allow a humble restaurant correspondent to offer a solution.
Consult Derek Brown, editor of the Michelin Guide to Great Britain and
Ireland since its inception 21 years ago.
He is the man who has, without a single security lapse, just bestowed the
coveted stars and Red Meal symbols on 133 dining rooms and supervised the
entries on a total of 4,625 hotels and 1,085 restaurants in the 1994 guide
(Pounds 10.95).
Keeping such secrets has not been easy. In a rare interview Brown admitted
that for the past three weeks he, his team of nine inspectors and his Press
Office, had been continually questioned by chefs, restaurateurs and the
national and catering press as to who would be promoted, demoted or even
dropped completely. Not a word had got out.
During the course of a year his team travels for 10 months, eats out twice a
day and sleeps in a wide variety of hotels (I asked for figures on total
annual expenditure but this proved a secret that he would not divulge). In
most cases the inspectors introduce themselves after the meal, talk to the
chef or proprietor and inspect the kitchen.
A dirty kitchen is an immediate disqualification, as is an over-dependence
on the deep freeze - happily, Brown stressed, almost a thing of the past.
Using this type of continuous assessment, Michelin's inspectors build up a
rapport with the British hospitality industry which Brown insists is
safeguarded.
The team hears trade and family gossip - in one case an inspector was told
that the chef planned to divorce his wife and sell the restaurant even
before the wife knew of his plans - and keeping these sources of information
private is essential for the guide's future.
Brown described the Michelin Guide as having been conceived as a 'simple
book to help people to get around'. He cited the example of a couple who
arrived in Lincoln and who needed to find a room and a restaurant that would
meet their requirements but not stretch their wallets. Michelin's annual
sales of 80,000 copies for its UK edition worldwide proves that it achieves
this ambition.
The Michelin guide to the UK stands as a sister volume to its six other
European guides. Brown is at pains to stress his and the guide's
independence. He travels to France frequently to eat and keep abreast of
culinary trends rather visit Michelin's headquarters in Paris.
Although Michelin has bestowed its stars since 1974 I am sure it did not
anticipate the tears and the financial success or failure which they would
generate.
This week, at a lunch at Leith's, in west London, before 15 selected food
writers, Brown made a short speech in which he stressed that the most
satisfying professional element in his years as editor has not been the
drama over who gets how many stars but the large increase in the number of
entries, from 3,000 to 5,700, and the sharp rise in the overall quality of
food and service. Unfortunately, Michelin's policy of not including an
introduction to its guide means such facts are not often publicly
proclaimed.
And serious question marks can be raised against the validity of some
awards. Does, for example, Marco Pierre White at the Hyde Park Hotel in
Knightsbridge, deserve two stars when, twice to my knowledge, he has asked
paying customers to leave his restaurant because they dared to complain
about the food?
It is also surprising to see the award of a star to the Grill Room at the
Cafe Royal, London W10 and even more so to one for The Canteen in SW10. And
does Leith's, which served a decidedly unbalanced meal for the guide's
launch, also deserve a star?
Elsewhere in the capital, there is still only limited recognition for
talented Simon Hopkinson at Bibendum, in Michelin House, Fulham Road, SW3
and Alastair Little of Frith Street, W1. There is also a large number of
'ethnic restaurants' which perhaps deserve more recognition. And I also feel
that still not enough importance is given by Michelin to the price/quality
ratio, an essential ingredient for any service industry in the 1990s.
Brown endured criticism of this nature from a fellow restaurant reviewer
throughout the lunch and then, when they parted, admitted that they had had
the same dispute for the past 20 years. So long as the star system prevails
there are bound to be such arguments, particularly when other restaurant
reviewers feel they can do the job better and chefs feel their hard work and
dedication is under-appreciated.
I feel the needs of the Michelin Guide reader would be better served if it
reverted to its original remit, to be a 'simple book to help people get
around'.
Isn't it time for a complete overhaul of the system, for a recognition that
culinary stars, like so many trappings of the 1970s and 1980s, are no longer
valid?
A restaurateur who had held, lost and then regained his Michelin star
agreed. Michelin provided 1.3 per cent of his business, regular clients 50
per cent. His recommendation to any aspiring restaurateur is to forget the
glory and go for the regulars.
Yours sincerely, Nicholas Lander

FT  29 JAN 94 / Cookery: Extracting the right recipe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dental trouble has plagued my household recently. Indeed, my husband has
lost three teeth in as many months. The fight to save them was long and
valiant. He has endured many waiting rooms in the company of old Country
Life magazines, not to mention throbbing, anaesthetised jaws and the
constant, chilling sound of drills.
My instinct was to nurse him through the crisis with invalid or baby foods.
I banned from my menus any potentially perilous nuts, grains and spicy
seeds, or crunchy apples and other fresh fruits that might add to the
problems. Instead, we re-entered the bland gastronomic world of the nursery.
Those who went to public schools are said to retain a fondness for nursery
food all their lives. In practice, though, there is a limit to how long
adults with educated palates can endure a daily diet of porridge, baked
eggs, fish and shepherds' pies, custard, rice pudding, apple snow and bread
and butter pudding.
The breakthrough came when I realised that easy-to-eat foods need not be so
nannyish or insular. More sophisticated and international options deserved
consideration. Little tooth fairy treats began to appear at meal-times and
the patient perked up.
Oeufs soubise replaced scrambled eggs. Instead of steamed cod, there were
mousselines or quenelles of salmon, pike or scallops. There was guacamole;
steamed meatballs with coriander raita and dahl; and oeufs a la neige with
mango instead of baked apple.
Particularly pleasing were the de luxe offerings that punctuated the
pain-ridden weeks: caviare, foie gras and oysters. Admittedly, though, this
was luxury indulgence. So here are a few more modest suggestions.
AUBERGINE CAVIARE
Teasingly named, this consists of small aubergines pricked and cooked under
the grill until the flesh feels very soft under the blackened and blistered
skins. Strip off the skins and squeeze some of the juices from the flesh
(Dutch-grown aubergines can be wringing wet). Tear the flesh to shreds with
forks, or puree it in a food processor or blender, adding a sliver of
crushed garlic for every pound of aubergine.
Season lightly, beat in a few spoonfuls of olive oil and a good splash of
lemon juice, and scatter with chopped flat-leafed parsley or coriander.
MUSHROOM CAVIARE
This is as dark and rich as aubergine caviare is delicate and light.
Soften a small, very finely-chopped onion in plenty of butter until it is
meltingly tender. Chop roughly about  3/4 lb flat mushrooms, discarding the
stalks, and saute briskly until most of their moisture is driven off.
Mix the vegetables, splash them with marsala (or madeira or port) and season
well with salt, pepper, toasted and powdered cumin and coriander seed. Add a
shake of cayenne.
When cool but not cold, process briefly to a grey-flecked mixture that a
blind man might mistake for caviare, adding extra butter gradually (at room
temperature and diced).
When the texture is creamy - I allow one part butter to two or three parts
mushroom - check seasoning and pot.
POTTED SALMON WITH DILL &amp; LIME
Season and wrap a piece of salmon in buttered foil with a sprig of dill and
a slice of lime. Bake or steam the fish until just cooked.
Unwrap it when cool but not cold. Skin and bone it. Weigh the flesh, then
shred it with a pair of forks, working in gradually the juices contained in
the wrappings and plenty of cool, melted butter (using a ratio of three
parts butter to four parts fish).
Season with salt, pepper, very finely-grated zest of lime and chopped fresh
dill. Pack into pots and seal with a thin film of clarified butter.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A place to mature - How to keep fine wine safe
for years to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not long ago the fine wine debate centred on who, in an inflationary era,
would pay the costs of maturing the wine. Answer: the consumer. Now it
centres on how, in a period of recession and of commercial uncertainty, the
majority of fine wine consumers who store their wine can be sure they will
eventually be reunited with it.
Anyone who wants to be certain of the pleasure of drinking great wine at its
best, perhaps 20 years after it was made, has to buy it young and find
somewhere suitably cool, dark, still and secure in which to keep it.
This usually means buying and storing it through a retail wine merchant. But
what do you do when the merchant goes bust - as happened to Nigel Baring and
Hungerford Wine, Berkshire? Unless each case of wine is clearly identified,
by name or code with its individual owner, it is generally impossible to
establish legal ownership.
The fine wine market is already weakened by the failure of most 1980
vintages to gain sufficiently in value to justify early investment, and by
the paucity of exciting vintages since 1990. If merchants cannot guarantee
the safety of the stocks they hold for individual consumers, they may see
the market disappear.
For an increasing proportion of wine enthusiasts, the complication and
uncertainty involved in investing in something as unpredictable as wine is
just too much. As the quality and early drinkability of basic-to-medium
calibre wine has increased markedly, so the incentives to invest in wine
that, conventionally, has been considered 'fine' - ie ageworthy - diminish.
Yet great wine at its best is incomparable in its potential effect on
consumers and is what inspires most producers to keep on raising standards.
Efforts made, by top producers in Bordeaux and the Rhone particularly, to
make even long-term wines taste good on the way to maturity, are admirable.
But wine demands time and steady low-temperature storage; two increasingly
precious commodities.
The world's greatest quantity of fine wine held in store for individual
consumers is in Britain. It is therefore vital that British merchants and
wine storage specialists put their warehouses in order so that confidence in
fine wine storage can be re-established.
Many merchants offer to store wine for their customers for a few pounds a
year per case. Few have their own warehousing, although exceptions include:
Averys of Bristol, which charges Pounds 5.25 per case per year to store wine
in its Georgian warehouse; Justerini &amp; Brooks, part of Grand Met; Berry Bros
&amp; Rudd, sister to Cutty Sark whisky; and the Wine Society of Stevenage, a
non-profit co-operative and probably the safest bet.
Most other merchants use one of the storage specialists, such as Trapps
Cellars and Octavian. They can offer suitably dark, dank caverns full of
wine, respectively beneath London Bridge station and in an old munitions
dump in Corsham, Wiltshire.
Octavian charges individual consumers, who represent about five per cent of
its business, Pounds 7.50 a case per year for lots of up to 30 cases; the
rate falling to Pounds 5.25 for more than 100 cases. Octavian charges its
wine merchant customers Pounds 4.75 a case per year - to which the merchants
add supplements for administration before calculating storage charges to
customers.
Octavian has launched a scheme designed to calm individuals' fears about the
security of their bottles. Each case within a merchant's stock is labelled
with the name of its individual owner. Each individual customer of that
merchant has his or her own stack of wine within the merchant's own area.
Corsham has 1m sq ft to play with. This scheme, called Protection Plus, is
free until the end of March, and will then be offered at 80p a case handling
charge.
Trapps, more geared to trade than private customers, maintains that its
system of allotting each case an individual code effectively replicates
this, but its efficacy depends on the quality of each merchant's
bookkeeping, and it is presumably the least financially secure merchants who
are most likely to skimp on this.
Bibendum, of London NW1, has already invested considerable time, and Pounds
15,000 in software, in devising its own system. Each case is labelled and
each of its customers is sent an individual stock list at regular intervals
which it claims is physically checked with cases at Corsham.
When asked whether he considered his system superior to others in the wine
trade, Bibendum's managing director Tom Heywood-Lonsdale said: 'We shouldn't
be competitive in this area. All wine merchants should have exactly the
same, high standards.'
The Bunch, a group of seven high-profile independent wine merchants (Adnams,
John Armit, Corney &amp; Barrow, Lay &amp; Wheeler, Laytons, Tanner and Yapp) has
drawn up a code of practice for wine storage which, for duty-paid stocks at
least, is very similar to the Octavian scheme, but without the luxury of
stacks for individual customers.
Security of stocks held in bond is more complicated, and Graham Chidgey, of
Laytons, admits that it will be some time before an agreement can be reached
on stocks of wine held abroad, as many young Bordeaux wines are, for
example.
There should be one system which operates throughout the fine wine trade
which, surely, an effective trade organisation would have devised long ago.
It will be messy and inconvenient to put it in place, but it is in
everyone's interest to do so, even at this late stage. Now, while there is
so little activity in the en primeur market for wine futures, there is
simply no excuse not to.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Wine at Waddesdon - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON and and GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is to have a new centre for wine appreciation, in the cellars of an
extraordinary monument to connoisseurship, Waddesdon Manor, near Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire.
This grand Victorian country house, constructed by Baron Ferdinand de
Rothschild in the style of a 16th century Loire chateau, will be open to the
public from the beginning of April, after four years of meticulous
renovation by Jacob, the fourth Lord Rothschild.
Well aware of the fascination of Victorian kitchens for the British public
(vide Brighton Pavilion, Castle Drogo and countless television programmes),
Lord Rothschild and his team have transformed Waddesdon's substantial
below-stairs area into an example of a 'gentleman's working cellar' - a neat
example of lateral, or rather vertical, thinking.
As an acknowledgement of the importance of wine to various branches of the
family, the cellars will hold thousands of bottles of the Rothschild first
growths, Chateaux Lafite and Mouton, many of them from the last century.
There will be a shop selling young vintages of these wines and their less
aristocratic relations (now produced as far afield as Chile and California),
and there are plans to host wine-related exhibitions and special wine
tastings, both in the cellars and in the Dairy, a construction in
Waddesdon's grounds which has more in common with Marie-Antoinette and
Versailles than with anything as prosaic as a cow.
More details from Ben Howkins on 071-493 8111.

Pierre Androuet's Guide to Cheeses (revised edition, Aidan Ellis, Pounds
9.99, 551 pages) has always been an essential for those seriously interested
in cheese. It also has drawbacks: the translation is stiff; Androuet is on
uncertain ground when it comes to foreign cheeses and the style is often
comically magisterial and Gallic. Androuet is nonetheless wonderfully sound
on the important issues: pasteurisation and the role of pasture in taste
and, of course, the seasons; the pleasures of which are being progressively
nullified by pasteurisation.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sport: Lack of depth in the women's game - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today Steffi Graf, the 24-year-old German, and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain, two years younger, meet in the final of the Ford Australian Open, the
first grand slam championship of 1994. For both it will be an important
occasion, the first real test for either at a meeting where the average
women's standard has been disappointingly thin.
Graf has lost just 26 games in the six matches that have brought her to a
fifth final here in Melbourne, three of which have ended in victory.
Sanchez, who has lost at the semi-final stage for the last three years, has
conceded one set and 38 games in reaching the final for the first time.
These two, the current leaders of the women's game in the absence of the
reigning champion Monica Seles, have played each other 26 times since 1988.
Steffi has won 21 of those matches, including a semi-final victory here last
year. But three of Arantxa's five wins have been at the grand slams, two in
Paris and one in New York.
The first of those French wins came unexpectedly in 1989 when Arantxa, a
bubbling 17-year-old who chased every ball with exuberance, revealed an
uncertainty in Graf's game that has been apparent since on the great
occasions.
The second French win, an amazing 6-0 6-2 semi-final victory, occurred two
years later. It was the first 6-0 set that Graf had lost in five years and
came at a time when Steffi was going through family problems concerning her
father, Peter, on whom she had always depended.
These days Graf is altogether more independent. She looks fitter and faster
than she did last year and is hitting the ball harder than ever thanks to a
new compression moulded graphite racket.
Yet there is still a doubt about Graf's ability to maintain her attacking
game against a scrambler of the class of Sanchez. Two of their matches stand
out. The first, at the US Open in 1992, on a surface similar to that in use
in Melbourne, was full of German frailty. The number of unforced errors Graf
committed that day brought her a 7-6 6-3 defeat.
It was the same last year on Florida clay at the Lipton Championships where
Sanchez simply allowed Graf to hit herself to a 6-4 3-6 6-3 defeat. Steffi's
coach Heinz Gunthardt could hardly believe what he had seen. 'She seemed
determined to lose,' he said after.
While recognising Graf's wonderful record in the grand slams - this is her
22nd final of which she has won 14 - the pressure on the athletic German is
growing as Seles' return to competition draws nearer. (The best guess is
that Monica will play in Palm Springs next month.) Riding a streak of three
consecutive grand slam wins, Steffi knows that her free ride atop the
computer is about to end. This knowledge might work to the advantage of
Sanchez. If the Spaniard can return Graf's serve with interest, as she did
during those wins in Florida and New York, then she could win. If, however,
the Spaniard stops believing in herself for an instant and stops playing
positively, she will be swept away on a tide of German aggression.
The lack of real depth in women's tennis is worrying. It is hard to believe
that there was only one American in the quarter-finals.
Lindsay Davenport, 16th seed, is a tall, promising 17-year-old with the
build of a basketball player and powerful groundstrokes. She was too
inexperienced to worry Graf in the quarter-finals but the confident nature
of her 6-2 6-7 6-2 win against fellow American Mary Joe Fernandez, seeded No
3 and twice a finalist here, was encouraging.
With Jennifer Capriati away from the circuit for an indefinite period while
she returns to school in search of a normal teenage existence, the game
needs more talented Americans challenging for the top honours.
Elsewhere the challenge was virtually non-existent. Kimiko Date, the winner
against Fernandez in Sydney two weeks ago and the first Japanese
semi-finalist here since 1973, was completely overawed against Graf in the
semi-finals.
Gabriela Sabatini, without a tournament win since the Italian Open in 1992,
was equally ineffective against Sanchez in the other semi-final. In spite of
her convincing win against Wimbledon finalist Jana Novotna in the previous
round, Sabatini looked slow and unhappy with her game.
Carlos Kirmayr, Sabatini's Brazilian coach, with whom she has resumed the
successful partnership that brought her the 1990 US Open title, has much
work to do - particularly on her serve which has become something of a
liability.
Tomorrow's men's final will pit top seeded Pete Sampras, the Wimbledon and
US Open champion against the No 9 seed, Todd Martin, whose quarter-final
appearance at last year's Wimbledon was his previous best grand slam
performance. It will be the first final between two native born Americans.
(South African-born Johan Kriek had just become an American citizen when he
beat Steve Denton in 1982.)
In the semi-finals, Martin revealed the inadequacy of Stefan Edberg's serve
by blasting countless winning returns. He also served 13 aces to Edberg's
six. Martin's 3-6 7-6 7-6 7-6 win was an awesome display of power hitting.
In beating his old friend and doubles partner Jim Courier 6-3 6-4 6-4,
Sampras was even more impressive. Courier, bidding to become the first man
to win three times in a row since Roy Emerson put together five successive
wins between 1963 and 1967, was simply outplayed.
Sampras hit almost twice as many winners as Courier (42-22) and committed
fewer unforced errors (17-21) in a performance of relentless aggression.
Poor Courier. Hard as this dogged competitor tried, he was simply outgunned.
Martin seems certain to share the same fate.

Arnie reports: 'People who have seen us on a TV show hosted by Steve
Podborsky, one of the celebrated crazy Canucks who won nine downhills, or on
BCTV, keep coming up to talk to us. One said: 'Are you the guys who are
skiing for ever and ever?'
'We are collecting a lift ticket from each resort in an album - and Clint

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sport: A hug can give you a lift - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silver Star, hidden away in a remote part of Canada's Okanagan Valley, is
about to ignite a small but bright glow in the minds of those British skiers
already committed to crossing the Atlantic for their annual romp in the
snow.
The main cause of its sudden emergence as a potential world player is the
opening up of some impressive intermediate and advanced terrain, thus making
it the biggest ski area in British Columbia after Whistler / Blackcomb, and
removing almost at a stroke its reputation as a mere family hill for
beginners and intermediates.
A diminutive ski-lift attendant, Mary-Jane Rutherford, also deserves part of
the credit. It takes all sorts to be a 'Liftie': in the Alps you are lucky
if they acknowledge your existence; in the States they ask 'How's it goin'?'
and wish you a nice day, but at Silver Star they go one better - they hug
you. Not every time you use their lift, of course, but pretty much as often
as you feel the urge . . .
More phlegmatic types, determined to preserve stiff upper lips, will not
want to be hugged or have their space invaded by a complete stranger. Even
some of the Canadians themselves are not overly fond of the idea. But to me
it felt just about as spontaneous as a good gimmick can be.
During our visit to this delightful ski area, I was hugged by a number of
female 'Lifties', including Mary-Jane, the young lady who started the trend;
it can be quite a tonic on a winter's day.
It all started when Miss Rutherford, the slightest but most exuberant of
lift operators, noticed that a skier had written 'Have you hugged your kids
today?' on a message board at the bottom of her lift.
She changed it to 'Have you hugged your Liftie?' - and was immediately
swamped with so many hugs that it became a habit. Now most of Mary-Jane's
colleagues are up for hugs too. The habit has even spread to neighbouring
ski resorts.
A ski resort, of course, cannot live by hugs alone, and Silver Star has many
other qualities. With skiing on both sides of Aberdeen mountain there are
more than 60 attractive trails cut through the trees and encompassing every
degree of difficulty.
Vance Creek, the traditional side of the mountain which opened in 1958, has
38 trails almost exclusively aimed at family and intermediate skiers.
On the other side of the mountain, Putnam Creek was opened a year or so ago
and has some scorchingly steep trails among its 23 runs. Another large
mountain face across the valley is earmarked for further expansion.
Many of the trail names reflect either the area's mining history or
astronomical connotations in keeping with the resort's name. Lone Star,
Milky Way, Constellation and Big Dipper are all enjoyable blue runs on the
Vance Creek side. White Elephant, Gypsy Queen and Eldorado, all on the
Putnam Creek side, are named after old mining claims.
Silver Star is run by John Gow, the resort's president. He is a hands-on
executive who lives on the mountain and provides the personal touch that so
many ski resorts lack. The strict planning regulations are simple: 'They
have to please me,' says Gow's wife Heather - and she is only half joking.
She has decreed that the few new buildings erected have to be neo-Victorian
in an attempt to recreate something close to the gaslight era of the late
1890s. With their bright pastel shades and ubiquitous fairy lights, these
town houses make for a colourful, cosy and charming, if ersatz, atmosphere.
Silver Star has become too good and too big to remain a British Columbian
secret for much longer, and already skiers from Europe are beginning to find
their way there.
It can easily be combined with two major skiing attractions already
well-known to British skiers: helicopter skiing in the Bugaboo, Monashee and
Cariboo ranges, and the major destination resort of Whistler/Blackcomb.
This year, for the first time, Silver Star is featured in British ski tour
operators' brochures: Made to measure, Canada's Best and All Canada Travel
and Holidays.
But will it be a question of 'No hugs please - we're British'?
Arnie Wilson stayed at the Vance Creek Hotel, the resort's leading hotel,
with roof-top hot tubs, a Victorian-style dining room and live music which
includes old time fiddle shows. The rates are CDollars 80-124. (tel 0101 604

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sport: A dog of my own - Greyhound Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I think I shall buy a racing greyhound
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a whole racing greyhound - because I now know I will never be rich enough to
own a whole racehorse.
Greyhounds are a lot less expensive than racehorses. I leased a greyhound
once. I had asked the managers at London's White City stadium how to go
about buying a dog. They shuffled their feet. Finally, they suggested that a
gentle introduction to dog-racing would be obtained by leasing a greyhound.
The dog that ran in my name won quite a few races - once at 8-1, which is a
far richer experience than a poke in the eye. But no money changed hands. I
had neither outgoings nor incomings - no training bills, no prize money. All
supremely pointless.
But the notion of owning a greyhound has never gone away, and has been
revived by a splendid book, published this week: The Dogs, by Laura
Thompson, a one-time actress but better known as a sports columnist for The
Times and now as a contributing editor for Esquire.
Thompson writes well, though sometimes too fastidiously, for there are
echoes in her book of Joyce Carol Oates, the American novelist who has
written, with visceral distinction and intellectual tone, about pugilism.
There are passages in The Dogs where Thompson, one feels, struggles in vain
to chase after Ms Oates.
She is a quality act though. Her father owned strings of greyhounds, which
is how she knows her stuff. Crisply, she opens with a chapter called Facts,
which starts: 'The simple facts are these. Six greyhounds run around an
ovoid track in pursuit of a mechanical hare. The hare always wins. It is the
mystery of what will come second that fascinates those who go to the dogs.'
In Britain, every afternoon and evening, six days a week, people go to the
dogs. At present there are 37 licensed tracks, plus about 50 'flapping' or
unlicensed tracks. About Pounds 400m a year is gambled on the dogs at UK
tracks, and about Pounds 1.6bn off-track. It is Britain's second biggest
spectator sport.
Thompson says that most of the 50,000 dog races in Britain each year are
'roughage' - graded races run for a winner's prize of less than Pounds 100.
The fastest dogs compete in open races, and the fastest of all may make the
final of the greyhound Derby at Wimbledon Stadium, where the prize money is
Pounds 40,000.
'To buy a decent greyhound over the age of 18 months, whose puppy form
implies that it might turn into even a minor open racer, will cost perhaps
Pounds 8,000. A dog that might make a major open racer will almost always
cost five figures.'
How do you buy a greyhound? Possibly from a breeder - ideally, in Ireland -
or from an agent, a trainer, an auction or the back pages of The Greyhound
Life. It might be a puppy or a fully-known quantity. 'Nothing ensures
success,' says Thompson, 'although knowing a good breeder is probably the
safest method. However, these people are not so easy to get in with . . .
One has to be in the know. It is only those that are in the know that have
any real chance of consistent success.'
At Pounds 25-Pounds 35 a week, a greyhound is very cheap to keep. If it
stays fit and wins occasionally, it should pay for itself. To make money out
of a graded greyhound, however, says Thompson, you need to be an astute
gambler.
On the other hand, a good open racer will 'earn wads of prize money,
shelf-fuls of silverware, delicious hoards of gambling returns and perhaps,
if male, thousands of pounds' worth of stud fees.' The stud fee for a
greyhound that has already sired good pups is Pounds 400 or more - a
fraction of the stallion fee for a tip-top racehorse, but still a useful
earner.
Although it is the great working class sport, dog racing has declined, says
Thompson, to a worrying point. 'From occupying a proud, even necessary place
in sporting culture, 'the dogs' now keeps a dimly picturesque corner in
popular social history: a thing that people have never not known about but
have never really known about, a thing that, as with many old things, is
loved not with a passion but with indulgence.'
Except, of course, that there are still what you might call dog people -
people doing the thing they want to be doing, casually and unthinkingly in
love with their sport.
Thompson is excellent on dog people, some of whom are 'lary'. Lary, she
says, is a conflation of the words leery, wary and garish. 'It is a
millionaire market trader, a bright gold Rolls-Royce, a country mansion in
Wanstead, the good-humoured smile and suspicious eyes of a successful
bookmaker.'
An acquaintance of her father, who had made a lot of money, started flashing
it around: red polo-necks, declamatory suits, dainty house ornaments, a
condom-shaped car. ''He used to be a silly old sod', said my father. 'Now
he's a silly lary old sod'.'
She is just as good on dogs. She writes movingly about many of them,
including one of her father's, called Commutering, a big, brindle dog, very
male-looking, with ears that pricked up into tall triangles. Commutering won
many open races. Then he went to stud. But cancer got hold of him. He could
have been saved if the vet had been allowed to amputate a leg, but
Thompson's father wasn't going to let that happen.
''I wasn't going to do that to the old feller',' her father told her, and
Thompson 'understood that he had done the right thing by his racing
greyhound in allowing him to die calm and intact.'
References to dog racing crop up in the most unexpected contexts. In a US
magazine article recently, discussing Bill Gates of Microsoft and whether
Gates' enormous power in the computer world was dangerously untrammelled, a
leading manufacturer of work-stations said:
'I like Bill ..But I think the problem is that Microsoft has caught the
bunny. You know, when you go to the dog track they have that mechanical
bunny that makes the dogs run? Well, sometimes a dog is so fast he catches
the bunny and then the other dogs don't run any more. That's the situation
in the software business today: Bill has caught the bunny. I admire Bill for
catching the bunny, but now we can't have a race.'
I will never catch the bunny; but I think I can afford a greyhound.
The Dogs, by Laura Thompson, Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 9.99.

A brewer and an intensive care nurse in a hospital's liver unit make an
incongruous mix. Nevertheless, Andrew Bishop, 28, founder of London's newest
brewery, is grateful for the vocation followed by his wife, Alison, a sister
at King's College Hospital.
'She paid the bills while I set the business up,' he said.
Bishop's Brewery is a fledgling concern in the shadow of Southwark Cathedral
and the Borough fruit and vegetable market just across the River Thames from
the City. A former grain warehouse has been transformed, thanks to a loan
from Midland Bank and the largely unpaid efforts of thirsty friends, from a
spider-ridden shell into a plant capable of producing 850 gallons of beer a
week.
Start-up costs, including some second-hand equipment, worked out at about
Pounds 20,000, plus another Pounds 10,000 for brewery transport, essential
for deliveries to outlying pubs willing to take a new beer. Said Bishop:
'I'll deliver to almost anyone who wants some.'
Bishop had managed the adjacent Market Porter pub, a free house, for five
years before staleness set in: 'I wasn't going to progress in the business
and didn't fancy any of the other houses in the group. It was time to go it
alone.'
It was not all plain sailing, however.
Locating the premises was easy: he agreed a six-year lease from the trustees
of Borough Market in January 1993. Local residents raised no objections.
Bishop gave himself three months before brewing began; steelwork was
erected, plumbing and electrics installed. He reckoned, however, without the
attentions of Southwark Council.
The local environmental health officer expressed anxiety over the
ventilation, and council permission to change the use of the building proved
more of a problem than expected. But Bishop eventually occupied the building
in November, producing his first brew on December 18.
Cathedral, as the initial beer was predictably named, proved a great success
in a limited market. Test tasting by electricians, plumbers and, I have to
admit, journalists, indentified a light hoppy beer with a definite bite.
'That was my fault, I put twice as many hops in as I meant to,' Bishop
admitted.
The recipe has since settled down, although it still features more hops than
the average brew: 'It's not a run-of-the-mill product, it's still got a
pronounced hop character that sets it apart from grim mass-produced muck.'
Bishop, working on his own at present, supplies five pubs in the area as
well as a few further afield. Potential expansion from these modest levels
is limited by design: 'I don't want to get too big too soon; I've seen too
many people come unstuck.'
Indeed, the path from the Tom Caxton home brew kit to the handpump in the
hostelry is littered with well-intentioned failures. Many a homebrewer
thinks a marketable beer is just around the corner. Few succeed.
Bishop's past is free from such experiments: 'I don't like drinking beer at
home, it somehow doesn't fit with armchairs and sofas.'
His experience is mostly in the trade: 'I fell into the licensed trade
straight from school, working, illegally (he was under-age), behind a bar in
Streatham.' Bishop honed his brewing knowledge with a three-month stint with
David Bruce's famed Firkin chain. 'I never met him but I learnt a lot about
costings.'
In spite of the sizeable capacity, Bishop only needs to sell eight 36-gallon
barrels a week to break even. He hopes to turn over Pounds 60,000 this year.
Advertising is another step to be faced. 'I haven't been out in a suit and
tie pushing people . . . yet.'
Beer festivals and a growing number of pubs willing to take beer from small
breweries do his cause no harm. 'Beer-spotters come from miles to taste a
new beer, and if they like it, they spread it.'
Which is not necessarily good news for Kings' liver unit . . .

FT  29 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Number one is the first among
numbers - But why is 59 so weak?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the most frequently used number between one and 100? No prizes for
guessing the answer. It is, of course, one. But what is the least used
number? The answer is 97.
I can say this with some certainty because I did a little research during my
Christmas holiday idleness. Thanks to the miracle of electronic data search
technology, I was able to find out how many times each number between one
and 100 appeared in 17 UK newspapers during 1993.
In case anyone thinks I'm dotty, the research took only a few minutes, and I
hold no mystical belief in numbers. I was simply curious to see whether
there were any interesting patterns or anomalies. As far as I knew, no one
had ever looked into this before. Indeed, no one would have been able to
until computerised databases became available quite recently.
But like many pioneers, I encountered an early disappointment. The results
were rather predictable: smaller numbers get used a lot more than bigger
ones.
The interesting thing, though, is that the pattern is quite smooth, as a
glance at the chart shows. But the downward slope is a curve rather than a
gradient. It descends sharply from its initial peak, starts leveling out in
the 30s, and then tails off gradually towards 100. Even the 10s show a
consistent pattern, except for 50 and 100.
More interesting is that the curve has a marked logarithmic shape to it, in
other words, the variation between the use of individual numbers diminishes
progressively rather than at a steady rate. This is presumably evidence for
the hypothesis that the higher the numbers, the less people care about the
difference between them.
If so, this slope could be quite useful in helping people deal with issues
which depend on perceptions of the size of numbers. For example, you could
use it to calculate the size of bonuses needed to provide required levels of
incentive, or people's reaction to news of disasters involving large losses
of life, or the political impact of decisions which affect large numbers of
jobs.
What other points emerged?
The blips on the curve show clearly that we operate a decimal system, again
predictable. But they also give an idea of the lingering strength of the
duodecimal system. Blips are visible at 12, 24 etc up to 72. Only at 84 do
they vanish, suggesting that six dozen is about the limit.
Thirty-one sticks up a bit. This was the favourite number of Srinivasa
Ramanujan, the Indian mathematical genius, because it begins a remarkable
series of prime numbers (331,3331 etc). I got a bit excited about this but I
suspect the reason here is more prosaic: 31 is the last day of many
accounting months.
There is also a hump at 92,93,94, which I took to reflect the year the
numbers appeared.
Number 13 is under-used, but apart from that I could find nothing to comfort
or frighten the superstitious.
If the underlying pattern is correct - that a number is less used the
greater it is - this means that the natural place for each number is itself.
In other words, 57 should rank 57th in use. But there are many exceptions.
An interesting exercise is to find the numbers which are used more
frequently, or less frequently, than they should be. I decided to call these
'strong' and 'weak'.
The strongest number is 100, which ranks 16th in use and is therefore 84
places ahead of itself. Other strong numbers are the 10s and 5s, and those
such as 93 and 72 which can be explained.
The weakest number is 59 (which slips 22 places to 81st), followed by
61,58,41 and 39. I suspect they are the casualties of 'bunching' - the
tendency to round up or down to strong numbers such as 60 and 40.
Even numbers do better than odd numbers in the strength rankings, which is
probably because they are more useful, being more easily divisible. For
similar reasons, I suspect, prime numbers are also weak: only one (67) makes
it to the strong category.
I'm not sure how the concept of strong and weak numbers can be exploited. Do
strong numbers influence the way people feel about them? Do you have more
respect for 45 (which is five places up) than for 28 (five places down)?
Might people who market brands which contain numbers find something here?
Well, anyway, it helped pass the holiday. If anyone wants the raw data to
experiment for themselves, just send me a stamped addressed envelope at the
FT.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: An ugly way of life - Clive
Fewins meets a man who makes gargoyles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hands that carved 1,000 gargoyles are still hard at work. Now 74,
veteran sculptor and stonemason Michael Groser still chips away, paper hat
on head, whenever he receives a call from an Oxford college that a vital
part of its structure is in need of replacement.
The call usually comes from an architect or a contractor. But whatever the
intermediary, Groser's work is stamped indelibly on the Oxford skyline, and
on the interiors of parish churches and other buildings.
Many of the hundreds of pinnacles at All Souls college, each adorned with a
profusion of crockets, or little stone bulges, are Groser replacements of
medieval originals.
At the same college most of the replacement carving on the famous twin
Hawksmoor towers are Groser's, while at New College there are some 200
carvings by him. Groser sang in the college chapel, as a salaried lay clerk,
for 27 years. Singing was his first career after he left university and
theological college, where he spent 18 months before he decided against
following his father into the priesthood.
In spite of acquiring an Equity card and acting in two films, Groser settled
for architectural sculpture, being drawn to Oxford from London in 1955 by
the lure of work and the fact that his wife Eileen was born there.
It was the time of the great drive to restore many of the colleges, and by
the early 1960s Groser found himself in demand by local builders. He soon
found he had the ability to mimic the medieval styles. The little stone
demons, wrestlers, bishops, horsemen and dogs, as well as figures with all
manner of afflictions from gumboils to large warts stare down at the
observant visitor.
Gargoyles, properly named grotesques, were a sort of medieval joke,
introduced by stonemasons. They are also believed to represent the last
vestiges of paganism - guarding the Christian buildings against the pagan
forces the faith had subdued.
Whatever their origins, gargoyles and grotesques were often caricatures of
well-known faces in the medieval town.
Michael Groser's work carries the same humorous stamp. At the Oxford church
of St Peter in the East - now the library of St Edmund Hall - he was
commissioned to carve 12 faces; the principal, bursar, librarian and a past
principal among them. Others include the foreman, chief architect, and
managing director of the main contractor at the time, and Groser himself.
That is not the only college building in which Groser's stone caricature
appears. In one other he is wearing the familiar daily newspaper hat that he
always makes for himself to keep the dust out of his hair.
As well as being a caricaturist in stone, Michael Groser is also a wood
carver of note. Examples of his work can be seen in Westminster Abbey, St
Paul's Cathedral, Wells Cathedral, St Stephen Wallbrook church in London
and, more recently, as part of the National Trust's major restoration of
Waddesdon Manor near Aylesbury.
'Generally I prefer working in stone. You are not constantly sharpening
tools, as with wood, and you have to be thinking about the work all the
time,' he said.
'It's nice to think that many of the stone grotesques I have replaced date
from around 1390 and it's even nicer to think that many of my replacements
should also last about 600 years,' he said.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A credit to all concerned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am not an accountant, just an interested amateur. I refer to your Q&amp;A
answer 'Income tax query' on January 15. Should it not be Pounds 10,000 at
20 per cent (and not Pounds 8,000 at 25 per cent)? If I am right, I am
astonished.
The credit at 25 per cent on Pounds 8,000 was based upon the assumption that
by his phrase 'investment (equities gross) of Pounds 10,000,' the reader
meant 'Schedule F income of Pounds 10,000' - viz, UK dividends of Pounds
8,000 plus their 25 per cent tax credits.
The reply was sent to him by post before Christmas and, as he had not come
back to us, we assume that was indeed what he meant.
Because UK dividends have been paid gross for the past 20 years (except for
dividends on building society shares, which have had tax deducted from them
since April 1991), it is often difficult for us to be sure what a reader
means when he or she talks about his or her 'gross' income from UK equities.
So, we do the best we can.
Correction
In the same reply, the figure Pounds 6,225.75 should have read Pounds
6,215.75; similarly, Pounds 4,225.75 should have been Pounds 4,215.75. But
these misprints did not affect the final tax bill of Pounds 571.00 - viz, 20
per cent of Pounds 2,855.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Sharing a nanny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I share a nanny with another family and her duties, for both families,
include the delivery of children to school and collecting them.
Since she incurs motor and other expenses during her duties, it would be
advantageous for her to work on a self-employed basis and thus claim
expenses against her income. Is this is acceptable to the Revenue?
Both the Revenue and the Contributions Agency of the DSS are likely to
resist the nanny's claim to be self-employed. She will, therefore, need
professional assistance from someone skilled in this area of law.
As a first step, she could ask her tax office for the free pamphlets IR28
(Starting in business) and IR56 (Employed or self-employed? - a guide for
tax and national insurance).

FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unwelcome Miras bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My husband and I bought our house in January 1988 when we were not married.
The mortgage was Pounds 37,000. We married in May that year but did not tell
the building society until a few months ago. The Revenue is now claiming we
have been receiving too much Miras and has sent us an accumulative bill of
nearly Pounds 900.
The provisions of section 42 of the Finance Act 1988 were designed to
discourage cohabiting mortgagors from marrying: although the 1988 act was
not passed until after you had got married, the March Budget, plus comment
in the FT and elsewhere, did make the then chancellor's proposed tax penalty
for marriage quite clear. It is a pity both of you missed all the warnings
against getting married while your joint mortgage exceeded Pounds 30,000.
You say you did not tell the building society of your marriage until a few
months ago but it is not clear if you also kept your respective tax offices
in the dark. If you did, then your respective tax affairs will need revision
for 1988-89 onwards as a whole (not just in respect of the mortgage
interest) because you will have continued to be taxed as two single people
instead of as a married couple.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Revenue refuses to budge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In my share dealing during the present tax year, I made profits of Pounds
3,500 and losses of Pounds 3,000. Am I entitled to carry forward the losses
against any capital gains tax in the future?
We consider the answer is yes. Unfortunately, the Inland Revenue maintains
the answer is no. It is to be hoped the question will be decided in the
House of Lords one day.
The crucial wording is now to be found in section 2(2)(b) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992: 'Capital gains tax shall be charged on the total
amount of chargeable gains accruing to the person chargeable in the year of
assessment, after deducting . . . so far as they have not been allowed as a
deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous year of assessment,
any allowable losses accruing to that person in any previous year of
assessment (not earlier than the year 1965-66).'
We consider the Revenue's construction of the words after the dots to be
perverse and untenable. It considers our construction to be contrary to the
intention of parliament.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Where privilege still counts - A
tax-saving loan intended to benefit budding entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While mortgage interest relief dies a long and lingering death, there is
another type of loan which retains its privileged tax status.
In line with the government's aim of encouraging budding entrepreneurs,
loans taken out to acquire shares in privately-owned companies qualify for
full tax relief, with no upper limit. But failure to comply with a plethora
of conditions will forfeit this attractive tax-saving opportunity.
The most straightforward requirement is that the shares bought with the
borrowed funds must be 'ordinary' shares; this rules out preference shares
which receive the same fixed-rate dividend, irrespective of how the company
performs.
All the other conditions relate either to the company in which the shares
are being acquired, or the link between that company and the shareholder.
The company must be a 'close' company - broadly, one under the control of
five or fewer individuals, or of its directors. This often is a potential
problem for executives who take part in a management buy-out. Such MBO
companies will usually be controlled by institutional investors and, as
such, will not be close.
Fortunately, the Inland Revenue accepts that if the company is close when
the borrower buys his shares, the fact that it becomes 'open' will not
jeopardise the interest relief. To exploit this concession, managers engaged
in a buy-out should first form their own company. This will satisfy the
'close company' condition before the outside investors take control.
Being the first subscribers, however, could make it more difficult for
managers to clear the second hurdle, which is that the company must be a
'trading company' when they invest in it. How widely this term should be
construed was the point at issue in a High Court case last year. It followed
the management buy-out of a business called Microsystems from Plessey, the
electrical giant.
The management team set up a company called Radstone, intending to use this
as its buy-out vehicle. The team took up shares in Radstone - financed by
bank borrowings - several months before the purchase of Microsystems was
concluded.
The Revenue rejected the managers' claim for tax relief on their bank
interest and claimed Radstone was not yet a trading company when they
subscribed for their shares. Its hair-splitting logic was that the main
purpose of a trading company must be carrying on a trade whereas, at the
relevant time, Radstone's main purpose was to acquire Microsystems from
Plessey.
This sophistry was rejected by the judge. He ruled that if a company was
established to acquire a trade, it could fairly be said that, even before
the trade was acquired, the company's purpose was to carry on that trade.
The acquisition of the trade was the means by which that purpose was
achieved and not an end in itself. So, the managers won.
Assuming the company qualifies as both close and trading, the focus will
then shift to the borrower's relationship with it. There are two tests. One
is that the borrower - either alone or together with his close relatives and
other associates - owns more than 5 per cent of the ordinary shares.
Where this threshold is not reached, the Taxes Act 1988 says relief will be
available only if, during the period starting when the loan is drawn down
and ending when the interest is paid, 'the individual has worked for the
greater part of his time in the actual management or conduct of the
company.'
There has always been uncertainty as to how far up the managerial hierarchy
you had to be in order to satisfy the 'management or conduct' test. The
Revenue's opinion - set out last November in its Tax Bulletin - is that the
individual must have a role 'in the overall running and policy-making of the
company as a whole.'
In the Revenue's view, it follows from this that 'managerial or technical
responsibility for just one particular area' will not suffice. So, it seems
that project-based rocket scientists will lose out to head office plodders.
Borrowers who can pass these manifold tests will get tax relief, not only if
they use the loan to buy shares but also if they lend that money on to a
close trading company - provided the money is used exclusively for the
purposes of that company's business.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Caution reigns - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the market climbed to new heights, directors remained on the sidelines,
particularly at the beginning of the week. Activity was marked by a number
of deals in companies with large market capitalisations.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, sold 80,000 ordinary
shares. There have been several option-related transactions recently but
this was the first deal in ordinaries. The sales accounted for a quarter of
Sir Allen's holding.
Osprey Communications was noted earlier this year when Ronald Sidaway bought
125,000 shares at 41p. He has continued to buy at prices as high as 49p; the
shares are trading now at about 53p.
ASTEC (BSR), now based in Hong Kong, is involved in designing and making
power conversion products and other electronic equipment. Technical director
Neal Stewart sold his entire holding at 85.5p, although he retains some
incentive shares.
Correction: Last week, we reported a sale of 35,000 shares by three
directors of Blacks Leisure. In fact, there was a purchase of 40,500, giving
a total value of Pounds 14,985 transacted by four directors.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: So you can't work . . . - The
benefits of permanent health insurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Parliament this week gave a second reading to a bill which could mean
200,000 people stop being eligible for invalidity benefits after April 1995
and new claimants get considerably less than they would now.
The number of people claiming invalidity benefit has soared, so the
government is trying to curb costs. The bill going through parliament
replaces statutory sick pay and invalidity benefit with a single Incapacity
Benefit, which increases depending on the length of time a person is out of
action. The key change is not in timing or levels of benefit, however, but
the definition of incapacity to work.
The usual interpretation of present regulations is that claimants must be
incapable of doing their normal jobs or any 'reasonable' job - one for which
their experience or qualifications are suited. A skilled manual worker
unable to do his own job might be capable physically of light office work.
Under present rules, he would get benefit if he was not qualified to do
this.
In future, this definition will be replaced after 28 weeks with one based on
an objective medical test of physical and mental capacity for any kind of
work at all, so excluding many present claimants.
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux reports that the
stricter criteria are being applied in some areas already. 'Bureaux all over
the country report an alarming increase in benefit withdrawals,
demonstrating that a narrower definition of incapacity is already being
used,' it says. 'Many CAB clients are told that they should seek work
completely unrelated to their skills, disability or previous experience.'
The association says people have been told to find jobs as artists' models,
embalmers or bingo callers.
People found ineligible for invalidity benefit may then claim unemployment
benefit or income support. But the latter is means-tested and no one with
assets over Pounds 8,000 is eligible. So, anyone with savings over this
level has to use them up before qualifying.
Insurance companies and friendly societies have for many years offered a
private sector version of sick pay, usually known as permanent health
insurance. A monthly premium buys cover for up to 75 per cent of your salary
if you cannot work through ill-health. But Martin Werth of Munich Re, a
reinsurance company, says that only 10 to 12 per cent of the UK population
has PHI cover.
Insurers have, like the government, been faced with unsustainable claim
rates and some have responded by tightening definitions as well.
They tend to use two definitions of incapacity. The traditional, more
generous version is the 'own occupation' definition, paying out if you
cannot perform your usual job.
The other is inability to carry on your own occupation or any occupation to
which you are suited by education and experience.
Some insurers switch to this wider definition after two years of a claim.
Others use it from the start, particularly for certain occupations such as
airline pilots where a very minor health problem can mean the permanent end
of a flying career.
No insurer at present requires claimants to be incapable of any work
whatsoever, the direction in which the government is moving. The insurance
ombudsman stamped this out by interpreting 'any job' as meaning 'any
reasonable job,' thereby excluding unsuitable work.
The private sector sees it as inevitable that the changes in the state
system will increase demand for PHI. But Werth says the implications will
take a while to sink in.
'The present level of state benefits is very low and would give a standard
of living equal only to an unskilled worker, living on a council estate,
with no car and no margin for luxuries,' he says. After April 1995, when the
earnings-related element (now worth a maximum of about Pounds 59 a week) is
eliminated, the safety net will provide an even more spartan life style.
'Not much will happen before April 1995, and then the horror stories will
start coming through,' Werth predicts. He thinks 20 or 25 per cent of the
population could have PHI cover by the year 2000.
Unfortunately, PHI is expensive. Premiums depend on your age, sex, health,
occupation, salary, and the length of time you are prepared to wait after
falling ill before payments begin. Premiums to buy cover of about Pounds
2,000 a month for a white-collar worker can cost more than Pounds 50 a
month.
Bob Farrington, chief executive of the Ideal Benefit Society, a friendly
society, says contracts will have to become cheaper and more flexible.
Friendly society sick pay is usually based on the 'Holloway contract,' which
starts paying immediately and also has a savings element to provide a small
pension. Ideal Benefit has adapted this to offer waiting periods of seven
days to two years.
Werth thinks there could be a market for a low-cost PHI product which uses
medical/functional rather than occupational definitions. Although the
definition of incapacity would then be as strict as the state, levels of
benefit could be higher.

Investors wanting to put money into the Far East are almost spoilt for
choice at the moment. In addition to the Edinburgh New Tiger and Martin
Currie Asian Opportunities fund launches mentioned last week, the Fleming
Japanese investment trust is issuing conversion shares and Henry Cooke is
launching an Asian unit trust.
Fleming is hoping to raise at least Pounds 20m with an issue of conversion
shares in its Japanese trust, which has assets of about Pounds 250m. Shares
in the trust are trading at a premium of about 4 per cent to net asset value
 -investors pay 4 per cent more for shares than the assets attributable to
each share are worth - which indicates a high level of demand. The fund is
the best performer of five in its sector over three years to January 1, but
fourth out of six over one year (source: Micropal).
Richard Boyton, an independent financial adviser, says the Fleming C-share
issue could be the cheapest way into Japan at the moment. Rather than buying
ordinary shares at a premium, buyers of the C-shares will pay only the asset
value of the shares plus the administrative costs of the new issue, which
will be 2 per cent or less. Investors will also get one free warrant for
every five shares issued; the warrants were trading at 117p this week.
Money raised from the C-share issue is kept separate from the main fund
until it is at least 90 per cent invested, when the C-shares will be
converted into ordinary shares.
'The Fleming Japanese investment trust is the largest investment trust
specialising in Japan with an impeccable track record. Investors should not
miss the opportunity of being able to buy into this fund at a cost of some 2
per cent,' Boyton says.
Japanese shares have slumped since their peak in 1989 - the Nikkei index is
now at less than half its peak value. A slight recovery last year was wiped
out by recent political uncertainty over the coalition government and its
reform programme, but some fund managers see the Tokyo market's depressed
state as a good buying opportunity for those who take a positive long-term
view of Japan's prospects.
The Fleming public offer opens on Tuesday and closes on February 23. Minimum
investment is Pounds 1,500 for existing investors in the fund and Pounds
2,500 for new investors. Annual fee is 0.5 per cent.
Investors keen on the Far East but preferring to avoid Japan may be
interested in the Henry Cooke Eastern Enterprise fund, the first
non-European unit trust from this Manchester-based group. The fund is to be
managed by Lloyd George Management in Hong Kong, which is responsible
already for a range of offshore south-east Asian trusts.
It will be invested for long-term capital growth throughout south-east Asia
and India, with the largest amounts initially in Hong Kong (including
indirect exposure to China), South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Minimum
investment is Pounds 500, with a 1 per cent discount on the usual initial
charge of 6 per cent between January 31 and February 11. Annual charge is
1.5 per cent.
Save &amp; Prosper is the latest group to come out with a global emerging
markets trust. Its Emerging Markets fund will invest mostly in Asia and
Latin America, with 47 per cent and 39 per cent of the initial portfolio
respectively, but there will also be about 13 per cent in European emerging
markets such as Turkey, the Czech Republic and Greece, and a tiny proportion
in the Middle East. The trust, aiming for long-term capital growth, will be
managed by Fleming Investment Management.
Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 35 a month in a regular
savings scheme. Charges will be 5.5 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent
annually; but between February 5 and 25, there will be discounts on the
initial charge of 1 per cent on investments of Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,999,
and 2 per cent on Pounds 3,000 or more.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Double tax: the pension trap -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's long winter makes the idea of retiring in the sun ever more
appealing. Where to go is one major decision. But the most important task is
to arrange for all your pensions to be paid abroad without double taxation
penalties.
Expert advice on pension and inheritance tax planning is essential, but
there are several important steps you can take in advance to reduce
administrative headaches - as well as your adviser's fees.
Essentially, there are three main sources of pension: state schemes, company
schemes, and private individual plans.
State pensions*
The UK state pension, which builds up through payment of national insurance
contributions, has two elements - a basic, flat-rate benefit and an
earnings-related supplement known as Serps (state earnings-related pension
scheme). The pension is paid at 65 for men and between 60 and 65 for women,
depending on when they retire.
The Department of Social Security (DSS) says state pensions and benefits for
widows can be claimed from anywhere in the world. But annual cost-of-living
increases are paid only if the pensioner lives in a European Union country
or one with which Britain has a social security agreement which provides for
uprating (see table). These do not include Australia, Canada or New Zealand.
For people retiring to these, or to any country not mentioned in the table,
state pensions are frozen either when they leave the UK or, for those
already abroad when they reach state retirement age, at the time of the
first payment.
Clearly, loss of the cost-of-living increases will erode the value of the
pension rapidly over a long retirement and extra income from other sources
will be needed to compensate.
If, however, you return to live in the UK, your state pension will be paid
at the full current rate. Expatriates on a temporary visit home can also
claim the full rate, but only for the period spent in Britain.
Company and private pensions
Company and private individual pensions also can be paid abroad. If you want
to check the value of your pension, contact either the manager of the
company scheme or the life office, in the case of a personal pension or
similar contract.
Most scheme benefit statements will assume, however, that retirement is
within the UK. Robin Arnold, international partner with actuary Bacon &amp;
Woodrow, says: 'It is essential to check how your UK pension benefits will
be treated for tax purposes in your country of retirement. For example,
North America does not recognise the concept of the tax-free cash lump sum
we have in the UK and will tax it along with the pension.'
Many people change jobs several times before reaching retirement, so it will
be necessary to contact previous employers to check the value of deferred
pensions. Where a company has been taken over or collapsed, and it is
difficult to locate trustees, the Pensions Register** will trace your
benefits free of charge.
Foreign pensions
If your career included overseas employment, with foreign state and company
pension entitlements, the tracing problems could be much more complicated.
Alastair McLean, principal with actuary Towers Perrin, says: 'As a general
rule, whether it is state or company pensions, outside the UK the onus is on
the employee to keep track of benefit rights and to make the claims. There
is no central source for information about foreign state pensions - you will
have to contact each authority.'
Bear in mind also that state and private pensions derived from any source
outside your retirement home (including the UK) will be subject to currency
fluctuations which, in turn, will affect your income.
Dealing with the tax man
When you have checked your sources of pension, you should examine how the
money will be taxed. Expert advice is essential and, clearly, the adviser
must know all about the relevant rules in the country of retirement.
Obviously, the aim is to pay tax on pensions and investment income just once
 -usually in your country of retirement. Where the country you choose has a
double taxation agreement with the UK (there are more than 80), the Inland
Revenue will allow pensions to be paid gross. First, though, you will need a
declaration from the foreign tax authorities that they are taxing you on
your world-wide income.
This declaration should be sent immediately to your UK tax office, since any
delays will result in your pensions being taxed twice - once in the UK, at
the basic rate of income tax (now 25 per cent), and again in your country of
retirement.
If, however, there is a delay in sending the form, the Revenue says the
withholding tax can be reclaimed when it gets the declaration from the
foreign authority.
Do not make the mistake of thinking that, if you move to a no-tax
environment such as the Caymans or Bermuda, your pension will be tax-free.
As Arnold warns: 'If the Revenue does not receive the statement from the
local tax authority that you are being taxed on your world-wide income, it
will withhold tax in Britain.'
*To get an idea of what your future state pension will be, ask your local
DSS for the pension forecast form BR19.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: International Bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Investors in international bond funds have enjoyed high returns, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. As the table shows, the average fund returned 57 per
cent over the three years to January 1 (offer-to-bid with net income
re-invested).
This strong performance has resulted from a particularly favourable
combination of factors. The devaluation of sterling after it left the
exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 was the main cause but substantial
falls in inflation and in short-term interest rates also have helped.
Investors cannot necessarily expect the same degree of performance in the
future, though, as the same combination of factors might not recur. But
Jeremy Cunningham, manager of the Invesco International Bond fund, believes
there is more growth to come because European interest rates will fall
'quite considerably' this year. Some 80 per cent of this fund is placed in
European fixed-interest investments.
At the top of the table, the Norwich International Bond trust returned 72.5
per cent over the period to its investors and has an above-average yield of
5.1 per cent. But performance has slipped in the year to January 1 with the
fund's ranking falling to 20 of 27, according to Micropal.
Brian Dowler, a fund manager at NU Investment Management, says 1991 was a
very good year for the fund but believes it could have been underweight in
Japanese bonds at certain periods last year, so missing out on the
significant appreciation of the yen in 1993.
Charges on the Norwich fund are 6 per cent initial and 1.25 per cent annual.
The Invesco fund has an 1.05 per cent initial charge and an annual fee of
0.5 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pep price war gets hotter - Unit
trust companies are competing ever more keenly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Label a product 'tax-free' and it is bound to catch the attention of
investors. Personal equity plans, which allow investors to save up to Pounds
9,000 a year - Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single
company Pep - free of income and capital gains tax, have proved especially
popular for this reason.
The unit trust industry has been riding high on that popularity. Last year,
more than 60 per cent of those who invested in a unit trust did so through a
Pep. So, it is not surprising that unit trust companies are competing keenly
for investors' Pep money, either by reducing charges or by structuring new
plans which, they hope, will catch the imagination of the public.
Murray Johnstone started the Pep price war in February 1992 when it reduced
the initial charge on all its unit trusts to 1 per cent instead of the
industry norm of 5-6 per cent, and to 1.5 per cent on its unit trust Peps.
Since last October, the initial charge for Peps has dropped to 1 per cent.
This week, Murray Johnstone said it would be waiving the 1 per cent charge
on its five fully-qualifying unit trust Peps until the end of the tax year
on April 5. Since the company does not impose exit charges, investors will
have to pay only the 1.5 per cent annual management fee, although they will
still be subject to the bid/offer spread - the difference in price between
buying and selling the unit trust.
The beneficial effects of low charges have their greatest impact when the
fund also delivers good performance, and Murray Johnstone still leaves
something to be desired in this regard. In the 10, five and three years to
January 1, the four Murray funds (the Acumen does not yet have a five-year
record) have appeared most often in the third quartile (25 per cent).
The table shows those unit trust Peps which have low charges as company
policy rather than because of a limited special offer.
Scottish Equitable is the only one to impose a flat fee of Pounds 45 plus
VAT, instead of an initial charge. The fee is being waived until April 29.
Its annual management charge, however, is higher than those imposed by the
others listed.
In the long run, a high annual charge can be more detrimental to an
investor's returns, while a good fund manager can compensate for the initial
charge through performance over a number of years. But the company points
out that it gives investors a 1 per cent loyalty bonus on the value held in
their Pep on its eighth anniversary.
With the exception of Murray Johnstone, the companies listed all impose
withdrawal fees. A Pep investor into M&amp;G's Managed Income fund - the only
one of M&amp;G's unit trusts where the initial charge has been eliminated -
would pay 4 per cent on the value of his investment if he sold it in the
second year.
Gartmore is the only one of those listed to levy an exit charge on the
initial investment so that any growth is left unscathed by the fee.
Withdrawal charges, common in the US, were introduced on a UK Pep by
Fidelity in June 1992. This week, Fidelity launched two new Peps and has
packaged them to appeal to specific groups.
It is hoping to attract first-time investors into Moneybuilder, the
company's existing fund of funds unit trust, by making it Pepable. There
seems no particular reason why this fund should be more suitable for the
first-time investor than, say, one of Fidelity's UK growth unit trusts.
But Mary Blair, director of product development, says the main reason is
that, as a fund of funds trust, Moneybuilder is invested in a basket of the
company's funds, giving exposure to global as well as UK and European
markets.
The fund is third of 13 listed in the five years to the beginning of
January, with growth of 83 per cent (according to Micropal). As a special
offer, the 2 per cent initial charge on the Pep will be halved until March
11.
At the other end of the market, Fidelity is hoping to attract those planning
to retire within 10-15 years with a new unit trust and Pep. The UK Dividend
Growth fund is due to be launched in just over a fortnight and Blair says:
'It will invest in UK companies with the ability to grow dividends in the
future or in companies which might have cut the dividend for prudent
reasons, but which we believe will have good scope for dividend growth.'
About 60 per cent will be invested in FT-SE 100 stocks and Fidelity is
looking for dividend growth of between 8-10 per cent a year. Thus, this is
not a fund for income-seekers as the initial yield will only be 2 per cent
and the aim is to re-invest the income. The idea is that a large lump sum
will be produced which can be taken tax-free (within the Pep) when the
investor does retire.
Initial charge on Retirement Income Builder (the name of the Pep attached to
the fund) is 2 per cent and, in line with all Fidelity Peps, the exit
charges also apply. Minimum investment in both new Peps is Pounds 1,000, or
Pounds 50 regular monthly savings.

Halifax building society is making its fixed and capped rate mortgages
portable from Tuesday. But existing customers may have to pay a transfer fee
of Pounds 75 when they move their mortgage to a new home.
Halifax's fixed rates include 6.2 per cent (6.6 APR) until April 30 1996;
6.7 per cent (7.1 APR) to the end of April 1997; 7.2 per cent (7.7 APR) to
April 30 1999; and 7.99 per cent (8.6 APR) until April 30 2004. Application
fees are between Pounds 150-250 and there are early redemption penalties.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has issued a new rate of 5.5 per cent (5.7 APR)
fixed for two years for a Pounds 250 application fee. The early redemption
penalty is four months' interest; the mortgage is portable. C&amp;G's five-year
fixed rate at 6.99 per cent is still available.
The society has introduced a discount of 3 percentage points on its standard
variable rate of 7.64 per cent in the first year of the mortgage to those
with a deposit of 20 per cent. This brings down the variable rate to 4.64
per cent (7.7 APR). Applicants with a smaller deposit of 5 per cent or more
are still being offered a discount of 2 percentage points on the standard
rate for the first year.
The Woolwich has replaced its 7.75 per cent seven-year fix with one of 7.5
per cent (8.1 APR if the mortgage is repayment, or 7.9 APR if an endowment).
The application fee is Pounds 295 and there is an early redemption penalty
of six months' interest.
Chelsea building society has issued two new fixed rates. The first is 5.99
per cent (6.4 APR) fixed until June 30 1997 for loans of up to 90 per cent
of the value of the property. The second is a 6.99 per cent (7.6 APR) until
June 30 1999. The administration fee is Pounds 245 and the borrower must
take out the society's buildings and contents insurance for the whole of the
fixed-rate period. The mortgages are portable.
While there are plenty of fixed rates on the market, capped rates are harder
to find. These fix a ceiling on the interest rate and allow the borrower to
benefit from lower rates if interest rates fall below the ceiling.
Yorkshire building society has a number of capped rates. These are 6.10 per
cent until the beginning of January 1996; 6.55 per cent until January 1
1997; and 6.95 per cent capped until January 1 1998. The arrangement fee is
Pounds 250 and early redemption penalties are between three to four months'
loss of interest.
The society's buildings and contents insurance has to be taken out for the
first year. The maximum loan is Pounds 150,000 and the capped rates are all
portable.
Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers is launching a telephone share-dealing service with
a free advisory service. Sharedeal Direct will offer instant dealing
facilities from 8am to 5pm on business days.
Commission on UK equity transactions will be 1.5 per cent, with a minimum of
Pounds 18.50. The service is open to the public and calls to Sharedeal
Direct will be charged at local rates.

The National Association of Pension Funds has issued a pamphlet* aimed at
people who believe that, because they do not plan to remain with one
employer all their lives, there is no point in joining an occupational
scheme since benefits will be lost with each move, writes Norma Cohen.
The pamphlet points out, however, that frozen pension contributions will
continue to rise in line with prices, up to a ceiling of 5 per cent, and
that even those who have left a scheme can qualify for some additional
benefits for their dependents.
The advice comes as government regulators are preparing to review the files
of nearly 500,000 people who may have been persuaded improperly to transfer
their frozen pension assets to a personal pension scheme that makes them
worse off in retirement.
The NAPF is the industry's trade body and its chairman, Ron Amy, says: 'Even
if you do not plan to spend many years in a job, it is still normally worth
joining the pension scheme because you will continue to enjoy the benefits
even after you have left it.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of 'independent' financial advice is dominated by those who get
commissions from companies which have their products recommended. But this
potential conflict of interest - between serving a client's needs and
earning a living - is avoided by a few fee-based advisers who charge clients
for the work done on their behalf. In this article, the first of a series,
Joanna Slaughter talks with one such adviser about how he conducts his
business
Norton Partners hardly fits the popular image of an independent financial
adviser (lFA). The firm has its roots in the accountancy profession and its
small staff works from a converted 16th century granary in the village of
Tickenham, near Bristol.
Although its nominal business is chartered accountancy, Norton Partners
specialises exclusively in personal tax and personal financial management
work. It is the kind of firm that is well-established in the US but
comparatively rare in Britain.
David Norton, the senior partner, explains: 'I tell people that we are
chartered accountants who don't do any chartered accountancy. I think
everyone has to specialise these days and I wanted to specialise in
financial planning.
'When I got rid of all the accounting and auditing in 1989, I think everyone
thought I was mad. We were left with half a practice of existing tax clients
and half a practice that was just a blank piece of paper.'
Norton is chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, a body that
claims to set the toughest professional financial planning examinations in
the country. While the institute welcomes both commission-based and
fee-based IFAs as members, Norton argues: 'The real professional will tend
to become fee-based over time.
'We are trying to create an entire profession where only an industry has
existed in the past. The words financial planning have been hijacked in the
most awful way. If you say you are a financial planner, people think you've
come to flog them life assurance. But one of the key issues about financial
planning is that it is a continuing service; a relationship for life.
'Our whole strategy is to look at clients as if they were a business. We try
to increase their income, save tax and protect them from disaster.'
Norton will not be specific about the size of funds the firm has under
management - 'do you count a client's business expansion scheme holding,
where another party controls the investment?' he asks, with some pertinence
 -but adds: 'You are talking millions.'
He describes his 250 clients as individuals of high net worth. Most are
London-based and made their way to Tickenham as a result of personal
recommendation.
Typically, clients pay a time-based annual fee of around Pounds 3,000 for
the services of Norton Partners, but the fee clock does not start ticking
until after the first meeting. This usually lasts 60 to 90 minutes.
'At this meeting, we establish what their position is; what they are looking
for; whether they like us; and whether we like them,' says Norton.
He will not take on a client whose affairs are not sufficiently detailed to
warrant the fees. Nor will he accept somebody if he feels that they and the
firm will not get on.
After the initial interview, clients are sent a 37-page questionnaire. This
is so detailed that even the respondents' health, habits and hobbies are
logged, together with their partner's mobile telephone number.
The information is processed on a computer. Then a draft plan is produced
and dissected at a comprehensive meeting, which Norton likes clients to
attend with their partners.
He points out: 'We are not really just talking about money. We are talking
about how they can achieve the things they want in life. Our key role is to
be with the client, acting as a bodyguard against the sharks.'
There could be 20 items on the agenda and discussion covers areas such as
income and spending; provision for disability cover; school fee planning;
pension planning; underwriting membership of Lloyd's; investment, life
assurance and estate planning; and risk management.
Norton describes most clients as 'sophisticated' but they can be as prone to
fall into financial bear-traps as anyone. He once had consecutive meetings
with six solicitors and none had made a will.
Norton Partners' approach to financial planning is deliberately holistic,
and it is usual for clients to be seen three times a year. Obviously, not
all clients need all the services the firm offers; investment management is
a stand-alone requirement for a number of them.
Norton describes the firm's investment style as 'pretty risk-averse.' All
clients have some money in cash, some in lower-risk assets such as gilts or
international bonds or zero preference shares, some in index-linked
securities and some in equities.
Portfolios change as little as possible. 'Our basic position is that every
time you change things, it costs money,' says Norton. 'I always make it
clear that we are looking at a five-year term.'
One portfolio, taken at random, had Pounds 14,000 in cash in a building
society; Pounds 6,000 in a Tessa; Pounds 15,000 in overseas bond unit
trusts; Pounds 15,000 in index-linked gilts; Pounds 18,000 in overseas
equity unit trusts and Pounds 12,000 in Peps.
The fee for the firm's initial investment advice will be around 1 per cent
of the value of the portfolio and the typical annual management fee is 0.9
per cent. The firm always rebates any commission in full to clients.
Like every investment manager, Norton has had his successes and his
disappointments. He believes his clients were put into emerging markets at
just the right time but is less happy about the behaviour of the Skandia
Swift fund. This is basically a cash vehicle, investing in Japanese
derivatives, but has not performed.
The sour legacy of investment scandals means that no prospective client of
an lFA can afford to flinch from blunt questions about competence and
security. Norton, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, says he welcomes interrogation.
He gestures to walls which bristle with certificates and says: 'Among our
five professional staff we have 12 professional qualifications and my
colleague, Lin Ashurst, is one of the most highly qualified female financial
planners in the City. We don't handle client money at all and everything is
registered in the client's name.'

BSkyB, a joint venture with (among others) Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, is likely to brighten News International's interim results on
Thursday. In December, the satellite company set a monthly record by adding
140,000 new subscribers, bringing the total to about 3.3m.
Terry Povey, of Bell Securities, is predicting an Pounds 80m contribution
this year to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns 82 per cent of
News International, and one of Pounds 140m in 1995. The price-cutting war in
the UK - while boosting sales of The Sun and The Times - is likely to cost
about Pounds 43.3m in the 1994 financial year.
BAA, the airports' operator, is to report quarterly results for the first
time. On Tuesday, it is to release figures for the first nine months of the
year to March 30. Analysts are shy of forecasting for the third quarter but
anticipate that full-year profits will fall between Pounds 312m and Pounds
325m. Again, the main engine of growth is expected to be the retailing side
although improved productivity and cost-cutting throughout the group will
have their impact.
Flat earnings' growth is being forecast for Fyffes, the UK and Irish fresh
fruit distributor, which is due to reveal results for the year to October 31
on Wednesday. Stockbrokers in Dublin anticipate pre-tax profits of between
IPounds 29.5m and IPounds 30.5m, up from IPounds 28.5m in 1992. This would
be the equivalent to earnings per share of 5.9p to 6p (5.9p). Softness in
banana prices and falling interest rates  - the latter affecting income from
the company's IPounds 95m cash hoard - are viewed as the main factors
holding back growth.
Numbers are expected to be of little importance at ML Laboratories, which
announces its final results on Monday. Of far more interest will be ML's
distribution plans for the renal dialysis drug which last year won its UK
marketing licence. Investors are also likely to focus on just how much cash
there is in the bank at the bio-tech company, which has not made a profit
since its float in 1987.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: F&amp;C makes it clear - Personal
pension plan is so easy to understand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the many individual pension products on the market, it is always
welcome to see new plans that combine the two features investors seek most:
good long-term performance and clear, flexible charges.
Foreign &amp; Colonial* Investment Trust, operated by the oldest and largest
company in the field, has extended its popular share-savers scheme to offer
the first investment trust pension products.
The F&amp;C personal pension is available to the self-employed and to directors
and employees who are not members of a company scheme. The free-standing
additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan can be used by employees who
are members of company schemes but wish to top up their benefits.
Investment trusts, which are companies quoted on the stock exchange, can
borrow to provide gearing, invest in a very wide range of listed and
unlisted securities, and hedge any currency risk.
Of the 5m personal pension plans sold, an estimated 97 per cent are life
office products, including most of those sold by building societies and
banks. But the large sale commissions associated with personal pensions,
combined with hefty management charges and punitive early termination
penalties, have undermined their potential success.
The track record of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust is solid and
consistent, offering prospects for long-term growth that rival the best in
the insured sector. The charges are so low, and expressed so clearly, that
they put to shame the notoriously convoluted life office structure.
The trust has been operating for 125 years and has a broadly-based
international portfolio worth Pounds 1.7bn, with more than 70,000
shareholders. UK and international equities form the bulk of the portfolio
and account for the consistent top quartile performance in the international
sector for investment trusts over a 10-year period.
For both the personal pension and FSAVC, there is a Pounds 100 set-up fee
for any investment size plus a Pounds 50 annual administration fee from year
two and a plan management fee of 0.5 per cent. The dealing charge on share
purchases is 0.2 per cent, with stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. There is no
penalty for varying or stopping contributions and no loading for sales
commission.
Minimum contributions are Pounds 100 a month, Pounds 1,000 a year, or Pounds
5,000 for lump sums. Personal Pension Management will act as scheme trustee
and administrator.
The plan is divided into 10 segments so that individuals can phase their
retirement. They are granted full shareholders' rights to vote and attend
the annual general meeting of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust.
Provident Life is launching a product which aims to overcome one of the most
inflexible aspects of money purchase pensions such as personal pensions,
retirement annuity contracts and executive pensions.
Under a money purchase pension, contributions are invested to build up a
fund which, in turn, is used immediately at retirement to buy an annuity.
Once this is purchased, it cannot be changed.
Moreover, the level of income provided by the annuity depends on the value
of the fund and annuity rates at the time. Unfortunately, these rates, which
are determined by underlying interest rates, can fluctuate dramatically.
Provident Life's flexible annuity portfolio is expected to be launched in
February. The concept of flexible or managed annuities is still relatively
new - Equitable Life launched the first of these in October 1993.
Provident's plan allows the client to retain control over investment of the
fund while providing a basic minimum annual income of Pounds 7,500 (higher
for those who need more). It offers a wide choice of investments. These
include managed equity funds run by Schroders, commercial property, fixed
interest and deposit funds, authorised unit trusts and investment trusts,
and UK and overseas equities.
The initial set-up charge is 1 per cent of the fund value, while the
subsequent annual charge is 0.5 per cent. There is no loading for sales
commission. Provident Life is unlikely to consider funds under Pounds
200,000 for the flexible annuity portfolio.
A note of caution, though: investors approaching retirement who have
substantial money purchase pension funds, and who are interested in the
control and flexibility offered by this type of product, should seek
professional independent advice.
*Foreign &amp; Colonial has set up a pensions helpline for savers on 0722-320
102. It will answer technical questions on eligibility, contribution
amounts, tax relief etc. It will not give investment advice.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Forte spreads wings - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte is spinning off its airport services division, which will become known
as Alpha Airports Group and have a market capitalisation of Pounds 211.1m,
writes David Blackwell. Shares in the company, the turnover of which is
roughly divided between in-flight catering and retail outlets at airports,
have been priced at 140p. Pro forma earnings per share are 8.75p, giving a
multiple of 16.
Half of the 113.09m ordinary shares are being placed firmly by UBS with
institutions. A quarter of the total (39.58m) will be subject to a clawback
to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Forte is retaining the
remaining 25 per cent. The total value of the flotation to Forte, including
Alpha's assumption of total debts of Pounds 30m, is Pounds 241m.
The price looks seems to be pitched about right for both Forte and potential
investors. The flight catering side should benefit from growth in
international air travel, which should also provide the less profitable
retail side with more customers. Alpha is expecting profits to rise 19 per
cent to Pounds 20.6m on turnover of Pounds 423.1m for the year ending
January 31. The City is looking for growth of around 13 per cent in the
coming year, giving earnings of 10p.
The many bio-technology companies coming to the market is about to be
weighed down with another arrival - Chiroscience, the developer of single
isomer drugs, writes Tim Burt. Single isomers differ from most organic drugs
because they act faster and with fewer side-effects than existing twin
isomer products.
At first glance, such companies are not enticing. Profits are unlikely for
some years and their research could prove fruitless if regulatory approval
is withheld. But if the drugs fulfil their promise, the rewards are rich.
Chiroscience claims it can reduce the risk while holding out the prospect of
a major breakthrough by 1998. It has offset recent losses through sales of
single isomer compounds, or synthons, which earned Pounds 1.34m in the six
months to August 31.
Nevertheless, development of its own single isomer products requires major
investment - hence the float. The offer and placing by Robert Fleming is
expected to raise Pounds 36m, primarily to develop the single isomer
business. But analysts are not sure the potential breakthrough warrants a
price of 150p. Applications close on Thursday.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: How to do it
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EU law says nationals in all member countries must be given an equal
opportunity to take stakes in EU privatisation flotations. Implementing this
law could be difficult, though, and the transactions are complicated by the
currency risk. Then, there are practical difficulties.
The British government marketed its issues vigorously to the private
investor. But continental European governments are said to be less willing
to help foreign nationals to profit from the sale of their national assets -
an attitude that has prompted grumblings about allocations for UK investors.
Other difficulties include the likely need for overseas banking facilities
and the complex arrangements for the taxation of dividends held across EU
borders both for the payor company and the individual recipient.
Then, too, it is difficult to know when the issues will come to the market.
There is no central EU information source and individual government
authorities can be elusive. Once issues are announced, it can be difficult
to uncover information in English about the business and prospects of the
corporate assets.
Issues are not always accompanied by retail prospectuses in English,
although these have been translated for institutional investors. But many
issues are of stock in companies already partly-quoted. The largest produce
annual reports in English, available on request. Almost the only other
source is the pages of the English-language financial media.
As one seasoned private investor puts it, buying shares directly under these
conditions would be like 'playing darts blindfold.' All but the most
tenacious and linguistically-confident private investor should seek
professional help.
There are two ways into the cross-border new issues market via professionals
. . .
1. Buying through a fund
Two new investment trusts aimed at small shareholders interested in the
privatisation stocks are being offered. These will deal with such
difficulties as foreign currency transactions, overseas banking facilities
and withholding tax on dividends.
Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation investment trust provides the
chance (closing on February 2) to buy partly-paid shares, with 50 per cent
payable on application and the rest six months later. Annual management
charge is 0.75 per cent and minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Mercury Asset Management's European Privatisation trust will be launched on
February 3. Like the Kleinwort issue, it will have warrants attached on a
1-for-5 basis and will qualify for inclusion in a Pep.
Full details of the Mercury offer are not yet available to private
investors, but the offer price will be 100p a share and the annual
management fee less than 1 per cent. Minimum investment will be Pounds
1,000.
'Since most trusts now start trading at a premium, the 'free' warrants are
an additional attraction and are likely to enhance the value of the total
investment because they are ultimately tradeable,' says John Szymanowski,
investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities.
The MAM ordinary shares will be traded as a package with their warrants for
the first 43 days of listing, so investors can include the warrants inside a
Pep. The Kleinwort warrants are tradeable separately from day one.
2. Buying through a broker
For those who want to stag their stocks, the trusts are not appropriate. For
this, you can choose to use your existing broker or one of the brokers which
offer specialist European privatisation services.
European Stockbrokers Ltd has launched an execution-only service for UK
private investors who want to deal in European shares. The company also is
offering private clients a custody service, a choice of nominee or own-name
dealings, portfolio valuations, and holding of sterling or foreign currency
in an interest-bearing deposit account.
Commission charges for execution-only transactions are 0.5 per cent on deals
up to Pounds 60,000, with a minimum of Pounds 100 and maximum of Pounds 250,
plus 0.25 per cent on the balance of transactions above Pounds 60,000. There
are additional charges for local delivery of overseas shares, and a small
charge for the custody service.
Even more specialised is the Johnson Fry Managed French Privatisation
Service to private investors in the UK. Johnson Fry is inviting investments
of Pounds 1,000 and will then apply for shares in every French privatisation
issue on behalf of each investor. The shares will be sold as soon as
possible so that the proceeds can be re-invested in subsequent issues.
Charges are Pounds 60 to cover all applications, with a flat fee of Pounds
15 on sales of shares worth less than Pounds 500 and Pounds 22 on larger
amounts. No interest will be paid to investors on the money held.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Now Europe goes private - The big
sell-offs planned on the Continent this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The word privatisation sends pound signs flashing before the eyes of anyone
who shared in the generous returns from the sale of Britain's state assets
to the private sector in the 1980s. Many UK private investors will be hoping
for similarly rich pickings from privatisation issues worth about Pounds
75bn which are planned by European Union governments and for which all EU
nationals have an equal chance to subscribe.
Almost every EU government plans to sell at least a few corporate assets
soon. Many are in high-yielding sectors such as telecommunications,
utilities, energy and finance. This means that some of the privatisation
stocks could give investors almost the same yield available from a building
society account, with the added benefit of potential capital growth - and a
commensurate risk of loss.
The planned sales include the French government's 51 per cent stake in the
country's largest industrial company, the oil group Elf Aquitaine; KPN, the
Dutch telecommunications company, due to be sold before the end of June; and
the Italian government's projected disposal of its controlling stake in
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big Rome-based financial services group.
Will European offers be a good buy?
So far, some issues have gone better than expected and none has flopped. In
France, where the most ambitious continental privatisation programme is
under way, the first two issues - Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the
country's biggest banks, and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group - were
over-subscribed heavily by both individual and institutional investors.
Profits before costs, seen in early dealings, were 21 per cent and 11 per
cent respectively on local applications.
But will the European privatisations be similar to those in the UK? There
are two main aspects: the initial pricing and subsequent performance.
A study by the London Business School showed that an investor holding a
basket of UK privatisation stocks*, bought at flotation and sold after one
week, would have realised a 32 per cent increase in capital value compared
with a market average of 0.2 per cent. By keeping the basket until October 1
1988, the investor could have increased the capital value by 166 per cent
compared with a 77 per cent market average.
This indicates that a substantial proportion of the total gain was earned in
the first week, which suggests that the British government's pricing policy
was highly significant in contributing to the high returns on UK
privatisation stocks.
Pricing policy across the EU is likely to vary between countries and assets.
Moreover, the volume of privatisation stock could stretch international
markets. A survey of 55 investment professionals around the world by
Burson-Marsteller Financial, a UK investor relations practice, concluded:
'Respondents suggested that the number of privatisations currently or about
to take place in European countries, such as France, Italy, Spain, Germany
and the Netherlands would put strains on international capital markets as
they try to absorb the vast amounts being raised.'
Others are optimistic. Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at
Morgan Stanley, says: 'The conditions for European equity markets are
generally positive for the longer term. With interest rates falling and
inflation running at low levels, the only nagging query is a general lack of
growth for now.' He believes people will switch their cash and
fixed-interest investments into the new issues.
British privatisation stocks were popular partly because investors saw scope
for improving productivity gains by cutting labour costs. But high
unemployment across much of continental Europe could weaken the resolve of
governments to confront organised labour. Last October the French government
withdrew a pre-privatisation, cost-cutting plan at loss-making Air France in
the face of an industrial dispute that caused chaos.
Some equity strategists are suggesting that job losses of about 10 per cent
across the Continent will be needed to match the rationalisations necessary
for productivity gains shown by privatised companies in Britain. But some of
the assets preparing to float do not have great scope for such gains. This
is because they are run along commercial lines already - for example, Elf
Aquitaine and the third tranche in Spain's Argentaria bank.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Are equities heading for nirvana? - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who can blame the equity market for pausing to take stock when the Tories
tax like Labour and Lonrho reports like Hanson?
'Total deception,' thundered Labour as it challenged the Tories claim to be
the low-taxers, when come April the Tory tax take will hit a record 32.9 per
cent of average earners' income.
'There are no differences between Mr Bock and me . . . We will be acting as
one,' beamed Tiny Rowland as peace broke out again at Lonrho. Clearly, the
company's charismatic founder and Dieter Bock, his heir presumptive, fancy
new roles to play. Perhaps they were rehearsing a double act along the lines
of Lords White and Hanson.
Consumer sensitive stocks wobbled on the tax news and Lonrho shares hit a
two-year high, providing two of the few highlights in a week in which the
market drifted lower and trading volumes eased. The FT-SE 100 fell for the
first four days but recovered some yesterday to end the week down a net 36.8
points at 3,447.4.
Shares were a shade unsettled after Wednesday's gilts auction was less
successful than hoped. Appetite for the Pounds 2.75bn of gilts was weaker
and bidding less aggressive than at the previous auction. But nobody
believes the government faces a funding problem this year.
A reminder of gilts' attractiveness came from BZW in its 39th annual review
of investment returns. For the third time in five years gilts performed
best, notching up a real total return of 26.4 per cent last year. Equities,
despite all the market excitement, trailed at 25 per cent.
Do not worry that stocks are now modestly overvalued on a dividend yield
model, BZW advised investors. The bull market has plenty of life in it
thanks to stimulative monetary policy and rising corporate profits which are
claiming a growing share of GDP. If stocks were as overvalued as they were
at the last peak in 1968, the FT-SE 100 would be trading at 5,500.
'I think the market has given up listening to analysts - that's what the
sheer weight of money has done to it,' said one of the City's most
persistent bears. He has argued strongly for a market retreat since the
FT-SE 100 first challenged 3,100 but the torrent of money into the market
has kept it rising.
Not just the institutions have money to invest in equities. Last year, for
example, a record Pounds 9.1bn - the bulk from private investors - poured
into unit trusts. Investment trust launches took another Pounds 2.2bn, three
times their record.
The decision to switch money into equities is captured in the accompanying
chart of funds flows of the personal sector in the UK. In 1988, individuals
were still disinvesting from equities. The tide turned in 1992 and picked up
last year, reflecting equities' attractiveness as interest rates fell.
With people piling into equities, are we heading for an equity nirvana where
stock tips spout forth from the mouths of elevator boys?
Optimism is high but drama low, said Mary Blair, product development
director for Fidelity, the UK fund manager. 'We have had a high volume of
calls from customers since last autumn. But before Christmas many calls were
administrative . . . such as checking on balances. Now people are saying 'I
want to invest'.' Even so, 'they are a little more controlled, more sensible
in their choice of investments than in 1987.'
There is no sign yet of a panicky rush into equities, said Robin Aspinall,
market strategist at Panmure Gordon. 'It's a liquidity push to stocks, not a
price pull.'
He worries that the liquidity will dry up sooner rather than later. It is
impossible to forecast when the investment tide will turn but at some point
investors will begin to hesitate over equities because, for example, of an
upward turn in interest rates. 'You don't have to take money out of the
market . . . just a reduction in the inward flow would start the downward
spiral.'
Cash flow was very much on the mind of supermarkets this week as first Wm
Low, the Scottish chain, and J Sainsbury, the sector leader, delivered
disturbing news of their tighter circumstances. Dealers took a leaf out of
the supermarkets' own trading manuals and sharply cut share prices to clear
surplus stock.
The sector, revelling in historically high margins, had romped through the
recession building expensive superstores with abandon. Then shoppers grew
picky about prices and discounters began harrying the full-service chains.
First Asda called the turn and adjusted its strategy, joined two weeks ago
by Tesco with its own news of writedowns and a shift to smaller stores. This
week Low, particularly hard hit by discounters, admitted its like-for-like
sales had actually fallen and margins trimmed in its first half.
Finally yesterday, Sainsbury fell into line. Its like-for-like sales and
margins had fallen, it was writing off over-valued sites and starting to
depreciate its assets. No-one doubts Sainsbury's clout, but it will not be
using it to such profitable effect in the future.
Elsewhere in the retail sector, Christmas sales continued to sort out the
good from the indifferent and bad. Burton joined Dixons and Kingfisher in
the third category. Next and MFI joined Storehouse, Signet and Laura Ashley
in the first group.
Burton was particularly disappointing. On Thursday, it delivered the worst
of all possible scenarios: flat sales and falling margins, even from its
revamped chains such as Top Shop and Principles.
But cash flow was pushed into the shadows at Lonrho's headquarters when it
announced results on Tuesday. The fact that the group can still barely
generate enough cash from continuing operations to cover interest, dividends
and tax was a sideshow. The limelight was on the Tiny-Dieter duet.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Fee-based advice may be the answer - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reader telephoned recently to say that he had Pounds 80,000 in the
building society. He knew this was a lot to keep on deposit but did not know
where to go for advice because he could not 'trust' anyone. He said he did
not want to consult an independent financial adviser because the advice
would be influenced by the commission received on the sale of investment
products.
This is a position in which many people can find themselves. It is one
reason why today we are beginning a series of profiles of fee-based
independent financial advisers around the UK (see Page V) .
The complex structure of salesmen, tied agents and independent financial
advisers which characterises the financial services industry, is not an easy
one in which to find impartial advice. It is difficult to know, for example,
which of the alphabet soup of regulators is meant to be on the business card
of an eager adviser.
This confusion was highlighted in a recent survey in Money Week, a trade
publication. It found that, although 44 per cent of those surveyed said they
were certain they knew what was meant by the term independent financial
adviser, on further questioning it was clear most did not.
Independent financial advisers are distinguished from the rabble of sales
agents by the word 'independent'. However, independent in this context
simply means being independent of having to recommend the products of a sole
company - most IFAs still rely for their living on the commission they are
paid by the companies providing the products they recommend to the public.
People think they are getting 'free' advice' but they are paying for that
commission through increased premiums or charges on the products. The system
is open to abuse because investments may be recommended which are not in the
best interests of the client but earn the IFA commission.
Now, there are many diligent IFAs who want to build up a long-term
relationship with clients, and work hard to make sure that they are happy.
They will therefore include investments such as National Savings, which pay
no commission, in the hope of keeping their clients' business and picking up
more through personal recommendation.
However, there are many IFAs who are not so scrupulous and the potential for
abuse is not confined to small, sleazy outfits. Last December, Noble Lowndes
and Partners, one of the UK's largest chain of IFAs, was fined Pounds
740,000 by the regulators for switching people out of their occupational
pension schemes and into personal pensions without proper documentation,
sometimes against the obvious interests of the client.
But change is afoot. From next year, investors must be told how much
commission salesmen and advisers earn. This should mean that a client will
know that their IFA will get 5 per cent in commission for selling them a
single premium investment bond, but 3 per cent on a unit trust.
Commission disclosure has been fiercely resisted by the life industry but
although some of the arguments have merit, others are worryingly
self-interested.
One IFA was quoted in the trade press recently complaining about an incident
in which one of his clients had found another IFA willing to split the
commission on a deal he had recommended. The IFA sounded dire warnings that
commission disclosure would result in investors 'shopping around' for the
best deal - as if this were an outrageous thing to do.
Unfortunately commission disclosure is very much a partial solution. The
wool will still be pulled over most investors' eyes since it is likely to
result in the industry restructuring the way in which commission is paid.
Instead of taking the commission upfront, IFAs are likely to be paid less
initially, taking most of the commission spread over the first years of the
life of a policy or investment. The increased costs of administering
commission steadily over the years will inevitably be passed on to the
consumer.
The FT has consistently taken the line that fee-based advice is more likely
to result in impartial advice. This is not to say that it is always bound to
be better. After all, there are plenty who have paid expensive accountants
or lawyers fees and been dissatisfied. However, if the client pays for
advice, that advice is more likely to be unbiased.
When it is in a positive mood, the industry's reply to this is that it too
would welcome fee-based advice but clients are not prepared to pay for it.
But this is because consumers think they are getting 'free advice' when they
go to a commission-based IFA.
At the moment, consumers who buy investments through an IFA are paying for
the many who take up the IFA's time, but do not end up doing business. If a
system of disclosure is put into place which allows investors to know
clearly how much they are paying through the commission system, it should
not be long before they are happy to pay fees for financial advice instead.
Only then, can people like our reader feel able to trust their IFA.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Lonrho keeps them guessing - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'He has done everything we could reasonably have expected of him. But Lonrho
is still a long way from being a mainstream investment for us because we
still know so little about him.'
These comments about Lonrho's joint chief executive, Dieter Bock, were made
by the head of a substantial UK investment institution earlier this week
after Lonrho published its first annual results since Bock joined the
company early in 1993.
His mission has been to make Lonrho - which, for 30 years, has been the
vehicle of Tiny Rowland - into a more normal company. For all his skirmishes
with Rowland over the past few months, Bock is not feeling too unhappy about
progress. After all, he is sitting on an unrealised profit of more than
Pounds 70m on his 18.8 per cent Lonrho shareholding.
The share price rise, from a low of 59p in October 1992 to 155p yesterday,
stems from some genuine changes at the company. The balance sheet has been
strengthened by the sale of businesses and assets for Pounds 322m, reducing
the ratio of net debt to equity from 57 per cent to 31 per cent.
A complicated corporate structure has been simplified by focusing the
company on four core divisions: mining, hotels, agriculture and general
trading. Further dealings with Libya - in the form of a joint venture to
finance a film about the Lockerbie bombing - have been halted.
Finally, Bock has ended Rowland's domination of the board. First, he secured
the appointment of three non-executive directors, the company's first for 20
years. Then, only a few days ago, he persuaded four long-serving executive
directors - all of them above the normal retirement age at most other
companies and all close supporters of Rowland - to step down.
Even the expensive legal battle against the Fayed brothers over their 1985
purchase of House of Fraser, which cost Lonrho up to Pounds 5m in 1993
alone, has been ended following a highly theatrical reconciliation between
Rowland and his long-standing adversaries.
Further progress could be slower in coming, though. The company is still
much less transparent than most because so many of its important businesses
are in Africa (generating 90 per cent of profit from continuing operations
last year) and depend to an indeterminable extent on Rowland's relationship
with local rulers.
Nor is Bock's strategy entirely clear. The general trade division is a
catch-all, giving no clue to further asset disposals or future acquisitions.
Lonrho's recent share price rises have been dictated to a large extent by
estimates of net asset value which, including the company's 45 per cent
shareholding in Ashanti Goldfields at market price, is probably in excess of
180p per share. But Bock has yet to demonstrate that he can increase
revenues and profit margins: the return on assets from continuing operations
was an unremarkable 6 per cent after tax last year.
Even if profits from these continuing operations were to rise by 50 per cent
to around Pounds 120m before tax this year, the shares would still be
trading on a price/earnings ratio of more than 20, which is hardly cheap
given the uncertainties.
The balance sheet will be strengthened further in the coming months,
however, by the stock market flotation of Ashanti. There is also a chance -
given any resurgence in US inflationary pressures - that commodity companies
such as Lonrho with its vast gold, platinum, coal and food interests could
return to stock market fashion.
The next stage in Bock's 'normalisation' campaign is to persuade investment
institutions to end their near-boycott of the shares (they own around a
third of the equity, a low proportion).
One big institution has started recently to accumulate shares; but the
choice of a new chairman to replace Rene Leclezio who is retiring, will be
crucial in determing if other investors do the same.
The institutions want someone with a background in international business
whom they respect and who will have the time to visit all Lonrho's dispersed
businesses. As one fund manager said: 'We want someone to kick the tyres.'

<TEXT>
The flow of money into investment trusts through savings schemes more than
doubled to a record Pounds 239.61m last year, an increase of 107 per cent
from the 1992 figure of Pounds 115.5m.
Investment trust savings schemes, which allow investors to put regular small
amounts or lump sums towards building up a holding in a trust, were first
introduced in 1984 but took several years to gain popularity. The total
invested through this method has mushroomed from Pounds 89,000 in 1984 and
Pounds 22.5m in 1988, to Pounds 64m in 1989, and Pounds 119.5m in 1991.
The average monthly saving is now Pounds 80, and the average lump sum
investment is Pounds 1,830. There are are almost 71,000 savings scheme
accounts. A total of 36 management companies now offer schemes covering 155
investment trusts.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Within striking distance of 4,000 - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next stop 4,000? The Dow Jones industrial average seems within striking
distance of this psychological marker as it continues its record-breaking
rally, in spite of a pause for breath at the start of this week.
The main reason: further evidence that while the economy is growing
strongly, inflation remains subdued, which should alleviate pressures for an
early tightening of credit.
This benign combination was underlined yesterday morning with the release of
GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 1993, showing the economy growing at
an annual rate of 5.9 per cent, ahead of Wall Street forecasts, pitched at
around 5.2 per cent.
However, the bond market, which usually fears strong growth, took the GDP
figures in its stride because they were accompanied by statistics showing
lower-than-expected inflation.
In addition, economists do not expect the fourth quarter growth rate, which
was boosted by special factors, to be sustained in the first quarter of this
year, particularly in view of the severe winter weather which has hit the
east of the US and the Los Angeles earthquake.
Stock markets, which paused on Monday and Tuesday after the previous week's
strong run, resumed their upward advance on Wednesday, buoyed by a rally in
the Dow Jones Utility Average, which some regard as a leading indicator of
interest rate trends.
The bullish tone was underpinned by yesterday's figures, and at lunchtime
the Dow stood at 3,943.74, up 17.44 on the day and 29.26 on the week.
Interest-rate sensitive stocks, such as banks and insurance companies, which
have suffered recently because of fears of tightening credit, rallied in the
second half of the week on the back of the better bond market sentiment.
And bank stocks were further enlivened on Friday when California-based
BankAmerica, the largest bank on the West Coast and the second-largest in
the US, announced a Dollars 1.9bn bid for Continental Bank, the
Chicago-based wholesale group which specialises in corporate lending.
The takeover, the latest in a long-term consolidation of the US banking
industry, is the first big move by BankAmerica to diversify geographically
from its west coast base, and the acquisition will make it a substantial
presence in the economically buoyant midwest.
For Continental, the bid represents a final chapter in its recovery from the
dark days of 1984, when the bank had to be rescued by Federal authorities
from near collapse.
Hopes of sustained economic growth have also given a fillip over the past
week to companies in cyclical sectors, whose fortunes tend to follow those
of the economic cycle. The movement has been reinforced by encouraging
fourth quarter results from some leading capital and intermediate goods
manufacturers.
Shares in Caterpillar, the heavy plant and machinery maker, have performed
strongly since the group reported good figures on January 21, and the stock
got a further boost with Thursday's news that US durable goods orders rose
2.2 per cent in December, the fifth consecutive monthly advance.
A good run of results from steel-makers, buoyed by strong demand from car
manufacturers and construction companies, continued this week with
better-than-expected figures from Bethlehem Steel, the second largest
company in the sector, which forecast a further improvement in demand
through 1994.
However, International Business Machines cast gloom over the market on
Tuesday when it reported fourth quarter earnings which were lower than
forecast, and an unexpected decline in sales.
IBM did manage to get back into the black - its first quarterly profit in
more than a year - but the figures showed just how far Lou Gerstner, now
coming up to his first anniversary as chairman, still has to go to restore
the business to robust financial health.
IBM's sales of mainframe computers, on which it remains highly dependent,
fell 30 per cent in the quarter, which more than offset a 35 per cent surge
in sales of lower-margin personal computers and a 4 per cent increase in
workstation sales.
Jerome York, IBM's chief financial officer, has been slashing the company's
bloated cost base, taking Dollars 2.8bn out of expenses in 1993. He plans a
further Dollars 3bn cut this year, which may be enough to offset falling
profits from mainframes.
His forecast that the company will break-even in the first quarter helped
stabilise IBM stock after a tumble early on Tuesday morning. As York told
analysts: 'This ain't a candy store on Main Street, and it won't be turned
around in one or two quarters.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / What's up doc?: They're tired, worn out, stressed and
depressed. Round-the-clock working is to blame, says Dr Julia Riley, who
argues that patients need a disincentive to make out-of-hours calls on their
doctors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr JULIA RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I came to Britain seven years ago, I was very sceptical about the
grumbles of doctors in general practice. Having trained and worked abroad
before becoming a GP in the UK, I found little for them to complain about.
Consider:
The intended average net annual income for a GP in Britain is Pounds 40,600.
A principal receiving this salary is expected to be available to patients
for 26 hours a week. An average GP spends about 15 hours consulting and
10-11 hours visiting each week. The rest of the time is supposed to be spent
on administration.
Doctors may also offer clinics (such as baby clinics), but these are not
compulsory.
In a well organised practice, therefore, the work is not onerous. In
addition:
The Cost Rent Scheme provides an interest-free loan towards the cost of new
premises of adequate standard. These premises eventually become a capital
asset for the partnership.
The job of a general practitioner is very secure compared with those of
other professionals.
I could not believe that GPs had it so easy - until I became one.
Then I found there is one big exception to all these advantages - and it
clouded my whole life: the GP's 24-hour commitment to visiting patients in
their homes. This is much the greatest, and I believe, a most unnecessary
stress faced by the GP. It requires the GP to offer home visits at night,
every night, 365 nights of the year.
Night visits and out-of-hours calls became the bane of my life. I was not
alone, as a recent survey of GPs showed.
When I worked in general practice outside the UK, the doctor was called at
night when the problem could not wait until the morning. The person calling
the doctor had to decide whether the cost of a night visit was justified. I
do not remember an unnecessary call being made.
On a recent visit to the US, I was fascinated to observe the process from a
parent's point of view. Shortly after midnight, the baby in the home in
which I was staying became unwell. He had a fever, was miserable and cried
incessantly. His parents became alarmed and equally distressed. They had
tried pain-killers several times but the baby screamed all the louder.
I was asked to have a look at him. I said the child was teething and that he
would eventually settle. Despite this reassurance and having a doctor in the
house, his parents called the doctor. But in the US, doctors do not
routinely make night calls: if medical treatment is required, the patient
goes to the surgery.
A dialogue followed between the parents and the doctor. Was the call
necessary? Was it urgent? Could it wait for the morning? It was cold, was it
fair to take the baby all the way down town in the foul weather? It would
cost Pounds 70: was this necessary? What else could be done?
It was decided to wait and see. The baby took his time but finally slept
soundly.
This little scene would have had developed quite differently in the UK. The
parents would have gone straight to the telephone and called the doctor. The
doctor would perhaps have written a prescription to justify the visit, and
an angry, frustrated doctor would have left knowing he had made a night
visit for 'teething'.
The US family was certainly distressed, but the wisdom of calling the doctor
as a first resort must be questioned. If there is no disincentive to calling
the doctor, why should patients think about whether a doctor is really
needed?
Home visiting in Britain has increased fivefold over 25 years. In 1992-3,
there were about 164,000 night visits in England at a cost of Pounds 70m.
Dr John Chisholm, deputy chairman of the General Medical Services Council
said recently: 'There is no underlying clinical explanation for the rise in
demand, and the system has reached a point of collapse.'
My reply is that the NHS has removed the responsibility of personal health
and first aid from the patient and landed it in the lap of the GPs. This
results in increased demand and abuse of the system which could ultimately
cause its collapse.
As soon as a doctor receives a call he takes on a professional
responsibility: a simple fever could be meningitis; the person explaining
the problem over the telephone may be far from accurate; the patient may
insist on a visit (which they have a right to do).
This leaves the GPs in a dilemma: do they give advice on the phone and worry
that all will be well; or do they make what is usually an unnecessary visit.
During a year as a GP in London I found very few out-of-hours calls that
were, in my opinion, justified. No doctor objects to visiting patients in
need - not a doctor in the land would object to arriving at a home where a
diabetic is uncontrolled, an asthmatic is short of breath, or a patient with
angina has crushing chest pain. Indeed, it is very satisfying to be able to
help in such cases.
The average GP is on a one-in-four rota, which means he is on call one in
four nights and one in four weekends. But only a third of British doctors
have access to a deputising service, which means most work all day and then
take on further responsibilities at night.
The night calls then become a constant frustration: the patient has power to
demand a visit, without the responsibility of assessing the need.
Employing a deputising service is not a satisfactory answer, however, as the
GP then has to pay for the visits requested by the patients of that
practice.
And the deputising service system is open to abuse. A friend of mine was
recently a locum for a deputising agency in order to supplement his income.
On one visit, the door was answered by a woman who said: 'I am so glad you
have come. The pipe burst and the water is everywhere.'
Bemused, he replied, 'I think you are mistaken, I am the doctor, and I think
you need a plumber.'
'Oh, I know you are the doctor, but the plumber would not come and I knew
that you would.'
In true British spirit, he mended the pipe.
I left general practice 15 months ago, so for an up-to-date assessment of
how badly the system is working, I called a friend and former colleague at
about 8.30 on a Sunday evening: 'How are you?' I asked. 'Don't ask,' came an
instant reply. 'I am on call, the weekend is not over, and I have already
had 45 calls.'
'How many of the calls were necessary?' I asked. 'Well that is a matter of
opinion. The patients thought 45 calls were necessary. If you want my
opinion . . . I admitted one patient to hospital, and another five were
reasonable calls.'
What is the solution? Education might help, but is a slow process. Nothing
will educate the public faster than a disincentive, such as mention of the
word 'payment'.
Unfortunately, the word is anathema to those working in the health service.
Magnanimously, they will proclaim that it should provide 'free' care to all.
So what about emergency centres? These are to be introduced from April and
could bring about big changes. Patients will be asked to go to these
centres, staffed by GPs and nurses, rather than have the doctor visit them
in their homes. No charge will be made.
This is an excellent idea, combining care, free service and a disincentive
for unnecessary use. The patient rather than the doctor must decide whether
a trip to the emergency centre is needed.
Emergency centre pilot schemes indicate that the number of home visits can
be halved, since home visits are made only to those who cannot get to the
centre.
But the idea still has its detractors. One common argument is that people
want care from their own doctors, which is fine in principle. But an
emergency is an emergency. In such circumstances all that is needed is a
competent doctor to take care of the acute episode.
Aftercare can be taken over the following morning by the patient's own GP,
who will have enjoyed an undisturbed night, be less stressed, less grumpy
and better able to deal with the continuation of care from the night's
emergencies as well as treatment of the other patients due to see him that
day.
The introduction of the emergency service will not exclude all home visits.
According to Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the GMSC, home visits will be made
when the patient would be harmed by travel, for example.
Having left general practice, I now work full time in Palliative Medicine
(terminal care). We make home visits all the time and the pleasure is ours:
home visits will continue to be a central theme of our care in the
community.
It is surprising, however, how seldom the elderly or seriously ill request a
visit. They are all too often heard saying 'I did not want to disturb the
doctor'.
In a nationwide GMSC survey, 84 per cent of GPs supported the concept of
primary emergency centres. There are plenty of reasons for these centres to
succeed: in educating patients; in making patients responsible for decisions
on their own care; in reducing patients' expectation of an overburdened
health service; and in decreasing stress for doctors.
After the patients' charters, this could be the first step towards a Doctors
Charter - and they could certainly do with one as I believe them to easily
exploited. Doctors for generations have worked ridiculous hours, given their
all, survived - and even enjoyed it.
I applaud the emergency service scheme, because it attends to the needs of
the partnership between GPs and their patients.
Health care, the link in this partnership, is now seen as a commodity and
like any other commodity it has a value. It needs to be perceived as such by
patients and professionals.
When I first came to the UK seven years ago, I remember how surprised I was
to experience a 'cost free' service. No one asked the cost of a drug, an
investigation, an ambulance trip . . . I could go on all day. What we
prescribed was never questioned, it was simply given. It was utopia. The
bubble had to burst.
Awareness of costs is the first step to efficient use of a limited resource,
even if attaching price tags to health care is disagreeable.
Today, doctors have a new perception of the cost of the service which gives
a new meaning to ideas of quality and value.
Now, patients' perception of the cost of the service also needs to change.
Patients need to respect it, value it, take responsibility for their own
health and use the service only when appropriate. This is a true basic that
we should get back to.

FT  29 JAN 94 / The Long View: When debt lingers on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the American locomotive at last picking up speed and beginning to pull
the stagnant global economy out of the sidings? Yesterday's preliminary
estimate of US gross national product growth of 5.9 per cent in the
October-December quarter gives hope to the optimists. But there is a long
way to go.
To start with, the Americans present their statistics in their very own
special way. Although it seems to have been a good quarter, the year-on-year
growth rate was only 2.9 per cent. And with tax increases on the way, the
underlying pace of advance is not really very exciting. Moreover, it has
been achieved with the help of very lax monetary policy, which surely will
have to be tightened soon.
In the UK, there is a fair degree of business optimism, judging by the
latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry which indicated
that prospects in manufacturing were the best in 4 1/2 years. The reported
latest 2 per cent economic growth rate is probably an under-estimate. But
the extraordinary renewed fuss over the tax increases imposed in last year's
two Budgets - to which people have apparently woken up on receiving their
new income tax codings - is a reminder of the fragility of confidence.
Politicians can juggle their spending and taxing policies but, in the end,
they cannot square a circle. Just look at how Japan, the epitome of
successful economic manipulation since the 1960s, has slumped into political
chaos.
The indebtedness generated in the bubble economy of the 1980s continues to
threaten financial collapse and, under the strain of the adjustment, the
country's renowned political and industrial consensus ('Japan Inc') has
fallen apart.
In the end, economics imposes its own solutions. For British investors, this
week's publication of Barclays de Zoete Wedd's hardy annual, the Equity-Gilt
Study, may stimulate some thoughts on the eternal triangular battle between
economic growth, inflation and interest rates.
Since 1918, the real return on UK equities has been 8 per cent a year on
average, beating the long-dated gilt-edged return by 6 percentage points. No
contest: history thus tells us that the outperformance by gilts over the
past four years, by 4 per cent a year, has been just a blip.
But, although history cannot lie, it may speak with a forked tongue. Between
the wars, gilts offered strong real returns. The problems developed later
because of the chronic high inflation (unmatched by bond yields) in the
post-second world war decades up to and including the 1970s. Experience in
the two periods was quite different. So, if the climate of the 1930s was to
return, might gilt-edged investors reap their reward? True, in the 1930s,
equities provided a still higher real return than did gilts.
The key to the inter-war years, however, was deflation - an average annual
fall in prices of 2 per cent. That is surely not going to happen again,
because governments have abandoned the gold peg for their currencies and
have generally established targets for the minimum as well as the maximum
annual growth rate of the money supply. The banking collapses of the early
1930s that led to severe monetary contraction in the US are not going to be
allowed to recur.
Instead, central banks in the advanced economies are pumping out liquidity
on a vast scale. In the past year, the narrowly-defined US money supply has
expanded by more than 10 per cent (although the broader measures, which
include savings deposits, have been depleted by large shifts into mutual
funds and other theoretically long-term assets).
In present conditions, the easy credit strategy is pushing up the prices of
financial assets rather than of goods and services. But the potential is
there for more general inflation and there will not, at any rate, be the
falls in prices (except possibly in Japan) that once persuaded holders of
Consols in the UK that yields of 3 or 4 per cent were acceptable; in the
19th century, prices were as likely to fall as rise.
Will the strategy of bailing out busted banks really achieve its object,
though? No one wants to endure the financial chaos that arises from massive
defaults, but the positive side of such collapses in the past - for
instance, in the US in the early 1930s - was that they destroyed debt and
thus de-geared the national balance sheet, an essential precondition for an
eventual recovery.
Nowadays, the old debt lives on: household borrowing in the UK remains at
very close to record levels (more than 100 per cent of personal disposable
income, twice as high as in the early 1980s). For the moment, a fall in the
saving ratio is fuelling a rise in consumption, but high indebtedness and
slow income growth indicate that those looking for sustained rapid growth in
consumer demand will be disappointed.
If the UK economic growth rate sinks back later this year to, say, 1.5 per
cent, the government will be forced to recognise that only more overtly
inflationary policies - of cutting interest rates, encouraging a decline in
the sterling exchange rate, and tolerating a rapid growth of the money
supply - will restore expansion at a rate fast enough for the Treasury's
tax-gathering projections to be met. The implicit choice of fast inflation
to destroy debt was, of course, the UK's escape route from the mid-1970s'
debt crisis.
The key indicator here is the ratio between the long gilt yield and the
equity yield, now 2.0. Between the wars, according to the BZW study, this
yield ratio was on average 0.8, reflecting not only the absence of inflation
but also poor expectations of economic growth. Since 1945, however, the
average has risen sharply to about 1.7, and the ratio has shown surprisingly
little tendency to decline over the past couple of years.
By implication, although investors have reduced their expectations of the
rate of inflation, they still believe it will persist over the very long
term. And in the US, too, the economic locomotive is absorbing an awful lot
of monetary fuel.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sainsbury shares plunge 48p in biggest one-day fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in J Sainsbury yesterday suffered their biggest ever one-day fall,
plunging 48p to 393p, as the UK's largest supermarket group signalled it was
not immune to fierce competition in the grocery market, writes Neil Buckley.
Sainsbury's disclosed a 1 per cent drop over the past four months in
like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, against the same period last
year, as well as a fall in profit margins. It warned it would achieve only a
'small' increase in profits for the year. It is also making a one-off Pounds
365m property write-down, and starting to depreciate its buildings.
The statement ends a decade of spiralling profits from Sainsbury's which,
along with rivals Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, are being squeezed by
cut-price operators. The Sainsbury fall pulled down other shares in the
sector. Argyll fell 14p to 258p, and Kwik Save 27p to 593p.

FT  29 JAN 94 / BankAmerica buys Continental Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BankAmerica, the US's second biggest bank, is to buy Chicago-based
Continental Bank in a Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.26bn) deal which marks its
first big expansion away from its west coast base.
The deal sent a flurry of anticipation through the stock market, sending the
shares of banks which are considered potential takeover candidates sharply
higher.
Although BankAmerica had been widely seen as a potential buyer, it was not
expected to attempt a big takeover until it had fully digested its 1992
takeover of the troubled Security Pacific. Its emergence could prompt others
to accelerate their own acquisition plans, speeding up the pace of takeovers
in the US banking industry.
BankAmerica will issue 21.25 new shares to Continental shareholders, valued
at midday yesterday at Dollars 975m, and pay Dollars 939m in cash. The cash
and paper offer values each Continental share at around Dollars 35 1/2.
The purchase will cement the San Francisco-based BankAmerica's position as
one of the US's largest corporate banks, and will bring it nearly
shoulder-to-shoulder with Citicorp in terms of overall assets. Based on 1993
figures, the new bank would have assets of Dollars 209bn, compared with
Citicorp's Dollars 216bn.
Continental - formerly Continental Illinois - was the subject of a Dollars
4.5bn bail-out in 1984, at that time the US's largest financial rescue, when
depositors fled the bank over fears about losses on its energy loans.
Since then, it has shed its retail side and concentrated on corporate
banking, becoming the largest corporate bank in the industrial heartland of
the midwest. It had assets of Dollars 22.6bn at the end of last year, and a
return on capital of 15.6 per cent, broadly in line with other big US
commercial banks.
The deal will strengthen the Chicago corporate banking market, already the
second largest in the US after New York.
BankAmerica plans to make the city the headquarters for all its US corporate
banking operations, which had assets of around Dollars 60bn and after-tax
earnings of more than Dollars 500m last year. The shares of BankAmerica fell
Dollars 1 in early trade before partly recovering to close down Dollars 3/8
at Dollars 45 3/8.

FT  29 JAN 94 / BT halts performance pay plan for 26,000 managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT has suspended its performance-related pay scheme for its 26,000 managers
after only 10 months, claiming that they are already paid too much.
BT says its managers receive up to 14 per cent more than the market rate. At
present the income range of its managerial and professional grades is from
Pounds 17,128 a year to Pounds 34,931.
The company has now decided that 10 per cent of its managerial high-flyers
will receive rises of up to 6 per cent this year, although a 'significant'
number of the rest will receive unconsolidated payments worth 2 per cent.
Some will get nothing.
'The majority of our managerial and professional grades enjoy rates of pay
significantly above those of appropriate comparators in the industry,' Mr
Peter Archer, BT's employee relations director, said in a letter to Mr Simon
Petch, general secretary of the Society of Telecom Executives. He added: 'To
ensure that the company has a competitive cost base in the medium to long
term, it is essential that our approach on pay should seek to address this
key issue.'
The union responded angrily. 'The company's approach is inconsistent and
wholly at odds with the philosophy of rewarding people for performance,' Mr
Petch has replied. 'Unless substantially modified it will have a devastating
effect on the morale and commitment of the management staff.' He added that
BT had made a 'fundamental breach of its own performance-related pay
scheme'.
The union disputes the way BT carried out its pay comparisons and says it
has been refused access to the raw data.
BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance was a strong supporter of the
performance-related pay scheme, believing it would stimulate greater
effectiveness.
Britain's biggest company has changed rapidly since privatisation 10 years
ago as it has become more aggressively commercial. The number of its
managers has been cut by 6,000 while management productivity has risen by
82.4 per cent in terms of operating profit since 1986.
BT's managerial pay bill was Pounds 663m last year and brought a 4.8 per
cent rise in its overall costs. This year it hopes to keep the total pay
bill increase down to 2 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Japan's PM averts crisis with diluted reform deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night averted a
crisis which had threatened his survival by watering down his controversial
proposals for political and economic reform.
The deal with the opposition Liberal Democratic party was struck at a last
minute meeting with Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president.
Failure to reach a compromise could have fatally undermined Mr Hosokawa's
five-month-old government and stalled its plans for an economic stimulus to
pull Japan out of recession.
The agreement represents a big concession by the seven-party coalition, but
it keeps the important principle of scrapping Japan's system of multi-seat
electoral districts, blamed for encouraging corruption by pitting candidates
from the same party against one another.
It will go to a parliamentary panel for ratification this morning. Plenary
sittings of the upper and lower chambers will be asked to vote on the
government's original bills later in the day, on the understanding that
amendments will be made in the next session, starting next week. A simple
majority is needed before midnight tonight when the present session expires,
along with unvoted bills.
Success is likely, because the lower house approved Mr Hosokawa's original
reform plans by 270 to 226 last November. Senior politicians on both sides
were yesterday confident of success.
However, the compromise was immediately criticised by anti-reformists in the
LDP, suggesting it will further split the opposition. Mr Yoshinobu
Shimamura, a member of the LDP's conservative Watanabe faction, said Mr Kono
had no right to strike such an accord on the party's behalf and called for
fresh discussions.
A senior member of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition group,
said it accepted the plan. 'It was a hard decision, made with pain, but it
was unavoidable,' said Mr Koken Nosaka, director of the party's Diet
administration committee. Many Socialists have reservations over political
reform, fearing it will further damage their electoral performance.
Mr Hosokawa was forced to negotiate changes with the opposition after his
original plan was voted down in the upper house of parliament last Friday by
the LDP with the help of Socialist defectors.
The compromise would replace the present 511-seat lower house of parliament
with a 500-seat chamber, of which 300 members would come from single-seat
constituencies with the remaining 200 elected by proportional representation
from 11 regions.
Politicians would be allowed, as at present, to receive corporate donations,
but they would only be allowed to employ one fund-raising group, rather than
several, as now.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all the huffing and puffing of the last few weeks, no serious offer has
yet been made for The Independent or the equally ailing Independent on
Sunday. Mr Tony O'Reilly's curious proposal almost seems designed to make
life as difficult as possible, since it asks shareholders - almost half of
whom are hostile - to tender 20 per cent of their shares and accept dilution
on the remainder. On the other hand, the consortium of founder-directors,
Mirror Group, El Pais and La Repubblica have not yet proffered anything as
vulgar as a cheque. This uncertainty can hardly help the wilting
circulation, whatever the merits of free publicity.
Presumably much of the fan-dancing is negotiating tactics, and some nascent
bidders may have an eye to the expiry of Newspaper Publishing banking lines
in March. Yet the delay risks further serious damage to titles, which can
hardly be in shareholders' interest. Matters are not helped by fact that the
board and the bidders appear to be talking at cross purposes. The chairman,
Mr Ian Hay Davison, says he is conducting an auction, while the consortium
says it is trying to start negotiations. As Private Eye would say: 'Get on
with it - Ed.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: MidCap index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Head to head competition among London's futures and options exchanges is the
exception rather than the rule. But the London International Financial
Futures Exchange and OMLX, a competing exchange, are poised to launch rival
futures on the FT-SE Mid 250 index. The timing could hardly be better. The
MidCap has roundly outperformed the FT-SE 100 index since sterling left the
European exchange rate mechanism, rising by 15 per cent in the last two
months alone. While enthusiasm for second line stocks continues, fund
managers will doubtless welcome instruments which help them manage risk.
Less clear is whether there is sufficient demand to support two thriving
contracts. There must be a danger that two relatively illiquid products will
result, in which case fund managers would stand back. That would start a
game of chicken between the exchanges until one or other decided to cut its
losses. The more desirable outcome is that a front runner emerges quickly
and benefits from a virtuous circle in which liquidity generates interest of
its own.
Whichever exchange comes out on top, though, users have the opportunity to
decide. By launching its contract at the end of next week, OMLX will be
first on to the market. Against that, Liffe's established FT-SE 100 future
could give it the edge. The further question is whether interest in second
line stocks is sufficient to support a liquid future right through the
cycle. Experience suggests fund managers will turn their attention back to
the FT-SE 100 index after the economy has turned.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets had been primed for high US growth in the fourth quarter.
The surprise was the weak inflation that accompanied yesterday's data with
an implicit price deflator of only 1.3 per cent. That seems to give markets
the perfect combination of high growth with low inflation. It can only help
equities if there is an even longer interval for corporate earnings to grow
before the Federal Reserve decides to tighten.
The bond market, too, is clearly happy to be reprieved. There seems little
likelihood of such high growth continuing. The Clinton administration was
quick to point to reasons why the fourth quarter was an aberration; crop
losses after last summer's floods were smaller in the fourth quarter than in
the third and car production was abnormally high. It will take some time for
present trends to become clear, though. Blizzards on the east coast and an
earthquake on the west are bound to distort January's data. Higher
investment spending on plant might prompt a downward revision to next
month's capacity utilisation figures. That would sit badly with any monetary
tightening.
Yet the unusual sight of a US administration trying to talk down the growth
rate is an indication of worry about how markets would react to any rise in
short-term rates. While that concern may now go underground for a while, it
is unlikely to disappear altogether and could resurface at any sign, rogue
or otherwise, of economic strength. For bonds, this may yet be one of those
occasions where it is better to arrive than to travel fearfully.

FT  29 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Everyday low prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of the supermarket group, has more reason than
most to be grumpy about the market's reaction to the company's trading
statement. Yesterday's 48p fall in Sainsbury's share price shaved about
Pounds 165m from the value of his shareholding. While the Pounds 365m
property write-off caught the eye, the poor trading figures were perhaps the
more serious blow. Despite the company's repetitive 'essential for the
essentials' marketing campaign, like-for-like sales have fallen. Admittedly,
the company was up against a particularly strong performance in the previous
year. But the notion that Sainsbury's underlying sales could actually be
falling is a profound psychological shock to an already rattled market.
The central question now is whether Sainsbury is right to think that there
has been a one-off drop in margins as a result of renewed competition from
Asda and Gateway and the arrival of discounters. The more frightening, and
perhaps plausible, idea is that the expansion of stores in the last few
years has entrenched a level of competition which will drive margins much
lower. If that happens, the property write-downs which Sainsbury announced
yesterday will not be enough.
Sainsbury's statement also shows that not even the market leader is immune
to competitive pressures. Given the way that these have forced Sainsbury to
make price cuts and slow its opening programme, its claim that the new level
of margins is sustainable looks distinctly suspect. Since Sainsbury only
controls an eighth of a market with static demand and rising supply, market
forces, rather than Sainsbury's management, are likely to dictate margins in
the next few years. On that basis, the company's market yield is not
sufficient defence against the bloodletting ahead.

FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits fresh high on
inflation cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A tame reading on fourth-quarter inflation pushed US stocks further into
uncharted territory yesterday, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.13 ahead at 3,945.43, well
above the short-lived record of 3,926.30 set the previous session. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.65 at 478.70. In secondary
markets, the American SE composite was 1.36 better at 483.22, and the Nasdaq
composite added 3.65 to 796.53.
NYSE activity was heavy, with 314m shares exchanged. Advances led declines,
1,300 to 756.
After a surprising rally in bond prices the previous session, stocks were
poised for their fourth record-breaking Friday in a row. Investors were not
disappointed, as the Dow blue-chip barometer opened more than 25 points
higher after the Commerce Department released its initial estimate for gross
domestic product in the final three months of 1993.
The data were better than expected on two counts. First, the economy
expanded by a robust 5.9 per cent, higher than the consensus forecast of 5.2
per cent but not entirely surprising given recent statements by senior
government officials. The most welcome news concerned inflation, with the
price deflator inching up only 1.3 per cent, well below expectations of 2.5
per cent.
In reaction, the long end of the US Treasury market, which is especially
vulnerable to inflationary pressures, registered fresh gains. By midday, the
benchmark 30-year note was up  21/32 to 100 1/2, and the yield dropped to
6.208 per cent.
The prospect of lower interest rates helped bank issues in general. Bankers
Trust, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 82 1/4, and JP Morgan, Dollars 3/4 ahead
at Dollars 71 1/8, received an extra boost from SG Warburg, which upgraded
the stocks.
But it was Continental Bank that stood out from the rest of the sector. It
jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 34 1/2 after the announcement of its
acquisition by BankAmerica for Dollars 1.9bn in cash and stock. BankAmerica,
which said it would buy back Dollars 500m in its shares before completing
the deal, dipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 45 3/8.
The agreement lifted some regional banks, which are potential takeover
targets. Wells Fargo climbed Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 138 7/8 and First
Interstate Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/2.
The week's stream of corporate earnings news slowed to a trickle yesterday.
One of those reporting was Scientific-Atlanta, a supplier of satellite,
cable television and data transmission equipment. It plunged Dollars 4 to
Dollars 27 5/8 after the company revealed sharply lower net income and
revenues.
US Surgical was Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 31 1/4.

FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Mutual funds the key to Toronto
prospects - Nervousness among the bulls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How long can this go on? That is the question most often raised these days
about the heady performance of the Toronto stock exchange.
The TSE-300 index has broken new records on 10 of the 19 trading days since
New Year. Having risen by 29 per cent in 1993, it has gained another 171
points, or 3.9 per cent, to 4,492.21 so far this month.
The action in recent weeks has centred on some of the economy's late
bloomers, such as resource companies, media groups and real estate
developers. Forestry shares have been boosted by evidence that the long
slide in pulp and paper prices may be over. Abitibi-Price, the newsprint
producer, has bounced up from CDollars 13.25 at the end of October to
CDollars 16.25.
The TSE's real-estate sub-index has climbed by almost 7 per cent in the past
four weeks, thanks to a continuing slide in interest rates and early signs
of renewed demand for space in office blocks and shopping malls. Bank shares
have been another favourite, bolstered by the prospect of declining loan
losses and rising credit demand. Bank of Nova Scotia, investors' current
darling, has jumped from CDollars 29 to CDollars 32 in the past three
months.
Many analysts remain bullish. ScotiaMcLeod recently advised clients to
expand the equity component of their portfolios from 45 per cent to 50 per
cent on the strength of an expected further surge in the TSE-300 to 4,800 by
mid-year.
Much of the optimism stems from the seasonal flood of savings into
tax-sheltered portfolios prior to the Feb 28 contributions deadline. Beyond
that, there is the prospect of a further fall in long-term bond yields
coupled with rising earnings and dividends.
But signs of nervousness are also not hard to find. Institutional investors
acknowledge that they have growing difficulty identifying undervalued
outlets for the cash which is pouring into their coffers. ScotiaMcLeod
cautions that a correction in the TSE-300 to around 4,500 is possible by the
end of the year. Some Canadian equity mutual funds have begun to raise the
cash component of their portfolios. They are motivated partly by the paucity
of attractive investments, but also by concern that a market setback may
lead to a rash of redemptions.
The behaviour of mutual fund managers and investors could be crucial in
determining both the timing and the extent of a correction. As in the US,
mutual funds have become the new musclemen in Canada's financial markets.
Total assets of the funds that do business in Canada, roughly 600, have
soared from CDollars 67bn at the end of 1992 to CDollars 110bn last month.
Mutual funds have been prime movers in the growth of TSE volume from an
average of 13,900 transactions a day in 1992 to 23,700 last year. The funds
have also been among the most eager investors in the flood of new equity
issues. According to the Investment Dealers Association, the value of common
equity issues on Canadian securities markets soared from CDollars 10.9bn to
CDollars 20.8bn in 1993. 'The system is relatively awash with liquidity,'
says Mr Michael Shannon, a portfolio manager at Pembroke Management, a
Montreal-based investment adviser. 'It's only in initial public offerings
and new issues that an institution can get the kind of stock it requires.'
In many cases, a single institution has bought a stake of 10 per cent or
more in a newly-listed company. In their drive to outperform the market,
managers of equity funds have increasingly been drawn to small and
medium-sized companies which have been in the vanguard of the flood of
initial public offerings (IPOs).
The 89 IPOs on the TSE last year ranged from a host of resource and
high-technology companies to A Buck or Two Stores, a retail chain selling
products with a price tag of no more than CDollars 5.
Until now, newly-listed companies have been among the market's stellar
performers. The risk, however, is that these shares could be as volatile
coming down as they were going up.
The extent of the sell-off could depend heavily on whether retail investors
rush to redeem mutual fund units during the course of a sharp market
correction. Mr Selwyn Kossuth, president of the Investment Funds Institute
of Canada, the industry's trade association, notes that net inflows
continued in the immediate aftermath of the October 1987 crash. As Mr
Shannon points out, 'every dip in the market has been an opportunity to buy
as opposed to a warning signal to get out.'
Nevertheless, mutual fund redemptions did pick up sharply in 1988 and 1989.
The outflow from real-estate funds was so heavy in the early 1990s that
several fund managers either slapped a ban on further redemptions or
converted their funds into listed real-estate investment trusts.
Regulators and the industry itself have sought to bolster investor
confidence with quarterly reporting of mutual fund portfolios, and limits on
holdings of obviously illiquid securities. Several mutual fund distributors
have raised their minimum investment in the hope of attracting long-term
investors who will not panic at the first sign of trouble. None of these
precautions offers a watertight assurance, however, that investors and fund
managers will remain calm in stormy waters.

FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rallies in London
on reform deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors remained inactive ahead of Saturday's deadline for political
reform, and share prices gave up further ground on profit-taking by
corporate investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. However, the decline
was reversed in London after hours after the Japanese prime minister, Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa won a face-saving deal.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell 133.91 to 18,757.88, for a week's decline of
nearly 3 per cent, as overseas investors and dealers, who have been the
leading buyers recently, were absent. The Topix index of all first section
stocks lost 8.68 to 1,527.82.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 41.60 higher at 1,306.43. This
reversed the pattern of the previous Friday, when the reform bill's upper
house defeat took Japanese stocks down nearly 3 per cent in London after a
1.8 per cent gain in the domestic market - where the Nikkei followed London,
with a 4.8 per cent drop last Monday.
Ahead of the deal, Japanese domestic institutions said that they were
reluctant to increase their weightings at current levels since the recent
rise did not reflect an improvement in underlying economic fundamentals.
However, Nippon Life, the largest life insurer, said that many investors
were looking to increase exposure at lower levels.
The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 18,869.59 and fell to a low of
18,657.17 in the afternoon. Volume was 250m shares against 431m. Losers led
gainers by 718 to 262 with 178 unchanged.
Electronics stocks were lower on profit-taking. NEC fell Y17 to Y966 and
Sony declined Y20 to Y5,830.
Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30
to Y3,100 and Mitsubishi Bank declined Y50 to Y2,860. Brokers were also
lower with Nomura Securities down Y10 to Y2,070.
Overseas investors bought steel stocks. Nippon Steel, the day's most active
issue, rose Y6 to Y329 and Kawasaki Steel gained Y8 to Y340.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 145.48 to 20,609.16 in volume of 83m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y6,430.
Roundup
The region's markets reacted to domestic issues yesterday.
HONG KONG ended weaker after a day of volatile trading on reports that banks
were trying to dampen down speculation in the property sector by lifting
mortgage rates. The Hang Seng index lost 92.59 to 11,377.83, after an
initial gain of more than 170 points, for a week's fall of 0.7 per cent.
Turnover was some HKDollars 8bn.
The reports forced heavy selling among property stocks and the sub-index
shed 1.8 per cent in value.
KUALA LUMPUR saw institutional buying of selected blue-chips push the
composite index up 15.82 or 1.5 per cent to 1,090.06. However, brokers
remained cautious and forecast further profit-taking next week. The index
has gained 3.4 per cent over the week.
SINGAPORE benefited from the gains in Malaysia, and the Straits Times
Industrials index advanced 13.79 to 2,300.07, a week's rise of 0.8 per cent.
SEOUL rose for the sixth straight session to hit another four-year high. The
composite index added 19.31 to 926.75, up 6.4 per cent this week.
The newly-listed Samsung Heavy was very active, closing limit up at
Won28,000.
TAIWAN fell back after Thursday's 3 per cent gain and the weighted index
slipped 6.31 to 6,016.08, having opened at 6,088.56. Turnover was TDollars
78.3bn and the index has risen 1.2 per cent this week.
Financials, which led Thursday's rebound, fell back.
AUSTRALIA was driven higher by overseas demand and the All Ordinaries index
closed up 9.2 at 2,259.9. The banking sector added 50.2 or 1.6 per cent,
with Westpac rising 15 cents to ADollars 5.29, its highest level since
February 1990.
NEW ZEALAND closed at a 52-month high, fuelled by a rise in Telecom, up 16
cents at NZDollars 4.60, as the NZSE-40 capital index gained 29.86, or 1.3
per cent, to 2,338.28. The index has risen 2.6 per cent on the week.
BANGKOK's SET index broke through the 1,500 level to close the session up
9.26 at 1,507.35. Turnover also improved to Bt19.4bn from Thursday's
Bt16.1bn.

FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US economic data help boost
senior bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses galloped ahead yesterday, some of them giving due credit to
better US economic data, but others advancing reasons of their own, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was gently better on the session and the Dax index closed at
2,133.47, up 8.33 on the day and 2.8 per cent better on the week. Turnover
fell from DM9.5bn to DM8.6bn.
However, the post-bourse was enlivened by comments from the Bundesbank's
chief economist, Mr Otmar Issing - who forecast that M3 growth would
normalise early in 1994, and that inflation would fall below 3 per cent in
the second half of this year - and boosted further by better than expected
US inflation and GDP data.
The Ibis-indicated Dax closed another 23.14 higher at 2,156.61. The German
and US economic news helped interest rate-sensitive, and exporters' stocks
respectively, said Mr Harry Jaarsma at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.
Allianz rose DM52 from the previous Ibis-indicated close to DM2,802, and
Deutsche Bank by DM18.50 to DM825. Among exporters, Volkswagen gained DM6.40
at DM439.40 and Linde DM11 at DM896.
Daimler was one exporter which gained little, up just DM1.50 at DM810 after
the James Capel downgrade in London on Thursday, and on pressure in the US
market yesterday after Deutsche Bank launched another ADR offer in the stock
overnight.
ZURICH posted its fourth consecutive record close, the SMI index adding 45.5
or 1.5 per cent to 3,140.7, for a 3.3 per cent rise on the week.
Early demand came from domestic investors on a forecast that Swiss inflation
will fall below 1 per cent this summer. US investors were also active buyers
late in the day.
Roche certificates rose another SFr140 to SFr7,100, 6.7 per cent better on
the week amid share split speculation, and market rumours that UBS was short
in the stock.
MILAN produced a second consecutive record performance, as foreign buyers
turned their attention to the laggard telecommunications and insurance
sectors. The Comit index rose 5.63 to 641.83, up 4.6 per cent on the week,
in record turnover of L1,138bn.
Montedison continued to climb, rising L70 or 6.4 per cent to L1,159, for a
cumulative 16.7 per cent rise on the week. Volume of 154.7m shares again
prompted speculation about stake building, although Consob, the market
watchdog, said that it had received no notification of such a move. Sip
closed L153 or 4 per cent higher at L3,991 after an apparent trading error
saw it jump almost 10 per cent at one stage, forcing a temporary trading
suspension. Stet rose L85 to L4,524.
MADRID saw feverish buying late in the day and the general index hit a new
high of 352.34, up 3.72, and by 3.1 per cent on the week. Turnover eased to
Pta38.4bn from the previous day's Pta57.5bn.
Interest rate-sensitives moved on the strong domestic bond market, the
utilities, Iberdrola and Fecsa, rising by Pta55 to Pta1,175, and Pta45 to
Pta1,060 respectively.
PARIS was encouraged by a number of factors, including the US data which
came late in the session, as well as technical trading. The CAC-40 index
finished 32.22 ahead at 2,313.17, a week's gain of 3 per cent.
Heavy US buying lay behind the rise among automotive stocks. James Capel in
London recommended Peugeot on Thursday, noting that given the flat
performance of the shares during 1993 'there is more than average scope for
them to rise on recovery prospects.' The carmaker put on FFr28 to FFr855,
while Michelin advanced FFr10 to FFr254.90.
Euro Disney went against the trend, losing FFr1.45 to FFr35.05, following
reports that the company was relying on survival from funds made available
by its US parent, Walt Disney.
AMSTERDAM's AEX index finished with a solid gain of 4.07 to 429.78, a week's
rise of 0.3 per cent. Among the day's best rises was the 4.6 per cent
recorded by Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium group, on a potential
breakthrough in curbing global overproduction of aluminium. The shares
closed up Fl 2.50 to Fl 57.00.
Akzo was one of the few losers, closing off 70 cents at Fl 209, on worries
about the interruption of electricity supplies to its plant in the north of
the country on Thursday. The group said that there would be no impact on
earnings.
STOCKHOLM was heartened by the good US economic data and the Affarsvarlden
General index rose 14.4 to an all-time high of 1,574.6. Volvo B rose SKr29
to a record SKr682.
ISTANBUL pulled back from an early fall of nearly 7 per cent as domestic
investors, who have been behind the market's 30 per cent decline in local
currency terms this week, returned as buyers.
The composite index closed down 4.9 per cent at 18,562. Following the
devaluation of the Turkish lira on Wednesday, overnight interest rates were
raised to 400 per cent as the central bank tried to protect the currency.
Local investors were also encouraged by a statement from the prime minister,
Mrs Tansu Ciller, that she was considering new tax incentives to encourage
equity investment.

FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Water shares respond
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Water shares were among the market's best performers with the shares
responding to renewed hopes of imminent interest rate cuts in the UK, which
would focus market attention on the well above average yields available in
the sector.
There was also an additional boost for the sub-sector as marketmakers were
thought to have been alerted to stories that SG Warburg might be about to
publish a strong buy note on the sector. And the market was alive with hints
that many fund managers were switching out of the consumer sectors, such as
breweries and food retailing where there are threats to dividend growth
prospects, into the strong income areas such as waters and electricity
stocks.
Premium water stocks raced higher on the Warburg push. Anglian added 6 to
572p, North West 16 to 578p, Severn Trent 14 to 610p and Thames 16 to 592p.
Kleinwort Benson was responsible for driving National Power up 10 to 485p,
while the market's big income funds continued to chase Scottish Hydro, which
raced up 16 to 465p and Scottish Power put on 17 1/2 to 474 1/2 p.
Food manufacturers were under pressure from the Sainsbury news as investors
fretted over the impact on suppliers of tighter retailing margins. Among
those hit, Unigate fell 16 1/2 to 392 1/2 p, United Biscuits 9 to 369p and
Northern Foods 15 to 232p.
Calls to reassure city analysts helped TI Group recover from a sharp fall
early in the session. The retreat followed reports in the French press of
problems in the landing gear in one Airbus 330 operated by Air Inter, that
led to the suspension of flights using the aircraft. At the day's worst the
shares were down 20 at 395p, but recovered to close 7 off at 408p, on volume
of 1.9m.
Market watchers were cheered by encouraging news on the new Rolls-Royce
Trent 800 jet engine. The shares firmed a penny to 183 1/2 p, on volume of
5m.
Shares in Smiths Industries gave up 12 to 474p, after James Capel trimmed
its profits estimate for the year to July 1995. A large line of stock was
also said to be overhanging the shares.
A spate of downgradings following a series of city presentations on Thursday
brought a sharp fall for international trading group Inchcape. The shares
surrendered 20 to 586p, as BZW and Nomura reduced current profits
expectations.
Courtaulds Textiles moved ahead 19 to 555p after announcing that it had
bought most of the stockings and tights business of Hartstone, the leather
and consumer goods group for Pounds 45.4m. Hartstone shares closed 2 lower
at 68p.

Stronger than expected fourth-quarter GDP figures from the US undermined

FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury slumps on statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A shock trading statement from J. Sainsbury sent the shares tumbling to
their biggest ever one-day fall as turnover hit a record 24m. In a sector
getting used to depressing news, the Sainsbury announcement of lower
margins, slack sales and property write-downs still came as a huge blow and
flew in the face of what the market had been widely anticipating.
'It's an unmitigated disaster,' said Mr Frank Davidson at James Capel.
'These figures show Sainsbury is performing worse than the competition and
raises the question: is it worth its premium rating?' The answer from
investors seemed to be 'no'as the shares came under immediate pressure,
tumbling 30 as the market opened and finally closing at 393p, a drop of 48
on the day. And with Sainsbury giving what amounted to a profits warning,
analysts slashed their forecasts, by around 15 per cent to about Pounds
700m.
The announcement shook food retail analysts, many of whom had only recently
begun to relax their negative stance on the sector. Yesterday, Sainsbury's
more recent supporters were hard to find. But one, who preferred to remain
anonymous, argued that the announcement showed margin pressure was easing.
However, the market focused on the perception of dramatically lower earnings
growth and slower dividend gains. In turn, many switched their attention to
Sainsbury's competitors. Capel's calculates that on 1995 forecast, Sainsbury
yields 3.5 per cent, Tesco 4.7 per cent and Argyll 5.8 per cent. Tesco
shares rallied to close just a half-penny off at 222 1/2 p in turnover of
18m. Argyll fell 14 to 258p.

FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close as base rate optimism
reappears - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news on inflation in the US brought a dramatic turnaround in the UK
securities markets yesterday, with the stock market replacing an early loss
of 24 points on the FT-SE scale with a gain of similar proportions as the
two week trading account closed. Government bonds gained more than half a
point, the shorter dates edging higher as interest rate optimism revived.
But there was little recovery for shares in Sainsbury, Britain's
premium-rated food retailer, which fell by more than 10 per cent in the
heaviest turnover for two years following a trading statement from the
boardroom.
Food retailing and manufacturing stocks were hit by Sainsbury's statement,
which also deepened the market's doubts over the progress of the recovery in
the UK. The Footsie dipped to the 3,403 area, but dealers were relieved to
see this potentially testing level hold secure. Securities markets made
little response to news of Britain's non-EU trade deficit of Pounds 675m in
December. Although this was above expectations, the market remained
uninterested in the trade deficit.
There was no genuine rally in London until the announcement that US Gross
Domestic Product had risen by an annualised 5.9 per cent in the 1993 fourth
quarter, while the fixed weight price deflator had gained only 1.3 per cent
 -barely half the gain feared by some analysts.
Markets interpreted this as a sign that, with the US economy expanding
strongly while inflation remains subdued, the Federal Reserve was now less
likely to raise US interest rates. UK gilts followed sharp gains in Federal
bonds, and share prices quickly turned higher as increased volume levels
showed themselves on the trading screens in the City's dealing rooms.
At the close, the FT-SE Index stood at 3,447.4, a net gain on the day of
20.1 points. The recovery was spurred by further buying as the stock market
moved into its new trading account. Over the two week account, the Footsie
has risen by around 1.4 per cent, but gains were sharply cut back this week,
when the Index lost 36.8 as some gloomy reports from the retailing sector
undermined the confidence shown over Christmas.
Yesterday's abrupt recovery was slow to spread across the full range of the
market, however. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, still plagued by fears that more
expiries of individually structured options contracts are pending, closed
down 10.6 at 4,065.8.
Renewed optimism for an early cut in UK base rates brought strong rises in
bank shares and helped some of the retail stocks which had suffered earlier
in the week. Building stocks turned higher as attention focused on next
week's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council.
But the implications of Sainsbury's statement lay heavily across the brewery
and food-related sectors, where nervousness over profit margins has been
unsettling investors for some months.
Trading volume increased as the market recovered, and number of shares
traded through the Seaq electronic network reached 1.14bn. On Thursday,
972.5m shares traded through Seaq for a retail worth of Pounds 2bn, well
above the daily average for the past year. Traders admitted that the
consumer sectors were likely to remain overshadowed by this week's mixed set
of trading results from leading companies but believed that confidence had
improved across the wider range of the stock market.

FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squeeze brought a sharp advance in Footsie futures on the last day of the
equity account, writes Joel Kibazo.
Dealers attributed the early weakness in the March contract on the FT-SE 100
to 'squaring of the books' and the contract fell to its low of 3,413 within
the first hour of trading.
A slow and tentative rally soon prised the big institutions from the
sidelines and that demand turned into a squeeze sending March further ahead.
The release of favourable figures on US inflation not only brought another
bout of hectic demand but also helped bring a turnaround in the fortunes of
the underlying cash market. At the day's peak the contract showed a premium
of 20 points to cash.
It finished at 3,466, around 11 points ahead of its fair value premium to
cash of about 7 points with volume at 16,304.
Volume in the traded options improved to 54,074 of which 16,918 was dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar came under pressure yesterday as concern about US-Japan trade
talks and the likely deferral of a US rate increase combined to push the
currency lower, writes Philip Gawith.
The release of better than expected 4th quarter US GDP figures was offset by
a very low inflation number which caused the market to revise its view of
when the US Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy.
Earlier, the US currency fell following comments by US commerce secretary Mr
Ron Brown that the US would explore options if trade talks with Japan were
inconclusive.
The dollar ended in London at Y109.120, down from Y109.145 on Thursday and
more than three yen down on the week. Preliminary figures released yesterday
showed that the US GDP had grown by 5.9 per cent in the 4th quarter of 1993,
the best figure in six years. Although the figures revealed very good
economic growth in US, they did not help the dollar because of the
exceptionally low deflator figure - regarded as a very reliable measure of
broad inflation - of 1.3 per cent compared to expectations of about 2.5 per
cent.
'This put back expectations of when the Fed will tighten policy, probably to
April rather than February,' said Mr Tony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at
ABN-AMRO Bank in London.
Reports of the large scale selling of the dollar for yen by Japanese
corporates also pushed the US currency lower.
Muddying the waters was a report that the next edition of Business Week
magazine says a number of Fed governors favour tightening policy at next
week's meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
However, 'the market does not feel on balance at the moment that a Fed
tightening is imminent,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ
International in London. The weaker dollar helped the D-Mark which closed
stronger in London at DM1.7273 compared to DM1.7441 on Thursday. The
currency was bolstered by positive comments about the German economy from
Bundesbank board member Mr Otmar Issing, at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland. Mr Issing repeated his view that he expected German
inflation to fall below 3 per cent this year, and also downplayed fears
about high M3 money supply growth, implying that this was an aberration.
High money supply growth and the weakness of the D-Mark had been seen as the
main obstacles to an easing of monetary policy. Mr Issing's comments were
welcomed in the market as 'constructive and helpful'.
Mr Hannah said the markets interpreted Mr Issing's comments as indicating
that the Bundesbank saw no permanent obstacles to a policy easing and that
it was simply a matter of time.
The pound ended stronger against the weak dollar, ending in London at
Dollars 1.5036 compared to Thursday's close of Dollars 1.4925. It was lower,
however, against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5971 from DM2.6031 on
Thursday. Dealers said it was responding more to other events than moving
under its own momentum.
The Bank of England provided the money market with early assistance through
a repo operation totalling Pounds 1.95bn at an interest rate of 5 13/32 per
cent after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 2.3bn. It later
provided a total of Pounds 800m at 5 3/8 per cent after revising the
shortage to Pounds 2.75bn.
On the futures market the short sterling contract for June rose by 6 points
to 94.93.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Agreement hopes lift
aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium prices climbed to 6 1/2 -month highs at the London Metal Exchange
this week as scepticism about producing countries' plans for co-ordinated
output cuts began to be overcome.
Gains were trimmed somewhat yesterday but the three months delivery position
still ended Dollars 48 up on the week at Dollars 1,237.50 a tonne.
Delegates from Russia and leading western producers of the metal met last
week to seek a formula for reducing the current world supply glut, which
most analysts blame on the flood of Russian material to the west that has
ensued from the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The failure of the meeting, which was conducted in extreme secrecy, to
result in a clear statement of intent disappointed the market initially.
However, as it became clear that this resulted from the need to avoid
contravention of anti-trust laws in the US and elsewhere market confidence
in the plan appeared to revive.
A memorandum of understanding based on last week's discussions was
dispatched to participants on Monday. They were asked to respond by 11pm GMT
last night and a statement the European Commission, which hosted the
meeting, is expected soon.
Some traders suggested, however, that this was unlikely to be such as to
drive prices much higher as cuts amounting to 1.5m to 2m tonnes a year
(about 10 per cent of world output) were already factored into current
prices. But if the agreed cuts fell short of that level there was scope for
a sharp market setback.
Sentiment was also dented yesterday by a Russian aluminium industry
official's warning that output cuts resulting from the 'understanding' would
not necessarily results in reduced exports from Russia.
The aluminium market's buoyant mood spilled over into the LME copper
contract, where the three months position gained Dollars 6.25 on the week to
Dollars 1,871.50 a tonne, despite falling Dollars 12 yesterday.
The gold market tested the limits of its recent trading range this week
before ending at the lower end.
A sharp fall on Monday took the London price to Dollars 378.40 a troy ounce,
down Dollars 6.85 from the previous Friday, before support was found. A
modest but sustained recovery lifted it to Dollars 384.80 an ounce on
Thursday morning, before the rot set in again, encouraged by rumours that
Venezuela's troubled Banco Latino might have ten to 15 tonnes of the metal
to sell. The renewed slide continued yesterday, when the price closed at
Dollars 378.40 an ounce, down Dollars 3.80 on the day and Dollars 6.85 on
the week.
The bulls remained undaunted, however, and dealers told the Reuter news
agency that the overall uptrend was still intact. 'It has to go below
Dollars 374 before that is broken,' one said, adding that gold's problem was
its apparent inability to break through upside resistance.
At the London Commodity Exchange a rally encouraged by news that Central
American producers had set a minimum export price of 80 cents a pound, fob,
pushed March coffee futures to Dollars 1,204 a tonne at one stage. But
profit-taking soon had the price back into the Dollars 1,180s and it ended
the week down Dollars 5 at Dollars 1,175 a tonne.
May cocoa futures ended just Pounds 5 higher at Pounds 915 a tonne, after
another abortive attempt in mid-week to break down overhead resistance
around Pounds 920 a tonne.

FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: SAS may sell leisure unit to
Thomson Travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is discussing the sale of its SAS Leisure
unit to Thomson Travel of the UK in a move which would combine two of
Europe's leading tour operators.
Disposal of the unit would be in line with SAS's new focus on core flying
operations and would bolster Thomson's strong position in the European
travel market.
SAS Leisure is Scandinavia's leading tour operator through its Ving and
Always units and it has a market presence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
Ving claims to be Europe's fourth or fifth biggest tour group.
Other operations within SAS Leisure include a 50 per cent stake in Premiair,
the charter airline, and a 49 per cent stake in Spanair. It owns 14 resort
hotels, mainly around the Mediterranean Sea.
SAS declined to indicate how the talks were progressing. 'We have no comment
to make while talks are ongoing,' the company said. Mr Mike Frith, finance
director of Thomson Travel, said it was company policy to make no comment.
Thomson Travel - part of the Canadian Thomson Group - includes Britannia
Airways and Lunn Poly. It is understood there have been other expressions of
interest in the leisure unit which is expected to have incurred its first
loss in 1993.
Last year's performance was affected by recession and the weakening of the
Swedish krona.
At the nine-month stage, SAS Leisure had plunged to a SKr89m (Dollars 10.2m)
loss on revenues of SKr3.43bn. This compares with a SKr64m profit on
revenues of SKr6.4bn for the whole of 1992.
SAS said it intended to focus on core business last November when it
unveiled a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss for the first nine months and a new round
of cost-cutting.
The back-to-basics strategy was reiterated by the group's chief executive
elect, Mr Jan Stenberg, earlier this week.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cupid losses rise to Pounds 0.46m as sales
fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Cupid increased from Pounds 168,000 to Pounds 456,000 in
the six months to September 30, as a shortfall in sales negated efforts to
cut costs.
The USM-traded company has interests in bridal and formal wear and nursery
care products.
Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, said that since the launch of the new collections
in the autumn of last year, retail sales were substantially ahead but second
half sales to date would still be below expectations.
Stronger sales added to cost savings should produce an improved result for
the year, he added. 'But this will be substantially below market
expectations and it is not clear whether the company will return to
profitability in the 12 months to March 31 1994.'
The shares lost 4p yesterday to close at 26p.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 7.28m (Pounds 8.5m). Retail sales reflected the
poor reception to the 1993 Pronuptia collection which was being sold at low
margins in September to reduce stocks.
Losses per share were 1.7p (1.1p).

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Deficit widens at Cathay Intl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cathay International, the China investment vehicle formed from the shell of
Stonehill Holdings, announced pre-tax losses widened to Pounds 515,000 for
the six months to September 30, against Pounds 170,000, but said it was on
target in building up its asset base in China.
Turnover rose marginally to Pounds 1.17m, but operating profit fell as a
result of an increase in activities in China which have yet to make a
contribution.
The company is currently renovating the Fuyuan Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen,
which will reopen in the first quarter of 1994. In addition, Cathay is
proceeding with the redevelopment of a 500,000 sq m site in central Beijing
and upgrading the adjoining Beijing Xiyuan hotel.
Phase one of the project should commence during 1994, and final completion
is due in 1999. The project is 60 per cent owned by Cathay.
At the interim stage, however, the company's main income source was the
Stonehill Business Park in north London.
Mr James Buchanan, chairman, said: 'The results for the year to March 31
1994 will cover a period of significant transition from which the trend in
respect of the importance of the activities in China should be clear.'
The company is currently evaluating further projects in China. Its Hong
Kong-based parent company, which owns 59 per cent of Cathay's shares, is
involved in a number of investments in China. It has focused primarily on
property and power projects.
Losses per share were 0.086p (0.91p). Cathay has been unable to pay a
dividend, due to the absence of distributable reserves.
Following High Court approval to reduce its share capital by Pounds 3.8m,
directors said the deficit on the profit and loss account had been
eliminated and dividends would be resumed 'when appropriate'.

capital outlay

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bridgestone, Asia's largest tyre manufacturer, is to halve its domestic
capital expenditure because of poor demand in Japan.
The company intends to spend Y22bn (Dollars 203m) during 1994, compared with
Y44bn last year and a peak of Y65bn in 1992. Capital investment is unlikely
to increase much above Y22bn over the next three years.
Bridgestone is suffering from the sharpest fall in Japanese vehicle
production for 19 years. Output of vehicles last year fell 10.2 per cent to
11.2m. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association projects it will fall
below 11m vehicles this year.
Bridgestone refused to identify which projects it would cut. It said
spending would be on productivity improvements and savings rather than
capacity expansion.
However, it stressed its overseas investment programme would continue. The
group is building a second plant in Thailand, due for completion in 1996,
and expanding plants in Warren, Nashville, Brazil and Indonesia.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fokus Bank, Norway's fourth largest bank, is pulling out of merger talks
with Christiania Bank, the second-largest banking group, following political
support for it remaining independent.
The two state-controlled banks announced on Monday they were discussing a
merger that would have been one of the biggest rationalisations of the
Norwegian banking system since it was engulfed by a loan-loss crisis at the
turn of the decade. But the announcement was followed by a meeting of
parliament's all-party finance committee at which it became clear there was
majority support for Fokus Bank remaining self-standing by raising funds
through a reprivatisation process.
'We now have clear political backing to pursue an independent solution -
there is definitely a majority in parliament for that,' said Mr Leif Klevan,
chief executive of Fokus.
'We will prepare a new plan for the government on how to proceed, probably
by raising money from the markets.' Fokus, taken over by the state in 1991,
seems to have outflanked the Labour party government, which appeared to
favour a merger with Christiania but which is in a minority in the Storting
(parliament).
The bank was lifted by reports that a group of private foreign and domestic
investors was ready to step in with a NKr500m (Dollars 68.5m)
recapitalisation package. Banking sources said yesterday this proposal was
serious.
The government, which controls all the main banks, has been considering
restructuring the banking system for more than a year. It commissioned a
review from Davis International Banking Consultants of the UK which is
understood to have included a Christiania-Fokus merger as one of the
possible options. But no concrete steps have been taken since Den norske
Creditbank and Bergen Bank were merged to form Den Norske Bank in 1990.
Meanwhile, the first steps towards reprivatisation have been taken through a
share issue last month by Christiania Bank, which left it 69 per cent owned
by the government, and a similar move planned by DnB, the country's largest
bank, in the spring.
The breakdown of the merger talks is a disappointment for Christiania which
hoped to strengthen its geographical spread by what would have been in
effect a takeover of Fokus, which is based in the western city of Trondheim.
Both Christiania, with assets of NKr114bn, and Fokus, with assets of
NKr30bn, reported a return to profit in the first nine months of last year.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Proteus looks to joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proteus International, the computerised drug design company, yesterday
hailed joint ventures as the key to profitability after three successive
years of losses.
Although pre-tax losses more than doubled to Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.21m) in
the six months to September 30, the Macclesfield-based group said such
ventures would give it 'ultimate access to profits'.
Since March last year the USM-traded company, ultimately controlled by
Imseco Medical Services and which specialises in molecular modelling for
drug development, has formed five new joint ventures to produce and market
drugs for the human and animal health sectors.
Most recently, it joined forces with Medeva, the pharmaceuticals group, to
set up Beavermade - a new company to develop synthetic vaccines and
therapeutics for humans.
Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said the group's long term prospects
had been further enhanced by its strategic alliance with American Home
Products, the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical group.
The multi-product agreement with AHP, from which Proteus will receive 50 per
cent profits and retain patents over drugs in clinical development, was
typical of the deals it is pursuing, he said.
'The agreement also gives us the opportunity for substantial future
potential earnings whilst limiting downside risk,' he added.
In spite of his optimism, the shares fell 19p yesterday to close at 423p.
Losses per share rose from 4.73p to 10.08p.
Mr Gilmore, said, however, that the results were broadly in line with
expectations and represented only a small increase over a pre-tax deficit of
Pounds 2.34m in the second half of last year.
Most of the losses were incurred as the company increased product
development.

FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: Outsiders invited into Italy's
boardrooms - Iri, the state holding company, is testing a new mould for
selection of executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of outsiders to fill top jobs at Alitalia, Italy's troubled
national airline, has reinforced the sense that a tough new broom is
sweeping the corridors of state industry.
Mr Renato Riverso, chairman designate, and Mr Roberto Schisano, managing
director, fit the new mould for selecting executives being tested by the big
Iri state holding company, which owns Alitalia and a basket of other
loss-making companies.
Neither man has created quite the stir that followed the selection of Mr
Hayao Nakamura, a senior Nippon Steel executive, to head Iri's chronically
loss-making Ilva steel subsidiary, which is now in liquidation.
The Alitalia appointees are slightly less egregious in that both are
Italians, even if they have been out of the country for much of their
careers.
Mr Riverso, the respected former chairman of IBM's European operations, has
spent 37 years working for IBM since joining it from university.
Mr Schisano, 50, is chairman of the European operations of Texas
Instruments, the US computers and electronic components group, and has
worked much of his life outside Italy.
Iri's growing predeliction for outsiders was indicated last year, with the
choice of Mr Claudio Dematte, a respected business professor, as chairman of
the Rai state broadcasting organisation, which it controls, and of Mr Gianni
Locatelli, editor of the Sole 24 Ore business newspaper, as Rai's managing
director.
Although the Ilva, Rai and Alitalia appointments were made by two different
heads of Iri, they reflect similar priorities for the group as it struggles
to staunch the flow of large losses.
Mr Nakamura was the choice of Mr Michele Tedeschi, Iri's former director
general, who was given full executive powers after the group's July 1992
transformation into a joint stock company.
Although Mr Tedeschi was subsequently shifted to Iri's big Stet
telecommunications arm, Mr Romano Prodi, the new Iri chairman, has been even
more active in privatising successful operations and restructuring
loss-makers as a preliminary to sale or closure. The list of disposals under
Mr Prodi, a market-orientated professor who ran Iri in the 1980s, includes
Credito Italiano, the bank, and the food production arm of the Sme concern.
Next month will see the sale of Iri's controlling stake in Banca Commerciale
Italiana, another big bank. For less healthy operations, the new treatment
has begun with the imposition of new management.
Ilva's expansionist-minded former chief executive, Mr Giovanni Gambardella,
had to make way for Mr Nakamura; various top executives at Iri's heavily
loss-making Iritecna construction arm have been removed; while this week it
has been Alitalia's turn.
Almost all the appointees reflect similar job requirements, spotlighting
previous lacunae in state industry. The most striking has been the stress on
international experience - ideally in the private sector.
That reflects the need to address the increasing globalisation of many of
the businesses in which Iri operates and the consequent need for executives
with the right backgrounds.
It shows an awareness that international alliances will become more
important in many Iri companies. One of the criticisms of Mr Giovanni
Bisignani, Alitalia's former managing director, is that he failed to react
to the merger wave sweeping across the airline industry.
Private-sector experience is as important. Mr Bisignani's career was
exclusively within Iri and Eni, the other big Italian state holding company.
With privatisation essential to shore up Iri's tottering finances, finding
market-orientated executives who have not been nurtured in Italy's big state
monopolies has become a must.
Politics plays a part. Managers inured in the habits of the big state
holding companies have grown accustomed to a world in which large
investments were often based on political, rather than commercial, concerns,
or where rationalisation was regularly postponed for fear of its electoral
consequences.
Political changes have affected Iri directly. The long-running corruption
scandals have led to the resignations of some senior staff, such as Mr
Franco Nobili, the former chairman.
Even where there is no hint of scandal, once prized political contacts can
become embarrassing today. Critics claim Mr Bisignani's fast-track career in
state industry owed something to the sponsorship of Mr Giulio Andreotti, the
veteran political leader.
With managers too closely associated with the discredited political
establishment looking increasingly fragile, observers are asking how long
some senior political appointees can last. Mr Biagio Agnes, the chairman of
Stet, and Mr Ernesto Pascale, who chairs Iri's Sip telecoms utility, look
vulnerable.
However, with a limited supply of suitable candidates with strong
international backgrounds to call upon, the problem for Mr Prodi may be in
finding replacements.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft,
has launched a hostile takeover bid for a small Vancouver-based company
whose main asset is a rich gold and copper deposit in Argentina.
Metall, which is based in Toronto, has offered to buy all the outstanding
common shares of International Musto Explorations for CDollars 232m (Dollars
178.5m), or CDollars 16.25 per share payable in cash or Metall convertible
preferred shares.
Metall has a strong balance sheet, including about CDollars 250m in cash.
Metallgesellschaft is expected to sell its 50.1 per cent stake in the
Canadian company as part of the financial restructuring which has followed
its near collapse. The disposal is dependent on the agreement of Metall's
partners in various joint ventures, as well as securities firms which
underwrote a recent Metall share issue.
The offer is conditional on Musto not disposing of a large part of its 100
per cent stake in the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit in north-west Argentina.
The property is estimated to contain 5.8bn lbs of copper and 10m ounces of
gold. Metall said that at least 50.1 per cent of Musto shares must be
tendered for its bid to go ahead.
Metall made an identical offer to Musto last week, but was turned down by
its management in favour of a joint venture proposal from another
unidentified company. Musto has been seeking a partner to help finance and
develop a mine on the Alumbrera property at an estimated cost of CDollars
550m.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hardy optimist banks on obscure fortunes of
jute - The worldwide development plans of Titaghur in India and Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jute has been a sunset industry for 100 years, according to one industry
observer. But the chairman of the only UK company still operating mills in
India is confident that he can buck the trend.
While observers generally dismiss most ideas for new markets for jute as pie
in the sky, Mr Reg Brealey, chairman of Titaghur, says that the material,
best known for its use as sacking and carpet backing, has a bright future as
an environmentally friendly material.
On Monday he will outline his plans to shareholders in London at the 110th
annual meeting of the company, which has its origins in Dundee, once known
as Jute City.
He has other ideas for taking Titaghur forward, including a scheme to train
disadvantaged youngsters at a newly acquired remote estate in the Scottish
highlands and at his Calcutta jute mills. He also plans to build the biggest
stock of jute goods in the world in Scotland.
But current needs, let alone these plans, urgently require fresh capital.
The company is trying to sell Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) of bonds and get a US
stock listing following its drumming out of the London Stock Exchange four
years ago.
Controversy and bold schemes are not new to Mr Brealey, who is also chairman
of Sheffield United football club.
After his arrival at Titaghur in 1988 the shares soared spectacularly,
becoming share of the year that year and peaking at Pounds 16.88 in 1989.
However, the following year the Stock Exchange cancelled the quote on the
grounds that the company's heavily qualified accounts meant there was
inadequate financial information.
Mr Brealey also became the first person in the UK to face charges of insider
dealing. At the trial the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence on
the charges, which related to Titaghur shares. The judge ordered the CPS to
pay defence costs estimated at Pounds 500,000, and described the 'catalogue
of omissions' in the case as 'so appalling as almost to be considered
scandalous'.
The following year the Court of Appeal rejected a shareholder's attempt to
refer the Exchange's delisting procedure to the European Court of Justice.
Meanwhile, Mr Brealey, whose 29.9 per cent stake in the company cost Pounds
2.5m, had little option but to work through its numerous problems.
The turbulence of the jute industry is reflected in the company accounts,
which now show an accumulated deficit of Pounds 61m after a loss on ordinary
activities of Pounds 4.3m in the year to end-March 1993, the latest figures
available. The shares have been trading recently on a matched bargain basis
at 25p.
In his statement in the 1992-93 annual report, Mr Brealey blames the latest
loss on shortage of raw materials, which led to labour unrest and temporary
closure of two of the company's six mills. In the past 12 months Mr Brealey
has made three visits to Calcutta and now claims to be well on the way to
solving the labour problems.
For the first time a team of 10 UK managers is in place in Calcutta. The
workforce has already been reduced from 18,000 to 16,000. More importantly,
according to Mr Brealey, the company has an agreement with its unions to
reduce the number of workers employed for the manufacture of each tonne of
jute. Further reforms of shift systems are expected.
Full production at the mills would yield 2,500 tonnes a week of finished
jute product. At that level Brealey's mills would have 10 per cent of Indian
jute goods production.
However, the mills are by no means running smoothly. The Victoria has been
closed for the past six weeks while the new managers continue union
negotiations. None of the others are working at full capacity, partly
reflecting the continuing shortage of raw jute.
There are 61 jute mills in Calcutta. While a large number have changed hands
recently, it is impossible to uncover what price they have fetched. Many are
closed at any one time, and some produce only 15 to 20 tonnes a week.
The industry remains troubled, with the mills this week making desperate
attempts to organise imports of raw jute from any possible source. Raw jute
prices have almost doubled since last September, with standard grade jute
now at Dollars 325 a tonne.
Titaghur needs cash badly. Mr Brealey will not reveal with whom he is
holding negotiations over the Dollars 50m bond, but claims that a successful
conclusion would transform the company's balance sheet, giving shareholders'
funds of Pounds 74m, compared with Pounds 58m at March 31 last year.
The group's main assets are the jute mills in Calcutta, operating with
Victorian machinery. The notes to the accounts show the land, buildings and
plant at Pounds 76.4m, as valued by the Indian government authorities.
Part of the bond, which would be secured on properties and stock, would be
used to buy raw jute, and part to finance a 25,000-tonne stock of finished
product in Scotland.
Mr Brealey believes that if he can bring finished product to the UK for sale
into Europe he will realise enhanced profits. He is planning to hold the
stock in new warehouse facilities so that carpet makers can forward buy and
fix their costs. To put this in perspective, the Food and Agricultural
Organisation of the United Nations put 1992 UK imports of jute goods at
38,500 tonnes, while EU imports were 277,300 tonnes.
'Jute has to be the backbone of the company because that's what it is,' says
Mr Brealey. But he has further plans for the group, and has made two
important acquisitions since March last year.
The most controversial has been the purchase of the 16,500-acre estate on
Knoydart Peninsula, one of the most remote parts of Scotland. About Pounds
2.5m has been invested so far in a project to train young people who have
been in care. It will be run by a retired army colonel and has been
described as National Service for civilians.
A sojourn at the jute mills in Calcutta will be an integral and
character-building part of the course. 'Youngsters will see how people earn
their living and change their attitudes,' he says.
The purchase of the estate is also aimed at establishing assets in Britain.
To this end he has also purchased, through the issue of 2m shares, West
Midland Surfacing, a road surfacing group with an annual turnover of about
Pounds 6m.
The group is also moving into the bio-technology market, although details
have yet to emerge. Mr Brealey promises some eye-opening presentations at
the annual meeting of biotechnological projects, at least one of which will
use jute products.
Mr Brealey, who says he has drawn only expenses from Titaghur since 1988,
describes the task of sorting out the company as Herculean. But he points
out that he holds 29.9 per cent of the stock. 'It's in my interests to look
after it.'
However, it has been difficult to make good profits in the Calcutta jute
industry for the past 20 years. Of all the mills in India, totalling about
70, only 12 are now thought to be making reasonable returns.
As one industry observer said: 'It would need a very clever man to go from
Europe and make money from jute.'

purchasing body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault and Volvo have agreed to dismantle their joint purchasing and
quality control organisations in the wake of the collapse of their merger
plans, Renault said yesterday.
The decision was taken during the past week following discussions with
Volvo's new board. It represents one of the most important steps taken by
the companies in determining the future of their relationship since the
merger agreement collapsed last December in the face of strong opposition
from Volvo shareholders.
The two bodies, and in particular the joint purchasing organisation, were
designed to achieve substantial cost-savings and were central elements of
the merger project. Renault said the strategic importance of the purchasing
and quality control operations meant they could not be continued without a
full merger.
Following the failure of the merger, Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman,
said co-operation between the two groups could continue, but certain
sensitive and strategic activities would need to be reviewed.
The companies have suspended work on the P4 project, which was aimed at
developing a common platform to replace the Volvo 900 series and the Renault
Safrane. Other areas of co-operation, including joint distribution
agreements are under review.
Co-operation continues in several important areas. Renault will, for
example, receive Volvo engines for its Laguna model, due to be introduced
shortly, and will supply the Swedish group with engines and gearboxes for
its 400 series.
The cross-shareholdings between the two groups, which include a 20 per cent
holding in Renault SA by AB Volvo and holdings of 25 per cent in Volvo Car
and 45 per cent in Volvo Truck by the French group, remain in place. But a
decision on whether to maintain the joint investments must be made before
Renault's privatisation, which is scheduled for later this year.
The purchasing body was established in January last year.
The aim was to increase joint procurement from 20 per cent of the estimated
FFr85bn (Dollars 14.4bn) of combined total purchases to 80 per cent. The
organisation, like the quality control unit, was based jointly in Paris and
Gothenburg.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone hosiery sale to Courtaulds
Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone yesterday clinched the first step towards securing its future by
selling a large part of its hosiery division to Courtaulds Textiles in a
Pounds 45.4m deal and announcing plans for a rights issue later this year.
It is understood that the company, which breached banking covenants last
summer and has since had several narrow escapes from receivership, is also
close to agreement on medium term financing.
It is thought this will cover the group's needs for between two to three
years. However, any refinancing will depend on an equity issue, which is
expected to raise roughly Pounds 25m.
An announcement is expected before the extraordinary meeting on February 14,
the day before the standstill agreement is due to expire.
Hartstone is selling Cogetex of France, which it bought for Pounds 41m in
1991, and the lossmaking UK hosiery business based in Sutton-in-Ashfield
which includes Bear brand. The two businesses had total sales last year of
Pounds 102m and take Courtaulds Textiles for the first time into the
European hosiery market.
The deal will eliminate off-balance sheet debt of about Pounds 20m and leave
Hartstone's gearing at 118 per cent (200 per cent).
It leaves Hartstone with Aznar, the Spanish company also purchased in 1991,
some UK hosiery interests and a large leather goods business, mainly US
based.
Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, said the group could only afford to focus on one
of the two main divisions if it was to survive.
The hosiery division had suffered extensively from recession in continental
Europe, which had delayed benefits from rationalisation.
However, the leather goods business, which includes the well-known Etienne
Aigner brand name, required 'half the manpower, half the assets and has
twice the profits,' Mr Dowling said. Last year leather goods returned
trading profits of Pounds 12.4m, a decline of 34 per cent.
The remaining hosiery businesses, with sales last year of Pounds 86m, will
be retained for the time being. Courtaulds Textiles has agreed to retain
Aznar as a supplier to Cogetex. Hartstone is expected to review the future
of Aznar and the UK hosiery businesses in about two years.
Mr Noel Jarvis, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said the businesses
acquired had 'considerable potential despite the present tough trading
conditions'. They were expected to contribute trading profits for the year
to March 1994 of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m. They were also likely to
result in a small increase in earnings.
Courtaulds Textiles is paying Pounds 37.4m cash upon completion, a further
Pounds 3.5m upon agreement of a completion statement and the balance in
stages over a four-year period. It said the purchase price represented a
premium over net assets of Pounds 8.7m.

Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurance company which has
for some time hoped to expand into the UK non-life insurance market,
yesterday confirmed that it was in negotiations with a possible acquisition
target. It refused, however, to comment on the company's identity.
'We have made contact with a UK company but it would be premature to say
more on the matter as our discussions are still at a preliminary stage,' the
company said. UAP hoped to conclude a UK deal before the end of 1994 but it
was 'unlikely' that the negotiations would be finalised 'for the next few
months'.
'I think it's going to be one of the smaller unquoted vehicles . . . a big
quoted company would be very difficult to digest,' said Mr Trevor May, an
analyst with BZW.
Mr Philip Hoyle, of Provincial Insurance, the UK's largest privately-owned
company and a rumoured UAP target, said yesterday that his company is 'not
in discussions with UAP'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the second half of its year, which ends on Monday, Forte's UK hotel and
restaurant businesses showed some improvement but trading in continental
Europe remained difficult, writes Michael Skapinker.
London hotel occupancies were healthy but average rates paid had been lower
than Forte previously hoped. However, rates had begun to recover in recent
weeks. Provincial hotels in the UK had begun to show some recovery but
hotels elsewhere in Europe still faced tough trading.
Volumes in UK roadside restaurants were static but spending per head had
grown. The Relais roadside chain in France had been adversely affected by
lower traffic volumes, but the company, bought at the end of 1992, was still
expected to be earnings enhancing in its first year.
Forte said the maturity of its debt had been further lengthened during the
second half of the year and borrowings had been reduced from Pounds 1.3bn in
July to less than Pounds 1.2bn.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Tyne Tees deficit less than
feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the ITV company, incurred lower-than-expected losses in
the year to September 30 following problems with its advertising sales.
When the deferred results were finally released yesterday the pre-tax
deficit turned out to be Pounds 7.88m on turnover of Pounds 236.8m.
In December, when the company warned of losses, it said they would not
exceed Pounds 9.5m. But for a Pounds 3m property provision taken this time
the deficit could have been even lower.
Staff costs were reduced by Pounds 8.1m and operating costs were cut by
Pounds 3.8m. Programmes sales reached a record Pounds 71.7m.
Mr Ward Thomas, the recently appointed chairman, said it had been a
difficult year 'because certain sales policies were pursued which damaged
the company both in terms of its reputation and perception.'
The final audited advertising sales figure of Pounds 150m was Pounds 34m
less than the forecast given to the board at the start of the year and
Pounds 20m less than the expection expressed to the board in the closing
weeks of the financial year.
As a result of the loss caused by rolled over debts on advertising,
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
stake - will not be paying a final dividend. That leaves shareholders with
3.3p for the year compared with 12p, which included an 8.7p final.
'We are taking steps to ensure that deal debt is not part of our future
trading practice,' said Mr Thomas, adding that all previous debt had now
been dealt with.
He warned that further stringent economies and a simplification of the
management structure were on the way.
Analysts expect the company to return to profit this year and a pre-tax
figure of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m is thought possible.
The company is joining other ITV companies in moving its year end to
December.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Severn Trent Pounds 11m Belgian acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent, the privatised utility, yesterday announced the expansion of
its Biffa waste management operation with an Pounds 11.1m acquisition in
Belgium.
The company is to buy Cotrans Group, a collector of domestic and industrial
waste, with sales of BFr600m (Pounds 11.1m). The deal will make Biffa one of
the leading waste services groups in Belgium and increase its sales there by
more than 50 per cent.
Mr Stephen Pain, of Severn Trent, said Cotrans would fit well with Biffa's
existing operation in the region. The Belgian company would benefit from
Biffa's landfill site and the waste pre-treatment centre under construction
near Antwerp. The acquisition also reinforced Severn Trent's commitment to
the waste services sector, he said.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Intercare restates accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intercare Group, the manufacturer and supplier of healthcare products,
yesterday restated figures in its 1992 accounts following discussions with
the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.
In the 1993 accounts published yesterday, the company amended items in its
cash flow statement after agreeing that it had departed from the
requirements of FRS 1, the accounting standard which deals with the
statement.
In the original version, it incorrectly included as cash items shares issued
as consideration for an acquisition, which were not cash flows.
Mr Gary Vicary, finance director, said: 'It's irritating. This was basically
a small technical misclassification. It has no impact on the profit and loss
account or the balance sheet and there was full disclosure in the accounts.'
The company is audited by Price Waterhouse in Manchester, which did not
qualify the 1992 accounts.
The Review Panel highlighted in a statement three errors made by Intercare:
cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries and cash inflow from financing
included sums that were not cash because they related to shares issued as
consideration for an acquisition
cash consideration for acquisition of subsidiaries did not include the
negative balances of cash and cash equivalents acquired in the subsidiary
undertakings
the figures shown for interest receivable and payable were not on a cash
basis, although the difference was not a material amount.

JP Morgan, the US merchant bank, has won the competitive tender to provide
finance for the UK Lottery Foundation, the lottery organisation set up by Mr
Richard Branson and Lord Young, the former cabinet minister.
The Foundation's bid for the national lottery licence will be underwritten
by JP Morgan. The sums involved are likely to be in the Pounds 50m to Pounds
100m range.
The UK Lottery Foundation plans to hand over all its profits to 'good
causes' if it wins the licence. There are at least seven other bidders who
argue that they will be able to raise more money for the five nominated
causes - the arts, charities, the millenium fund, national heritage and
sports.
Final date for bids is February 14 with the winner likely to be announced by
May.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a sharp fall in interest receivable, J&amp;J Dyson, the Sheffield-based
refractories group with interests in trailers and builders' merchanting,
lifted first half profits by 18 per cent but cut its interim dividend as
margins remained under 'the most severe pressure'.
Mr Richard Field, chairman, said the pre-tax increase for the six months to
end-September - from Pounds 340,574 to Pounds 401,340 - was spread across
all group businesses 'but very little of the improvement may be attributed
to any general increase in economic activity.'
Net interest receivable dropped from Pounds 124,708 to Pounds 16,963.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 20.9m. The reduced interim distribution of 1.5p
(2p) is payable from earnings of 2.03p (1.65p) per share.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Food retail shares hit by Sainsbury
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares dipped across the food retailing sector yesterday after J Sainsbury,
the market leader, revealed a fall in margins and like-for-like sales,
expressed caution over its profits and said it was making a Pounds 365m
property write-down.
The statement took the City by surprise and provided further evidence of a
new era in the food retailing industry of slower profits growth and physical
expansion amid increasingly fierce price competition.
Sainsbury's revealed an increase of only 4.6 per cent in total sales for the
16 weeks to January 15, and, crucially, a 1 per cent fall in like-for-like
sales - which exclude new stores - with no sales inflation.
That was in spite of Sainsbury's 'Essential for essentials' campaign,
launched in October. That involved cutting the price of 300 own-label goods
which, Sainsbury's admitted, knocked 0.4 percentage points off its gross
margin.
Its comment contrasted sharply with competitors such as Tesco, Asda, and
Gateway, which have all seen increases in like-for-like sales after cutting
prices.
Sainsbury's warned its profits would be 'adversely affected' and it expected
only a small increase over last year - before accounting changes announced
yesterday.
Those included a decision to depreciate buildings by 2 per cent a year -
following similar moves by Argyll and Tesco - and a revised depreciation
policy on fixtures and equipment, resulting in a recurring depreciation
charge of Pounds 40m.
There will also be a Pounds 365m non-recurring write-down on property, after
Sainsbury's admitted many of its sites were no longer worth what it paid for
them. Tesco made a similar move last week, but chose to depreciate the cost
over 25 years.
Sainsbury's had insisted until recently there was no need to revalue its
properties, but Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said it had responded to
pressure from the City. 'We wanted to clear the decks, to be whiter than
white, so that there could be no possible doubt over the quality of our
earnings in future,' he said.
But Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco, is not cutting back on its expansion
programme, and plans to open 20 superstores a year for four years. Beyond
that, the pace might slow.
The group also plans to accelerate expansion of its other retail chains,
Savacentre, Homebase, and Shaws in the US, which turned in stronger
performances than the superstore chain.
Mr Sainsbury said he believed the group could now hold its gross margin - a
claim questioned by analysts - because its 'essentials' campaign made it
cheaper than other superstore chains, and had removed the price advantage of
discounters such as Aldi and Netto.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sky is distant limit: 'The best kept secret in personal
finance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day of the week between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m pours into a single
unit trust run by Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial. The success of the new Higher
Income Plan in attracting almost Pounds 500m in under a year symbolises the
new competitive power of the unit trust industry as short-term interest
rates have fallen within the space of three and a half years from 15 to 5
1/2 per cent.
Unit trust companies celebrated a new record this week as net investment of
Pounds 9.1bn was announced for 1993, eclipsing the previous peak of Pounds
6.3bn in 1987. Total funds under management, boosted by the strength of
stock markets all around the world, rocketed by almost 50 per cent to Pounds
95.5bn during the year. A breach of the Pounds 100bn level is expected any
time.
Yet unit trusts still form a comparatively tiny part of the savings industry
in the UK. The industry's trade association Autif admitted this week that
probably no more than 1 1/2 m people out of a working population of 25m
invest their savings directly in unit trusts.
'We are the best-kept secret in personal finance,' said Autif's director
general, Mr Philip Warland, promising a 1994 campaign to boost awareness.
The British unit trust industry can only boggle at the amazing success of
its mutual fund counterpart in the US. Net sales of US mutual funds
(excluding money market funds) were Dollars 30bn in December 1993 alone.
Total assets held by equity and bond funds have reached almost Dollars
1,500bn, and there are mutual fund investors in 28 per cent of all American
households.
In the UK the unit trust industry is still struggling to establish its
independent identity. It operates under the shadow of the Pounds 400bn-plus
life assurance industry, which last year absorbed nearly half of unit trust
sales into unit-linked life products and other life portfolios.
Only Pounds 5bn worth of unit trusts were sold directly to the public last
year. Official statistics suggest that no more than Pounds 40bn or so in
units is directly held by the public.
But the sky is the limit. There are some very good reasons to believe that
unit trusts could greatly increase their share of the savings market in the
next few years.
Low short-term interest rates, likely to fall further to five per cent or
even less, will cause money to drain out of building society and bank
savings accounts. Investors will be looking for more attractive returns,
especially from the securities markets.
Hard-selling life companies are coming under regulatory pressure, and from
1995 will be required to disclose more clearly their relatively high charges
and onerous early cash-in penalties. Unit trusts, which have always had a
lower and more transparent charging structure, should benefit.
Unit trusts now qualify for one of the most attractive savings tax shelters,
the personal equity plan, which is exempt from taxes on both income and
capital gain (and they can also be packaged into personal pension plans).
Net sales of unit trust PEPs nearly trebled last year and accounted for a
third of overall business. The building societies, in particular, are under
great competitive pressure at present.
Until the past year or so Halifax Building Society on its own - with savings
deposits of some Pounds 50bn - was comparable in size to the entire unit
trust industry. But in the second half of last year deposits started to
drain out of the building societies. Most cheques accompanying application
forms, unit trust men say, are drawn on building society accounts.
Unit trusts have been slow to develop bond funds, the most direct
competitors to building society savings. Such funds, invested in fixed
income securities, are the biggest sellers for mutual fund groups in the US.
They are the natural first step for savings depositors who want higher
income but are unwilling to accept the risks of equity-based funds.
One problem in the UK is that pure bond funds are not 'peppable'. But the
Hypo F &amp; C product has been an ingenious answer. It is a complicated
package, consisting of a unit trust containing a balance of equities and
company loans, seasoned with derivatives and presented in a PEP wrapper.
It has been widely criticised for being opaque and for being possibly
vulnerable to unforeseen market hazards or design faults. But its promise of
a near-10 per cent yield has been eagerly welcomed by financial advisers
seeking high income for their clients.
More traditional unit trusts investing in risky equities have also been
booming. In December, for instance, the most popular sectors were UK smaller
companies and the Far East excluding Japan.
This week Autif's Mr Warland was enthusing over charts projecting a huge
increase in the unit trusts' share of the savings market by the year 2000.
'We must make unit trusts more understandable and accessible to the missing
23 1/2m savers.'

Sir, You are quite right to call for a tightening by the Federal Reserve
('Why the Fed should tighten', January 26). The Federal Reserve has nearly
duplicated the degree of excess that occurred during the early Carter years.
And similar bottlenecks are developing with respect to food supplies,
inadequate energy capacity, and extraordinarily low manufacturing inventory
levels. US price levels could not withstand a world recovery.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Regional role for BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP REEVELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The news that the BBC is conducting a feasibility study into situating
a national radio network outside London is to be welcomed ('Radio 2 may be
moved to Midlands', January 24). However, there is a case for arguing that,
on its own, this would not redress the imbalance between metropolitan and
non-London BBC operations.
The recent Heritage Committee report on the BBC recommended that regional
autonomy should be written into the BBC's charter. Re-potting a national
radio network outside London would not meet that requirement. What of the
remaining two English regions, and the three national regions? And what of
BBC television at a time when ITV's 'regional' structure is likely to buckle
under the weight of mergers and rationalisation?
BBC policies for regional broadcasting - local journalism, centres of
excellence and proportionality - should be part of a broader strategy for
regional devolution. This could be given a high-profile public focus if, for
instance, BBC2 were to support increased volumes of local programming and
significantly higher proportion of networked programmes produced by the BBC
centres and independent producers in the regions. To meet the needs of
regional audiences and provide substance to the policy of non-London
production each of the BBC's regional centres would have to be given
significant scheduling and commissioning responsibilities.
The fact that Radio 2 seems to have been singled out for relocation
indicates that, although BBC policy-makers are conscious of regional
weaknesses, they have yet to grasp the long-term significance of regional
autonomy as a unique feature of licence-fee funding for public broadcasting.
As the media revolution gathers pace, perhaps the BBC should bear in mind
the slogan of another revolution - 'no taxation without representation'.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commissioners' decision not
'political'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM BISHOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on the stainless steel tubes case ('Openness on open
markets', January 28) attributed Mr Van Miert's 'defeat' to 'political
considerations'. At least three of the Commissioners who voted against
action had no national or industry connections whatever. Moreover the whole
industry is tiny in EU political terms. And why did DGIV 'lose' this case on
the very day that it 'won' on state aid to two far more important and
politically influential industries?
The truth is more interesting: the independent Commissioners were not
persuaded by the case that Mr Van Miert's officials had assembled against
the merger. These officials had been asked to be first prosecutors and then
judges. Almost the whole history of western law teaches us that these two
functions ought not to be combined. Substantial evidence on international
markets, east European competition and structural decline was brushed aside
by enforcer-prosecutors who had prejudged the case. Moreover, the draft
decision was inconsistent with important previous merger decisions.
All this could be, and was, pointed out to the independent Commissioners.
They know that in merger cases an appeal to the courts is too slow to be an
effective check and therefore that they, the Commissioners, are the de facto
court of appeal. They take this responsibility seriously. In the stainless
steel tubes case they judged the officials' case against the merger and
found it unconvincing.

Sir, Re the government's justification for road pricing and higher motor
fuel taxes, research might well show that the 'social costs' of road use
amounted to between Pounds 23bn and Pounds 26bn in 1991, twice the amount
raised in road taxes ('Fading blueprint for a greener world', January 26).
But without a corresponding improvement in and subsidy for public transport
and alternative travel, does research show what the social costs will be for
a locomotively circumscribed 'curfew' society?

FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste not simple problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D E RIDDLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Georgina Watkins-Spies (Letters, January 27) advocates that Europe's
legislators force manufacturers to use less packaging, or more of the
reusable kind. This really is a very simplistic approach to a very
complicated problem, and it is worth quoting a letter from the German Coffee
Association to the German environment minister which was included in the
House of Lords European Communities Committee report on packaging and
packaging waste published on October 19 1993. The letter describes the
effects of replacing the composite aluminium and plastic lightweight film
packing of roast coffee in Germany by packaging in either tin-plate or
glass. The present 11,000 tonnes of film would have to be replaced by
120,000 tonnes of tin-plate, or 470,000 tonnes of glass. The result would be
to create more residual waste and require three times as many lorries to
transport and collect the materials.
This clearly is not sensible, and indeed in a related point, the 80 per cent
of plastics sorted in Germany is described as 'sheer madness' by the Duales
System Deutschland manager, Wolfram Bruck, also referred to in the House of
Lords report.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Punishment and prevention: Will President Clinton be able to
do anything to combat crime in the US?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday a teenager stood in front of Eliot Junior High School,
north-east Washington, and fired eight shots at a student who had failed to
return a borrowed coat. Mr Franklin Smith, superintendent of Washington DC
schools, was not surprised. Teenagers, he said, 'will shoot each other about
anything, about stepping on a toe'.
Such episodes help explain why President Bill Clinton put a crackdown on
crime at the top of his list of priorities in this week's State of the Union
address. He echoed governors of every political stripe, from Democrat Mr
Mario Cuomo in New York to Republican Mr Pete Wilson in California, in
lamenting a fear of violent crime that is 'crippling our society, limiting
personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us'.
Opinion polls show the number of people citing crime and violence as the
most serious issue facing the US has risen over the past year from about 2
per cent to 20 per cent or more, displacing the economy and unemployment as
the most pressing concern.
Anxiety about mounting violence may rest more on perception than on reality,
however. Justice Department surveys indicate that the number of people who
have been victims of violent crime in any given year has stayed flat for the
last two decades at between 29 and 34 per 1,000.
Nevertheless, the level of violent attacks on specific groups, such as
teenagers and black Americans, has risen sharply in recent years. And
overall rates of violent crime, although static, are exceptionally high in
comparison with most other developed countries: the US homicide rate is
seven times that of Canada, 20 times Germany's.
Levels of fear are heightened by incidents cited by Mr Clinton in his
speech: the abduction and subsequent murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas from
her bedroom in northern California; the racially motivated outburst that
left six people dead and 17 injured on a Long Island commuter train; the
attempted murder of a black tourist in Florida by three whites who poured
petrol over him and set him on fire. Perhaps most frightening are the
shootings by ever younger and more heavily armed gang members in inner
cities. Such attacks create a feeling that violence has spilled over to
invade traditional sanctuaries such as the family home or school.
It feels, as Professor Lawrence Friedman of Stanford University puts it in
his recent book Crime and Punishment in American History, 'like some
tremendous boxing match where the boxers, instead of pounding each other
inside the ring, suddenly jump through the ropes and begin mauling and
maiming the screaming audience'.
Crime is not a new issue in the political arena, but significant government
action has for years been immobilised by a polarisation between advocates of
repression and prevention; between those who want to build more prisons and
inflict tougher sentences and those who want to tackle crime's roots with
drug treatment and rehabilitation and inner-city job schemes.
'The left wants prevention and no punishment. The right wants punishment and
no prevention,' said Democrat Congressman Charles Schumer, chairman of the
House of Representatives subcommittee on crime.
Efforts to extend controls on guns have also - at least until recently  -
been immobilised. But in this area, for reasons rooted in the US's history,
constitution and political traditions, opposition to tougher measures has
come from the right. The left has found calls for gun control a
demonstration of its seriousness about tackling crime.
What is new in Mr Clinton's approach, at least for Washington, is the
willingness to take all three medicines - prevention, repression and gun
control - at once.
In his address on Tuesday he endorsed not only the 'three strikes and you're
out' initiative - a measure, backed by the Senate but not the House of
Representatives, to require a mandatory life sentence for a third violent
offence - but also community policing, an expanded police force, army-style
'boot camps' for young offenders, a ban on assault weapons and more money
for drug treatment, as well as job training and urban development measures.
As is traditional, Congress is also likely to extend the death penalty to 20
or 30 more offences. It will be a futile gesture, since violent crime and
its punishment are overwhelmingly dealt with by the states, not the federal
government: the last extension included esoteric federal crimes such as
murdering a federal egg inspector.
It will not be easy to maintain a coalition to pass all these measures in
Congress. The Senate has already passed a ban on assault weapons, but
resistance from the gun lobby to this measure will remain strong.
At the same time, many of the more leftwing members of the House -
especially some leading black representatives, whose experience in the 1960s
civil rights protests and since has given them reason to distrust the police
 -are hostile to what they see as egregious encroachments on civil liberties
passed by the Senate, including stiffer penalties for gang members, looser
standards of evidence, and draconian restrictions on parole.
But while the marriage of repression and prevention in President Clinton's
proposals may feel unnatural to many national politicians, it has already
taken place in public opinion and among local law enforcement officers. Gun
owners now say increasingly that they want more gun controls, and local
officials insist on the importance of urban development in the battle
against crime.
'In our view, lasting solutions lie in Washington's willingness to view
affordable housing as a weapon to fight crime, to view childcare, job
training, recreation programmes, community development and transportation to
jobs as weapons to fight crime,' a group of mayors and police chiefs wrote
in a letter to Mr Clinton last month.
Severe doubts must remain, however, about the capacity of any measures taken
by Washington to curb more than marginally the violence that plagues the US
 -not the least because criminal justice falls very much under local
jurisdiction.
By most standards the US criminal justice system is already tough. If
putting more people in prison kept criminals out of circulation, then crime
should have plummeted, for the prison population has climbed from 196,429 at
the end of 1970 to 789,347 at the end of 1991.
If capital punishment were the ultimate deterrent, the US should be
relatively free of violence, for it applies the death penalty in more and
more cases - including the execution of juvenile offenders, a practice
followed by only five other countries.
Nor is there any magic solution to be found in specific prevention
programmes, particularly if they are funded at the austere levels
necessitated by the US budget deficit. Many pilot schemes, such as intensive
pre-school monitoring of babies at risk from behavioural problems, or
handing over government housing to be managed by its residents, have
produced good results - but have been less encouraging when turned into
nationwide schemes.
Mr Clinton's greatest strength in tackling crime is his willingness to
address the problem in the context of 'a stunning and simultaneous breakdown
of community, family and work'. While there are no concrete or swift
solutions to be found in a moral crusade, Mr Clinton may be able to provide
leadership in this area. That in itself cannot be turned into programmes to
fit into a crime bill; as long as voters remain frightened of violence,
Washington will continue the search for measures that can.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Beyond the cyber-vampire: Challenges for video games makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the deafening sound of 'finish him' in your ears, Baraka (a demon with
blades for hands) decapitates yet another victim. Even more violent than the
original . . . this game features great enhancements,' enthuses Gamepro
magazine's review of Mortal Kombat II, the sequel to last year's
'top-grossing' video game hit.
Digital murder and mayhem may not appeal to everyone, but it is just what
the young males aged eight to 18 who buy 75 per cent of all video games
want. A glance at the US top 10 games proves the point: Mortal Kombat,
Street Fighter II, Streets of Rage 2, Tournament Fighters . . . Played with
hand-held controllers, two players to a machine that plugs into the TV set,
these are the games that absorb countless hours of youngsters' time.
The video game industry has grown fat on screen battles. Last year,
worldwide sales of home video game machines and game cartridges topped
Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), up from about Dollars 14bn in 1992. Yet there
are signs that after a decade of rapid growth, the video game craze may be
slowing down.
Nintendo of Japan, which along with rival Sega Enterprises dominates the
field, is projecting an 11 per cent decline in worldwide sales for its
fiscal year ending March 31 to Y500bn (Pounds 3bn). In the US, its largest
market, the company expects sales to remain flat for the year at Dollars
4.3bn.
Suddenly, the world seems to be ganging up on video game makers. The UK
Monopolies and Mergers Commission has launched an investigation of industry
pricing policies; US lawmakers are proposing bills that would censor video
game violence; competitors with more advanced technology are crowding into
the market; and others, offering new forms of home entertainment such as
interactive television, threaten to encroach on their turf.
A slowing rate of growth in the video games market is inevitable, says Mr
Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE); the
high growth rates of previous years were unsustainable.
To remain winners in this increasingly hostile environment, video game
makers must learn some new moves. Like the characters in their own products,
they face the possibility of extinction or the opportunity to jump to a new
level of game playing.
Mr Devereux, whose company is part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group,
argues that technological change - primarily the move from cartridge-based
games to compact disc read-only memory (CD-Rom) - will provide the
opportunity to draw new consumers into the market. CD-Roms, like audio
compact discs, can play music. However, they can also be used to store video
games or computer programs, or all of the above. Sales of multimedia
personal computers equipped with CD-Roms are booming in the US, with sales
expected to total 20m to 25m units over the next three years.
The multimedia PC represents new opportunities for video game software
developers which transfer their games to the CD-Rom format. With higher data
storage capacity, CD-Roms give writers more freedom to develop games based
on more detailed stories, incorporating live-action video. Sim City 2000,
for example, challenges players to build and manage a city of the future. As
the city ruler, the game player must build schools, pass laws and deal with
emergencies. 'Challenge scenarios' include firestorms, earthquakes and
tornados.
Such games, with intricate plots and developed story lines, may be the key
to the long elusive female video game buyer, some industry executives
believe. However, if video game publishers are to expand the demographics of
their market 'they are going to have to tone down their production values.
The vertiginous frenzy of most games probably does not appeal to most
adults, and the barrage of corny music is downright annoying,' says Mr
Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, an industry consulting
group.
To placate critics of violence, several developers have begun labelling
their games with a rating system akin to that used in the film industry.
Most companies will eliminate sequences that could be 'X-rated' to ensure
that their games are not banned by parents or toy stores, industry observers
predict.
CD-based products could, however, provide greater ammunition for critics who
claim the games encourage violence, Mr Devereux admits. The pictures on
CD-based games will be more vivid; Mr Devereux says this will make it more
difficult for children to distinguish between games and reality.
One example is Ground Zero Texas, a CD game soon to be released for the Sega
Genesis machine. With scenes reminiscent of Waco, Texas - including a fire
that engulfs the encampment - players in the role of government agents are
assigned to clean out the aliens. The characters are real actors and
actresses, in full-motion video.
In the broader home computing market, video games developers will be
competing with bigger fish. Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company, recently expanded its efforts in the consumer field, with programs
aimed at home computer users such as Creative Writer, which encourages
children to write with help from Maggie and Max, two cartoon characters.
The once distinct markets of video games and personal computers are
converging, as prices of the latest CD-equipped video game machines rise and
PC prices decline. And although there is still a Dollars 1,000 gap between
them, the educational and entertainment values promoted by the PC industry
appeal to a greater number of consumers than the raw grit of video games.
Also intensifying competition in the video games market is a new generation
of multi-player machines. One of the most promising is 3DO's 'interactive
multi-player', priced at about Dollars 700. The fledgling Californian
company has licensed two of Japan's leading consumer electronics
manufacturers, Matsushita and Sanyo, to produce versions of the system that
can play music CDs and video games.
Among the 20 or so games so far available for the 3DO multi-player is Mad
Dog McCree, based on a western gunslinger story, and Escape from Monster
Manor, a shoot-'em-up game. Both feature sophisticated graphics.
Looking further ahead, the ability to send video games - along with music,
films and retail catalogues - via cable television services into people's
homes, will create a new method of distribution to expand the games market.
And the next step in terms of technology will be 'virtual reality games',
which give the illusion of personally participating in the action. Players
wearing helmets that project images before their eyes - whichever way they
turn - might find themselves on a battlefield, driving a spaceship or
hacking their way through a jungle.
It will be several years before virtual reality becomes a consumer product,
most analysts predict. By then, perhaps the video game industry will have
more to offer than Mortal Kombat V or a sequel to Night Trap - a popular
game that depicts masked cyber-vampires who attach clamps and drills to the
necks of scantily clad young women.
Sex and violence will undoubtedly remain a staple of the video game, as of
other popular media. Yet as technology advances create opportunities for
increasingly life-like images, the maturing video game industry could move
beyond adolescent fantasies and comic-book style scripts - if it can muster
the art and imagination to do so.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Fury over French connection: The response to the Channel
rail link route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have to travel at least 50 miles north-west from Folkestone along the
route of the planned high-speed rail link from the Channel tunnel to London
before you meet people who are enthusiastic about the project.
At Stratford, in east London - not far from the link's final destination at
St Pancras station - a young woman at a jobs agency is thrilled that the
trains will stop just minutes from where she works.
'There will be a new shopping centre, new street furniture and green spaces
 -I think it will be the best thing that has happened to Stratford for a
long time,' she says.
In contrast to this flash of enthusiasm a trail of anger, confusion and
tragedy on small scale runs through the Kent countryside.
For six years residents have been in limbo, not knowing when the link will
be built, where it will be built and whether they will qualify for
compensation.
If anyone knows the meaning of planning blight it is Stuart Smith.
Two-and-a-half years after moving from a house in Lenham Heath which was
threatened by the original route of the link, he now faces the prospect of a
second move.
Revised proposals for the rail route, unveiled earlier this week by John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, could bring trains within yards of The
Mount, a Pounds 300,000 oak timber-framed farmhouse in the hamlet of Ram
Lane near Ashford to which Mr Smith and his family moved in 1991.
'We got a sensible price from British Rail for our last house but there was
no allowance made for the upset it caused,' he says. 'We had lived in that
house for 22 years and you can't compensate for that.'
Mr Smith is just one of thousands of home-owners who live near the 68-mile
railway line, which is intended to speed sleek express trains at up to
140mph through the Garden of England. If the government can persuade private
companies to invest at least half the Pounds 2.6bn cost of the project,
Eurostar trains should be slicing through the Kent countryside by 2002.
But before work starts on the line, Union Railways, the British Rail
subsidiary working on the early stages of the project, hopes to have
resolved the problems caused by years of planning blight. If the scale of
resident's protests is maintained, Union Railways' negotiators are in for a
tough time.
While David and Ivy Hilliger, at Westnell Lane, are relieved that the new
route will no longer run 30 yards from their back garden, they are not
celebrating. 'I don't think Union Railway realises just how much it is
affecting people's lives mentally. People in the village want to retire, but
don't know whether they will qualify for compensation.'
Mr MacGregor claimed that only 40 homes would be in the direct line of the
route. But this small number is only arrived at because of the narrowness of
the corridor which the government intends to 'safeguard' - that is, formally
declare as the line of the route, a move which triggers the right to
statutory compensation.
A final decision on the corridor has yet to be taken by the government, but
Union Railways says it is unlikely to be much wider than the 36 metres
between the fences required to protect a twin railway track. This is in
marked contrast to the 240-metre wide corridor declared by BR on its first
route, abandoned in 1991, which would have run through south London into
Waterloo.
BR spent Pounds 140m buying homes along this corridor, acquiring practically
the whole of the village of South Darenth and large swathes of Peckham. It
has since been selling these properties off at a large loss. Union Railways
says it has chosen a narrower corridor to keep costs down and reduce the
area of blight.
'BR got its fingers burned last time but now Union Railways is being far too
cautious,' says a Kent County Council official. In a recent study of the
rail link project, the council called for a more generous compensation
scheme for home-owners outside the 36-metre corridor.
One problem facing residents is that there is no agreement on standards
which should be applied to the disturbance that would be created by a fast
railway line. The government and the local authorities involved are still
discussing noise and vibration criteria.
Kent County Council complains the present limits under which compensation is
awarded are based on surveys of road noise carried out 20 years ago.
Motorways create a background hum but fast trains cause a sudden rush of
sound, it says.
But such technical details are of little concern to Pat and David Henderson.
Their three-bedroom semi-detached home on an estate at Pepper Hill near
Gravesend will be just 24 feet above a planned tunnel. Pepper Hill and
Ashford are the only two parts of the route which may be changed.
The Hendersons were hoping to sell up, buy a smaller house and put some
money in the bank. But they have seen their home plummet in value from
nearly Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 60,000 in a few years. 'Estate agents say
they won't even put us on their books,' says Mrs Henderson.
Despite the uncertainties surrounding compensation, Union Railways says it
is prepared to be more flexible than the law provides for. In theory, it
cannot purchase properties compulsorily before the passage of the rail link
bill through parliament, expected to take at least two years. But it says it
will offer compensation as soon as an order safeguarding the route is
published in the next few weeks. Compensation legislation allows it to offer
market value plus up to 10 per cent.
Home-owners in the direct line of the route will automatically be eligible
for compensation but people living near but not on the line will have to
apply to Union Railways. Estate agents will be asked to value properties.
Only those 'very close' to the rail are likely to be bought while double
glazing may be available for those living further away.
Double glazing would not assuage the fears of Arthur Reeves, who runs a used
car business next door to the Garden of England Mobile Home Park outside
Harrietsham. Its pretty setting - old army ambulances and rusty Rolls Royces
stand between the trees surrounding the house - is ruined by the drone of
the M20 motorway which runs in front of the house. The Channel link,
according to the latest plans, will run on his side of the motorway,
compounding an already serious noise problem.
'They say that when the link is complete, there will be trains running every
10 minutes.' says Mr Reeves.
Union Railways insists that local residents' fears are exaggerated and that
modern railways are built to such high standards that they will not create
the noise and vibration many expect. But even if this turns out to be the
case, the insecurity is causing unhappiness in Kent.
'There has been a lot of illness, and a lot of mental strain,' says Mrs
Margaret Bottle, of Harrietsham, pointing out houses purchased by BR and now
standing empty. 'It has been hanging over us for so long, and we can't get
any sense out of Union Railway. They will not give us any straight answers.
We won't know what any of this means to us, until the first train makes its
first trip.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Man in the News: Cut and blow-dry is not enough - John Meyer
/ John Major's new press secretary has a tough task to revamp his master's
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Christopher Meyer has walked into the most difficult job in Whitehall.
This week the 49-year-old official swapped the careful diplomacy of the
Foreign Office for the post of press secretary in No 10 Downing Street. His
task: to restore lustre to Mr John Major's government.
You can understand why he might feel daunted. The Conservative party and the
government it is supposed to sustain in office are gripped by yet another
crisis of confidence. The common thread has been a failure to demonstrate
purpose and grip.
From the furore over ministers' extramarital activities through the fiasco
over the back-to-basics policy to the row over taxes, the government has
appeared paralysed in the headlights of a succession of oncoming trucks.
As one minister sighed wearily: 'For a government so accident-prone it's
extraordinary that we have yet to discover how to mount a decent
damage-limitation operation.'
It will be Mr Meyer's role to minimise the accidents and clear up the mess
when they happen.
He comes confidently and willingly to the job. A fluent Russian speaker with
a French wife and three children, he is every inch the Foreign Office high
flyer. Formerly number two in the Washington embassy his next job is likely
to be ambassador in one of Britain's largest overseas posts, probably
Moscow, where he served in the early 1980s.
He likes journalists. He learnt the briefing trade from the abrasive Mr
Bernard Ingham who served for a decade as Lady (then Mrs Margaret)
Thatcher's press secretary. For five years during the same period, Mr Meyer
served Sir Geoffrey Howe, the then foreign secretary, in the same role. The
two were a formidable double-act on overseas trips.
Mr Meyer enjoys the combat involved in selling policy to sceptical
journalists. He is sufficiently self-assured to believe that more often than
not he will come out on top in such encounters.
In preliminary sparring this week with members of that arcane Westminster
club, the parliamentary lobby, his demeanour carried a simple message: don't
try to push me around.
But the journalists will do just that. Among the myriad of problems facing
the prime minister is a near-complete breakdown in relations between No 10
Downing Street and large sections of the press. The conventions which once
made for a civilised, if occasionally explosive, relationship with the
lobby's hard-nosed political reporters have all but broken down.
Conservative newspapers such as The Sun and the Daily Mail have made it
clear they have all but given up on Mr Major. Other editors echo privately
the view that the prime minister is incapable of rebuilding his authority.
In Mr Meyer's twice-daily briefings for two dozen or so lobby correspondents
 -all his comments are unattributable and thinly disguised in such phrases
as 'Downing Street said' - he will be at the sharp end of the
disenchantment.
Several recent episodes show what he is up against. In unguarded moments, Mr
Major has been heard describing right-wing cabinet colleagues as 'bastards'
and backbench opponents as 'barmies'. More recently he was said to have used
rather stronger language against his party's right wing. This latest row
probably owed more to journalistic hyperbole than to reality. But that is
not the point. In different circumstances all such remarks would have gone
unreported: a strong prime minister could threaten to slam the door on a
newspaper's future access.
But Mr Major's position is anything but strong. Journalists do not fear him.
So the self-discipline which would normally hold in check those who earn a
living from mixing with politicians has disappeared.
The prime minister is too nice, too trusting until recently of the
journalists he befriended during an uninterrupted rise to prominence during
the 1980s. Mr Meyer will be expected to provide a hard edge to his image.
There is another challenge. Mr Meyer's political master eschews ideology. He
prefers, instead, political pragmatism and problem-solving. But the lesson
of his premiership has been that the government must display a sense of
strategic purpose. It has also to learn to replace abrupt U-turns with
gentle swerves when the going gets rough.
The press secretary will have to find words in his briefings to fill the
philosophical vacuum. Governments can prosper without a grand design or big
idea, but not without a rhetorical framework for policy.
Mr Meyer faces other constraints. Mr Major's leadership is the focus of the
present storm. If the Conservatives suffer disastrous, as opposed to just
heavy, losses in this summer's local and European elections, he will find it
hard to remain in office.
But his party - and his ministerial colleagues - must bear much of the
blame. After 15 years in power and two years of civil war, the Conservatives
may have reached the stage where they are unwilling or unable to sustain any
leader in office.
The party has lost the habit of discipline. It has replaced self-control
with a propensity to panic at the slightest excuse. The latest row over the
impending tax increases provides a classic example.
Backbench Tory MPs have been behaving this week as if no one had told them
that taxes were going up. No matter that it was spelled out in no uncertain
terms in two Budgets last year, the second of which they applauded
vigorously only two months ago.
As one senior Whitehall official commented with more than an edge of
contempt: 'The Tories don't appear to understand that when you put taxes up
people have to pay more.'
The indiscipline has not been confined to the backbenches. Cabinet ministers
and some of their more junior colleagues have engaged in the sort of public
jostling which has fuelled speculation that Mr Major is under threat.
Mr Michael Portillo's decision to raise his public profile has given the
impression that the youthful chief secretary to the Treasury wants to
reinforce his credentials as the favourite of the Tory right.
Friends of friends of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, are
reminding colleagues that he is now fully fit after his heart attack.
Those who would like to see Mr Douglas Hurd fill No 10 are whispering that
we should not take too seriously his (genuine) protestations that he sees
his stewardship of the Foreign Office as a last job in politics.
The prospective candidacy of aggressively self-confident Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor and clear favourite in any race for the succession, tends to
speak for itself.
Much of the feverish speculation is simply the product of the Westminster
hothouse, of backbench Tory MPs with too little to do and no future under
the present leadership. But rushing from radio to television studios,
cabinet colleagues are not always fulsome in their praise for the prime
minister.
In the words of one, rather more circumspect, member of the prime minister's
inner circle: 'Too many people are setting out their stalls. We need a bit
more loyalty and a lot less self-promotion.'
Mr Meyer understands the problems. He will attempt to influence policy as
well as presentation. In a revealing paper he wrote during a year's
sabbatical at Harvard University, he summed up the role of the press
secretary as 'always to take and hold the initiative in public debate'. To
do that, he or she had to be at the centre of policy-making.
Friends from his Washington days say that he was both street-wise and
carefully attuned to the internal politics of the US Administration. They
confirm the impression that he was thinking personally when he stressed in
the same paper that press secretaries should 'see the job not as an exercise
in defensive play and damage-limitation (though these are often needed) but
as a series of daily opportunities to score points and to shape the agenda'.
No one doubts that he will be good at doing just that. What Mr Meyer cannot
be sure of is whether it will be enough. From his office in Downing Street,
he has no standing in or influence on the dark manoeuvrings of the Tory
party. He is a civil servant, pledged to keep out of politics. But it is the
process of politics - and specifically the slow disintegration of the
Conservative party - with which Mr Major cannot get to grips.
Perhaps no leader could. There are many in the party's senior ranks who
believe that the Tories will not solve their own or the country's problems
by getting rid of the present leader. Mr Meyer must help ensure that view
prevails.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Man bites watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When a securities watchdog declares that the regulatory system is operating
pretty well and requires no substantial remedial treatment, it comes as
something of a surprise. When the regulator in question is the US Securities
and Exchange Commission, a watchdog whose genetic make-up carries more than
a hint of the bloodhound about it, the response is more one of shock. It is,
in the argot of the Fourth Estate, a cross between a non-story and a
man-bites-dog story. Expectations have been confounded by the SEC's Market
2000 Report, which was finally published on Thursday after a year and a
half's gestation.
With US equities reaching levels that prompt discussion of bubbles and
crashes both on Wall Street and elsewhere, market hubris might appear to
have infected the SEC's Division of Market Regulation. Just as the 1987
Crash spawned serious worries about the impact of derivatives trading on
equity prices, a Crash of '94 or '95 would surely reveal some other cause
for regulatory concern. That, after all, is the history of financial
regulation: deregulation followed by reregulation, in a perpetual rhythm
that follows the ebb and flow of the market tide.
Before writing off the report as a gigantic hostage to stock market fortune,
however, it is worth putting scepticism to one side and asking whether there
might not be a case for insouciance. The most hard-headed argument could be
that in an increasingly global market the fall-out from a collapse on Wall
Street would be felt more severely everywhere else. Less enthusiastic
watchdogs in less developed markets could well be at greater risk than the
SEC. This is because the old adage about America sneezing and the rest of
the world catching a cold applies with unprecedented force to today's
markets.
Emerging markets
The striking feature of the present economic cycle is that the capital
markets have hijacked the normal functions of the banking system. The
penalty for holding cash in the US, where short-term interest rates are at
their lowest for 30 years, is such that savers have rushed into mutual funds
and other forms of investment which, unlike bank deposits, involve market
risk. As Wall Street has looked increasingly expensive to fund managers,
they have diversified into foreign markets. And the benefits of such
diversification are particularly marked in emerging markets, where corporate
performance operates much more independently of the US cycle than in the
OECD area.
Looked at from an American perspective, the investment in emerging markets
is small in relation to the total institutional portfolio. The outflow is
much less worrying than in the case of banking flows to the Third World in
the 1970s and early 1980s, because mutual funds and pension funds do not
operate on a slender base of capital; they are ungeared institutions, and
any loss from falling markets falls not on the institution itself but on
individuals and, in the case of defined benefit pension schemes after a long
time lag, on companies. And whereas the Third World banking flows were as
much a response to regulatory restrictions at home as to carefully assessed
opportunities abroad, the present equity flows are based on more
straightforward judgments about risk and relative return.
Healthy correction
A US securities watchdog could thus take the view that, if a rise in US
interest rates causes some repatriation of funds as stock markets fall, this
will be no more than a healthy correction at home, even if it causes an
earthquake in several Asian and Latin American economies. The position would
be analogous to the Japanese banks' stampede into property markets in the
US, Britain and Australia, at the peak of the real estate bubble in the late
1980s. The banking authorities in the English-speaking world took a
complacent view because the fall-out from the more imprudent Japanese
lending would do most damage to the capital base of the Japanese banking
system.
That said, globalisation poses new problems for securities regulators, just
as it does for monetary policy. If the specific, albeit minor, rule changes
in the Market 2000 report nonetheless appear onerous to investment
institutions and companies, they will go offshore. The history of the
Euromarkets is all about the impact of different relative levels of
regulation on the location of financial activity. Capital gravitates
naturally to those financial centres where the fiscal and regulatory hurdles
are easiest to overcome.
The other snag for today's securities watchdogs is that values in the
political market place are very different from those in financial markets.
It may matter little in economic terms if US private investors come unstuck
in junk bonds in Latin America. But if enough people are hurt it could
become politically sensitive and rebound on the SEC. The learning curve in
cross-border investment is long and arduous, as some of the world's most
sophisticated banks have recently found to their cost. Market 2000 still
looks a mite too complacent.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Signals show delays ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is not a man in a hurry, writes
Kevin Brown. British Rail may gaze enviously across the Channel at the
high-speed line on which its French counterpart will run 180mph trains when
the Channel tunnel opens in May. But there is no Gallic elan about Mr
MacGregor. Like a little-used Scottish branch line, he meanders slowly
towards his destination, certain he will get there but unsure when or how.
Announcing his 'final' decision on the high-speed line in the House of
Commons, Mr MacGregor was given a relatively friendly reception by Kent's
Conservative MPs. Bitter opposition was confined to Labour MPs from Essex
and east London constituencies crossed by the line. But Mr MacGregor knows
that almost every MP affected by the line will seek changes, some costing
tens of millions of pounds. Worse, it will be time-consuming.
Mr MacGregor says he wants to have fast trains running at full speed on the
line around the turn of the century. Unfortunately for the government,
Parliament has developed a special means of debating such legislation: the
hybrid bill procedure. It is potentially a nightmare for Mr MacGregor.
The main difference between a hybrid bill and a normal bill is the insertion
of a second committee stage - the stage at which bills are considered line
by line - by a select committee of MPs. A hybrid bill select committee has a
quasi-judicial function. It takes evidence from supporters of the project
and objectors, sets its own timetable, and is protected from party political
pressures by the rules of the Commons. An objection, known as a petition,
can be filed for Pounds 2; all petitions must be considered, although
similar ones can be grouped. When the bill emerges from the Commons, the
whole procedure is repeated in the Lords.
The government hopes the bill will take about two years to pass through
Parliament. But critics of the project think the tactical opportunities
presented by the procedure mean it can be dragged out to at least three
years. The Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill, they recall, took six.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, says the opposition will not
formally oppose the bill. But it will support petitioners such as Mr Andrew
MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, who wants a 1 1/2 mile tunnel to protect
householders in his Thames-side constituency. 'The skill is going to be in
getting a large number of people to spend Pounds 2 to petition against the
bill. I don't think we are going to have difficulty at all in doing that,'
he says. 'John MacGregor says he can get this up and running by the end of
the century . . . He is not going to get anywhere near that timetable unless
he comes to his senses.'
The sentiment, if not the language, is shared by some Conservative MPs. Mr
Andrew Rowe, Tory MP for mid-Kent, also wants a tunnel, to protect the
pretty Boxley valley between Maidstone and the Medway towns. Mr Rowe says he
is anxious not to delay the bill unduly. But he adds: 'Delaying the bill is
the only weapon we have, and if that is what we have to do then so be it . .
. It should be possible to do a deal on the basis that if they are a bit
less bloody-minded on what we want, we will be a bit less bloody-minded
about the bill.'
It is a view held privately by many of Mr MacGregor's nominal supporters.
But finding a way through the maze of objections without seriously inflating
the cost of the line will be a Herculean task. Mr MacGregor looks more like
Sisyphus, condemned forever to push an uphill burden.

FT  29 JAN 94 / One-stop advice centres ill-conceived, Major told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The president of Leeds Chamber of Commerce last night used a dinner attended
by Mr John Major to attack the government's 'ill thought-out' proposals on
services to industry and commerce. He said these were putting his chamber's
future at risk.
Mr David Richardson said: 'Commerce and industry are being burdened with new
schemes and initiatives dreamed up by civil servants and politicians when
they take on a new post - and which often get forgotten once they move on to
pastures new.'
Mr Richardson, a partner in the surveying firm of Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith,
was speaking at the chamber's annual dinner where Mr Major was guest of
honour. He attacked proposals for 'Business Links' - the one-stop shops
offering advice and support to industry.
'We are caught in the middle of a confused struggle between government
departments to provide an ill thought-out scheme which few people are
certain is really needed,' he said.
'This chamber has been representing its members for more than 200 years and
I have no intention of being caught up in a scheme which puts our financial
future at risk, particularly since it could end up on the scrap heap if the
Treasury turns off the financial tap. We will work with the government, but
not at any price.'
Business Links are promoted by the Department of Trade and Industry as
centralised providers of support services. Previously this role has been
partly fulfilled by chambers.
A year ago Leeds chamber was asked by the government to jointly bid with
Leeds City Council and the local training and enterprise council to run a
one-stop shop, offering services in competition with itself.
Mr Richardson appealed to Mr Major to end the confusion and concentrate
responsibility in one department, the DTI.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Warning on mines compensation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers and landowners who suffer from the effects of mining may not be
properly compensated after privatisation of the coal industry, the Country
Landowners Association said yesterday.
Its statement follows a similar warning from the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors. The Department of Trade and Industry said the
association had misunderstood the privatisation bill.
The association said the obligation on private-sector mining companies would
be limited to expected costs over the next 12 months. It said it was not
clear what would happen to claims at a later date if the operator ran into
difficulty.
The DTI said there would be an annual review but in some cases the
liabilities could go up each year.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Legal battle over Aids drug widens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers acting for the widow of a British Aids victim said yesterday they
had widened the legal battle over the claimed toxic effects of AZT, the most
widely prescribed anti-Aids drug.
They are extending their case against Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company,
to include a US government agency.
Mrs Susan Threakall claims her haemophiliac husband's death was caused by
the drug AZT and not by Aids, solicitor Mr Graham Ross said. She says her
husband was given AZT only because of unjustified claims made for the drug
by Wellcome and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
Her case against Wellcome was announced earlier this month. The company said
it would defend the case vigorously.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Lautro to impose heavier fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry, is to warn
members that those who fail the second round of inspection visits can expect
heavier penalties.
This tough line will be set out in a statement expected in the second half
of next month.
The second round of periodic visits to member firms has begun and the fines
imposed on those who do not meet the regulator's standards are likely to
emerge within the next couple of months. Lautro has imposed a series of
fines within the last few weeks.
Early in January it fined Life Association of Scotland Pounds 145,000 - a
near-record amount - for failing to screen and supervise its sales force
properly. Among other faults, the company ignored the warnings of its own
compliance officer about the behaviour of some sales agents. The following
week Crown Life was fined Pounds 130,000 for failing to control its internal
affairs responsibly and for employing a sales agent who had been convicted
of illegal deposit-taking - an activity Crown Life allowed him to continue.
On Thursday Laurentian Life, the life and pensions company, was fined Pounds
70,000 for breaches of Lautro rules over a four-year period to July 1992.
These offences included selling investors policies they could not afford,
and failing to record investors' existing policies.
Lautro's decision to take a tougher stance was first signalled last November
in a statement by Mr Barry Sherlock, its chairman.
He said that the one-in-six failure rate in the first round of visits was
unacceptable. 'Those failing at the second round must expect disciplinary
action and are likely to face tougher penalties,' he added.
Next month's statement is also expected to set Lautro's approach to fining
in context. The regulator believes that bad publicity for firms can be as
much of a penalty and deterrent as the fines.
Fimbra, the self-regulating body for financial advisers, announced yesterday
that fees for member firms for 1994-95 would rise by an average 17 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Boost in exports narrows non-EU trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising exports helped the UK narrow its visible trade deficit with countries
outside the European Union in December. The seasonally adjusted deficit of
Pounds 675m, compared with Pounds 773m in November, was slightly better than
analysts' expectations.
Exports to non-EU countries were Pounds 5.01bn in December, up from Pounds
4.78bn in November, while imports were Pounds 5.69bn (Pounds 5.55bn),
according to figures published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday.
The total deficit for non-EU visible trade last year was Pounds 9.54bn,
compared with Pounds 9.75bn in 1992. If oil and erratic items such as
precious stones are excluded, December's deficit was Pounds 450m, down from
Pounds 689m in November. The annual deficit excluding oil and erratics rose
slightly to Pounds 7.62bn, compared with Pounds 7.47bn in 1992.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, yesterday pointed out
that the value figures for UK exports have continued to grow at a faster
rate than the volume statistics, indicating that UK companies have taken the
opportunity of a lower pound to improve their margins.
In volume terms exports (excluding oil and erratics) were 12 per cent higher
in the last three months of 1993 than they were in the fourth quarter of
1992 while imports were 10 per cent ahead. In value terms, non-oil and
erratic exports were 27 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of last year
than in the same period in 1992 and imports were 12 per cent higher. The
figures back up the export confidence displayed in the Confederation of
British Industry's quarterly survey of industrial trends, published earlier
this week.
In the three months to December, exports of finished manufactures were 28
per cent higher, in value terms, than in the fourth quarter of 1992.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Car industry fears diesel crisis: Sales surge could be
jeopardised by government report on pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of the surge in diesel-vehicle sales in the UK new-car market has
caught the motor industry by surprise.
Sales rose from fewer than 10,000 a year at the start of the 1980s to about
120,000 in 1988 - 6 per cent of the market. Last year the total was 340,472,
a fifth of the market. The rise has continued this month.
An angry industry was last night wondering whether the boom will be slowed
or even halted by publication of the Department of the Environment's Quality
of Urban Air Review Group study.
The report warned that a bigger diesel-car population could lead to a
worsening of emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) and particles containing
carcinogens - claims rejected by the industry. A similar report in Germany
in the late 1980s brought diesel car growth to a halt, although it is now
recovering.
While the industry claims that it has no reason to favour either form of
vehicle, it fears confusion among motorists about the merits or hazards of
diesel cars may lead to deferred purchasing decisions, slowing the new-car
market's recovery from recession.
Diesels have been the single-biggest growth sector as motorists have been
attracted by the 25 per cent to 30 per cent better fuel economy compared
with petrol equivalents. This is particularly so now that purchase-price
premiums demanded for diesels are reducing sharply.
Growth has also been encouraged by a widespread view that diesels are more
environmentally friendly than petrol engines, partly because they produce
substantially less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, thus helping to combat
global warming.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail Motor Industry
Federation and leading component makers all argue that the report - which
they complain was compiled without consulting industry sources - ignored
several factors. These include developments in engine technology, specific
advantages of diesel engines during short, urban journeys, and the greater
consistency of diesel emissions over the life of a vehicle compared with the
breakdown in efficiency of petrol engines.
According to Mr John Mardell, chief engineer at Lucas Diesel Systems,
although Nox emissions initially are higher than with a petrol car, the
emissions even from a catalyst-equipped petrol car worsen steadily over the
vehicle's life so that the total balances out. On short journeys, pollutant
emissions from a petrol car can be 16 times higher than with a diesel, Mr
Mardell says.
Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive, says that 85 per cent of vehicle
pollution is attributable to elderly or poorly maintained vehicles.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Scott probe hears of 'shambles' at DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitehall manoeuvrings over a trial at the heart of the arms-for-Iraq affair
were a 'shambles', a top civil servant told the Scott inquiry yester-day.
Mr Michael Coolican, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's Export
Control Organisation, described the lack of co-ordination between Whitehall
departments and confused legal advice in oral evidence: 'We (the DTI) were
in a state of not knowing what documents should not be disclosed or why . .
. it was done in an unco-ordinated fashion, a shambles.'
Mr Coolican referred to his own state of 'anxiety' after discovering that
Customs was prosecuting a company for exporting goods that had earlier been
approved by government ministers apparently for intelligence reasons.
'I had seen a stream of submissions going to ministers saying 'let's approve
these exports, don't hang around, there's nothing wrong with them', and here
is Customs saying that there is,' he said.
On October 1 1992 - 11 days before the start of the Matrix Churchill trial -
Mr Coolican wrote to another official complaining about the way the
prosecution was being handled by Whitehall and Customs.
At the time officials were getting conflicting advice from lawyers on how
ministers should use public interest immunity certificates to withhold
documents of relevance to the defence. 'The reasons we look like a bunch of
bungling amateurs is because we are being asked to do what we have never
been asked to do before,' Mr Coolican wrote.
Questioned persistently by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Ms Presiley
Baxendale QC about his own involvement in the trial, Mr Coolican admitted
that his own witness statement should have been 'fuller'. The statement,
drafted under legal advice, had omitted a reference to machine tools granted
export licences after intelligence indicated they were being used to bolster
Iraq's military capacity.
Mr Coolican also told the inquiry how DTI officials had concluded that
advice given to Mr John Major, the prime minister, by Sir Robin Butler, the
cabinet secretary, had been misleading. Sir Robin's advice was that
government had not known about the military applications of Matrix Churchill
exports.
In further written evidence, described by the judge as 'extremely useful',
Mr Coolican has listed attempts by Whitehall since 1990 to boost efficiency
in its export-control procedures, such as requirements for information on
defence-related exports and closer co-ordination between officials and the
intelligence agencies.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, has been asked to give
written evidence by the Scott inquiry, it emerged last night. Mr Aitken told
the Commons this week that Saudi Arabia was under no obligation to give
details of the end-users of defence equipment supplied by Britain under the
Al-Yamamah defence deal.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Insolvency blueprint under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals for restructuring insolvency law appear to have little
chance of rescuing many more businesses, it emerged yesterday.
A survey conducted by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the
leading industry body, suggests that the recession explains a high
proportion of company failures - so proposals to defer creditors launching
insolvency proceedings would have little chance of improving survival rates.
The Department of Trade and Industry issued a consultation document last
November calling for radical changes to insolvency law, including granting
companies a one-month 'stay of execution' from creditors.
Yet analysis of 1,593 companies that failed in the first half of last year
shows that insolvency practitioners believe recessionary factors are the
main cause of collapse.
Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at accountants Price Waterhouse and
president of the society, stressed that the profession had not yet submitted
its response to the government's proposals and that the survey only provided
limited information.
However, Mr Homan added: 'You can't legislate against insolvency. The way to
cut down on company failures is to have a stable economic environment.'
Practitioners ranked loss of markets as the main reason for company failure
in 47 per cent of cases, and as an important contributory factor for 63 per
cent of business insolvencies.
They believed that a negotiated compromise achieved with a stay of action by
creditors would have provided a realistic prospect of survival in just 3 per
cent of cases.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
B&amp;I Line services between Dublin and Holyhead in north Wales have been
suspended after the company's 20,000-tonne Isle of Innisfree ferry hit a
berthing pontoon in rough weather at Holyhead.
The pontoon was damaged, preventing the vessel, with 146 passengers on
board, from docking. It returned to Dublin. B&amp;I said the accident meant the
company would not be able to operate its twice-daily services between Dublin
and Holyhead until February 8.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Health hospitality bill criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Health spent Pounds 211,531 - Pounds 579 a day - on
entertainment in 1992-93, a 74 per cent rise over 1990-91, Labour claimed
yesterday.
'Virginia Bottomley has got her priorities all wrong,' said Ms Dawn
Primarolo, who speaks for Labour on health. 'This money should be spent on
patient care - not entertainment, food and drink for ministers.'
Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, claimed the money was spent mainly on tea
and coffee. The department had underspent its hospitality budget for this
year, he said.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Trustees silent on plan for gallery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trustees of the National Gallery of Scotland declined to comment last
night after meeting to discuss a controversial plan to create a new gallery
of Scottish art in Glasgow. This would entail closing the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.
The plan has aroused considerable opposition. This week the government told
the House of Lords that it had the final say on the issue, which could
require legislation.
It suggested that the trustees were 'putting the cart before the horse' in
deciding to go ahead with the project and choosing its location without
formally submitting its plans to the government.
Before the meeting Mr Angus Grossart, chairman of the trustees, said they
would be 'progressing' their formal submission.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Title switch for Terry Venables
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Terry Venables' job title when he takes over the running of the England
football team will be 'coach' and not 'manager', the Football Association,
the governing body of English soccer, announced yesterday.
Mr David Davies, FA director of public affairs, said Mr Venables would not
inherit the limited administrative and commercial responsibilities exercised
by his predecessor, Mr Graham Taylor.
The change in title reflects the FA's desire to emphasise that it is
restructuring English international football following the country's failure
to qualify for this year's World Cup. It is not a substantial change in the
job.
Mr Davies said yesterday's press conference at Wembley stadium to announce
Mr Venables' appointment was 'the biggest attendance in English football for
this sort of event'.
Mr Venables said he intended to pursue both his action against Tottenham
Hotspur for wrongful dismissal and to sue BBC TV for libel over a Panorama
programme about his financial dealings.

FT  29 JAN 94 / BA pays Virgin Pounds 2.6m to settle row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday agreed to pay Virgin Atlantic Airways Pounds 2.65m
plus costs to settle the first of the bitter disputes between the two
airlines, Rachel Johnson writes.
That dispute arose in 1988 when BA held a contract to maintain Virgin's
aircraft.
Virgin alleged that BA caused engineering damage to Virgin's aircraft on
five occasions that year. One aircraft was grounded for two months during
the peak summer holiday season, forcing Virgin to charter replacements, the
company said.
BA argued that the payout was 'modest in relation to the nearly Pounds 6m
demanded' to settle the long-running dispute.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said: 'This is the second time that
BA have denied any liability and refused to settle a valid claim for damages
and then capitulated at the 11th hour.'
The maintenance settlement is separate from the 'dirty tricks' claim, which
emerged in January last year.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Ulster MP claims shift by Catholics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing number of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland see their long-term
future within the UK, Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford,
said last night.
He said Catholics in Ulster feared that their quality of life would suffer
in a united Ireland, while in the Irish Republic people had turned their
backs on old-style republicanism and re-unification was no longer a
priority.
Mr Taylor said the economics of a united Ireland would be disastrous and he
predicted mass emigration for hundreds of thousands.
He told his party's Mid-Ulster constituency association: 'Thinking Catholics
and Protestants do not want to suffer such an experience and that is why the
greater number of people in Northern Ireland, including an increasing number
of Catholics, want to remain in the UK and have improved relations between
north and south.'
If Northern Ireland left the UK, Mr Taylor said it would cost the republic
Pounds 3.5bn a year - about Pounds 10,000 for every man, woman and child -
to maintain the same level of public services and quality of life.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein fails to clarify or unify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-two years ago tomorrow a protest march heading for Londonderry's
Guildhall ran into the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment and 'Bloody Sunday'
became a part of Ireland's historic agony. Yesterday, 3,000 lives later, the
same building played out another chapter in the still unfolding drama.
In a hall just along from the memorial window commemorating the 13 who died
violently on the streets of the Bogside, Sinn Fein's 'peace commission' sat
to listen to the public's views on the latest, joint effort by Dublin and
London to bring an end to the suffering.
The hearing, conducted on quasi-judicial lines, gave individuals and
organisations their chance to state their case, though the six-strong
commission panel - drawn from Sinn Fein's executive - cut short any attempts
to enter into debate. Further sessions are planned for Dublin, Cork and
Galway, after which Sinn Fein says it will make public its findings.
Those speaking yesterday included community groups from the Bogside ghetto,
ex-prisoners and non-affiliated organisations committed to reconciliation.
One by one, they offered graphic descriptions of the city's barricade
culture or traced the messy history of 'unionist hegemony'.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a senior Sinn Fein official and the man identified by
security forces as IRA chief of staff, sat quietly in the audience.
If the panel had expected ringing endorsement from a partisan gathering for
its repeated demands for clarification of the joint declaration, it was
quickly disabused.
Mr Jon McCourt, from Derry's Peace and Reconciliation Group, wanted to ask
if Sinn Fein would clarify what it meant by clarification and whether, if
the majority of submissions to the commission demanded an end to violence,
the republican movement would respond positively. His questions were
disallowed, on the grounds that they constituted a dialogue. Only the
commission, he complained later, was apparently allowed to ask questions.
Mr John Robb, a former senator in the Irish republic, said that while Sinn
Fein demanded that the British government should be seen as a persuader in
bringing about a political settlement, the party itself could be persuasive
in urging the IRA to end its campaign. He warned that the longer the IRA
pursued its tactics, the better armed and better organised the loyalist
paramilitaries would become.
Mr Tony Carlin, a former mayor of Derry, said the merest hint of a British
withdrawal would activate a loyalist campaign of terror.
Mr Terry Robson, a teacher at the University of Ulster, was not alone in
strident criticism of the two governments. He dismissed the joint
declaration, claiming neither party to it had any intention of responding to
the demands for national self-determination.
As the contributions continued, preparations outside were underway for
tomorrow's demonstration, in which thousands will retrace the 1972 march.
Yesterday, the families of those killed more than two decades ago called on
Mr John Major for a new public inquiry.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Gummer council order unlawful, says court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's review of local authorities in England was seriously
damaged yesterday after the High Court ruled that Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier
structure of county and district councils to be abandoned in all but
'exceptional' circumstances.
Two-tier local government now seems likely to remain intact in most of rural
England, outside counties such as Avon and Cleveland, created by the last
reorganisation in 1974.
But the Department of the Environment said it intended to continue with the
review, which aims to produce plans for restructuring all non-metropolitan
England by the end of this year. The new authorities are set to start in
April 1996.
The decision came as opposition to the Local Government Commission's reforms
built up rapidly among Conservative MPs, especially in the Yorkshire region
and the West Country. Sir Marcus Fox, MP for Selby and chairman of the 1922
committee of Conservative MPs, said backbenchers were 'generally very
concerned'.
Mr David Rendel, Liberal Democrat local government spokesman, called for the
government to abandon the review. 'This farce has gone on long enough,' he
said. 'Local government does need reform, but not in this way.'
The High Court judgment followed an appeal by Lancashire and Derbyshire
county councils against guidance Mr Gummer gave to the commission last
September. This said: 'In some areas the commission may wish to recommend a
continuation of the existing two-tier structure. But the government expects
that to be the exception, and the result will be a substantial increase in
the number of unitary authorities in both urban and rural areas.'
The court said Mr Gummer exceeded his powers in saying this, because the
legislation, introduced in 1992 when Mr Michael Heseltine was environment
secretary, had instructed the commission to find out whether public opinion
in an area favoured reform before making recommendations. It stated no
preference between unitary and two-tier councils.
Mr Gummer may appeal against the ruling.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, had already attacked the
guidance, saying ministers had been 'pushed into a position where they are
predicting the outcome of the review'. He added that there was nothing to
stop the commission recommending the status quo for many more English
counties, if this was supported by public opinion.
They could 'opt in' to the review at a later stage, via a petition of
residents, once other unitary authorities had been established. But this
proposal was rejected by Mr John Major, the prime minister, last July.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Independent bidders told to improve their offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The potential saviours of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday are
being told that they will have to pay more or make their offers more
attractive to shareholders.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, the newspaper group
holding company, and the non-executive directors have reviewed the bid,
offer and proposal that have been submitted and found them all wanting.
Mr Hay Davison believes an auction is under way, although there are a range
of complex issues involved.
The proposal from the consortium which groups the two main existing
shareholders - El Pas and La Repubblica, the founders, led by Mr Andreas
Whittam Smith, and Mirror Group Newspapers - is now being treated as a
formal bid. The offer, which would see MGN take a 40 per cent stake, is
pitched at between Pounds 2.40 and Pounds 2.80 a share. The board committee
has indicated that the bid does not place an adequate value on the company
and it is asking for more.
The offer from Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland, which
would put Pounds 21m of new money in the form of convertible shares worth
Pounds 3 a share, giving Mr O'Reilly just under 25 per cent, is seen to be
attractive. A flaw is the accompanying offer for only up to 20 per cent of
the existing shares at Pounds 2.50. Institutions hold 52 per cent and those
holding more than 20 per cent would probably want to sell. Mr O'Reilly is
being pointed in the direction of a larger, more extended offer, possibly
with a partner.
Mr Conrad Black of the Telegraph Group is waiting in the background. The
Telegraph earlier put forward a proposal which remains on the table. The
deal would essentially take out the institutional shareholders who want to
sell their shares and provide some 'topping up' money for the future of the
paper.
Apart from being able to print The Independent, the Telegraph would manage
the business, apart from editorial, and offer a joint ratecard for
advertising.
The Telegraph is not pushing hard on the issue. Mr Dan Colson,
vice-chairman, said last night: 'They know where we are. They know what the
proposal is. The next move is up to them.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / WDA to shed 17% of staff in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The troubled Welsh Development Agency is to be decentralised with three new
regional divisions and the loss of about 70 of its 420 jobs.
The new structure was unveiled yesterday as the Labour party questioned the
political impartiality of the agency's chairman and called on him to resign.
The WDA's regional staff will be increased by 40 per cent to give stronger
support to Welsh companies and to speed up urban and rural regeneration. The
international division, responsible for inward investment, will also be
reshaped.
'The agency will be slimmer, more effective and certainly in a shape that is
more relevant to the next five years,' Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the chairman,
said yesterday. He expects the changes to make cost savings of Pounds 1m
annually
The demand for Mr Rowe-Beddoe's resignation came from Mr Ron Davies, shadow
Welsh secretary, who said the WDA chief had been chairman of the
Conservatives Abroad Association in Monte Carlo.
Mr Davies said: 'His role raising money and gathering votes for the Tories
from tax exiles is wholly at odds with his job of public service at the
WDA.' Mr Davies said it also called into question the future of Mr John
Redwood as Welsh secretary. 'It strains credibility for John Redwood to call
as he did in the summer for higher standards at the WDA, and to apologise to
parliament for past lapses, yet appoint a chairman with strong partisan
ties,' said Mr Davies.
Mr Redwood said last night that Mr Rowe-Beddoe had been appointed because he
was a very talented businessman. Mr Rowe-Beddoe said he had resigned from
the association in Monte Carlo before becoming WDA chairman.
'I believe my appointment was for no political reasons whatsoever,' he
added. 'I've never discussed political affiliations with the secretary of
state either before, or at the time of, or following my appointment. I
certainly believe I was selected as the best man for the job.'
Referring to the highly critical report on the WDA last year by the Commons
public accounts committee, Mr Rowe-Beddoe said the new structure was not a
direct response but was a 'very important fundamental step' in the agency's
reorganisation.
Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, said he was concerned that
'hidden' behind the decentralisation was 'a very substantial measure of
privatisation . . . and a reduction in the capability of the WDA to offer a
comprehensive package'.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Insurers threaten Names over offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers for Lloyd's agents yesterday threatened loss-making Names with long
and expensive court battles if they reject the insurance market's Pounds
900m settlement offer next month.
In a letter to Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the insurance market, errors and omissions (E&amp;O) underwriters at
Lloyd's ruled out additional money, denting Names' hopes of an improved
offer.
Insurers are understood to have agreed to contribute about Pounds 400m to
the deal announced last month. Further funds will come from Lloyd's central
fund - which meets claims when Names cannot meet their obligations - and
voluntary contributions from agents.
'We have assessed the potential liability of the agents when set against the
limited amount of insurance in force,' the E&amp;O underwriters' letter said.
'On this basis we can justify our contribution, but not more. The only way
we can be persuaded is by the courts, and even then funds are limited.'
Insurance funds likely to be available if legal actions are successful 'will
be well short of the Pounds 900m currently on offer', the letter added. Many
agents had inadequate insurance, while others who have more than enough
insurance have very little exposure.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the largest
organisation of loss-making Names, said: 'I can only characterise these
letters as a regrettable attempt to mislead the Names.'
Based on figures supplied by the E&amp;O insurers, the offer document estimated
'cover available for the losses of about Pounds 2,800m' of between Pounds
820m and Pounds 1,085m.
The Gooda Names, whose main legal case is scheduled to begin in April, are
also aiming to sue for losses which are not covered by the offer document.
Successful claims could trigger more than Pounds 200m in extra E&amp;O cover,
said Mr Deeny.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, has written to Names conceding that the
market had been forced to revise its offer terms to some lossmakers as a
result of arithmetical and other errors.
The revision follows the discovery of another set of errors late last year
and subsequent amendments to the offer. It is thought to affect about 2,000
Names, although the amounts of money involved are small and the overall
shape of the deal is not affected.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party, said: 'Names still have no confidence in the methodology.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Plan to mothball 26 City churches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two-thirds of the City of London's famous Anglican churches would cease to
be used for regular worship under recommendations published yesterday.
A City Churches Commission chaired by Lord Templeman, a law lord, concludes
that plans by the Rt Rev David Hope, bishop of London, to make the church's
ministry and mission more effective will not be fulfilled while so many
resources are devoted to a 'fruitless attempt' to maintain all the City
churches as separate entities.
The commission proposes that there should be four parish churches in the
Square Mile. A further eight would remain in active use with full-time
incumbents.
There is, says the report, no demand for a remaining 26 and they would
become 'reserve' churches. Some might be 'locked up and merely maintained
wind and water tight'. Others could be used for ecumenical, philanthropic or
cultural purposes.
The commission recommends that St Ethelburga, destroyed in last year's
Bishopsgate bombing, should not be rebuilt. It says arguments that failure
to rebuild St Ethelburga would constitute a victory for the IRA are
'emotional and fallacious', and that many churches destroyed by war and fire
are not rebuilt.
Previous attempts to rationalise the City churches have failed, but recent
deterioration in the Church of England's finances make it probable that
action will be taken this time.
Under the commission's proposals City clergy would, as incumbents retire, be
appointed on five-year contracts. A new senior post of City dean would be
created.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Forced resignation clouds Scots agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over two weeks before a parliamentary inquiry into the operations of
Scottish Enterprise, the economic development network for central and
southern Scotland, the chief executive of one of its local enterprise
companies has been forced to resign.
Mr Charles Fairley has quit his role at Scottish Enterprise Tayside, the
local enterprise company based in Dundee, over his links with a company
involved in commercial dealings with the Lec.
Recently, Scottish Enterprise - set up in 1991 to replace the Scottish
Development Agency - has faced heavy criticism, particularly over dealings
between Lecs, the employer-led local economic regeneration bodies, and
companies in which the Lecs' non-executive directors are involved.
Although Scottish Enterprise National, the parent body, has found no
evidence of impropriety, these criticisms prompted an inquiry by the Commons
Scottish select committee which will begin next month.
Mr Fairley's resignation concerns an attempt by Scottish Enterprise Tayside
to assist Laser Ecosse, a laser company bought by its management from
Ferranti International. The Lec commissioned another laser specialist,
Medical Laser Technologies, to assess Laser Ecosse's prospects and later
proposed that both the Lec and MLT should take stakes in Laser Ecosse.
Although Mr Fairley is non- executive chairman of MLT and had earlier
disclosed this to the Lec's board, he did not alert them to the conflict of
interest at the time decisions over Laser Ecosse were made.
Late last year Laser Ecosse rejected an investment in it by MLT, and later
the Lec decided independently not to proceed in association with MLT. Laser
Ecosse restarted talks with the Lec excluding both MLT and Mr Fairley.
The Lec board called in Scottish Enterprise National, which employs Mr
Fairley. On Thursday night Scottish Enterprise National announced Mr
Fairley's resignation.
Last night Scottish Enterprise said that the case was the first of the many
it had investigated in which 'procedural irregularities' had been found.
He Mr Fairley is the second chief executive of a Lec to resign. Last August
Mr Paul Pettigrew, chief executive of Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise,
another Lec, left after an investigation into his management.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Autonomy hopes for Bank dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supporters of more autonomy for the Bank of England suffered a setback
yesterday when a Treasury minister told MPs that statutory moves in that
direction were unlikely in the foreseeable future.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the government
was 'agnostic' about the principle of a more independent central bank. But
he said ministers had not decided that greater independence was 'either
impossible or undesirable'. His comments came as a backbench bill to
increase the Bank's independence failed to negotiate its first Commons
hurdle.
The bill - introduced by Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Euro-sceptic Tory MP for
Wolverhampton South West - was in effect killed when time ran out at
Westminster in yesterday's second-reading debate.
Referring to recent changes conferring a bigger role in deciding the timing
of shifts in borrowing rates upon the Bank, Mr Dorrell said the government
had already 'gently embarked' down the path of greater independence.
He emphasised that ministers would adopt a gradualist approach when deciding
whether to move further down this path.
Under current conventions, the chancellor 'fixes the level of interest rates
and the Bank has responsibility for management of the changes'.
Mr Dorrell warned that it was 'dangerous' for people to allow themselves to
believe that any given set of institutional arrangements could be a
'panacea' guaranteeing price stability.
But he rejected the notion that an independent central bank would be
inherently undemocratic.
It was not a question of which set of arrangements was more democratic but
of which set was broadly accepted as having earned legitimacy over a long
period, he argued.
The central question was how people would react to an independent central
bank putting up interest rates.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Revolt cements Mexican parties' electoral accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The peasant uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas has achieved what years
of negotiating between the country's main political parties could not. It
has made the government and the main opposition forces agree the electoral
rules for a presidential election.
The electoral pact between the main parties for the poll in August could be
the most important political reform of the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas.
It marks the first time the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD)
has accepted the electoral system as legitimate and the pact should pave the
way for a credible and peaceful ballot.
The governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has made, on paper,
substantial concessions. It has agreed to pick electoral authorities
acceptable to all parties, to guarantee equal access to the media and to
appoint a prosecutor for electoral fraud. Also, although this is not part of
the agreement, the limit on each party's campaign spending has been cut from
the equivalent of Dollars 210m to Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m).
'This is the beginning of a democratic transition in Mexico,' says Mr Manuel
Camacho Sols, the government's commissioner for peace in Chiapas and former
mayor of Mexico City. With President Salinas, he helped forge the agreement.
Much can still go wrong, and many details of the pact need to be negotiated.
The PRI rank and file, unlikely to be happy about the concessions its
leaders have made, may not comply with the pact's provisions. The PRD would
then quit the agreement, accusing the government of duplicity.
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD presidential candidate, said on Thursday
that the pact was 'an important and positive step.' He admitted to taking a
serious risk in accepting the government proposals.
Mr Camacho is clear about the motivation behind the electoral pact: 'I could
not have resolved Chiapas without this political reform.' One of the
principal demands of the Zapatista guerrilla rebels in the southern state
has been greater democratic participation by all Mexicans.
The pact also has the potential advantage of bringing the PRD into the
political mainstream. Mr Salinas has spent much of his administration trying
to stamp out the PRD - one reason, critics claim, that leftist Zapatista
rebels had to seek extra-political solutions to their conflicts.
The PRD may have seen its popularity climb after the revolt in Chiapas but
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate, remains the
strong favourite to win in August.
The threat of post-electoral violence, however, probably convinced him to
support the inter-party pact and settle differences with Mr Cardenas.
Mr Salinas, before leaving yesterday for the Davos conference in
Switzerland, reiterated at a private breakfast with PRI legislators and
governors that Mr Colosio would be the party candidate. The president was
seeking to dispel rumours that Mr Colosio would be replaced by Mr Camacho.
Mr Salinas said: 'The PRI has a candidate who will bring it a democratic
victory,' according to Mexican press and television.
The latter, who was being pessimistic last weekend about peace in Chiapas,
is now more hopeful. He has reported new communication with the guerrillas.
The government, through offering money and political change in Chiapas, is
moving to address the other main rebel demand - improved living conditions
for the indigenous peoples in the state.
This may still not be enough. Rebel leaders have dropped early demands for
the overthrow of the Salinas government but no-one can be sure that their
followers will be satisfied with what the government is offering.
'The rebels are fighting the same battle we are,' says a government official
familiar with the negotiations. 'They're divided between violent extremists
and those who hope to achieve their goals through the reform of the
political and judicial process.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Brazil tax defeat jolts stabilisation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's economic stabilisation programme has been cast into doubt by the
government's failure to win support for a tax increase required to help
balance this year's budget, reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
A balanced budget is needed for an economic stabilisation programme launched
by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, to tackle inflation of
about 40 per cent a month. The proposed tax increase was relatively small,
and the money can probably be found elsewhere, but the failure has damaged
the credibility of the programme and its architect.
The defeat stemmed from the government's inability to muster a quorum in
Congress on Thursday night, in effect the deadline for several measures to
be adopted this year. The planned tax increase and other measures will now
lapse, costing the government the equivalent of about Dollars 500m (Pounds
334m) in annual revenue.
If Mr Cardoso can present a balanced budget, he plans to introduce a new
inflation index which could gradually become a new currency linked to the US
dollar or a basket of currencies.
To try and balance the budget, the government is likely next month to start
negotiating alternative measures. It may propose a reduction in export
incentives and further cuts in development programmes. Also, public
servants' income tax may go to the federal government rather than to the
states.

Zambia recorded its first budget surplus last year, Mr Ronald Penza, finance
minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
Presenting the government's budget for 1994, Mr Penza estimated a deficit of
11bn kwacha (Pounds 11.2m), which he said would be covered by non-bank
borrowing.
The 1993 surplus was of K19bn. Real gross domestic product for 1993, lifted
by good farm output, rose by 4 per cent, compared with a contraction of 2.8
per cent in 1992.
Crop production was up about 175 per cent last year but this was offset by
poor performances in mining, manufacturing, construction and energy. Exports
were worth Dollars 950m in 1993, Dollars 24m less than imports. Exports of
copper, Zambia's main foreign exchange earner, dropped 2.2 per cent to
400,000 tonnes.
Mr Penza boosted the 1994 defence budget to K26bn, from K18bn in 1993.

<TEXT>
China has issued its most pointed warning that the continuing row over Hong
Kong threatens commercial relations with Britain.
Miss Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, told reporters yesterday:
'Britain's unfriendly and unco-operative attitude in Hong Kong will
certainly affect normal trade.'
Her remarks were less equivocal than other official statements on the
subject, and indicate that China may be preparing to increase commercial
pressures on Britain.
The minister added it was not China's wish that business relations
deteriorate. 'This is not what we want to see. It is not the responsibility
of the Chinese side.'
British businessmen in Beijing say they are nervous about possible fall-out
from the continuing bitter argument over the democracy plans for Hong Kong
by the governor there, Mr Chris Patten. So far, though, there have been few
conspicuous examples of discrimination against UK companies.
One exception was the failure of British companies in a consortium led by
GEC-Alsthom to win a share of the first stage of the Guangzhou metro. The
contract went to Siemens of Germany.
Mr Zhu Senlin, Guangdong's governor, said then: 'Political and economic
co-operation between China and Britain cannot be separated.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Seven Thai policemen were charged yesterday with operating a scheme that
involved the murder of at least nine Chinese tourists from Hong Kong, China
and Taiwan.
Police captain Prayong Chuphan and his six low-ranking accomplices said they
had prowled the streets of Bangkok last year looking for likely victims to
lure into the countryside where they were beaten, robbed and - in many cases
 -shot.
Acting national police chief Pratin Santiprapob said: 'As many as 40
foreigners went missing about this time. We are afraid there will be more
bodies. They picked on Chinese because they normally have gold ornaments
like necklaces and Rolexes. Chinese often like to gamble, so they carry a
lot of cash.'
The case further darkens the Thai police's reputation for bribery, links to
prostitution and extortion of cash from motorists. It coincides with a
current upsurge in Asian arrivals which is helping to compensate Thailand's
important tourist industry for a decline in arrivals from Europe and North
America.
A Chulalongkorn University study last year claimed that up to 80 per cent of
Thai junior policemen are corrupt and that commissioned officers have to pay
up to the equivalent of Pounds 8,000 for posts in areas of 'widespread
illegal activity'.

<TEXT>
Right-wing groups in South Africa have summoned their supporters to meet
this weekend to decide between peace and resistance to majority rule, with
the gatherings expected crucially to affect South Africa's nascent
democracy.
It was not clear last night whether the white right Afrikaner Volksfront
(Afrikaner People's Front) or the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party could
take a final decision on whether to participate in all-race elections in
late-April and implicitly to accept a constitution which they believe denies
self-determination to the Zulu and Afrikaner peoples.
Both may seek to avoid a final decision, rather than pre-empt talks, due to
resume on Monday, with the African National Congress and the government on
self-determination and regional autonomy. But officials from both groups,
which are due to hold large separate meetings, said negotiations had reached
the 'end of the road' and resistance campaigns were likely to be launched,
at the weekend or later.
Negotiators from all three blocs were privately despondent that agreement
had proved elusive, despite several extensions of the deadline for agreeing
amendments to a new constitution before the April election date is
proclaimed. A proclamation is now expected to be made next week.
Each group is eager to ensure it is not blamed for the failure of talks, and
the weekend meetings could see the right offering publicly to participate in
elections, but under conditions they know the ANC and the government would
find impossible to accept.
Those close to the Afrikaner Volksfront said they had reached agreement with
the ANC to set up a homeland for Afrikaners, who would be represented in the
national parliament in a third chamber, additional to the national assembly
and the senate. However, the government had refused this deal.

Losses made by Codelco, Chile's state copper company, on the London Metal
Exchange could rise to Dollars 165m (Pounds 109m), a senior Codelco
executive admitted yesterday. Original estimates, revealed on Wednesday, had
been in the range of Dollars 100m, reports David Pilling in Santiago.
The Chilean Supreme Court, in response to a call from President Patricio
Aylwin, has appointed a special judge to investigate losses at Codelco, the
world's biggest copper company. The mining commission of the federal Chamber
of Deputies, accountants Price Waterhouse and Codelco itself will run
parallel investigations.
They will be trying to discover how strict controls on futures and options
trading were circumvented by one Codelco trader who is said to have kept his
rising losses secret for four months. Three Codelco executives resigned this
week.
President Aylwin, who did not rule out the possibility of further
resignations, said it had come as a 'surprise' to him to learn that Codelco
took part in futures transactions. 'It strikes me as a delicate matter in a
state company,' he said.
The National Federation of Copper Workers called for all top Codelco
executives to resign, contrasting losses on the futures market with the
management's continual insistence on cost-cutting measures.

Japanese unemployment is continuing to creep up, and industrial output has

yesterday in the latest batch of economic figures.
Industrial production fell by 1.7 per cent from November to December, less
than most economists had forecast. That was the 27th consecutive monthly
fall in output, Japan's longest losing streak, giving a 4.5 per cent decline
for the calendar year. But manufacturers think output might rise slightly
this month and next, said a Ministry of International Trade and Industry
survey .
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose by 0.1 per cent from November to 2.9
per cent last month, a 6 1/2 -year high, said the government's management
and co-ordination agency.
There were 65 jobs available for every 100 seekers in December, unchanged on
the previous month, and close to the 64:100 average in the 10 years to 1986,
the year the late-1980s boom began.
The number of people in work rose slightly last month, by 0.2 per cent from
December 1992, to 64.32m. 'A rise in employment is standard for the early
stage of a recovery,' said Mr Robert Feldman, director of economic research
at Salomon Brothers Asia.
Even so, he was sceptical about Japan's recovery prospects, in that a series
of encouraging economic indicators early last year had heralded a deepening
of the recession.
Japanese inflation continued to ease last year - another symptom of the
weakness of economic activity. Consumer prices rose 1.3 per cent in 1993,
compared with 1.6 per cent in the previous year, said the agency.
The inflation rate in Tokyo, available earlier than the national figures,
was 1.4 per cent in January, 0.1 percentage points higher than in the
previous month. However, the underlying Tokyo rate was unchanged if fresh
food prices, which are volatile, are removed.

FT  29 JAN 94 / London denies China claims of secret HK airport finance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain yesterday denied a Chinese accusation that it had breached a secret
agreement on the financing of Hong Kong's new airport and its connecting
railway, as the diplomatic row over the colony deepened.
The Chinese government chose Sir SY Chung, a former senior member of the
Hong Kong government who is now advising Beijing, to pass on its allegation
that a secret deal had been brokered in 1991 by Sir Percy Cradock, then
foreign affairs adviser to Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Sir SY Chung said in Beijing that Mr Lu Ping, head of the Chinese
government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, had been told by Sir Percy
that an agreed HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 434m) ceiling on Hong Kong government
borrowing for the airport project included debt of the airport and rail
authorities.
Britain was forced to enlist the support of Sir Percy, now one of the
fiercest critics of UK policy on Hong Kong, in denying Mr Lu's contention.
Sir Percy, now retired, negotiated agreements with Beijing over Hong Kong's
return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
'There were no secret understandings between the British and Chinese
governments on airport financing,' the Foreign Office said.
A dispute over financing threatens to delay completion of a new airport,
though Mr Major went to Beijing in September 1991 to sign a memorandum of
understanding meant to secure Beijing's blessing for it.
China has since refused to agree how much debt can be used to finance the
airport and its railway. It says proposals now on the table represent a
financial burden to the post-1997 Hong Kong government.
A clause in the memorandum stipulated that the Hong Kong government's
airport-related debt at June 30 1997 - the last day of British rule - should
not exceed HKDollars 5bn without China's agreement.
The Foreign Office said: 'This clause refers only to borrowings by the Hong
Kong government, not borrowings by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and
the Provisional Airport Authority.' In Sir Percy's negotiations, there had
been no discussion about extending the scope of the ceiling to cover the
MTRC and PAA. It had contacted Sir Percy and he 'agrees with this
description of the position'.
Sir Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, said that throughout
the negotiations the issue of public corporation borrowing had been kept
separate from government borrowing. 'There can be no doubt that borrowings
by the PAA and MTRC are outside the HKDollars 5bn figure,' he said.
Discussions on the airport and other aspects of the 1997 handover have
ground to a halt following the breakdown of Sino-British talks on Hong
Kong's political structure.
However, Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, said that when the
Sino-British airport committee could meet 'we will be putting a new offer
which we think will address all the Chinese concerns.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Nigerian government to control allocations of foreign
exhange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military government is to allocate all foreign exchange directly
to importers, in a move which will tighten state control on the economy and
further alienate its international creditors, with whom the country has debt
arrears of about Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn).
The Paris Club of official creditors, which are owed more than half
Nigeria's Dollars 28bn external debt, are awaiting the outcome of an
International Monetary Fund visit to Nigeria which ends next week before
starting to reschedule the debt for the fourth time. The budget forecast
additional arrears of about Dollars 2.5bn in 1994.
The fund has urged deregulation, but management of the foreign exchange
market has been one of the main obstacles to agreement between Nigeria and
the IMF, which is a pre-condition of external debt relief and fresh credit.
The new system is a setback for Mr KI Kalu, finance minister, and Mr Paul
Ogwuma, central bank governor, whose free-market policies have been
overruled by the rest of the government's economic committee, chaired by Mr
Lateef Jakande, minister of works.
The guidelines issued yesterday in effect return Nigeria to the import
licensing system which became notorious in the 1980s for the corruption it
encouraged in ministers and senior civil servants.
All foreign exchange earned by both private and public sector exporters will
have to be sold, at the fixed rate of 22 naira to the US dollar, to the
Central Bank of Nigeria, which will make direct allocation of foreign
currency to 'importers/end-users'. Eighty per cent of the currency is set
aside for manufacturing industry and agriculture, but the individual
allocations will be made by the cabinet's economic committee.
'It is a return to import licensing by another name,' said a banker in Lagos
last night. 'In some ways, it is a relief because now the government is
completely responsible for the foreign exchange system so, when it goes
wrong, they will have no-one else to blame.'
During various experiments with deregulation in the past eight years,
Nigeria had increased the role of the banks in the foreign exchange market
but never completely relinquished control, especially of the exchange rate.
From now on, the banks will be agents of the central bank, there will be no
facility to sell dollars earned by exporters at competitive exchange rates,
the parallel market will be illegal and bureaux de change will only be
allowed to buy foreign currency at a fixed rate and pass it on to the
central bank.
Some manufacturers argued, before the budget presented this month, for a
guaranteed supply of foreign exchange at a stable rate, but the exchange
rules have already slowed exports and inward investment. This will further
depress Nigeria's balance of payments.

Romania's trade unions said last night more than 1m workers took part in
yesterday's one-hour warning strike, the biggest union action since the end
of communist rule in 1989, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Alfa Cartel, CNSLR-Fratia and the National Union Bloc, which together
represent more than 5m workers, half the workforce, said they would launch
one-day warning strikes in the next 10 days, to be followed by a general
strike, if their demands for faster economic reforms, higher wages and a
better social security system were not met.
The high turn-out and threat of further action will increase pressure on the
ruling Party of Social Democracy in Romania, which this week began new
negotiations for a governing coalition with former communist and hardline
nationalist parties.
The three union blocs have said they will only support a government which
includes pro-reform opposition parties.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Monetary union 'should be delayed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union should be delayed
for 10 years, Mr Uwe Jens, economic policy spokesman for Germany's
opposition Social Democrat party, said yesterday.
During a visit to London, Mr Jens said the 1999 target date for Emu should
be extended by 10 years, since Germany and other EU members were not able to
fulfil the economic criteria for membership of a currency union.
According to opinion polls, the SPD stands a good chance of taking power or
sharing it in a coalition with the ruling Christian Democrats after
Germany's elections in October.
Although Mr Jens stressed his remarks were not official SPD policy, they
will strengthen the impression that Emu has slipped well down the political
priorities of both leading German parties.
Mr Jens said he wanted all 12 members of the European Union to join Emu
simultaneously, as Europe could 'split up' if a small group went ahead
first.

FT  29 JAN 94 / US growth at 5.9% in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's hopes of fostering US economic renewal were boosted
yesterday by official figures showing gross domestic product expanded at an
annual rate of 5.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year - the fastest
quarterly growth since 1987.
Real GDP grew by 2.9 per cent during 1993 as a whole against 2.6 per cent in
1992, confirming the US economy is forging ahead while many trading partners
remained mired in recession.
'You can't get much more solid and steady growth than that,' said Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, Treasury secretary, referring to the accelerating pace of recovery
last year. The fourth-quarter surge reflected strong increases in business
investment, residential housing and spending on durable consumer goods -
sectors that have benefited from the sharp fall in long-term interest rates.
GDP grew at annual rates of 1.9 and 2.9 per cent in the second and third
quarters.
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 19.13 at 3,945.43
a record.
Bond prices also rose sharply despite the evidence of faster growth, because
the GDP report indicated little upward pressure on inflation. The GDP
fixed-weight deflator (the broadest measure of inflation) rose at an annual
rate of 2.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, less than expected.
Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York, said
financial markets were beginning to realise that faster growth did not
entail higher inflation.
Administration officials are also increasingly confident about the prospects
for non-inflationary growth. Output is expected to be artificially depressed
early this year by arctic weather and the Los Angeles earthquake, but the
underlying pace of growth is seen as at least 3 per cent.
The composition of growth is more encouraging than at the end of 1992 when a
similar surge in GDP proved short- lived. This time growth was led by
business fixed investment, which grew at an annual rate of 21 per cent,
easily outstripping consumer spending which expanded at an annual rate of 4
per cent.
Companies were also careful to keep inventories lean, preventing an overhang
of stocks that could have curbed growth this year.
In addition to rapid growth and low inflation, the White House is taking
credit for a sharp improvement in budgetary trends, highlighted by President
Bill Clinton in his State of the Union address. The independent
Congressional Budget Office predicted the deficit would fall to Dollars
223bn (Pounds 148.6bn) this fiscal year and Dollars 166bn by fiscal 1996,
before rising later in the decade.
Mr Bentsen has urged Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents, who
meet next week to discuss monetary policy, to take the tighter fiscal stance
into account when setting interest rates. Most Wall Street analysts,
however, still expect the Fed to nudge short-term rates higher in the next
few months as a sign of its determination to prevent economic recovery
eventually leading to higher inflation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European citizens and businesses should report any complaints about the
year-old single European market to the European Commission, officials said
yesterday.
They said they were satisfied with the progress of the single market
project, in spite of certain teething troubles. The Commission estimates
that the implementation of the market has added 0.4 per cent to annual
economic growth in the European Union since the project was set in train in
1986.
They pointed out that recent criticism from business and consumers was not
reflected in complaints to the Commission, which is supposed to enforce the
aims of free movement of people, capital, goods and services.
Mr John Mogg, the senior Commission official responsible for the internal
market, said yesterday Brussels would not be soft on infringements of the
market's rules, but it could not act on unsubstantiated reports.
'We are not complacent, but we have to know what is going on. We have had a
very low level of complaints, which we have dealt with either legally or
with the appropriate directive, but if we don't hear about problems we don't
know about problems,' he said.
Mr Mogg admitted there were certain gaps in the market, particularly in the
central objective of abolishing passport checks at internal borders, which
has still not been achieved more than a year after the single market
'deadline' of January 1 1993.
But he also hit back at reports of companies' dissatisfaction with the
year-old system of collecting and monitoring value added tax. Mr Mogg cast
doubt on the depth of one recent survey by KPMG, the UK accountants, which
pointed to British exporters' dissatisfaction with the market.

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist, has carved out a vision of
Europe that resembles the continent's brutal reshaping early in the second
world war.
Mr Zhirinovsky drew a map for a retired Swedish ambassador, Mr Rolf Gauffin,
who came to see him in Moscow and subsequently passed it to Le Monde, which
published the map yesterday.
As the newspaper commented, Mr Zhirinovsky's doodlings cannot be entirely
dismissed as 'the imaginings of a crank' because of his success in winning a
quarter of the vote in Russia's elections.
In Mr Zhirinovsky's vision, Russia would regain the Baltic states, except
for the Estonian capital of Tallinn and the inter-war Lithuanian capital of
Kaunas, which would become little city-states.
Germany would repeat its 1938 and 1939 acquisitions of Austria and the Czech
lands, annex bits of western Poland and regain the city of Konigsberg
(today's Russian enclave of Kaliningrad), while Russia would get some of
eastern Poland. Mr Zhirinovsky would take Lvov from Ukraine and return it to
Poland, which lost it as a result of the 1945 Yalta conference. Mr
Zhirinovsky's Russia would take Slovakia.
Further south, Hungary would take Transylvania from Romania, while a greater
Bulgaria would include chunks of Greece, the European part of Turkey and the
ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Bosnia would be carved up between Serbs
and Croats.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies operating in Russia expect little change to an already
difficult investment climate, with many pointing out that conditions for
investing or selling their goods and services had begun to deteriorate even
before Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, announced 'corrections'
to the government's market reforms last week.
Mr Max Dajnowicz, representative for General Motors, said the government's
year-end increases in import tariffs had killed off legal car imports,
encouraging an influx of unsafe, stolen cars and reducing tax revenues.
'It's not clear who is protecting whom here,' he said.
A western telecommunications executive, who asked not to be named for fear
of hurting his company's relations with the authorities, said various
ministries were violating a presidential decree issued last autumn to
protect foreign investment.
'The ministries are reimposing monopolies and altering the terms of the
licences on which companies based their decisions to come here,' he said. He
pointed to the ministries for telecommunications, agriculture and oil as
examples.
Mr Byron Ratliff, the oil expert at Price Waterhouse in Moscow, agreed that
constant changes in tax, legislation for joint ventures and never-ending
negotiations over bigger deals in 1993 meant that oil companies expected
similarly poor treatment this year.
Even when pro-western reformers at the top had proclaimed a desire for
foreign investment, it had been blocked at lower level by officials
reluctant to share the country's biggest export earner with foreign
investors.
He said the new government had decided to 'listen to the election results'
last month in which communists and ultra-nationalists were successful.
Despite the 'one bright spot' of a new law allowing production-sharing,
which offered potentially more secure revenues for western companies than
joint ventures, he believed significant investment by oil companies would be
possible only when the country really wanted it. 'I think (western oil)
people are just waiting for some unforeseen event which will say, 'Yes,
foreign investment is required and welcome'.'
Some were optimistic in so far as they said matters could not get worse.
'If you consider what has happened over the past three years, this is just
another blip on the screen,' said Mr David Geovanis, director of
Ducat-Liggett, a joint venture which produces cigarettes and develops
property. During three tumultuous years, which have seen the collapse of the
Soviet Union and two failed coups, his company has managed to overcome
difficulties including a protracted dispute with the workforce of a Moscow
cigarette factory it has since invested in.
'There is an entrepreneurial drive in this country which moves ahead
regardless of what happens,' he said.
A few bankers even expressed hopes of an improvement. The bankers have
little reason to miss the radical reformers, who failed to reschedule
Russia's commercial debts on terms desired by western banks and supported
Russian banks' demands for protection against the western competition.
'They were the ones who cut back the terms of our banking licences,' said
one who declined to be identified, referring to a presidential decree
restricting the terms of licences given out by the central bank.
Mr Dominique Menu, the representative of Banque Nationale de Paris, said
there was hope 'for some discipline' if Mr Chernomyrdin displayed as prime
minister the ability and strength he had demonstrated as head of Gasprom,
the country's gas monopoly. Whatever happened, he faced an extremely
difficult task in trying to keep industry afloat, while keeping a grip on
spending.
'It's like riding a bicycle,' he said. 'You have to keep moving so the
bicycle does not fall over, while being able to control it at a downhill
speed. Now we're going to see if Mr Chernomyrdin can ride a bicycle in these
conditions.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has warned that Greece's Socialist government will
be obliged to introduce new taxes this year, to prevent the public sector
deficit running out of control.
In its latest report on the Greek economy, the Commission predicts that, on
the basis of current fiscal trends, revenues will increase by only 15 per
cent in 1994, against a budget target of 22.9 per cent.
The report says measures to raise extra revenue, equivalent to 5.5 per cent
of gross domestic product, will be needed to limit the central government
borrowing requirement to 12.9 per cent of GDP, the budget target.
However, if the government is required to raise extra funds to cover a
larger-than-forecast public sector wage bill, increased interest payments
could send the borrowing requirement soaring to 18 per cent of GDP, the
report adds.
After several years of real wage decreases, the government is being pressed
to grant generous rises to workers in state-controlled banks and public
corporations. Moves to rehire public sector workers dismissed under the
previous government's cost-cutting programme are under way.
Greece's public debt, at 154 per cent of GDP the highest in the European
Union, is poised to rise again this year as a result of heavy losses posted
in 1993 by state corporations.
The Greek parliament voted yesterday to investigate allegations that former
conservative prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis was involved in illegal
wiretapping of political rivals, Reuter reports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called
for a review of policy to help speed the political and economic integration
of central and eastern Europe.
The review follows a message from US President Bill Clinton that the
European Union must do more to help the former communist countries. But it
also anticipates renewed pressure from the east Europeans for closer ties
and eventual EU membership following the anti-reformist, nationalist
backlash in Russia.
The Commission study will cover technical aid, foreign policy co-operation,
and the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy in relation to eastern
and central Europe. It is also likely to examine the prospects for new
security links, including possible associate membership of the Western
European Union.
Mr Delors said in his annual address to reporters in Brussels yesterday that
it was time to think of a 'Greater Europe'. It was not enough to admit four
new members (Sweden, Austria, Finland, and Norway), send a friendly signal
to Cyprus and Malta, and offer encouraging words to eastern Europe. 'Europe
needs to know where it is going,' he said. Mr Delors also indicated that
thinking about a new European architecture would inevitably re-open
sensitive questions about the institutional balance, including the weight of
voting between small and large countries.
At the Copenhagen summit in June 1993, the Twelve told the east Europeans
they would be able to join the Union, but did not offer a firm timetable.
They also pledged more formal political ties and greater market access. In
the past six months, attention in Brussels has been diverted by events in
Russia and a failed drive to conclude a new partnership and co-operation
agreement with Moscow.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Sutherland urges new global forum

Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday called on world leaders to establish a new high-level
forum for international economic co-operation, with members drawn from
developing and former communist countries as well as the industrialised
nations.
Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Sutherland
said new co-operative structures were needed to deal effectively with global
economic issues and problems. Existing mechanisms were not up to the job.
For example, the Group of Seven rich industrialised nations 'self-evidently
excludes most of the world's population and a large number of the world's
substantial and fast-growing economies'. Mr Sutherland was also critical of
the lack of co-ordination among the various international institutions, for
instance in dealing with Russia's difficulties.
The successful completion last December of the Uruguay Round of global trade
talks, if fully exploited, 'should mean nothing less than a new start for
sustainable growth and a new system of collective economic security for the
world', Mr Sutherland said.
It had also shown that economies were 'too mutually interdependent to reach
their full potential in isolation or at cross purposes'.
World leaders should follow through the logic of the round to put in place
new co-operative structures that would recognise the realities of the next
century. 'We cannot continue with the majority of the world's people
excluded from participation in global economic management,' he said.
The G7 summits have come in for increasing criticism in recent years as
irrelevant and ineffective, partly because of their restricted membership
and partly because of inadequate institutional support.
Mr Sutherland's proposed alternative would bring a wider range of countries
together at prime ministerial and trade and finance minister level, with
institutional support coming from the IMF, World Bank and the future World
Trade Organisation which will supersede Gatt next year.

FT  29 JAN 94 / UK halts Bosnia aid after worker killed

Britain yesterday suspended all official aid convoys throughout the former
Yugoslavia after gunmen, believed to be Moslems, shot dead a British aid
worker and wounded two others as they tried to escape, in the central
Bosnian town of Zenica.
Only hours after the incident, three journalists working for Italian state
television were killed in fighting in the south-western Bosnian town of
Mostar, which is under siege by Bosnian Croat irregular troops.
The Italian Foreign Ministry said the three - a reporter, a cameraman and a
sound technician for the state broadcasting organisation RAI - were killed
during a mortar attack in the Moslem-held eastern part of the town.
The British aid workers, employees of the Overseas Development
Administration, were abducted in Moslem-controlled Zenica by a group of
uniformed men with assault rifles, according to Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman
for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
'The way it was described to us in the first report (by the two survivors)
was that it was a gang, an armed gang,' she said. 'I don't think this is the
policy of any government to do something like this.'
After being seized in their Range Rover outside the European Union's relief
warehouse in Zenica, the Britons were driven out of town and ordered out of
their vehicle. The 'bandits' beat them and robbed them.
One of the Britons, Mr Paul Goodall, was shot dead immediately while the
other two ran away towards a river. Both of them were shot and wounded, but
managed to escape.
Mr Goodall was the 11th aid worker to be killed in the former Yugoslavia.
The UNHCR is also considering whether to suspend its aid operations in the
area, as it did for a month after an aid convoy driver was shot dead in
October, according to the organisation's spokesman in Sarajevo, Mr Ron
Redmond.
'What we have now is people attacking their own military as well as our own
(UN) people. We're extremely concerned about that, and obviously if this
kind of thing continues, we are not going to be able to operate,' Mr Redmond
said.

Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International yesterday confirmed that it was
involved with Polsat, the consortium which has won the licence for Poland's
first national commercial television channel.
The company said there had been detailed discussions but no final decisions
had been taken and the Murdoch organisation was not legally a member of the
consortium.
It is believed that News International, the UK subsidiary of News
Corporation, signed a letter of intent with Polsat to take a stake of up to
33 per cent. News International declined to comment on this yesterday.
Earlier, a spokesman had said: 'News has had several discussions with Polsat
about finding ways in which News might contribute to the consortium, such as
the provision of programming, but no final decision regarding any
involvement has been made.'
Mr Zygmunt Solorz, the owner of Polsat, yesterday denied he had any
agreements with News International. 'We parted with Mr Murdoch when we made
our application for the licence last November,' said Mr Solorz yesterday. He
added that he recently passed a letter dated January 25 from News
International to the Radio and Television Council, which issued the licence,
in which the international media group said it wanted to participate in the
Polsat application.
The letter came after three days of public hearings earlier this month
during which Polsat had taken the line, with considerable success, that it
represented a purely Polish bid with no foreign links. It won the licence
against competition from mixed local and foreign groups. Mr Solorz said
yesterday that he had 'no contracts, no agreements with anyone' but he added
that he was now receiving offers of co-operation from other foreign
companies such as Time Warner.
It appears that Polsat will have to gain the council's approval if it wants
to bring in a foreign partner, although the law permits up to 33 per cent
foreign ownership.
Mr Solorz wrote yesterday to Mr Marek Markiewicz, chairman of the National
Broadcasting Council, insisting that Polsat had no contractual obligations
to any foreign interests.
He said he also denied rumours about 'alleged negotiations in London at our
representatives with News Corporation. All the documents pertaining to our
contractor with foreign interests have been presented to the National
Broadcasting Council.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Minister sacked amid bank sale row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stefan Kawalec, the deputy finance minister responsible for privatising
Poland's banking sector, has been sacked by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime
minister, after an outcry over the pricing of a bank privatisation.
Shares in the Bank Slaski, which were offered to the public at 500,000 zloty
in November, soared to 6.7m zloty when traded on the Warsaw stock exchange
last week. Mr Kawalec, who was respected by local and foreign bankers, had
been in charge of negotiations with ING bank of the Netherlands, which
bought 29.5 per cent of Bank Slaski at the public offer price.
Mr Kawalec came under fire last week from deputies in the PSL farmers'
party, Mr Pawlak's own grouping, who charged that the bank had been sold too
cheaply. The dismissal came in spite of the fact that Mr Marek Borowski, the
deputy premier in charge of the economy, on Thursday took responsibility for
the pricing decision.
So far Poland has seen the privatisation of two big state banks. A third
disposal, of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy, is planned for the
middle of the year. The government had been planning to sell off six more
banks by the end of 1996.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Mayhew hopeful of positive Sinn Fein response on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An upbeat assessment of the Ulster peace process came yesterday from Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, following talks in Dublin
with the Irish government.
After the first Anglo-Irish conference since December's Downing Street
Declaration, he said there was 'a rational ground for being hopeful' that
there would be a positive response by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
The British and Irish governments have agreed to give Sinn Fein more time to
consider their joint peace initiative. In the meantime, however, they will
press ahead 'as a matter of urgency' with efforts to restart round-table
talks between the province's constitutional parties.
Hours after Sir Patrick's remarks, Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams said
he was prepared to go 'the extra mile' for peace. 'I am willing to seek to
persuade the IRA to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its
campaign,' he said in Belfast. Earlier yesterday the US government in effect
refused Mr Adams a visa to attend a conference on Northern Ireland in New
York on Monday, saying it would only consider lifting its ban on him
entering the country if he renounced violence and embraced the peace
process.
Sir Patrick also hinted at greater flexibility on the British government's
refusal to respond to demands by Sinn Fein for clarification of the
declaration. He said that 'through speeches' both governments would continue
to 'make clear' what the joint declaration offered.
'If there are misapprehensions I will put that right . . . you can call it
clarification if you like.'
He added that he did not dis-agree with any recent speeches on the
declaration made by the Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, or the
foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring. These had been expressly aimed at
clarifying concerns raised by Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick reiterated, however,
that there would be no negotiation or 'unravelling' of the agreement.
The declaration concedes the principle of national self-determination for
the Irish people as a whole, but any new agreement would require majority
consent in Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick's positive tone contrasted with the mood at recent private
briefings for journalists by the Northern Ireland office, and suggests
yesterday's talks have given him reasons for optimism.
Mr Spring, asked if he was privy to information that Sinn Fein was moving
towards an acceptance of the declaration, said: 'I don't think it would be
helpful to go into details.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Major links Tory fortunes to faster economic growth: PM
faces renewed leadership speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night staked his hopes for a revival in the fortunes of
his embattled government on faster economic recovery. He strongly defended
the tax increases at the centre of the latest political storm as 'the tough
decisions today that will make everyone better off tomorrow'.
But at the end of a week which has seen disgruntled Tory MPs again question
his leadership, the prime minister faced fresh difficulties from Mr Norman
Lamont.
The former chancellor, who was sacked last year, is quoted today in The
Times as describing the prime minister as 'weak and hopeless'. Downing
Street was curtly dismissive of the reported attack, saying it was an
attempt to 'rake over cold ashes', and in a statement last night Mr Lamont
said the published interview did not reflect accurately his views or general
attitude.
The government's run of embarrassing mishaps was further compounded
yesterday by a High Court ruling against attempts by Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to restructure local government.
Mr Major was confronted also with growing speculation on the Conservative
backbenches that some cabinet ministers have begun to position themselves
for a possible leadership contest later this year.
In his latest attempt to regain the political initiative, the prime minister
made sustaining the pace of economic recovery his central objective for
1994.
Sidestepping the furore over the moral aspects of his 'back to basics'
initiative, he said the priority was 'getting back to the most basic basics
of all: lower borrowing, lower unemployment, low inflation and more growth'.
In a speech to businessmen at the Leeds Chamber of Commerce, Mr Major said
maintaining growth depended on constant improvements in Britain's
competitiveness. Both public and private sectors had to keep wage costs
down, while the government's education policies were working towards
'nothing less than the re-skilling of Britain'.
With senior ministers acknowledging that the government's fortunes were now
linked with a visible acceleration in economic growth, Mr Major insisted:
'We now have the conditions for long-term sustainable growth.'
He said Britain's 1.9 per cent inflation rate would probably rise slightly
during the next few months but added: 'Low inflation is here to stay. So
industry can now invest with confidence.'
Referring to the impending tax increases in April, Mr Major said that he
would have preferred not to have introduced them: 'It was necessary, because
sound finances are the only basis for sustained economic growth.'
Mr David Richardson, president of the Leeds chamber, attacked the government
in front of Mr Major for 'ill thought-out' proposals on its services to
industry and commerce.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, meanwhile led cabinet ministers in a
series of speeches emphasising Britain was 'leading Europe out of
recession'. He said the Tories would fight June's election to the European
parliament on a platform of prosperity through improved competitiveness.
The consensus among Tory backbenchers yesterday was that Mr Major could ride
out the present storm. But ministers admitted privately that bad results in
local and European elections could threaten his leadership.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Diesel cars bad for health, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing popularity of diesel cars is 'extremely bad for human health',
according to the authors of a government report on air pollution.
The report, published yesterday, vigorously attacks the 'green' image of
diesel and says the engines produce high levels of gases and soot, causing
breathing difficulties and cancer.
'If you want to buy a car that's good for the environment, buy a
petrol-engined car with a catalytic converter,' said Professor Roy Harrison,
a scientist based at Birmingham University and chairman of the group that
produced the report. He believed a new tax on diesel to make it more
expensive than petrol would be 'a good idea'.
The motor industry, which as a producer of both petrol and diesel cars
maintains it has 'no axe to grind', immediately launched a scathing attack
on the report.
It said that in reaching its conclusions the report had failed to take
account of continuing 'enormous progress' in diesel engine technology which
rendered most of the criticisms invalid.
'It is erroneous, misplaced, misguided and fundamentally unsound,' said Mr
Roger King, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' public affairs
director.
The industry fears that uncertainties created by the report may slow
recovery in the new car market. Diesel cars make up only 6 per cent of the
national total, but last year accounted for a fifth of new car sales.
Marketing has portrayed them as cheaper to run and environmentally
'friendly'.
The report, commissioned by the Department of the Environment from the
Quality of Urban Air Review Group, agrees diesel engines are cleaner than
petrol cars. But it says that they produce more nitrogen oxides,
hydrocarbons, carbon particles and black smoke than petrol cars fitted with
catalytic converters.
Diesel cars emit less 'greenhouse' gases than petrol cars, but scientists
say diesel particles may play a role in global warming.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Croat army bolsters fighters in Bosnia: UK suspends official
aid convoys after driver is killed by gunmen

<TEXT>
Thousands of Croatian army troops, backed by tanks and helicopters, have
been pouring into Bosnia to bolster the Bosnian Croat militia in its war
against the Moslems in central Bosnia.
The latest development in the nearly two-year-old Bosnian conflict,
confirmed by highly-placed independent sources, could lead to a dangerous
escalation of the fighting at a time when a peace deal appears as
unattainable as ever. It could also lead to the imposition of international
sanctions on Croatia such as those in effect against Serbia. The Croatian
move coincides with the suspension by Britain of official aid convoys
throughout former Yugoslavia after a British aid driver was shot dead and
his two British companions were wounded in an attack in Zenica, central
Bosnia.
The three men, employed by the Overseas Development Administration, were
hijacked in their vehicle by gunmen wearing military uniforms. Mr John
Major, the prime minister, said he was 'shocked and distressed' by the
attack.
An announcement yesterday by the Bosnian government about the Croatian troop
movements made public what has been an open secret in United Nations and
European Union quarters in Bosnia for the past week.
Calling on the UN Security Council to stop what it described as open
military intervention by Zagreb in the Bosnian conflict, Mr Haris Silajdzic,
the Moslem Bosnian prime minister, said up to 12,000 regular Croatian army
soldiers with tanks and helicopters had moved into Bosnia.
Mr Silajdzic was speaking to reporters after his mainly Moslem cabinet
called for an emergency session of the Security Council to condemn the
Croatian military incursion.
'For about one week now, the intervention has become obvious, almost
undisguised, and we fear escalation in the region of Prozor, Gornji Vakuf
and Jablanica because of the presence and activity of these troops,' he
said.
Mr Silajdzic also claimed that Yugoslav special forces had entered eastern
Bosnia to strengthen Bosnian Serb troops in what appeared to be a
co-ordinated military campaign with Zagreb against the Moslems.
Both the Bosnian Serbs and Croats have become concerned about recent
military successes of the Bosnian Moslems in central Bosnia over the past
few weeks and are worried about a possible Moslem spring offensive.
Michael Littlejohns writes from the United Nations: After much agonising,
the UN has authorised the use of air strikes in self-defence if necessary to
ensure the rotation of 150 Canadian troops out of Srebrenica in eastern
Bosnia.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, issued his authority in a
letter to the Security Council, released last night.

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has issued Fl 155.6m (Dollars 80m) worth of
non-tradeable participation certificates to one of its staff pension funds,
as part of a wider cost-saving deal agreed with its staff last year.
The KLM Flight Personnel Pension Fund yesterday agreed to buy 4.75m profit
participation certificates for a price of Fl 32.78 each, helping to bolster
the airline's balance sheet.
The price per certificate is roughly equivalent to the level at which KLM's
ordinary shares were trading when the deal with employees was struck in
July. KLM's shares have since risen to around Fl 46.00, in spite of the
collapse of merger talks with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System and
Austrian Airlines.
The certificates give the pension fund the right to share in KLM's profit
but they do not carry voting rights nor can they be traded.
KLM is planning to make a rights issue later this year. The government has
already pledged its support.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: MG Corp damage limited by metals
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and engineering group, said
yesterday that it was having more success than it had anticipated in
limiting the damage caused by the speculative deals entered into by MG Corp,
the company's New York-based commodity trading subsidiary.
Metallgesellschaft said the losses from MG Corp's ventures in the US oils
derivatives markets had stabilised at the levels indicated earlier this
month.
MG Corp's risky ventures in the oil futures markets account for the bulk of
the DM3.3bn (Dollars 1.9bn) of past and potential losses which drove the
metals, mining and industrial conglomerate to the brink of bankruptcy. MG
Corp caused a loss of DM800m in the year to last September and is set to
lose a further DM1.5bn this financial year as it unwinds its positions.
The losses, believed to be the biggest suffered by a company as a result of
derivatives trading, arose because of a timing mismatch between MG Corp's
commitment to supply oil to customers in the future and the hedging
strategies used to protect the forward position.
While MG Corp contracted to deliver 170m barrels of oil at up to five years
into the future, it had attempted to cover its position by buying short-term
futures contracts. 'The timing difference killed them when the oil price
fell,' said one banker.
When the oil price fell MG Corp was obliged to meet margin calls - large
cash payouts - with the New York Mercantile Exchange in respect of its
short-term contracts. But it is understood that MG Corp did not require its
own customers to make margin calls, thereby exacerbating its cash flow
crisis.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, is formulating a
strategy for the group's future. Full details are to be revealed on February
22.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's new government will encourage private investment and try to
avoid the errors of past administrations which relied too much on oil
revenues, according to Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, a top adviser to
President-elect Rafael Caldera.
Mr Sosa, addressing around 500 Venezuelan and international businessmen,
gave few details of the policies of the Caldera government, due to be
installed next Wednesday. But he said it would stress austerity, hard work,
private investment, international trade and diversification away from oil.
The new government would continue to encourage privatisation, and would
allow private investment in all government-owned businesses except PDVSA,
the national oil company, and Edelca, the state-owned hydroelectric power
company, he said. However, joint ventures in oil and petrochemicals (which
are controlled by PDVSA) will continue and be supported.
Mr Caldera, who won the presidency in elections last December 5, has called
for the elimination of an unpopular value added tax. Mr Sosa said the
president would propose a coherent tax reform stressing progressive
taxation. He denied the new government was planning a large devaluation of
the Venezuelan bolivar or imposition of exchange controls.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Brazil makes slow progress on economic reform package
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Congress is inching towards approval of the first stage in the
government's economic stabilisation package, but observers remain cautious
about whether the plan will provide a lasting cure for inflation, now
running at about 40 per cent a month.
Congress yesterday looked set to pass a set of measures, including a slight
increase in corporate tax, which are needed to help balance this year's
budget. This marked a partial victory for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the
finance minister, who proposed the package last month. However, more
controversial proposals to reduce the budget deficit have met substantial
opposition and the government is being forced to contemplate alternative
cuts.
Measures approved so far include a 5 per cent increase in existing tax
bands, taking the top rate from 25 per cent to 26.25 per cent, and a new
upper rate of 35 per cent. But Mr Cardoso's plans to raise Dollars 5.6bn by
setting aside 15 per cent of the transfers central government makes to
states and municipalities has been strongly criticised by Brazil's powerful
state governors. The set-aside can only be approved via a constitutional
amendment and now looks likely to be watered down.
As a result, the government is likely next month to start negotiating
alternative measures and may propose a reduction in export incentives and
further cuts in development programmes. It is also possible the estimate of
social security contributions will be increased, despite a previous upwards
readjustment, and that public servants' income tax will go to the federal
rather than state governments.
These measures would allow the government to claim a balanced budget, but
some observers fear the balance will be cosmetic. 'They're making deals and
Congress is proposing substitutes and that suggests something is very
shaky,' according to Mr Robert Macedo, former economic policy secretary.
The plan has also generated some optimism that Brazil can complete a debt
deal with international banks by a deadline of April 15.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, which heads the bank advisory
committee, said he was 'increasingly optimistic' that a deal - which covers
Dollars 35bn of debt principal, Dollars 7bn in interest arrears and about
Dollars 11bn owed to Brazilian banks - could be completed by the deadline.
This will require an accord with Brazil and with the International Monetary
Fund, to be voted at the IMF's March board meeting.
Citibank said the holders of 96.51 per cent of the Dollars 35bn debt
principal have now signed the accord. This suggests the Brazilian holding of
the Dart family of the US - which still object to the terms of the deal - is
just over Dollars 1.22bn, less than once thought.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's governing party and the main opposition yesterday reached their
first pact setting out the conditions for holding federal elections. The
agreement may help reduce political tension following the New Year uprising
in the southern state of Chiapas.
The pact was approved by the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution, which
had previously rejected government proposals for electoral reforms as
insufficient. But it still has to be fleshed out with more concrete
agreements that are subject to negotiation - and may not necessarily be
reached.
Mexico is holding presidential elections next August. While the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party is favourite to win, the party's victories
have been marred by accusations of electoral fraud and vote-rigging.
The pact promises in general terms that electoral authorities will be chosen
according to a consensus of the political parties, gives full access to the
electoral roll to all parties, guarantees fair media coverage of the
campaign, and will allow for a special prosecutor to investigate electoral
fraud.
The government appears to have made significant concessions to the PRD,
although how the accord works remains to be seen. The signatories said the
agreement was a significant step in creating credible and legal elections in
the country.
They said it would contribute to peace in Mexico, in reference to the
Chiapas rebellion. Democratic reforms have been one of the demands of the
Chiapas guerrillas.
The agreement is an attempt by the government's to regain the initiative
after the uprising, and is a response to opposition warnings that there
could be more violence if the elections were not fair.

FT  28 JAN 94 / EIB chief questions need for new bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Investment Bank yesterday cast doubt on the need for new
lending instruments such as 'Union bonds' to fund large rail, road and
telecommunications projects in Europe.
Sir Brian Unwin, EIB president, said the bank had plenty of spare lending
capacity to fund so-called trans-European networks. This would remain the
case for at least the next two years.
Sir Brian was speaking in Brussels where he reported that EIB lending last
year had risen by 15 per cent to Ecu19.6bn (Dollars 21.75bn), compared to
Ecu17bn in 1992. Around Ecu7.8bn was advanced to trans-European networks.
Late last year, the European Commission, acting on the suggestion of Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, produced plans to raise money at
cheap rates to lend on to governments to fund the infrastructure projects.
The plan aroused concern in the UK and Germany which questioned the
suggestion that there was a financing gap.
Under a compromise, the Commission has set up a working party including
senior officials from all member states - as well as Sir Brian - to first
identify 'sensible, viable and economic' projects and then tackle the
financing issue.
In 1993, the EIB channelled Ecu12.5bn to the poorer regions of the Union.
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland attracted 37 per cent of total EIB
lending.
The bank also doubled lending outside the EU in Asia, Latin America, and
central and Eastern Europe to Ecu1.9bn. It is gearing up for a role in the
occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza as well as post-apartheid
South Africa.
However, Sir Brian made clear he has no interest in being drawn into Russia
which was 'a wholly new and difficult area'.
He expressed optimism that the new European Investment Fund designed to help
small and medium-sized businesses would be up and running by April. A
consortium of private banks from all 12 member states is expected to put up
the required 30 per of the EIF share capital shortly; but Spain, Italy and
Luxembourg have yet to ratify amendments to the original statute of the EIB.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Provisions at AT&amp;T and MCI lead to earnings fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US communications and computing group, yesterday reported a slight
dip in fourth quarter net income after special charges, but a 15 per cent
increase in earnings excluding the provisions.
MCI Communications, its smaller rival in the long-distance market, reported
a 33 per cent drop in fourth quarter earnings after special charges, but a
24 per cent increase excluding the provisions.
AT&amp;T made Dollars 982m, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter, after
previously announced restructuring charges at its NCR computer subsidiary
and a non-cash change in accounting methods. This compared with net income
of Dollars 1bn, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues rose
5.5 per cent to Dollars 18.46bn. Excluding the charges, net income was
Dollars 1.15bn, or 85 cents a share.
The company's biggest business, long-distance telecommunications, saw
calling volumes grow more than 6 per cent from the fourth quarter of last
year, helped by the improving US economy. AT&amp;T, which faces fierce
competition in this market from MCI and other rivals, saw long-distance
revenues rise just 2 per cent to Dollars 9.82bn as customers took advantage
of special discount plans. It has been mounting a campaign to boost
international equipment sales.
NCR, which the group is renaming AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, reported
a 20 per cent rise in sales of computer products and equipment, while its
total revenues rose 7 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. Excluding Dollars 190m of
pre-tax restructuring charges, it had operating income of Dollars 61m.
For the full year, excluding accounting and restructuring charges, the group
reported net income of Dollars 4.26bn, or Dollars 3.15 a share, on revenues
of Dollars 67.16bn, compared with income of Dollars 3.81bn, or Dollars 2.86
a share, on revenues of Dollars 64.9bn in 1992.
MCI reported fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 107m, or 18 cents a share,
down from Dollars 160m, or 30 cents, in the same period of last year, after
taking a Dollars 150m realignment charge. Excluding the provision, earnings
rose to Dollars 199m, or 34 cents a share. Revenues rose more than 13 per
cent to Dollars 3.13bn. For the full year, MCI reported earnings excluding
charges of Dollars 731m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, up from Dollars 1.11 a
share in 1992.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): Post script
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was really only one place for the investor to be in the final quarter
of 1993, and that was south-east Asia, especially Hong Kong. A number of
unit trusts in the Far East (excluding Japan) sector have doubled their
money over one year; and over five years the average fund has turned Pounds
1,000 into more than Pounds 4,000 (and Pounds 6,500 in the league-topping
case of Gartmore Hong Kong).
On the other hand, the brilliant growth story of the 1980s, Japan, has
turned into the tale of woe of the 1990s. Tokyo dived in the
October-December quarter, and although the strength of the yen has kept UK
investors' heads above water over 12 months, the average Japan fund is
scarcely showing a profit over the past five years. Many, in fact, are down
over this period: our table of sector leaders is packed with small-company
specialists which have been insulated from the worst of the Tokyo bear
market.
The lesson is that no sector success story continues for ever, and in theory
a more broadly-based international fund could provide a more reliable
long-term performance if only it could be managed skilfully. But it seems to
be better to look for this type of fund in investment trusts, rather than
unit trusts. Investment trusts like Law Debenture, Bankers and the daddy of
them all, Foreign &amp; Colonial, have tripled investors' money over five years
(and the first two have added 50 per cent in a year).
In contrast, the international unit trusts tend to be a fairly unexciting
bunch, apart from the emerging markets specialists which have wound up in
this sector and have clearly boosted the average performance level. It is
hard for unit trust groups to sell general international funds on any scale,
because investors (or the intermediaries who advise them) are looking for
specialist vehicles. So the commercial emphasis for unit trust groups lies
in focusing their management resources on specialist funds.
As for the UK funds, they had a good quarter, but it is worth noting the
appearance of several index-tracking funds in the list of leaders over five
years (the Royal Life UK index is sixth out of 100-odd in the UK General
sector). This is a predictable development now that more and more of the
trackers are passing their fifth birthdays.
Too many unit trust portfolios are expensively churned in order to produce
short-term performance, but hardly any outperform the index in the long run.
Over time, the trackers, which have low costs, are therefore creeping
remorselessly up the league table. By the time they have a 10-year
performance history they could well be clustered at the very top.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Faith and
charity overcome 'guilt' - Serious riches / Elizabeth Breton saw her
inheritance as family money, rather than her own, and knew that it needed to
be managed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greed is good' epitomised the attitude towards making money of a whole
generation of young City dealers. 'Rich is responsible' would more aptly
describe Elizabeth Breton's way of thinking. A landowner and philanthropist,
investment runs in her veins.
Her maternal grandfather, William Mackenzie, a stockbroker, was one of the
founders of the Dundee Stock Exchange. He was also the architect of the
Alliance Trust, the investment trust which today is one of the UK's largest.
The Alliance Trust was formed in 1888 through a series of amalgamations of
Scottish and American mortgage companies. Dundee had always had strong
business connections with the US, but in the 1870s when Americans found it
difficult to pay for goods with cash, Scottish merchants took mortgages over
land in the US as security for goods they sold.
The high interest rates available in parts of the US attracted Scottish
entrepreneurs into establishing trust companies to invest directly in
mortgages.
To lessen risk, the entrepreneurs held firmly to the importance of
diversification, spreading their risks geographically and across a variety
of crops and types of land. This diversification was a guiding principle of
the investment trust movement.
The Dundee Mortgage and Trust Investment company and the Oregan and
Washington Trust company were among those which joined forces to become the
Alliance Trust. Mackenzie, who had been secretary of the Oregan &amp; Washington
Trust, in due course became managing director of Alliance trust.
'My mother was very proud of him; I am proud that the company is still run
from the same offices in Dundee and that he made his money honestly,' says
Mrs Breton, who has a substantial holding in the investment trust company
which her grandfather played an instrumental role in founding.
Her father's family were Lincolnshire farmers, and although he left a
700-acre farm, the principal inheritance was from grandfather Mackenzie. 'I
did not regard the money as my own - I was fairly socialist in those days,
and felt guilty about inherited wealth.'
When her husband was invalided out of the Royal Air Force in 1955, the two
formed a farming partnership and bought 500 acres of arable land in
Gloucestershire; a further 300 acres was added in 1964. Mrs Breton also ran
a holiday cottage business to make use of the unoccupied cottages on the
land.
'Since 1978, I have been involved in a lot of wheeling and dealing. We were
keen to expand into a second farm, and one was bought in Suffolk, financed
by a sale-and-leaseback of part of the home farm. When Suffolk proved too
far away, we relocated to Sussex. In 1987, most of the home farm was sold,
followed by various barns, cottages and land, to maximise assets, with a
view to relocating on better-quality land.'
Land and houses account for almost 40 per cent of her wealth. Because Mrs
Breton wants to buy more farm land, some 35 per cent of her liquid assets
are in the building society. Apart from a tax-exempt special savings account
(Tessa), National Savings products and life assurance, the rest is invested
in the stock market.
'I have always thought of money as something you must be careful with, and,
because I regarded my inheritance as family money and not mine, I felt
responsible for looking after it. In the early 1960s, I realised that my
investments needed to be managed.'
She has relied on the advice of her accountant, Gerry Camamile, and Brian
Tora of Greig Middleton, the City stockbrokers. Tora has managed her stock
market portfolio for the past 20 years on a discretionary basis. He first
took it over after the 1974 stock market crash, until when it had been
invested predominantly in smaller companies, and switched the emphasis to
large blue chips.
The portfolio is still dominated by large companies, with a smattering of
smaller companies. The exposure to overseas markets is obtained through
Fidelity European and the large holding in the Alliance Trust. This is 55
per cent invested in the UK, 25 per cent in North America, 9 per cent in
Europe and 7 per cent in the Far East (nearly all outside Japan), with cash
making up the balance.
Each year, Pounds 6,000 of her Alliance Trust holding is transferred into a
general personal equity plan, to roll up free of income and capital gains
tax. Another Pounds 3,000 is put into a single-company Pep managed by Greig
Middleton, so that the full annual Pep allowance is used up.
Despite her wealth, Mrs Breton lives in a modest stone house in a small
village in Gloucestershire. 'My mother was very much against any kind of
ostentation; she was also very generous.'
One room of the house has been converted into an office, with fax machine
and secretary. Apart from dealing with the paperwork for the farming and
cottage rental business, Mrs Breton uses it to administer her charitable
trust and to deal with other charity work. She discovered 'a firm faith in
Christianity' in the 1960s, and gives away about 10 to 12 per cent of her
income, mainly to Christian organisations. 'I found being a Christian fun;
it also helped me stop feeling guilty about money and to thank God for it.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Low discounts
spur launches - Investment trusts / With the sector, like Hollywood,
starting to develop a taste for sequels, the dying year saw investors spoilt
for choice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The investment trust enthusiast was spoilt for choice in the last quarter of
1993. Fund managers rushed to offer almost every conceivable kind of trust,
as low discounts across the sector made it easy to launch new issues.
Among the most notable launches were:
The largest ever investment trust issue, Mercury's World Mining Trust, which
raised a staggering Pounds 425.8m. Here, the attraction proved to be manager
Julian Baring, whose reputation in the gold market pulled in money from
institutional investors. The trust will buy stocks with interests in gold
and other metals.
The first ethical investment trust from Friends Provident. This had a
split-capital structure, with ordinary income shares and zeros each designed
to yield around 8.1 per cent. A panel of luminaries, including actress
Joanna Lumley, is on hand to help the managers sort out the ethically
correct wheat from the chaff.
A new property investment trusts managed by Baring Investment Management.
The Wigmore Property Investment Trust will aim to outperform the FT-A
Property index.
The Throgmorton Preferred Income Trust, from the Framlington stable, will
invest in preference shares issued by small companies, to help plug a
perceived 'financing gap'.
The first investment trust launch from the merged Henderson Touche Remnant
group. Its Japanese smaller companies trust raised Pounds 100m.
An indexed European smaller companies trust from Providence Capitol and
James Capel.
Like Hollywood, the sector is starting to develop 'sequelitis'. Instead of
Rocky II and Rambo III, the fourth quarter saw the launch of Kleinwort's
Second Endowment Policy Trust and Johnson Fry's Second Utilities Trust.
Lloyd's trusts: all you can lose is your capital
The new-issue activity described above is remarkable enough. What made the
fourth quarter even more extraordinary was the creation of a large new
sector in the industry - the Lloyd's investment trusts.
These have emerged from the insurance market's need to attract new corporate
capital in the wake of the disasters which have hit Names - the private
investors who have traditionally backed the market.
Unlike Names, the new trusts will have limited liability. This means that
the maximum loss which shareholders can suffer is the amount of capital they
invest. By investing across a range of syndicates, the trusts should
eliminate some risk.
Nevertheless, there is 'gearing' built into the trusts. Syndicates can
underwrite Pounds 2 in premium income for every Pounds 1 of capital. That
means that an underwriting return of 10 per cent will turn into a 20 per
cent profit, but it also means that underwriting losses will be magnified.
Much will depend on whether Lloyd's has turned the corner on the disasters
of the late 1980s, or whether there is more bad news to come.
As investment trusts, these funds will be rather odd vehicles. The bulk of
the money raised will go into portfolios of equities, which is
straightforward enough. But, of course, what investors will really be
interested in is the progress of the underwriting business. Under the
three-year system of accounting used by Lloyd's, such figures will not
emerge until 1997, making investment a bit of a leap in the dark.
Telling one trust from another will be difficult in the meantime. Although
Johnson Fry failed to drum up enough support for its fund of funds, broker
Gerard Vivian Gray has a managed portfolio service of Lloyd's trusts, with a
minimum investment of Pounds 20,000.
C shares: a way round the problems of a rights issue
Existing trusts have also been taking advantage of the current enthusiasm
for the sector. The fourth quarter saw a number of trusts raise new money -
with most choosing the route of a C share issue.
The use of C shares is designed to get round some old problems which have
dogged trusts trying to raise new money. A traditional rights issue normally
requires shares to be offered at a discount to their trading price; but this
would normally mean that rights investors are getting assets on the cheap,
diluting the holdings of existing investors. Furthermore, the trust faces
the risk, during the rights period, that a sudden stock market fall could
push the share price below the rights price, turning the issue into a flop.
With a C share issue, the price is set at a nominal level, normally 100p.
Eventually, C shares will be converted into ordinary shares, but only when
all (or nearly all) of the money raised is invested in the stock market.
When conversion does occur, it reflects the asset value of the two classes
of share. Thus, if the asset value of a C share was 100p and that of an
ordinary share 200p, investors would receive one ordinary share for every
two C shares.
This system has a number of advantages. First, it avoids the dilutive effect
of offering shares at a discount. Second, it avoids the risk that a sudden
fall in the stock market might damage the prospects of the issue. Third, it
means the two pools of assets are not mixed until the new money is invested;
accordingly existing shareholders are fully exposed to the market, rather
than having a large part of their portfolios in cash.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): A record year,
but will it change our habits? - Unit trusts / A period of low interest
rates might attract savers away from the safety of building societies
towards the greater returns of collective funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts had their best year ever in 1993. Net sales (gross sales minus
repurchases) were Pounds 8.2bn in the 11 months to the end of December, well
ahead of the previous record established in 1987. Funds under management
edged close to Pounds 90bn, writes Philip Coggan.
Low interest rates were undoubtedly the prime reason for the surge. With
base rates at 6 per cent for much of the year, the income return from
equities (especially when held in the form of a personal equity plan) was
not behind that from deposits. Indeed, many trusts were able to offer
returns well ahead of the building society alternative.
Institutional, as well as private, investors were switching funds from cash
to bonds and equities. The result was an excellent year for share prices - a
fact which reinforced the desire of private investors to buy unit trusts.
Fund managers can hardly believe their luck. Until November 1992, five-year
performance figures were battered by the effects of the stock market crash
of October 1987. At the end of November 1993, the average unit trust had
produced growth of 72 per cent over five years, impressive enough figures to
tempt most private investors.
There is a 'promised land' within sight of the unit trust industry. A long
period of low interest rates might cause a historic shift in British savings
habits; away from the safety (but low returns) available from the building
society and towards the greater returns (but greater risks) of collective
funds. This shift has long since taken place in the US, where the savings &amp;
loans industry (the equivalent of the building society movement) has a
tarnished image.
What investors should demand is an industry which tailors its products to
their needs. One of the most popular types of collective fund in the US is
the low-charging bond fund, which gives investors a safe but steady income.
In the UK, bond funds have never been popular, partly because their high
charges make them look like a poor deal, partly because inflation has eroded
the value of fixed-rate investments.
The only way this circle can be squared is for a major financial name, such
as a high street bank, to launch a low-charging bond fund.
For the fund manager, the only way such funds can work is to attract large
volumes of money - a 0.5 per cent annual charge on a Pounds 1bn fund
represents Pounds 50m a year. It will be interesting to see if a manager
takes up the challenge in 1994.
M&amp;G offers a 'pay as you leave' Pep
One encouraging industry trend is a change in the charging structure. M&amp;G
became the latest group to replace the initial charge on its personal equity
plan with exit charges. This switch, which applies only to the Managed
Income Pep, is designed to reward long-term investors; the exit fee, 4.5 per
cent in the first year, falls to nothing after five years.
Since Peps are supposed to be a long-term investment, this has to be a good
deal for shrewd investors; although M&amp;G's annual fee, at 1.5 per cent,
remains rather high. Over the long run, a higher-than-average annual fee
will drag down the return to the investor.
Fidelity was the first group to introduce Pep exit fees, in 1992. Its
initial charge is 2 per cent; the industry norm is 5-6 per cent.
High-risk funds fare best in a slowly rising market
Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan must be one of the most
successful unit trust launches ever recorded. The fund, which offered a 10
per cent income (tax-free if held in a personal equity plan) uses a complex
strategy involving the sale of call options to generate the income it
offers.
Investors evidently did not worry too much about the detail - with the
return on their building society deposits falling rapidly, they were only
too eager to grasp any product which offered a double-digit return.
Morgan Grenfell eventually followed Hypo F&amp;C's lead and launched a similar
product in October. But in December, Save &amp; Prosper raised doubts about the
safety of such funds when it cancelled the launch of a trust that would have
been run on similar lines. S&amp;P said that its models showed a significant
risk of capital decline.
Investors schooled in the principle of 'greater reward involves greater
risk' should not be too surprised by this. Any fund which yields several
percentage points above both base rates and gilts must either involve some
risk (of capital loss), or be exploiting some anomaly (which will quickly
disappear in an efficient financial market).
In a statement made after S&amp;P had shelved its launch, Hypo F&amp;C and Morgan
Grenfell said: 'These funds should not be confused with guaranteed funds;
the two funds are actively managed according to market conditions. Neither
the income, nor the level of capital, is guaranteed.'
Broadly speaking, these funds will do best in a static, or slowly rising,
stock market. In a fast-rising market, the funds will underperform their
rivals, since, by selling options on their shares, the funds are giving up
capital gain. And in a falling stock market, the funds will lose money
(although they do have protection against a dramatic drop) and the income
they receive from their call options might also dip.
GT European balanced fund aims for 4.25% yield
The quirks of the personal equity plan rules are giving a boost to the
balanced-fund sector. Balanced funds offer a mix of bonds and equities,
enabling them to provide a higher yield, and (in theory at least) a more
stable performance than a pure-equity fund.
Most balanced funds are UK-based. But GT launched a European Equity and Bond
Fund in November, offering a 4.25 per cent gross yield. Nick Train, GT's
investment director, argues that real interest rates (ie rates adjusted for
inflation) still have plenty of scope to fall in Europe. When they do, money
will move out of cash and into equities and bonds, giving a further boost to
the prices of both asset classes.
Furthermore, Train believes that European shares look cheap, relative to
other major markets, on a price-to-assets and a price-to-cashflow basis.
Since more than 50 per cent of the trust's portfolio will be in European
Union shares, the fund will easily qualify for Pep status. The minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000. The initial charge is 5 per cent (4 per cent on
the Pep) and the annual charge is 1 per cent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): If the
next-to-the-worst should happen - Financing the Family / Critical illness
insurance / An illness does not have to be terminal to trigger a claim, or
even prevent your working. And the lump sum can be spent as you wish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Fear of premature death is being replaced by fear of serious illness as a
marketing tool for the life insurance industry. Medical advances mean that
the chance of a family's main wage earner dying before retirement are now
considerably lower than the chance of contracting a serious,
life-threatening but ultimately non-fatal illness.
But a serious illness can still have a devastating impact on a family's
financial situation, and the consequences for a single person can be just as
harsh. A person may never be able to work again after a stroke or heart
attack, or may not be able to return to the same well-paid career. Serious
illness can also put extra strain on what money is coming in, as nursing
care or home alterations may be needed. Life insurance, which pays out only
on death, is useless in such cases.
So recent years have seen the gradual rise of critical illness, or dread
disease, insurance - policies which pay a lump sum if the insured person
contracts one of a list of common serious illnesses, principally heart
attack, stroke, and cancer. It also covers kidney failure, organ transplant,
heart bypass surgery, and total permanent disability. Some insurers also add
other, more obscure, illnesses to the list, but heart attacks, strokes and
cancer account for by far the largest proportion of claims. The one dreaded
disease excluded by virtually all insurers is Aids, or any HIV-related
condition. General Accident is a notable exception to this.
An illness does not have to be terminal to trigger a claim, or even prevent
you from working; and the lump sum can be spent as you wish: to pay for
treatment, clear debts, buy a more manageable home, or take a holiday to
recuperate. Or, if it seems that you may not return to work for some time,
if at all, the money can be invested to provide an income.
Critical illness insurance was first developed in South Africa, and was
introduced in the UK by Cannon Lincoln in the mid-1980s. Most large insurers
now offer policies, and a few smaller companies specialise in it. So far,
sales figures for critical illness insurance have been low, largely because
of lack of understanding by both the public and financial advisers of what
it is and why it is useful.
Another problem which may have been hindering the development of the market
was solved last year. The National Federation of Independent Financial
Advisers (Nfifa) consulted the insurance industry and medical professionals,
and came up with a list of standard definitions of the seven core conditions
covered by critical illness policies. This should put a stop to anomalies,
such as one company paying out for single heart bypass surgery while another
only covers double bypasses. Some companies have already adopted these
definitions, and more are expected to follow. Previously, financial advisers
were wary of critical illness, because they found it difficult to compare
cover offered by different policies.
Insurers are also trying a different tack, and packaging critical illness
together with other products rather than as stand-alone cover. One example
of this is the proliferation of mortgage endowment policies with critical
illness cover as an optional extra. Critical illness can be relatively cheap
as a mortgage add-on, with extra premiums as low as Pounds 5 a month for
young, healthy people with a good family medical history.
Critical illness cover is also frequently packaged together with life
assurance, either term cover or whole-of-life. Such policies pay out either
when you suffer a critical illness or when you die.
Some more innovative critical illness products can be confusing to buy, as
they are parcelled up with long-term care, medical and permanent health
insurance in addition to life cover. The logic behind this is sensible - a
single policy to provide protection for most of life's unpleasant surprises
 -but it can make it difficult to work out what you are paying for and
whether it is good value. Others have a mix-and-match approach, where you
can choose which benefits you want, but it is difficult for most people to
assess whether they are more likely to get a critical illness, or a
long-term incapacitating condition needing nursing home care.
Some insurers have added a terminal illness benefit to standard life
assurance, which means that the sum insured can be paid out as soon as the
insured person is diagnosed as having only a short time to live. This is
much cheaper than critical illness benefit, but it is much more restrictive:
only a small proportion of critical illness claims are from people who have
received a terminal diagnosis.
Permanent health insurance is another related product: it provides a
replacement income if you are unable to work due to health problems. It can
cover non-life-threatening conditions, such as chronic back problems, as
well as serious illnesses, and pays out weekly or monthly benefits rather
than a lump sum. Payments stop as soon as you recuperate, or return to work.
PHI is particularly useful for the self-employed, who are not covered by
company sick pay schemes, but more people are expected to become interested
in it as the government's reforms of the state sick pay system take effect.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Longevity is
raising new obstacles to inheritance - Financing the Family / Care of the
elderly / Assets over Pounds 8,000 are used to pay for care if a person
enters a residential home by arrangement with a local authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
Longevity is putting a strain on many families. Middle-aged couples can find
themselves worrying about two sets of ageing parents, who may slide rapidly
from active self-reliance to total dependency. Some people in their 60s and
70s are still caring for frail parents in their 80s or 90s, writes Bethan
Hutton.
Anyone in this position comes under not only emotional but also financial
pressure: help with caring at home is not cheap, and full-time care in a
nursing home can cost more than the national average wage.
There is still a common assumption that, when people become too frail or
disabled to look after themselves, a whole range of social services opens up
to help. To a certain extent, that is true - if your local social services
department agrees that there is a need, and if you have no means to pay for
yourself.
But the welfare state no longer automatically pays for long-term nursing
care for the elderly. Since April, any elderly person going into a nursing,
or residential, home by the arrangement of a local authority has to be
means-tested; and any assets over Pounds 8,000 are used to pay for care.
This can include the family home, if no spouse or dependent relative is
occupying it.
Local authorities have no power to force the sale of a home, but they can
put a charge on the property and claim some or all of the proceeds when it
is eventually sold.
The means-testing can also include a person's entire occupational pension,
even if he or she has a spouse who is also dependent on it for an income.
With nursing home fees running at Pounds 400 a week or more in some areas,
it does not take long to wipe out the value of a house or a pension. Only
when assets fall below Pounds 8,000 will the state step in.
Families depend on their local authority to assess that the elderly person
needs care - what is an intolerable situation from a carer's point of view
may be seen differently by the social services department, particularly at a
time of year when the budget is already overstretched. In such cases, if the
family feels it can no longer cope, it will have to find the money for
nursing care privately.
Many old people intend their children to inherit the assets, including the
family home, which they have accumulated over the years. The state pays no
attention to such wishes. Transferring ownership of a property or
investments before a person needs to go into a home may be in vain - the law
says that, if a person has deliberately deprived himself of assets to
increase his entitlement to benefits, he will be assessed as if he still had
those assets.
A lot of people remain unaware of the expense and the regulations involved
in caring for a dependent elderly person until they are themselves landed
with the responsibility, or a relative or friend is in that position. At
that stage, they may begin to wonder whether any provision can be made to
prevent them from becoming a burden on their own relatives or the state.
The good news is that provision can be made, but the inevitable bad news is
that it can be very expensive if you leave it until your late 50s or 60s,
which is when the possible effect of old age and infirmity on a family and
its finances tends to penetrate people's awareness.
A handful of insurance companies offer products designed to meet the cost of
nursing home care. As the population ages, and the welfare state is reduced
to a safety net for those who have not made provision for themselves,
further developments are likely in the next few years.
Existing products come into two main categories: point-of-need products,
designed for elderly people in imminent need of care; and long-term
insurance, which is designed for younger people, worried that they may have
to go into a home at some point in the future.
Point-of-need products are generally based on impaired life annuities, for
which a lump sum (perhaps from the sale of a home or a maturing investment)
is needed. Anyone whose health has deteriorated to the stage where they need
to go into a home is likely to have a reduced life expectancy, so insurance
companies are willing to pay them a higher income from a lump sum than a
healthy person of the same age. Sometimes an agreement is made between the
insurance company and the care provider, that fees will go up by a fixed
percentage each year, or follow the retail prices index, so that pay-outs
can be stepped up in line, avoiding any shortfall due to inflation.
Insurance against possible future need is offered by Commercial Union, PPP
Lifetime, and Prime Health, among others. You pay a small regular or large
one-off premium to buy cover for a certain amount a year or a week. If you
already have a good pension, you may only need to insure for a top-up
amount, rather than the full nursing home fees. Couples can choose joint
life policies.
Payment is triggered when a doctor certifies that you have become incapable
of a certain number of 'activities of daily living', such as eating and
going to the toilet unaided. Some policies have a half-way trigger, so that
a portion of the sum insured can be paid when you become partially
incapacitated, but can still remain in your own home.
The third option is to step up your rate of general savings or pension
contributions, to provide an extra cushion against health care costs;
though, of course, this could reduce your entitlement to benefits, and if
you need care for an extended period, your money could run out.
It is sensible to get independent financial advice before picking any of
these products, as structures and prices vary considerably. The suitability
of any of them will depend on your age, state of health, and current
financial position.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): Something
borrowed: but how? - Financing the Family / Paying for the wedding / Even
well-off parents may wonder if elopement isn't a good idea, yet in the end,
most pay up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Your wedding may or may not turn out to be the best day of your life, but it
will probably be one of the most expensive. Even during the past few years
of recession, the average cost of a wedding has crept up to more than Pounds
8,000.
There are more than 300,000 marriages every year in the UK, two thirds of
them first marriages, which are more likely to involve lavish spending on
receptions and outfits, though even the second or third-time bride often
insists on a traditional do.
As with any large project, wedding costs tend to escalate well above
original estimates. You may start by planning a simple occasion, but as time
passes it becomes clear that dozens of relatives would be mortally offended
if they were not invited, so the size of the reception has to be doubled.
Then, after weeks of trying on white lace and ruffles, the bride decides
that the only wedding dress she could possibly wear is hand-made from pure
silk and costs Pounds 1,000. And, of course, the bridesmaids have to look
pretty as well.
Then you flick through a few bridal magazines, and start thinking about the
cost of printing invitations, hiring a photographer, finding a vintage car
or maybe a Rolls Royce for the day. You discover that wedding cake must be
one of the most expensive foods, and that to spend less than Pounds 250 on
fresh flowers would be social suicide. Choristers don't come cheap, and what
about a video?
This is the stage when even comfortably-off parents start dropping hints
about how elopements are so romantic, and that it's the height of fashion
these days to get married in solitude on a Caribbean island. But in the end,
most decide that it's a once-in-a-lifetime occasion (despite statistics to
the contrary), and stump up their share.
Some parents dream of white lace and confetti while their daughter is still
a schoolgirl, and start stashing money away to pay for it all. There is no
harm in that, and if the money is invested wisely it could become a tidy sum
by the time their fond parental imaginings become reality: the average age
for first marriages is now 25 for women and 27 for men.
By their mid-20s, most young people are earning, and there seems to be a
tendency for the bridal couple to make more of a contribution towards the
cost of the wedding than was traditionally the case. About a third of
couples pay for the reception themselves; while some expenses, such as the
honeymoon and gifts for bridesmaids and the best man, have always been the
responsibility of the bridegroom. However, a large part of the burden still
falls on the bride's parents. Although a majority of couples now live
together before they marry, many are heavily mortgaged and have to fall back
on their parents if they want all the usual trimmings.
If you are saving for a wedding at some indeterminate point more than five
years hence, there is a wide range of possible savings vehicles.
Insurance-based savings policies can be inflexible, as they have fixed
maturity dates, and trying to withdraw money early carries heavy penalties.
More likely to be suitable are the various types of building society and
National Savings account. If the money will not be needed for at least five
years, you could use a Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account) or one of
the various NS products with a five-year term. Peps and unit and investment
trust savings schemes are a more risky alternative, as they invest in
shares, but returns can be better than on money kept on deposit, and they
can be cashed in at any time.
The average engagement lasts one year. That does not give the couple much
time to save up for their contribution, but it is sensible to start putting
money aside into a special account as early as possible, because expenses,
such as the deposit for the reception venue, crop up very quickly.
Not many couples would want to start married life in debt, but given the
choice of postponing the wedding for a few years to save up for a big
reception and designer wedding dress, or having a spartan ceremony now, some
prefer to marry in haste, and pay at leisure, with the help of a personal
loan. A few finance companies specialise in providing loans for weddings,
but really there is no reason to choose a specialist rather than an ordinary
unsecured bank or building society loan. Shop around for the best interest
rates, and watch out for arrangement fees and early repayment penalties.
Weddings are complicated events, and a host of occurrences could ruin the
big day, from the hotel going bust and the car breaking down to the marquee
collapsing and the bride's dress getting ripped. A death in the family might
force you to postpone the whole thing. Most possible disasters (apart from
the bride or groom getting cold feet) can be covered by wedding insurance,
which costs about Pounds 30-Pounds 45 for a standard level of cover.
Extensions are available if you have particularly expensive outfits or hired
marquees to worry about.
An insurance broker should be able to find a suitable policy, but some of
the specialists are: Cornhill, Grand UK, Insurex Expo-Sure, Leisurecare,
Methodist Insurance and Provincial.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Small
hurricane on the line - Financing the Family / Home insurance / Phone-based
insurers offer lower premiums - provided you are 'average'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Home insurance is not usually a subject to arouse much emotion. If you own a
house, you insure it, and if you have possessions you would rather not lose,
you insure them too. Then you forget about it, until you make a claim, or
the renewal notice quotes a premium almost twice as high as you remember
paying last year.
Astronomical premium hikes, due to rising burglary and subsidence claims,
have recently alerted consumers to the subject. The newcomer, Direct Line, a
telephone-based insurer, has blown a hurricane through the formerly cosy
world of home insurance, dominated by the big general insurers in
partnership with the banks and building societies. Suddenly competition has
broken out, and the consumer stands to benefit, though the huge back bills
for burglary and subsidence have to be paid for somehow.
Many homeowners have traditionally bought buildings and contents insurance
from their mortgage lender. Sometimes it is a compulsory part of a special
mortgage offer, but usually there is no obligation to buy the building
society's own policy. But since many people are too lazy to shop around, or
are under the mistaken impression that they are tied to their lender,
premiums tend not to be competitive. An added disincentive is that many
lenders charge an 'administration fee' of Pounds 25 or so if you buy
buildings cover elsewhere.
If you check the alternatives, you will find insurers so keen to grab your
business that some will pay the administration fee for you. Even without
that bribe, it should be easy to find a policy cheap enough to cover the
cost of switching.
The new telephone-based insurers can offer lower premiums, but generally
only to 'average' householders: aged over 25, living in standard houses, not
in inner cities, with few particularly valuable possessions. These desirable
customers are being wooed by Direct Line, GA 1-2-1 and a host of others,
with savings of up to 50 per cent on conventional insurers' prices.
Direct Line and its clones have also inspired an outbreak of telephone-based
broking services, which give access to a dozen or more insurance companies'
quotes via one phone call. The one thing they cannot do, however, is shop
around the direct insurers for you, so although they can find a cheaper
quote from conventional insurers, it may not be quite the cheapest on the
market.
But what if you are not a middle-aged couple living in a three-bedroom
suburban semi with a television set, video recorder and a few pieces of
jewellery? Direct insurers lose interest as soon as you reveal that your
home is an inner-city warehouse conversion, containing one enormously
valuable abstract painting and little else. Antique collectors in manor
houses are equally also unwelcome.
However, 'high net worth' individuals (insurance companies seem to feel that
the label 'wealthy' is offensive) and collectors of art and antiques are
being targeted by a number of insurers who require lower premiums for art
works than most companies charge for general household contents. For,
paradoxically, owners of large quantities of precious items are seen as a
lower risk than the average person, whose living-room is adorned only with
consumer electronics, because such people tend to protect their collections
with good security systems.
Unique antiques are also less attractive to casual burglars, as they are
more trouble to dispose of than anonymous electrical equipment. Companies
that offer specialised policies for high-value home contents or amateur
collectors include: Cox Underwriting Services, Artscope, Hiscox,
Masterpiece, Art Insurance Services, LIS and Wellington.
Owners of unusual buildings can also find specialist policies. Several
companies, such as CGA and Holdfast, offer cover for thatched houses, which
are often rejected by mainstream insurers because of the added fire risk.
Other insurers have policies tailored to the needs of listed buildings and
historic properties, which can cost more than ordinary houses to repair or
rebuild.
At the other end of the market, a few insurers have realised that the prices
of many ordinary policies are out of the reach of many inner-city residents,
particularly young people in rented flats or pensioners who do not need
large amounts of insurance. The result is basic policies, with all the
extras stripped out - no accidental damage cover, low minimum sums insured,
and often replacement rather than new-for-old cover. Norwich Union recently
introduced an 'Essentials' plan along these lines, while LIS at Lloyds has
an inner-city policy, with the annual premium for Pounds 10,000 of cover
ranging from Pounds 84 to Pounds 160.
As competition for the best customers heats up, more insurers are offering
discounts - for over-50s, members of neighbourhood watch schemes, people who
install alarms and other security devices, and even for members of certain
clubs and professions. When you request a quote, it is always worth asking
what discounts, if any, are available.
The other way of bringing down your premiums is by agreeing to a voluntary
excess. This means that you pay the first Pounds 50 or Pounds 100 of any
claim, saving insurers the administrative expense of handling lots of small
claims, as well as saving them a little money on larger ones. The higher the
excess, the lower your premium will fall - but you must be sure that you
could afford to shoulder your part of the cost if the crunch came. Not all
insurers have a system of voluntary excesses, but a few make a big point of
it, particularly at the upper end of the market, where excesses can go as
high as Pounds 1,000, to cut premiums by up to a third.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Debt may be
inevitable but watch the interest - Financing the Family / Going to
university / The cheapest loans, after free overdrafts, are from the state
student scheme - but avoid credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
Parents will have to pay less towards their children's university education
from the start of the next academic year, as the government steps up its
programme for shifting the burden of student maintenance away from grants
and parental contributions, and towards more state loans.
But there may still be many parents who are unwilling to see their offspring
start adult life with large debts to pay off, and who prefer to make more
than the contribution required by the state.
Maximum grants for the current academic year are: Pounds 2,845 for students
in London; Pounds 2,265 elsewhere; and Pounds 1,795 for students living with
their parents during term-time. Students can currently borrow between Pounds
470 and Pounds 940 a year from the state Student Loans Company, depending on
where they are studying and whether it is the final year of their course.
Changes announced in the November Budget mean that, from this autumn,
student grants (and therefore mandatory parental contributions) will be cut
by 10 per cent, and the maximum student loan increased to compensate for
this and for the effect of inflation. This means that maximum loans will
increase to between Pounds 915 and Pounds 1,375, or Pounds 670 and Pounds
1,005 for final-year students.
If you are already organising savings for school fees, the cost of three
years' university education can be worked into the equation relatively
easily. However, even parents whose children have used the state education
system up until A-level have no choice about whether to pay when it comes to
university. Grants are means-tested on parental earnings, and anyone with
residual income of more than about Pounds 14,000 has to contribute.
The message from financial advisers is that it is never too early to start
saving for both school and university expenses. Suggestions include personal
equity plans (Peps), building society accounts, tax-exempt special savings
accounts (Tessas), National Savings, unit and investment trusts, and
endowment policies. The combination you choose will depend on: how far in
advance you are planning, your tax position, your attitude to risk, what
savings you have already, and whether lump sums are available to invest or
you are saving out of income.
An independent financial adviser should be able to help work out an
appropriate programme; but be wary of commission-based advisers and tied
agents, who may be tempted to push you towards endowments, which are very
profitable to sell but may not be the most suitable for your needs.
One threat for the future is that some universities, as they see their
government funding gradually reduced, may have to introduce top-up tuition
fees, payable by students or their parents. When the government raised the
possibility of means-tested tuition fees in the mid-1980s, there was a
middle-class revolt, and the idea was dropped, but it has recently returned
to favour in some circles. University vice-chancellors have so far failed to
agree on the issue of fees, but proposals for a number of schemes are under
consideration. Cautious parents, who have sons and daughters due to leave
school in a few years' time, might want to put a little extra aside, just in
case.
If you are about to become a student, you will have a lot to think about and
organise. One of the most important things is to set up a bank account. All
the big high street banks offer special deals for students, involving
incentives such as gift vouchers or cash gifts; but more important are free
banking and interest-free overdrafts.
Debt is now an almost unavoidable part of student life, but some forms of
borrowing are more expensive than others. The most expensive is credit-card
debt - credit card issuers make no special allowances for students, and
charge them the same exorbitant interest rates as everyone else, though some
may waive the annual fee. Credit cards are probably best avoided, unless you
use them strictly for travel and emergencies, and pay off the balance every
month. Unauthorised overdrafts can be almost as expensive: if you think you
are about to go over your agreed limit, tell the bank immediately, and it is
unlikely to penalise you as heavily.
The second cheapest way to borrow, after free overdrafts, is through the
state student loan scheme. Interest is pegged to the rate of inflation (1.2
per cent this year), and repayment does not start until the April after you
graduate. If your earnings are low, repayment can be deferred. The amount
you will be able to borrow will rise steeply over the next few years, and by
1996, loans should account for half of the average student's income. Until
now, a large minority of students have not taken out a student loan, but
this is likely to change as other sources of funding are reduced.
Even students who take out the maximum loan can still suffer a financial
shortfall, particularly if they study in areas with high rents, as they are
no longer eligible for housing benefit. The government does provide some
emergency money, known as access funds, to be distributed by universities to
students facing hardship, but there is rarely enough to go round all the
applicants.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Tots have a
tax allowance, too - Financing the Family / Children's savings / But a
pitfall awaits parents. If one of them gives the capital, and income from it
exceeds Pounds 100 a year, it is taxed as the parent's income
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Children are big business. Every year they receive more than Pounds 600m in
gifts, earnings and pocket money, which makes them a popular target for
financial institutions.
Special accounts and savings schemes for children are now actively promoted
by banks, building societies, friendly societies, investment houses and the
government's own National Savings.
But parents or relatives must first decide how best to channel a young
person's enthusiasm for saving. Is the objective, simply to teach them the
rudiments of budgeting through a bank or building society account, with
instant access to their money, the bonus of a small amount of interest and,
in some cases, freebies such as stickers, magazines and money boxes? Or are
they to be encouraged to think of longer-term investments, which could go
towards buying a first car?
Whatever the circumstances, the most important consideration is the tax
position of children. Each is entitled to the general personal tax allowance
of Pounds 3,445. That means a child can earn a weekly income of up to Pounds
66.25 without notifying the taxman.
But, as Inland Revenue spokeswoman Eleanor Graham points out, there is a
pitfall for unwary parents: 'If it is one of the parents who has given the
capital, and the income produced from that capital is more than Pounds 100 a
year, then the whole of that income is taxed as the parent's income.'
There is another essential part of the tax equation which is still not
always appreciated. Many non-taxpayers - including children - have still not
been registered with the tax authorities to receive bank and building
society interest without having tax automatically deducted at source. The
Revenue is not clairvoyant, so parents, guardians or relatives should ensure
that they complete the Revenue's R85 form to receive interest payments
gross. The form is available at banks, building societies and local tax
inquiry offices.
Mark Hemingway, a spokesman for the Halifax, the UK's largest society, says:
'We have three children's accounts - Little Xtra, Quest and Maxim - for
different age groups. But of our 1.8m childrens' accounts, only about 55 per
cent have so far registered to receive gross interest. It is very
disappointing.'
Tax-breaks aside - and their importance should not be underestimated - the
choice of a particular bank or building society could boil down to
high-street branch accessibility or, where parents bank. According to the
latest Moneyfacts guide to investment rates, which is available in a number
of larger public libraries, there are nearly 50 societies and 12 banks with
special childrens' accounts.
Interest rates range from the Alliance &amp; Leicester's 0.25 per cent gross on
sums of Pounds 1 in the Cash Plus account, to the Norwich &amp; Peterborough's
6.3 per cent gross for minimum deposits of Pounds 250 in its Head Start
Bond. Somewhere in between is the Chelsea Building Society's Kids account,
paying 3.55 per cent gross. The Hertfordshire-based Harpenden Building
Society's 18 Club account pays 7 per cent gross on Pounds 5 or more, but the
money cannot be touched until the account holder is 18.
Generally speaking, children can access their own bank and building society
accounts from the age of seven.
Among the banks, Lloyds' Young Savers account, for children up to the age of
11, pays gross interest of 1 per cent up to Pounds 50 and 1.5 per cent on
Pounds 50 to Pounds 100. The bank's Headway account, which is for 12- to
18-year-olds, pays the same interest.
Generally speaking, building societies pay better interest rates than the
banks. On the other hand, if young savers are also concerned about freebies,
the banks are a better bet. Lloyds' Headway, for example, offers a free
camera, while Midland's LIVE]Cash will offer a free driving lesson where
appropriate. Barclays gives free membership of the Our Price Music Club,
with Pounds 10 vouchers; and Bank of Scotland gives its Express account
holders, aged 12 to 17, half-yearly newsletters and audio cassette tapes.
For longer-term investors, the first port of call is National Savings. Issue
F of the NS Children's Bonus Bond, for example, pays a tax-free and
guaranteed return of 7.35 per cent a year, provided it is held for five
years. The minimum purchase is Pounds 25 and the maximum Pounds 1,000, but,
under a new concession, that is in addition to any investment in previous
issues.
Other National Savings accounts which could be suitable for children include
the one-month-notice Investment Account, which pays 5.25 per cent gross on
up to Pounds 499. The instant access NS Ordinary Account pays 2 per cent
gross on deposits of Pounds 10, and the first Pounds 70 of annual interest
is tax-free. For the racier-minded parent, grandparent or even
great-grandparent - the child must be a direct descendant - Pounds 100 in
Pounds 1 Premium Bonds bought this month gives a 100 chances of winning the
new Pounds 1m NS jackpot.
After gross-paying NS accounts, the next step to maximise tax advantages
could be a 10-year tax-exempt Friendly Society Bond, such as Family
Assurance's Junior bond or Homeowners' Children's Cash Builder bond. Up to
Pounds 18 a month can be invested in such schemes.
Friendly society bonds are based on stock market investments with a tax
sweetener. There are, however, no such breaks for children through personal
equity plans, as these cannot be held by anyone aged under 18.
That does not mean that straightforward long-term investments cannot be made
in the stock market through a unit or investment trust, regardless of tax
incentives. Invesco MIM has for some years managed the Rupert Children's
unit trust, which invests in top UK companies, and has a monthly savings
level of just Pounds 10. And last month the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds (Autif) published a free one-page guide on suitable
investment gifts for children.
Homeowners' Friendly Society offers a free booklet, 'Your Guide to Savings
for Children' (Tel 0800 591137). Autif's free 'How to Do It' guide is
available from Children's Savings Guide, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B 6TD.

Parents who want their children to attend private schools can be under no
illusion as to the financial mountain ahead of them.
Those who are now cooing over a pram could face a bill of more than Pounds
200,000 if they want their infant prodigy to be educated at a boarding
school for 10 years. In today's money, that is roughly three times the cost
of the 'average' house.
Yet despite a recession that has cut a swathe through the incomes of many of
the professional middle class, more than 600,000 children, or 7.5 per cent
of the school population, now attend independent schools.
One positive piece of good news for their parents is that annual school fees
inflation, which has been in double figures for the past three years, has
eased to around 4 to 5 per cent, according to the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis).
If the government manages to make its public sector pay-freeze stick, this
should also spill over into the independent sector. Labour costs absorb 75
to 80 per cent of a day school's costs, and 55 to 65 per cent of the
expenses of a boarding school.
But school fees inflation is down, not out, and it continues to outstrip
price inflation. Dick Davison, deputy director of Isis, says: 'The most
consistent piece of advice remains. Whatever the RPI, parents should assume
that school fees inflation will be higher.'
The message for parents who want a private education for their children is
therefore simple: it is never too early to plan for future fees.
Anne Feek, managing director of specialist financial adviser, the School
Fees Insurance Agency (SFIA), says: 'If you are going to make the commitment
to educate your children privately, you should make some provision. And
there is a double value in planning. You not only reduce the costs; you
secure your child's future. If anything happens to you, the money is there.'
However, only 20 per cent of parents do any advanced planning, according to
Joe Collins, managing director of specialist financial adviser Invest for
School Fees. The others travel in hope, either paying immediate fees out of
capital or their taxed income, or postponing the pain by using a loan
scheme.
Parents with capital have the easiest planning task - funding school fees in
advance out of a lump sum can reduce the eventual bill by one half or even
two thirds.
Unfortunately, the economic times have dented the attractions of educational
trusts, one favoured planning route. Payments from a trust are tax-free
under current legislation, but contributions are used to buy an annuity and
there is little incentive to lock into such an arrangement with interest
rates at almost a 30-year low.
As Charles Levitt-Scrivener, director of financial adviser Towry Law, says:
'At the moment, educational trusts are only for the really risk-averse
investor.'
Today's low interest rates have prompted the SFIA to launch a Versatile
Education Plan that does not require funds to be locked into a fixed rate.
Feek says the plan 'is still based on an annuity and still provides the tax
advantage of an educational trust, but it has potential for growth while you
are waiting to take the fees.'
Composition fees, schemes operated by many schools, provide a discount on
fees paid in advance. If the child will not attend the school for, say, four
years, there could be a 50 per cent reduction in fees.
Schools in the throes of a large expansion programme, and hungry for cash,
tend to offer particularly keen deals. However, composition fees schemes can
be inflexible, and parents who have any doubts as to whether their child
will attend a particular school must ensure that a scheme is transferable.
Apart from these two specialist vehicles, there is nothing abstruse about
the component parts of a school fees plan. The trick is to package a mix of
investment vehicles to provide secure funding when this is needed, while
retaining sufficient flexibility to respond to changed needs.
As Levitt-Scrivener says: 'The nightmare school fees clients are those who
are mortgaged up to the hilt; involved in a divorce; and have just lost
their job.'
The design of any school-fees plan is dictated by four factors: the likely
size of future bills; the parents' means; their attitudes to risk; and
whether plans are to be funded out of capital or income.
Traditionally, a series of with-profit endowment policies, maturing each
year during the child's school life, have provided the backbone of many
plans. But poor surrender values, and the possible tax consequences of early
discontinuance, make the contracts unsuitable if fees are needed within 10
years, and Levitt-Scrivener believes that with-profits endowments 'are not
very flexible now white-collar jobs are not as secure as they used to be'.
Joe Collins remains an enthusiast, however. He says: 'In terms of planning
ahead, the tried and tested with-profits system still works well, and much
of the recent criticism has been unfair and unjustified.'
Tax-privileged vehicles - Tessas, National Savings certificates, friendly
society policies and personal equity plans - are also widely used in school
fees plans, although Peps may not suit parents who want to secure a specific
sum of money at a specific time.
Collins warns: 'Those who rely on Peps are being lured by the tax relief.
They are not looking at the inherent nature of the contract. Parents should
not use only Peps and unit trusts for school fees planning when the market
is so high.'
In today's low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment, school fees
planners should guard against over-optimism about future investment returns.
It is also sensible to underpin investments with an insurance scheme, such
as the Isis Educare, Future Term and Feesure arrangements. The death,
disability or unemployment of a parent can torpedo the best-laid school fees
plan.
Borrowing is the last-resort option for parents who cannot pay fees out of
their current resources. For instance, the Isis School Fees Special Reserve
Account, a scheme offered in conjunction with financial adviser Claremont
Savile, provides a borrowing facility secured on residential property.
Interest rates mirror mortgage rates.
Louise Challis, Claremont Savile's managing director, says that 80 per cent
of those who use Special Reserve 'have not been able, or have not chosen, to
plan ahead or haven't done enough. But Special Reserve is also suitable for
those parents who can afford the fees, but do not choose to pay them at the
present time.'
Inevitably the slump in the housing market means that some parents have
insufficient capital in their home to provide security for an additional
loan. They must move into more expensive loan territory. For example, Sun
Life's Policy Secured Plan provides a loan facility with the Royal Bank of
Scotland, secured by a Sun Life policy. The interest charged is base rate
plus 4.5 per cent, with a floor of 10 per cent.
Finally, parents who run into fee-paying difficulties should not be too
embarrassed to investigate whether there is scope for some horse-trading,
particularly if they have more than one child.
As one adviser says: 'Schools are like airlines, with the same high fixed
costs and the same need to keep bums on seats. More sophisticated school
bursars recognise this.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Shares fare
best in the long term - Financing the Family / Whatever the need, companies
offer products that they claim will fit the bill. But it can be a mistake to
rely wholly on 'manufactured' solutions. The surest answer is far-sighted
saving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Most aspects of family life have a financial dimension. If you own a home,
you need to insure the building; wherever you live, you need to insure your
possessions. If you have children, you may want to educate them privately,
or give them a lavish wedding: both require financial planning.
Where there is a financial need, there are sure to be companies offering
products which, they claim, will exactly fit the bill. But it is a mistake
to think that one must rely on specifically-designed products. The only
answer to a long-term financial commitment is long-term saving, and unit or
investment trusts, particularly held in personal equity plan form, may well
be better for the purpose than 'manufactured' products.
Certainly, the sooner you start to save, the better. The remarkable effects
of compound interest are often forgotten. Someone who invests Pounds 1,000
and earns 10 per cent per annum will have Pounds 1,610 after five years;
after 18 years, they will have Pounds 5,600.
Furthermore, the greater the time period, the more the saver can rely on
equities for the bulk of his portfolio. Equities have repeatedly shown
themselves to be the best long-term investment. They may be beaten by cash
or bonds over five years, but it is very rare indeed for shares not to prove
the best investment over 10-year periods.
Once the time periods get longer than that, the outperformance of equities
becomes staggering. According to BZW, Pounds 1,000 invested in equities in
1945 would have grown to Pounds 125,690 (with net income reinvested) by the
end of 1991; but to just Pounds 9,400 had it been placed in the building
society.
A regular savings plan in a unit or investment trust - or better still, two
or three different savings plans - as well as providing good long-term
returns will also be more flexible than the industry's favourite product,
the endowment policy.
Investing for children can be more complex, mainly because of the tax
regulations. The Inland Revenue prevents parents from avoiding tax simply by
transferring investments into the names of the children. If parents give
capital to children which produces income of more than Pounds 100 a year,
then the whole of that capital is taxed as if it were the parents'.
Nevertheless, careful planning can avoid these problems. The Inland Revenue
rules do not apply to money given by grandparents, for example, allowing
each child to exploit his or her personal allowance of Pounds 3,445. And
there are also tax-free investments for children, such as National Savings
and friendly society bonds.
When it comes to protecting the family against disaster, consumers are often
unwilling to face the costs involved. Car insurance is, of course,
compulsory; and house contents insurance is accepted as a necessity by most
people. Both, however, have become substantially more expensive in recent
years, leading many to economise by taking out 'no frills' policies or by
under-insuring. Such tactics, understandable in the face of soaring
premiums, can be false economies. Rising crime statistics are not a mirage,
and the distress of a car accident, fire or burglary will only be increased
by financial disaster.
It is certainly worth shopping around to try to reduce your premium bill -
although the new telephone-based direct insurers are choosy about the
policyholders they will accept.
An even less palatable subject for consumers to accept is their own
mortality. Although endowment policies were sold by the lorryload in the
1980s, cheaper term-insurance policies proved less popular. Perhaps this is
because there is no pay-out if the policyholder survives the term. But the
lack of a savings element in term insurance means that consumers can get a
much bigger 'bang for their buck' in terms of family protection.
The rule of thumb used to be that the head of the household should have
insurance equivalent to 10 times his salary, in order to provide adequately
for his dependants on death. Perhaps, with low interest rates reducing the
income received from a capital sum, that sum should be even higher. Given
that the average annual salary is Pounds 15,000, this implies that each
household should have life insurance covering at least Pounds 150,000. Many
people may not have anything like this cover, although employees should find
out whether their companies provide death-in-service benefits.
Death is not the only tragedy that can strike a family. The growth of
so-called 'critical illness' policies has been fuelled by statistics showing
that many people often survive heart attacks and strokes. However, the
survivors of these illnesses often find that their wage-earning abilities
have been impaired, and they may face extra costs in the shape of nursing or
home help.
Early policies were dogged by some complex provisions covering the range of
illnesses that provoke a pay-out. A list of standard illness definitions has
been developed, which should help consumers to know what they are buying.
The 'greying' of the British population creates another financial problem -
paying for long-term care. The elderly can no longer rely on their children,
or on the state, to look after them, and the cost of private health care is
rising faster than inflation. It has been estimated that the demand for
long-term care will rise by 50 per cent over the next 40 years.
One particular problem is that much of elderly people's wealth is locked up
in the form of their homes. This led to financial scandals in the 1980s as
many were persuaded into dubious home-income schemes, in which houses were
remortgaged and the proceeds invested in insurance bonds. Interest rates
then rose, the bonds fell in value and investors found the cost of servicing
their mortgages was eating into their capital.
While there are respectable home-income schemes - mostly based on annuities
 -probably the best way of releasing capital from a house is to sell it and
move to a cheaper property. Many are reluctant to do this, however, because
it may involve moving away from long-standing friends and other social
links.
There is an obvious need, therefore, for long-term health care insurance,
but the market at the moment is fairly underdeveloped, with two companies,
Commercial Union and PPP Lifetime, leading the way. But given the growing
need in this area, it is surely likely that other insurers will develop
policies over the next few years.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Repayment
mortgages are back - What's new?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years, repayment mortgages have become almost unmentionable among
lenders. They preferred to promote mortgages backed by endowment policies,
and which promised at once the prospect of a return in excess of the loan to
the borrower and fat commission to the lender.
But the virtues of repayment mortgages are beginning to become a selling
point, now that bonus cuts by insurance companies have raised doubts about
whether endowment policies will in future produce enough money to pay off
the loans that they back.
The Australian-owned Yorkshire Bank, operating beyond the bounds of its
eponymous county, is the latest institution to suggest that homebuyers may
be able to make substantial savings by using a repayment mortgage and
increasing payments each year to shorten the term.
For example, Yorkshire Bank says that someone borrowing Pounds 30,000 via
its flexible-payment mortgage, and increasing the initial monthly payment of
Pounds 186.76 by 1.5 per cent a year, would pay off the loan in 17 years 9
months, instead of the standard 25 years.
Assuming the bank's current variable mortgage rate of 7.65 per cent on the
flexible payment mortgage (APR 8 per cent), the borrower would repay a total
of Pounds 56,662, or Pounds 11,753 less than by repaying over 25 years.
On the same basis, a borrower of Pounds 50,000 would repay a total of Pounds
94,273 over 17 years 9 months: Pounds 19,597 less than over 25 years.
Yorkshire Bank charges an arrangement fee of Pounds 150 on the flexible
payment mortgage, which must be repaid by the borrower's 65th birthday. This
means borrowers will have to be under 40, because the bank wants them to be
able to switch back to the 25-year term if increasing payments to reduce the
term become too onerous.
The bank also sets the minimum loan in terms of the monthly payment that a
borrower would have had to make on a 25-year mortgage. There is no upper
limit, though the bank uses its normal criterion of three times main salary,
plus any secondary salary.
There are no penalties or fees for early redemption, in part or in full.
Repayments can be made weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and interest is
calculated daily. Borrowers select the level of payment the intend to make
each year.
UCB Home Loans Corporation, based in Sutton, Surrey, has just launched the
Term Master repayment mortgage, allowing borrowers the choice of monthly
repayment, which can be altered at will on payment of Pounds 25 for each
change.
Higher payments reduce the term. For example, a borrower paying Pounds 327 a
month towards a Pounds 50,000 Term Master mortgage would repay the loan in
25 years, assuming UCB's current variable rate of 7.49 per cent (APR 7.8 per
cent).
A Pounds 34 increase in the monthly payment would cut the term by five
years, saving about Pounds 14,000 on the total cost of the mortgage.
UCB has an administration fee of Pounds 200, and charges a penalty of one
month's interest if borrowers redeem the mortgage before the full term last
arranged.
Foreign &amp; Colonial, the investment trust group, this week launched a pension
plan to be invested in its flagship Pounds 1.6bn F&amp;C Investment Trust.
The F&amp;C pension savings plan will be available either as a personal pension
or as an additional voluntary contributions (AVC) plan, with minimum
contributions of Pounds 5,000 as a lump sum, Pounds 1,000 a year or Pounds
100 per month.
Charges on the plan are to be fixed at an initial Pounds 100, plus a renewal
charge of Pounds 50 a year and a fund management charge of 0.5 per cent.
As investors in the F&amp;C Investment Trust, pension plan holders will have
full shareholders' rights to vote and attend the annual general meeting,
which will also give them an opportunity to question the trust's fund
managers.
After some months of negotiation with the Inland Revenue, Provident Life
will next week launch a flexible annuity portfolio, which will allow people
to retire but leave most of their accumulated pension fund invested, instead
of having to buy an annuity immediately.
Customers transferring at least Pounds 150,000 to the flexible annuity
portfolio from either occupational schemes or personal pensions, including
Section 32 buy-out policies, will receive a minimum payment of Pounds 7,500
a year.
They will have the option of converting to a guaranteed annuity at any time,
but conversion is automatic if the fund falls below the Pounds 7,500
minimum.
Negotiations with the Revenue focused on whether the annual payments could
correctly be defined as an annuity - Provident Life said they could, as
current law describes an annuity as a source of pension payments.
Customers can invest either in Provident Life's own funds or in a range of
other investments of their choice.
Provident Life says the portfolio is much more flexible than other phased
retirement arrangements on the market, noting that it will allow customers
to remain invested beyond the age of 75 instead of being compelled to buy a
final annuity at that point.
Commission is not loaded into the product but is negotiable.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): The Chinese
rediscover their postal heritage - Alternative investments, starting in
stamps, 2 / The second article in this quarterly series considers the
attractions of the Far East for collectors - and in particular the growing
importance of the world's next economic giant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is just possible that the stamp world is about to enter its first period
of genuine expansion for many decades. China is rapidly growing more
prosperous, and the signs are that the Chinese will spend some of their new
wealth on stamps.
Many Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore have already caught the
stamp bug; and China itself had millions of collectors before the advent of
communism and the Cultural Revolution, when to own foreign stamps was a
serious offence.
Now, with greater freedom, some observers expect that within a decade or so
there could be as many stamp collectors in China as in the US. At least at
first, their interest will be concentrated on Chinese stamps.
Already these, like the stamps of other far eastern countries, have become
the most sought after sector of the market. Twenty years ago, Chinese stamps
were valued little more than paper; now, anyone with a good collection can
afford to wait and watch prices rise and rise.
Some indication of the interest in Chinese stamps was provided by Sotheby's
auction of Major James Starr's collection in 1991. It was reckoned to be
among the four or five best of China in the world, and was estimated to make
Pounds 800,000-Pounds 1m. It sold for Pounds 2m., with all the 993 lots
finding buyers. The rarest item, a Dollars 1 on 3 cents stamp of 1897, of
which only 32 are known to survive, was forecast at Pounds 80,000. It sold
to a Taiwanese collector for Pounds 132,000. Ten years ago this stamp would
have cost less than Pounds 10,000.
There was a slight dip in demand as collectors restored their finances after
such a splurge, but now Chinese stamps have resumed their upward spiral.
Last March, a presentation set of Chinese stamps, estimated at Pounds
40,000, sold for Pounds 133,500, also to Taiwan.
There is undoubtedly an investment element in the purchases (the Hong Kong
Chinese store their collections away from the colony as its absorption into
China approaches), but in the main the Chinese seem genuine collectors of
their past postage. Moreover, unlike many former colonised countries, the
Hong Kong Chinese are equally happy to buy Hong Kong stamps of the imperial
period, and have a keen eye for rarities. A routine Queen Victoria Hong Kong
stamp might sell for Pounds 10, but one cancelled in one of the more obscure
Treaty ports on the South China coast could go for up to Pounds 50,000.
This enthusiastic buying by the Chinese makes things hard for British,
American and continental collectors of Chinese and Hong Kong stamps. (The
finest collection is owned by a Swedish banker, and is valued at up to
Pounds 30m). For example, a Queen Victoria colonial cover usually costs
about Pounds 100: a Hong Kong colonial cover is nearer Pounds 1,000. Of
course, it does mean that anyone who built up a collection a generation ago
has secured a very good investment.
The big stamp auctioneers, like Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, and the
leading dealers, like Stanley Gibbons, expect no falling away in Chinese
demand. They have before them the example of Thailand, which is currently
stamp mad. A recent stamp exhibition there attracted a crowd of 500,000: in
the UK, a similar event would be doing well if 15,000 attended. The prices
of some Thai stamps have risen thirtyfold as the new rich buy up the
national hegemony. Even though Thai postal history is straightfoward and
relatively unexciting, with few great rarities, demand is still forcing
prices higher.
Most of the nations of south-east Asia have enjoyed an economic boom, and
some of the new prosperity has gone into stamp collecting, invariably of the
postage of the nation - Japanese collect Japan; Thais, Thailand, and so on.
Some nations still await the experience - South Korea is mysteriously slow,
and there must be potential in Indonesia and the Phillipines.
Some of the nations, like South Korea, have a quite boring postal history,
which could hold back interest. Others, like North Korea, are as frozen as
China 20 years ago. Brunei may contain the richest man in the world, but he
is no stamp collector, and there is nothing in the state's postal history to
set the pulse racing.
One problem is that newly independent nations are not particularly attached
to the postal arrangements of their former European overlords. This is the
situation in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, where the early stamps are
still collected minly by the British, Dutch and the French respectively, in
a mood of colonial nostalgia. These tend to be quiet markets, inhibited by
the paucity of good material, and relatively few buyers. Singapore is rather
similar. For a couple of thousand pounds you could complete a set of the
Singaporean postage; but quite a few collectors have the same ambition, so
demand is brisk.
Japan is a strong market. Against the global trend, it is young people in
Japan who are the keenest collectors. Some Japanese industrialists have
invested millions in amassing important collections of the stamps of the US
and even the UK, which is venerated as the fount of postal history. This is
partly because stamps came late to Japan, in the 1870s, and the postage is
straightforward. Japanese postal history offers greater scope for
collectors. There is, however, one Japanese stamp, from the first issue,
which has its centre inverted. It is believed to be unique, and could sell
for Pounds 1m if it appeared on the market. The rich Japanese like to spread
their wealth around many investment markets, and stamps is one beneficiary.
Many pre-1900 stamps of the Far East are in collections in the west, and
often turn up as overlooked discoveries. This is the part of the album that
the experts turn to first. But now the stamps are returning home. They can
fetch much higher prices in Hong Kong and Bangkok than in London, and there
are dealers that specialise in the repatriation.
The problem is that the increase in prices has helped to dry up the supply.
Owners of good collections expect even higher values. The troubles of the
Japanese economy in 1993 should alert them to the fact that the far eastern
boom will not necessarily last for ever.
In the next issue of the Review, Antony Thorncroft will discuss the stamps
of countries that comprise the American continent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): A time for
caution and locking in - The professionals / The portfolios had a useful
1993, but now our fund managers are more circumspect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This feature is an allocation exercise, to see how four fund managers handle
a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client - a wealthy
individual or a small self-administered pension fund. The managers emphasise
that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for
short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The
portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning of this month, and will
be reviewed at the end of March.
The fourth quarter of 1993 was a good one for most equity and bond
investors, and our four professional fund managers can look back on healthy
profits.
As they look ahead, however, they are cautious, and inclined to lock in some
of 1993's gains. Paul Myners, of Gartmore, says: 'It is likely that the best
selling opportunity will be at some point in the first quarter;
nevertheless, I think we will do some trimming now.' He has switched 7.5 per
cent of his portfolio into US dollar deposits.
A similar approach is taken by Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford: 'We
are trimming each of our four areas of investment to raise cash amounting to
10 per cent of the portfolio. The cash will be held in US dollars, to take
advantage of expected relative interest rate movements.'
Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Management, has been the most cautious
for some time, and takes a cynical view of the recent strength of stock
markets: 'The bulls are currently rampaging in the world's financial markets
with as little regard for their eventual fate as their animal confreres who
run the streets of Pamplona in an annual rush to oblivion.'
Tim Howe, of Singer &amp; Friedlander, is probably the most optimistic: 'In
general, economic conditions continue to favour equity investment, although
investors will continue to earn real returns from fixed-interest investments
and cash.' Nevertheless, he too is cashing in some of his gains. 'A number
of the far-eastern markets now look overheated following their dramatic
outperformance.'
The portfolios still show a strong equity bias, however, with the proportion
varying from 75 to 85 per cent:
The biggest change by Howard Beaufort during the quarter was to sell the
portfolio's holding in US Treasuries when the long bond yield dipped below
5.9 per cent. Nevertheless, 'with inflation remaining firmly under control
throughout most of the developed world, and with interest rates, outside the
US, still on a firmly downward trend, we retain our bullish stance towards
quality bond and fixed-interest investment. The UK gilt market, in
particular, seems well placed to consolidate its 1993 advance.'
'New UK equity investment at current levels is taking a great deal on trust,
and must be virtually restricted to really solid growth companies. European
stock markets have been driven up by well over 25 per cent on average in
1993, largely on the back of US investors seeking overseas outlets for their
funds and believing that interest rates will fall far and fast enough to
justify the current heady ratings. Such implicit faith in European economic
recovery next year may well prove misguided.
'The US stock market has been dominated by continuing evidence that the pace
of growth has picked up. Having risen by just 8 per cent in 1993, the US
equity market may be more firmly rooted in reality than most. In Tokyo, we
believe that prolongation of the recession, and the realisation that the
climb back is going to be very long and very slow, will tend to keep
investors on the sidelines in the immediate term.'
Douglas McDougall was to switch his holdings of long US government bonds
into long UK gilts. 'This was a profitable move, as US government bonds have
since shown a negative return' he points out. 'The portfolio also benefited
from our concentration in UK and south-east Asian equities, our absence from
the US and Japanese markets and our big holdings of long gilts.'
'Stock market valuations, especially in terms of yield, are now expensive by
historical standards in all major areas. The rise in equities over the past
year or so has been driven by falling interest rates, and in particular by
the low, or even negative, real short-term rates of interest in the US.
Short rates in the US look likely to rise before long, while bond yields in
the US have now risen by around 10 per cent from their lows, and bond yields
in the UK and Europe are unlikely to have a great deal further to fall.'
'Both the asset allocation moves we made last time added value', says Paul
Myners. 'We switched money from gilts into European equities, and from US
bonds into cash. All in all, the UK looks well placed among world stock
markets. While we are moving to a more defensive posture, the UK would not
be at the front of the queue to take profits.
'The US economy is beginning to pleasantly surprise, and we believe this
will continue. Unfortunately this is far from positive for equities, as it
is likely to lead to a rise in interest rates.
'While we are not predicting a major bear phase, it seems probable that a
rise in rates could trigger a 10 to 15 per cent correction in the US. Any
monetary tightening will affect the rest of the world, given the
accelerating flow of US capital into international equities. All markets
have benefited from this in 1993 and all will suffer if it reverses.
'European markets are looking particularly vulnerable, given the weakness of
their underlying economies. Their stock markets have taken heart this year
from the long-expected cut in interest rates. Unfortunately rates have not
been cut swiftly enough to save the economies, and no worthwhile recovery
will now be seen until 1995. This leaves some scope for disappointment on
corporate profits in the shorter term.
'Asia (ex Japan) continues to offer the best economic prospects. However,
the markets increasingly reflect this and some profit-taking is probably in
order.'
Tim Howe says: 'It appears that the bull market in bonds is almost over.
Although there remains scope for significant interest rate cuts in
continental Europe, any capital gain in European bonds is likely to be
negated by capital weakness against sterling. We have therefore sold our
holding of European bonds and reinvested the proceeds in long dated UK
index-linked stock.
'In the UK market, it is likely that small to medium capitalisation stocks
will outperform their larger FT-SE 100 brethren. While retaining our overall
weighting in the UK market, we are tempted selectively to take profits from
our holdings in larger companies, and reinvest in smaller groups.
'The US market continues to look relatively expensive.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): The bull
market may be entering its final phase - Bonds / Last year's strong total
returns in Europe are unlikely to be repeated in 1994, with a question-mark
over current yield levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the outlook for Europe's government bond markets remains broadly
positive, bonds are no longer an obvious buy.
Brokers may be keen to point to the strong total returns posted by
government bond markets in 1993, but the fact is that these are unlikely to
be repeated.
The Salomon World Government Bond Index posted total returns, in local
currency terms, of 14.77 per cent last year: for currency-hedged,
sterling-based investors, that rises to 16.03 per cent, and for hedged,
D-mark-based investors to 17.76 per cent.
Individual markets performed spectacularly: Italy returned 28.75 per cent
and Spain 28.49 per cent in local currency terms; Sweden and Denmark both
offered local currency returns of more than 21 per cent, while the UK
reached 22 per cent.
These returns take account of both the yield and the capital gains earned on
bonds: one reason why they are unlikely to be repeated is simply that the
long rally has brought yields down to much lower levels at the start of this
year.
This means that, even before looking at economic fundamentals and market
expectations, there is a question-mark over the attractiveness of current
yield levels.
With Japanese 10-year government bond yields now down to around 3 per cent,
that market is losing favour. Although the prognosis for the Japanese
economy is far from good - and therefore short-term rates are likely to
remain low - the prospects for substantial capital gains are limited.
The US Treasury market is also falling out of favour: with continued signs
of a pick-up in economic growth, some analysts expect short-term rates to
start rising again this year. Although many dealers say the US Treasury
market is currently looking cheap, after its latest sell-off, potential
gains are likely to be made by technical traders switching in and out of the
market, and it looks a rather risky market to hold.
There is a general consensus that the European government bond markets are
preferable to both the US and Japan, because they offer higher current
yields and European economies are further behind in the economic cycle, and
therefore interest rates still have some way to fall.
But there is a widespread fear that, if US rates start to move up, the heavy
flow of US investment which has poured into the European markets will be
reversed, as US investors return to domestic funds such as money market
funds.
The current favourite among European markets appears to be Italy. The market
has proved volatile, experiencing several sharp declines on concerns about
political uncertainty. But these now appear to have been priced into the
market, and there are widespread expectations that, in the longer run,
yields have substantially further to fall. Although there could be further
volatility ahead of the spring elections, there is growing confidence that
Italy's fiscal problems have been tackled, and that a change in government
would not bring fundamental shifts in economic policy.
Mr Juonni Kokko, an international economist, at S G Warburg, points out that
there is still a 300-basis-point spread between 10-year Italian and German
government bond yields, leaving plenty of room for some narrowing.
However, the partial collapse of the exchange rate mechanism has increased
the importance of the currency component of bond investments.
For example, unhedged sterling-based investors made their strongest gains in
Japan, which returned 30.21 per cent; while Italy returned a relatively
disappointing 13.37 per cent and Spain a paltry 5.75 per cent last year,
according to Salomon Brothers.
'The big question is: are we going to reach an important watershed this
year? Interest rates can't fall forever,' warns Mr Phillip Saunders, head of
currency and fixed-interest management at Guinness Flight. 'Returns on bonds
will be more a function of income, and currency will have a more significant
effect.'
For example, he said that the Spanish market was currently attractive, but
only if the currency exposure is stripped out.
Several analysts are also bullish on Sweden and Denmark. Phyllis Reed,
international economist at BZW, recommends an overweight position in
Denmark. 'We continue to think that Danish bonds provide decent value
relative to the rest,' she says, citing expectations that Danish short-term
rates could fall below those in Germany in coming months.
But she is cautious on the outlook for the bond market's performance
relative to equities: 'We are tending to say that people should shift into
equity markets - and it is certainly a long time before we will start
recommending cash.'
While investors may improve their returns by choosing the right market or
buying the long end of the yield curve, there is a growing note of caution,
as the bull market for bonds appears to be entering its final phase.
'Bonds are still a good-looking one-year play, but in 1995 total returns
will come down to below 10 per cent,' believes Mr Kokko.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Placing trust
in the directors - The portfolio, having disposed of two of its holdings
since the last Review, buys units in a fund that monitors who is buying
shares in their own company. It also responds to a reader's suggestion
</HEADLINE>

It is 10.45 am, and the post has still not arrived. I do not live in a
remote village, but less than two miles from the local delivery office.
What explanation is there for such a late service in January? I am informed
that the delay is due to 'all the junk mail. . . I wish they would stagger
their deliveries'.
Always on the lookout for investment opportunities, I contemplate searching
out and investing in companies that benefit from the ever-increasing amount
of unsolicited mail.
I mention that, in 'normal times', the post is always considerably later
than that for a neighbouring road, and that the delivery route seems
unnecessarily circuitous. Could he kindly look at the routings again?
The spokesman says he doesn't have the money or the manpower to do this, and
that the Royal Mail suffers from 'government restraints'.
Various excuses for an appalling service have also been given since I
started complaining in March 1987, when the Royal Mail said 'the slippage of
delivery times' was due to 'the unprecedented increase in mail over the past
12 months'; while in 1989 it was because of 'difficulties in retention and
recruitment of staff due to a general shrinkage in the labour market in the
south of England'.
However, this year's complaint seems to have achieved immediate results.
Within a week, the post arrived much earlier - but how long will it last?
What has any of this to do with the portfolio? It demonstrates the
importance of management action in securing the future of companies having
to operate in a competitive environment, and the need to take into account
the effects of government actions.
These considerations have all been borne in mind in producing this
portfolio. I am particularly interested in companies with strong management
and the capability of responding quickly to changing conditions and
customers' needs.
Allied Colloids (speciality chemicals) and EIS (engineering) have
demonstrated their ability to compete worldwide in the face of tough
competition. However, the portfolio will maintain its earlier stop-loss
levels of 205-210p and 365-370p respectively for these companies.
Stop-loss levels are useful for locking in profits and/or preventing large
losses. Unfortunately, when Norcros slipped to its stop-loss level of 170p,
soon after the publication of the last Review, this did not generate the
maximum profit for the portfolio, as the shares subsequently rebounded to
higher levels.
The 170p stop-loss level had been chosen, because I thought Norcros' share
price had been buoyed by takeover hopes, and these had now faded. Expecting
a general market downturn, I feared that any fall in the share price could
be quite steep. But the portfolio did make a modest profit as it had bought
the shares for 158p each.
Burlington Group fell to its stop-loss level of 20p in late November. The
shares had originally been acquired for 11.5p each in October, 1992, but
half the portfolio's holding had been sold for 27p a share in March last
year. This shows the volatility of shares in certain small companies. At 20p
a share, Burlington's market capitalisation is only Pounds 2.96m. It would
make an ideal 'shell' into which an entrepreneur could inject further
activities and rapidly expand the company.
My personal pension scheme has been buying and selling Burlington shares
since 1989, in the hope of a takeover bid, and still retains a modest
holding. If Burlington's shares fell to 16-17p, the portfolio would consider
using its surplus cash to reinvest in the company.
Thus, since the last Review, the portfolio has disposed of two of its
holdings. I had intended the proceeds to be used to buy shares in Renishaw
(a manufacturer of precision metrology and inspection equipment), OIS
International Inspection, or Meggitt, an engineering company. Sadly, the
share prices of these strongly-managed companies did not fall to my expected
buying levels, and so the portfolio was stuck with cash during a period of
low interest rates.
I still like all three companies, and, if the portfolio ever had any spare
cash, would consider buying shares in them if they fell as a result of a
general market downturn to 220-230p for Renishaw, around 80p for Meggitt and
60-65p for OIS.
Perhaps one of the best ways of making sure that a company performs is for
its management to have a large share stake. Although I have recently cooled
towards Pentland Group, its executive chairman, Stephen Rubin, has a massive
shareholding in the company. Its recent acquisition of a 90 per cent
interest in Ellesse, an upmarket sportswear company, should fit in well with
Pentland's other brands, such as Speedo swimwear and Pony shoes.
The portfolio will maintain its stop-loss level for Pentland at 80-85p. My
personal pension scheme has a holding in Pentland and in another of the
portfolio's holdings: William Ransom. I still believe Ransom is attractive,
it has sound management and its chairman has a large shareholding. The
portfolio stop-loss will be changed to 45-47p.
The importance of directors' shareholdings in companies is emphasised by
Pointon York's BRI Director Dealings unit trust. Launched at 100p per unit
in October last year, the trust aims to monitor closely share transactions
by directors in their own companies. The trust emphasises that it does not
blindly follow directors, but applies 'fundamental research techniques' to
try to ensure that any investment by the trust is as a result of following
directors who buy shares because they believe their company has significant
potential rather than the director buying mainly in an attempt to help prop
up the share price. The portfolio will 'buy' 2,500 units in this trust.
A reader of my column in the Weekend FT wrote to me in October, pointing out
that Alvis was a company that appeared to him to have been overlooked by the
market and was well worth mentioning: it not only had excellent products,
but takeover attractions, as Brierley Investments had a 29 per cent share
stake. The value of Alvis's shareholding in Avimo of Singapore was perhaps
worth as much as Alvis's own market capitalisation.
I did some further research and liked what I saw, so my personal pension
fund took a very modest stake in the company on Christmas Eve. The portfolio
will acquire 6,250 shares in Alvis at 40p per share. A stop-loss level of
30-32p will be set, as I feel this could be more of a speculation than some
of the other holdings in the portfolio.
The shares have traded in the 17-48p range since January last year. Despite
defence cuts, there seems to be no end to terrorist activities and civil
wars in various countries, and so Alvis's light armoured fighting vehicles
and robotic bomb disposal equipment still ought to find markets. Through
Avimo, Alvis has considerable interests in non-defence activities, including
providing chemical treatment processes for metal components used in computer
disk drives.
As can be seen from the chart, the portfolio has so far managed to
outperform the FT All-Share Index. But past performance is no guarantee of
future success, and I feel the market could be due for at least a minor
shake-out in the not too distant future. At least setting stop-loss levels
limits the downside.
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Doubts cast
over likely European performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual assumption that European equities will naturally stage a new-year
rally stands to be tested this year.
By December 31, the FT-Actuaries World Index series was showing Europe,
excluding the UK, up by 39.9 per cent, accelerating from a gain of 24.4 per
cent in the first nine months of 1993; and investment strategists were
counselling caution.
In that respect, they were agreeing with the helpless stance taken
throughout most of last year by fundamental analysts, who said there was no
hope of continental Europe, in the short-to-medium term, producing the
economic recovery that would lift corporate profits to the level that share
prices were demanding.
Germany, said the analysts, should not have its blue-chip DAX index valued
on a prospective 1994 p/e between 20 and 25 - depending on who did the sums
 -when its economic and corporate performance was still looking grim.
This argument had been overborne by the weight of liquidity coming into
European equity markets, and especially German equities, from the US.
US investment in overseas equities exploded in 1993. A boom in US mutual
funds was sustained throughout the year by the low level of domestic
interest rates. This, however, might be coming to an end, said Mr Albert
Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, in London, in a review in
the first week of the new year.
Mr Edwards' fears for 1994 were:
First, that US short-term rates were set to rise sharply, bringing to an end
the US liquidity-led rallies in equity markets around the world; and
Second, the realisation that recent low inflation experienced around the
world is cyclical, rather than structural, could be a serious threat to
current valuations.
He made a deep cut in his model portfolio's recommended equity asset
allocation to Europe, from 15 per cent to 8 per cent.
The American influence last year cut both ways, fast and deep. Ericsson, the
Swedish telecommunications giant, was a US favourite as recently as
mid-October, when it hit a high of SKr477. Two months later, it had dropped
to SKr311, with international investors heavy net sellers and little or no
domestic buying interest to cushion the fall. At the time, dealers said the
shares had suffered because the company's progress reports were no more than
excellent; in fact, the fall coincided with the rise of US interest-rate
fears.
Most European equities are unlikely to be affected in such a dramatic way.
Mr James Cornish, European equity strategist with NatWest Securities, notes
that his bank is moving to an underweight position for continental Europe in
its global asset allocation, with an overweight position for the UK.
However, says Mr Cornish, this reflects the feeling that the best was seen
in 1993; NatWest's projections for local currency markets in individual
markets over the next 12 months range from 5 to 12 per cent.
US flows could turn negative, he agrees, but this will be replaced by
pressure on European domestic savings to move out of money markets and bonds
into equities. 'The sums involved,' he says, ' are potentially enormous'.
However, he thinks that rallies based on this feature would be extremely
vulnerable to bad news, particularly in the bigger markets which have
already risen the most, like Germany, up 44.5 per cent last year, and
Switzerland, up 43.6 per cent.
Investors this year need a solid base, he contends, which will not become
available until economic recovery leads to visible earnings growth based on
expanding margins and sales. With UK earnings growth early in place, this
suggests a division of continental Europe into two camps.
For a group including France, Norway, Spain and perhaps Italy (depending on
the politics), economic recovery is in place, or not far away. In a group
centred on Germany, including the Netherlands and Switzerland, growth will
be weakened by low consumer confidence, restructuring is likely to continue,
and firmly-based earings recovery may well not be visible before the end of
the fall in the interest-rate cycle.

year, may not be able to defy the forces of gravity, writes Emiko Terazono,
in Tokyo.
The case for investing in emerging markets in Asia has been demonstrated by
the rapid economic growth of the south-east Asian region and China, and
increasing liquidity due to low interest rates and capital inflows from
overseas investors.
But, as markets such as Manila rose 151 per cent and Hong Kong 118 per cent
last year, cautiousness over the increased speculation in the markets has
started to prevail.
The boost during the last quarter of 1993 was provided by foreign fund
managers, especially from the US and Japan. Baring Securities estimates that
last year, a total of Dollars 38bn flowed into emerging markets in the
Pacific Rim and Latin America - double the figure for 1992. It predicts that
Dollars 45bn will flow to such markets this year, but sees US investors
switching towards Latin America.
The bottoming out of interest rates in the US points to similar
circumstances in many south-east Asian countries, where rates move in tandem
with the US. Investors may want to bet on further growth potential in the
region, but they will need to keep in mind the fact that the risk of a
correction looms.
Many analysts are downbeat on Malaysia, which, in terms of valuation, has
become the most expensive market in Asia, excluding Japan. However,
political developments may help to support stock prices, as the government
is likely to try and maintain an active stock market if it chooses to hold
an early election.
Investors in the Hong Kong market will need to weigh the risks of an
overheating Chinese economy and an expected wave of capital inflows from the
west and Japan. Meanwhile, the attractiveness of Manila will depend upon
whether the electricity porducers can solve the power crisis, and whether
the economy can post a firm recovery.
Thailand, which rose 90 per cent last year, may be threatened with a rise in
inflationary pressures in the near term. While the economy remains strong,
with firm business confidence and consumption, the central bank has warned
that it will impose a tougher monetary policy this year in order to control
overheated inflation. This could potentially hurt liquidity flows.
An increasing number of investors are starting to focus on laggard markets
in the region, namely Japan and South Korea. Expectations of economic
recovery in Japan, which underperformed, relative to Asia, last year, have
started to attract an inflow of overseas funds. A weakening yen will also
help corporate profits, along with fiscal stimulus and a substantial cut in
income tax.
South Korea has increased its competitiveness as a result of last year's
spurt in the yen, and share prices are expected to be supported by continued
economic growth.
The Taiwan market, which gained 74 per cent last year, currently stands at
about a third of its peak in 1990, and is also favoured due to expectations
of lower interest rates.
So where ought investors to be looking to place funds in Asia?
'On a risk reward basis, it's Japan,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, at Baring
Securities, in Tokyo. He believes that the risks of investing in Japan are
limited, relative to other Asian markets. Although the rewards may not be
substantial, with the upside of the Nikkei index which is currently hovering
around the 18,000 level, at 20,000, prospects for a crash are slim .
Another reason for moving out of south-east Asian stocks may be the active
purchases of those markets by Japanese investment trusts seen during the
last quarter. . . 'Buying by Japanese individuals may point to the top of
the market,' says Mr Peter Tasker, at Kleinwort Benson, in Tokyo, referring
to a similar phenomenon just before the Tokyo market crashed in early 1990.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Wall Street is
sanguine despite prospect of rise in interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US stock markets not only ended 1993 on a firm note, but also opened the
new year in an equally upbeat mood. In the final week of last year, share
prices set a series of record closing highs, and that upward momentum
spilled into the first week of 1994, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed above 3,800 for the first time ever.
Investors hoped that the strong early start to the year would prove a herald
of things to come. The consensus on Wall Street is that the stock market
should do well in the first quarter of 1994. The bullish factors supporting
stocks will be: a further improvement in corporate earnings; strengthening
economic growth; and low inflation. Also, the market should be untroubled by
an interest-rate hike from the Federal Reserve, which is more likely to come
later in the year.
If the forecasts are anywhere near on target, the first quarter should bring
better gains than investors achieved in the final quarter of 1993. In that
period, the Dow rose 5.6 per cent during the three months, to end the
quarter and the year at 3,754.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fared less well,
gaining only 1.7 per cent to 466.45, while the Nasdaq composite index firmed
1.9 per cent to 776.80.
The outperformance of the Dow during the quarter was evidence that investors
were favouring stocks that would benefit most from the accelerating pace of
economic activity - the so-called 'cyclical' stocks such as transportation
companies, paper manufacturers and carmakers. This strategy made sense,
because throughout the last three months of 1993 government statistics
consistently pointed to a rapidly improving economic climate.
While the cyclicals prospered, other sectors languished. Interest-sensitive
stocks, such as utilities, banks and securities houses, which did so well
earlier in 1993, were hit by the jump in bond-market rates. The rise in
long-term Treasury yield, which climbed from under 6 per cent to 6.4 per
cent during the quarter, stopped the broader market from matching the gains
achieved by the Dow.
The final quarter of 1993 also saw national and international politics
affect market sentiment. Concern that the North American Free Trade
Agreement might be blocked by Congress unsettled stocks briefly, before
President Clinton's last-minute lobbying effort brought home a victory.
Overseas events, notably the uprising at the Russian parliament, which
President Boris Yeltsin quashed in early October, the success of far-right
extremists in the December Russian elections, and disturbing developments in
North Korea, also kept traders and investors on their toes.
On the corporate front improved quarterly company earnings, and the
continued revival in the mergers and acquisitions business (in particular,
the prolonged bid battle for control of Paramount Communications and the
acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc by Bell Atlantic) lifted sentiment.
Both situations lured speculators to the media and telecommunications
sectors, where prices surged in anticipation of more bid activity, and
raised hopes that a buoyant M&amp;A market would support share prices in the
first quarter of 1994 and beyond.
In Canada, the dominant themes of the quarter were the general election  -
which turfed out the Conservatives and replaced them with the Liberals, but
which had little ultimate impact on investor sentiment - declining interest
rates, and the still-modest economic recovery. The result was solid gains in
share prices, with the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index climbing 8.2
per cent to end at 4,321.43.
In Mexico, the big story was Nafta. Optimism about the positive impact the
market hoped the treaty would have on the Mexican economy, combined with the
success of the government's fight against inflation, the continued huge
flows of foreign investment into the country, and investors' approval of the
ruling party's nomination of Luis Colosio as its presidential candidate, all
helped the Prices and Quotations Index post a 41 per cent increase during
the quarter to 2,602.63.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Cash in hand
will ensure flexibility - Where will investment opportunities arise this
year?  Analysts do not expect a re-run of 1993. Some see Japan as a good
buy, but are less clear about Europe and the UK
</HEADLINE>

So what does the investor do for an encore? Last year was a real
rollercoaster on world stock markets, and those many fund managers who sat
on their hands - and their profits - at the end of the third quarter of 1993
missed out on the massive bull run in most markets during the run-up to
Christmas and the new year.
Just to get the facts out of the way: the world, as measured by the FT
Actuaries World Index, advanced in sterling terms by more than 25 per cent,
and a little less for dollar-based investors. This global return concealed a
relatively weak performance on Wall Street, where the return in dollars (9.6
per cent) was the smallest for any of the 24 markets surveyed. It also
averaged out some spectacular results in such markets as Malaysia (136 per
cent) and Hong Kong (134 per cent). No single market ended in negative
ground.
Japan outperformed Wall Street by a couple of percentage points, measured in
local currency, but the strength of the yen gave sterling-based investors a
total return, including re-invested income, of almost 28 per cent. The
Pacific region, excluding Japan, produced a remarkable near-doubling of
returns over the full year; Europe, excluding the UK, yielded 36 per cent;
the UK itself showed an advance of 26.7 per cent.
The question now is: where will the markets go from here? Most analysts
viewing the new old year were agreed that it was too much to ask for a
re-run in 1994; and the first trading days in January did see some
significant setbacks among last year's star performers, with Malaysia and
Hong Kong each down by some 6 per cent in a matter of days. On the other
hand, Wall St continued to hit new highs, despite the growing conviction
that the US Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates will be upwards.
Interest rates, coupled with low levels of inflation and only modest, or no,
growth in the main western economies, are the uncertain (and unusual in
recent investment cycles) backdrop to the current year. Yet history, even
including the 1987 markets crash, still shows that, over time, equities
outperform most other investments; and mainstream analysts are sticking with
that view. Even though their conviction at the start of 1994 appeared to
have waned just a fraction, it is still generally bullish.
Could there be a sea-change around the corner? Some analysts think this
could happen in the front-running emerging markets, especially in the
Pacific rim. But on Japan itself there continue to be hopes of even lower
interest rates, tax cuts and a further massive injection of infrastructure
spending, albeit by a politically uncertain government. A declining yen,
fervently hoped for by Japanese exporters, would help the share price of
high-technology companies; and Nomura Securities thinks Japan is a good bet
for 1994. The firm has increased its investment exposure there, mainly at
the expense of Australia, Canada and Hong Kong.
But if many global investment funds see Tokyo as 'cheap' at the moment (it
is still more than 50 per cent below its all-time high, achieved at the end
of 1989), managers are less clear - and more divided - over Europe,
including the UK, and also about the high multiples on Wall Street.
Europe surged ahead by almost one-third last year (Germany by 41 per cent,
Switzerland by almost 48 per cent, both in sterling terms) and some
investment weightings there are being reduced by British fund managers; but
not so far by most of the highly-liquid large American houses, with the
notable and well-publicised exception of Morgan Stanley
Staying slightly overweight in cash may not give much immediate return, but
it does provide flexibility to exploit particular opportunities; and the
bond markets at the longer end are beginning to look attractive, against a
low-inflation environment. Taking a little profit from the 1993 bonanza
could be no bad thing.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): London's
worries re-emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sun shone on the London stock market in the final quarter of 1993, and a
successful year was rounded off by a spectacular burst of strength over the
Christmas period.
In terms of total return, the FT-SE 100 Share Index, London's favoured
yardstick, returned 13.3 per cent for the quarter, making 25.2 per cent for
the year.
Relative weakness in Japan and the US was significant, because UK equities
benefited from inflows of international investment cash. US mutual funds, in
particular, saw London as an attractive investment target.
London's advance can be ascribed clearly to growing confidence that an era
of low domestic inflation and interest rates has begun. Economic recovery,
although somewhat hesitant, is perceived to have taken hold, taking the UK
to 'a more advanced stage in the economic cycle than the continental
European economies,' as NatWest Securities, the investment arm of the UK
bank, has it.
A moment of doubt was suffered in the market towards the end of November,
when some analysts feared that the new chancellor might raise taxes and thus
threaten economic recovery.
Such fears proved premature. Tax rises have, in effect, been put off until
the spring, when Social Security, VAT and mortgage tax adjustments will
revive the market's old fears. Just ahead of the Budget, the stock market
was also granted its base-rate cut, whereupon it immediately began to
discount the next one.
The outlook for the this year remains optimistic, although the exceptionally
vigorous December performance has brought a cautious reaction. On the
economic front, prospects are not greatly different from last year. And
there are no serious political worries, because the government has plenty of
time in which to recover its standing in the opinion polls.
The driving force for the London market has been the huge outflow of US
investment funds, which had already reached about Dollars 75bn by the end of
the third quarter. Much of this went into European, but also Pacific Rim,
markets. London benefited, both directly (from its share of the US funds)
and indirectly (because the City is the financial channel through which many
international fund flows reach continental European markets).
These US outflows could well fall, or change direction, this year, if only
because both Wall Street and Tokyo are likely to improve their relative
performances. Also, London was briefly upset before Christmas by fears that
the Federal Reserve might be obliged to push US interest rates up to curb
the economic rebound.
The possibility of higher, rather than lower, rates has already begun to
trouble the UK. While conventional long-dated UK government bonds returned
34.4 per cent last year, index-linked gilts gave a return of 20.6 per cent,
indicating that not all the fears of inflation have been laid to rest.
This combination - uneasiness over inflationary pressures, and doubts about
whether last year's cash inflows can be repeated - lies behind analysts'
predictions for this year. Most expect further progress in the short term,
with a further cut in base rates providing the encouragement.
Valuations on UK equities continue to discount a great deal of optimim for
economic recovery. The optimists would remind us that 'Bull markets climb a
wall of worry', but others would prefer to see the next round of corporate
results. Confidence in the depth of the recovery in the UK economy has still
to be fully justified, and any doubts could bring a correction in share
prices.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): No nasty late
surprises - Year-end tax planning / A November Budget leaves time for
thought. And investment decisions should not be based on tax-saving alone,
lest you lose more than you save
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
For the first time, investors can plan their end-of-tax-year finances
without the fear that last-minute surprises will pop out of the chancellor's
budget briefcase.
These were unleashed in November, and investors will have had plenty of time
to digest the effects by the end of the tax year.
However, John Cole, at Berry Birch and Noble, independent financial
advisers, warns against leaving action until the last minute: 'The mad
scramble to make financial decisions at the end of the tax year is to be
avoided. Better to plan ahead and make decisions at a more leisurely pace
during the year.'
It is also worth remembering that no tax-planning measure should be based
solely on the amount of tax which might be saved. If the underlying
investment is not sound, investors will lose much more than any potential
tax saving. The main areas are:
Income tax
Those who are happily married should make use of all personal allowances,
and transfer assets to the lower-rate taxpayer to avoid paying higher-rate
tax on them. James Higgins, of fee-based adviser Chamberlain de Broe, says:
'This is particularly important for older couples, where age allowance can
be reduced or lost by having too much income arising in the wrong name. For
example, people should watch out for maturing guaranteed income bonds.'
The married couple's allowance is automatically allocated to the husband.
Tax relief will be restricted to only 20 per cent in the 1994-95 tax year,
instead of up to 40 per cent, so there is no longer any point in
transferring the whole allowance to the wife unless the husband is a
non-taxpayer. An election for a transfer or split must be made before the
end of this tax year for 1994-95.
Frank Akers-Douglas, of chartered accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, reminds
parents that their children each have a personal allowance of Pounds 3,445
for the current tax year, and advises parents to use them up; for example,
through distributions from non-parental discretionary trusts.
Non-taxpayers with building society accounts should register before the end
of the tax year in order to receive the whole of next tax year's building
society interest gross.
Capital gains tax
Everyone has a CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800 in the current tax year. The
abolition of indexation to increase or create losses from Budget day will
have deprived many investors of the ability to reduce their CGT bill, while
others will face a bill which they might otherwise have escaped.
However, those who would like to reinvest gains in an unquoted trading
company can roll over their CGT liability by doing so. Otherwise, investors
should try to 'bed-and-breakfast' shares by selling them one day and buying
them back the next, to use up their annual exemption. There are costs
involved - broker's commission and stamp duty - so it is important to
calculate whether these outweigh the benefits. Crystallising gains by
selling and buying back shares will reduce a future CGT bill, because a
higher base will have been established.
Cole says: 'As an alternative to bed-and-breakfasting, many people are now
bed-and-pepping - selling shares and repurchasing within the tax-free
environment of a personal equity plan on a self-select basis.' This is only
suitable for those who have not already used up their annual Pep allowance
(see Investments, below).
Akers-Douglas advises against selling an asset with a large gain near the
end of the tax year. By deferring the sale until after April 5, the tax will
be delayed for a further 12 months.
Since CGT is payable at an investor's marginal rate, Cole suggests creating
gains in a spouse's name, if the spouse is in the lower-rate tax band, by
transferring the assets to them first.
Inheritance tax
IHT is not payable on the first Pounds 150,000 of someone's estate when they
die. An individual can limit their estate to this figure by giving away
their wealth, but such gifts will be 'potentially exempt transfers' unless
the donor survives for seven years.
However, annual gifts of up to Pounds 3,000 are not dependent on this time
restriction. The relief can be carried forward for one year only, so a
married couple could collectively give away Pounds 12,000 without any IHT
liability.
In addition, someone can make limitless small gifts of up to Pounds 250 (but
not more than Pounds 250 to any single individual).
Value Added Tax
Fuel bills will increase from April 1, when VAT at 8 per cent is imposed,
but the tax can be avoided by buying the year's domestic fuel in advance.
This is because VAT is charged at the rate that applies at the date of
invoice or payment, whichever is earlier.
Pensions
Pensions are highly tax-efficient, since premiums are grossed up and are
invested in a tax-free fund. However, benefits cannot be drawn until
retirement.
Those with a personal pension can use 'carry back' provisions, allowing them
to mop up unused tax relief from any of the last six tax years, which is
particularly useful for self-employed people with fluctuating annual
earnings.
'If someone wants to reduce his or her 1992-93 income tax bill, a
contribution must be made before April 5,' said Higgins. 'The investor then
has until July 5 before making the election to carry back. Some people
confuse these two dates - the payment must actually be made before the year
end for it to be carried back to the previous year.'
Those in a company pension scheme, who are eligible to a top up, can do so
with additional voluntary contributions. Unused reliefs cannot be swept up
in later years, so the maximum contribution into an AVC must be made by the
end of this tax year.
Investments
A personal equity plan allows investors to hold shares, investment or unit
trusts investing in UK and other EC equities, free of income tax and CGT.
The investment limits are Pounds 6,000 a tax year into a general Pep, and
another Pounds 3,000 into a single-company Pep. Those wanting to invest the
maximum must do so before the end of the tax year, but charges on a Pep tend
to make them most worthwhile only to a higher-rate taxpayer.
The Business Expansion Scheme, which allowed full income and CGT relief on
an annual investment of Pounds 40,000, has been replaced by the less
generous Enterprise Investment Scheme. This gives tax relief of 20 per cent
on a maximum investment of Pounds 100,000 in a qualifying trading company.
The final legislation will not be in place until the Finance Bill receives
royal assent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): New inflation
rule will disrupt many plans - The Budget / The change to CGT took effect in
the middle of the tax year - to the disadvantage of investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The principle that investors should not have to pay tax on inflationary
gains was eroded by the Budget. Since budget day, it has no longer been
possible to use indexation to create a capital loss, although it will still
be possible to use indexation to reduce gains.
Under the old system, if you bought an asset for Pounds 10,000, and then
sold it, after prices had risen by 50 per cent, for Pounds 10,000, you would
have had an indexation loss of Pounds 5,000. This will no longer be the
case. You will still be able to offset losses in nominal value - ie, if you
bought an asset for Pounds 10,000 and sold it for Pounds 5,000, that would
be an allowable loss.
This change may upset many people's tax planning. Take an investor with two
assets, each worth Pounds 100,000. After five years, asset A has doubled in
value to Pounds 200,000, while asset B's price has not changed. Meanwhile,
prices have risen by 50 per cent.
The total value of the investor's portfolio has risen to Pounds 300,000, or
by 50 per cent, exactly keeping pace with inflation. Under the old system,
the investor would have no CGT liability, since the indexed gain on Asset A
of Pounds 50,000 would be offset by the indexed loss on Asset B of Pounds
50,000.
Under the new system, there will be no indexed loss on Asset B. So the
investor will have to pay CGT on his indexed Asset A gain of Pounds 50,000.
With the current allowance of Pounds 5,800, a higher-rate taxpayer would
face a bill for Pounds 17,680.
What has particularly upset many readers is that the change applied from
budget day, in the middle of a tax year. Investors who had already realised
gains of more than Pounds 5,800 might have planned to sell other investments
(for indexation losses) in order to realise an indexed loss. They will now
be prevented from doing so.
One beneficial change to the CGT rules will allow investors to roll over
gains (ie defer the payment of tax), if the proceeds are reinvested in the
shares of an unquoted trading company. This may yet develop into a large
loophole in the CGT regulations; however, an investor with a large gain
from, say, Glaxo shares may prefer to pay the tax, than take the risk of
buying shares in an unquoted company.
Income Tax
While the chancellor did not alter the headline rates of income tax, he did
increase the burden of the tax in various subtle ways.
The personal allowance, and the higher rate band, were frozen at Pounds
3,445 and Pounds 23,700 respectively. Since wage inflation gradually draws
more and more people into the tax net, and into the higher rate band,
freezing allowances effectively represents a tax increase.
The married couple's allowance (for those under 65) was frozen at Pounds
1,720. Furthermore, tax relief on the allowance which was already scheduled
to fall to 20 per cent in 1994-95, will drop again, to 15 per cent, in
1995-6. This costs a higher-rate taxpayer Pounds 344 and Pounds 86 in
succeeding years; for basic rate taxpayers, the cost will be Pounds 86 each
year.
Such changes might make it seem as if the married couple's allowance is
doomed to disappear. However, the allowance was increased for those over 65.
The only other piece of good income tax news in the Budget was the rise in
the blind person's allowance from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds 1,200. The increase
in the 20 per cent band (from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000) had already been
announced by Norman Lamont.
Miras
One 'dog that didn't bark' in the Budget was the abolition of mortgage
interest relief. The chancellor evidently felt that abolishing the relief
would do too much damage to the fragile housing market. Nevertheless,
Kenneth Clarke continued the old Treasury policy of allowing the relief to
'wither on the vine' and, indeed, added an extra spurt of weedkiller.
Relief, which will be restricted to 20 per cent in 1994-95, will be further
restricted to 15 per cent in 1995-96.
The Treasury decided that restricting the rate of relief was fairer than
reducing the size of loan on which relief was granted (from Pounds 30,000
to, say, Pounds 25,000). The latter option, the Treasury argues, would hit
those with larger loans, where the debt problems are worst.
New taxes
Mr Clarke may not have extended the VAT base, as many feared, but he did
find new items to tax. From October, general insurance premiums (such as on
house contents or motor cars) will carry a 3 per cent tax. The reaction of
insurance companies varied, but it seems inevitable that the charge will
eventually be passed on to the consumer. Long-term life insurance policies
(such as endowments) are exempt.
Air travel will also be taxed; flights within the European Union bearing a
Pounds 5 charge, and outside the EU Pounds 10. This tax will also apply from
October.
Private medical insurance
Tax relief on medical insurance for the elderly is another relief which is
being restricted, although to 25 per cent, rather than 20 or 15 per cent.
Medical insurance premiums will also suffer the new 3 per cent tax.
Another cutback is the change in the tax treatment of permanent health
insurance benefits. These will now be tax-free for the first 12 months,
rather than for the first tax year. Under the old rules, if someone started
to take PHI benefits in May, they could receive them tax-free for 23 months.
Retirement for women
As expected, the government is extending the state retirement age for women
from 60 to 65. This both meets the requirement for sex equality and, what is
more important, saves the government money. Ageing populations mean that a
number of western countries are extending retirement ages.
The change will be phased in between 2010 and 2020, affecting those women
currently aged under 44. The cut-off date is April 5, 1950. Women born on
that date will be paid a pension at age 60. Those born thereafter will see
their retirement age increase by a month, for every month they were born
after April 5, 1950. So those born in May 1950, can retire at 60 years and
one month; those born in June 1950 can retire at 60 years and two months;
and so on. Those born after April 1955 will retire at age 65.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Where low
overheads spell value for money - Investing offshore, building societies /
UK tax reform means that the advantages to savers are fewer, but bargains
are still available to those who plan carefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
Building societies are redolent with security. Trust in these worthy
institutions is embedded deep in the British psyche.
'Offshore', on the other hand, is regarded with the deepest suspicion.
Mainly as a result of affairs such as Barlow Clowes, off-shore tax havens
seem to be havens for crooks and frauds.
Consequently investors are often a little perplexed to know why building
societies have dipped into such apparently murky waters.
But hard work by the financial authorities on the UK's three main 'offshore'
centres - Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man - has cut down on the level
of financial crime. Meanwhile, UK legislation means that offshore building
societies are as 'secure' in the event of the society failing as their
parent companies on the mainland.
In the event of collapse, the 1986 Building Societies Act requires the
parents societies to guarantee 100 per cent of the liabilities of its
offshore subsidiary, with no ceiling on the amount payable to individual
savers.
No building societies have collapsed this century, so the issue should be
academic, but this is actually stronger compensation than is available on
the mainland - where the statutory compensation scheme would pay out 90 per
cent of the deposit, up to a maximum of Pounds 18,000 per person. The Isle
of Man also has its own investor-protection scheme.
So there is no great reason why investors should avoid offshore building
society accounts. A more relevant question is: 'Why bother?' Recent reforms
of the UK taxation system have made this rather tougher to answer.
The big 'plus' of offshore financial centres is that funds are free of tax,
allowing interest to be paid gross. When 'composite rate tax' was levied on
all UK bank and building society accounts, irrespective of what level of
income tax the account-holder paid, this gave offshore accounts a great
attraction. Non-taxpayers could avoid losing more than a fifth of their
income, just by placing their funds off-shore. The introduction of
independent taxation for husbands and wives gave the offshore societies a
further boost, as couples took advantage of the new tax-planning
opportunities.
Now, interest is payable gross on onshore accounts for non-taxpayers.
Further, interest earned offshore is still taxable for those liable to tax
on onshore accounts. The offshore accounts have therefore lost their old
financial advantage.
However, the societies point out that opportunities for financial planning
still exist, because tax on interest earned does not have to be paid
immediately. Careful planning should allow investors to earn extra interest
before they finally pay tax - an option not available onshore.
The offshore societies also compete on two other factors - service, and
value-for-money.
All of these societies are small one-branch operations, with low overheads
as a result. Most of their business is postal, as the vast majority of their
customers are not resident on the islands.
All the three main offshore centres have developed a small financial
industry, ensuring that all can recruit experienced staff. Thus, they hope
to be both swift and efficient.
The low overheads should also allow them to compete on price with their
mainland rivals, who must offer a wider range of products, and maintain a
costly branch network.
Comparisons of some leading societies' onshore and offshore rates, using
figures drawn from the January edition of Moneyfacts, suggest that there is
strength in this argument.
For example, the Alliance &amp; Leicester offers 4.60 per cent on an instant
access account with a balance of at least Pounds 50,000 on the mainland.
Offshore, the 'Manximum' instant access account offers 6.0 per cent for the
same balance.
On balances of Pounds 100,000, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Channel Islands'
Guernsey Gold account will offer 6.2 per cent, compared with 4.0 per cent on
the society's equivalent Cheltenham Gold instant access account and 5.7 per
cent on the postal London Share account.
Derbyshire's Isle of Man account offers 7.00 per cent on instant access for
balances of Pounds 50,000, compared with the maximum of 5.00 per cent
available from the society on the mainland.
However, offshore bargains like this need to be searched for carefully. Many
other societies, such as the Halifax, make little or no difference between
the rates available offshore and on the mainland.
The very top rates at any one time, for those prepared to shop around using
the Weekend FT's Highest Rates for Your Money table, compiled by Moneyfacts,
are usually roughly comparable, with neither onshore nor offshore accounts
having an overall advantage.
Expatriates stand to gain the most from offshore accounts. The societies are
geared to their needs in any case, but, most important, onshore building
societies are now getting nervous about paying interest gross to
expatriates, for fear of falling foul of the Inland Revenue if their
customers return to the UK. This makes offshore accounts much more
administratively simple for the expatriate Briton.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Tax deferred
may be tax saved - Investing offshore, roll-up funds / The chief reason for
using such funds is the expectation that you will one day be in a lower
income tax bracket - say, on retirement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Offshore roll-up funds may have lost some of their investor appeal in
today's low-interest-rate environment, but they remain valuable financial
planning tools for those who want to accumulate income and to defer their
tax liability.
Roll-up funds provide investors with exactly the benefit that their name
suggests. Income and capital gains are retained and rolled-up within the
fund. Investors are only liable to tax when they withdraw their money.
The funds offer a number of investment benefits and tax-planning
opportunities, therefore, and, unlike some offshore investment vehicles,
they have clear advantages for UK, as well as overseas, investors.
Roll-up funds are invariably based in favourable tax environments, so
investors enjoy the gross accumulation of interest and dividends, and money
that would be lost to tax each year in a UK account continues to earn
interest, giving a further investment boost.
But the most significant planning benefit is investors' ability to defer the
payment of tax. Nick Smith, marketing director of Guinness Flight, says:
'The main reason why roll-up funds are still of interest to UK investors is
that they can basically decide at what point they want to be taxed.'
Graham Barker, executive director of Fidelity Investments, agrees: 'The
whole benefit occurs because you can choose when to make the realisation,
and therefore when to pay the tax. And you can avoid tax completely if you
are by then non-resident or go to work abroad. So investors have nothing to
lose, and everything to gain.'
Jeremy Norfolk, managing director of Cater Allen, which plans to launch a
roll-up fund later this year, adds: 'The other related advantage is that you
can effectively take the same income out of a roll-up fund by selling
shares, but you only pay income tax on the capital gain made by the shares.'
David Major, personal finance partner of the accountancy firm Touche Ross,
'uses roll-up funds a lot for people who do a considerable amount of work
overseas. After enjoying a gross roll up, they can redeem the funds when
they are not resident in the UK for tax purposes.'
Certainly, the chief reason for placing money in a roll-up fund is the
expectation that the investor will be liable to lower rates of income tax at
some future date. Obvious candidates for the funds, therefore, are those who
are currently higher-rate taxpayers but who reckon that their tax position
will change when they retire, either because they will have less income, or
because they anticipate retiring abroad and will thus escape any UK tax
bill.
UK employees who know that their career may take them abroad at some time
can also make good use of a roll-up fund. If they withdraw cash when
overseas, they will not be liable for UK tax. Conversely, temporary
residents or workers in the UK can put money offshore in a roll-up fund
until they move elsewhere.
Roll-up funds also provide financial planning opportunities within the
family. For example, parents are normally liable to tax on any income
arising from money that they have given to their under-age unmarried
children. But if this cash is kept in a roll-up fund until the child is 18,
the accumulated interest can then be set against the child's own personal
allowance. Similarly, a roll-up fund can be used to mop up the personal tax
allowance of a non-working or low-income spouse.
Elsewhere, roll-up funds can be a useful aid for UK companies (or for the
self-employed), if they want to defer tax on investment income. Barker
comments: 'If a family business plans to relocate or expand in two years
time, and it knows that it will then make a trading loss, that will be the
year to redeem the roll-up fund investment.'
Most roll-up funds are cash-based, but there are some equity and bond funds.
For instance, the Guinness Flight International Accumulation Fund is a
roll-up umbrella vehicle with five bond funds and two equity funds among its
sub funds.
Donald Elkin, a director of financial adviser Wilfred T. Fry, says there are
a number of circumstances where equity-based roll-up funds are helpful:
'There is no taxable event until you make a realisation; so if you are only
resident in the UK for a couple of years, you could shelter your equity
investments in a roll-up. Conversely, if you were going to Hong Kong, say,
in two years time, and you wanted to make an equity investment, you could
anticipate your departure.'
Most UK investors use roll-up funds that invest either in a single currency
or in a managed currency vehicle, however. Richard Roberts, marketing
manager of Barclays International Funds, comments: 'Single currency funds
are one step removed from deposit accounts, and the main driving force is
the interest rate. Managed currency funds are a further step up the risk
spectrum, because returns are dependent on the manager's skill.'
The deferral of tax is not the only reason for investing in a roll-up
currency fund, as Graham Barker points out: 'There are two major uses for
roll-up funds - currency management and tax planning. If you want to pay the
bills on a holiday home in Spain, I defy anyone to find a better way to do
it than through a money fund. You escape the banks' commission and
electronic charging fees. Transfers at Fidelity are at unbeatable rates of
exchange, and we cover 23 separate currencies.'
Enthusiasm for roll-up funds has been muted of late, however. John Stephens,
investment director of Hill Samuel Jersey, says: 'The problem is that, with
interest rates so low, the returns are pretty meagre. The tax tail can start
to wag the dog when interest rates are at these levels.'
One suspects, too, that modest investors remain wary about placing money
offshore, and nervous of the Inland Revenue's future intentions. The answer
to the first worry is to stick to a household name. The pedigree of many of
the financial institutions that offer roll-up funds is impeccable. Touche
Ross's David Major says: 'It is a very competitive market. We are looking at
all the major players.'
For example, Rothschild Asset Management has Pounds 1.3bn invested in its
two Guernsey-based money funds. The major part is invested in its roll-up
vehicle, the Old Court International Reserves fund.
Most managers also feel that roll-up funds have ceased to be an Inland
Revenue target, as the two glaring loopholes have already been closed. It is
no longer possible to convert income into capital gains for tax purposes or
to switch within an umbrella fund without triggering a chargeable event.
'There is no word that the Inland Revenue is looking at roll-up funds,' says
Major. 'While you could say that a deferred tax is a saved tax, in strict
terms there is no Revenue loss.'
Happily, the Revenue appears to agree. Roll-up funds were not touched in the
November Budget.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): 'Now look for
yield rather than capital gain' - Investing offshore, bond funds / Anyone
who invested three or four years ago has been rewarded. But the climate is
changing
</HEADLINE>

Since they can receive the income gross, UK resident non-taxpayers derive
the clearest advantage from offshore bond funds.
Unlike banks and building societies, onshore bond funds have to pay the
income net of basic-rate tax, which means that UK resident non-taxpayers
have to go through the rigmarole of reclaiming tax back from the Inland
Revenue. (From the beginning of the 1994-95 tax year, however, UK-based bond
funds will be able to pay income gross to non-UK residents.)
Even resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may find offshore bond
funds attractive, because of the potential for delaying payment of the final
tax bill.
Anyone who invested in bonds three or four years ago, in anticipation of
declining interest rates, will have locked into relatively high fixed rates
and enjoyed the additional bonus of strong capital performance.
The tables list the performance of offshore sterling fixed-interest funds.
The figures may, at first glance, look surprisingly high. This is because
they are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis, instead of offer-to-bid as is
usually the case. Some offshore funds have a bid-offer spread (as in the
UK), while others have a single price but add on an initial charge. If all
the funds were quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds
would receive an unfair advantage.
However, the effect of quoting on an offer-to-offer basis is that the
performance figures are inflated; and the returns which would actually have
been achieved by an investor will have been lower.
Many of the funds invest in sterling-denominated Eurobonds - bonds issued
outside the domestic market of the issuer. Barclays Sterling bond fund,
which heads the three-year table and is managed by BZW, the securities arm
of Barclays, has a 70 per cent holding in Eurosterling issues, with the rest
invested in gilts.
The fund also has the highest yield of those listed, but Anita Higgins, fund
manager, warns that the yield may be cut back a little in the future. 'Over
the last year the fund has had high-yielding bonds, but we will not maintain
income at the expense of capital; so if the gilt market levels out over the
next couple of years, we may cut the income a bit.'
The other fund with a noticeably high yield is John Govett's GSI UK High
Income fund. Some 75 per cent of its holdings are in UK Eurosterling bonds,
most of which are 10-year bonds. About 25 per cent is held outside the UK in
Italian government bonds, high-yielding Mexican paper and Swedish bonds, the
last in expectation of falls in Swedish interest rates.
The two funds which top the one-year table are both from the same stable -
Guinness Flight - but are very different in character. The Accumulation
Sterling High Yield bond fund is a roll-up fund (see opposite page), aimed
primarily at investors wishing to delay their tax bill until they fall into
a lower-rate band. The much larger Global Strategy Gilt and Sterling bond
fund is a distributor fund, which pays out income quarterly.
Can investors looking to gains as well as income expect the same performance
in the next few years as in the past? Peter Jones, director of Hill Samuel
Investment Management, believes that the best performance is now over, and
that investors should concentrate on yield rather than capital gain.
'At the beginning of 1991 longer dated gilts were yielding 10.25 per cent
but are now down to 6.5 per cent. This size of fall in yields is very
unlikely to be repeated. A second element of performance has been the
narrowing of the premium which non-government sterling bonds had over gilt
yields. These yield spreads have roughly halved over the same period. Again,
this is unlikely to be repeated.'
Simon Osborne, fund manager of the Govett UK High Income fund, sees scope
for capital gains in some areas, such as Sweden and Italy, but agrees that
in general the UK cannot deliver the same level of returns.
Many investors may be concerned about the security of investing in a bond
fund that is situated offshore. Some offshore funds, which appear at the
back of the FT in the Managed Funds section, do so under the heading
'SIB-recognised'. This means that the Securities and Investments Board, the
UK's main financial services regulator, has accepted that regulation in that
centre is of an equivalent standard to that in the UK. The tables list only
those funds which are SIB-recognised.
Charges tend to be similar to onshore bond funds. The Guinness Flight funds
have an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual 0.75 per cent annual.
Govett also has a 5 per cent initial charge, but the annual fee is 1 per
cent. The initial charge on the Hill Samuel and Barclays funds are lower at
3.5 per cent, and the annual fees are 0.875 per cent and 0.85 per cent
respectively.
Investors should note that, unlike onshore funds, where the standard
practice is to deduct the annual fee against income, offshore funds are
allowed to charge the fee against capital. Both Barclays and John Govett
implement the latter practice, allowing them to deliver a higher yield than
would otherwise be possible. However, investors who fear capital erosion as
a result, should note carefully their chosen fund's practice before making
an investment.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A little
life-cover lends privilege - Investing offshore, single-premium insurance
bonds / Since the bond has been turned into a life insurance vehicle, the
income or gains are judged to belong to the bond rather than the individual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Nimble-footed investors make some of their best gains by switching in and
out of world stock markets when they are at their most volatile.
In order to shelter these profits from the taxman, an increasing number are
making use of offshore single-premium insurance bonds. In fact, the bonds
have become so popular that the Pounds 2bn market is expected to double in
size over the next two years as more life insurance companies jump on to the
bandwagon.
The big attraction of offshore single-premium insurance bonds is that
investors can switch between the individual life company's offshore funds
without crystalising any tax charge and, generally speaking, accumulate
income and gains tax-free.
These fiscal privileges are allowed, because the bond has been turned into a
life insurance vehicle, and therefore the income or gains are judged to
belong to the bond rather than the individual. In reality, the life-cover
element is usually only a nominal 1 per cent of the investment premium.
Clive Cowdery, managing director of the Dublin-based J. Rothschild
International, describes the offshore single-premium bond as a protective
wrapper around a collection of funds.
He adds: 'Many investors want to reposition their portfolios and switch the
geographic weightings in the light of changing circumstances. But the
prospect of having to pay tax on the gains every time acts as a deterrent,
and tax therefore plays a part in what should be a pure investment decision.
Hence the offshore insurance bond.'
There is another important tax break attached to the offshore bond. Cowdery
explains: 'The Inland Revenue extends certain UK tax privileges to policies
issued from offshore centres such as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands,
Dublin and Luxembourg. Under the 5 per cent rule, investors can withdraw 5
per cent of the initial value of the bond 'income' tax free. For instance,
if the capital investment was Pounds 100,000 the investor could take Pounds
5,000 a year. The 5 per cent concession can be carried forward over a number
of tax years, and this is a particular advantage to those who have not yet
retired.'
The choice and range of offshore funds available varies between life
companies, and the minimum investment is generally around Pounds 100,000. J.
Rothschild International, for example, offers its own in-house range of 22
unit-linked funds, and investors are allowed up to 20 free switches a year.
Other insurance companies in the offshore single-bond market, such as
Clerical Medical, Eagle Star and AXA Equity &amp; Law, also offer their own in-
house funds.
Other offshore bond providers, such as Royal Life and Royal Skandia, tend to
use third-party fund managers. The Isle of Man-based Royal Life, which has
more than Pounds 600m invested in single-premium bonds, offers a choice of
60 funds from investment houses that include Jardine Fleming, Barings,
Gartmore, Fidelity and GT.
As far as UK residents are concerned, Royal Life actuary Gary Boal comments:
'We would never promote offshore single-premium bonds on the grounds that
the tax breaks are better than those available with Tessas or personal
equity plans. But they do offer a compromise, because they provide exposure
to a mixture of cash, equity, bond and currency funds.'
According to Boal, the fastest area of growth for the life companies selling
offshore single-premium bonds is the expatriate market. 'Very often,' he
says, 'these people work in a tax-free environment and have accumulated a
sizeable chunk of capital. That is particularly true of the Far East. Hong
Kong is probably the biggest single market for these bonds.
'The appeal is that the lump-sum investments can be transferred from any
particular country in the world under the protective umbrella of the bond.
This is a great comfort factor to those investors who live in politically
sensitive regions.'
However, many of the bonds sold in the expatriate market are not, as is
common, based on the pooled investment fund principle, but rather used as a
shelter for an investor's own personal portfolio of shares.
Although most life companies allow free switching between in-house pooled
funds for lump-sum investments of Pounds 10,000 or more, there are
inevitably charges involved. But, says Boal: 'Royal Life, in common with
most of our competitors, has spread the up-front charges over a period of up
to five years, rather than deducting the full amount straight away.' In some
cases the initial charges can be as high as 7 per cent.
But, no matter how attractive the tax breaks may seem, the offshore
single-premium insurance bond is not a suitable investment vehicle for
everybody.
Andrew Jones, a director of the David Aaron Partnership, a firm of
independent financial advisers, argues:
'This is a specialised and sophisticated area of tax planning, and investors
must seek advice first. The tax breaks may be common to all of these bonds,
but it is just as important to pick the particular company with a range of
funds best suited to individual needs, and one which one has a consistent
performance track record. That said, those bonds which are based on pooled
investment funds can be just as effective for UK residents seeking to
mitigate income, capital gains and Inheritance Tax liabilities as they are
for expatriates.'
Finally, Jones also advises caution to UK residents tempted to use a
personalised bond, as opposed to one linked to a pooled fund. He points out:
'The Inland Revenue has laid down some very strict guidelines on their use.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Safer than it
used to be - Investing offshore, introduction / The Budget made one helpful
tax change, but most Britons do not see the point of going offshore. On this
page and the next three, we consider some of the possibilities

The UK is still perceived as a reluctant member of the European Union, and
the field of offshore investment is no exception.
European efforts to encourage funds to be sold across national borders, via
the Ucits (undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities)
are making only slow progress. According to Robert Fleming, while 4,500
Ucits funds have been authorised, fewer than 250 are registered in more than
one country.
Whereas, there are some signs of cross-border shifts - the amount of German
money managed by mutual funds in Luxembourg is now larger than that in
Germany itself - the UK has been particularly recalcitrant. According to
Steen Steincke, managing director (retail) for Robert Fleming Europe: 'Very
few foreign groups have tried to cross-sell into the UK from European bases,
and those that have tried have had limited success. Why is this? Perhaps
because the UK is a relatively mature, very competitive market-place with
high levels of compliance supervision. These factors make entry costs very
high.'
Nor, given their peculiar structure (involving three sets of published
prices), is there much sign of UK funds being sold overseas. 'Although most
UK unit trusts have actually registered as Ucits funds, they remain as
virtually domestic market products' says Steincke.
Perhaps the most important factor dissuading Britons from investing offshore
is that, for most people, the advantages are far from clear. If it is tax
efficiency you want, you can invest Pounds 9,000 in personal equity plans
each year (Pounds 18,000 for a married couple), and receive all income and
capital gains tax-free. Only a limited number of people have sums greater
than that to throw around.
But Kenneth Clarke's Budget did make one tax change that could give offshore
funds an advantage. The Inland Revenue decided to close a loophole which
would have allowed cash unit trusts to deduct tax at 20 per cent, giving
them an advantage over building societies, which take off tax at 25 per
cent.
However, the Revenue decided that all unit trusts would henceforth pay tax
at 25 per cent. According to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds (Autif), these proposals would mean that 'foreign dividends received
by UK trusts will be taxed at 25 per cent, while the credit for the tax paid
will be restricted to 20 per cent. If basic-rate taxpayers invest direct in
overseas equities, or though an offshore fund, they will only pay tax at 20
per cent.'
Thus, there will be a 5 per cent tax saving for basic-rate taxpayers
investing offshore. It seems likely that this loophole will be exploited
most by non-Pep qualifying funds, such as those investing in the US.
Another recent initiative might also change matters. Charles Schwab, the US
discount broker, has launched a version of its 'no-load' service. Investors
can buy a range of funds without any initial charge, a saving of up to 5-6
per cent.
For the moment, the service is limited to just three fund management groups:
Guinness Flight, Wright Investor Services and Rothschild Asset Management.
Furthermore, the only Rothschild funds available are its currency funds,
which bear no initial charge in any case.
However, if the Schwab service expanded to include a large number of funds,
it might represent an attractive alternative to onshore funds for
cost-conscious investors.
The tax advantages of investing offshore have traditionally applied more to
bond and deposit funds. Offshore bond funds, unlike their onshore
counterparts, can pay income gross. This can make them attractive to
non-taxpayers, who otherwise would have to wait to reclaim the tax on an
onshore fund from the Inland Revenue. However, taxpayers should note that
they are obliged to declare the income received from an offshore fund to the
Revenue.
Deposit funds offer the chance to 'roll-up' interest gross. While this does
not avoid tax, this system has two tax advantages. The first is simple:
money compounded gross grows faster than money compounded net. The second
advantage is that the investor does not have to pay the tax bill until the
money is withdrawn; if, for example, he or she is about to retire and move
into a lower tax bracket, this may have advantages. However, there is one
important caveat: with taxes rising, there is a chance investors may end up
paying an even higher tax bill.
The Budget will have reinforced the offshore advantages of these funds.
According to Autif: 'Dividends received from cash or bond funds situated in
Luxembourg or Dublin will be taxed at only 20 per cent in the hands of UK
basic-rate investors, who will (therefore) be encouraged to invest in
interest-invested offshore funds.'
A more simple advantage of investing offshore is that building societies
sometimes offer higher rates to offshore customers, because their costs are
lower overseas.
What about safety? One name that instantly springs to mind when the word
offshore is mentioned is Barlow Clowes. The memories of such scandals may
prevent some from investing overseas. However, the cautious offshore
investor should be able to sleep at night. There are a number of
well-respected names operating offshore, such as GT and Fidelity, and many
funds are also SIB-recognised, which means that the UK's chief financial
services regulator has accepted that regulation in the offshore centre is
equivalent to that in the UK, and that the funds are run in a proper manner.
Despite the relatively slow progress it has made, the offshore market will
continue to expand. The greatest beneficiaries of offshore investment are
expatriates, who find it advantageous to keep their investment out of the
tax net of both their home and adopted countries. As multinational
corporations increasingly switch their executives from country to country,
and as more people decide to retire to sunnier climes such as France and
Spain, the demand from expatriates seems bound to increase.

FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): You can run,
but you can't hide from reality - Keynote / The forces that have cut
building society interest have also reduced prospective unit trust income
</HEADLINE>

It was an oh-so-familiar story in the final quarter of last year, as another
interest-rate cut brought gloom to building society savers but the stock
market took another leap forward after Kenneth Clarke's first Budget. The
good news, however, received a lot more publicity than the bad.
Once again, playing safe was the wrong thing to do. The best returns were
enjoyed by those investors who put money into some of the more volatile far
eastern stock markets, especially Hong Kong where the index showed a
remarkable gain of 59 per cent for the quarter and over 100 per cent for the
calendar year.
A year and more after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism, the British economy started to look really rather good. Inflation
failed to accelerate as the pessimists had forecast, and economic growth
picked up to around 2 per cent. Unemployment continued its slow decline.
The markets were in the right mood to celebrate Kenneth Clarke's Budget.
True, some daunting tax increases were written in for the next two or three
years, but the mood in the markets was bullish, and people were ready to
assume that the economy would be buoyant enough to accommodate the tax
burden. At the same time, the fiscal tightening meant that the menace of the
towering Budget deficits was being tackled.
Suddenly there was a realisation that there might be too little paper being
offered to the stock and bond markets over the next few years, rather than
too much. Over the Christmas period there was a whiff of buying panic as
share prices raced ahead and gilt-edged yields sank below 6 1/2 per cent,
the lowest long-term interest rates for 26 years.
The old inflationary problems that have dogged the British economy for so
many years seem at last to be fading. Few now think that the official 4 per
cent inflation ceiling will be tested next year, even though VAT on fuel
will affect the retail price index.
Pay inflation has slipped to a remarkably low 3 per cent. The downside of
that is that consumer spending will be constrained by the slimness of pay
packets: most economists now reckon that a fall in saving will be required
to keep the economy growing strongly. But low pay inflation, at a time when
productivity appears to be rising quite fast, implies that price inflation
will remain subdued for a considerable time ahead.
That is the main reason why the yield on long gilts fell by a whole
percentage point in the October-December quarter, from 7.46 to 6.43 per
cent.
Underpinning the whole bull market, however, has been the decline in
inflation-proofed real yields, which are calculated on index-linked gilts.
These dropped from 3.9 to 2.9 per cent over 1993 as a whole, with a third of
the decline concentrated in the final three months.
Not only did this help fixed-interest gilts, but it was also fundamental to
the strength of equities at a time when dividends have been scarcely growing
at all. The argument is that both shares and index-linked gilts offer
inflation-proofed yields, with the difference being that, whereas share
dividends provide growth, the index gilt income is safer.
Usually investors are willing to accept a slightly lower income on
index-linked gilts than on the average share, except very occasionally when
dividend growth prospects are unusually good (which at present they are
not). It follows that the average dividend yield could not have fallen by
anything like the amount it did last year - from 4.35 to 3.37 per cent -
unless underlying real yields had given a lead.
So, as well as the good news about share prices, savers have to cope with
the bad news about the income on their investments. This has already made
last year a pretty rotten one for the building societies, with savers
starting to withdraw their money and turn elsewhere. Unit trusts pulled in
over Pounds 8bn in new investment during 1993 against only Pounds 0.6bn the
year before, and the life insurance industry also saw money pouring into its
lump sum products.
But although you can run, you can't hide from reality: the prospective
income on these alternative investments has also fallen sharply.
People approaching retirement with personal pension plans face this problem
in a very direct way. For them the good news is that their personal fund has
probably appreciated by 20 per cent or so in the past year; but the bad news
is that the annuity which the Inland Revenue requires them to buy at
retirement has fallen by perhaps 15 per cent (and even more, for retirement
at 60 rather than at 65).
Of course, when inflation is low, a small income will go further, because it
is not being eroded so fast by cost-of-living increases. The quantity may be
smaller but the quality is better. However, when you are working out your
household budgets for the first year or two of retirement you may get a bit
of a shock.
The mighty occupational pension schemes face the same kind of problem. On
paper they had a terrific 1993, with the typical fund enjoying a total
investment return of about 28 per cent. But their actuarial valuations will
not be very flattering, because the sharp fall in long-term interest rates
has meant that the present cost of providing for future pensions has jumped
by about 25 per cent.
If you want to cash in your investment gains and spend the proceeds on goods
and services today, then you are genuinely better off (the same argument
applies to buying houses). But the appreciation in your portfolio will not
buy you more security in the future.
Moreover, although established investors are cushioned, if you are a new
saver - whether an individual, or a young company starting a pension scheme
for the first time - you are actually worse off than in recent years. This
is because the fall in prospective real investment returns means that you
will have to save harder in order to achieve the same long-term benefit.
If you invest Pounds 1,000 at 4 per cent compound it will grow to Pounds
2,666 after 25 years. At 3 per cent the final result will be only Pounds
2,094. Putting it another way, at the lower real interest rate you will have
to save 27 per cent more in order to achieve the same result over such a
period.
So if the stock and bond markets were to retreat a little in 1994, not
everybody should be miserable about it.

FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: RMC hit hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upsurge in RMC shares was abruptly reversed by a profits downgrade from
James Capel, the market's leading agency broker. Capel was said to have
eased its 1993 profits number to Pounds 172m, that for 1994 to Pounds 195m
and the 1995 figure to Pounds 225m, because of worries about the German
economy.
RMC shares, among the building sector's best performers since the turn of
the year, fell 33 to 993p after the Capel downgrade, although market
turnover failed to reach the 1m mark. Redland, also heavily influenced by
the German economy, lost 15 at 616p.
The market registered satisfaction with the decision by Ofgas to implement a
new gas pricing formula, which is shifted from inflation minus 5 per cent to
inflation minus 4 per cent, hoisting British Gas to a day's high of 351p. It
closed 4 1/2 ahead at 349 1/2 p, with turnover expanding to 16m.
'This is the first good news for British Gas for some time and should see
the shares move ahead in the short term,' said one analyst.
Enterprise Oil eased 3 to 458p, with dealers slightly surprised at the
market's lack of response to the recent Elf presentation in London at which
Elf directors said they regarded the Enterprise shareholding as a 'strategic
stake'.
An upbeat presentation to analysts by leisure group Granada helped the
shares and also boosted television group LWT (up 18 at 706p), for which
Granada has launched an all-paper bid. The presentation led to a rise in
Granada shares of 16 to 585p and ensured that the LWT bid was valued at 702p
a share. Analysts said that the rise relieved pressure on Granada to raise
its offer following the relatively high price put on rival Anglia TV by
investment group MAI. Anglia gained 3 at 658p and MAI rose 2 to 301p.
After the market closed LWT hit back at Granada's move to extend its offer
for the television group, saying: 'Granada's latest message to shareholders
smacks of desperation.'
Pearson, which has a stake in satellite group BSkyB, rose 4 to 668p on news
that BSkyB is looking at ways of repaying some of the money invested by
shareholders. News International, which owns a majority interest in BSkyB,
added 12 at 289p.
Healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman put on 6 at 680p as UBS took the stock off
its sell list arguing that the shares had underperformed the broad market
and the company's brand investment was poised to improve. The house also
says that as a company which earns 80 per cent of its cash overseas it would
benefit from a stronger dollar - UBS has a currency forecast of Dollars 1.30
to the pound for 1995.
A mixed trading statement from Tate &amp; Lyle confirmed the opinion of some in
the market that the stock looked overbought and the shares slid 14 to 439p.
There was a big switch by one institution out of Bass, down 11 at 568p, and
into Whitbread 'A', steady at 603p.
Westland Group raced up 14 to 289p following a positive outlook on its
prospects at a Panmure Gordon defence conference. British Aerospace
benefited from similar sentiment at the same meeting and firmed 2 to 438p.
Shares in British Airways fell 7 to 464p in trade of 4.8m after James Capel
urged investors to switch out of the stock and into BAA, which it said was
undervalued. The UK airports operator moved 8 ahead to 1032p on the advice,
with volume reaching 1.3m.
NFC eased 2 to 282p on hints that one of the large Scottish institutions had
a big line of stock on offer.

Some further determined and sizeable selling pressure, said to have emanated
from the US, was thought to have been behind the heavy turnover and
underperformance of British Petroleum shares.
They eventually settled a net 4 off at 365p, roughly in line with a poorly
performing oil sector. However, it was the weight of the selling pressure
which caught dealers' attention, with a block of 7.7m shares sold into the
market early on, followed by a series of smaller blocks via the inter dealer
broker system.
Oil specialists said the big US energy funds had continued to lighten their
holdings in BP, one of the FT-SE 100's best performers over the past 18
months, ahead of the company's fourth-quarter and full-year figures
scheduled for February 2. They also pointed out that UK institutions were
happy to increase weightings in BP.
Shell Transport continued to attract widespread selling, closing 6 off at
718p. 'They feel awful,' noted one specialist. What discouraged oil analysts
was the sector's performance against a marginally firmer oil price, which
was trading around the Dollars 14.35 a barrel mark towards the close,
boosted primarily by the continuing cold weather in the US.

FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers under pressure

The last batch of Christmas trading reports from high street retailers came
amid growing signs of investor disquiet at the patchiness of the recovery in
consumer confidence.
Shares in Marks and Spencer, the jewel in the portfolio of many an
investment manager, were marked down after the sparse details unveiled in
its trading statement. Speculation of improved trading at Marks in recent
weeks had led some analysts to upgrade profits forecasts. The shares closed
15 1/2 down at 426 1/2 p in turnover of 14m.
But there was worse to come as Marks' early morning announcement was
followed by the trading statement from Burton, described by one specialist
as 'the worst of all possible scenarios'.
Burton's margins were badly hit and sales were flat, which contrasted
starkly with Next's sparkling figures only two days ago. Burton shares
retreated 8 3/4 to 58 3/4 p in very heavy turnover of 44m. Brokers made
swingeing cuts to their forecasts, with Cazenove and BZW, the company's
joint brokers, said to have lowered their 1994 profits predictions by 33 per
cent from Pounds 60m to Pounds 40m. But Next was not immune to the bearish
tone and slid 9 1/2 to 231 1/2 p.
Furniture retailer MFI produced results at the top end of expectations.
Sales were encouraging and gross margins firm. Analysts upgraded forecasts
by around 20 per cent to a range of Pounds 68m to Pounds 73m. Ms Emma
Burdett at Hoare Govett reiterated her positive recommendation.
'MFI is a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy sector,' she commented. The
shares moved forward 5 to 179p.

FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lacklustre day in the derivatives saw the March futures contract breach
its recent support level as Wednesday's disappointing gilts auction
continued to cast a shadow over the market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The sombre mood that followed the gilts auction failed to deter the early
bargain hunters for the March contract on the FT-SE 100. Moving gently
forward, it reached the day's high of 3,456 at mid-morning.
As the buying orders were completed, dealers turned their attention to the
continuing weakness in the bond markets. The sellers soon had the upper hand
and March went into retreat, falling through its recent 3,450 support level
and pulling the underlying cash market lower.
The tentative opening on Wall Street only served to increase the selling and
the contract finished at the low of the day of 3,427, more or less in line
with the cash market but at a discount to its fair value premium to cash of
around 7 points. Volume, at 8,725 lots, was dull.
Turnover in the traded options declined to 42,788 contracts from Wednesday's
50,704, with 14,087 transacted in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,005 in the Euro
FT-SE option.
British Steel once again led the league table of active stock options (at
3,523), with most of the day's trading done in the April calls and puts. It
was followed by National Westminster Bank, at 2,280 contracts, and
Storehouse, at 2,170. A big seller of calls was responsible for the majority
of the turnover in Argyll Group and it finished with a total of 1,814 lots
dealt.

FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices continue to fall in
higher volume - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing trading statements from the retail sector, together with
further weakness in government bonds, undermined the UK stock market
yesterday. Early firmness, which held until mid-afternoon, owed much to the
futures-related demand, and once this was completed share prices renewed
their downward drift.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 8.8 easier at 3,427.3, having rallied from the
3,425 area. Those market strategists who have been predicting a correction
in the market believe that the Footsie could fall to around 3,400 without
necessarily implying a significant change of direction.
The setback was, as so often happens, triggered from the stock index futures
sector, where the March Footsie contract closed near to parity with the cash
index. But wider factors were at work, including reports that a noted US
market specialist had turned bearish in futures and that some UK houses had
tried to unload bonds left over from this Wednesday's auc-tion of Pounds
2.75bn of British government securities.
Nervousness over bond markets in London and elsewhere counter-balanced
suggestions in some quarters that yesterday's slightly discouraging reports
from leading UK retailers would serve to strengthen the chances that base
rates would be cut sooner than expected.
Shares in Marks and Spencer, the monarch of Britain's high street retailers
and one of the most widely held shares in the market, fell sharply after the
market took a cautious view of the board's statement that Christmas sales
had been in line with expectations. Investors also reacted badly to comments
at the annual meeting of Burton, another leading clothing retailer.
Much of the market's powerful advance in December and early January hinged
on confidence that the Christmas retail trade would confirm the recovery in
the domestic economy. Retail shares gave ground widely yesterday in
significantly increased trading volume.
Dealers commented that trading volume has increased as the market has given
ground. Seaq volume of 972.6m shares yesterday saw non-Footsie business
remain high at around 63 per cent of the total. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index,
supported initially by the aftermath of traded options expiries, slipped
away later to close 3.3 down at 4,076.4.
Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained strong, although
below last week's totals. On Wednesday, retail business in UK equities was
worth Pounds 1.86bn, suggesting that the institutions were again active in
the market.
London yesterday failed to follow the brighter tone of the other continental
European stock markets. However, the rally in Hong Kong was reflected
quickly in HSBC.
In spite of the doubts over short-term prospects, UK equity strategists
remained favourable towards the London market for the medium term. Smith New
Court, the UK integrated securities house, sees London as offering
'considerable security' in global markets threatened by short term risks,
with the strength of sterling perhaps prompting an interest rate cut that
could prove unwarranted.
Flemings Research believes the FT-SE 100 Index could reach 3,700 by April,
with base rate hopes kept alive by 'well founded fears' that tax increases
in the spring may prompt deceleration of econ-omic activity. However, it
remains cautious on the outlook for UK consumers.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at historic high ahead of
growth data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks climbed into uncharted territory yesterday after the bond market
showed resilience ahead of today's initial estimate of fourth-quarter
economic growth, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.30 up at 3,926.30, breaking the
previous record of 3,914.48 set on Friday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained
3.85 at 477.05, also a new peak. The Nasdaq composite put on 4.08 at 792.88.
NYSE volume was 346.5m shares.
In spite of a fresh round of news on corporate earnings, stocks were in a
holding pattern until the afternoon, when program trading helped to extend
modest gains registered early in the day.
Activity was flavoured by anticipation of the government's preliminary
reading on gross domestic product in the final three months of last year.
Bond prices showed resilience in the face of unfavourable developments.
Traders shrugged off a 2.2 per cent gain in December factory orders of
durable goods as old news, and dismissed a big drop in unemployment benefit
claims as a weather-related aberration.
As a result, the inflation-sensitive long bond rose for a second consecutive
day, a trend that was mirrored in the stock market. Utilities, especially
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, enjoyed their biggest day's rise in
three years.
Corporate earnings were not entirely ignored, however. The bellwether Dow
average was initially suppressed largely because of disappointment over 3M's
performance. The cyclical stock, a high-flier in recent weeks, fell Dollars
4 1/8 to Dollars 106 7/8 on posting flat earnings and casting doubts over
its prospects this year.
Offsetting the effect of 3M's decline, Caterpillar rose Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 101 1/2 , General Electric Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 and
General Motors Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 7/8 . The other car makers were
strong as well, with the Big Three reported to be scheduling an 80 per cent
increase in production this week to make up for recent weather-related
shutdowns. Ford put on Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 66 3/4 and Chrysler Dollars
1 1/8 at Dollars 60 1/2 .
Near the top of the NYSE's most active list, Sara Lee shed Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 23 3/8 after warning that its net income in the current quarter may
fall short of analysts' forecasts.
In telecommunications, AT&amp;T was in play after good news on its revenue
growth and operating earnings in the final 1993 period. The stock firmed
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 .
Canada
Falling gold shares offset an otherwise mainly strong Toronto market
yesterday. The TSE 300 index closed just 7.1 ahead at 4,467.3 and advances
led declines by 451 to 365. Volume reached a heavy 87.2m shares valued at
CDollars 963.9m.
Eleven of the 14 stock groups rose, but the golds index dropped 3.9 per cent
as the spot bullion price tumbled USDollars 6.90 an ounce in New York. Banks
gained 1.8 per cent, real estate 1.7 per cent and consumer products 1.3 per
cent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Athens pauses after scaling new peaks -
But opinion remains divided as to the market's next move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two months of frenzied activity, triggered by the flotation of six
leading Greek construction companies, investors on the Athens stock exchange
are pausing for breath.
The Athens general index relinquished 0.4 per cent yesterday to close at
1,109, its fourth decline in five days.
The index peaked at 1,194 on January 18, its best level for more than two
years, although still well short of the bourse's all-time high of 1,684 set
in July 1990.
Brokers and market analysts attributed the fall to profit-taking by foreign
investors, who drove the market up by some 20 per cent earlier this month,
reflecting the current enthusiasm for emerging markets among US and
international fund managers.
The brokers estimate that institutional investors abroad accounted for at
least 50 per cent of daily turnover, which has averaged more than Dr15bn
(Dollars 60m) since the start of the year. The increased pace of trading is
all the more remarkable given that average daily turnover in 1993 amounted
to just Dr2.5bn.
Yet opinions are divided about the market's next move. With the average p/e
ratio at 20, Greek equities now look expensive, while overall economic
prospects are gloomy.
Greece shows few signs of emerging from recession, with growth for 1994
projected at only 1.2 per cent and the public sector deficit likely to
worsen from last year's 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Phaedon Tamvakakis, managing director of Hambros Hellenic Growth Fund,
said: 'It is really quite hard to justify a continuing rise for the moment.
The fundamentals are not encouraging and Greek equities no longer seem
cheap.' However, Mr Yannia Tegopoulos, chief analyst at Midland Pantelakis
Securities, sounded more sanguine. 'The rise has been based on liquidity
rather than p/e ratios so far, and there is still lots of money around to be
allocated.'
With more than 30 Greek companies in a lengthening queue for listings on the
bourse, there will be plenty of shares available over the next few months.
The success of the construction sector listings, all heavily subscribed, has
brought new entrants flocking to the market.
The construction companies, all family-owned, were seeking funds to finance
new equipment purchases and provide working capital as they prepare to bid
for more than Dr6,000bn worth of infrastructure projects being co-financed
by the European Union.
Their example is being followed by other growth-oriented companies anxious
to avoid high interest rates, still averaging above 20 per cent for working
capital.
Ms Katerina Ferentinos of BZW Hellas said: 'The market is now set to broaden
considerably, with the arrival of companies from sectors that traditionally
have shunned the stock market in favour of raising financing privately.'
One such applicant is Teletypos, which controls Mega Channel, Greece's most
successful private television station. Owned by a consortium of Greek
newspaper publishers, the company intends to raise Dr10bn, including an
international tranche of about Dr2.5bn.
Two passenger ferry lines, Strintzis and Dane, keen to start rennovating
their fleets ahead of the EU's deregulation of coastal shipping at the end
of the 1990s, will be the first shipping concerns to join the bourse. At the
same time, a number of blue chip companies are planning rights issues.
Michaniki, until November the only big construction company on the bourse,
has announced a Dr9.2bn rights issue. Credit Bank, the largest private bank,
plans a capital increase of close to Dr30bn.
The flow of new issues is likely to continue for much of 1994. Although the
socialist government which came to power last October has radically
curtailed Greece's privatisation programme, it still plans to float 15 to 20
per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications company, on the bourse this
year.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan leads move into record
territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourse performances were peppered with record highs yesterday, but downbeat
views on German equities from four London sources - James Capel, Kleinwort
Benson, Morgan Stanley and (in reiteration) Goldman Sachs - brought a sour
note into the proceedings, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN moved into record territory as a buying spree by foreign and domestic
investors spurred turnover to an all-time high of L1,030bn. The Comit index
rose 8.63 to 636.20.
While domestic investors were still sensitive to political developments in
the run up to general elections on March 27, foreign buyers from Europe,
Japan and the US were less inhibited.
Montedison rose another L71 or 7 per cent to L1,089 and the huge volume of
L166m shares reinforced speculation that someone was stake building.
Ferruzzi added L41 to L1,781 in volume of 40.6m shares.
Hoare Govett is forecasting a 25 per cent rise in the BCI index this year,
after last year's 39 per cent advance, given the market's very strong
liquidity, the improving macroeconomic picture, the cont-inuing
privatisation process and the expectation of corp-orate earnings recovery.
However, Merrill Lynch said that the turbulent trading of the last five
months demonstrated how quickly confidence could come and go, adding that
the market's price volatility should always be taken into account. The fact
that Italy was likely to be exploited as a lagging market in Europe also
raised warning flags about whether its recovery would be sustainable.
ZURICH hit a record close for the third consecutive session, although late
profit-taking brought prices back from their best levels. The SMI index
added 3.9 to 3,095.2, having peaked at 3,110.3.
Holderbank rose SFr37 to SFr977 after a recommendation from Credit Suisse.
Oerlikon-Buhrle put on SFr9 or 6.4 per cent to SFr150 after one broker
recommended a switch into the stock from Georg Fischer, SFr10 lower at
SFr1,180.
MADRID hit an early peak on the current theme of political and corporate
renewal, but after an intraday 353.37 the general index subsided to 348.62 -
a mere 0.22 up on the day, but still a closing high.
OSLO's financials and industrials took over from a slightly weaker shipping
sector as the market peaked again, the all-share index closing 6.88 higher
at 673.76.
STOCKHOLM majored on blue chips as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 21.1
to a new high of 1,560.2 in turnover of SKr2.7bn. Ericsson reversed its
slide after Tuesday's downgrade by Goldman Sachs, and the B shares put on
SKr9 to SKr358, while Volvo B advanced SKr16 to SKr653 helped by buy notes.
BRUSSELS saw most of its activity in second line issues but the Bel-20 index
still made a record high, climbing 5.98 to 1,514.60 in turnover of BFr2.7bn.
FRANKFURT came off a day's high of 2,139.32 to close with the Dax only 5.97
higher at 2,125.14. Turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM9.5bn.
Capel's chief strategist, Mr Oliver Kamm, saw a stark contrast between
Germany and other European prospects this year; Mr David Roche of Morgan
Stanley dropped Germany from 9.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent of his global
model portfolio; Kleinwort underweighted the market and Goldman Sachs said
again that it continued to underweight German equities in its global and
European portfolios.
Daimler ended DM20.50 higher at DM809 after higher Mercedes car sales
forecasts for 1994. However, within the context of a change of stance to
overweight on the European automotive sector, Mr Bob Barber of James Capel
recommended a Daimler sale - 'based principally on the outlook for aerospace
as well as the demanding rating'.
PARIS dipped towards the close, disappointed that the Bank of France had
made no move on interest rates. The CAC-40 index, after 2,299.52, closed
1.40 lower at 2,280.95, pressured by a downtrend in futures.
LVMH improved FFr62 to FFr3,952 following an analysts meeting at which the
group said that it expected to make a one-off gain of some FFr4.4bn
following the change in its cross-shareholdings with Guinness announced last
week.
AMSTERDAM gained early ground before slipping back once more by the close,
the AEX ending up 0.09 at 425.71 after a session high of 428.56.
There was considerable interest among stocks selected by a poll of analysts
on Dutch television on Wednesday night: Philips, Akzo, Ahold, Bols Wessanen
and Borsumiji. Among these, Akzo slipped Fl 1.10 to Fl 209.70 after its
shareholders approved plans for the merger with Nobel of Sweden.
ISTANBUL dropped another 7.6 per cent, the composite index's fall of
1,615.04 to 19,513.6 making a five day local curency loss of 33.6 per cent
before Wednesday's near 12 per cent devaluation of the lira.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Politics restrain Tokyo
as region powers ahead

<TEXT>
Equity prices dropped by 1.3 per cent as purchases by foreign investors
failed to offset arbitrage unwinding and institutional profit-taking amid
growing political uncertainty, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average settled 246.42 lower at 18,891.79, after moving
between 19,324.73 and 18,811.78. The Topix index of all first section issues
shed 13.82 to 1,536.50 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 4.25
to 1,266.15.
Brokers said that the recent euphoria surrounding what many speculated as
the inevitable passage of the political reform bills of Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, proved unable to sustain a Nikkei rally for
the third straight session.
The prime minister threatened yesterday to resign, after a meeting with a
joint committee of both houses of parliament, if his political agenda was
not passed by the lower house.
A general consensus among market participants is that investor sentiment is
firm, and that any political headway will fuel a major equity rally.
Without the political reform package, however, plans for the government's
economic stimulus package, or for the deregulation of domestic financial
markets, will receive no attention, according to the government.
This will mean a blow to hopes for an end to a bear market, already in its
fourth year, and will place more pressure on the Bank of Japan to reduce the
official discount rate, which is already at a record low.
Volume was estimated at 430m shares, compared with Wednesday's 398m.
Profit-taking pushed banking shares lower. Industrial Bank of Japan
retreated Y120 to Y3,130, Fuji Bank dropped Y60 to Y2,050 and Sakura Bank
lost Y40 at Y1,470.
The consumer electronic sector weakened as the yen appreciated against the
dollar. Pioneer Electronic slipped Y110 to Y2,810, Sony Y20 to Y5,850 and
TDK Y20 to Y3,950.
In spite of the day's losses, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced
Y19,000 to Y874,000 on the strength of reports that it might enter the
multimedia market by acquiring a stake in a US-based software development
house.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 77.68 down at 20,754.64 in volume of 106m
shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets produced a strong performance, with advances in many of
the markets attributed to a series of domestic news and developments.
TAIWAN saw a strong rebound in the financial sector, while investors were
generally encouraged by suggestions that the Securities and Exchange
Commission might raise the ceiling for foreign investment to Dollars 20bn
from Dollars 5bn.
The index rose 176.89, or 3 per cent, to 6,022.39 as turnover swelled to
TDollars 88.2bn from TDollars 53.9bn. The financial sector improved by 6 per
cent.
Textiles, which have been active this week on expectations of a recovery in
the industry, saw heavy profit-taking, with Shinkong Synthetic Fibres and
Ruentex both down 70 cents at TDollars 26.40 and TDollars 27.80
respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its strong rebound on the back of retail and
institutional buying, with the composite index finishing 44.93, or 4.4 per
cent, up at 1,074.24.
Brokers said a large local institution was seen accumulating shares, while
easing of trading restrictions by stockbroking firms saw a return of retail
investors.
HONG KONG put in a powerful early advance and then maintained the higher
levels for the rest of the day.
The Hang Seng index rose 230.85, or 2.1 per cent, to 11,470.42, regaining
almost all of Wednesday's loss as fears dissipated over the future of
Sino-British relations.
Turnover eased to a provisional HKDollars 7.36bn from Wednesday's HKDollars
8.45bn.
SEOUL finished at a four-year high as investors concentrated on buying blue
chip stocks. The composite index added 13.10 at 907.44.
Sentiment was helped by reports that the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation
Fund would no longer liquidate its holdings.
SINGAPORE regained some lost ground, closing 1.4 per cent firmer in a
technical rebound led by a strong recovery in the Malaysian stock market.
The Straits Times Industrial index ended 30.81 ahead at 2,286.28.
MANILA edged forward in moderate buying that took the composite index 17.24
higher to 3,002.85.
AUSTRALIA was lifted by strong overseas buying and firmer gold prices.
The All Ordinaries index closed 28.8, or 1.3 per cent, up at 2,250.7 and the
gold shares index 68.9, or 2.7 per cent, stronger at 2,625.1. Turnover
totalled ADollars 676.2m.
NEW ZEALAND finished at its highest point since September 1989, but on
comparatively low volume. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 24.31, or 1 per
cent, at 2,308.42.
BANGKOK added 2.7 per cent following better than expected results from Thai
Farmers Bank, up Bt5, or 4 per cent, at Bt123. The SET index advanced 38.95
to 1,498.09.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Yen rises against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen gained ground yesterday against the dollar as political and economic
uncertainty in Japan remained the focus of currency market attention, writes
Philip Gawith.
Although the Japanese currency traded slightly firmer, the market remains
unable to take a clear view on the way ahead. Two parallel sets of events -
US/Japan trade talks, and the troubles of the government - continue to pull
the market in opposite directions.
Meanwhile, the Bank of France's newly formed monetary council yesterday kept
the market in the dark by declining to reveal whether or not it had made a
decision on the lowering of interest rates.
The yen closed in London at Y109.415 to the dollar, up from Wednesday's
Y110.420, bolstered by bearish comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury
secretary. It finished in New York at Y108.60.
Mr Bentsen complained about the low level of import penetration into Japan
and said more action was required to help the economy. 'Market penetration
by foreign products in Japan is too low. Likewise with foreign investment
levels,' Mr Bentsen said in remarks for delivery to the US Chamber of
Commerce.
There is, however, a view in the market that if a fiscal package looks like
being delayed, the Bank of Japan may be forced to step in and offer an
economic stimulus by lowering interest rates. This gained support yesterday
from a report quoting a Bank of Japan official as saying that exchange rates
should reflect fundamentals rather than politics.
IDEA, in its financial markets commentary, said the statement meant that the
'BOJ is ready to step in if yen gains accelerate'. There are also reports
that the dollar enjoys support at Y109.05 from buy orders placed by Japanese
life offices.
Mr Hosokawa, the prime minister, said he would not hang on to power if his
poli-tical reform package were thwarted. Analysts said this increased the
prospect of an early election. The four-bill reform package must pass by
tomorrow, when the parliamentary session ends, or lapse.
One angle to the Japanese story is whether it will check the rise of the
Australian dollar, which closed yesterday in London at USDollars 0.7095, a
rise of nearly 11 per cent from USDollars 0.6410 at the end of October. Mr
Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said the Australian dollar, which
was now looking overbought, should be sensitive to events in Japan, which
takes about 25 per cent of Australian exports.
While the Australian currency has already factored in the weak state of the
Japanese economy, observers believe it would take a knock if the Japanese
government fails to pass a political and economic package.
Analysts expressed surprise that the US dollar did not make further ground
after the release of strong durable goods sales figures. Apart from
weakening against the yen, it dipped to DM1.7441 from Wednesday's DM1.748.
It fell in New York trading to end at DM1.7290. Analysts said investors were
unwilling to take long dollar positions while Japanese policy remained on
hold.
The market is expecting a good number today when US fourth quarter GDP
figures are released. Expectations range from 4 to 7 per cent.
Sterling softened, finishing in London at DM2.6031 after Wednesday's
DM2.6089, and at Dollars 1.4925, off from Dollars 1.4926. Dealers said the
strong economic signals of recent weeks had tailed off in the last few days.
A further technical factor keeping the pound down was its repeated failure
to break through the Dollars 1.50 level.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, yesterday announced
the bank's monetary targets for 1994, but kept silent on the question of
interest rate cuts. He said the central bank's policy council had decided to
target average annual M3 growth at around 5 per cent over roughly four
years. French M3 rose by only 1.4 per cent last year, excluding exceptional
items, in spite of a target range of 4.0 to 6.5 per cent.
Mr Trichet declined to make any predictions on official rates, saying: 'It
is the privilege of central bankers never to say anything in advance.' He
said the Bank of France's monetary policy objective in 1994 was to maintain
price stability. Mr Turner of BZW said he did not think there was any large
currency message in the bank's announcement other than the bank 'making
clear that it had no intention of delinking policy from the Bundesbank'.
Many Turkish banks refrained yesterday from dollar trading with the market
thrown into disarray by the government's 11.97 per cent devaluation of the
Turkish lira. Bankers said the central bank wanted to show it had a firm
grip on currency markets with early action, after 10 days of turmoil which
sent the lira plunging against the dollar. The bank intervened in the
market, selling the dollar and pushing it down to TL16,000 from TL18,000,
but it rose again to end at TL16,000-16,500.
The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money market with about Pounds
950m of late assistance. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 481m of
assistance. The revised liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.55bn, up from an
initial Pounds 1.4bn forecast.
German call money rose after the Bundesbank withdrew DM7bn via its weekly
tender for securities repurchase funds. Banks quoted call money at between
6.50 and 6.65 per cent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco's Dollars 100m futures
fiasco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A simple mistake may have triggered a desperate spiral of futures trading on
the London Metal Exchange which, when fully unwound, is likely to result in
losses of around Dollars 100m for Codelco, Chile's state copper company.
The explanation beginning to emerge yesterday was that Mr Juan Pablo Davila,
Codelco's chief futures market operator, incorrectly input transactions into
his computer last September, confusing sales for buys and vice versa.
According to Mr Davila's account, he then traded against these erroneous
positions, compounding losses.
Mr Davila is said to have realised his mistake only a month later by which
time losses had mounted to millions of dollars.
Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco president, said that instead of informing his
superiors, as required for any loss of over Dollars 1m, Mr Davila 'saw
himself in the middle of a cyclone and made bigger and bigger operations in
order to retrieve the situation.'
This 'resulted in a multiplication of the original errors.'
It is unclear how Mr Davila, who could now face prosecution, was able to
keep matters secret for so long, avoiding safety controls that should have
included regular reporting of transactions.
This month, Mr Davila is believed to have attempted to salvage the situation
when he concluded further deals by telephone during his holidays.
When those deals backfired, Mr Davila broke down and last Friday confessed
the whole story to his immediate boss, Mr Owen Guerrini, head of sales.
Mr Patrick Cussen, managing director of Brandeis Chile, which represents the
LME trader in Santiago, said Mr Davila's account was plausible. 'I think
it's terrible, but credible,' he said.
Mr Cussen, a former Codelco employee, said that Mr Davila would mainly have
been dealing in paper transactions, with little commitment to physical
delivery of copper.
He discounted speculation that Codelco would now have to unload a lot of
stock.
'As far as I understand, that's not true. These were paper transactions and
there will be no physical delivery,' Mr Cussen said.
Codelco began to use the futures market in the early 1980s for hedging
purposes.
As long ago as 1989, the company made 29 futures transactions which resulted
in losses of Dollars 20m, according to Mr Alejandro Hales, mining minister.
Mr Cussen said that he did not believe Codelco's international reputation
would be damaged.
Reuter reports from Santiago: Chile's President Patricio Aylwin last night
asked the Supreme Court to appoint a judge to investigate the
irregularities.
'There is damage and this damage impairs the country as a whole,' Mr Aylwin
said after he requested the appointment.

Mr Gilson Ximenes, head of Brazil's National Coffee Department (DNC), handed
in his resignation yesterday to the Minister of Industry and Commerce Mr
Elcio Alvares, Reuter reports from Rio de Janeiro.
A DNC spokesman said Mr Ximenes stepped down for 'personal reasons' after
nine months in the job. A replacement had not yet been named. His
resignation has been linked to that of his former boss, Mr Jose Eduardo
Andrade Vieira, who resigned as industry and commerce minister last year to
pursue political interests.
Reuter also reported from San Jose that Costa Rica yesterday suspended
exports of inferior quality coffee, following the example of Colombia and
Central American producers last week. Mr Guillermo Canet, executive director
of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute (ICAFE), said the aim was to support
coffee prices in international markets. The decision, taken by the ICAFE
governing board, affected coffee varieties whose prices had fallen below
Dollars 80 per 46kg sack.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Somincor forecasts first fall
from profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Somincor of Portugal, which mines Europe's biggest copper deposit, expects
to register a loss of about Es200m (Dollars 1.1m) in 1993, its first loss
since begining operations in 1989 with a profit of Es10bn.
It said, however, that even if copper and tin prices remained at present
levels, a stringent cost-reduction programme should move it back into a net
Es1.5bn profit in 1994. This compares with a profit of Es8.9bn in 1992.
The company, 51 per cent owned by the state with the rest in the hands of
RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said that 1993
production of 1.7m tonnes of copper and tin ore and sales of 610,000 tonnes
of concentrate (an intermediate material) were slightly higher than in 1992.
But sales had fallen 10 per cent from their 1992 level of Es33.2bn.
Its mine in southern Portugal, one of the most advanced in the world,
reached its target of extracting an annual 1.6m tonnes of ore one year after
start-up in 1990. Production is 90 per cent copper ore and 10 per cent tin
ore.
Final results for 1993 have not yet been published but a spokesman said the
expected loss was mainly caused by a 17 per cent fall in copper prices and
an 18 per cent drop in tin prices last year from the 1992 level.
Depreciation of the Portuguese escudo against the dollar in the second half
of 1993 also contributed to the loss. Exchange rate losses for 1993 are
forecast at Es4.3bn. All the mine's production is exported and sold for
dollars.
Last year Somincor (Sociedade Mineira de Neves Corvo) paid back the first
Es7.2bn tranche of an Es28bn loan made by the European Investment Bank in
1988. The company has also contracted Es5bn in short-term loans from the
domestic market. Financial costs are estimated at Es3bn a year. Following
the end of a tax holiday, Somincor will pay corporate tax at 40 per cent for
the first time in 1994.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wool market price rise gathered pace this week. Finer Merinos in
Australia and South Africa were again in the lead, but all the other wools
were tending dearer. At least as important in the processing sectors was an
improvement in demand, presumably as buyers came to the conclusion that
prices were likely to move higher. Resistance to the rise remains strong,
and prices for tops and yarn do not reflect replacement costs, but at least
movement is in the right direction. In the British wool sector prices for
merchanted wool and tops were dearer as a result of further buying from
manufacturing sectors in the domestic market, in anticipation of enhanced
competition for wool at next week's British wool auction. The official
market indicator closed at 522 cents a kg, in Australia yesterday, a new
peak for the season.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan tackles its forestry
crisis - The planting and protection initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quiet of the night is broken by the birds and voices of forest guards
about to begin their chores of the day. The grind of cars, trucks and buses
bring in the first traces of modern day influence to the forest.
This is Changa Manga forest. It is unique because it is one of the remaining
hopes in Pakistan's battle against deforestation, which is beginning to show
its effects on the country's economy and the environment. The forest has
recently played host to the first initiative in Pakistan to protect this
resource in a government-sponsored seminar to encourage farmers to grow more
trees.
'There is some sort of a forestry crisis in this country. We are short of
forestry resources,' says Mr Rafiq Ahmed, deputy inspector-general of
forestry in the federal government. The challenge of developing forests in
Pakistan has grown in importance since a tightening of budgetary resources,
which have in turn intensified pressure to cut down imports. Pakistan
imports wood and wood products worth Rs3.5bn (Dollars 116m) annually.
The government claims that up to 5 per cent of the country's territory is
occupied by forests. But according to independent economists and forestry
experts the actual figure is significantly less due to large scale
deforestation.
The disappearance of the country's trees inevitably brings environmental
problems. Mr Khalid Siddiqui, director general of the Pakistan Forestry
Institute in Peshawar said: 'The prime example (of effects of deforestation)
was the floods in 1992 when there was high rainfall in the North, and in the
absence of tree cover on the hills, all the water came rushing down and it
caused havoc in the plains.'
The government's initiative is to provide sapplings at subsidised rates to
farmers, to encourage 'agro-forestry'. The target is to double the land
under forests within the next 15 years.
It is not yet clear, however, how successful the campaign will be. 'People
are not aware of agro-forestry. They think that if they grow trees, because
of the shade they may not be able to have their regular crops,' said Mrs
Nasrin Ayub, a farm owner who has just begun planting sapplings on her farm.
Many other farmers have complained that lack of proper marketing would leave
little profit once planting expenditure and tree protection over several
years is taken into account.
Mr Maqbool Khichi, president of the National Farmers Council said: 'If the
marketing is done properly, the government will not need to import any wood,
because proper incentives will attract farmers.'
Most of the forest areas are located in the mountainous belt of Northern
Pakistan where just under 10 per cent of the country's population lives. The
long cold winters have prompted the local people to cut the trees. In
addition, a group of powerful traders known as the 'timber mafia' are
allegedly responsible for illegal chopping of trees from forest land.
'There is a need for forests and there is a greed for forests,' said Mr
Siddiqui. He added that while the people in many areas chop trees out of
necessity, for others, it is an important business.
He argued for development of alternative sources of energy and employment as
a step to changing the trends.
Others call for a strong clampdown on illegal timber traders.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium peaks - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM's price touched a 6 1/2 -month peak on the LME as speculators
gambled that the plan for global producer cuts would succeed. Late
profit-taking pegged the rise and three-month aluminium closed at Dollars
1,246.25 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50. Aluminium prices have gained 12 per cent
this month and are 21 per cent above 1993's eight-year lows. Traders
suggested the COPPER market would not be troubled by Codelco's trading
losses and prices tested Dollars 1,890 a tonne again before three-months
metal closed at Dollars 1,883.50, up Dollars 11. GOLD drifted lower amid
rumours that Venezuela's financially troubled Banco Latino might have 10 to
15 tonnes to dump.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: VAT rules threaten trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European commodity trade is being threatened by uncertainty over new rules
on value added tax, according to the Simkins Partnership, a legal group
respresenting traders.
The European Commission is being urged by UK Customs and commodity exchanges
and traders to simplify complex VAT rules and clarify their application to
transactions in oil, metals, grains and soft commodities such as cocoa.
Ms Ann Humphrey, a VAT consultant to Simkins said: 'It is essential that the
confusion and uncertainty in this market caused by the new rules is removed
quickly and in a way which results in the minimum disruption to trade.'
The confusion has arisen over rules introduced at the beginning of last
year. Under the single market regulations, any sale of goods between
registered traders in different member countries does not involve payment of
VAT as long as those goods leave one European Union country and are
delivered to another.
Commodity transactions, however, can involve the sale and re-sale of the
same commodity numerous times, from several different EU countries, without
physical delivery. This means the sale is theoretically liable to different
or multiple VAT levies.
Member countries are also implementing the rules in different ways,
increasing the confusion for traders.
The problem tends to be more pressing in the UK than in the rest of the EU
as London is an important centre for the commodity trade. UK Customs has
been calling on the Commission to take action for the past year and
submitted its proposals to officials last July.
Ms Humphrey said, however, that the Commission had not regarded the issue as
a priority. The Confederation of British Industry has now taken up the issue
with the Commission. The Commission expects to present its proposals in the
next couple of weeks.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US floods hit cereals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent US floods have forced another cut in the forecast for the 1993
world cereal harvest.
The International Wheat Council yesterday shaved another 2m tonnes off its
estimate of coarse grain production, reducing it to 791m tonnes, despite
higher expected outturns in countries other than the US.
The forecast for wheat is unchanged at 562m, though the figure comprises
several revisions. The most important is an increase of 1.6m tonnes to 17.8m
tonnes for Australia, offset by reductions in Argentina, Canada and the US.
The IWC's total cereals forecast for 1993 now stands at 1.353bn tonnes, down
from 1.355bn tonnes.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Poor auction result lowers prices of
long-dated gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds fell almost one point at the long end yesterday in the
wake of Wednesday's poorly-received Pounds 2.75bn auction. There were also
reports that some marketmakers still had quite a lot of the new stock on
their books.
There were some concerns in the market that the forthcoming tax increases
would lead to a temporary rise in inflation though analysts believed that
the underlying rate would stay within the government's 4 per cent ceiling.
The long gilt future on Liffe traded at 118 7/32 in the late afternoon, down
 27/32 on the day and off an intraday high of 119 9/32 .
Some dealers said that the market was likely to recover once the overhang
from the auction had disappeared.
German government bond futures fell back below par in moderate trading as
the market awaited the publication of the M3 data for December early next
week. The bund future on Liffe fell from an intraday high of 100.31 to 99.94
in the late afternoon, down 0.44 point from Wednesday's close. Cash bonds
were also lower, with the benchmark 6.0 per cent 10-year bund dropping to
101.60 from 101.89 late on Wednesday.
French government bonds eased after the Bank of France left its intervention
rate unchanged at 6.20 per cent at its securities repurchase tender
yesterday. A small decline in call money earlier in the weak had raised some
dealers's hopes of a modest cut.
The Bank's targets for average annual M3 growth, of around 5 per cent over
about four years, were in line with expectations and failed to stimulate the
bond market.
Analysts said the market was in a defensive mood in the wake of this week's
issue of FFr22bn worth of state-guaranteed debt. In addition, next week's
OAT auction was expected to raise a similar amount.
There were also signs that international investors were seeking to switch
out of French government bonds into the D-Mark bloc. The notional 10-year
bond future on the Matif traded at 130.20 in the late afternoon, down 0.22
point on the day.
Italian government bonds tumbled in the afternoon on a combination of
profit-taking and growing uncertainty ahead of the forthcoming general
election.
Dealers noted that an opinion poll published yesterday suggested that voter
support had shifted away from the left towards the right-wing and centre
parties.
The March future on Liffe fell from the day's high of 11.72 to trade around
118.12 in the late afternoon, down 0.44 point on the day.
Japanese government bond and futures prices rose in Tokyo trading as their
recent weakness encouraged some bargain-hunting. The March futures rose as
high as 114.31 before closing at 114.25, up 0.65 on the day. In London, the
future rose as high as 114.53.
However, Mr David Knee at Daiwa Europe noted that political and economic
uncertainty still hung over the market. Investors generally remained
cautious ahead of any announcement on the third supplementary budget for
fiscal 1993.
In addition, it was still unclear if there would be an agreement on
political reform, leaving a snap general election as a real possibility.
News of steady growth in factory orders failed to rattle the US Treasury
bond market yesterday, as traders held their positions ahead of today's
estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 5/16 higher at 99
13/16 , with the yield receding to 6.252 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note edged 1/16 forward to 99 25/32, top yield 4.099 per cent.
In early trading, prices showed little movement, despite the Commerce
Department's announcement of a solid 2.2 per cent increase in December
factory orders of durable goods.
Reaction was also muted to news of a big drop in weekly claims for
unemployment benefit, which was attributed to the recent snap of cold
weather.
With the market sitting tight, the long end of the maturity range was able
to post moderate gains in light afternoon activity.
Interest in today's GDP estimate stemmed less from concern about the rate of
growth in the final quarter than from eagerness to establish a gauge of the
economy's current pace. Analysts expect an estimate exceeding 5 per cent to
trigger a sell-off.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Second 'futures-type'
offering from Citibank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Citibank has launched its second offering of bonds with an embedded futures
fund programme to enhance returns.
The structure is designed to attract investors who are not comfortable with
buying, or not allowed to buy, futures funds outright. Futures funds, which
are highly leveraged, can offer much higher returns than conventional
investments over the long-term, but are also much more volatile, and can
fall rapidly.
The concept is similar to a guaranteed fund. Around 80 per cent of the
proceeds of the offering is used to buy securities issued by AAA-rated
supranational and financial institutions, while the remaining 20 per cent is
invested in a multi-adviser trading account operated by Kenmar Global
Strategies, a trading manager. The programme, which has been operating since
1985, has had an annual compound rate of return of approximately 40 per
cent.
The notes are designed to pay a fixed minimum coupon which declines over the
life of the issue, as the gains from the trading programme kick in. There is
also a maximum coupon level. Any cumulative net trading gains are retained
in the trading account to be reinvested and potentially to enhance the
capital value of the notes.
The three new issues (Keynote US Floating, Keynote US Fixed and Keynote
D-mark), totalling Dollars 150m equivalent, are structured as Eurobonds.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe plans futures only for
Mid 250
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) plans
initially to launch only futures contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 index,
postponing the introduction of options, according to members of the exchange
who have attended recent meetings at Liffe to discuss the matter.
They also said that Liffe is being rushed into an announcement by the
decision of OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, to launch
conventional and flexible futures and options on the index on February 4.
Last November, the London Stock Exchange surprised the market by awarding
both Liffe and OMLX a licence to trade derivatives on the index of
medium-sized UK companies.
Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive confirmed yesterday: 'We are
considering just doing futures. We believe the real interest in this
contract is in the futures.'
Liffe members are expecting an announcement shortly that a futures contract
will be introduced on to the Liffe trading floor in the next month or so.
'If OMLX had not appeared on the scene, Liffe would still be waiting, but
their hand has been forced,' said one member.
Some Liffe members have expressed frustration at Liffe's delay in announcing
its plans for the contract, given the growing activity in the underlying
stock market and the speedy reaction of OMLX. However, others said they
supported Liffe's view that the ground for the new contract needed careful
preparation.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario FRN proves popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market was unanimous in its enthusiasm for the latest debt
offering from the Province of Ontario, which eclipsed most other deals in
yesterday's active session.
Ontario's long-awaited global US dollar FRN, launched only three days after
its CDollars 1.25bn fixed-rate 30-year bond issue, met such strong demand
that it was increased to Dollars 2bn from the initial Dollars 1.5bn in the
early afternoon.
The notes - Ontario's first floaters - have a 5 1/2 -year maturity and were
priced to yield eight basis points above three-month Libor at the re-offer
price. Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch arranged the issue.
The pricing of the deal was seen as appropriate, with some traders
suggesting it could even have been a little tighter. The day's other US
dollar floater was a Dollars 200m five-year issue for Crediop Overseas Bank
via CS First Boston. The notes were priced to yield 23 basis points over
Libor at the re-offer price, which many observers felt was about five basis
points too tight. An official with the lead manager conceded the pricing was
aggressive, adding that 'this was a pre-emptive deal - it gave us an
opportunity to take a position and wait for spreads to come in'.
In the domestic sterling bond market, LAB Investments, a vehicle set up to
acquire and hold registered loan instruments issued by local authorities,
launched Pounds 85m of 25-year bonds via NatWest Capital Markets. According
to the lead manager, the deal met strong demand from UK life assurance
companies and pension funds. The issue is secured by debt issued by the
London Borough of Enfield, Manchester City Council and the City of York. The
bonds were priced to yield 70 basis points over the gilt due 2017; that
spread had narrowed to 68 basis points towards the close.
In the guilder sector, the Republic of Austria issued Fl1bn of 30-year 6.25
per cent bonds yielding 16 basis points over the Dutch 30-year benchmark
bond. The lead manager was ABN Amro Bank.
LKB Baden-Wurttemberg issued L300bn of 7.80 per cent 10-year bonds via
Credito Italiano. While the lira sector continues to suffer from oversupply,
the lead manager reported good buying by Swiss and Italian institutions and
said the deal was helped by the paper's yield pick-up over other, recently
issued lira bonds.
Meanwhile, Portugal is expected to issue an Ecu750m 10-year global bond
early next week, with Banque Paribas, Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley
tipped as joint lead managers. The bonds are expected to yield 30-35 basis
points above the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004.

Mitsui, Japan's second-largest trading house, yesterday cemented another
element in its multi-media ambitions when it signed an agreement with
Network Equipment Technologies, the US telecommunications equipment
manufacturer.
Last year, Mitsui's Adamnet subsidiary began building its multi-media
expertise aimed at providing network services from installation to
management. The deal allows Mitsui to become NET's sole agent in Japan for
three years. The company will invest several million dollars in research and
development to adapt the US technology for Japan.
NET is strong in local area network technology. The company is developing an
expertise in asynchronous transfer mode, which allows for the rapid
transmission of the text, audio and visuals necessary for multi-media
communications.
Mitsui projected sales for the 1994 financial year of Y1bn, and Y4bn within
three years.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Telefonica pre-tax profits rise
7%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonica, Spain's govern-ment-controlled telecommunications group, raised
its parent company's 1993 pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to Pta107.5bn
(Dollars 796m) and claimed it had improved the financial structure of its
balance sheet in spite of slack demand last year.
However, extraordinary provisioning for taxes brought net profits down to
Pta84.7bn, a 1 per cent increase on its 1992 net result.
Telefonica, which is the most liquid stock on the Madrid exchange and is
nearly 30 per cent owned by foreign institutions, earned considerable
one-off fiscal concessions in the run up to Barcelona's Olympic games in
1992.
The group's results, which will incorporate its profitable Telefonica
Internacional division and are due in March, are expected to show a
consolidated net profit rise of 8 per cent according to analysts' forecasts.
The parent company said revenue from telephone services had grown by 5.7 per
cent to Pta1,220bn, the lowest increase for several years. However, the fall
in line usage had been compensated by the growth of new products such as
mobile telephony and data transmission as well as by raised service charges.
In spite of the lowered demand Telefonica strengthened its balance sheet by
reducing its borrowing requirements by more than Pta98bn during 1993 to
bring its outstanding debt down by 5.3 per cent at the year-end and by
adding Pta43bn to capital and reserves, chiefly through the conversion last
year of a 1988 Dollars 200m Euromarket bond issue.
Costs increased by only 2 per cent, three points lower than inflation last
year, due to expenditure control. Cash flow increased 5.2 per cent to
Pta490bn.
The sound balance sheet will help Telefonica face the deregulation challenge
in the years ahead by developing businesses and forging alliances.
Telefonica signed an agreement with Unisource (which incorporates the
Swedish, Swiss and Dutch national telephone companies) last month and it is
examining projects in cable TV and multi-media.
Spain has been granted an extension to the deregulation of
telecommunications in the EC in 1988. But five data transmission licences
were awarded by the government last year and two mobile telephony licences,
one of which will be for Telefonica, are due to be granted later this year.

Chugai, one of Japan's fastest growing drugs groups, yesterday said its
pre-tax profits had increased 16 per cent to Y17bn (Dollars 157.4m) for the
year to December 31.
The improvement, in spite of slack growth of the Japanese domestic market,
was achieved on sales up 5 per cent to Y151bn. The group expects to report
full details in February.
The profits growth was achieved through improved product mix, and in
particular through increased sales of high-margin prescription products,
said Chugai.
The company predicted it would increase its dividend for the year by Y1 to
Y10 per share. Pre-tax profits would increase 6 per cent to Y18bn during
1994 on sales up 6 per cent to Y160bn, it said.
Although costs had risen, sales had increased faster, Chugai said.
CS First Boston in Tokyo said this was part of a wider trend of margin
improvement in the Japanese drugs sector. The introduction last year of
rules limiting excessive promotion to doctors had reduced marketing costs,
according to the broker. It predicted the leading 24 drugs groups would
increase operating profits by 9.7 per cent a year over the next four years.
The drugs group said two products had done particularly well last year.
Epogin, a treatment for anaemia licensed from Genetics Institute of the US,
and Neutrogin, a drug used to increase levels of white blood cells in cancer
patients receiving chemotherapy.
Mr John Wilson, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, estimated
Epogin generated sales last year of Y28.4bn, while sales of Neutrogin were
about Y17.7bn.
The group said sales of over-the-counter non-prescription products had
fallen.
According to analysts, sales of Gronsan, the tonic drink for fatigue, were
likely to have fallen, while those of Alfarol, a vitamin product, had
probably been flat.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Thai Farmers Bank strengthens to
Bt8bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thai Farmers Bank (TFB), Thailand's second largest bank and the first to
report last year's full results, yesterday announced a 52 per cent rise in
net profits to Bt7.94bn (Dollars 313.8m) in 1993 from Bt5.21bn in 1992.
TFB's earnings surpassed the estimates of most stock market analysts, and
the figures suggest that the country's unofficial cartel of 15 commercial
banks has weathered a campaign by the central bank to reduce wide spreads
between banks' lending and deposit rates.
Since the start of last year, Thai banks have lost billions of dollars of
lending business to the Eurobond market, where Thai companies can borrow at
much lower rates than at home.
Thai banks, however, have profited from a very low cost of funds caused by
high liquidity, especially in the fourth quarter of last year, and higher
lending to small customers as the Thai economy grows at about 8 per cent a
year.
TFB's loan book rose 21 per cent to Bt361.96bn last year from Bt299.85bn in
1992, and the company predicted outstanding loans would rise a further 23
per cent this year. Total assets rose 21 per cent last year to Bt441.60bn
from Bt363.61bn in 1992.
Pre-tax profit was up 53 per cent at Bt11.44bn in 1993, compared with
Bt7.48bn the previous year, while earnings per share rose 37 per cent to
Bt9.93 from Bt7.27.
The Thai authorities want to expose Thai banks to more foreign competition
by increasing the opportunities in Thailand for foreign banks with branches
or offshore banking licences. But the process will be gradual enough to
allow domestic banks to improve their efficiency.
'We are not overly worried quite frankly by foreign competition,' said Mr
Chulakorn Singhakowin, president of Bank of Asia, recently. 'I'd like to see
a foreign bank competing profitably in Ubon Ratchathani.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: San Miguel lifted by net capital

San Miguel, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise, has reported
unaudited consolidated net profits for 1993 of 3.9bn pesos (Dollars 139m),
an increase of 8 per cent over the previous year.
The amount included net capital gains from its sale of 50 per cent holdings
in Magnolia Corp, its food subsidiary, to Nestle of Switzerland.
Excluding the non-recurring items, consolidated net income fell by 7 per
cent to 3.4bn pesos, the company said.
Sales volumes improved by 2 per cent. Much of the rise came in the second
half and offset first-half declines caused by soft markets owing to typhoons
that hit the country.
Local sales of beer, San Miguel's main revenue centre, were at a plateau,
although the company's international beer operations expanded into China and
Indonesia.
San Miguel said it was earmarking 10bn pesos this year for expansion and
modernisation.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Dow Chemical optimistic as
deficit is cut to Dollars 48m
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD TOMKINS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Chemical, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported net losses of
Dollars 48m for its fourth quarter because of heavy provisions for
litigation against Dow Corning, the biggest US manufacturer of breast
implants, in which it holds a 50 per cent stake.
However, the deficit marked a sharp improvement from the net losses of
Dollars 250m in the previous year's fourth quarter, and the figures were
accompanied by an upbeat statement about the outlook from Mr Frank Popoff,
chairman and chief executive.
'While many of the challenges facing us will persist in 1994, we expect
earnings to improve because of the company's on-going efforts to enhance
productivity and as a result of recovering world economies and improved
industry fundamentals,' Mr Popoff said.
Dow has been suffering from poor cyclical demand for its products,
particularly from Europe.
Volume was flat in the fourth quarter, but sales were 5 per cent lower at
Dollars 4.5bn because prices fell.
Fourth-quarter earnings benefited from a Dollars 90m pre-tax gain on
investments, but this was heavily outweighed by a Dollars 192m after-tax
provision for litigation against Dow Corning over leaking implants. The
result translated into losses per share of 18 cents, compared with losses of
92 cents last time.
However, Dow said that excluding both unusual items from the latest figures,
and a Dollars 433m charge against the previous year's fourth-quarter pre-tax
profits, the group would have reported earnings per share of 30 cents,
against 10 cents a share last time.
For the full year, Dow reported a 5 per cent drop in sales to Dollars 18.1bn
because of a 4 per cent fall in prices and a 1 per cent fall in volumes.
Net income was Dollars 637m, compared with net losses of Dollars 496m last
time, and earnings per share were Dollars 2.33, against net losses of
Dollars 1.83. But Dow said that if unusual items were stripped out, earnings
per share would have been flat at Dollars 2.02, compared with Dollars 2.01.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Cyprus Amax sees larger savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cyprus Amax Minerals has realised half the Dollars 120m annual savings
predicted when Cyprus and Amax merged in November to form the second-largest
US copper producer and the second-largest coal company.
'We are optimistic that the overall savings from putting the companies
together will create greater economies than anticipated,' says Mr Milt Ward,
chairman, in his statement with the fourth-quarter results. These show that
in the quarter Cyprus Amax had earnings of Dollars 17.2m or 21 cents a share
on revenues of Dollars 541.7m before a merger charge of Dollars 24.9m.
In the 1992 fourth-quarter, the group reported net income of Dollars 18.5m
or 40 cents on revenues of Dollars 407.7m, before reorganisation charges of
Dollars 4.3m. Including the special charges, the loss was Dollars 7.7m or 14
cents, compared with earnings of Dollars 14.2m or 31 cents.
Mr Milt Ward, chairman, said the results were affected by lower copper
prices, partly offset by higher copper sales, lower copper costs and Dollars
6m after-tax insurance proceeds related to flooding in Arizona.
Cyprus Amax reported 1993 earnings of Dollars 100.2m or Dollars 1.85 a share
on revenue of Dollars 1.764bn, compared with a 1992 loss of Dollars 333.6m
or Dollars 8.46 a share on revenue of Dollars 1.64bn.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sentrachem plans R294m rights
issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sentrachem, South Africa's third-largest chemicals producer with yearly
sales of R2.5bn (Dollars 770m), has announced a R294m rights issue to reduce
borrowings and finance local projects.
Mr John Job, managing director, said yesterday the local stock market was
buoyant and Sentrachem needed the money 'in the bag' well before the
country's first non-racial election in April. Otherwise it risked waiting a
long time for suitable market conditions to materialise.
He said the decision to concentrate on upgrading local facilities partly
reflected the collapse of plans to buy Chemplex, the Australian chemicals
group, in 1992 after the Reserve Bank tightened foreign exchange
regulations. Sentrachem was determined to acquire offshore assets and was
making progress with approaches less sensitive to exchange control
constraints.
Sentrachem will issue new shares at 850 cents each, a large discount to the
market price of 975 cents, with some of the cash used to trim long-term
borrowings which stood at R360m at the group's August 1993 year-end. The
group is upgrading facilities and has plans for a citric acid plant and
agricultural chemical feedstock operation, with a combined capital cost of
R150m.
Next year, the group wants to take control of Sanachem, a subsidiary which
exports crop-protection products jointly owned by Farm-Ag, a chemicals
supplier.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: 3M shares hit by stagnant
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3M, the Minnesota-based diversified adhesive, magnetic tape and medical
products manufacturer, marked time in the fourth quarter. The group reported
income for the quarter of Dollars 286m or Dollars 1.33 per share, little
changed from Dollars 289m or Dollars 1.33, a year ago.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 3.4bn the
year earlier.
The company said that while sales volume increased by 8 per cent in the
quarter, selling prices dipped 3 per cent, with the strong US dollar
affecting overseas sales. Currency fluctuations reduced income by an
estimated Dollars 22m, or 10 cents per share.
Mr Giulio Agostini, 3M's chief financial officer, said the company's first
quarter in the next fiscal year might also be flat, or fail to match last
year.
3M's fourth-quarter performance and its cautious comments on earnings sent
the company's shares down Dollars 4 1/8 to close at Dollars 106 7/8 on Wall
Street yesterday.
For the year, 3M's income was Dollars 1.26bn or Dollars 5.82, up from
Dollars 1.23bn or Dollars 5.63 in 1992. Sales for the year were Dollars
14bn, up from Dollars 13.88bn last year.
Mr Agostini said the company's cost-cutting measures were proceeding ahead
of schedule. 3M expected to shed 5,000 jobs by the end of 1995.
The company projects sales growth to continue at a moderate 6 per cent to 7
per cent in 1994.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sales growth lifts Coca-Cola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong sales growth helped Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, increase
earnings per share by 20 per cent for the fourth quarter and 17 per cent for
the year, excluding accounting changes.
Part of that growth was due to share repurchases, which reduced the number
of shares in issue by 14m, or 1 per cent, during the year.
Since 1984, Coca-Cola has repurchased 429m shares - 26 per cent of those
outstanding.
Unit case volume rose by 5 per cent in the US for the quarter and the year,
while international volume grew by 7 per cent for the quarter and 9 per cent
for the year. (A unit case contains 24 8oz servings.)
Fourth-quarter turnover increased to Dollars 3.37bn from Dollars 3.24bn. Net
income rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 466m from Dollars 392m and earnings
per share rose to 36 cents from 30 cents
For the year, turnover advanced to Dollars 13.96bn from Dollars 13.07bn.
Excluding unusual items, net income rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 2.19bn
from Dollars 1.88bn and earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.68 from Dollars
1.43 - though if a Dollars 219m charge for accounting changes to 1992
earnings were included, the increase in net income would have been 31 per
cent.
Coca-Cola said if unusual items were stripped out, full-year net income
would have been up 19 per cent at Dollars 2.23bn and earnings per share 20
per cent ahead at Dollars 1.71.

The Canadian government is to allow Air Canada to move into the Japanese
market in direct competition with rival Canadian International, while
raising the possibility of new routes later for Canadian.
Air Canada said it would begin flying into the new Kansai airport, Osaka,
when it opens in September. It originally wanted Tokyo, but Narita airport
is saturated.
Both airlines want more Asian destinations, saying too much Asia-Canada
traffic is being taken by US Airlines.
Air Canada said Hong Kong is its first priority, and then new routes to
China.
In Calgary Canadian International said a CDollars 246m (USDollars 187.7m)
equity infusion from American Airlines will be in place this spring, so that
the parent PWA's financial restructuring can go ahead.

Wall Street celebrated McDonald's Corporation's Dollars 1bn 1993 earnings by
pushing the hamburger chain's stock to its highest price in a year, Dollars
60.
The world's largest fast-food company reported fourth-quarter net income of
Dollars 264.5m or 72 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 6.1bn. That
compares to net income of Dollars 227.9m or 61 cents per share on sales of
Dollars 5.7bn a year ago.
For the year, McDonald's had net income of Dollars 1.08bn or Dollars 2.91
per share on sales of Dollars 24bn, up from fiscal 1992's earnings of
Dollars 958m or Dollars 2.60 per share on sales of Dollars 21.8bn.
The company added 900 restaurants to its 14,000-unit chain during 1993.
McDonald's does not disclose comparative results excluding new restaurant
additions.
Operating income within the US grew at a moderate 4 per cent for the year
and 5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while operating income in McDonald's
markets outside the US grew by 9 per cent for the year and 10 per cent in
the fourth quarter.
A large portion of the company's restaurant expansion occurred outside the
US in 1993, leading to the higher overseas growth rate.

BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group, suffered a fourth-quarter loss
of CDollars 532m (USDollars 405m), or CDollars 1.73 per common share.
This compared with profit of CDollars 505m, or CDollars 1.65, a year
earlier, on revenues of CDollars 5.6bn, little changed.
The loss, which had been expected, reflected heavy one-off charges,
including BCE's share of write-downs at its Northern Telecom subsidiary.
For the full year, BCE recorded a loss of CDollars 750m, or CDollars 2.44,
against a profit of CDollars 1.29bn, or CDollars 4.21, a year earlier.
Revenues were CDollars 19.8bn, up slightly.
For the year, BCE also took heavy losses on discontinued operations,
including two property units and the sale of Montreal Trustco.
The contribution of BCE's main business unit, 100 per cent-owned Bell
Canada, was lower for the year because of the recession.
Profits at Shell Canada dropped to CDollars 5m, or 5 cents a share, after
special items in the fourth quarter of 1993, from CDollars 92m or 83 cents a
year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.23bn, little changed.
For the full year, final profit was CDollars 18m, or 16 cents a share,
against CDollars 80m, or 72 cents, on revenues of CDollars 4.7bn, against
CDollars 4.5bn.
The company has brought its Caroline natural gas field into production in
Alberta, and paid CDollars 240m for two downstream acquisitions.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cummins, the US diesel engine manufacturer, capitalised on the improving
North American market for heavy-duty trucks by nearly doubling its profit in
the fourth quarter.
The Indiana-based company yesterday revealed net income of Dollars 47.1m, or
Dollars 1.26 a share, for the final three months of last year.
The result compares with net income of Dollars 24m, or 63 cents, in the
corresponding period of 1992.
In both quarters, the company took a Dollars 5.5m charge for the early
retirement of debt.
The sharp rise in profits, up 96 per cent year-on-year, reflected more than
just solid growth in revenues, which climbed about 10 per cent to Dollars
1.12bn, against Dollars 1.02bn a year earlier.
The North American truck industry has completed a banner year in which
output jumped by 33 per cent, a rise that filled Cummins's order book to
near capacity.
This saw improved efficiency and higher productivity during a year in which
the company held its position as the market's leading supplier, with a 35
per cent share.
Sales of power-generation equipment, the company's second-largest business,
and mid-range engines were also buoyant.
For the full year, Cummins posted net earnings of Dollars 177.1m, or Dollars
4.79 a share, reversing a net loss of Dollars 189.5m, or Dollars 6.01, in
1992.
Last year's result, however, included one-time charges of Dollars 256.6m for
the adoption of new accounting standards and other costs.
On an operating basis, 1993 earnings were Dollars 182.6m, against Dollars
67.1m in the previous 12 months.
Annual sales of Dollars 4.2bn were a 14 per cent improvement over 1992
revenues of Dollars 3.7bn.
International sales, as a percentage of the total, slipped by 2 points to 44
per cent, largely because of sluggish conditions in Mexico and most of
Europe, with the exception of the UK.
By contrast, sales in the Asia Pacific region were well ahead of 1992
levels.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mixed fortunes for United, Delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a sharp
reduction in net losses to Dollars 64m from Dollars 224m for its fourth
quarter, leaving net losses for the full year at Dollars 50m, compared with
Dollars 957m last time.
Delta Air Lines, in contrast, reported net losses of Dollars 141m for its
second quarter ended in December, almost unchanged from the previous year's
loss of Dollars 144.4m.
Delta said the losses would have been half that size without the inclusion
of a Dollars 112.3m pre-tax charge for the early retirement of 1,492 staff.
Delta also reported that if its financial year had run from January to
December 1993, it would have turned in net losses of Dollars 225.9m - a big
drop from the previous calendar year's losses of Dollars 601.4m before
accounting changes and Dollars 1.19bn after the changes.
One factor helping both airlines during the quarter was the flight
attendants' strike at their biggest rival, American Airlines, in November.
They also benefited from the fall in oil prices.
But like other large US airlines, United and Delta suffered tough
competition on domestic short-haul routes from low-cost competitors such as
Southwest Airlines.
Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman and chief executive, said that although
the fourth-quarter and full-year figures showed a vast improvement over the
previous year's, United was 'far from satisfied with what must be
characterised as unacceptable results.'
Last month United negotiated a deal with unions giving employees a majority
stake in the airline in exchange for wage cuts and productivity
improvements.
'The provisions included in the employee stock ownership transaction
specifically address our need to compete effectively in short-haul markets,
while at the same time allowing us to reduce labour costs throughout our
world-wide system,' Mr Wolf said.
United's fourth-quarter revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn from
Dollars 3.2bn and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.02 from Dollars 9.27.
For the full year, revenues rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 14.5bn from
Dollars 12.9bn, and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.40 from Dollars 39.75
 -though the previous year's full-year figure included an after-tax charge
of Dollars 540m for accounting changes.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said the airline had cut
7,235 staff, or 10 per cent of its workforce, since 1992, and had cut
Dollars 7.3bn from planned capital spending between now and 1996 by
deferring aircraft deliveries.
Second-quarter turnover rose to Dollars 3bn from Dollars 2.9bn and losses
per share fell to Dollars 3.36 from Dollars 3.46.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: VME back in the black with
Dollars 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VME Group, the Brussels-based construction equipment producer, came back
into the black last year with net income of Dollars 30m, compared with a net
loss of Dollars 93.6m in 1992.
The company, jointly owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US,
said the turnround reflected a group-wide restructuring programme, together
with the effects of the floating of the Swedish krone.
Net income last year included Dollars 9.3m of gains from accounting changes
relating to tax and pension benefits, while 1992 included a restructuring
charge of Dollars 18.7m.
The recovery came in spite of a 9 per cent decline in sales from Dollars
1.36bn in 1992 to Dollars 1.23bn last year.
VME said demand for construction equipment remained weak in most European
countries, but there were signs of recovery in the UK. The important German
market declined significantly from its exceptionally strong performance in
1992. Markets in North America, Latin America and the Far East, excluding
Japan, also showed signs of recovery.
Clark Equipment this week reported fourth-quarter net profits of Dollars
18.4m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, against a loss of Dollars 2.78m, or 16
cents, a year earlier.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Low prices take toll on Kaiser
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kaiser Aluminum, the US aluminium smelter and producer of aluminium
products, suffered a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 82m, or
Dollars 1.42 a share. This compares with an operating gain of Dollars 4.4m
or 7 cents per share in the previous fourth quarter.
Sales for the quarter dipped to Dollars 415.9m, from Dollars 496m a year
ago.
For the year, Kaiser recorded an operating loss of Dollars 123.4m, or
Dollars 2.15, compared with operating income of Dollars 89.9m, or Dollars
1.57, in fiscal 1992.
Sales for the year were Dollars 1.7bn, down from Dollars 1.9bn a year ago.
Although Kaiser, like most other US aluminium producers, reduced plant
capacity and engaged in other cost-cutting measures in 1993, low prices,
created by worldwide oversupply, battered the company's results, said Mr
George Haymaker, chairman.
Kaiser is 67-per cent owned by the Houston-based natural resources company,
Maxxam. Although Maxxam's forest products division made Dollars 12.9m
profits in the fourth quarter, overall results were swamped by Kaiser's
losses.
Maxxam reported a net fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 63.4m, or Dollars 6.71,
on sales of Dollars 503m, compared with a loss of Dollars 10.3m, or Dollars
1.09, on sales of Dollars 576.5m a year ago.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Armco and Kawasaki Steel, the US and Japanese steel companies, are planning
to float their US joint venture, Armco Steel, as part of a Dollars 590m
recapitalisation of the heavily indebted company.
The transaction will in effect wipe out the two companies' existing equity
interest in the joint venture, which produces flat-rolled steel for the
auto, appliance and construction industries.
The financing is among the largest of a series of recapitalisations by steel
producers in recent months. Companies have taken advantage of an upturn in
their shares to return to the public markets.
It also marks a decision by Armco and Kawasaki not to commit further capital
to their joint venture, which has racked up losses of more than Dollars 800m
since the beginning of 1990. The company returned to profit in the third
quarter of last year.
The two partners plan to raise Dollars 315m of new equity for Armco Steel to
pay off much of its existing debt and reduce its pension fund deficit.
According to a filing in the US, the flotation will involve 15.75m shares at
around Dollars 20 each, equivalent to more than 75 per cent of the company's
equity after recapitalisation.
In addition, Kawasaki will exchange Dollars 100m of subordinated debt owed
it by Armco Steel for 5m shares in the newly capitalised company, giving it
a 24 per cent stake.
The current equity in the company will be all but extinguished in the
transaction, reducing Armco's existing 50 per cent interest to less than 1
per cent.
Armco Steel also plans to raise Dollars 275m of new long-term debt, leaving
it with Dollars 412m of long-term debt after the recapitalisation has been
completed.

<TEXT>
Brazil has completed the sale of a controlling stake in Petroquimica, the
first of several petrochemical companies due to be privatised this year.
The auction, which had already been delayed five times and cancelled once
mainly for technical reasons, was declared a success after meeting the
government's requirement that at least 75 per cent of the shares on offer be
subscribed.
At this week's auction on the Rio de Janeiro exchange bids were received for
80 per cent of the shares on offer, raising gross proceeds of over Dollars
330m for the government.
PQU was 68 per cent owned by a subsidiary of Petrobras, the
government-controlled oil monopoly.
Following the auction, Petrobras' stake has fallen to about 20 per cent,
while employees hold 10 per cent.
The company's main shareholders are now Unipar, a chemicals company
controlled by Odebrecht, the chemicals and construction group, and PQU's
main customers such as Shell, petrol distributor Ipiranga and Union Carbide.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Procter advances 13% to Dollars
653m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group which last summer embarked
on a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000 jobs, yesterday reported that
strong sales growth at home and abroad had led to a 13 per cent increase in
net income to Dollars 653m for its second quarter.
The figures for the first half of its financial year were well ahead, with
net earnings 12 per cent up at Dollars 1.32bn excluding accounting changes
and restructuring provisions on the 1992 figures.
Most of the costs of the reorganisation were taken the previous year.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, said the group's US consumer
business had continued to deliver strong volume gains, including record
shipments in December.
The international operations had achieved double-digit volume growth in
spite of difficult economic conditions in many markets, with Asia Pacific,
Latin America and eastern Europe doing particularly well.
Mr Artzt said the US and international businesses had showed good earnings
growth, 'due in part to our restructuring programme, which is just beginning
to contribute to our earnings progress'.
Sales in the quarter to December were slightly down to Dollars 7.79bn from
Dollars 7.84bn.
However, Procter &amp; Gamble said this reflected adverse shifts in dollar
exchange rates. Without those shifts, sales would have been 3 per cent
ahead.
Earnings per share for the quarter rose 14 per cent to 92 cents from 81
cents.
For the six months to December, turnover was 2.3 per cent down at Dollars
15.35bn, but earnings per share were 12 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.87.

Sara Lee, the US food and household goods group, yesterday announced record
sales and earnings for the second quarter to January 1 1994, but said
results for the third quarter would be below analyst estimates, agencies
report.
Mr John Bryan, chairman, blamed softness in European hosiery and knit
products operations and weaker-than-expected trends for US hosiery and knit
products.
However, earnings for the full year are expected to rise to record levels.
Last year, earnings per share were Dollars 1.40.
Net sales for the second quarter were Dollars 4bn, against Dollars 3.8bn
last year, while net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 236m from
Dollars 220m. Earnings per share increased to 48 cents from 44 cents a year
ago.
For the half year, net income advanced 8 per cent to Dollars 391m against
Dollars 362m before an accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal
1994.
Half-year sales were Dollars 7.8bn, up 5 per cent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: UAL chief 'far from satisfied'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a sharp
reduction in fourth-quarter net losses to Dollars 64m from Dollars 224m,
leaving net losses for the full year at Dollars 50m, compared with Dollars
957m last time.
One factor contributing to the improvement was the flight attendants' strike
at one of its biggest rivals, American Airlines, last November.
United also benefited from the fall in oil prices, which reduced the cost of
aviation fuel.
But like the other US airlines, United is continuing to suffer tough
competition on its domestic short-haul routes from low-cost competitors,
such as Southwest Airlines.
Last month it negotiated a deal with its unions giving employees a majority
stake in United in exchange for wage cuts and productivity improvements
aimed at improving its competitiveness.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, said that although the
fourth-quarter and full-year figures showed a vast improvement over the
previous year, United was 'far from satisfied with what must be
characterised as unacceptable results'.
'Further, an analysis by market shows that on domestic short-haul routes, we
continue to report our most severe losses due principally to the rapid
expansion of low-cost carriers and the clear preference of consumers for low
fares.'
Fourth-quarter revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn from Dollars
3.2bn, and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.02 from Dollars 9.27.
For the year, revenues rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 14.5bn from Dollars
12.9bn and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.40 from Dollars 39.75 - though
the previous year's full-year figure included an after-tax charge of Dollars
540m for accounting changes.

improvement

<TEXT>
General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, revealed improved
fourth-quarter operating earnings in spite of a sharp downturn in revenues.
Net income on continuing operations was Dollars 64m, or Dollars 2.02 a
share, on sales of Dollars 779m.
In the corresponding period of 1992, comparable net earnings were Dollars
60m, or Dollars 1.93 a share, after stripping out a Dollars 95m tax credit
and an after-tax gain of Dollars 14m on the sale of securities.
Earnings in the 1992 period were struck on sales of Dollars 911m. This was
about 13 per cent greater than the comparable 1993 figure.
Results for both periods exclude contributions by the company's space
systems division, which General Dynamics agreed last month to sell to Martin
Marietta for Dollars 208.5m in cash.
Mr James Mellor, president and chief executive, said the company's long-term
outlook had improved.
'Our low debt and year-end cash balance of Dollars 585m provide us with
liquidity and financial capacity to build the value of General Dynamics
going forward,' Mr Mellor said.
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were Dollars 270m on
sales of Dollars 3.2bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 305m and
marginally higher sales a year earlier.
Total net earnings in 1993 were Dollars 885m, including a Dollars 645m gain
on the sale of the aircraft business. In 1992, net earnings totalled Dollars
815m, including a gain of Dollars 374 on the sale of a variety of smaller
operations.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Canadian airlines end dispute
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air Canada has called off its two-year fight with rival Canadian
International Airlines, saying 'it is time for both of us to move forward
and focus on rebuilding our industry'.
Air Canada said it was ending all litigation 'that would preclude' PWA,
Canadian's parent company, from concluding a CDollars 246m (USDollars 187m)
deal with AMR, parent of American Airlines.
AMR had insisted Canadian withdraw from the Gemini ticket reservation system
and join its own Sabre system as a condition of injecting CDollars 246m
equity.
But Air Canada, a co-founder of Gemini with PWA, maintained Canadian
Airlines was contracted as a Gemini shareholder until 1997.
Air Canada would not add to the statement. But the industry said it meant
the court battle over Canadian's membership in the Gemini reservation system
was over.
At the same time , the federal government said it would soon announce
arrangements for Air Canada to have access to Japan and Hong Kong - two
destinations already served by Canadian.
Air Canada had failed to persuade the public that it should become the sole
Canadian international carrier and Canadian Airlines should 'concentrate on
the domestic market', said Mr Stephen Garmaise, analyst with First Marathon
Securities in Toronto.
'We'll continue to have two international carriers and Canadian may be ready
to pay CDollars 10m to CDollars 20m to exit from Gemini.'
PWA recently won renewal of CDollars 100m in government loan guarantees. A
deal with Air Canada and the equity infusion would allow it to move ahead
with a financial restructuring, with massive dilution facing existing
stockholders.

<TEXT>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the leading US long-distance telephone
company, yesterday reported a 15 per cent increase in fourth quarter income
before special items, while MCI Communications, its smaller rival, announced
a 24 per cent rise.
AT&amp;T's results were helped by cost-cutting in long-distance and strong
growth in its network equipment business, while MCI was boosted by
long-distance volume growth of nearly 16 per cent, roughly double the
industry average.
AT&amp;T made Dollars 982m, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter, after
previously announced restructuring charges at its NCR computer subsidiary
and a non-cash change in accounting methods. This compared with net income
of Dollars 1bn, or 75 cents a share, in the same period of last year.
Revenues rose 5.5 per cent to Dollars 18.46bn. Excluding the charges, net
income totalled Dollars 1.15bn, or 85 cents a share.
NCR, which the group is renaming AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, reported
a 20 per cent rise in sales of computer products and equipment, while its
total revenues rose 7 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. Excluding Dollars 190m of
pre-tax restructuring charges, it had operating income of Dollars 61m.
For the full year, excluding accounting and restructuring charges, the group
reported net income of Dollars 4.26bn, or Dollars 3.15 a share, on revenues
of Dollars 67.16bn, compared with income of Dollars 3.81bn, or Dollars 2.86
a share, on revenues of Dollars 64.9bn in 1992.
MCI reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 107m, or 18 cents a share,
down from Dollars 160m, or 30 cents, in the same period of last year, after
taking a Dollars 150m realignment charge. Excluding the provision, earnings
rose to Dollars 199m, or 34 cents a share. Revenues rose more than 13 per
cent to Dollars 3.13bn, while traffic rose 16 per cent.
For the full year, MCI reported earnings excluding charges of Dollars 731m,
or Dollars 1.30 a share, up from Dollars 1.11 in 1992.

<TEXT>
Salomon Inc, the New York investment banking group with a volatile earnings
record, yesterday announced fourth-quarter net income more than tripled as
it shared in a record-breaking year for the US securities industry.
Net income was Dollars 476m, or Dollars 3.64 a share, up from Dollars 143m,
or Dollars 1.06, in the same period of 1992, helped by a strong profits
surge in investment banking and a good quarter in proprietary, or
own-account, trading.
Salomon Brothers, the group's core investment banking business, reported
pre-tax earnings of Dollars 862m, up from Dollars 503m. Phibro, the energy
and commodity trading division, recorded a loss of Dollars 21m, down from a
deficit of Dollars 181m in the final quarter of 1992.
Salomon's figures surprised analysts who had been expecting earnings per
share around Dollars 1.50 and its shares closed up Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars
48 1/4 .
'Client-driven businesses,' which include investment banking and commission
income, had pre-tax earnings of Dollars 354m, up from Dollars 115m in the
same period of 1992.
'Customer trading activities in the fourth quarter were strong and record
investment banking revenues were generated for the third consecutive
quarter,' the group said.
Salomon's results tend to be more volatile than other Wall Street houses
because of its heavy reliance on proprietary trading.
In the fourth quarter this business reported pre-tax profits of Dollars
508m, against Dollars 482m in the same period of 1992 and a Dollars 173m
loss in the third quarter.
In 1993 as a whole, Salomon made Dollars 416m from proprietary trading, down
from Dollars 1.4bn in 1992. Client-driven income soared from Dollars 276m to
Dollars 1.2bn, which Mr Denham attributed to management changes as well as
market conditions.
For the full year, Salomon Inc reported net income of Dollars 827m, or
Dollars 6.28, up from Dollars 550m, or Dollars 4.05, in 1992. Return on
equity, before an accounting charge, was 19 per cent, up from 13 per cent.
The fourth-quarter figures also included a pre-tax charge of Dollars 30m by
Phibro USA, the oil refining business, to write down the inventories to
year-end market prices.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Usinor losses double to FFr5.8bn

<TEXT>
Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, more than doubled its
losses last year to FFr5.8bn (Dollars 970m) according to provisional results
announced yesterday by the company.
The losses illustrate the weak financial state of some of the companies
slated for privatisation by the French government.
The announcement coincided with confirmation that Air France suffered a loss
of about FFr7.5bn in 1993 and follows an order from the European Commission
that the French government freeze capital payments to Groupe Bull, the
loss-making computer group. All three companies are on the list of 21 groups
selected for privatisation.
The downturn at Usinor Sacilor, from FFr2.4bn in 1992, was blamed on a
several factors, from the depressed state of demand and prices in the steel
industry to the costs of restructuring measures.
Mr Francis Mer, chairman, said steel consumption in France had fallen by 13
per cent last year and that the impact of recession on demand and prices had
been exacerbated by overcapacity, excess production, and the failure of the
EC to restructure its steel industry. The reduction in steel prices prompted
sales to fall by about 13 per cent to FFr75.4bn.
Mr Mer described 1993 as 'a black year' for the industry. He said Usinor
Sacilor had suffered more than many of its competitors because of the
relatively sharp decline in demand from French industry and the effects of
currency depreciation in several countries, in particular Italy and Spain.
Usinor Sacilor said it had taken extraordinary costs of FFr2.2bn relating to
the failure last May of Saarstahl, the German steel producer, which was
controlled through a holding company by the French group. These costs,
however, were offset by gains relating to a change in accounting practices
for renovation of its furnaces.
Despite the sharp rise in losses, Mr Mer pointed to several encouraging
signs. He said that economic recovery in Europe, albeit gradual, and
increased demand in the US and Asia, would combine with the group's
cost-cutting measures to improve results this year. The group forecast
losses would be reduced to about FFr2bn. Debts are also shrinking, to
FFr24.4bn from FFr29.5bn in 1992, partly as a result of reduced investments.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, said investments at Air
France would also be reduced as part of the its restructuring plans.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Thyssen faces doubts over
recovery

<TEXT>
Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, has reported weak domestic
orders in the first quarter of its 1993-94 fiscal year, raising doubts about
the group's recovery this year.
Total orders in the three months to December 31 1993 fell 5 per cent with
the figure for European Union down 13 per cent. Orders for Thyssen
Industrie, the capital goods division, dropped by 16 per cent, reflecting
mainly poor market conditions in the car industry. The sharpest drop was in
machinery which fell by 38 per cent.
The group did not disclose first quarter financial results, but said
turnover had improved 1.2 per cent over the same period the previous year,
mostly due to foreign subsidiaries. Turnover in Thyssen Stahl, the steel
division, was down 7 per cent and in Thyssen Industrie by 10 per cent.
Steel losses forced Thyssen into the red for the year ended September 30
1993. It returned a DM864m (Dollars 493.7m) loss, after DM348m pre-tax
profits the year before. Without the steel division, the group would have
recorded an operating profit of DM774m, Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive,
said. Thyssen will omit a dividend.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Trading in Banesto to resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's Stock Exchange Commission said yesterday that trading in Banesto,
the banking group in which the authorities intervened to impose a new
management at the end of last month, would be resumed on Tuesday next week.
The decision could indicate that the Bank of Spain and the leading domestic
banks were near agreement on a rescue plan for the troubled group.
The chairmen of the top five banks are due to meet the governor of the Bank
of Spain and Banesto's acting president today - the second such meeting in
the space of four days - and details of Banesto's salvage are likely to be
officially disclosed on Monday.
The commission said it made its decision after being informed by Banesto
that its gross financing needs were Pta605bn (Dollars 4.27bn) and that, as
part of the plan to recapitalise the group, the par value of Banesto's
shares would be reduced from a present Pta750 to 'less than' Pta500.
The rescue plan for Banesto being discussed calls for a capital increase of
not more than Pta200bn to be underwritten by the leading domestic banks and
held on their behalf by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the official agency
charged with salvaging bankrupt banks.
Banesto is thought to have told the commission that the domestic financial
sector, comprising both the private banks and the Bank of Spain, would also
provide Pta285bn to acquire Banesto's non-performing loans and that Banesto
would set aside all its reserves to provisions.
But there is disagreement over the final figure of the capital injection,
and over the burden that will be placed on Banesto's existing shareholders
through a reduction in the nominal price of their shares.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: BMW forecasts improvement
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, the luxury car, motorcycle and aero-engine maker, yesterday forecast an
improved performance this year after making a clear profit in 1993.
The group, which has already said it will not match 1992's earnings of
DM726m, blamed exchange rate losses and a 9.2 per cent drop in new car
registrations for the 7.5 per cent fall in turnover to DM28.9bn (Dollars
16.5bn)
Boasting in a letter to shareholders that it was the only German vehicle
maker to get through last year without short-time working and to make a
profit into the bargain, it said it did not expect a lasting improvement in
the world car market this year.
Car production fell 11 per cent last year to 533,000 units, compared with a
23 per cent slump in the German industry's total output. West European BMW
registrations fell 15 per cent to 375,000 due to a 17 per cent decline in
Germany.
Even so, the group sold more than 200,000 vehicles in its home market and
won market share, especially for its top price models, the letter said.
There was some compensation in the US, where the marque became the
best-selling European brand for the first time with a 19 per cent rise in
sales to 78,000 units.
While Japanese registrations fell 10 per cent to 25,800, deliveries in other
south-east Asian markets rose 30 per cent to 18,000 units.
Forecasts for the current year were based on the prospect of only slightly
improved global economic conditions. The US recovery was expected to
continue, and a slight upswing was predicted for Europe and Japan.
German demand would be dampened by falling real incomes, and exports would
feel the effects of the continuing high value of the D-Mark.

VWD-Vereinigte Wirtschafts-dienste, a leading German financial news agency,
has been bought by a consortium of German and US publishers.
The buyers are Dow Jones, the US information group which owns the Wall
Street Journal, and the two German companies which publish the Handelsblatt,
a daily business newspaper, and the Frankfurter Allgemeiner, Germany's most
influential daily newspaper.
The buyers are taking a third each of the company which last year generated
revenues of DM40.8m (Dollars 23.3m), 70 per cent of which came from
electronically distributed services. The shares were previously owned by the
Deutsche Presse-Agentur, another news agency, and two other companies.
The new shareholders said they would strengthen and develop VWD's position
as Germany's leading news agency for finance and business. As part of the
transaction VWD has signed an agreement with Dow Jones covering the supply
and exchange of financial news. This would secure VWD's sourcing of news
over the long term, the agency said.
No details of the price were given but the issued share capital is to be
increased.

FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bosch turnover suffers downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Bosch, the electronics and vehicle parts maker, made a net profit
last year despite operating losses and the first fall in turnover in 26
years.
The private concern, which earned DM512m on sales of DM34.4bn in 1992, said
yesterday that turnover declined 6 per cent to DM32.3bn (Dollars 18.4bn).
All business sectors were affected, it added.
No earnings details were given for 1993, but the positive result was mainly
attributable to noticeably improved results from foreign business and a tax
credit associated with last year's capital increase from DM1.2bn to DM1.5bn,
the company said.
Bosch, one of the stricken German automotive industry's biggest suppliers,
said that while foreign sales remained virtually unchanged at DM16bn,
domestic turnover fell 11 per cent to DM16.3bn.
Despite continuing unsatisfactory market conditions, it was cautiously
optimistic that sales would rise this year. However, an important
precondition for positive progress was a pay settlement which helped cut
German manufacturing's considerable cost disadvantages.
Pay negotiations with the IG Metall union, which has threatened to start
warning strikes next week, appeared to be deadlocked yesterday.
Two thirds of last year's 13,000 job cuts were made in Germany, and
reductions in bonuses, benefits and other extra payments saved some DM250m.
Further economies came from a cut of DM400m to DM1.6bn in capital
expenditure, while spending on research and development was unchanged at
DM2.3bn.
In common with other companies heavily dependent on the automotive industry,
Bosch is working to extend its manufacturing and distribution networks into
developing foreign markets.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Northern Electric in joint venture for N
Sea reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric, the Newcastle-based electricity distributor, has formed a
joint venture with Neste, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals company,
to own North Sea gas reserves.
The 50:50 joint venture, Sovereign Exploration, is valued initially at
Pounds 19m, though the companies estimate that the potential exists to
enhance this by Pounds 5m. Northern said the rate of return it expected to
receive from the venture would exceed that on its main electricity business.
The deal will underpin Northern's ambitions to become an integrated gas
supplier. Last autumn it launched its own distribution business. This
currently has 100 customers, but is intended to serve the full range of the
gas market as it becomes liberalised.
The deal gives Northern access to long-term gas supplies with an option to
buy up to 50m therms of uncommitted gas. For Neste, the deal represents a
step in its corporate restructuring and an opportunity to link up with a
company in the downstream market.
Sovereign Exploration will have interests in the Schooner, Avalon and Victor
fields.
Mr David Morris, Northern's chairman, said: 'We are looking at further
options and opportunities to expand our gas business, following a low risk
approach to ensure profitable business development.'

(0.25p).

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Partridge recovers to Pounds 1.77m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Partridge Fine Arts, the antique dealer, reported pre-tax profits ahead from
Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 1.77m in the year to October 31. Turnover advanced to
Pounds 13.7m, against Pounds 8.36m, the highest since the 1989-90 year.
Mr John Partridge, chairman, spoke of a return of confidence, with recent
auctions showing considerable demand for the finest pieces with strong
prices.
However, there was some way to go before there was a lasting effect on the
market.
Earnings per share came out at 5.54p (3.25p). A proposed final dividend of
1.5p makes a total of 2.7p (2.25p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prism Leisure, the USM-quoted computer games and music group, lifted interim
pre-tax profits by 35 per cent and forecast a 'significant advance' in the
full-year result. The shares rose 5p to 183p.
Profit for the 27 weeks to October 2 amounted to Pounds 649,000 compared
with Pounds 478,000 last time and Pounds 1.33m for the previous full year.
Turnover was 26 per cent higher at Pounds 7.65m.
Earnings per share showed a 29 per cent rise from 3.8p to 4.9p; the interim
dividend is lifted by 28 per cent from 0.9p to 1.15p.
Directors said a principal area of growth was increased turnover in the
wholesale distribution and merchandising of computer games. Sales on the
audio and video side showed a slight decline.
They reported that trade was good in the Christmas quarter, particularly for
computer games. Paul Lamond Games, the board game division, showed
encouraging initial trading and was expected to make a positive contribution
to full-year results.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Chiroscience to join market with Pounds
102m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience Group, the latest biotechnology issue to come to the market,
yesterday set its flotation share price at 150p, giving a capitalisation of
Pounds 102m.
Although the Cambridge-based group does not expect to make a profit for
several years while it develops new drugs, Mr Peter Keen, finance director,
said investor interest had exceeded expectations.
He claimed Chiroscience had attracted attention because, unlike most
biotechnology companies, it had offset losses on its research programme with
product sales to companies such as Glaxo.
In the six months to August 31 sales of Pounds 1.34m helped hold interim
losses at Pounds 1.37m.
Funds from the flotation and income from sales of so-called synthons - the
chemical building blocks purchased by large drugs companies - would be used
'to develop the full potential of chiral technology'.
Research aims to develop single isomer drugs, which work faster and with
fewer side effects than twin isomer products.
Mr Keen said revenues from the issue, together with cash reserves of Pounds
6.9m, would be used to market existing products, enlarge the workforce and
expand site facilities.
The flotation of 30m ordinary shares is expected to raise Pounds 45m, of
which Pounds 5m will be realised by venture capital companies from the sale
of 3.33m shares.
Of the Pounds 40m retained by the company, Pounds 4m will be used to finance
an employee share trust, which has conditionally agreed to purchase a
substantial equity stake from other venture capital shareholders.
Robert Fleming is placing 16.7m shares with institutions, with the balance
available to private investors.
COMMENT
It takes a bold company to lay claim to a market valuation of Pounds 102m
less than two years after it emerged from a Pounds 1m management buy-out.
Yet that is what Chiroscience has done. In March 1992 it paid Pounds 1m cash
for the chiral business of Enzymatix. Analysts, who had been expecting a
market capitalisation of about Pounds 80m, described the valuation as
'surprising'. They warn that even if the company's innovative research
techniques begin to generate profits in five years' time, it will be a long
wait for investors seeking capital growth. Nevertheless, Chiroscience is one
of the few companies developing single isomer drugs which, if they fulfil
their promise, could revolutionise parts of the pharmaceutical industry. But
it could take several years for the drugs to realise their full potential.
At 150p, the shares are not expected to open at a premium.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant Christmas sales at Farepak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farepak, the mail order supplier of Christmas hampers, yesterday reported a
16 per cent increase in sales over the festive season.
The statement accompanied news of an increased deficit of Pounds 1.53m
(Pounds 1.39m) pre-tax in the first half to October 31.
Turnover fell marginally to Pounds 8.08m (Pounds 8.11m), primarily due to a
later distribution schedule for mail order giftware, which will be booked in
the second half.
Farepak has a highly seasonal business, with profits coming through during
the Christmas period. Mr Bob Johnson, chairman, said: 'We are confident that
the full year will show good growth'.
The company purchased the Littlewoods hamper business and access to its
substantial mail order database, the second largest in the UK, for Pounds
8.5m in April last year. Benefits are expected to come through in the year
to April 1995 as it increases marketing and secures synergies with its
existing mail order hamper business.
The company has expanded its manufacturing base with a new plant in Swindon
and has seen increased orders for its wholesale food processing business.
The interim dividend goes up 12 per cent to 1.85p (1.65p).

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Misys advances 19% to Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A continued advance of software sales and recurring revenues helped Misys,
the computer services group, lift interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.76m
to Pounds 8.01m.
The 19 per cent improvement for the six months to November 30 was achieved
on turnover which grew to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 41.1m) helped by a Pounds
407,000 contribution from acquisitions.
The modest increase in turnover disguised the beneficial change in the mix
of sales with the growth of software sales and recurring revenues more than
offsetting the decline in lower-margin hardware sales.
Earnings per share increased by 20 per cent to 14.3p (11.9p) and the interim
dividend is lifted by 15 per cent to 3p (2.61p).
Although the results were broadly in line with market expectations, the
shares closed 11p lower at 537p.
At the operating level the improved mix of revenues coupled with the
benefits of the reorganisation put in place at the end of the last financial
year resulted in a 23 per cent increase in profits before group charges.
The advance was underpinned by the expanded financial services division
which now contributes over 50 per cent of group operating profits. The
Countrywide businesses acquired in mid-1992 performed particularly well
assisted by pressure for the consolidation of business within the
independent insurance broking sector.
Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said that Misys' financial services division
continued to increase its market share in the life insurance sector.
Overall, the division lifted its profits to Pounds 4.79m (Pounds 4.03m) on
turnover of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 11.2m) despite higher research and
development expenditure.
Within the systems division Mr Lomax said the computer services operations
continued to make a valuable, but slightly reduced, contribution to group
profits.
COMMENT
The chairman's comments about the lack of clear signs of a sustained upturn
in capital spending may have contributed to the share price slippage
yesterday. But even allowing for the cautious outlook, Misys looks like an
undervalued high quality technology stock with a solid balance sheet, good
management and an up-to-date product portfolio. Pre-tax profits should reach
at least Pounds 18.6m this year producing earnings of 32.3p. On that basis
the shares are trading on a relatively modest prospective p/e of 16.6.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wm Baird sees improving trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of William Baird, the textile group, said yesterday that although
some improvement in consumer confidence had been experienced at the end of
the third quarter, trading during the final three months - including the
important Christmas period - had remained difficult.
That was particularly evident in branded ladies' wear where margin
reductions were deemed necessary to clear stocks. Trading at the Berkertex
dress business was particularly poor during December resulting in losses
'exacerbated' by the need for a stock write-off. Management changes had been
made to strengthen the business.
For these reasons the directors expected second half profits at Baird
Textiles, the main subsidiary, to be similar to the Pounds 14.1m returned
for the same period of the previous year. That would include a contribution
from Richard I Racke, the ladies' wear and casual clothing company acquired
in August which resulted in William Baird becoming the third largest
supplier to Marks and Spencer.
For the opening half year to June 30 group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds
10m to Pounds 8.77m with Baird Textiles accounting for Pounds 7.02m (Pounds
8.53m). Analysts were looking for full year profits of about Pounds 22.5m;
that would be lower than last time's Pounds 23.4m but 'well ahead' after
taking account of exceptional adjustments for FRS 3.
Mr Donald Parr, chairman, said the group was now a 'sound clean business'.
He was looking for a much improved overall performance in 1994, pointing out
that the Berkertex bridal business was trading 'extremely well'.
He added that with year-end borrowings expected to be nil, including the
costs of the Racke acquisition, the final dividend for 1993 would be
maintained.
Further disposals within the Darchem business were expected in the near
further, the proceeds of which would be invested in the clothing and
textiles operations.
The shares closed 4p higher on balance at 255p after falling to 225p in
early trading.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Profit warning from Policy Portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Policy Portfolio, the marketmaker in second-hand endowment
policies, fell 10p to 88p yesterday after the company warned that second
half profits were likely to be lower than the first half's Pounds 429,000.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31 1993 totalled Pounds 817,000.
The company joined the market last July, via a placing of 3.6m shares at
130p each, which valued it at Pounds 10.4m.
Directors said yesterday that they expected current year sales to show a
'somewhat disappointing' 30 per cent rise on the previous 12 months, while
gross profit margins would be higher than originally anticipated.
They said the continuing strong performance of share markets in the past
year may have caused some potential investors in traded endowment policies
to focus their activities on other opportunities.
In addition, they said, some participants in the traded endowment market
appeared to be pursuing market share at the expense of profit margins.
The directors had decided not to follow that course of action and,
therefore, those factors had made it difficult to achieve the level of sales
growth they would wish, while maintaining an acceptable profit margin.
During the bonus season there had been a greater than anticipated increase
in value of the company's present stock of policies held for sale.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB considers financial restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, is considering
the possibility of a financial restructuring to repay some of the money
invested by its shareholders.
BSkyB has been investigating with merchant banks the possibility of
organising up to Pounds 500m in non-recourse debt. The talks are, however,
at an early stage and no decisions have yet been taken.
The aim of the financial manoeuvre would be to repay some of the money the
main shareholders - Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Granada, Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, and Chargeurs, the French transport and
communication group - put into the venture.
BSkyB has moved into operating profit and last month made its first Pounds
50m payment to its shareholders with another similar payment expected before
the end of the financial year. The company is still, however, incurring
large pre-tax losses.

Pre-tax losses at Louis Newmark for the half year ended October 2 were cut
from Pounds 888,000 to Pounds 638,000.
With the second half usually the stronger, losses are expected to fall
further.
Turnover for the company, which has interests in the manufacture of
electronic instruments, machining and watch importing, advanced to Pounds
12.2m, against Pounds 10.7m which included Pounds 665,000 from discontinued
activities.
Sales from continuing operations rose 22 per cent with a sharp recovery in
the capital goods businesses.
The company said that the pension fund had moved into deficit and that its
annual provision would have to be increased by Pounds 160,000. This was
reflected pro rata in the interim results.
Losses per share came out at 15.2p (30p).

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Japanese increase helps Unitech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharply higher contribution from its Japanese subsidiary and positive
currency movements helped Unitech, the international electronic components
and controls group, lift interim pre-tax profits by 62 per cent.
Pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds 7.36m in the six months to November 30, up
from Pounds 4.55m, on turnover ahead by 23 per cent to Pounds 144.5m (Pounds
117.2m).
Exchange rate movements benefited pre-tax profits by Pounds 1.2m and added
Pounds 6.1m to turnover.
Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent to 4p (3.4p) and the interim
dividend is up from 2.1p to 2.24p.
The shares closed up 20p at 314p.
Commenting on the results, Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said: 'Notwithstanding
generally low demand and poor trading conditions in many of our markets, we
are experiencing an improving sales trend in most regions.'
Operating profits increased from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 9.76m, boosted by
substantial profit gains in both the power supplies and control products
operations - partly offset by losses in the connectors div-ision.
The power supplies division, which launched a new series of modular supplies
last year, almost doubled its profits to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 3.8m) with
Nemic-Lambda, the 50.6 per cent-owned Japanese subsidiary, contributing
Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 1.5m).
The expanded control products division,also doubled its profit contribution
to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 17.6m).
In contrast, the connectors division 'had a difficult half-year' and
incurred a Pounds 1m loss compared with a Pounds 900,000 profit.
COMMENT
Despite the setback in connectors, Unitech is starting to benefit from
increasing returns on its recent investments in new products, acquisitions
and geographic expansion. With its business split roughly equally between
Europe, North America and east Asia Unitech would be an early beneficiary of
any general world economic upturn. Pre-tax profits this year should reach
Pounds 15.5m generating 9.1p in earnings, but the premium rating - the
shares are currently trading on a prospective p/e of 34.5 - reflects its
valuable holding in a listed Japanese company.

Uncertainties remain about the financial position of Anglesey Mining,
floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1988 to develop Britain's first base
metals mine for decades at Parys Mountain, Anglesey, writes Kenneth Gooding.
Agreements with big creditors expire on March 31 and directors are making
extensive efforts to reach an accommodation, says Mr Hugh Morris, chairman,
in his interim report.
'All those involved have indicated their willingness to negotiate regarding
a deferral of the repayment,' he adds.
The interim report shows that at September 30 Anglesey had Pounds 25,719
cash and amounts due within one year totalled Pounds 67,018. Net current
assets were Pounds 149,774 and shareholders' funds Pounds 8.5m.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: MFI shows advance to Pounds 44.1m - Interim
profits ahead of forecasts and sales improving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI Furniture produced a double surprise yesterday with interim profits
above most City forecasts and the news that sales since Boxing Day were up
14 per cent on last year.
For the 28 weeks to November 6, pre-tax profits were Pounds 44.1m -
including a Pounds 19.6m gain from the sale of MFI's stake in Carpetright -
compared with a loss of Pounds 12m.
Excluding the Carpetright gain, and exceptional flotation costs of Pounds
24.7m last time, pro-forma profits almost doubled from Pounds 12.7m to
Pounds 24.5m.
The shares gained 5p to 179p.
Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said trading in the January sale had been
encouraging - although poor sales last year flattered the comparison - but
he remained cautious.
'Two years ago we had a similar increase which disappeared by the year end,'
he said.
Gross margins fell from 58.5 per cent to 55.6 per cent, though wage costs
fell by Pounds 5m.
Group turnover was up 5.5 per cent, from Pounds 304m to Pounds 320m.
Like-for-like sales, which exclude store openings and closures, were up 7.2
per cent, with virtually no sales inflation.
Two new stores before the year-end - which will trade under the name
Homeworks and be used to test customer reaction to new products and ideas -
will take the chain to 178.
Total sales in MFI's French division were up 30 per cent, with like-for-like
sales up 6 per cent. Three openings should take the French chain to 51
stores by the year-end, with total sales estimated at Pounds 25m.
Borrowings fell from Pounds 82.7m to Pounds 39.7m, and gearing from 78 per
cent to 28 per cent.
Earnings were 5p per share, including the Carpetright gain, and 2.8p
excluding it, from 2.3p last year. The interim dividend is increased from
1.25p to 1.33p.
COMMENT
The good news from MFI provides grounds for optimism. The January sales
increase led to forecasts of an 8 per cent improvement for the second half
as a whole. The group should benefit from signs of a pick-up in the housing
market, while the shift in the sales mix towards kitchens and bedrooms,
which MFI manufactures itself, should help the gross margin. But contrasting
figures from Next, Burton and M&amp;S have highlighted the patchy nature of the
consumer recovery, and MFI admits it has seen false dawns before. A
rejuvenated Magnet could also pose a threat. Full-year forecasts, raised
from about Pounds 60m to about Pounds 72.5m yesterday, put the shares on a
demanding multiple of 22, although that falls to about 18 on forecasts of
Pounds 90m next year.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hopes of solution to Tate &amp; Lyle's Staley
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confronted by American labour leaders at Tate &amp; Lyle's annual meeting in
London yesterday, Mr Neil Shaw, executive chairman, denied that the sugar
and sweeteners' group was anti-union.
'Union busting is not part of our corporate style,' he insisted as he came
under a barrage of critical questioning from the union officials brandishing
proxy votes.
The men had come to London to publicise the eight month lock-out of 760
workers at the Decatur corn-processing plant in Illinois run by the AE
Staley offshoot.
Mr Shaw told shareholders a fresh attempt would be made to break the
deadlock.
'There are some hopeful signs the company will now seriously negotiate with
us but time will tell,' said Mr Mark Brooks, special projects director of
the United Paperworkers' union, after the meeting.
Mr Larry Pillard, chief executive at Staley in Decatur said the company was
ready to reach a deal with the union but 'not on any terms'. A former member
of the Teamster union, he said the company's 'drastic decision' to lock-out
the workers last June was 'not taken in a capricious manner'.
He added that the company had had no alternative when workers began a
work-to-rule against the imposition of new working conditions.
Mr Shaw said that for two years Staley had been attempting to secure a new
employment contract which would involve sweeping changes in working
practices to bring the plant's productivity into line with its US
competitors.
Mr Dave Watts, local president of the United Paperworkers, said yesterday
what the company wanted was 'the worst contract I have seen in the corn
processing industry'.
Despite the edginess of their public exchanges yesterday, which finally
exasperated the mainly elderly shareholders, Mr Shaw and the union leaders
seemed keen to try and find a way out of the dispute.
The board also faced critical questions over last year's resignation by
'mutual consent' of Mr Stephen Brown as chief executive with Pounds 1.1m in
compensation.
On current performance Mr Shaw said that the level of trading was
encouraging with signs of an improvement in continental Europe helped by
currency movements and rising demand.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat in talks with banks on
roll-over terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group discussing a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing
plan with its bankers, is in talks to extend its standstill agreement which
expires on Monday.
It has also appointed two non-executive directors. The group has been
without any non-executives since Mr David Howell and Mr John Gale resigned
last November.
The roll-over of the standstill is unlikely to be opposed by the banks.
However, there is some debate over the length of the extension.
The banks may prefer monthly roll-overs of the standstill, while the company
would like an extension to the end of April, by which time it expects to
have the accounts for 1993 finalised and given to creditors and
shareholders.
Neither group can be expected to vote on restructuring proposals until they
have seen the trading results for 1993 and the year-end balance sheet -
which will incorporate a property revaluation.
The men just appointed - Mr Michael Beckett and Mr Richard Jewson - will sit
on the remuneration and audit committees and attend two board meetings a
month as well as being available when needed. They will each receive an
annual fee of Pounds 27,500, but will not have other incentive arrangements.
Mr Beckett, 57, is known as a troubleshooter and a 'very independent'
non-executive. He was a managing director of Consolidated Goldfields when it
was taken over by Hanson in 1989. He has also been chairman of Ultramar, the
oil group, and a non-executive director of Ranks Hovis McDougall.
At RHM he worked with Stanley Metcalfe, who is now chairman of QMH, although
he is understood to have been short-listed for a directorship before Mr
Metcalfe joined the company. He is also chairman of Horace Clarkson, Watts
Blake Bearne, Monarch Resources and a director of BPB Industries.
Mr Jewson, 49, was chairman and chief executive of Meyer International, the
timber group, until it was decided to split the roles and his chairmanship
ended last month. He is also a non-executive director of Anglian Water and
the Eastern Counties Newspaper group.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Allied Textile makes Pounds 29m N American
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing its policy of overseas expansion, Allied Textile Companies, the
textile manufacturer and processor, yesterday announced two acquisitions in
North America for a combined consideration of about Pounds 29.3m in shares.
The group also revealed a Pounds 1m rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m
for the year to September 30. Shares rose 17p to 568p.
Mr Peter Honeysett, chairman, ascribed the group's ability to consistently
lift its textile profits in a recession to 'anticipating and constantly
rationalising.'
Mr John Corrin, chief executive, added that ATC had bought, sold or shut 24
units in the past 30 months, in response to market or product demand.
Mr Corrin said the rise in textiles profits to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 8.64m)
had been greater than in previous years because of the Pounds 36.5m capital
expenditure since 1990.
The companies acquired are Cleyn &amp; Tinker, a Canadian maker of worsted
cloth, and Carleton Woolen Mills, a US maker of wool and wool blend fabrics.
C&amp;T raised operating profits from CDollars 1.41m to CDollars 3.32m in 1992
and has assets of CDollars 22.4m (Pounds 11.4m). ATC is paying CDollars
33.2m in shares on a p/e of 9.2 for C&amp;T, though this includes CDollars 15m
to cover debt.
Carleton made Dollars 4.33m (Dollars 4.38m) on turnover of Dollars 45.2m
(Dollars 44.8m) in 1992. ATC is paying about Dollars 15.2m (Pounds 10.1m)
via the issue of 2.03m new shares on a p/e of 7.7, plus the issue of up to
411,000 shares to the vendor, which are valued at Pounds 2.27m. Carleton has
Dollars 9m of debt.
The two companies' combined debt, along with ATC's October acquisition of
Coatings Applications (Textiles) for about Pounds 6m, has all but wiped out
the group's cash pile, which at the interim stage stood at Pounds 27m.
The consideration shares are to be placed at 500p on a 1-for-5.3265 basis.
Group turnover for the year slipped to Pounds 127.4m (Pounds 129.1m);
earnings grew to 33.2p (30.8p) per share; and the final dividend is lifted
to 8.3p for a total of 12.9p (12.6p).
COMMENT
It is almost impossible to find a critic of the transatlantic acquisitions.
Having stalked C&amp;T for three years (and put continental European expansion
on hold pending the recession), ATC has clearly done its homework. It waited
for the successful conclusion of Nafta and then Gatt - the 36 per cent
tariff barrier is set to reduce by 1 point a year - it has paid a good price
and is still not geared and there should be no problems getting the paper
away. Furthermore, the group's canny reputation has been enhanced by its
growing openness. Forecasts for the current year range from Pounds 16.5m to
Pounds 18m pre-tax for earnings of 35p to 38.7p. giving a p/e of about 15, a
discount to the market.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sir Denys Henderson to join Rank board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rank Organisation yesterday ended more than a year of speculation by naming
Sir Denys Henderson, head of ICI, as the leisure group's nominee chairman.
Sir Denys, who retires as ICI chairman in April next year, will become a
non-executive director of Rank in March. After retiring from ICI, where he
masterminded the demerger of the drugs group Zeneca, he will be appointed
non-executive chairman of Rank. He will work part-time at the company's
headquarters.
Sir Denys said yesterday he was delighted at the appointment. 'I hope my
experience in various different fields of business will enable me to
contribute to the company's continuing success,' he said.
He replaces Sir Leslie Fletcher, who took over as temporary chairman
following the death of Sir Patrick Meany in 1992. Sir Denys and Sir Patrick
were close personal friends for many years, and the latter was once a
director on the ICI board.
That friendship is likely to stand Sir Denys in good stead in his new post,
where he will work closely with Mr Michael Gifford, Rank's blunt speaking
chief executive. Both were named in a survey of Britain's toughest bosses.
Mr Gifford said he, too, was delighted at the appointment. Rank is believed
to have been discussing Sir Denys's nomination for several months.
Sir Denys is also a director of RTZ and Barclays. Rank is carrying debt of
almost Pounds 1bn, the legacy of the Pounds 889m Mecca takeover. It has
already announced annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 230m to Pounds
276.6m.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Partco set to float in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partco, the biggest inde-pendent distributor of automotive parts and
equipment in the UK, is to be floated in March with an estimated market
value of Pounds 50m.
The company is raising Pounds 25m in a placing and intermediaries' offer in
the second flotation recently announced in a rapidly consolidating sector.
Finelist, a smaller competitor, will be floated next month with a
capitalisation of about Pounds 25m.
Partco distributes car and commercial vehicle components, automotive paint
and refinishing materials, and equipment for vehicle workshops. It expects
to report a doubling of pre-tax profits to about Pounds 4.3m for the year to
December 31 on sales of Pounds 124m.
It delivers branded and own-label products to business customers from a
210-branch network which stretches from Cornwall to north-east Scotland.
Of those, 99 branches offer paints and bodyshop refinishing products, as
well as other parts. The group has a central distribution warehouse in
Northamptonshire.
Mr Peter Redfern, managing director, sees ample scope for expansion, both by
acquisition and opening greenfield operations.
The group has only one branch in a city as big as Manchester and has
identified 200 areas where it is not represented, yet have catchment
populations of 25,000.
Partco was the product of a management buy-out from Quinton Hazell in 1986.
The team turned round the lossmaking business and in 1989 became the biggest
independent distributor through the purchase of GKN Autoparts in 1989.
The deal was completed just before the UK went into recession. By 1991 the
group needed to swap equity for debt and close lossmaking outlets. Mr
Redfern said this explained why the flotation 'would not create any paper
millionaires', although the executive team would end up with about 5 per
cent of the enlarged equity between them.
Mr Gordon Yardley, a non-executive director of BTR, was appointed chairman
of Partco in 1991.
The group is being advised by Hambro Magan, with Cazenove acting as brokers
to the issue.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: 20% pay rise for Carlton chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, was paid more than
Pounds 630,000 last year, an increase of just under 20 per cent.
Mr Green, who is in the process of becoming one of the most powerful people
in UK television following Carlton's agreed takeover of Central, received
only a 3.5 per cent increase on his basic salary.
The overall package included a bonus of Pounds 207,000 linked to the
company's earnings per share record. This compared with a bonus of only
Pounds 120,000 last time.
The Carlton chairman and joint founder earned twice as much as the next
highest paid directors. Three directors, presumably including Ms June de
Moller, group managing director, and Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of
Carlton Television, earned between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 315,000 in
1993.
In the annual report, published yesterday, Mr Green wrote of a significant
year for the company, with turnover increasing to Pounds 1.09bn and pre-tax
profits to Pounds 126.1m. He emphasised that together Carlton and Central
make up the largest part of the ITV network with 30 per cent of ITV
advertising revenue and broadcasting to 36 per cent of the UK population.

Warner Estate Holdings, the property investment company, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m for the year to September 1993, up from a
restated Pounds 4.12m in 1992.
Turnover fell to Pounds 11m (Pounds 12.2m) as a result of a decline in
property trading activity. A final dividend of 7.35p makes an 11p (10.5p)
total.
Earnings also amounted to 11p and net asset value was Pounds 129.2m at the
year end, or 266p (247p) a share.
The company has subsequently raised Pounds 5m from the sale of the Catford
Centre, and invested Pounds 17.4m in a mixed commercial property portfolio.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Reinsurers eager for drama to become crisis: The popularity
of catastrophe reinsurance means rates may fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After floods in Europe, fires in Australia and a freeze in the eastern US,
last week's Los Angeles earthquake has again reminded reinsurers of the
scale of the risks to which they are exposed. Yet although the final bill is
not yet known, early indications show that the markets have remained
relatively unscathed.
Overall economic losses from the earthquake are provisionally estimated at
more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), at least double the toll of the San
Francisco earthquake in 1989. But with much of the damage uninsured, claims
are expected to amount to no more than Dollars 3bn.
Also, because two of the biggest US insurers in California - Allstate and
State Farm - buy very little reinsurance, analysts expect reinsurers to pay
at most only Dollars 1.5bn of that bill.
Casual observers would expect reinsurers, especially those exposed to high
level catastrophe losses, to be relieved. After all the string of
catastrophe losses, which shook the world between 1989 and 1990, has caused
considerable grief to reinsurers, especially at Lloyd's, where the impact
has ruined hundreds of Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the market - and been one of the main factors in the
market's recent problems.
Yet in London, at least, some reinsurers wish that the loss could have been
bigger. 'Not big enough, old boy. We needed 8 1/2 ' on the Richter scale
which measures earthquake intensity, was one typical comment last week.
Indeed many on the market suspect that rates are likely to fall later this
year.
Underpinning this ostensibly perverse rationale is a simple calculation. The
catastrophes sandwiched between the European storms of 1987 and hurricane
Andrew of 1992 caused losses of more than Dollars 40bn, drove many smaller
players out of the market and - as the mechanics of supply and demand for
reinsurance shifted in favour of the seller - led to sizeable increases in
reinsurance rates.
Lloyd's of London said last year that catastrophe reinsurance rates had
risen by between 133 per cent (for US companies), 450 per cent (for UK
companies) and 780 per cent (for Japanese companies) since 1990. In
addition, insurers buying reinsurance covers have generally accepted much
more risk on their own accounts, with 'deductibles', or excess points,
rising by between 75 per cent in the UK and 500 per cent in Japan.
This movement has transformed the underlying profitability of catastrophe
reinsurance and attracted billions of dollars back into the business. Last
year institutional investors pumped more than Dollars 4bn into new
reinsurance ventures, based mainly in the lightly and flexibly regulated
Bermudian market.
More than Pounds 800m in institutional funds have been injected into
Lloyd's, where Names strong enough to continue trading have also increased
their commitments. Capacity at Lloyd's - the amount of premium which Lloyd's
syndicates are allowed to underwrite - will increase to at least Pounds
10.5bn in 1994, compared with Pounds 8.7bn in 1993.
As a result capacity shortages in the catastrophe reinsurance market have
substantially eased. For buyers the recent renewal season - most US and UK
insurers renegotiate their catastrophe reinsurance protections towards the
end of each year - was the easiest for some time. Many brokers completed
deals much earlier than in either 1992 or 1993.
With more capital chasing better risks and creating what one Lloyd's
underwriter describes as a 'feeding frenzy', reinsurers have found it
difficult to underwrite as much business as they want. 'Last year you would
have got 10 per cent of a risk. This year you will be lucky to get 6 per
cent,' said the underwriter, who specialises in US business (most business
in London is underwritten on a subscription basis with several underwriters
writing an agreed percentage of a policy).
So far rates have been firm. Indeed, according to Mr Charles Bray,
reinsurance broker with Willis Corroon, many larger US insurers paid
increases of about 15 per cent this year - although smaller companies buying
lesser amounts of cover were able to renew at existing rates. 'There is a
lot of posturing at the moment. A lot of buyers would like to see reductions
in their prices but no one is giving them,' said Mr Bray.
However, brokers and underwriters are expecting rates to come under pressure
later this year. Japanese and Australian insurers renew their catastrophe
programmes in mid-year and could be the first to benefit.
'I think rates will drop by July. The Japanese book will come under
tremendous pressure,' says another Lloyd's underwriter, who expects cuts of
up to 15 per cent.
Mr Charles Kline, of Centre Cat, one of the new catastrophe reinsurance
companies formed in Bermuda, also expects prices to fall. 'Prices will go
down, probably dramatically in some cases. But whether they go down by that
crucial amount which makes the business untenable, that is really an
unanswered question. Much will depend on underwriters' discipline.'
Increasingly analysts believe that only a very large loss will stymie these
inexorable pressures. Hence the cynicism in London about Los Angeles.
According to one specialist reinsurance broker: 'We may have seen the peak
of catastrophe pricing unless the world starts blowing, shaking and burning
again.'

The patchy and volatile nature of the recovery in consumer spending was
highlighted yesterday by disappointing sales figures from fashion group
Burton and a lacklustre statement from clothing and food retailer Marks and
Spencer.
The statements contrasted sharply with Wednesday's news from fashion
retailer Next that sales in the half-year to January 31 were expected to be
18 per cent up, and yesterday's announcement from MFI, the furniture group,
that sales since Boxing Day were up 14 per cent. MFI also unveiled a
near-doubling of pro-forma interim profits to Pounds 24.5m.
The figures sent analysts scurrying to rewrite their full-year profits
forecasts, with Burton downgraded from about Pounds 60m to between Pounds
40m and Pounds 45m, and MFI lifted from about Pounds 60m to about Pounds
70m. M&amp;S was unchanged at Pounds 860m-Pounds 880m.
Sir John Hoskyns, Burton's chairman, told the company's annual meeting that
sales for the first 21 weeks of the financial year, to January 22, were no
better than last year.
Sales were 5 per cent up at Debenhams, but down 5 per cent in the multiple
chains - which include names such as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and
Principles - reflecting tough competition and increased promotional activity
in clothing. Sir John said the multiples were responding to strategic
changes, 'but change of this kind, which was urgently necessary, is also
painful'.
Lower mark-ups to make prices more competitive, plus markdowns to clear
stock, resulted in a reduction in Burton's gross margin of 1.5 percentage
points, although costs in the period had been reduced by 2 per cent.
M&amp;S said that after a disappointing November, sales had recovered to the
extent that the six weeks to January 1 had met expectations. But it operated
at full price throughout Christmas, and the margin loss in the
post-Christmas sale, in money terms, was the same as last year. With
increased sales, that suggests the overall gross margin for the period will
be higher.
Yesterday's figures added to the mixed picture of Christmas and new year
trading, with disappointing results from Dixons and Kingfisher, solid
performances from the likes of M&amp;S, Sears, Boots and WH Smith, and sharper
improvements from Signet, Laura Ashley, Storehouse, and Next.
'The upturn in spending is far from smooth,' said Mr Tim Kirkwood, analyst
at Panmure Gordon. He said the vast difference in profit expectations
between 'recovery' stocks such as Next and Burton reflected not just
internal factors, but the weakness of the consumer recovery. If recovery was
stronger, he suggested, most retailers would be seeing the benefits.

FT  28 JAN 94 / TV bidders look to relaxed rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV companies involved in takeovers believe the Office of Fair Trading is
moving towards allowing one company to control up to 25 per cent of all UK
television advertising.
This would relax much narrower existing limits, set at 25 per cent of ITV
revenue. If the market were redefined as all television advertising  -
including Channel 4, cable and satellite - only a modest reorganisation of
the advertising sales house system would be needed.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, last week said it
should be possible to avoid referring the Granada-LWT and Carlton-Central
takeover bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The condition,
however, was that competition concerns over too great a concentration of
power among advertising sales houses should be resolved.
A Granada takeover of LWT would mean the combined sales houses would account
for 40 per cent of ITV revenue.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said yesterday, during a
renewed attack on LWT, that he did not expect advertising reorganisation
costs to be significant.
He was speaking as Granada sent another missive to LWT shareholders urging
them to accept the hostile offer of six Granada shares for every five LWT,
worth roughly Pounds 725m, with a 528p a share cash alternative. The offer
was yesterday extended until February 9, but not improved.
Yesterday's attack featured '10 Facts LWT Would Rather You Didn't Know',
such as claims that Granada Television's performance was better than LWT's
on everything from programme sales to cash generation.
Mr Robinson also raised questions about LWT's profit estimates of Pounds
43.8m for the year. 'We will not be using these numbers in our internal
calculations.'
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), commented that the
estimates had been reviewed by an audit committee of non-executive directors
and were 'rock solid'.
Meanwhile it emerged that Granada plans, if it wins, to go below the
existing senior management - many of them multi-millionaires - and rely on
promoting young middle managers.

FT  28 JAN 94 / IBM UK sees return to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM UK, hardest hit of the computer manufacturer's national subsidiaries in
1992, staged a strong recovery last year cutting losses substantially.
The company lost Pounds 174m before tax, including Pounds 55m of
restructuring charges, compared with Pounds 767m losses after Pounds 369m
charges in 1992.
Mr Nick Temple, chief executive, attributed the improvement to cost cutting
and a sharper business focus. He expected a return to profit this year. The
parent company had made an equity investment of Pounds 350m last year to
strengthen the balance sheet, leaving the debt-equity ratio at 100 per cent.
The company did better than the rest of IBM's European operations, most of
which are showing declining sales and profitability as the recession deepens
on the continent. European operations showed a 1 per cent decline in
revenues overall.
IBM UK's turnover rose to Pounds 4.06bn, up 8 per cent on the Pounds 3.75bn
recorded in 1992 and in line with average industry growth. The parent
company, reporting its 1993 results earlier this week, posted an Dollars
8.1bn loss after restructuring charges on revenues 2.8 per cent down at
Dollars 62.7bn.
IBM UK's revenues are split between home sales, which totalled Pounds
1.73bn, and exports which came to Pounds 2.3bn.
Mr Temple said the company had redesigned many of the ways it did business.
Staff numbers had been cut by more than 30 per cent since 1990 and now stood
at about 11,400. A 'few hundred' more jobs would go this year as
restructuring continued.
Mr Temple said that mainframe computers sales were 'stable' in the UK but
there had been growth in services, mid-range systems and personal computers.
The company's factory at Greenock, Scotland, which makes PCs for Europe, was
working at full capacity, with 80 per cent of its output exported.
IBM Germany's revenues declined to DM12.6bn (Pounds 4.8bn) from DM13.8bn.
The company said operating profits improved, but it made a loss because of
restructuring charges.
IBM Netherlands' total revenue declined 12 per cent to Fl 2.98bn (Pounds
1bn). Profits after tax slid 35 per cent to Fl 127m.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Euro Disney drawing on cash earmarked by parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the struggling leisure group, is understood to have run out of
money and to be dependent on the financial support of Walt Disney, its US
parent.
Walt Disney made a provision of Dollars 350m (Pounds 233.3m) in its figures
for the fourth quarter of the year to September 30, partly to cover its
exposure to Euro Disney. It has earmarked Dollars 175m to meet the cost of
providing limited financial support to the European group during the current
quarter.
Euro Disney, which is trying to negotiate an emergency financial rescue
package with its creditor banks, warned last autumn that it could face a
serious cashflow crisis early in 1994.
Neither it nor Walt Disney would comment on the financial position. But Euro
Disney is understood to have exhausted its cash.
The US group, which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, has promised to provide
enough money to meet its working capital and short-term investment
requirements until March 31, giving it enough time to complete negotiations
with the banks.
However, Walt Disney has warned the banks that it will only support Euro
Disney until the March deadline. If the two sides have not agreed terms for
a financial restructuring by then, Walt Disney has said it will withdraw
support. Euro Disney would then almost certainly go into receivership and
the lavish EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris would close.
Meanwhile the Euro Disney banks are preparing for a special meeting in Paris
next Wednesday at which they will discuss the findings of an investigative
audit commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
KPMG was asked by the banks to assess the present financial condition and
future requirements of Euro Disney and to evaluate its corporate strategy.
Walt Disney has already asked the banks to consider a series of
restructuring proposals that include halving Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Pounds
2.28bn) debt through the combination of a FFr5bn rights issue and a
debt-for-equity swap. The banks are expected to demand concessions from Walt
Disney such as waiving royalty fees on Euro Disney merchandise and ticket
sales. It might also be asked to pump capital into Euro Disney by buying
assets, notably the EuroDisneyland hotels.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Ofgas eases price setting factor: Domestic gas bills will
fall more slowly to offset industrial losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, yesterday relaxed the main element in the
tariff formula which sets the price British Gas can charge to its monopoly
market of about 18m residential customers.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, accepted a recommendation by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the efficiency factor in the
formula, set in 1992 at the retail price index minus 5 percentage points, be
relaxed to RPI minus 4. The factor makes up 60 per cent of a consumer's
bill, with the actual cost of the gas accounting for the remainder.
The reduction is intended to compensate British Gas for the large loss of
commercial and industrial customers to independent gas suppliers in the past
two years, and the negative impact that has had on investment.
Mr Norman Blacker, managing director of UK Gas Business, the domestic supply
arm of British Gas, welcomed the decision, saying it would 'help redress
some of the loss of income caused by . . . the introduction of competition
into the market above 2,500 therms'.
The financial benefit to British Gas is likely to be worth about Pounds 24m
after-tax this year, according to City analysts. British Gas shares closed
up 4 1/2 p at 349 1/2 p.
Ofgas said the change would have little impact on consumers, who would
simply see a slower rate of decline in gas prices.
The regulator estimated gas prices would fall 1.8 per cent less over three
years than under the RPI minus 5 formula. That would be equivalent to about
Pounds 2 a year for the average household, it said.
But the Gas Consumers Council said prices would fall by 3 per cent less over
three years. Mr Ian Powe, director, said some would see this concession as a
watchdog eating from the hand it used to bite.
Many analysts saw the decision as further evidence of a rapidly improving
relationship between Ofgas and British Gas. Relations between the two were
often turbulent under Sir James McKinnon, former director-general, who
stepped down last November.
Earlier this week, Ms Spottiswoode admitted that Ofgas had at times
'exceeded its powers' in dealing with British Gas.
But the regulator remained adamant that it would not implement another MMC
recommendation that consumers pay for the break-up of British Gas. The
government last month rejected that course in favour of the complete
separation of the storage and transportation business from British Gas's
trading arm.
Ofgas said that since divestment was no longer an issue, 'there is no reason
why the costs of internal restructuring should be borne by customers'.

</HEADLINE>

ICI shares have under-performed the market by just over 30 per cent since
Sir Denys Henderson became chairman in April 1987. Perhaps he will do better
by the Rank Organisation which has almost level-pegged the index in the same
period, despite what many see as the misguided purchase of Mecca. A first
step could be to sell the group's minority stake in Rank Xerox back to its
parent. But that is not a new idea and there are tax obstacles aplenty in
the way, not to mention the question of whether Xerox can afford the deal.
The bigger strategic test will be to make sense of Rank's hotchpotch of
managed businesses, ranging from video-duplication to holiday camps.

After the raging storm that was Sir James McKinnon, Ms Clare Spottiswoode's
still, small voice of calm comes as quite a shock. The new gas watchdog has
agreed with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas's price
cap should be loosened a notch. Given that Ms Spottiswoode would have been
exposed to judicial review had she overturned a conclusion which the MMC
took a year to reach, it should be no surprise.
Still, such sweet reason must come as a relief to British Gas. Equally, the
abolition of the price cap in the newly-competitive market will help the
company fight cherry picking. Yet while the fillip is useful, it hardly
transforms Gas's prospects. Pressure will remain on the domestic gas
business. And the shares' 5.2 per cent yield reflects the risk that the
company may struggle to sustain dividend increases above the rate of
inflation.

FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer has again been hoist by its own reticence. Yesterday's
two-paragraph trading statement came earlier than the stock market expected
but was typically terse. Without hard figures to go on, investors chose to
assume the worst. That could be a mistake. Careful reading suggests that
decent trading over Christmas at least made up for a poor November. If the
cash cost of the post-Christmas sale was similar to last year, and volumes
have gone up, gross margin should actually have improved.
After yesterday's 3.5 per cent fall, though, the shares stand at their
lowest rating relative to the market for some years. In part, that reflects
the de-rating of the sector as retailers have lost the benefits of inflation
and high street property has lost its attractions. Nor are M&amp;S's defensive
qualities the height of fashion while recovery stocks are available
elsewhere. That said, the margin erosion revealed by Burton yesterday is a
reminder that not all retailing recovery stories will have the anticipated
happy ending. If budget tax increases take the edge off consumer spending
through the summer, M&amp;S's unbroken record of earnings growth will start to
count for more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The newly independent Bank of France scores high marks for presentation.
Choosing a 1994 money supply target close to the 4 to 6 per cent range
established by the Bundesbank would have seemed barmy after last year's
massive undershoot and the prospect of slow expansion again this year.
Establishing a medium-term target around what is coincidentally the central
point of the Bundesbank's present range keeps intact the theory of
convergence. That is in itself an indication that the Bank of France does
not intend to stray far from the Bundesbank on interest rates.
The trouble with medium-term targets is that, while they prevent policy
being unnecessarily influenced by short-term distortions, they also give the
authorities the effective freedom to make decisions on the hoof. Since the
shift of funds out of money market deposits will again make comparison of
this year's M3 growth with the target meaningless, the Bank has to rely on
other signals.
One indicator which it is emphasising, the exchange rate, again underscores
an attachment to Germany. The other, growth of total indebtedness in the
economy, will provide an additional excuse for caution in cutting interest
rates. That will not help exporters who are struggling to compete in
European markets where currencies have been devalued. Nor will it create a
propitious climate for the remaining privatisation programme.

FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada's media hype
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stopping the clock in takeover bids may drag the process out, but at least
it allows more time for knockabout exchanges. Yesterday's missive from
Granada was good value in that respect. There were some eye-popping numbers:
Granada's bid values LWT at a Japanese-style 35 times its annual cash flow,
and rates it at a 42 per cent premium to the FT-SE-A All-Share index, itself
scarcely undervalued. There was also some entertaining rhetoric which,
incidentally, reinforced the point that much of the re-rating of media
companies has already happened. Indeed, shareholders may be beginning to
wonder whether Granada's offer more than reflects the sector's prospects.
It may be that Granada has little option but to participate in the current
consolidation if it wishes to remain a large shark in the shrinking ITV
pool. But that does not guarantee good long-term returns for shareholders.
The debate over advertising sales has shown that ITV companies are currently
little more than a moderately predictable cash flow over the next nine years
with a reasonable certainty of renewal for a further decade. On that basis,
the current bids look expensive. Unless the new larger companies can use
their channel 3 licences as a platform for wider ambitions, the bids may
come back to haunt chairmen in future annual general meetings.
Stretched valuations are not the only nail in LWT's coffin. Granada is
likely to be able to meet any Office of Fair Trading objections on
advertising sales. LWT's prospects of finding a white knight able to match
Granada's offer seem to be evaporating. That leaves LWT with a very
difficult proposition to sell. Given that Granada is in such a strong
position, it was thus a touch disappointing that in the pursuit of good
sport the predator found it necessary to cast innuendo on LWT's profits
forecast.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Directors of Independent to consider rival bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the future of The Independent gets under way in earnest today
as directors meet to consider two rival bids.
Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group of Ireland yesterday
formally proposed investing up to Pounds 32m in Newspaper Publishing, the
company that owns The Independent and The Independent on Sunday.
Under the proposed deal, the Irish group would provide Pounds 21m in new
money for the loss-making British newspaper group in the form of convertible
loan stock. This stock would convert into ordinary shares in Newspaper
Publishing at Pounds 3 a share which would give Mr O'Reilly's company a
maximum of 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing.
In addition, the Irish group would make a separate offer for up to 20 per
cent of the existing shares at Pounds 2.50 a share.
An offer was also submitted yesterday from the consortium put together by
the two main existing shareholders, the continental European newspaper
groups El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica.
The consortium includes Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Andreas Whittam
Smith, the main founder of The Independent. It proposes to buy out the 52
per cent of Newspaper Publishing it does not already own. El Pais and La
Repubblica would hold 50.2 per cent, MGN 40 per cent, and the founders the
rest. The offer was in the range of Pounds 2.40 and Pounds 2.80 a share.
To make any headway, the Irish proposal will need the support of at least
some of the members of the consortium.
The Daily Telegraph reported today that its publisher, The Telegraph, was
still interested in The Independent. Mr Dan Colson, Telegraph vice-chairman,
said the Newspaper Publishing board was 'aware of our proposal'.

FT  28 JAN 94 / France and US in clash over ways to end Bosnian civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western disagreements over how to end the Bosnian civil war yesterday
erupted into angry recriminations between Paris and Washington as Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, flatly denied French assertions that
the US had washed its hands of the crisis.
He was responding to comments yesterday by Mr Richard Duque, the French
foreign ministry spokesman. Hitting back at earlier remarks by his State
Department counterpart, Mr Mike McCurry, that France was resorting to 'a
very strange moral calculus' in insisting that the US exert full pressure on
the Bosnian Moslems, Mr Duque retorted: 'If we are talking on a moral level,
the choice today is between merely watching the fighting and doing
everything possible to stop it.'
Mr Christopher insisted: 'The US is not standing by, by any means.' He
repeated the US support of Nato resolutions which could lead to the use of
air power in support of United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian
operations, specifically to reopen the airport at Tuzla and to relieve
Canadian troops besieged in Srebrenica.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday received a report
from Mr Yasushi Akashi, his special representative in former Yugoslavia,
detailing UN military plans, including the possible use of air power, to
secure these two goals.
Mr Christopher said: 'We're quite prepared to pursue the president's
commitment to take action when UN military plans are drawn up,' adding that
both President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister,
'were supportive on these points'.
He also rebuffed what were seen in Washington as French demands that the US
send troops to Bosnia. 'The US does not believe it should put in ground
forces in order to require the parties to enter into a settlement. We think
it would be inappropriate to insist that the victim, the Bosnian government,
conform to some pre-existing plan,' he said.
In Paris, however, Mr Duque said France had never proposed imposing a
settlement by force or a massive military intervention.
Despite yesterday's exchanges, the French government made clear it intends
to continue trying to convince the US of the merits of a more concerted
diplomatic support for the European Union's peace plan for Bosnia.

FT  28 JAN 94 / MMC opposes public competition inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moves to inject greater transparency into the workings of the UK competition
authorities by holding inquiries in public are being blocked by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
A review last year of the commission's internal procedures carried out for
the Department of Trade and Industry by accountants Price Waterhouse has
called for greater transparency in commission procedures.
But Mr Graeme Odgers, MMC chairman, said yesterday the need for the
commission to have access to highly sensitive commercial information meant
inquiries should continue to be held in private.
Presenting the commission's first annual review since taking over from Sir
Sydney Lipworth last April, Mr Odgers said open inquiries would make
companies under investigation more cautious and would result in longer, more
formal proceedings.
That would increase the period of uncertainty faced by businesses caught up
in an investigation at a time when the government was trying to reduce the
burden on industry of complying with competition law.
The Consumers' Association said that while some parts of the inquiry process
should continue to be held in private to deal with confidential information
there was a strong case for exposing the commission's broader findings to
wider public scrutiny.
Mr Stephen Locke, the association's director of policy, said the MMC's
stance was in marked contrast to that of the Office of Fair Trading.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The refusenicks at GCHQ - the UK government's intelligence monitoring
station at Cheltenham, where trade unions were banned 10 years ago - were
startled to hear Rupert Allason, Conservative MP for Torbay, explain in a
parliamentary debate why the union ban was imposed.
Allason blamed it on lack of cover in December 1981. When martial law was
imposed by General Wojciech Jaruzelski across Poland, the UK was 'blind' in
intelligence terms, according to Allason. But John Cook, one of 14 trade
unionists who lost their jobs for refusing to accept the ban, thinks
Allason, who doubles as the thriller writer Nigel West, has been listening
to too many spy stories. Cook believes there was no industrial action at
GCHQ at the time.
He has a point. A colleague was working in Warsaw then, and during martial
law was asked by the British embassy's defence attache to observe 'casually'
Polish military movements - a remarkable scraping of the barrel in spying
terms.

The Labour party's seven-week-old procedural war against Britain's Tory
government at Westminster is turning ugly. Labour's refusal to 'pair' with
Tory MPs, the process whereby MPs of opposing parties agree to be absent
during a vote, is forcing MPs to be on hand for virtually every Commons vote
 -a stricture to which most are unaccustomed. As if this was not bad enough,
one of the high spots in the MP's winter calendar - a fact-finding trip by
the defence select committee, to the former British colony of Belize - has
had to be cancelled. A case of the wrong type of guerrilla warfare?

FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Henderson's new leisure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So Sir Denys Henderson, 11th and last chairman of the old Imperial Chemical
Industries, has a new job to while away his retirement in April next year.
The chairmanship of the Rank Organisation is not, perhaps, the most obvious
choice. On the one hand, Rank is the classic purveyor of entertainment for
the masses: Butlins, bingo, Odeon cinemas and fruit machines. ICI's only
real point of contact with the consumer is Dulux paint.
On the other, Rank as a whole is an ungainly sprawl. Besides hotels, casinos
and the rest of its leisure empire, it takes in a half share of Rank Xerox
and some Pounds 600m of specialised sales to the film and TV industries. It
was Sir Denys who decided ICI - a tightly focused business by Rank's stand-
ards - was too diffuse, and last year broke it into two companies. What will
he make of Rank? And, as a pugnacious Aberdonian, what will he make of
Michael Gifford, Rank's equally pugnacious Australian chief executive?
The appointment raises a broader question. ICI is a tightly knit culture,
and Sir Denys is typical in having spent his entire working life with the
company. His immediate predecessor, Sir John Harvey-Jones, is a mixed
advertisement for the effectiveness of ICI Man in the wider world. On the
one hand, Sir John on his retirement lectured the nation on how to run
things. On the other, his own choice of directorships proved patchy, taking
in as it did the now bust recruitment group Burns Anderson and the
struggling aircraft leasing giant GPA.
But ICI has quite a prominent record in providing bosses for the nation. It
is 30 years since Lord Beeching - an ICI director - took the axe to the
railways.
The present chairmen of Lloyds Bank, BICC and British Airports Authority are
all ex-ICI directors. Previous ICI chairmen went on to run Dunlop, Blue
Circle and British Home Stores. In their time, other ex-ICI directors have
run British Steel, British Coal, Rolls-Royce and Tate &amp; Lyle.
Not all these companies have prospered: but that, of course, is another
story.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monopolies thrive on secrecy. One of the best ways of combating them is to
expose them to the full glare of public scrutiny. In the US, they call this
'sunshine regulation'. But most competition authorities do not practise
sunshine regulation. They prefer to conduct their investigations behind
closed doors.
Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission is perhaps not the main culprit.
Its independence from government and its habit of publishing detailed
reports setting out the conclusions of its inquiries certainly compare
favourably with the European Commission.
The drawbacks of the European Union's approach were amply demonstrated
earlier this week when the full Commission failed to back a proposal by Mr
Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, to block a three-way steel
tube merger on grounds that it was anti-competitive. Not for the first time,
political considerations overruled consumers' interests. The case for an
independent European cartel office now seems unanswerable.
But independence alone does not guarantee openness. For example, it has not
prevented the Commission from being a black box. Until an investigation is
completed and recommendations published, the Commission operates a system of
strict purdah. This allows a monopolist to put a spin on the facts while
other interested parties, which might be able to rebut its position, are
kept in the dark.
Mr Graeme Odgers, the MMC chairman, yesterday acknowledged the importance of
regulatory openness. That is also one of the conclusions of an unpublished
review of the Commission by Department of Trade and Industry consultants.
But, beyond releasing a new video, which explains the MMC's workings by
taking viewers through a mock investigation, Mr Odgers had little to offer
by way of remedy. In particular, he rejected the idea of holding open
hearings or publishing the Commission's preliminary findings.
This is a pity. A video of a mock investigation is no substitute for public
hearings. Nor is the publication of a detailed final report any substitute
for public access to the Commission's preliminary findings. Once the final
report is published, it is too late for the views of interested parties to
have any effect.
Mr Odgers defended the Commission's behind-closed-doors approach on the
grounds that much of the information revealed in its investigations is
commercially confidential. Confidentiality is certainly an issue. But it is
not clear why it cannot be protected by holding selected hearings in private
instead of having a blanket in camera approach.
Nor is Mr Odgers' argument that public hearings would encourage participants
to play to the gallery compelling. It assumes that the public cannot form a
view of what is in its interest. The Commission's motto should be less black
box and more sunshine.

FT  28 JAN 94 / No work, little to believe in: Popular pressure for
politicians to find solutions to east German unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Eva Maria Geer no longer believes the politicians in Bonn. 'Why should
I? They made all these promises about rapid prosperity in east Germany,' she
said, holding her youngest daughter. 'From my experience, when people talk
about becoming competitive, it means cutting jobs. That makes it all the
more depressing for my chances of re-entering the labour market.'
Like many of her friends, Mrs Geer used to work in the local shipyards in
the east German city of Rostock. Before reunification in 1989, the yards
employed more than 25,000 people. Today, fewer than 5,000 work at the docks.
In 1991, Mrs Geer became pregnant. Her husband fell ill. At the end of her
maternity leave, she received a letter stating her job was no longer
available.
Mrs Geer dismissed the 30-point economic plan unveiled by the government
last week as rhetoric. Aimed at increasing workplace flexibility and
improving competitiveness, it is regarded by many of east Germany's
unemployed as irrelevant. The plan includes help for start-up companies in
the form of low-interest loans, encouragement for the long-term unemployed
to take low-paid work and the promotion of part-time employment in the state
and private sectors.
But such proposals only induce scepticism among voters. As the campaigning
gets under way for a marathon round of local and state elections in March,
the plight of east Germany's 1.17m unemployed and the cost to the west
German taxpayer are starting to dominate the political debate.
Candidates are finding it an uphill struggle to convince east Germans that
the labour market will improve, even though their economy is forecast to
grow by about 6 per cent this year.
Apart from the official unemployment statistics there is an additional
problem: nearly 2m east Germans are classified as working but are either on
short-time, retraining, or job-creation schemes. The combined cost to the
government of east German unemployment benefits, plus funding for the
schemes, was more than DM45bn (Pounds 17.1bn) last year.
Unemployment in east Germany has been exacerbated by several factors. First
among them is the unrealistic wage agreement between IG Metall, the
engineering union, and west German employers to equalise eastern and western
wages by 1996, despite eastern productivity rates running at about 50 per
cent of those in the west. Second, the rush towards privatisation has meant
the closure of many enterprises in east Germany.
Mr Rainer Schondube, a board member of Germanischer Lloyd, the Hamburg-based
shipping insurance company which took over its east German counterpart in
1990, said: 'Wage levels are the main contributing factor to unemployment.'
But Mr Schondube believes it would have been more socially acceptable for
the government to subsidise unnecessary jobs temporarily than to support
large numbers of unemployed in east Germany.
'We have heard all the arguments about over-employment in the east German
enterprises, which is true. But for political stability and for the morale
of the people, it would have been better to finance jobs rather than
unemployment,' he said.
Amid the disillusionment at broken promises about how reunification would
improve living standards in east Germany - and, in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
memorable words, lead to 'a blossoming landscape' - there is no shortage of
east Germans willing to go to extremes to find work.
Mr Werner Rosler is one of 360,000 commuters who work in west Germany. For
the past two years, he has each Sunday evening made the two-and-a-half-hour
train journey from Rostock to Hamburg. During the week, he works at
Germanischer Lloyd, a tall building overlooking the docks.
'I'm one of the lucky ones, especially at my age. I am 51. I have had the
chance to retrain and have a permanent job. Of course, I would prefer to
spend time with my family in Rostock. But I have to make compromises,' he
said.
Across Hamburg, in the north-east of the city, is Otto Versand, the giant
mail-order business which last year had a consolidated turnover of DM21.2bn
and employs 44,000 worldwide. Otto Versand continues to expand. Despite
Hamburg's unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent, the management cannot find
local staff for the packaging department.
'They are too qualified, or else they do not want to do this kind of work,'
explained Mr Detlev Livonius, head of public relations.
Instead, the company employs more than 500 commuters from the north-eastern
state of Mecklenberg-Vorpommern, part of the former East Germany. 'Each day,
we send buses to collect these commuters. Over 80 per cent are women. They
work in the evening shift which starts at 5pm. And we bring them back home
at 11pm.'
Mr Livonius said Otto Versand is reaping no benefit on labour costs. 'We pay
the commuters from eastern Germany the same rates as here in Hamburg. We
cover insurance and everything else. The big difference is these people are
highly motivated and flexible. They work really hard.' The commuters travel
a total of 100 miles each day.
On the other side of Germany, Miss Katarina Fend, 21, from Rostock is living
in Coblenz. She finished studying as a midwife last year. But there were no
jobs in Rostock, her home town. 'The birth rate is plummeting in eastern
Germany. Jobs in hospitals and private practices are at a premium. So last
year I applied for a place near Coblenz. I got it. But I miss my friends. I
hope to return to Rostock, if and when the economy picks up,' she said.
Once a month she returns home to the east. 'There is no point in
complaining. There's no point in waiting for a job to turn up at home,' she
said.
Miss Fend is one of the lucky ones. As unemployment rises in west Germany,
the numbers commuting from the east are falling. In 1991, more than half a
million east Germans travelled either to west Germany, or to west Berlin, on
a daily or weekly basis. 'The official figures show unemployment has stopped
rising in eastern Germany so maybe some commuters have found work at home,'
said Ms Melanie Nassauer, an official at Berlin's federal employment office.
In 1992, the unemployment rate in east Germany topped 17 per cent. Last
year, it dipped to 15 per cent.
'But you have to look at the reality behind the official statistics,' she
added. 'What is happening is that some people, many women, for example, have
dropped off the unemployment register and now only receive welfare. In
addition, job-creation schemes are being cut because there's no money. So
these people, who are in fact jobless, do not show up on the unemployment
figures. It's pretty dismal.'
Neither Ms Nassbauer, nor her colleagues in the employment offices in
Hamburg or Rostock, can decide if unemployment benefits are so high that
they act as a disincentive for people to seek work. Although wages in the
east are only about 75 per cent of those in west Germany, benefits are
calculated on the same scale and based on the last monthly salary. For those
on short-time work, the outlook is better: they receive federal short-time
pay (equal to unemployment benefits) but remain on a company's books and can
be called upon to work.
'To tell you honestly, I had enough money to live on when I was put on
short-time work,' said east Berliner, Ms Silke Richter, a 33-year-old
languages graduate and mother of three, who works as a personal assistant.
'From late 1991 until April 1992, I received DM1,400 a month, or 90 per cent
of my last (net) salary. But there was hardly any work to do. We call it
null, or zero work. I was then made redundant, so for a while I received 72
per cent of my net salary. Later I received unemployment money, which is 67
per cent of my last salary. But I had to get a job because I was going
crazy.'
For the unemployed in Rostock, the commuters in Hamburg and the re-employed
in Berlin, reunification has brought differing experiences. But they are
united on one thing: the need to get east Germany working is paramount. It
is not enough to receive federal money to remain at home, when factories are
closing daily and west German taxpayers are resentful about the level of
subsidies for the east.
'The politicians keep telling us about how much they are spending on the
unemployed in the east,' said Mrs Geer. 'But don't they understand that
paying us to stay at home cannot compensate for our sudden loss of dignity
and status? If any party can come up with a plan to create jobs, I'll give
it my vote.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / Courting corporations: Princess Anne tells Michael Cassell
why giving is important
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Princess Royal readily admits it is hard to get the press excited about
a modest ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of one of her favourite
charities. The task becomes Herculean when, on the other side of the world,
someone chooses the same morning to take a pot-shot at her older brother.
She has already been assured Prince Charles is unharmed and, while her
security officers chat in the corridor about the drama 'down under', she
deftly fends off questions on personal safety.
It is business as usual at Church House, Westminster, where she has come to
mark the start of celebrations for Save the Children, the worldwide charity
of which she has been president for nearly 25 years. The organisation fights
not only for the rights of children from Bangladesh to Belfast but also for
badly needed funds in the increasingly competitive marketplace for
humanitarian aid.
It is 'entirely feasible', she says, that there are now too many charities
tugging at people's pockets, though one which has been around since 1919 can
hardly be accused of jumping in on the act.
'The British in particular are ferociously individualistic about the way
they approach problems. There is always an inclination to set up another
fund. As it is, there is enough money locked up and untouchable in
charitable trusts, never mind the new ones appearing all the time.'
The princess scoffs at this week's findings by an international study
suggesting that the proportion of Britons giving to charity is among the
highest of any country but that the individual amounts are stingy.
'The Spanish emerge as the biggest contributors but that's because of their
lottery, a fairly dubious definition of charitable giving.'
But isn't it shameful that an organisation which last year stretched its
Pounds 100m aid budget across 50 countries had to earmark Pounds 15m of it
for the UK? 'In any kind of welfare system there are still going to be gaps.
You have to draw boundaries around state help; there are problems enough
already.
'There will always be elements of our community more at risk than others and
areas which confront discrimination and need help. Look at gypsies and the
families of prisoners.' So has any progress really been made, or does the
world stagger from one disaster to the next, learning nothing? 'There have
been big, incremental improvements. The point of the exercise is that, when
aid workers move on, people have acquired the skills to look after
themselves. But helping people to help themselves is very hard work.'
The quality of help, she insists, is now high: 'Today, if you are not
careful, standards in the camps are higher than in surrounding areas. That
can cause big problems.'
In recognising the uphill struggle to get companies and individuals to play
their part in 'championing children' around the world, she quotes Eglantyne
Jebb, the forgotten founder of Save the Children: 'The world is not
ungenerous but unimaginative and very busy.'
The princess sees Jebb as an 'unsung heroine' whose anger at the plight of
children laid the foundations for the UN Convention on the Rights of the
Child. She says the woman deserves a place in the hall of fame alongside
names like Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry. The princess's
four-year-old English bull terrier is even named Eglantyne.
The Queen's daughter is used to being portrayed as ice cool, doing her bit
for disadvantaged children, but not the child-hugging, motherly type. She
responds with characteristic directness: 'I don't believe holding children
is going to make much difference to their long-term happiness. Jebb didn't
make a habit of it either.'
She is not averse, however, to embracing a few more big British companies to
help fund the organisation's work. Its corporate membership scheme, under
which big players undertake to raise Pounds 100,000 a year for at least
three years, still has room for others to join the likes of Tesco, British
Airways and Unilever.
It may be a big commitment but, as the princess points out, 'some at least
have found it a very useful weapon in resisting the countless letters which
pour in asking for help'. But she says it is as much about contributing
ideas and making time and there can be big commercial benefits given an
effective charity strategy.
So what would the old campaigner think of Save the Children 65 years after
her death and of the job left unfinished? 'I expect she would have been even
more cross than she was in 1919. There is still so much to be done.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Europeans talk about security in the post-cold war world, they often
find they are not talking about the same thing. Germany worries about the
stability of its central European neighbours; Britain worries about the
health of the Atlantic alliance; Mediterranean countries worry about their
Arab neighbours, especially Algeria. All those worries are legitimate, and
should be addressed by the EU's common foreign and security policy. The
last, especially, should be taken more seriously in northern Europe than it
has been so far.
Two years ago the Algerian army intervened to forestall the election victory
of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). It proposed to smash the violent hard
core of the opposition while introducing economic reforms to restore hope to
those who had joined it out of despair. That strategy has not worked. In
fact the economic side of it has not even been tried. The bold economic
reforms launched between 1989 and 1991 have been reversed, making impossible
any deal with the IMF and Algeria's other creditors on the country's Dollars
25bn foreign debt, which will absorb 100 per cent of its export revenue this
year.
Politically, Islamic militants denied power through the ballot box have
turned to violence. Repression, accompanied by human rights violations, has
further radicalised the opposition, and even secular parties boycotted the
'national consensus conference' held by the regime this week, since the
exclusion of the FIS deprived it of credibility. The country is sliding into
civil war.
These developments threaten Europe on several levels. Civil war invariably
produces large flows of refugees, many of whom in this case would be bound
to cross the Mediterranean. Their arrival would exacerbate racial tensions.
The war could spread to north African communities in Europe. Islamic
militants, if they lose, might resort to terrorism not only against
Europeans in Algeria but against targets in Europe itself. If they win after
a long and bitter struggle, Europe would face a prickly and hostile
neighbour within easy missile range. Either way, an Algeria racked by civil
war and deprived of much of its westernised middle class would not attract
foreign investment and would be likely to stagnate economically. Europe
could face more and more poor and angry people on its very doorstep.
Only a genuine dialogue between the army and the FIS offers any hope of a
peaceful solution. The EU should use its good offices to help bring this
about. By promising economic aid and increased market access for a peaceful,
democratic Algeria, it could offer an incentive to both sides to negotiate,
and reassurance to those in the country who fear that an Islamic victory
would mean isolation from Europe and wholesale suppression of human rights.
Continued support for the status quo can only store up worse trouble for the
future.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Public business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inadequate financial controls, failure to comply with rules, poor management
of projects and an absence of clear lines of accountability. These would be
damaging criticisms if made about the conduct of business in the private
sector. When made of the UK public service, they are devastating.
Yet these criticisms - and many others - were made yesterday by the Commons
Public Accounts Committee in a report on the conduct of organisations which
consume public funds. The report draws on 17 studies over the past four
years into serious failures in the stewardship of public money. These range
from the provision of official cars to executives without requiring them to
pay for private motoring to the loss of at least Pounds 20m on a computer
project for the Wessex regional health authority.
It would be tempting to blame such failures on the management changes in the
public services introduced by the present government. Much of the work of
delivering public services has been handed over to executive agencies and
quangos, under looser Whitehall control. Private contractors have been
brought in to do large parts of the work of the health service, central
government and local authorities. Public sector managers are being
encouraged to break away from bureaucratic administration and manage their
services more entrepreneurially.
By moving away from top-down administration, such reforms open up
opportunities for weakening control over public money. The standards of
equity and probity required in handling taxpayers' money can be easily
forgotten - especially when managers are brought in from outside the public
service. Conflicts of interest, inadequate oversight and ineffective
monitoring can all result when bureaucracy is swept away.
Yet none of these outcomes is inevitable with public service reform, as the
committee's report notes. The many successful examples of public sector
reform demonstrate that traditional standards of public business do not need
to be sacrificed to pursue efficiency and effectiveness. According to the
report, no new rules are needed: the problems arise when existing rules are
breached.
Such breaches are more likely when management change is driven through with
excessive haste. This leads to neglect of proper controls and
accountability. And it puts responsibility into the hands of staff who have
not acquired the necessary financial training and experience. A more
measured approach will in the end achieve better results and avoid
discrediting reform.
But the importance of scrutiny and oversight is also a clear message of the
report. The Public Accounts Committee's writ should be extended to all
bodies which largely depend on public money for their income, including the
growing numbers of quangos which have assumed much of the responsibility for
spending public money.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste management should also mean
producing less rubbish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GEORGINA WATKINS-SPIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Two articles on waste management on one day ('Recycling has neighbours
crying foul' and 'When waste is not wanted', January 25), but not the
smallest mention of the crux of the problem: the need to produce less
rubbish. The impact on other countries' waste disposal markets of Germany's
efficiency at collection should at last induce Europe's legislators to force
manufacturers to use less packaging - or at least more of the reusable kind.
In Germany, most people cart crates of glass bottles full of mineral water,
fruit juice, beer, etc, back and forth to the supermarket as a matter of
course, but dairy products, for example, are rarely obtainable in anything
but plastic - though milk is available in bottles here for the more
conscientious. The mere thought of the millions of sordid plastic yoghurt
pots alone discarded every day enrages me.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unrecognised benefits of road
transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE HOLLINGSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are sound economic reasons why consumers need to be given
consistent and accurate information if they are to make efficient choices
about transport ('Fading blueprint of a greener world', January 26).
Unfortunately, the chapter of Professor Pearce's book, Measuring Sustainable
Development, which deals with transport makes two fundamental errors. These
invalidate his conclusions that road transport fails to pay for its full
costs.
First, government tax revenues from road transport were Pounds 23bn last
year, not the Pounds 14.7bn which he cites. It is true that many motoring
taxes are in forms which do not help motorists' understanding of transport
costs since they do not in many cases relate to usage. A motoring tax system
based on use rather than ownership and purchase of vehicles would improve
economic and environmental efficiency. The total tax-take is already
sufficient to meet the full costs but a reform of the tax structure should
relate tax more closely to usage.
Second, Professor Pearce includes congestion costs as an external cost of
the road transport system. This is not the case. While it is true that
congestion costs are highly wasteful and should be reduced, they are
inflicted by motorists on one another not on non-road users. Congestion
costs are therefore internal costs which have already been paid for by road
users in lost time and extra fuel used. To require motorists to pay these
charges again would amount to massive double counting.
If these factors are taken into account then, using Professor Pearce's
figures, road taxes exceed road costs by Pounds 6bn. Motoring costs are not
twice the amount 'fetched by road taxes'. There is, in fact, no objective
basis for any increase in the overall taxation level from road use though
the structure of existing taxes and other motoring costs could be improved
significantly.
It is also the case that fewer people are killed and injured on Britain's
roads than previously, though still not few enough. Air pollution from
vehicles is declining rapidly as new cars are fitted with catalysts and
vehicles are becoming quieter. Most of the social costs associated with road
transport are in fact falling.

From Mr Paul Everitt.
Sir, The assertion that road users do not pay enough for the use of
Britain's road network is undermined by a number of significant omissions
('Fading blueprint of a greener world'). Not only does it underestimate the
existing tax burden by some Pounds 7bn, but completely ignores the existence
of significant benefits that accrue from road use.
Surely we should look at the value of having more than 2m people employed in
the road transport sector, or the increased leisure and work opportunities
that road use allows Britain's citizens. How much value do we place on the
availability of fresh produce and product choice in our shops at prices that
can be afforded?
Increasing the cost of road use will have a direct impact on the cost of
living of individuals and the profitability of British industry. Road
pricing will have much wider social and economic impacts than is recognised
by Professor Pearce and a balance sheet that ignores them represents an
incomplete analysis.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A proposal too far for directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S G KAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the proposals concealed within the article 'Risks
for directors grow', by Graham Maw (Survey on International Legal Services,
January 25), which go further than the Cadbury report.
As a practising and, I hope, professional chief executive, I am increasingly
concerned at the range and number of bodies and committees giving
well-intentioned advice to me. There will be so many checks and balances
that there will be no room for progress.
In particular, I do not agree with Mr Maw that a remuneration committee
should be wholly non-executive. I am in the best position to know the detail
of my subordinates' performance and I wish to have a direct say in their
salary and other rewards. The Cadbury recommendation for a remuneration
committee to be 'wholly or mainly' non-executive provides for me to be a
member of that committee.
Inveresk supports both the spirit and the letter of Cadbury, but not
further.
Has Mr Maw, I wonder, experienced the pressures of the real commercial
world?

FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keeping an eye on banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CHAMBERLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wish I shared the confidence of Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, that banks are committed to providing finance to small
businesses ('George calls for a cut in recriminations', January 18).
Chartered accountants around the UK report that their clients are still
experiencing significant problems with banks. Small ventures today are too
often unable to obtain finance at anything like reasonable interest rates.
Just as worrying are reports of banks offering finance only if clients
accept unwanted and/or unduly expensive insurance products as part of the
financing package.
The governor is right that very many small businesses lack financial and
management skills. Good business advice, whether from Training and
Enterprise Councils, Business Links or chartered accountants, is generally a
crucial element in the success or failure of small businesses. I also
welcome the emphasis on the need for banks to ensure that lending staff are
properly trained. I hope the shift towards specialist business centres in
banks does not mitigate against small companies.
The Bank of England report places small business finance on the public
agenda. But translating that into a new era of understanding and support
from bank managers requires action on the ground. My members and their
clients will no doubt be watching closely.
