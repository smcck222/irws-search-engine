FT  27 JAN 94 / US to act on cable TV price loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Communi-cations Commission is expected to revise its rules on
cable television pricing at a meeting next month, writes George Graham.
The FCC has been criticised for leaving too many loopholes for cable TV
operators to exploit in the rules it wrote implementing a 1992 law designed
to crack down on overpricing.
That law, the only legislation on which former President George Bush saw his
veto overridden by a two-thirds majority of Congress, authorised the FCC to
set reasonable rates for the majority of cable companies who hold a monopoly
in their district.
The issue was a popular vote-getter in the 1992 election, striking a chord
with customers. But many consumers felt the immediate effect of the
legislation was higher rates, not the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) in cuts they
had been promised.
An early survey suggesting that as many as 50 per cent of customers might
face higher bills for their cable TV captured widespread attention. A later
study of 14 of the largest operators showed, however, that rates had fallen
for 68 per cent of customers. Nevertheless, many cable companies have dodged
the FCC rules by manipulating tariffs.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Hussein willing to hold direct talks with Rabin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
King Hussein of Jordan said yesterday for the first time he was willing to
meet Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, in a move that could bolster
efforts to reach a broad Middle East peace.
'I hope an opportunity will arise before too long,' King Hussein said after
meeting Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in Washington. 'Its
normal when moving toward peace that people meet.' Such a meeting could take
place before full peace was established, the king said.
His offer breaks with his and other Arab leaders' long-stated policy of
refusing to meet Israeli leaders openly. It will put pressure on
Palestinians to strike a deal with Israel in talks which remained deadlocked
in Cairo yesterday over implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho.
Israel, anxious for increasing Arab recognition abroad and peace dividends
at home, has been urging Washington to arrange a summit meeting with King
Hussein in return for US assistance with Jordan's external debt.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, met the king secretly in Jordan
last November. Israel says a detailed peace agreement with Jordan was
concluded, but the king has been reluctant to sign a formal peace with
Israel ahead of Syria and Lebanon.
The king's move is likely to stir protest in Jordan, where parliamentarians
yesterday condemned a visit by 83 Jewish Rabbis last week and attacked the
government for letting them in. But lately he has pushed far ahead of Moslem
fundamentalists and others in Jordan who strongly reject peace with Israel
and has outlined his vision of an unfolding peace based on regional economic
co-operation and trade.
The king has made it clear that, while he is still committed to a
comprehensive peace, Jordan is no longer willing to wait indefinitely for
progress in talks between Israel and other Arab states. 'We are not waiting
for anybody but we hope that as things move we will all meet before too long
having accomplished our work in establishing a just and lasting peace,' he
said.
The king's offer will be warmly welcomed in Israel, which has been focusing
recent moves on appealing to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to assure a
sceptical Israeli public about Syria's intentions towards the Jewish state.
Mr Rabin said yesterday his government 'yearned' to strike a lasting
regional peace agreement this year and urged Mr Assad to 'go the extra mile'
and assure the Israeli public that Syria had long-term peaceful intentions
towards the Jewish state.
Speaking in Strasbourg, Mr Rabin urged Syria and other Arab states not to
lose precious time and to seek agreement in Washington. 'Israel is ready for
peace and willing to take risks and make dramatic decisions .. We are
looking for a peace that would last for generations to come - a peace that
will put an end to the suffering and fear of all the peoples of the Middle
East.'
Mr Rabin's remarks came after President Ezer Weizman showered rare praise on
the Syrian leader, saying he held the key to peace and was a man of
integrity, sincerity and honour.
In Cairo, Israeli and Palestinian officials held lengthy talks to try to
hammer out an agreed document after weeks of fruitless negotiations focused
on control over border crossings. Israeli officials sought to damp hopes
that Mr Peres and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would be able to sign an
agreement when they meet in Switzerland at the weekend.

<TEXT>
Egypt has won aid pledges of between Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn a year to
help bolster its economic reforms, Mr Youssef Boutros-Ghali, minister of
state for international co-operation, said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Paris.
Mr Boutros-Ghali, in Paris for a meeting with aid donors, said he had
informal contacts with the Paris Club of creditor nations and said a debt
relief programme was proceeding normally.
Egypt is due to get a final 20 per cent of debt forgiveness in July
following a 1991 deal in which the Paris Club agreed to halve Egypt's
official debt in return for its role in the Gulf War, on condition that it
pursue economic reforms.
Of this amount, almost Dollars 1bn is likely to come from the US, western
officials said. Washington also gives Cairo military and other aid.

United News of India said that the government issued an ordinance to allow
foreign investment in mining firms and lift restrictions on foreign equity
holding.
The ordinance would permit any company registered in India, irrespective of
its foreign equity holding, to apply for a mining lease or prospecting
license. Earlier laws restricted foreign equity in these companies to 40 per
cent.

Turkey has expressed apprehension over the spectre of Russian military
involvement in the Caucasus and Central Asia, where there are large
Turkic-speaking populations. 'This is a black hole into which Turkey is
trying not to sink,' said Mr Ozdem Samberk, Turkey's deputy foreign
minister, writes Steve LeVine.
Turkish officials are also smarting over the shelving of a Dollars 1.4bn
(Pounds 938m) pipeline they had been championing to carry oil from
Azerbaijan, through Turkey, to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Instead,
Moscow has been putting pressure on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to ship oil
and natural gas through the Russian Black Sea port at Novorossisk.
'The West must make a distinction between support of democracy in Russia,
and support for the restoration of its imperial designs,' Mr Samberk said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Philippines in credit agreement with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippines has negotiated a new credit facility of SDR475m (Pounds
436.5m) with the International Monetary Fund to support the Philippines'
growth-oriented economic programme for the three years to 1997.
The agreement was concluded yesterday by a visiting technical team from the
Fund and a panel of government officials led by Mr Gabriel Singson, governor
of Bangko Sentral, the central bank.
The IMF has closely supervised the drafting of Manila's economic policies
since the early 1960s.
Mr Singson expressed his belief that the new IMF credit programme will help
'lay a firm basis for faster and sustainable (economic) growth.'
The Philippines, which has been without an IMF economic programme since
March 1993, has managed to sustain economic growth as well as to control
inflation and monetary expansion.
The credit will come from the IMF's Extended Fund Facility, the
institution's window for medium-term financing. Previous programmes for the
country had been standby agreements, which were for shorter periods and
carried tough conditions.
The new programme should enable the Philippine government to attain this
year's growth target of 4.5 per cent, after last year's 2.5 per cent.
Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, said: 'This is it. We can now
proceed with our plans to move our economy forward and achieve our
aspiration to join the club of newly industrialising countries by the turn
of the century.'
The programme, which is subject to further review by the IMF technical team
before formal board approval around April, targets economic growth to rise
to 6.5 per cent next year and about 8 per cent by 1997.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, is expected to visit Manila
in February. That will be followed by a visit by Mr Lewis Preston, the World
Bank president, in March or April.
Mr Ramos yesterday appointed Mr Roberto de Ocampo, currently chairman of the
state-run Development Bank of the Philippines, as new finance secretary from
February 1.
He will replace Mr Ernest Leung, who has been acting finance secretary since
the middle of last year, when Mr Ramos's initial nominee for the post, Mr
Ramon del Rosario, was rejected by the congressional Commission on
Appointments.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Rabin calls on Syria to go extra mile for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's leaders have made unusual efforts to appeal to President Hafez
al-Assad of Syria as negotiations towards a comprehensive Middle East peace
continued in Washington yesterday.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, said yesterday his government
'yearned' to strike a lasting regional peace agreement this year and urged
Mr Assad to 'go the extra mile' and assure Israelis that Syria had
long-term, peaceful intentions towards the Jewish state.
In a solemn address to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe
in Strasbourg, Mr Rabin urged Syria and other Arab states not to lose
precious time and to seek bilateral agreements in Washington. 'Israel is
ready for peace and willing to take risks and make dramatic decisions but
any risk or decision should be well calculated.'
Mr Rabin said Israel needed to be sure that Syria genuinely means peace and
security. 'We are looking for a peace that would last for generations to
come - a peace that will put an end to the suffering and fear of all the
peoples of the Middle East.'
In an emotional moment, Mr Rabin recalled his days as army chief of staff
during the 1967 Six Day War: 'Only one who year after year stands facing
thousands and ten of thousands of silent mourners in the cemeteries on our
memorial day - only one who has seen worlds destroyed and families
devastated - knows just how important is peace to us and also for our
neighbours.'
However, he also warned Palestinian extremists who reject peace with Israel.
'To them I say: no knife, no stone, no firearm, no bomb, no landmine will
stop us. We will continue to strike hard without flinching . . . We strive
for peace but we will continue to fight for our right to live in Israel in
peace and tranquility.'
Mr Rabin accused some European nations of ambivalence towards the Jewish
state and urged Europeans to help break the Arab economic boycott of Israel.
He said Europe should take a more direct role in Middle East peace talks,
adding that Israel did not need Europe's money which should be directed to
Palestinians to help consolidate the peace agreement. He also made a
surprise offer to allow Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi to visit Islamic holy
sites in Jerusalem.
Mr Rabin's remarks came a day after Israel's President Ezer Weizman showered
rare praise on the Syrian leader, saying he held the key to Middle East
peace and was a man of integrity, sincerity and honour. 'I see the key to
further peace in the Middle East in finding a solution to Syria, which
obviously depends on President Assad. And I still see Assad as a leader
through whom peace can be achieved,' Mr Weizman said during a visit to
Turkey.
Israeli officials said secret bilateral talks with Syria in Washington have
shown signs of progress since Mr Assad said he wanted 'normal' peaceful
relations with Israel during a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Geneva
earlier this month.
As Israel focussed on peace talks with Syria, Israeli and Palestinian
officials continued lengthy talks in Cairo to hammer out an agreed document
that would break the deadlock on implementation of Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Israeli officials sought to
dampen hopes that Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir
Arafat, PLO chairman, would sign an agreement when they meet in Switzerland
at the weekend.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK is odd man out in China diplomacy: Beijing eases
conflicts with other security council members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen concluded a visit to Paris this
week, he achieved more than simply restoring equilibrium to a troubled
relationship.
The Sino-French rapprochement means that China has now reduced the number of
serious diplomatic conflicts with fellow members of the world's most
exclusive club, the UN Security Council, to one - its dispute with Britain
over Hong Kong.
Nothing could have contrasted more sharply than the emollient words uttered
in Paris at the conclusion of Mr Qian's visit and the continuing sour
exchanges between Beijing and London.
Indeed, troubled Sino-British relations appear to have taken a further turn
for the worse with the row over the financing of the new Hong Kong airport
flaring up in a way that does not augur well for amicable resolution.
China's warning that it would refuse to honour after 1997 financing for the
new HKDollars 160bn (Pounds 13.9bn) airport project threatens to strike at
the heart of arrangements for a smooth transfer of power. No other capital
works project is as important to Hong Kong's integration with the mainland,
and the colony's future economic well-being.
Britain's problems with China have also been cast in starker relief in
recent days by the conspicuous improvement in fractious Sino-US relations
after Washington's decision last September to end the 'downward spiral' in
its dealings with the People's Republic.
Since the Clinton administration resolved to 're-engage' China, a steady
stream of senior American officials has passed through Beijing, culminating
in the visit last week of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary.
These visits have also been accompanied by tangible progress on bothersome
issues, including trade disputes, smuggling and illegal immigration. The
signing this month, after reasonably amicable negotiations, of a three-year
textile quota agreement attested to an improved working relationship.
Efforts to lay the groundwork for renewal by President Clinton of most
favoured nation (MFN) trading status for China by obliging Beijing to
address the human rights issue appear to be making progress; but US
officials say that China is still some distance away from meeting Mr
Clinton's criteria of 'overall, significant improvement' on human rights.
In Paris this week, China appeared to make an important concession by
agreeing to discuss for the first time specific US concerns about 235
political prisoners. That undertaking came at a meeting between Mr Qian and
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state.
While Mr Christopher repeated a standard administration line after his
session with Mr Qian that China had not met the criteria for continued
preferential access to the US market, there is no doubt that odds on MFN
renewal have shortened.
'This meeting has carried the process forward but we also believe there is
considerable work to be done,' said Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of
state, former US ambassador to Beijing and chief architect of the Clinton
administration's policy on China.
A western official in Beijing said that while human rights issues were
certain to continue to bedevil China's dealings with the west, there were
tentative signs that Beijing may at last be recognising that it could not
continue to stonewall western pressures.
'The Americans may have finally convinced the Chinese of the US domestic
reality, and that they will have to do something tangible on human rights,'
he said. 'The cynical release of a few prisoners on the eve of the MFN
decision simply won't fly any more.'
China's fence-mending with both the French and the Americans also coincides
with the visit to Beijing this week of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister at the head of a mission which includes defence experts.
China is seeking increased Russian assistance in the development of its
defence industries. It is also anxious to further expand and regulate
booming border trade. Total trade between Russia and China increased by 30
per cent last year compared with 1993. Eighty per cent of this trade is
conducted through some 20 border crossings.
For the Russians, no less than for the Americans and French, access to the
booming China market is the engine driving diplomatic relations. France's
decision to foreswear further arms sales to Taiwan as the price of better
China relations - what France's President Francois Mitterrand described as a
'new orientation' - is recognition of China's growing economic clout.
For London, mired in a seemingly intractable dispute over Hong Kong, the
unhappy prospect is for continued sour exchanges with Beijing, accompanied
by the risk of damage to UK commercial prospects. Emboldened by its success
in forcing France to stop new arms sales to Taiwan, and assuming that it
clears the MFN hurdle, Beijing is even less likely to yield ground over Hong
Kong.

FT  27 JAN 94 / US defence missiles for S Korea: Patriot batteries to
protect against surprise attack from North
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday said it would send Patriot air defence missiles to South
Korea to protect the South against any surprise missile attack from North
Korea. The confirmation in Washington by US Defence Undersecretary Frank
Wisner followed strong indications from South Korean foreign ministry
officials that the deployment would go ahead.
The discussions between Washington and Seoul reflect increased concern about
military tensions on the Korean peninsula following North Korea's refusal to
allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
'The threat of North Korean missiles is very real,' said Mr Hong Soon-young,
South Korea's vice foreign minister. North Korea last year tested the
Rodong-I, an improved version of the Soviet Scud missile with an estimated
range of 1,000km.
The stationing of Patriot missiles would be the first publicly announced
strengthening of US forces in South Korea since North Korea blocked nuclear
inspections a year ago.
The South Korean defence ministry last week warned there was a risk of an
North Korean attack this year or next.
Mr Rhee Byoung-tae, the defence minister, said North Korea completed
preparations for war last year and has proclaimed 1995 as the year for
unification of the country.
If the nuclear issue remains unresolved or if the North Korean government is
threatened by internal disturbances because of food or fuel shortages, then
Pyongyang might attempt a military attack in a desperate bid to find a
solution to its problems, he added.
The deployment of the Patriot missiles, which were used against Iraqi Scud
missiles during the 1991 Gulf war, might begin if no progress is made soon
in North Korea's negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency
and the US on nuclear inspections.
The presidents of two South Korean commercial banks will be dismissed by the
government in response to a new financial scandal, the country's finance
minister said yesterday.
The action to sack the heads of the Bank of Seoul and Donghwa Bank follows
the arrest on Monday of Ms Chang Young-ja, a relative of former President
Chun Doo-hwan, on fraud charges.
She allegedly swindled at least Won10.7bn (Pounds 8.8m) using dishonoured
commercial bills, while withdrawing funds from anonymous accounts at the two
banks. Ms Chang was at the centre of one of South Korea's biggest financial
scandals in 1982 and served 10 years in prison before being released on
parole.
The government has great influence in appointing and dismissing the
presidents of the nation's commercial banks.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Central Asians cut loose from Moscow: An attempt to
establish a tripartite economic union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest republics in Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are
reducing their dependence on Russia in the run-up to their agreed formation
of a common market with Kyrgyzstan on February 1.
The breach became evident at the start of the year when Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan formed their own economic union and gained momentum this week
when Kyrgyzstan joined the breakaway grouping, representing open antagonism
from a region which had previously valued close ties with Moscow and even
opposed the Soviet break-up.
The new distaste for and worry about Moscow follow increasingly vocal
demands from Russia for part of the wealth in the resource-rich Caucasus and
Central Asia, particularly giant oil and natural gas deals under negotiation
in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
The demands for percentages and equity holdings in exploration and
extraction contracts have been echoed by Russian nationalists such as Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky who insist on reclaiming the empire and the spoils that
go with it.
In loosening ties with Moscow, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have
also moved away from their two Central Asian neighbours, Tajikistan and
Turkmenistan, both of which have elected to remain as either economic or
political satellites. Tajikistan has handed over supervision of both its
security and economy to Moscow, while Turkmenistan is pursuing a course of
appeasement with Moscow.
Kazakhstan, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the former Soviet
Union, including two of the world's 10 largest oil fields, has recently
altered the tone of its statements on Russia to almost open hostility.
Despite Kazakhstan's vulnerability to its northern neighbour, with an ethnic
Russian population of 38 per cent, the republic's state secretary, Mr
Tulebek Zhukeev, has taken the risky step of publicly denouncing Moscow's
'imperial ambitions'.
Mr Zhukeev recently announced his government would charge Russia Dollars 7bn
in annual rent for the Baykanur space station and two military test sites.
Demonstrating the sentiment behind the pricey demands, Mr Zhukeev declared:
'This will bankrupt Russia.'
The Kazakh government has reason to be upset with Russia. While demanding
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 803m) in 1993 debts to Russian state enterprises,
Moscow has not paid for huge coal shipments from Kazakhstan's Karagan
region. At the same time, raw material shipments from Russia have become
unreliable.
The Central Asian economic union is meant to co-ordinate economic, monetary
and labour policy. It would create a region larger than western Europe, with
a combined population of 48m but possessing as much oil and mineral wealth
as some leading Gulf states. The grouping will abolish customs procedures
and tariffs and co-operate on economic policies. It aims to encourage growth
of trade between members.
Another motive, however, is to erect a front-line defence against Moscow's
growing political demands, including one that ethnic Russian citizens in
Central Asia be granted dual nationality, a demand rejected by Uzbekistan
and Kazakhstan as an unacceptable infringement of their sovereignty.
In short, the Kazakh and Uzbek leaderships want Moscow to back off. This may
not be accomplished, said a senior diplomat in Tashkent, but at the least
'the union makes it easier to deal with Russia both economically and
politically'.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Hosokawa to fight on even if reforms fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, said yesterday he plans to
fight on, even if parliament fails to pass his political and electoral
reform plans by Saturday, the end of the present session.
Mr Hosokawa denied earlier reports from one of his own top advisers that he
would resign or disband the cabinet if the plans remained blocked by then.
'There's no chance of that,' he was reported as saying.
His remarks added to the confusion over the ruling coalition's intentions
following Friday's surprise parliamentary vote against the four reform bills
on which Mr Hosokawa has staked his future. The bills propose tough controls
on political funding and the abandonment of multi-seat electoral districts,
blamed for encouraging politicians to compete for votes on their ability to
shower voters with cash and favours. Many members of parliament fear they
would lose their seats as a result, but public support for reform is strong.
Mr Hosokawa was planning to make a television appeal for public backing
yesterday, but apparently changed his mind on the grounds that this might
jeopardise his final attempt to reach an accord with the opposition Liberal
Democratic party.
In a sign of encouragement for Mr Hosokawa, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, a leading
member of a 70-strong group of pro-reform LDP members of parliament, said he
would back the government's bill if it came to a forced final vote.
However, the rest of the LDP seemed as unclear about the next step as the
coalition. The opposition LDP set stiff conditions yesterday for a
compromise deal with Mr Hosokawa, in the latest stage in an increasingly
arcane round of horse-trading.
But the LDP then confusingly told a parliamentary panel, set up to discuss
the possible compromise, it was not prepared for a debate. The panel session
lasted a bare five minutes.
Mr Yoshio Mori, the LDP's secretary general, later told television news that
he was 'not in a position to comment at this time on what we plan to do'.
The LDP's latest compromise plan calls for an increase in the number of
single-seat constituencies proposed by the government from 274 to 300, and
reducing the number of seats chosen through proportional representation from
the coalition's 226 to 200. This is an increase on the LDP's previous demand
last month for a 280-seat constituency system  - and as such can be taken as
a hardening of its position.
Proportional seats would come from 11 districts, rather than the
government's proposed single national constituency, under the LDP's latest
plan. The proposed ban on corporate donations to individual politicians
would be lifted.
The seven-party coalition, however, cannot afford to accept the LDP's latest
plan because the Social Democratic party, on which it depends for a
majority, is unshakeably committed to a ban on corporate donations to
individuals.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PepsiCo, the US food and soft drinks group, has reached an agreement with
the Chinese government that will let it open 10 new bottling plants in China
over the next five years, at a cost of Dollars 350m (Pounds 235m).
The group already has eight joint-venture bottling plants in China and
announced last week that it was setting up a ninth. The new deal, though,
would give the group its first access to China's vast interior, more than
doubling the group's sales volumes in China, PepsiCo said.
The new bottling plants will be joint ventures with government subsidiaries
and will produce such PepsiCo-branded drinks as Pepsi-Cola, 7UP and Mirinda,
with other carbonated and non-carbonated beverages under local brands.
PepsiCo entered China in 1982, since when its production for the market
there has risen to 40m cases a year. It said the new agreement would put it
at the forefront of international investment in the world's largest consumer
market.

FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Mozambique builds on peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MAPUTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mozambique is poised to become an energy exporter, thanks to the end of the
country's 17-year civil war and to an international project to rebuild power
lines supplying electricity to South Africa from the Cahora Bassa
hydro-electric dam.
Portugal, the former colonial power, South Africa and Mozambique are
finalising the details of a Dollars 105m (Pounds 70m) financial package to
rebuild 1,800 pylons destroyed by South African-backed rebels in their war
against the Marxist government in Maputo.
When energy exports can resume, Cahora Bassa will be Mozambique's biggest
export earner with estimated revenues of Dollars 56m a year, according to Mr
Manuel Lopes da Costa, Portuguese ambassador in Maputo. The economy now can
barely muster export revenues of Dollars 200m a year.
South Africa has agreed to supply new electricity towers worth Dollars 48m.
Portugal will finance the procurement of cables and isolators with Dollars
27m.
Italy had agreed to contribute Dollars 35m but withdrew last year when its
foreign aid programme came under investigation for corruption.
Mr Lopes da Costa hopes the European Union, France or the European
Development Bank will fill the gap left by the Italians.
Cahora Bassa is a 2,000 MW dam on the Zambezi river, completed in 1977. Its
transmission lines were a favourite and frequent target of Renamo rebels in
the early 1980s. More than 200km of lines were destroyed and Cahora Bassa is
operating at only 1.5 per cent capacity.
Portugal, which built the dam and holds the operating concession, has spent
Dollars 35m a year to keep it in working order. Mozambique, although
entitled to a share of Cahora Bassa's export earnings, has not seen a penny
because the contracts to supply the South African electricity grid have not
been fulfilled.
Mr Jose Miguel Nicolau, planning director at the national power company,
Electricidade de Mocambique, hopes reconstruction will begin in July, at the
start of the dry season. It should take 36 months to complete.

FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan persevere in trade talks -
Search for pre-summit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Japanese officials resumed technical discussions yesterday on
improving access to key sectors of the Japanese market, after failing to
make progress in higher-level talks that broke up on Tuesday night.
Senior US officials said there were still 'substantial stumbling blocks' in
the way of reaching a satisfactory agreement in time for the summit meeting
of President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in
Washington on February 11.
The Clinton administration is seeking expanded US exports to Japan under a
framework agreement negotiated last year, and is targeting Japanese barriers
to sales of cars and automotive parts, insurance, and government procurement
of medical and telecommunications equipment.
However, a US official said talks in the automotive sector were 'at a
complete impasse', while progress so far on insurance and government
procurement was marginal.
US officials said there were still major problems both over the goals they
would like to set for increased market penetration, and over the objective
criteria they insist on setting to measure progress.
'If there are no objective criteria, there are no agreements - period,' said
a senior negotiator.
Other officials reiterated the US position that they would rather have no
agreements than sign something that failed to achieve their market access
goals, but they said that it was too early to write off the possibility of
reaching a satisfactory deal.
'The rhythm of these things has always been that there's an awfully slow
run-up,' one senior offical said.
Under the framework agreement, the US committed itself to reduce its budget
deficit and increase its national savings and competitiveness, while Japan
promised to achieve a highly significant reduction in its trade surplus with
the US, as well as a significant increase in import penetration.
In Tokyo, Mr Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile
Manufacturers' Association, has called on Japan to create a market
environment that would assure US carmakers sales in Japan of 100,000
vehicles a year in three years' time. This would be used as a benchmark
figure to measure US access to the Japanese car market.
Mr Card, who served as transportation secretary under President George Bush,
indicated that such a benchmark would help US carmakers justify making the
necessary effort to penetrate further the Japanese market by ensuring that
their work would be rewarded.
Last year, US carmakers exported about 14,000 cars to Japan.
His remarks reflect the continuing insistence on the US part on the use of
quantitative targets in opening Japan's markets to foreign goods despite
repeated Japanese resistance to such targets on the grounds that these would
lead to managed trade.
Continuing failure to break the deadlock in the bilateral trade talks,
despite several sessions, has led to growing friction and distrust between
negotiators on each side.
While each side insists that the Clinton-Hosokawa summit is still scheduled
to go ahead, in spite of the current political turmoil in Japan and the
receding possibility that concrete US-Japanese agreements can be hammered
out in time, there are also growing signs that the US is reviewing its
options in case the summit is postponed or turns out to be unsatisfactory.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said in Tokyo this week that the US
might have to review the basis of its trade talks with Japan if the
framework negotiations on trade and economic matters were to prove
unsatisfactory.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broad support for wide-ranging talks on the links between trade and the
environment was voiced yesterday by members of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, at their annual meeting in Geneva.
Ministers are to meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round
accords. They also are due to approve a Gatt work programme on trade and
environment, the details of which will be thrashed out in negotiations among
the world trade body's 115 members over the next two months.
However, trade officials said yesterday that these negotiations had only
just started in earnest and that many governments had yet to take a firm
position on the issues to be covered.
Gatt's working group on environmental measures and international trade,
which reported to the annual meeting yesterday, has already paved the way
for further work in three key areas: the trade provisions of international
environmental agreements, transparency of national environment regulations,
and the trade effects of packaging and labelling requirements aimed at
protecting the environment.
However, environmental groups are pressing for the work programme to include
'eco-dumping' - the competitive advantage alleged to be gained by countries
with low environmental standards - and the ability of governments to
restrict imports produced in environmentally unfriendly ways.
The annual meeting earlier decided:
To establish an independent disputes panel to examine claims by several
tobacco-producing nations that new US rules on local content for cigarette
manufacturers are illegal under Gatt;
To set up a working party to negotiate Gatt entry terms for Jordan.

Zimmer, a Frankfurt engineering and construction group, has won a DM140m
(Pounds 53m) turn-key contract to equip and start a polyester plant in
Acheng City, 1,000km north-east of Beijing.
The order, by China Heilongjiang Polyester Plant and China National
Machinery and Equipment, brings the total number of polymer and synthetic
fibre contracts undertaken by Zimmer in China to 45 in the past 17 years.
The new plant is due to be commissioned in 1996. The contract includes
fitting out a polyester polycondensation plant with an annual capacity of
80,000 tonnes of polyester chips and polymer, and a staple fibre spinning
facility.
Liquid polymer output will be used in a single-line process to produce up to
33,000 tonnes of polyester staple fibre a year.
Finance will come via a credit facility of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
and the Bank of China for a Hermes-covered buyer's credit of 85 per cent of
the order value.

South-east Asian nations should increase trade among themselves if they want
to maintain the pace of economic growth in their region, an official of the
European Parliament said yesterday, AP reports from Manila.
Mr Ben Visser, first vice-chairman of a visiting 19-member European
Parliament delegation, spoke to a news conference at the end of a three-day
visit, the first stop on a tour which will also take them to Thailand,
Vietnam and South Korea.
Mr Visser, from the Netherlands, said the six members of the Association of
South-east Asian Nations should spearhead trade in the region. He added that
Asean (which is made up of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore,
Brunei and Malaysia) must work out an arrangement similar to that of the
European Union.
He said that, despite problems in Europe, 80 per cent of all trade by
European nations is within the continent. Regional trade within Asean
accounts for only 15 per cent, he said.

Rising inflows of foreign capital are increasing pressures on the Czech
authorities to speed moves to make the crown fully convertible, reports
Patrick Blum in Vienna.
Provisional estimates put capital inflows in the Czech Republic at Dollars
1.4bn (Pounds 939m) last year, more than the Dollars 1.2bn recorded in 1992
for Czechoslovakia. Of last year's total, about Dollars 600m was in direct
investment and about Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m in portfolio investment, with
the rest in loans and credits.
The completion this year of the first round of voucher privatisation, with
shares in about 1,000 companies sold to the public, and the start of trading
on the Prague stock exchange in June, have encouraged foreign investment in
Czech stocks and securities.

FT  27 JAN 94 / France calls for Bosnian action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday called for Nato forces to take action to enforce UN
decisions in Bosnia.
President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said in a
joint statement that Nato had agreed at a summit in Brussels this month to
relieve UN troops in the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica and open Tuzla airport
for aid supplies.
'It is now time for this decision to be carried out, including, if
necessary, by using force,' they said.
The French statement said international efforts to end fighting in former
Yugoslavia had failed and none of the warring parties appeared ready to
reach a peace agreement.
The international community must press for a peace accord by calling on all
belligerents to make necessary concessions, the statement said.
At the same time, France has been examining ways of making the European
peace plan for Bosnia more acceptable to the Moslems and thus to the US,
while seeking Russian support to neutralise any hostile reaction from the
Serbs, the dominant group in the war in the former Yugoslav republic.
Faced with growing frustration and internal division over keeping the
largest contingent of UN troops in Bosnia, France has increased efforts to
find what an Elysee official described as 'a new cocktail of incentives and
threats'. The intention is to improve aid supplies as well as bringing the
warring parties back to the negotiating table in Geneva.
The French initiative, led by Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, who has
this week talked to several of his EU partners and the Americans and
Russians, appears aimed at getting the European Union to endorse
modifications in the peace plan when their foreign ministries' political
directors meet in Brussels next Monday.
A French foreign ministry official stressed yesterday that the existing
peace plan, offering Moslems 33 per cent of Bosnian territory, Croats 17 per
cent and Serbs 42 per cent, was 'not untouchable'.
Adapting the plan to favour the Moslems a bit more might not involve
increasing their overall share of Bosnian territory, but might allow them to
consolidate their holdings into a more manageable whole while ensuring them
access to the Sava river in the north and the Adriatic in the south.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Unicef criticises the high human costs of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic and social reforms in central and eastern Europe have proved far
more costly in human terms than originally anticipated, with a massive rise
in poverty and widespread social disintegration, the United Nations
Children's Fund says in a report* published yesterday.
Presenting the report in Geneva, Mr James Grant, Unicef's executive
director, said immediate action was needed to minimise and compensate for
the human cost of reform measures. While reforms were necessary,
policy-makers had focused almost exclusively on economic issues, to the
detriment of social concerns, he said.
He also criticised bilateral aid programmes for the region which he said
were all too often driven by short-term commercial interests rather than the
needs of the receiving country.
The report, which documents the impact of the economic slump on living
conditions in nine countries since 1989, points out that, while all have
suffered the negative effects of reforms, the crisis is most pronounced in
eastern and south-eastern Europe. There, the spread of poverty, surging
death rates, plunging birth rates, falling school enrolment and an
unstoppable crime wave have reached 'truly alarming proportions'.
'These costs are not only the cause of unnecessary suffering and waste of
human lives, but also represent a source of considerable instability and
social conflict that could threaten the entire reform process,' Unicef
argues. Crude death rates (for the population as a whole) were up 9 per cent
in Romania, 12 per cent in Bulgaria and 32 per cent in Russia. Between 1989
and 1993, the yearly number of deaths in Russia rose by more than 500,000.

<TEXT>
Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, has delivered on his promise to
accelerate tax reform and give a boost to domestic demand in his 1994 budget
unveiled yesterday.
Hailed in advance as a 'budget for jobs', Mr Ahern has focused his new
measures on easing the tax burden for the lower paid, by a substantial
widening of the standard rate tax band, eliminating a 1 per cent income
levy, reducing employers' and employees' national insurance contributions
and increasing personal income tax allowances.
The effect of these reliefs will be to increase disposable income at the
lower end of the income scale by IPounds 333m (Dollars 478m) in a full tax
year, equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GNP. Overall private sector consumption
is estimated to grow by 4 per cent in 1994. This should boost consumer and
business confidence, especially in those industries manufacturing mainly for
the domestic market and which have experienced the heaviest job losses over
the past three years.
Although the Irish economy has one of the best performing economies in the
EU, exhibiting growth averaging 5 per cent since 1987, a low fiscal deficit
and low inflation, these successes have not stemmed the rising tide of
unemployment, which now stands at 18.4 per cent of the workforce - almost
twice the EC average. This budget, although unlikely to make a dramatic
impact on the jobless figure, should nonetheless help to reverse the trend
without fuelling inflationary fears.
Mr Ahern said the budget is aimed at creating 'faster sustainable economic
and employment growth' which would keep government borrowing 'comfortably
below 3 per cent of GNP'.
Inflation is 'unlikely to exceed 2.5 per cent' in 1994, compared to 1.5 per
cent in 1993, he said.
GNP growth in 1994 is projected at 3.75 per cent. He said capital spending
is set to grow by 7.3 per cent, while construction-related spending is
budgeted to grow by 9 per cent.
Mr Ahern has partially offset the expansionary effects of the budget, by
increasing excise duties on beer, tobacco and spirits, and shifting some of
the tax burden to middle and higher income groups, and reducing a range of
discretionary tax reliefs.
Property taxes are also to increase. The net effect of the measures will
result in a cost to the exchequer of IPounds 162m.
Government borrowing is targeted at IPounds 798m in 1994, or 2.7 per cent of
GNP, only 0.2 percentage points higher than in 1993.
Any public-sector pay increases for 1994, which have still to be finalised,
have already been built into that figure.
This will be reassuring news for the financial markets looking out for signs
of any slackening of fiscal discipline.
Opposition leaders, however, were critical of Mr Ahern for not going further
with tax reforms. Mr Ivan Yates, the spokesman for the Fine Gael party,
described the budget as 'modest, conservative and unimaginative'. The
government's own projections are for unemployment to fall only 5,000 to
289,000.

FT  27 JAN 94 / German inflation fall renews rate cut calls
</HEADLINE>

The annual inflation rate in Germany fell to 3.4 per cent in the month to
mid-January, in spite of new year increases in fuel and vehicle taxes,
pensions and insurance contributions, according to provisional figures from
the federal statistics office.
The rate compares with 3.7 per cent in the previous month, and was lower
than expected by most economists.
While the latest figure was welcomed as 'good news' for the German
Bundesbank, few analysts expect that it will be enough to justify a cut in
short-term interest rates at next Thursday's central bank meeting.
It does suggest, however, that Germany is in line for an average inflation
rate of below 3 per cent for 1994 as a whole, as forecast by the
government's annual economic report, published yesterday.
Confirmation of the rest of the government's forecasts, including a growth
rate for gross domestic product of between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent, brought a
sceptical response from both German industry, and the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD).
Only on its gloomy outlook for unemployment, suggesting an increase of up to
450,000 in the number of jobless, to around 3.9m, a national rate of around
10 per cent, is there general agreement.
The government figures were presented by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics
minister, who insisted that they were sober and realistic. He said that
although the latest increase in fuel prices and insurance payments might
cause a temporary setback in the first quarter, the west German economy had
clearly begun to recover from last year's sharp downturn.
The German federation of industry said it would be 'delighted' if the
government's forecast proved correct, but insisted that there was still no
evidence to confirm it. The BDI said that with the exception of exports, all
the main components in economic demand - private consumption, state
consumption and private and public investments - were less favourable in its
own calculations.
Mr Uwe Jens, the economics spokesman for the SPD, called for rapid and clear
moves by the Bundesbank to reduce its lead interest rates.
However, recent speeches and statements by top bank officials have made it
clear that further interest rate cuts depend mostly on further moderation in
money supply. The bank sees the broad M3 measure of monetary growth, which
expanded above target last year, as an early warning system for future
inflation.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank vice-president, said on Tuesday:
'We will make further interest rate reductions when the data - especially
money supply - develop according to our targets.'
December M3 figures, due next week, are expected to be well above the 6.5
per cent upper target limit for 1993, due to 'distortions by special
factors', according to Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the bank directorate.
But in an interview with the Borsen-Zeitung newspaper, he held out the
prospect of a marked improvement in the January figures.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Liberal leader of Belarus ousted by his parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Soviet-era conservative parliament of Belarus yesterday ousted the
country's liberal leader, Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, and appeared to end any
hope of rapid economic reforms and a neutral foreign policy, agencies
report.
Deputies voted 209 to 36 to dismiss Mr Shushkevich, 59, as chairman of
parliament. In his position he had waged virtually a single-handed
ideological battle against reluctant converts to market economics in
parliament and government. The country's conservative prime minister, Mr
Vyacheslav Kebich, and Mr Shushkevich's constant rival, survived a similar
vote to oust him. A total of 101 voted for his dismissal and 175 against.
The formal motion accused both men of corruption.
However, deputies made it plain that the vote was intended to censure Mr
Shushkevich's support for market reforms and resistance to aligning foreign
policy with neighbouring Russia.
'This is approval for the government's policy. Mr Shushkevich is an
idealist,' said Mr Kebich's senior adviser, Mr Valery Skorynin.
'You cannot reform and privatise any more quickly than our government has
been doing,' he added.
Mr Shushkevich's first deputy, Mr Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, a government
official in the Soviet era, took over as acting chairman of parliament.
Liberals, a small minority in parliament, said the vote portended the end of
Belarus as an entity separate from Russia in the post-Soviet era.
'Belarus's new pro-Russian leadership will conduct its affairs in such a way
as to bring the country into the Russian empire,' said Mr Zenon Poznyak,
leader of the Belarus Popular Front. 'This is a betrayal of Belarus
sovereignty.'
Some moderates said Mr Kebich was still morally obliged to resign after more
than 100 deputies voted against him.
Mr Shushkevich, backed by President Bill Clinton during his tour of the
former Soviet Union two weeks ago, came under fierce attack from opponents
in the debate leading up to the vote.
Some said he had failed as a statesman, others denounced him for helping
dismantle communist power, as a co-signatory of the 1991 accord declaring
the Soviet Union defunct.
In contrast to neighbouring Ukraine, Belarus did not seek independence as
the Soviet Union disintegrated and its politics remain dominated by
communists.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Brussels holds up state aid to Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday called on the French government to freeze
a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) capital injection for Bull, the loss-making
computer group, or face action in the European Court of Justice.
The French government and Bull's management expressed their determination to
restructure and privatise the computer group. Bull said that a
rationalisation plan, aimed at returning the group to 'financial health' was
being finalised and would be presented to the Commission. Once it has
received official notice of the Commission's decision, the French government
will have 30 days to present the plan.
The Commission's inquiry into Bull was triggered by a payment of FFr2.5bn to
the company in February last year by the previous French government. But
Brussels yesterday extended the inquiry to include pledges of capital
totalling FFr8.6bn from the government and France Telecom, the state-owned
telecommunications group, made at the end of last year. It is the final
FFr2.5bn tranche of that capital injection which the Commission wants
suspended.
The Commission said that information received last December from the French
government, following the announcement of the new capital increase, was
'composed of a series of declarations of intent and of goals which do not
constitute a restructuring plan'.
French officials argue that Bull needs time and the capital injections to
restructure. 'My feeling is that the blocking of the FFr2.5bn would prevent
progress at the company and I ask for the same treatment as obtained by
Ekostahl in Germany and the Italian steel industry,' said Mr Gerard Longuet,
industry minister, in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French
business daily.
'Bull is like a liner, not a bicycle and therefore the negotiation of bends
takes a bit longer than one would hope,' said Mr Longuet. Bull said that its
recovery plan, which involves cost cutting and a reorganisation of
management is already bringing improvement and that sales are also
stabilising.
Separately, the Commission has opened an investigation into subsidies
granted by the city-state of Bremen in Germany to the Klockner steel-mill.
The Commission says most of a DM250m cash injection to the company will come
from public funds, because state holding companies are part of a consortium
planning to buy the mill.

FT  27 JAN 94 / EU helps Russian banks: Funds target 'major defects' in
financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has approved a Ecu2m (Pounds 1.6m) scheme to help to
remove 'major defects' in the banking system in the former Soviet Union.
The defects include 'a worrying lack of transparency' in the net position of
credits and liabilities between banks, and between banks and customers. This
lack of transparency could point to hidden insolvency problems, the European
Commission said yesterday.
The Ecu2m contract will fund the dispatch of experts to the Russian central
bank, and help to modernise their payment and clearing systems. A portion
will also go to the new Inter State Bank set up to improve inter-state
payments, as well as to the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus.
EU officials said a more efficient payments system should help to reverse
the collapse of inter-state trade.
The Commission money belongs to the TACIS aid programme to eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. The contractor is a Spanish-British consortium
led by the SEMA group of Spain.
The Commission said that aid to the central bank of Belarus would
'naturally' take account of the recent agreement with Russia on monetary
unification.
Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, called yesterday for more aid to
the former communist countries of eastern Europe, including the former
Soviet Union.
The EU, US and other donors should ensure that efforts do not fall short of
what is needed. Other Commission officials indicated that future aid is
likely to be tied even more closely to the pace of reform, with backsliders
likely to receive net reductions in assistance.

FT  27 JAN 94 / EU car sales rules attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European consumers' group yesterday called for an end to the system of
exclusive distribution networks for EU car sales, writes John Griffiths.
The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs claimed the system, which is
exempt from normal EU competition rules, has worked against consumers'
interests while providing virtually none of the benefits claimed by Europe's
motor industry.
BEUC's denunciation came less than 24 hours after the industry commissioner,
Mr Martin Bangemann, had suggested the 10-year 'block exemption' from
competition rules could be extended after it expires in 1995.
BEUC's director, Mr Jim Murray, claimed the exemption had been 'an
unmitigated disaster' for consumers. It had restricted competition, denying
consumers freedom to buy competitively priced cars throughout the EU.

FT  27 JAN 94 / State power company to offer 20 per cent of capital to
public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The company which runs Russia's electricity grid and owns part or all of
various power plants said yesterday it would offer 20 per cent of its
capital to the public, as part of the country's mass privatisation campaign,
writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
The decision appears to be an attempt to satisfy the government's need to
make shares available to the public free of charge, in exchange for their
privatisation vouchers. The sale is unlikely to change the way the company,
United Energy System, is run. The government will keep 51 per cent and will
continue to control electricity prices.
Mr Anatoly Dyakov, the chairman, denied the company was a 'monopolistic
monster', although his deputy said the share sale's attractiveness lay in
the fact that the state retained control of prices.
Mr Dyakov admitted that consumers, particularly industrial users, owed
Rbs2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in unpaid bills.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Van Miert equal to the competition despite defeat: Andrew
Hill examines the policy significance of the go-ahead given to a
controversial steel-tube joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's decision yesterday not to block a three-way joint
venture between French, German and Italian steel-tube manufacturers is a
small blow to the pride of Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner.
It is the Belgian socialist's first defeat on a proposal to the Commission
since he took over the job from the UK's Sir Leon Brittan a year ago.
The setback has again raised the question among competition policy purists
of whether Mr Van Miert is fighting his corner as fiercely as Sir Leon used
to.
Mr Van Miert did back his officials' case against the steel-tube venture -
based on the supposition that it would have created an anti-competitive
'duopoly' in the EU market - although he was said to have had some initial
doubts about the argument. However, as one respected Brussels competition
lawyer put it yesterday: 'I think he's basically conscientious and balanced,
but Leon Brittan would have been able to get it through.'
Evidence from the same Commission meeting and Mr Van Miert's 12 months in
the job suggests that such an analysis is too harsh. Yesterday,
commissioners also approved, without discussion, a tough line towards French
government subsidies to Bull, the computer group, and endorsed Mr Van
Miert's move to open an investigation into aid for the Klockner steel mill
in the German state of Bremen.
Indeed, Mr Van Miert seems to be proving more than equal to tackling state
subsidies - the area he has identified as his greatest challenge when he
took over the job.
He set the tone at a conference organised by French public-sector companies
a year ago: directors of France's largest utilities heaped praise on 'Mon
cher Karel' and addressed him informally as 'tu'; Mr Van Miert chose to
address them throughout with the polite French 'vous'.
Since then, he has shown particular grit in persuading governments to agree
unanimously to subsidy cuts in the sensitive steel sector, although he
admits the December decision was an unsatisfactory compromise. Moreover,
observers believe Mr Van Miert's style - more emollient and less
confrontational than Sir Leon's - probably helped persuade suspicious fellow
commissioners to agree controversial plans last year for further
liberalisation of the telecommunications sector.
Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, who has headed the Commission's competition
policy directorate under Sir Leon and Mr Van Miert, says such liberalisation
programmes will reinforce the importance of his department's policy over the
next few years. In particular, the internal market and the Commission's
plans for trans-European networks - large infrastructure projects in
telecoms, information technology, energy and transport sectors - would be
undermined if Brussels abandoned a strong competition policy. 'The existence
of trans-European networks presupposes that the goods which are transported
on them circulate freely,' he points out.
Certainly, competition policy remains the staple dish on the commissioners'
weekly menu of decisions.
Even when new legislative proposals are thin on the ground - as has been the
case over the past two years - the volume of competition decisions rarely
flags. For example, under Mr Van Miert the Commission last year took 58
merger decisions, compared with 60 the previous year under Sir Leon. Some
435 state aid cases were decided, against 502 in 1992, with roughly the same
proportion of positive and negative decisions under both regimes.
In fact, the same questions are raised by competition specialists now, as
used to be raised when Sir Leon Brittan was in charge of the dossier.
Brussels-based competition lawyers agree that yesterday's steel-tubes
decision is a setback for officials in the Commission's merger task force.
Had the joint venture been blocked it would have been only the second deal
to be outlawed in the three-year history of the EU's merger regulation. It
would also have established an important legal precedent, by allowing the
Commission to take potential duopolies into account when examining the
implications of mergers and joint ventures, even when the companies involved
had no structural links.
But for Mr Van Miert, the decision amounts simply to further evidence that
even the best-argued recommendation on competition policy is still subject
to the vagaries of a political decision by 17 commissioners.
In that respect, nothing has changed since the days of Sir Leon, and, as
lawyers point out, nothing will change unless Brussels decides to take the
great leap towards the establishment of an independent European competition
authority.

FT  27 JAN 94 / French fashions show first deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French fashion industry, traditionally one of the most prestigious
elements of Gallic commerce, last year recorded its first trading deficit.
France's women's wear manufacturers saw the balance of trading swing from a
surplus of FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) in 1992 to a FFr321m deficit in 1993
according to figures from the Federation Francaise de la Pret-a-porter.
Every area of the industry has been affected, from mass-market manufacturers
to France's exclusive fashion houses, which face fierce competition from
Italian rivals and the increasingly influential young Belgian designers.
The chief problem for French fashion was the downturn in demand from its
main European markets, notably Germany where sales of French women's wear
fell by a third. Sales were affected by the gloomy economic environment and
by the franc's strength against other European currencies, which made it
more difficult for the French to compete against the Italians.
The extent of the fall in sales to Europe was magnified by changes in the
European Commission's method of compiling statistics, but these changes
simply exaggerated the underlying negative trend.
French fashion did benefit last year from an increase in exports to the
fast-growing Asian economies, such as South Korea and Taiwan.
Business was little better on the home front. Sales of French women's wear
fell by 1.7 per cent last year in France itself. The only areas of the
market to show growth were hypermarkets and mail order catalogues, which
specialise in selling cut-price fashions.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Unicef criticises economic reform's high human cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic and social reforms in central and eastern Europe have proved far
more costly in human terms than originally anticipated, with a massive rise
in poverty and widespread social disintegration, the United Nations
Children's Fund says in a report* published yesterday.
Presenting the report in Geneva, Mr James Grant, Unicef's executive
director, said immediate action was needed to minimise and compensate for
the human cost of reform measures. While reforms were necessary,
policymakers had focused almost exclusively on economic issues to the
detriment of social concerns, he said.
He also criticised bilateral aid programmes for the region which he said
were all too often driven by short-term commercial interests rather than the
needs of the receiving country.
The report, which documents the impact of the economic slump on living
conditions in nine countries since 1989, points out that while all have
suffered the negative effects of reforms the crisis is most pronounced in
eastern and south-eastern Europe. There, the spread of poverty, surging
death rates, plunging birth rates, falling school enrolment and an
unstoppable crime wave have reached 'truly alarming proportions'.
'These costs are not only the cause of unnecessary suffering and waste of
human lives but also represent a source of considerable instability and
social conflict that could threaten the entire reform process,' Unicef
argues. Crude death rates (for the population as a whole) were up 9 per cent
in Romania, 12 per cent in Bulgaria and 32 per cent in Russia. Between 1989
and 1993 the yearly number of deaths in Russia rose by more than 500,000.
Mr Giovanni Andrea Cornia, principal author of the report, said the increase
was partly due to the spread of infectious diseases such as diphtheria and
tuberculosis as immunisation programmes lapsed. There has also been a
serious rise in deaths from accidents, poisonings and murder. In Poland the
number of suicides rose by one-third between 1989 and 1992.
Unicef notes that, although there are some signs of recovery in certain
areas, only the Czech Republic appears to be slowly returning to normal. In
Romania, Russia, Ukraine and, to some extent, Bulgaria the crisis is
deepening.

FT  27 JAN 94 / French try again for Bosnia peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France is examining ways of making the European peace plan for Bosnia more
acceptable to the Moslems and thus to the US, while seeking Russian support
to neutralise any hostile reaction from the Serbs, the dominant group in the
war in the former Yugoslav republic.
Faced with growing frustration and internal division over keeping the
largest contingent of United Nations troops in Bosnia, France has increased
efforts to find what an Elysee official described as 'a new cocktail of
incentives and threats'. The intention is to improve aid supplies as well as
bringing the warring parties back to the negotiating table in Geneva.
The French initiative, led by Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, who has
this week talked to several of his EU partners and the Americans and
Russians, appears aimed at getting the European Union to endorse
modifications in the peace plan when their foreign ministries' political
directors meet in Brussels next Monday.
A French foreign ministry official stressed yesterday that the existing
peace plan, offering Moslems 33 per cent of Bosnian territory, Croats 17 per
cent and Serbs 42 per cent, was 'not untouchable'.
Adapting the plan to favour the Moslems a bit more might not involve
increasing their overall share of Bosnian territory, but might allow them to
consolidate their holdings into a more manageable whole while ensuring them
access to the Sava river in the north and the Adriatic in the south.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday confirmed that no
decision had been taken yet on the withdrawal of British troops from Bosnia
and that the British government would 'not act hastily or alone.'
Though Mr Hurd, who visited British troops with the United Nations
Protection Force in Bosnia last week, said the outlook for peace remained
bleak, he emphasised that the UK was committed to maintaining its military
contribution throughout the winter and to improving its effectiveness.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Peps help boost unit trust sales to record Pounds 9.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record Pounds 9.1bn was poured into unit trusts last year against a
background of sharply rising UK share prices.
With base rates at their lowest for 16 years, many private investors have
been turning away from building societies to unit trusts, sales of which
jumped from only Pounds 648.9m in 1992.
Private investors accounted for Pounds 5bn of the total sales, with demand
fuelled by personal equity plans, offering tax-free returns. More than 60
per cent of the sales to private investors were through Peps.
The record unit trust sales had been achieved by the end of September 1993,
when the figure reached Pounds 6.91bn, topping the previous high of Pounds
6.33bn for 1987.
Base rates have fallen from 15 per cent in 1989 to 5.5 per cent. However,
the steepest falls followed Britain's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992. Since then, base rates have been in single
figures and private savers have been searching for new homes for their
money.
Many unit trusts - pooled investment funds - offer returns equal to, or
greater than, the income from building society accounts.
'The recession has not been about people having no money but about having
money and not spending it,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Warburg
Securities. 'People have been paying off their mortgage and, with deposit
rates so low, unit trusts and personal equity plans have been a powerful
combination.'
Building societies, which reaped the benefits of high interest rates in the
late 1980s, have had to fight for private investors' money against
competition from National Savings and equity-based products. Last year, they
recorded a net inflow of Pounds 2.2bn - a significant advance on the very
weak 1992 figure of Pounds 295m - but lower than the Pounds 6.6bn and Pounds
5.8bn received in 1990 and 1991 respectively. That compares with net sales
of Pounds 391.6m and Pounds 2.8bn for unit trusts in 1990 and 1991.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said that while some of the money leaving building societies was undoubtedly
finding its way into unit trusts, he was concerned that the last time unit
trusts had had their greatest inflow was just before the stock market crash
of 1987.
'I am not sure just how long the steep rise in the market will continue,' he
said. The FT-A All-Share, which measures the performance of the UK's 800
leading quoted companies, has risen by more than 23 per cent since the
beginning of 1992.
However, Mr Paul Walton, UK investment strategist at stockbrokers James
Capel, said: 'Individuals are making provision for the longer term. It is
fear - rather than greed - that they might not be provided for in the
future.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / Major starts drive to reassert his political authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will tomorrow attempt to relaunch the government's troubled
'back to basics' initiative in a speech which was being interpreted last
night as the start of a concerted push to rebuild his political authority.
The prime minister will use a visit to the north of England to set out his
'prospectus for 1994' amid mounting pressure for him to regain a grip on the
government after a month of turmoil.
Downing Street said last night that Mr Major would use the speech to explain
his policy priorities for the rest of the year.
Meanwhile, senior Conservatives disputed a claim by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, that Labour had not made any public spending commitments.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dismissed government allegations about
Labour's spending plans as 'bogus rubbish'. However, he warned the shadow
cabinet not to give the Conservatives ammunition by making irresponsible
promises.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, faced criticism from some rightwing Tory MPs
for his apparent failure to react quickly enough to Labour's attack on the
government's planned tax increases.
His deputy at the Treasury, Mr Michael Portillo, was being attacked from the
party left for seeking to raise his own profile ahead of any challenge to Mr
Major's leadership.
Rightwing MPs were speculating about the possible candidacies of Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, if Mr Major is threatened.
Yesterday's exchanges on Labour's spending pledges came after Mr Brown had
said in a morning radio interview that the party had 'no commitment to spend
money on anything'.
Mr Portillo accused Mr Brown of 'stepping on the garden rake', saying his
'rash campaign against his colleagues' showed he realised that 'if you
promise to spend more you will have to tax more'.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, said that by making tax the
'main political issue', Labour had scored 'a significant own goal'.
Labour responded to signs the government was backing away from a
confrontation over pay with the main groups of public-sector workers by
urging an end to secrecy over such pay awards.
Downing Street insisted independent pay review body recommendations for
rises this year of up to 3 per cent would not necessarily cause problems for
the government, which has imposed a cash freeze on its pay bill.

FT  27 JAN 94 / O'Reilly submits Pounds 30m bid for stake in Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman and newspaper publisher, last night
increased the stakes in the increasingly bitter battle for the future of The
Independent newspaper by submitting a formal offer for up to 29.9 per cent
of the company.
The offer, worth in the region of Pounds 30m, has been assembled by
Charterhouse merchant bank and will be the only formal offer on the table
when the board of Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent, meets
today.
It is clear that the lossmaking Newspaper Publishing, which is in need of a
cash injection, could have a cheque for between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m by
Friday, depending on the precise shareholding involved.
A consortium, including Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Andreas Whittam
Smith, main founder of The Independent, which announced on Monday that it
intended to bid for the company, has not yet agreed a price and no formal
bid is expected before next week
The consortium, whose other members include existing Independent
shareholders El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, is talking about
an offer in the region of Pounds 2 a share. This would value Newspaper
Publishing at around Pounds 40m. The proposed price would take into account
the injection of around Pounds 20m into the company to pay off debt of
around Pounds 5m and provide working capital and money to promote both The
Independent and The Independent on Sunday.
Mr O'Reilly, the chief executive of HJ Heinz, the international food
company, is chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland and a substantial
shareholder.
The offer may only be the opening shot in the battle. The O'Reilly camp has
made clear it is prepared to make a full bid for the paper. It is believed
the Dublin company has been approached by a large UK group not in the
newspaper business.
Mr Giles Elliott, of Schroders, the merchant bank which represents El Pais
and La Repubblica, said yesterday his clients would vote against an O'Reilly
offer.
MGN, which would under its proposal take a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper
Publishing, would offer help on everything from printing and distribution to
general management.
The journalists at The Independent have rejected the proposals of the
consortium mainly because of the involvement of MGN and its chief executive,
Mr David Montgomery.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Pressure on Hurd over Malaysia dam deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was under increasing pressure to disclose more about its
controversial donation of aid to Malaysia in the late 1980s after a powerful
House of Commons committee decided to launch a new investigation yesterday.
The all-party select committee on foreign affairs said it would investigate
the Thatcher government's decision to give Malaysia Pounds 234m to build a
hydroelectric dam on the Pergau river. The decision was opposed by a top
Whitehall official.
The committee's announcement came as ministers disclosed for the first time
that the offer of aid had been linked to sales of Pounds 1bn of defence
equipment to the Malaysian government. Labour MPs said last night such a
linkage might be illegal.
There were also growing signs that Britain's aid contribution had been used
on other construction contracts, including 12 hospitals.
In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
said there had been a link between the general offer of aid to Malaysia and
the signing of a Pounds 1bn arms deal.
He said that on a visit to Kuala Lumpur in 1988, Lord Youngerof Prestwick -
then Mr George Younger, defence secretary, had signed a protocol in which
the Malaysian government had set out its intention to buy defence equipment
from the UK.
According to Mr Hurd: 'The protocol included a reference to 'aid in support
of non-military aspects under this programme'.'
Mr Hurd emphasised that 'after consultation with ministerial colleagues in
London' the link was later officially denied. Lord Younger wrote to the
Malaysian minister of finance in June that year to say that aid could not be
linked to defence sales.
'As a result, the issue was not taken up in the memorandum of understanding
on defence procurement which the British and Malaysian PMs signed in
September 1988,' Mr Hurd said.
However, Mr Hurd's comments run counter to Lord Younger's recent claims that
there had only been a 'verbal' linkage of arms and aid. It is also
understood that Mrs Thatcher was forced to write a toughly worded memorandum
to ministers, outlining her concern that the aid deal should not be linked
to arms sales. The foreign affairs committee should be able to summon Mr
Hurd to its hearings to answer questions. Foreign Office officials said
committee members might be allowed to see the documents relating to the
case.
However, the officials thought that any link of overseas aid with defence
contracts would not be technically illegal.
The unusual nature of the Pergau deal was further underlined last night when
the government admitted it was the only project over which Mr Hurd had
intervened with Overseas Development Administration officials while foreign
secretary.
Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, foreign office minister, said in a parliamentary
written answer that Mr Hurd had 'given a ministerial direction to ODA's
accounting officer on one occasion, in respect of the Pergau hydro-electric
project in Malaysia'.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Ariane seeks to reassure insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arianespace, the Paris-based manufacturer of the Ariane rocket, yesterday
launched an investigation into the failure of its 63rd mission - which
ditched Turkish and European telecommunications satellites insured for
Dollars 350m into the Atlantic Ocean on Monday.
In Kourou, French Guiana - the company's South American launchpad - and
Paris, officials sought to reassure clients and insurers that the programme
of ten launches in 1994 would not be affected by the disaster.
'We hope insurers will continue to invest their confidence in the Ariane
system,' an official declared. The inquiry, which will be conducted together
with the European Space Agency and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales,
will report next month.
It was the sixth failure for the rocket, which controls over half the
commercial space launch market, since its first lift-off in 1979. It emerged
yesterday that a premature shut-down of an engine followed by overheating in
the unmanned Ariane-4 rocket caused the failure 13 minutes after launch. It
was the first failure for four years and industry participants denied that
the crash marked a turning-point in Arianespace's fortunes.
Although the high-risk commercial launch market has become highly
competitive, the French-led consortium has retained its grip in spite of
looming Russian, Japanese and Chinese rivalry and American competition. In
the US, three out of eight launches of General Dynamics' Atlas rocket failed
last year, while McDonnell-Douglas' Delta rocket has been overtaken by the
move towards heavier satellites.

FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh speculation erupted over the future of Boots' pharmaceutical division,
prompted this time by a press report, and the shares were actively traded. A
feeling among some brokers - UBS and Panmure Gordon among them - that the
shares were looking oversold from recent weak sessions also contributed to a
rise for the stock, which touched 567p before closing 1 1/2 up at 563p.
Turnover was a busy 3.7m.
Boots denied that it was planning to sell its drugs arm. Speculation over
such a move has been rife since the company's well-publicised and costly
abandonment of its Manoplax heart drug last summer. However, analysts remain
convinced that a restructuring at Boots will lead to the sale of the
prescription drugs business, while leaving the over the counter medicine
division intact.
Pearson, the media conglomerate and owner of the Financial Times, rose 11 to
655p against the market as word leaked out that agency broker Henderson
Crosthwaite was preparing a strong buy recommendation on the stock. Turnover
of 7.2m was one of the highest on record. The house is believed to be citing
the stock's underperformance against the market last year and improved
performance at satellite broadcaster BSkyB, in which Pearson owns almost 18
per cent.
Reuters Holdings remained strong ahead of figures due on February 8. Buying
from the US lay behind a rise in London of 28 to 1933p.
Some leading pharmaceutical shares were influenced by a research document
from Credit Lyonnais Laing which recommended Zeneca, SmithKline Beecham,
Wellcome and Medeva. But the sector trickled back later, with
internationally traded stocks led down by selling in the US. Zeneca lost 2
to 808p, SmithKline 4 to 428p and Wellcome 12 to 670p. Medeva held at 168p,
Glaxo shed 6 1/2 to 654 1/2 p as dealers noted that US investors had
continued to sell the stock. The US holding fell to 18.55 per cent of the
total, from 19.8 per cent just before Christmas.
Fisons firmed 2 to 140p after the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific
instruments group announced a Pounds 35m savings plan and analysts raised
1995 and 1996 forecasts.
The savings figure is Pounds 10m more than Fisons announced as a target last
month, and Mr Ian Smith of Lehman Brothers adjusted his forecast of 1995
profits to around Pounds 170m, against Pounds 164m previously.
Bank shares succumbed to the market-wide selling pressure, with the Hong
Kong-influenced stocks affected by the decline in the Hang Seng index and
strong rumours that the Hong Kong market may tumble again this morning.
HSBC dropped 24 to 954p and Standard Chartered 35 to 1310p. Lloyds Bank, the
first of the big four to report preliminary results, suffered from a bout of
determined profit-taking and fell 19 to 637p.
Sun Alliance (5.2m traded) and Royal Insurance (5.6m) were the big turnover
stocks in a composite insurance sector hit by strong profit-taking. Royal
settled 11 off at 330p in spite of some low key but ever present support
from influential marketmakers, while Sun slipped 4 to 400p.
GEC, sustained by a Hoare Govett buy note giving the stock a target price of
370p, managed a minor improvement at 336 1/2 p.
Costain, still boosted by stories that Hanson, among others, is about to bid
for the company's US coal interests, rose 3 to 38 1/2 p as turnover in the
shares rocketed to 14m.
Better than expected results that were accompanied by an upbeat analysts
meeting pushed conglomerate Lonrho up 8 to 153p in strong trading of 13m
shares.
Overseas buying continued in British Steel, once again leading to hefty
turnover of 31m, as the shares eased with the market to finish a penny
lighter at 131 1/2 p.
TI Group slipped 8 to 421p after UBS downgraded its recommendation on the
stock from a buy to a hold. It was 'take profits' advice from SG Warburg
that left GKN trailing 6 at 596p.
Lucas Industries put on 2 at 214p. The stock is one of a basket of seven
engineering shares on which Morgan Stanley, the US investment house, has
issued a two-year call warrant. The warrant was issued at 18.08p.
Public relations group Shandwick rose 2 to 35 1/2 p on announcing that it
was back in the black with a full-year profit of Pounds 4.8m, against a
previous loss of Pounds 2.5m.
Among food manufacturers, Booker, off 18 at 455p, and Hazlewood, down 2 at
167 1/2 p, suffered from 'take profits' advice from Strauss Turnbull, which
recommended Northern Foods, 3 ahead at 261p. Cadbury-Schweppes, up 15 at one
stage, had its progress checked by a negative note from Salomon Brothers and
closed unchanged at 531p.
Burton Group eased 2 3/4 to 68 1/2 p on nervousness ahead of results
expected tomorrow.
Talk of a beer price war in the retail trade rumbled on for a second day and
cast further gloom on the big domestic brewers. Bass retreated 11 to 579p,
Whitbread 'A' 10 to 604p, Allied-Lyons 9 to 650p and Grand Metropolitan 11
to 469p.

plans restructuring programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zellweger Uster, the Swiss textile machinery manufacturer, said it fell into
loss last year because of the severe recession in the world textile
industry.
The group, whose earnings have been depressed since 1989, announced a SFr45m
(Dollars 31m) restructuring programme, with some 200 redundancies expected
in the spinning division in the first half of this year.
Zellweger Uster said that the restructuring charges would expand the final
deficit for 1993 to about SFr55m, compared with net income in 1992 of SFr2m.
Consolidated sales last year reached SFr990.8m. The traditional divisions
contributed flat sales of SFr743.3m while Luwa, an associated textile
machinery company acquired fully last July, added SFr247.5m.
Orders were down in all important markets except the US and margins were
under heavy pressure.
At the pre-tax level, the loss was some SFr5m compared with a profit of
SFr19.9m in 1992.
The group, in which the Bechtler family-owned Hesta has a majority stake,
said that it was aiming to reach break-even point this year, but the results
of a cost cutting programme would take full effect in 1995.
Zellweger last paid a dividend on 1990 results, but said it expected to be
able to pay a dividend for 1995.
It also announced a plan to split its bearer and registered shares on the
basis of five for every one held and to offer holders of participation
certificates the opportunity to swap them into bearer shares.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Ahern weighs jobs against inflation perils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The test for Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, as he presents his
1994 budget today is to halt the rise in unemployment without stoking
inflation and currency instability. At 18.4 per cent, unemployment is
Ireland's most pressing economic problem.
Mr Ahern is in the happy position of facing the year ahead with buoyant tax
revenues, historically low interest rates, accelerating growth at home,
economic recovery in Ireland's main overseas markets, low inflation (1.5 per
cent in 1993) and an opening fiscal deficit of only 2.1 per cent of GNP, one
of the lowest in the OECD. Labour ministers in the Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition, have been champing at the bit to take a more expansionist
approach to economic policy and have heralded the package as a budget for
jobs.
Mr Ahern has echoed concern on jobs but has tried to damp expectations of a
'give-away' budget. Fiscal discipline will continue to be the overriding
goal. 'I am determined to ensure that the progress we have made in the
public finances is not used as a base for paying ourselves more,' he said.
'Competitiveness' is the 'highest priority'.
His words are welcomed by the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation
(IBEC), but it is suspicious of Mr Ahern's tax and spending plans. IBEC
points out that the government has reduced the fiscal deficit in recent
years through tax increases rather than spending cuts.
Employers, trade unions and opposition leaders are united in pressing for
reductions in the tax burden on the lower paid, and on social insurance
contributions of both employers and employees. High taxation, especially at
the lower end of the pay scale, is widely viewed as a principal reason why
Ireland's good economic performance in recent years fuelled significant
growth in unemployment.
In framing this budget - Mr Ahern has about IPounds 200m (Dollars 286m), or
around 0.7 per cent of GNP, to play with to ease the tax burden - increased
economic activity leading to higher tax revenues will give the minister room
to cut some taxes without increasing the overall borrowing/GNP ratio. Most
likely to go will be a widely disliked 1 per cent income levy, introduced in
the last budget, and which has been the main stumbling block in drawing up a
new centralised pay agreement over the next three years. A widening of the
standard rate income tax band and a substantial increase in personal
allowances is also expected.
In addition Mr Ahern will have anticipated privatisation receipts of some
IPounds 115m from the sale of the government's 15.3 per cent stake in Irish
Life, the insurance group, and an estimated windfall of some IPounds 230m
accrued from a tax 'amnesty' which closed this month.
BCP brokers in Dublin say that in the past three years, the
capital-intensive export sector rather than domestic demand 'where there has
been a virtual stagnation' has provided the engine for growth in the
economy.
The challenge for Mr Ahern will be to stimulate domestic demand, but without
overheating the economy.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Public-sector wages strike brings disruption to Lisbon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 24-hour national strike by Portuguese public-sector workers yesterday
seriously disrupted hospitals, schools, courts, public transport and other
services. Unions said the action was backed by up to 90 per cent of workers
concerned.
The strike was in protest against a proposal by the centre-right social
democrat government to limit 1994 pay rises in the public administrative
sector to 2 per cent. Unions are demanding a 9 per cent increase. The strike
was the first to be jointly backed by both the communist-led
CGTP-Intersindical and socialist-dominated UGT union confederations.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, has made clear that his
government aims to set an example for private-sector employers by keeping
pay rises low. This follows the collapse of efforts to negotiate a national
wage pact between unions and employers.
Union leaders said yesterday they were prepared to call a jointly backed
one-day general strike if the government refused to negotiate a compromise
on pay. The government is concerned that a public-sector pay increase above
2 per cent would fuel inflation and increase the budget deficit, which is
forecast to fall from 8.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993 to 6
per cent this year. Public-sector unions claim that the government pay offer
represents a sharp cut in real earnings, given that the forecast inflation
rate for 1994 is 6 per cent.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Spain's private banks uneasy over Banesto rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS, JOHN GAPPER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition is growing among Spain's private banks to making a large
contribution to the rescue of Banco Espanol de Credito, despite efforts by
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor, to gain their support.
Mr Rojo met the chairmen of the top five private banks yesterday to present
them with proposals drawn up by Banesto's management on relaunching the bank
after intervention by the central bank a month ago.
The Spanish Banking Association said the latest estimate of the
overvaluation of Banesto's assets was Pta605bn (Dollars 4.23bn). That
compares with an estimate of Pta 675bn by a Banesto official last week.
Bankers said the private banks could be asked to contribute up to Pta200bn
to Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund. That would underwrite a capital increase,
although the equity might be floated.
Madrid bankers say the troubled bank will contribute to its own rescue by
allocating all its Pta245bn reserves into provisions and reducing the
nominal value of its shares from Pta700 to Pta500 to raise an extra Pta35bn.
Under the draft plan disclosed by the bank last week, Banesto's capital
increase would have been Pta120bn-Pta150bn and the acquisition of bad debts,
to be shared with the Bank of Spain, would have represented at most
Pta200bn.
The Bank of Spain report triggering its intervention put Banesto's gross
financing needs at Pta503bn. The latest Pta605bn figure is only an estimate.
The private banks believe that too much money is being set aside to refloat
Banesto, and that they are being required to carry an excessive burden of
the proposed outlay.
While the banks are prepared to help Banesto's restructuring, they are
unwilling to participate in a plan that might turn Banesto into a powerful
rival.
Mr Rojo is due to meet the heads of Spanish savings banks today to discuss
Banesto.
US regulators are to investigate the investment rules guiding credit unions
after US Central Credit Union, a Kansas-based institution acting as a sort
of central bank to other credit unions, placed Dollars 255m in an uninsured
Banesto certificate of deposit, writes George Graham in Washington.
Federal regulators said the first Dollars 10m was repaid to US Central last
week, with interest, and were confident there would be no loss on the
remainder.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Pre-strike rate cut bolsters Spanish markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Just two days before Spain's unions plan to bring the country to a
standstill in a 24-hour general strike, the Bank of Spain yesterday boosted
the stock market and the peseta with a quarter-point cut that brought the
benchmark intervention rate down to 8.75 per cent.
The move reflected confidence by the monetary authorities that domestic
recession has bottomed out, that headline inflation, which stood at 4.9 per
cent at the end of last month, will fall as low as 3.5 per cent in the
course of this year and that currency turmoil is unlikely in the coming
months.
The timing of the cut could, however, have been brought forward to undermine
tomorrow's union protest against the government's economic policies. The
chief issue in the national stoppage is the introduction of labour market
reforms that will make it easier to hire and fire workers in order to
increase competitiveness.
The Madrid Bolsa index rose to touch a high of 343.81 on news of the cut
before easing to close at 342.94, up 3.93 from Monday. Top retail banks
followed up the new intervention rate by announcing lower lending costs.
The peseta, which had been under pressure at the beginning of this year
after the rescue of Banesto, the big banking group, had by late afternoon
strengthened to Pta80.93 against the D-Mark against Monday's Pta81.61 fix
and had firmed by more than a peseta against the dollar to Pta141.90.
Analysts believe the benchmark rate will fall by about two points to around
7 per cent this year because of the favourable exchange rate and
inflationary trends, and the need to assist economic recovery.
But they had not expected the normally cautious Bank of Spain to introduce a
cut so soon and, much less so, before the planned general strike.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (15): Doing without a compromise
 -Docking stations and the alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile computing usually involves compromise. Either you sacrifice some of
the features of your desktop PC or you buy a large portable computer so
heavy that you need a Sherpa to carry it. Such computers are euphemistically
known as transportables - computer speak for hard to transport.
Not surprisingly, the market for transportables is dwindling. Market
researchers Dataquest say that in 1991 and 1992, 8,000 transportables were
sold a year in Europe compared with about 6,000 in 1993. Mr Christopher
Fell, associate director of Dataquest's European PC group, says that only a
few suppliers still make transportables (including IBM and Compaq) and the
machines are used mainly for very power-intensive scientific, technical or
financial applications which involve number-crunching or high-resolution
graphics.
Docking stations. Most users do not need this level of power when they are
on the move. But they do need extra features when they are in the office
(such as large screens or links to printers and networks). One solution
which involves very little compromise is to use a notebook computer in
conjunction with a 'docking station'. This looks like a central processing
unit for a standard desktop PC but contains a slot into which you insert
your portable.
Mr Lewis Schrock, PC group manager at Compaq UK, says: 'Using a docking
station is as easy as slotting a videocassette into a VCR. Slide in the
notebook and it works. There are no cables to connect.' The docking station
is plugged into the office power supply and computer network, so the
notebook becomes in effect a desktop PC.
Docking stations are available from most major PC suppliers including Apple,
IBM, Toshiba and Compaq. They have a number of advantages:
Convenience. Files do not have to be copied from portable to desktop machine
using disks (which may be of different sizes or densities) or communications
cables. They are stored on the notebook computer's hard disk and can be
accessed on the move or when the notebook is in the docking station.
Similarly, applications software such as word processing does not have to be
copied onto two PCs.
Features. Large colour displays and full-size keyboards can be permanently
attached to most docking stations (a few models restrict the user to the
notebook's own keyboard and screen). Docking stations also have built-in
expansion slots and extra ports to give easy access to the company network
and to peripherals such as a CD-ROM drive and a printer. And they can
provide extra storage.
Ease of use. The docking station is an easy way of adding capabilities to a
notebook PC when it is used in the office. Alternative methods often involve
connecting lots of cables and reconfiguring system files every time you
return from a business trip.
But docking stations also have a major drawback: cost. A docking station
from Compaq has a recommended retail price of Pounds 420, while full-size
monitors and keyboards are extra. This means that you need to spend an extra
Pounds 500 to Pounds 600 to turn your notebook into a fully-fledged desktop
PC.
Docking stations are usually designed to work with notebooks sold by the
same supplier and the full kit (notebook plus docking station, keyboard
etc.) could cost anything from Pounds 2,300 to Pounds 4,500.
This may be more expensive than two desktop PCs (one for home, one for the
office), but it can be cheaper than buying a notebook and a desktop for each
mobile user. Mr Stanley Monger-Godfrey, information technology director at
P&amp;O Properties, says the docking station approach will enable the company to
equip far more of its staff with portable machines.
Cheaper options. For those who find docking stations too expensive, there
are several alternatives. For example, several users who are out of the
office a lot can share a docking station when they need access to printers
and network.
It is also possible to buy slimmed-down docking stations. These are
available from a number of suppliers including Olivetti, NEC, Compaq and
Elonex, as part of a modular range of options for increasing the scope of
notebooks. They are not as easy to use but can cost as little as Pounds 65
for a port duplicator - a bar containing extra ports which plugs into the
back of a notebook PC and can be linked to office printers and peripherals.
Ms Alessandra Bianchini, of Olivetti's product group, says introducing
expansion options has removed the need for 'expensive and cumbersome'
docking stations for its Philos line of notebooks. The options include:
removable hard disks (which can be used with both office PC and notebook), a
port duplicator, internal modem, and credit-card-sized expansion slot
conforming to the PCMCIA standard.
Despite the alternatives, the take-up of docking stations remains healthy if
not spectacular. Compaq says 25 to 35 per cent of its high-end notebooks are
sold with them. At Toshiba the figure is 30 to 40 per cent. IBM says it now
sells docking stations with 50 per cent of its ThinkPad notebooks.
Mr Schrock believes that the main brake on growth is lack of awareness.
'Very few people know how elegantly portable and desktop computing can be
combined,' he says.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (16): For those on the move - The
growing market for subnotebooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for subnotebook computers, roughly the size of a sheet of A5
paper and weighing only a kilogramme or so, is rapidly becoming established.
Only a handful of manufacturers yet produce these miniature versions of
conventional computers but industry standards for the sector are beginning
to emerge and according to Mr Alan Rogers, portable products manager for
Olivetti in the UK: 'It is going to happen'.
One indication that the subnotebook market is more than a flash in the pan
is the fact that Hewlett-Packard of the US and Toshiba of Japan, a pioneer
in mobile computing, have both produced subnotebooks.
The Toshiba machine was launched late last year. It weighs two kilogrammes
and has up to 4.5 hours of battery life.
It is based on an 33 MHz Intel 486 microprocessor and has a thin film
transistor (tft) high resolution colour screen. At Pounds 3,150, it is very
expensive but it offers everything that larger machines are capable of in a
compact passage.
Olivetti of Italy was a pioneer in subnotebooks; its Quaderno, launched more
than two years ago, was a classic of its kind. Small and light, it featured
a non-backlit display and special software for writing notes, carrying out
calculations and so on. Customers liked the concept and the design but found
the screen difficult to read and the special software idiosyncratic.
Nevertheless, according to Mr Rogers, Quaderno users frequently formed
enthusiastic cliques.
The latest version, the Quaderno 33, is larger and heavier but features a
backlit display and conventional PC software running Windows 3.1, Microsoft
Works and Lotus Organiser, a novel program which displays through images of
a traditional paper-based organiser on the computer screen. The new machines
are powerful and well-featured, but have lost the idiosyncratic charm of the
early Quadernos.
Tulip, the Dutch personal computer maker, also manufactures a subnotebook
about the size of the Quaderno, which runs Windows and conventional office
software. It is being used by MAI Research, the market research consultancy,
to collect survey information. Each night the information is transmitted
over the telephone lines to the company's central computer in London.
What distinguishes subnotebooks from personal digital assistants and other
tiny gadgets is the fact that they are the smallest systems which can still
be regarded as conventional personal computers. The screens are small, but
display a full 25 lines or more of text and graphics. Touch typists may
complain about the keyboards but they have all the keys found on larger
machines. Trackballs and mice are built in or can be released from a special
cavity in the computer.
Mr Rogers has a separate definition. He believes that subnotebooks are
portable enough to be carried whether or not they are going to be used -
rather in the manner of a dictation machine or a camera. By comparison,
anybody carrying a notebook intends to put it to use.
Another key to the emergence of subnotebooks is the range of peripherals
which can be provided as standard PCMCIA cards. The size of a credit card
and only slightly thicker, PCMCIA technology encompasses such devices as
hard disk drives, fax modems and radio communications - all in a card just
over 10mm thick at most.
According to the US-based Gartner Group, which tracks technology trends: 'We
believe the PCMCIA standard will have the same impact on mobile computing in
the 1990s that the AT bus did on desktop systems in the 1980s. That is, it
will create a stable platform for system and third party vendors to develop
a wide range of fully compatible peripherals, add-ons and software.'
By 1997, Gartner says, some 60 per cent of all desktop, notebook and
handheld systems shipped worldwide will have at least one PCMCIA slot - say,
40m systems.
As MAI's use of the Tulip device shows, business is not short of ideas for
using subnotebooks. Within a few years, the notebook computer will be the
system of choice for computing in the office; the subnotebook will be the
machine for computing on the move.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (12): US desktop leaders start to
regain high ground - How IBM and Compaq are fighting back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the traditional US leaders in desktop computing have made great
strides in the mobile computing sector over the past 12 months. Compaq,
which pioneered the portable PC market, and IBM, a company distinguished by
many past portable failures, are finally achieving side-by-side success with
their battery-operated ventures.
Compaq has aimed in the past year to regain the technological high ground
from competitors such as Toshiba. In September, it launched its most
innovative notebook computer to date: the Compaq Concerto. This system
features an Intel 486SL processor (running at 25 or 33 Mhz), 4 Mb of RAM,
120 Mb hard disk, a detachable keyboard, the ability to accept commands and
data input from keyboard, pen and mouse - and two expansion slots that
conform to the PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association)
standard.
Perhaps even more importantly, the system was priced at Dollars 2,499 - with
a docking station option for only Dollars 200 more. The set of features
combined with competitive pricing has helped Compaq to a significant mobile
computer hardware market share.
Compaq has also announced plans to release its first subnotebook system
early this year - and to bring out a 'Mobile Companion' handheld system
based on the WinPad technology developed jointly with Microsoft and Intel.
Both should offer the Houston-based computer maker a chance to have an
impact on markets that it has so far shunned, giving smaller competitors
such as Tandy, Gateway 2000 and IBM's Ambra division a chance to pioneer the
demand for these systems.
The highest volume of these new systems is expected to be a 3.9lb
sub-notebook version of the Compaq Contura - which is likely to offer
battery life of up to five hours and sell for less than Dollars 2,000. Like
the Concerto, it will be based on the low-power Intel 486SL processor.
It is easy to see why Compaq wants to get into the subnotebook market.
According to US market research firm Workgroup Technologies, US shipments of
subnotebook systems have demonstrated an annual compound growth rate of
almost 87 per cent since 1992 and are expected to hit the 2m mark this year.
With average prices of between Dollars 1,500 and Dollars 2,000 a unit, that
suggests that subnotebook systems will form a market worth between Dollars
1.5bn and Dollars 2bn in the US alone this year.
IBM, meanwhile, has already made an impact on this growing subnotebook
sector with its ThinkPad range of systems. The basic ThinkPad 500 weighs
only 3.8lb, comes with a 25 or 50 Mhz 486SLC2 processor, promises battery
life of up to six hours and sells for less than Dollars 2,000.
Despite critical praise and high demand for this system, IBM reported late
last year that the ThinkPad 500 was initially plagued by production
difficulties and was now suffering battery problems - and also that, as a
result, production of the machines would be halted temporarily. Production
of ThinkPad systems has now restarted, with IBM hoping that, meanwhile, it
has not lost too much momentum in the market.
At the other end of the mobile computer market, IBM has another new ThinkPad
 -the 750C. This 6.3lb notebook system not only includes a crisp, 10.5 inch
TFT active matrix colour LCD screen, 4 Mb of memory and a 170 Mb hard disk -
but also features two PCMCIA Type II (or one PCMCIA Type III) expansion
slots and built-in audio capabilities.
This allows the ThinkPad to run multimedia applications - although the lack
of a CD-ROM player will limit the number of multimedia software packages
that can actually be installed on it. IBM does, however, offer an optional
external unit for connecting a CD-ROM player. The built-in sound system also
allows voice messages to be recorded on the computer - so that it could
double as a limited function portable dictating machine.
Pricing on the system is still high - though not out of line for a system
with its features. At Dollars 4,699, it is not destined to become a
high-volume system, but it is winning critical praise.
The real point about the ThinkPad mobile computers is that they suggest, for
the first time since IBM starting producing portable computers in 1985 (with
the disastrous IBM PC Portable), that Big Blue is putting creative thought
into their design. The fact that its portable computers are receiving
favourable press compared to existing market leaders - and that IBM has
largely abandoned the price structures that made its systems ridiculously
expensive for many years - all point to future success for IBM in this
market.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (11): Banner ideas are brought to
life - Developments in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
1993 will be remembered as a banner year for mobile computing in North
America. It was the year in which a whole range of technology trends turned
into real products that users could hold in their hands.
Technologies such as hand-writing recognition, pen-based control,
radio-based data communications, cellular data and fax communications,
remote PC and database access and fast, low-power computer processors made
new mobile computing applications possible - and were at the heart of a
number of new mobile personal computers.
These included Apple's Newton - which makes heavy, although not always
accurate, use of hand-writing recognition technology - and the Tandy/Casio
Zoomer. This new category of pocket-sized mobile computer has been dubbed
the personal digital assistant and has already achieved something of a cache
as a 'must-have' for those few yuppies who survived the 1980s.
Apple's biggest push on Newton recently has been with new functions.
Although it has been on the market for several months - and sold more than
50,000 units - Newton has suffered from a lack of add-ons to connect it to
desktop computers.
The answer to this problem came at the autumn Comdex show in Las Vegas in
the form of Apple's Newton Connection kit for Windows - which allows Newton
to exchange information with Windows- equipped IBM-compatible personal
computers. The kit was co-developed with Washington-based Travelling
Software - makers of the popular LapLink software for linking laptop and
desktop computers.
In addition, Apple finally started shipping its long-awaited Dollars 220
Newton FaxModem card with 2400 baud communications speed and Group III fax
compatibility. The company also co-developed this product - this time with
communications specialists Megahertz - and offers it on a PCMCIA (Personal
Computer Memory Card Industry Association) Type II card.
It is also clear that Apple - and arch-rivals Tandy and Casio - will not be
the only companies in the PDA market for much longer. Canadian
computer-maker Darius, one of the first third-party firms to use DEC's
powerful Alpha chip in a desktop computer, has announced plans to develop a
low-cost, high-powered PDA.
Meanwhile, AST recently announced full details of a 1lb 'Zoomer-style' PDA,
using technology it acquired from Tandy's Grid computer operations when it
took over some of Tandy's computer business last year. Currently known as
Model 2390, it will use the same processing chip and Geos operating system
as the recently-released Tandy and Casio Zoomer products - while offering
the Grid PenRight pen computer operating system as an option. Price is
expected to be less than Dollars 1,000.
California-based SunDisk has developed a 40 Mb 'flash' memory card that will
fit in most PCMCIA II slots and interest all PDA and notebook computer
users. While several hard disks in this size have been developed (including
one from SunDisk), it is the first solid-state memory card with this
capacity. It should start shipping by next spring at Dollars 1,995 -
although that price is expected to drop as demand and volume increase.
Newton and Zoomer both include personal productivity applications (such as
diary, notepad and address book) and have spawned a number of add-on
products that allow them to do everything from sending faxes remotely via a
cellular telephone to acting as high-tech pagers.
Even bigger developments are expected next year in this sector as Microsoft
and a group of its hardware partners release handheld computer products
based on a design standard known as 'WinPad'. Such products will use a
cut-down version of Microsoft's popular Windows software, a proprietary set
of low-power computer chips designed by leading chipmaker Intel and will
offer pen-based control of the system.
Like the Newton and Zoomer, WinPad systems will also provide limited
hand-writing recognition and a standard set of personal productivity
applications. Manufacturers currently committed to the development of these
WinPad devices include Compaq, Toshiba, Motorola, NCR and Epson.
Not all handheld computers have been designed for use with pen systems. In
fact, one of the more popular digital assistants in the US is not even
produced there - nor in Japan, for that matter. The Psion Series 3a handheld
computer is produced in the UK by Psion, the handheld computer maker.
Psion has been successful in developing distribution for the Series 3 range
in the US since launching the original system three years ago - and the new
Series 3a system is now available in fashionable US technology shops such as
The Sharper Image. The Series 3a features its own built-in word-processor,
spreadsheet, project management planner and speech recording features - and
sells for less than Dollars 600.
But not all US mobile computing development is in the handheld computing
sector. There is still a great deal of activity in subnotebooks, notebooks
and even luggable computers.
At last autumn's Comdex, for example, one of the most notable new systems
came from luggable computer manufacturer Dolch Computers Systems, which
offers the world's first Pentium-based portable computer. It also happens to
be the first computer of this size to use liquid-cooling to reduce the heat
generated by the Pentium processor. A small fluorocarbon liquid pack is
placed on top of the chip to absorb the much-publicised heat of the Pentium
to a 'heat sink' system that evenly dissipates it throughout the system.
It will be released in two versions - the PAC-586 and the A-PAC. The first
is a straightforward, high-power, 20lb colour 'lunchbox', mains-powered
portable, while the second will add a CD-ROM drive, sound card, a microphone
and stereo speakers to enable it to handle multimedia software. Prices will
start at around Dollars 6,000.
Another unusual portable computing plan comes from DEC - which is talking
about using a planned low-power version of its powerful Alpha chip in both a
laptop computer as well as a PDA. The company says it is also talking to
people in the personal digital assistant business - raising the possibility
of handheld, Apple Newton-style Alpha-based devices probably running some
form of the Microsoft At Work software architecture. DEC hopes that such a
move would give Alpha the broad-based, high-volume sales it needs to make it
competitive with other offerings.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (14): The pace may accelerate -
Battery Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As mobile electronics races ahead, batteries are revealed ever more clearly
as the Achilles heel of the portable computer. While processors, memories
and even screens double in performance every two or three years, battery
technology improves by perhaps 10 to 20 per cent over the same period.
Now that the electronics industry has come to realise quite what an obstacle
batteries are to future progress, manufacturers are beginning to team up
with battery companies to force the pace of development.
For example, Compaq recently announced a partnership with Duracell to
develop standard-sized nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries for
portable computers. But the integrated Japanese electronics companies, which
manufacture batteries as well as computers and other mobile devices, are
emerging as a particularly strong source of innovation in this field.
There is a good prospect that the higher priority now being given to
batteries will lead over the next five years to devices that pack much more
energy into a smaller space than anything available today. Then
manufacturers will be able to design 'sub-notebook' sized computers with
power-hungry features such as colour screens and built-in disk drives.
Most of the current generation of portable computers were designed to run on
throw-away alkaline batteries or rechargeable nickel-cadmium (NiCad) packs.
They can generally manage three to five hours of operation before needing to
be recharged - not enough to do much work on an intercontinental flight.
NiCad was developed originally in the 1960s and is now getting close to the
limits of its potential performance. It is also environmentally suspect,
since cadmium is a toxic metal which can contaminate groundwater if NiCad
cells are dumped in unsuitable landfill sites.
The leading green contenders to replace NiCad are nickel-metal hydride
(NiMH) and lithium ion (Lion). Both originated in Japan and both are
beginning to appear in upmarket portable computers. Last month, for example,
IBM added NiMH to its ThinkPad sub-notebook computers, while Toshiba's
T3400CT will be Lion-powered.
Lion can pack more usable energy into a given weight of battery than NiMH,
but it is a more sensitive material and less good at delivering the
relatively high power required for a disk drive. Most observers expect both
technologies to enjoy a good run at the expense of NiCad over the next few
years, though the long- term future probably lies with lithium-based
systems. (For electrochemical reasons, lithium is theoretically the best
metal of all to use in batteries.)
At the research stage, a particularly exciting prospect is the lithium
polymer (LiPol) battery. This contains a solid plastic film as the
electrolyte - the material that carries charge between the electrodes -
instead of the liquid electrolyte used in today's batteries.
LiPol's energy output per gramme is likely to be twice as good as Lion and
six times better than NiCad. Another great advantage is that LiPol need not
have the chunky shape of today's batteries. It can be produced equally well
as flexible sheets less than a millimetre thick, which can be cut or folded
into whatever size and configuration best suits the appliance in question.
Many laboratories around the world are working on LiPol. They include the
Japanese giants such as Sony, Californian start-ups such as Valence
Technology, and universities such as St Andrews in Scotland.
While computer manufacturers wait for a breakthrough in battery technology,
they are constantly taking steps to make the most of the batteries that are
available, by reducing the power consumption of their products. An obvious
example is the memory card used instead of a disk drive in sub-notebook
computers.
Software-based power management systems also help to extend battery life, by
sending the computer to sleep when the user is doing something else for a
few minutes and then allowing him or her to resume at exactly the same
point.
The chip makers are playing their part too, by developing special low-power
low-voltage processors such as the Intel 486SL for portable applications.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (13): Benefits of a digital
network - George Black spotlights areas of growth in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emergence of a Pan-European digital telephone network could give a big
boost to the development of mobile computing in the next few years.
This is predicted by Mr Jeff Goldberg, industry analyst at market research
company Dataquest. GSM, or Groupe Speciale Mobile, is the digital network
which is beginning to replace the established analogue telephone networks
across Europe.
Mr Goldberg sees GSM as a major strategic advantage for Europe which will
make it much easier and cheaper to provide network data services to mobile
computer users. By 1996, GSM modems which enable telephones to be easily
used in any European country will stimulate a boom in mobile computers of
all kinds, he says.
The main area of growth will probably be a new generation of devices which
combine the features of the current personal organisers or personal digital
assistants (PDAs) with those of the cellular phone.
Much will depend on how European governments react to the opportunity. The
UK is well placed to derive substantial commercial advantages because of its
relatively free telecommunications environment.
Most other European countries have yet to decide whether to follow the UK
into total deregulation or to use state power to subsidise the building of
the necessary communications infrastructure.
The prospects for mobile computer vendors in the second half of the 1990s,
whether selling notebooks, subnotebooks, laptops, palmtops, organisers or
PDAs, look excellent.
Organisers and PDAs, though generating a lot of public interest, are still a
very small market sector. Only around 400,000 were sold across Europe in
1993, compared with about 1.6m notebook computers, which cost roughly 10
times as much. But the spread of GSM could turn organisers into a much more
significant market.
The UK has a good start in this field. Its 34 per cent of the European
market for organisers represents by far the largest share. This is largely
attributable to the strength of Psion in its domestic market and the fact
that the British are traditionally keen on gadgets of all kinds.
But whether Psion will be able to capitalise on this success across Europe
is uncertain. The German and French markets are dominated by Sharp, though
it has lost market share to Psion recently.
Meanwhile competition is rapidly intensifying. General Magic, the US
developer spun off from Apple, has just launched its Magic Cap system. This
is described as graphical user interface software which can provide the
basis for a range of palmtop or personal organiser applications, using wired
or wireless messaging facilities. Shareholders in General Magic include
Apple, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Philips, Sony and Matsushita.
Another serious threat to Psion's position will come from Compaq and
Microsoft, which are collaborating to launch a multi-function pen-based
device, presently known as Winpad. This will take the leading notebook
vendor and the leading personal computer software company together into a
new and potentially very lucrative field.
Compaq has been the leader in notebook computers in most European countries
in the past year. The market is much more uniform across Europe than that
for organisers, enabling Compaq to benefit from a strong marketing campaign,
improved technology and lower prices.
It has leapt ahead of its main rival, Toshiba, across Europe to take around
20 per cent of the market compared to Toshiba's 14 per cent.
The German market has been enlarged by the entry of retail chains, such as
Vobis and Escom, selling their own low-priced machines. According to Mr
Stephan Heinrich, product marketing manager for leading international
distributor Computer 2000, until a year ago only large companies in Germany
bought notebooks, mainly for their sales forces.
Now the market is beginning to spread to private users, he says. For this
reason Compaq has recently followed the retailers in advertising its
notebooks on German television.
The French notebook market grew by 30 per cent last year, according to Mr
Maurice Brakha, managing director, France, fordistributor Merisel, compared
to 12 per cent for the personal computer business as a whole.
Mr Brakha says that sales were boosted by new models with larger memories,
better graphics and longer-lasting batteries. 'Mobile users need these
things because for them these are tools, not toys,' he explains.
Italy is the exception to the rule. Olivetti, Europe's only major indigenous
notebook manufacturer, remains dominant there because of the word-of-mouth
market, which is not susceptible to the marketing techniques of other
European countries. The UK, France and Germany may therefore prove easier
nuts to crack for mobile computer vendors.
1994 is likely to see a rather more marked shift of purchases from desktop
machines to portables across Europe. The UK will probably be the best
immediate prospect for vendors of both notebooks and organisers, as France
and Germany are set to remain locked in recession for at least the next few
months.
Next year and 1996 should see more rapid growth. The biggest opportunity is
in Germany, but the market for organisers remains very small. Most Germans
remain very critical of these machines. Apple's Newton had some poor reviews
in Germany, in which it was dismissed as a toy.
Sales of organisers in France have also been slow so far. The Apple Newton
has not yet reached the French shops, but it may do better in France than
Germany, as Apple's desktop and notebook machines have proved very popular
there and the French have shown great enthusiasm for graphical user
interfaces.
If the Germans and the French can be persuaded to buy organisers, Sharp
looks the most likely winner, with Apple benefiting from its success.
Sharp's own organiser incorporates some Apple technology and it manufactures
the Newton for Apple. Sharp also has joint ventures with several other
technology developers.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (8): It's not so easy as ABC -
Prospects in Asia and its biggest market, Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS NORMILE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That the country which took the lead in making electronic devices portable
should have also led the way with portable computers is not surprising.
Seiko Epson claims to have been the first company to put a transportable
computer on the market with its liquid crystal display in 1982. Toshiba
defined the laptop class with its T1100 series, released in 1989, and was
also ahead of the field in making computing truly mobile with the Dynabook,
the first notebook computer, in 1989.
Japanese companies are still virtually the only suppliers of a key component
that makes mobile computers mobile: liquid crystal displays. And these days,
the only computers exported from Japan are portable models.
Japan is also far and away Asia's largest single computer market. Sales of
personal computers in Japan rose steadily through the 1980s, but have been
stagnant for the past three years at about 2.2m units a year, of which about
40 per cent are laptops and notebooks.
Apart from Japan, reliable figures on the Asian mobile computer market are
hard to come by. Dataquest Japan, the market research company, estimates the
combined volume of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore at roughly equal
to Japan's market, but puts the share of mobile computers at far less, at
around 10 per cent.
Analysts forecast a resumption of growth in Japan's PC market this year,
expanding to 3m units or more a year by 1995. Japan has the world's highest
ratio of portables and remains Asia's most important mobile computing
market.
Japan's affinity for portables, however, is not based on their mobility but
on their size. In Japan - and to some extent in Korea - notebook computers
are not used for computing on the go, but in place of desktop systems. They
take up less space in cramped offices than their bulky, full-sized cousins.
And therein lies the nub of differing views over future directions of
Japan's market.
According to Dataquest, although volume has been stagnant, the value of the
market has crept up. A price war initiated in Japan by Compaq of the US has
cut prices to half or less what they were just two years ago. But rather
than go downmarket, buyers have been tempted to stretch their budgets,
buying computers with faster processors, more memory and bigger hard disks.
Mr Katsushi Shiga, a Dataquest analyst, sees this trend carrying over to the
notebook market. In particular, as colour liquid crystal displays become
more affordable, he expects notebooks with colour displays to replace
desktop systems for applications needing colour. He says this could help
boost the notebook segment to 60 per cent of a growing market.
A contrary view comes from Mr Makio Inui, a Kleinwort Benson International
analyst. He also sees an upturn in personal computer sales beginning this
year, based on rising demand from corporate users, who account for some 70
per cent of the market. But he believes purchasing managers in Japan will be
under pressure to get as much computing power as they can for as few yen.
This, Mr Inui concludes, favours the more economical desktop systems, and he
sees a fall in the share of the market held by notebook computers. While the
majority of mobile computers in Japan move no further than from one corner
of a desk to another, the electronic organisers that slip into a jacket
pocket get carried around. These are seen as the forerunners of the personal
digital assistants now coming onto the market.
The new devices, relying on pen-input, will be a boon in Asian countries,
such as Japan, which use Chinese characters for the written language. One
reason that computers - mobile or otherwise - are rarely used by senior
Japanese executives is that they never learned to type. There were
mechanical analogues to western typewriters for Chinese characters, but they
were unwieldy and difficult to use.
The younger generation has grown up using word processors and computers, but
their elders are afflicted with 'keyboard allergy'. But the same Chinese
characters that would make pen-input devices particularly useful make them
extremely difficult to realise. The algorithms that are slow and error-prone
in recognising the 26 letters of the English alphabet have a more daunting
task in trying to identify the roughly 2,000 characters used in Japanese
newspapers.
Pen-input machines and software with acceptable speed and accuracy are
likely to emerge later in Asia than in the US and Europe. This means that
except for a number of specialised niches, the size of the keyboard is still
likely to limit the extent to which machines for serious mobile computing
can shrink, even more so in Asia than in America and Europe.
The pen-input personal digital assistants are likely to find a niche in Asia
as specialised tools. They might be used, for example, to tick off
deliveries on an electronic form. For more general use, PDAs may prove their
worth for checking electronic mail and as sophisticated paging devices.
Mr Inui sees the ability to send 10 to 20 lines of text to roving sales
staff and travelling executives as creating a niche for PDAs equipped with
receivers. But the growth of this market will require the blessing of
telecommunications authorities, which he sees as slow in coming in Japan.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (9): Tadpole faces big rival -
Portable Workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clive Thompson is a software engineer at British Telecom's Martlesham Heath
research centre in Suffolk. He designs complex software systems to manage
international data and telecom networks. This is not work that fits on a
standard desktop PC. The prime tool of such software developers is the high
performance workstation, characterised by the Sun computer. Running the Unix
operating system, these machines give engineers the power to twist and test
intricate patterns of figures - the number-crunching of computer lore.
The dilemma for Mr Thompson is that his clients are BT senior managers,
spread about the country. They are not always found next to a Sun
workstation. Without that facility, it is impossible to demonstrate the
latest step in network software. BT had to find a way to pick up a
workstation and carry the demonstration around.
The answer was a portable computer produced by Cambridge-based Tadpole
Technology. Tadpole set out to fit a Unix-friendly chip into a small
portable frame and came up with the Sparcbook. Sparc refers to the Unix chip
developed by Sun and now in the domain of the Sparc International group, an
industry combine including AT&amp;T. Tadpole began to deliver the Sparcbook in
1992, marketed as the ultimate in notebook sized PCs.
The Sparcbook is not a cheap toy. Entry level machines cost Pounds 4,300,
with more powerful models selling for up to Pounds 13,475. But it was the
only option for BT staff who needed to transport and display sophisticated
software. Using a network was not realistic, since Unix workstations would
still be required to receive and run the program. Nor would carrying the
software on disk, to be loaded up before each demonstration, work. 'You
can't simply load and go as you would with a standard package,' Mr Thompson
says. 'If I did that, I'd spend more time configuring it than carrying out
the demonstration.'
While BT is impressed with the Sparcbook, Mr David Thurgate, a technical
analyst with Barclays Network Services, has reservations. Mr Thurgate tried
to find a way of heaving a large Unix database about to keep executives up
to speed outside normal office hours. The Sparcbook constituted 'a bit of a
desperate solution'.
Though the second, current, release of the product is an improvement,
Sparcbook One was unable to emulate the graphics of the Sun workstation.
'The screen handling was not that good. It was a slow display connected to a
fast computer.'
In the event, Mr Thurgate decided that Unix in a briefcase was not right for
executives hooked to this database. However, his software developers may
have a use for the Sparcbook. 'We're not talking about people using it on a
train. You'd use it to carry the database around and plug it into a fixed
screen.' The high price of the Sparcbook was not a factor, however. Mr
Thurgate believes that for highly technical applications the price tag is
irrelevant.
Tadpole has enjoyed a prominent role in bringing Unix out on the streets.
But its comparative success, turning over Pounds 23m in 1993, has attracted
competition. IBM will launch a Unix portable shortly. This will be aimed at
customers of its RS6000 Unix machines who need to bring their software home
at night. It will be based around the Power PC chip developed out of an
alliance with Apple and Motorola.
In its new and humbler incarnation, IBM admits to technical alliances with
other suppliers. And the post-restructuring culture seems to have produced
unaccustomed generosity among IBM executives. Mr John Barnes, IBM RS6000
product manager, praises Tadpole's contribution in opening up a niche
market. 'There's a market for Unix portables because Tadpole has established
it.' Perhaps that explains IBM's ambitions for its own Power Unix portable
PC.
IBM believes that enough people need the specialised strengths of Unix on
the move and are willing to pay for the privilege. The substantial cost of
this equipment has drawbacks for more than the company accountant. Theft is
a major worry. But the institution that needs this capability tends to have
deep pockets.
Mr Michael Bentley, a systems administrator at merchant bank Merrill Lynch,
is a Sparcbook user. The bank's staff has a nomadic existence and relies on
Unix. 'Offshore Debt bought four, for around Pounds 9,000 apiece.' Is he
concerned about small portable computers that approach the price of a
company car? 'If we lose one, we write it off.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (10): Dell dips as Zenith zooms -
Contrasting market fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few contrasts are more stark in the mobile computing market than the 1993
fortunes of Dell Computer and Zenith Data Systems. While Dell had to recall
its systems and withdraw from the notebook market after poor sales, Zenith
rebounded after a lean period to claim sales gains in North America last
year of 86 per cent.
Dell's misfortunes began with the release of its lightweight 320SLi notebook
computer - which aimed to combine long battery life with a low price. The
design, however, did not hold up well to the rigours of portable computing.
Users complained about 'easy to lose' rubber covers over expansion ports,
the lack of a backlit screen (a feature designed to save battery power) and
overheating when in use for an extended period.
The overheating was so serious that Dell had to recall the systems. However,
the Texan computer maker says that it is committed to introducing new
notebook and subnotebook computers this year - and recently hired Mr John
Medica, a former Apple Computer executive, as a vice-president.
Mr Medica was instrumental in the design contracting of Apple's successful
PowerBook range of mobile computers - developed in conjunction with Sony of
Japan.
US analysts already predict that Mr Medica will seek Sony's help in the
design of new Dell products - and that these will be subnotebook systems
with both colour and monochrome displays. Sharp is expected to supply the
colour screens for these systems, which may be launched in the second half
of this year.
In the meantime, Dell is likely to unveil a range of 'interim' mobile
computing systems that will be the result of Original Equipment Manufacturer
agreements currently under negotiation with portable computer maker AST
Research. These machines will probably be based on AST's Bravo range of
notebook systems.
While Dell has been suffering, laptop PC pioneer Zenith Data Systems (now a
subsidiary of Paris-based Groupe Bull) has been crowing about its recent
rebound in the notebook computer market. The company claims to have shipped
more than 150,000 portable computer systems to North America alone last year
 -almost twice its volume in 1992.
At the heart of this success has been the company's Z-Lite subnotebook
computer range, which has earned high marks from reviewers for its long
battery life, comparatively low price and expansion options.
According to Mr Alan Soucy, vice-president of the ZDS mobile systems
division, one key to the company's current philosophy about mobile systems
is that docking stations - the add-on boxes that portable computer makers
have traditionally used to provide desktop expansion power for their systems
 -have no place in the market any more.
Instead, Zenith is offering PCMCIA-compatible expansion slots on all its
subnotebook computer products - and at less than Dollars 1,000, a new
'personal server' designed to offer desktop functions to portable PC users
in a more flexible way.
The personal server features Ethernet network connections to portables. It
is about the size of toaster, yet offers room for lots of storage, as well
as hard-to-add devices such as a CD-ROM player. In addition, several
portable computer users can connect to the personal server at once.
Mr Soucy says that docking stations, by contrast, require that only one user
can connect at any one time, that the connection be made with an
often-clumsy, multiple pin - and that users buy a new docking station every
time they get a new model or brand of portable computer.
The other big push for ZDS in 1994 will be in the personal digital assistant
market. Three products will be launched in the current calendar year - one
for wireless local area network connection to PCs, another with embedded
wide area communications capabilities and the third designed more along
industry-standard lines.
It is expected that the first two of these systems will be more 'personal
communicator' products than full-blown handheld computers - while the third
is likely to be based on a variation of the Microsoft at Work architecture
and to use an Intel microprocessor. All systems will offer pen-based input.
ZDS will price at least one of the systems at around Dollars 500 to make
high volume inroads into the market - responding to press criticism at the
high prices of Apple's Newton and the Tandy/Casio Zoomer.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (7): The odd one out mounts a
strong challenge - The fortunes of Apple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple, almost always the odd one out in personal computers, is mounting a
strong challenge in both notebooks and personal organisers with
idiosyncratic products.
Somehow, it has made a virtue out of being non-standard, where many other
computer firms have run into a wave of criticism for it.
Alone among leading PC makers, Apple adopted Motorola rather than Intel
chips and on them built a strong brand loyalty to its machines.
Mr Chris Herbert, senior research analyst at PC market monitoring firm
Romtec, says: 'Apple has extremely strong support among its users.' It
retains a 10 per cent share of the total UK market for PC, which is still
rapidly growing, and has taken third place in the UK notebook market behind
Toshiba with around 45 per cent and Compaq with 22 per cent.
But Compaq and Toshiba increased their joint share in 1993 to 67 per cent
from around 55 per cent the previous year, with Toshiba's sales almost
doubling. Competition will be equally severe in most other countries.
Apple is struggling to win acceptance in the corporate market, where Compaq
is often the official alternative hardware supplier to IBM. Apple's
supporters claim that, if it were left to users, a large proportion would
choose Apple, but many companies have a purchasing policy which will not let
them do so.
Two shrewd decisions by Apple in the past couple of years have helped it to
stay among the leaders. The first was the diversification of its previously
too rigid sales channels. Instead of marketing entirely through dealers, it
appointed Frontline and Ingram as master distributors and started selling
through high street shops such as Dixons and John Lewis.
Secondly, it tore up its recommended retail prices, going further than some
of its competitors in declining even to suggest prices. This was generally
welcomed by its resellers. Price-cutting followed, which enabled Apple to
regain some lost market share.
Its Macintosh PowerBook notebooks, introduced in 1991, had sold over 1m in
the UK by the end of last year. Although they have had very good reviews,
the company has not had quite the same success with them as it had with its
desktop machines. Its market share of notebooks in the UK is around 7 per
cent, whereas in the desktop market it has 11-12 per cent.
The PowerBook runs on a Motorola 68030 chip and copies the intuitive,
what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) software environment of the desktop
Macintosh, rather than using industry standard Microsoft DOS and Windows.
Its built-in trackball in the centre of the keyboard instead of a mouse is
said to be easier to handle for the mobile user. Compaq also has such a
device on some models, but few others do.
PowerBooks have been praised for the clarity of their active-matrix screens
in varying light conditions and for giving clear advance warnings of battery
rundown. Tests have shown that Intel 486 machines have greater power than
PowerBooks when running standard applications software such as spreadsheets,
but few users seem to find this an issue.
The Duo docking system allows a PowerBook loaded with the latest versions of
files to be released from the desktop machine after the parent files have
been closed. Mr Tim Clark, marketing director of KRCS, Apple's largest UK
reseller, says this allows users to take work home in the evening without
the risk of confusion over file versions. File confusion has been a problem
for users of some other systems.
Apple generated heavy publicity for its Newton 'messagepad', or personal
digital assistant, launched in the UK in September. Reviews and comments
have been mixed for the pen-based machines, which combine the functions of
personal organiser, information source and games player. Applications
software from other developers for the Newton remains scarce. Only 12
programs have been offered so far.
Opinion is divided over how well it can recognise handwriting. Even the
occasional word misinterpreted can lose it credibility among perfectionists.
The sector is very price-sensitive. Sales are likely to come mainly through
high street stores, where plenty of other makes will be on offer.
According to Mr Craig Sears-Black, Apple's director of personal interactive
electronics, 50,000 Newtons were sold in the first six weeks up to
mid-September in the US and UK.
However, UK resellers say that at the original price of about Pounds 600
they did not sell well, though recently on special offer at about Pounds 400
sales have begun to pick up.
Mr Clark of KRCS says there is still a lot to be done to explain to users
the communications facilities. These are still far from complete and will be
essential for Apple to persuade big companies to use Newton as a data
collection tool which can save time and money spent in rekeying.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (6): The paper dilemma - Portable
Printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The computer industry has always fought a marketing battle against its own
complicated products. If you want to sell a personal computer, you have to
persuade the customer that he is buying a smart but simple tool. The mere
suggestion of programming or wiring up connections to printers and other
peripherals is still enough to deter many users.
The portable computer had to establish a foothold in the face of profound
scepticism. Bulky initial models in the mid-1980s demanded more muscle than
technological knowhow. The portable has grown up since then, acquired a new
identity as the notebook and become truly convenient.
But the question of hard copy remains. Do users want or need the extra
weight and size of an integral printer? How important is it to get the data
off the screen and onto paper when you are away from the office?
Canon has made the running with small lightweight printers. Apple sells this
range under its own badge. Canon's BN22 notebook computer was launched last
July and has sold over 2,000 copies so far. Prices range from Pounds 1,899
to Pounds 2,449, and whatever the specification, a printer is built into the
machine.
Mr Graham Salmons, Canon project manager, reckons the integral printer is
essential, but only for a specific category of user. 'These are the
genuinely mobile users, people who always use the notebook on its battery.'
An insurance salesman's customer may need a policy on the spot, not through
the post. Drivers with haulage companies have to print out a receipt after
dropping off a few thousand gallons of petrol.
The BN22 is approximately the size of a telephone book, with a keyboard that
lifts to allow paper to be slotted through and printed over. The BJ10 is a
similar A4-sized device, but is a dedicated printer. 'It's designed to be a
portable printer. You can run it off the battery, but only 15 per cent of
users do that,' says Mr Salmons. Canon has sold 500,000 of the Pounds 299
BJ10s since October 1991. So the stand-alone printer definitely has the edge
in portable computing.
Hewlett-Packard has an established track record in printers and has ventured
into very small notebook computers with the Omnibook. But the company has no
plans to merge both areas of expertise. 'The main priority in designing a
notebook is size. If you want a printer you can buy it as a separate
product,' says Ms Joanne Talfourd-Cook, PC product manager.
The Deskjet is a portable printer from Hewlett-Packard; ithas the dimensions
of a tissue-box and costs Pounds 230. The Omnibook retails for Pounds 999
and Ms Talfourd-Cook is confident it can do the job without a built-in
printer. 'To be honest, we don't appeal to people who want to print on the
go.'
The Deskjet is designed to appeal to customers whom Hewlett-Packard
characterises as the 'carry and park' brigade. Professionals such as
auditors will move their printer from site to site, and need something light
and portable. But they still set up shop in one location, running off the
mains.
Compaq claims 20 per cent of the UK's 230,000 annual sales of notebook
computers. But none of its portables embody a printer and the company no
longer manufactures printers. Mr Lewis Schrock, product manager, is happy
for his notebook customers to decide what quality of print they want and
then go to Canon or other companies with a pedigree in the field. 'Our
strength is PC technology, Canon's is printers. So a built-in printer is a
logical development for Canon products.'
The mobile printing option extends beyond a choice of hardware. Many
portables now include a fax card. So faxing from a hotel room to the house
fax machine is a practical and popular way to pick up hard copy.
And software has come up with some clever answers. On The Road (OTR) is a
program marketed in the UK by Middlesex-based Teleadapt and aimed at the
mobile Apple Powerbook user who wants to exploit the heavy-duty print option
available in the office.
The Powerbook user installs OTR for Pounds 80 and the machine recognises
when it is no longer connected to a printer, but stores the print command
until the physical connection is made. The document is printed out
automatically whenever the Powerbook is plugged in at one of several preset
locations.
Apple is quite content with shortcuts that evade the portable printer
dilemma. 'If you go for an integral printer you have to take something out.
Our research indicates people don't want that,' says Ms Kate Cruickshank,
Apple notebook product manager.
Its remote access facility allows the Apple user to log on to the office
network and printers from a distance. The user plugs the Powerbook into a
phone jack and sends the document to a server at his home base. This checks
his password and then treats the mobile terminal as part of the local
network. Apple regards this as more practical than travelling with a
printer. 'I know of very few people who need to print out on the road,' Ms
Cruickshank adds.
The significance of portable printers is dictated entirely by the way
individuals do business. Mr Salmons of Canon declares that his portable
printer is a commercial success because 'the one thing that business still
relies on is paper'. At merchant bankers SG Warburg, powerful Sparcbook
portables help demonstrate cross-border leasing proposals to customers.
Mr Tim Stone, a Warburg director, is not interested in lugging a printer
around, no matter how light. 'Paper is rarely needed at the point where we
use the machine, and you can always generate a fax with this equipment. It's
so rare that I need paper, I try to avoid it altogether.' Just as notebook
computers fill a niche, so portable printing is a matter of taste.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (4): Solutions are starting to
emerge - Data Transmission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the portable computer user who needs to exchange data with the office,
plugging a modem into a telephone socket is fine when one is available. But
on the move, wireless telecommunications provide the only real solution.
Indeed, the success of new lightweight handheld computing devices such as
personal digital assistants is likely to depend to a large degree on the
effective integration of data processing and telecommunications functions.
It has been possible for some time to transmit data over an analogue
cellular telephone system such as the Cellnet or Vodaphone networks in the
UK, though it is generally more difficult, slower and considerably more
expensive than over the fixed public switched telephone network.
These factors, together with concerns about line quality and dropped calls,
have meant that relatively few business customers use cellular telephone
systems to transmit data.
For those cellular voice customers who do require data communications, one
solution has been to use a special cellular modem. For example, in the UK
Vodafone's mobile data service uses a special cellular data link control
(CDLC) modem to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free data
over its network.
It is also possible to use a device called a cellular line interface (CLI)
in conjunction with a standard modem and a some mobile telephones
manufactured by NEC and Motorola.
This was the solution chosen by Mercury Mobile Services for its client,
Unisys, when the US computer group needed to 'bolt on' a data transmission
service for its UK-based team of field engineers who already had car
telephones linked to the Vodaphone network.
Using their notebook computers and plug-in Multitech PCMCIA card modems, the
engineers can now call up and download a manual page from the roadside at a
data speed of 4,800 bps.
Data transmission over the new generation of digital cellular telephone
systems, such as the Global System for Mobiles services in Europe which have
just started up, should be even simpler, faster and more reliable.
The GSM specification includes a facility which will eventually allow any
terminal - for example, a portable facsimile machine or a notebook computer
 -to be plugged directly into the handset.
Another option for those customers who want the benefits of both voice and
data communications from a moving vehicle is to use a two-way public access
mobile radio service such as the UK's National Band Three. Users buy their
own communic- ations equipment and then pay a fixed monthly subscription -
there are no call charges.
Nevertheless, for those mobile computer users who require a high speed, high
quality wireless data link, dedicated packet-switched data networks such as
Ardis - a joint venture between IBM and Motorola - and Ram Broad- casting in
the US, Ram Mobile Data in the UK and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom's Datex-P
argue that they offer a more efficient service.
This new breed of dedicated data telecommunications networks has been
spawned by the wave of liberalisation sweeping through telecom- munications
regimes in the US, Europe and elsewhere, and it already looks like being
fiercely competitive.
In the US market, aside from Ardis and Ram Broadcasting, AT&amp;T's cellular
subsidiary, McCaw Cellular Commun- ications, is upgrading its network to
carry packet- switched data communications and expects to cover more than
100 cities by the end of this year.
The McCaw network is expected to be used for wireless data communications by
personal digital assistants manufactured by EO, another AT&amp;T subsidiary,
which is building PDAs in competition with Apple's Newton.
In the UK five companies were originally awarded 25-year mobile data network
licences in October 1991. However after a shake-out there are now three
mobile data network operators, Cognito and Ram Mobile Data, a joint venture
involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish
Telcom and Bouygues, and Paknet which is now owned by Vodafone and was
awarded a mobile licence in addition to its existing fixed data licence.
Although subscriber growth has been slower than many analysts expected, Mr
John Jarvis, Ram Mobile Data's chief executive, says he met his forecasts
last year.
Ram is attempting to attract new business customers by taking a lead in
developing applications software for the mobile data market - viewed by many
as the key to future growth. 'We have about 40 applications of one sort or
another,' says Mr Jarvis, of which about a dozen are finished.
Ram also believes that its use of Ericsson's Mobitex network hardware, which
is beginning to emerge as a de facto standard in Europe, will help attract a
growing number of multinational business customers and should event- ually
enable its subscribers to 'roam' throughout Europe as well as generating
economies of scale.
The cost of radio modems for network use has already fallen to about Pounds
300 each when purchased in volume, several hundred pounds cheaper than just
eight months ago. Thus, even though mobile data has had a sluggish start,
most analysts still expect dramatic growth in the market over the next five
years - fuelled largely by the growth in mobile computing and the next
generation of PDAs.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (3): Modems get faster and
smarter - Progress in an important area of communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most serious portable computer users a modem is another essential piece
of kit to be packed alongside the spare battery pack, the power adapter and
connecting cables.
A modem (modulator/de-modulator) enables a computer to exchange digital data
over an older-style analogue telephone line with another machine, typically
a head-office computer which is also equipped with a modem.
Traditionally, portable modems have commanded a 40 per cent price premium
over their desktop counterparts, but new competition is beginning to erode
the differential.
At the same time, advances in silicon integration and chip design have
enabled modem manufacturers to build much smaller devices - including some
which fit into the credit-card sized PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association) slots found in an increasing number of portables.
This new breed of lightweight portable modems offers much faster
transmission speeds than its predecessors, with sophisticated data
compression and error correction features and increasingly the ability to
send and receive faxes as well as data.
Until recently, the portable computer user had relatively little choice in
terms of modems. Often the only alternatives were paying a premium price for
a proprietary internally fitted card-modem, or buying an external
cigarette-packet sized portable modem made by one of only a handful of
manufacturers. Most devices were capable only of transmitting data at a
relatively slow 2,400bps (bits per second), also known as V22bis.
While competition was fierce and modem prices fell quickly in the US, in
Europe the price of modems approved for connection to the public telephone
systems has remained high, sparking controversy in the UK in particular and
encouraging a flood of imports that have not been passed by the British
Approvals Board for Telecommunications.
While market analysts and others have argued that the price of approved
modems has been maintained artificially in Europe, manufacturers, including
the recently formed Modem Approvals Group in the UK, insist that the higher
prices reflect the added costs and delays involved in obtaining separate
approval for devices for use in each of the main European markets.
In the longer term the European Commission plans a streamlined pan-European
approvals process, although this is unlikely to be in place much before the
end of the decade. In the meantime, however, some US modem manufactures,
including US Robotics and Express Technology, have broken ranks and begun
selling cut price, high-speed BABT-approved desktop modems in the UK.
Modems are also getting faster and smarter. The current business standard is
for data transmission at 14,400bps (also known as V32bis) coupled with V42
error correction and V42bis data compression which allow even higher
transmission speeds. Most portable models, which currently cost from about
Pounds 200 to Pounds 400, can also send facsimile messages.
Some notebook computers, such as AST's PowerExec and Bravo ColourPlus
ranges, are now being bundled with high-speed PCMCIA modems - in AST's case
Pace Micro Communications' new Microlin V32bis fax/modem.
Meanwhile a new international standard, dubbed V Fast or V34, covering data
transmission at 28,800bps is expected to be agreed by the International
Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications standards committee shortly.
However, the delay in approving this new standard has already led to a
confusing plethora of new proprietary interim standards including 19.2Kbps,
V32 turbo and V Fast Class (VFC) promoted by various manufacturers.
While modem hardware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, so is the
software which operates with it. For example, US-based XcelleNet has
developed an integrated suite of remote business applications and
communications software, which has been dubbed RemoteWare.
RemoteWare, which is already used by more than 400 companies in the US and a
growing number of customers in the UK including Windsor Life, the direct
sales assurance company, enables head-office IT staff to manage
communications - including distributing software - with portable computers
in the field over ordinary dial-up telephone lines.
Currently most portable modems, including PCMCIA card modems, are designed
to be plugged into a wall telephone socket. However some niche products are
designed to cope with special situations. For example Tricom, a UK-based
manufacturer, sells modems which are designed to work with 'virtually any
telephone in the world'.
The company's two Pearl fax/modems feature a fold-out device which can be
attached to the telephone handset enabling them to be used with pay phones,
mobiles, hotel phones or anywhere else where a telephone wall socket is not
available.
However wireless modems, designed to be used with the existing analogue
cellular telephone services or, in the case of the Ram Mobidem, with the new
breed of dedicated mobile packet-switched data networks, represent the
ultimate in portability since they will allow mobile computer users to
transmit or receive data and faxes from virtually anywhere.
Eventually, however, there may be no need for modems at all since, at least
in theory, it should be possible to plug a digital device, including
portable computers, directly into the next generation of mobile telephones
operating on digital cellular networks. Some devices, such as personal
digital assistants, may even combine the portable data processing and voice
telecommunications functions.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (5): Too soon to write off the
cathode ray tube - Screen Technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the first 'luggable' portable computers began to appear a decade ago,
many used miniature mono-cathode ray tubes for their displays - mimicking
their early desktop counterparts.
But CRTs, although cheap, were heavy and power-hungry. They were quickly
replaced by the thin, flat liquid crystal displays which have helped define
the clam-shell design of the notebook computer and are now appearing in the
next generation of pen-based computers and personal digital assistants.
From their discovery more than a century ago liquid crystals, which share
the properties of both liquids and solids, remained a laboratory curiosity
until 1963 when RCA, the US broadcasting company, found that by applying an
electrical charge, the liquid crystal molecules could be made to realign so
that they either passed, or blocked, polarised light.
Another decade passed before Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group,
sold the first calculator with a liquid crystal display. Since then, LCDs
have appeared in a wide range of consumer electronics including portable
computers.
The majority of portable PCs sold since the mid-1980s have come equipped
with LCDs in various guises, first in mono form but increasingly in colour -
driven by the success of software like Microsoft's Windows.
The most basic early machines had relatively simple 'passive matrix' LCDs
based on twisted nematic (TN) technology. That was fine for small screens,
but as the display size increases, the contrast between dark and light areas
declines.
One solution to this problem has been to increase the twisting effect and
thereby increase contrast. Thus manufactures have developed 'super twisted'
nematic displays (STN), 'double super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays in
which two STN cells are used and even 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN)
displays which use a refracting polymer film applied to the STN cell,
allowing thinner displays with higher contrast.
Another increasingly pop- ular option which improves the quality of
lower-price passive colour screens is 'double scanning'. A double scan LCD
updates the image twice as fast as the normal rate for passive LCDs,
generating deeper colours and brighter images.
But despite these improvements, 'passive' LCD technology still has some
shortcomings. Among these, the contrast is still insufficient to reproduce
the full range of colours available with a conventional CRT, and passive
LCDs have relatively slow response times which mean that moving images tend
to blur and leave shadows.
These limitations are overcome in another form of LCD by using 'active
matrix' thin film transistor (TFT) technology which boosts contrast and
response time by adding a transistor 'switch' to each LCD cell or 'pixel'.
Most of the colour notebook computers sold today feature active-matrix TFT
displays produced in Japan by a small group of manufacturers.
However, building 10-inch active-matrix TFT display is an extremely complex
and costly process involving over 100 steps spread out over a period of four
weeks. Active-matrix screen consists of 10 to 15 layers of material and
involves etching around 4m components.
A single dust particle can wreck a whole display and analysts suggest that,
despite precautions, more than half the manufactured display panels have to
be rejected because of flaws. But as manufacturing yields improve and more
Japanese manuf- acturing plants come on stream, the price of active- matrix
TFT screens is beginning to fall.
Two other flat screen tech- nologies, gas plasma and electroluminescence,
are also in use. Unlike LCDs, which need back or side lighting, gas plasma
screens generate their own light. In addition, res- ponse times are fast and
the price of gas plasma portables is lower than that of active mat- rix
systems. Electrolumin- escence screens are also fast, can support very high
resol- utions and are cheaper than TFT displays, but they tend to be
power-hungry.
Display manufacturers have therefore been investigating other new
technologies including ferro-electric LCDs and metal-insulator-metal
screens. In MIM displays, a layer of insulator is sand- wiched between two
layers of metal. They provide high contrast and may eventually be cheaper
than TFT machines. However, mass production techniques for MIM displays have
yet to be devised.
Some industry analysts and manufacturers believe that in the longer term
ferro-electric LCDs, pioneered by CRL, part of the British Thorn-EMI group,
and Canon in Japan, offer the most promise. FLCDs use a different type of
liquid crystal which reacts more quickly and, most importantly, is
bi-stable. This means that once a pixel is switched on (or off) it stays
like that until it receives another signal.
As a result, they do not need continuous power to maintain an image and,
because only those parts of the screen that have changed need to be updated,
battery life is increased by 20 times or more. FLCDs are also lighter,
brighter, have a wider viewing angle and are cheaper than TFT screens.
But they do have some disadvantages. In particular, today's ferro-electric
displays do not produce as wide a range of grey tones as most active- matrix
LCDs. Even more critic- ally, ferro-electric crystals are sensitive to shock
which has made it difficult to develop a practical FLCD, although CRL and
Canon claim to have overcome this problem.
Despite all these new developments, it may be too soon to write off the old
cathode ray tube. For example, last year Matsushita Electric Industrial
announced that it had managed to do away with both the conventional guns and
the magnetic coils that make current CRT tubes so deep. The result is a flat
CRT screen less than four inches thick. Such technology could potentially
lead to the re-introduction of the cathode ray tube into the portable
computer market.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (2): Leaders emerge in notebook
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'clam-shell' notebook computer has become the de facto standard for
portable computing in the 1990s, an important business tool and one of the
fastest-growing segments of the world computer market, writes Paul Taylor.
The success of notebook computers stems from advances in silicon integration
and other technological developments. As a result, PC manufacturers can pack
most, if not all, of the processing power of a desktop computer into
lightweight A4-size packages.
Low-power chips, together with improvements in screen and battery
technology, have enabled engineers to build machines with brighter displays
and longer battery lives while new lightweight miniaturised components such
as high capacity hard disks deliver full desktop functionality. While many
notebook machines are still based on Intel's 386 processor, machines built
around the more powerful Intel 486 processor are catching up fast.
Over the past few years, notebook computer sales have shown dramatic growth
as customers looked to them to provide fully functional computing power on
the move while computer manufacturers dived into the notebook market to
bolster sagging margins.
According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, notebook shipments
in Europe jumped by 27 per cent between the 1992 first half and the
corresponding period last year. Mr Jeffrey Goldberg, a Dataquest analyst,
says the notebook market is 'settling down', although he expects 'very good
growth' this year.
As it matures, some clear leaders have emerged in the notebook market while
second-tier manufacturers face an increasingly tough battle. One of the most
striking features revealed by Dataquest's quarterly figures over the past
two years has been the resurgence of Compaq.
The US computer manufacturer has overtaken Toshiba to claim the No 1 vendor
slot and has been building up significant lead - even though Toshiba has
been expanding its market share. Dataquest's 1993 third quarter figures for
Europe show Compaq with a 25.5 per cent of the market compared with
Toshiba's 18.6 per cent.
Aside from the success of Compaq's Conturas range of notebook computers, Mr
Goldberg suggests the US group has benefited from the preference of
corporate buyers in particular to source all their machines from the same
supplier - something Toshiba, which lacks desktop machines from its product
portfolio, cannot match.
Lower component prices and fierce competition have sent most notebook prices
tumbling and have markedly reduced the price premium commanded by notebooks
over their desktop counterparts.
Eighteen months ago, a typical notebook with an Intel 386 processor, 2Mb of
Ram and a 60Mb hard disk cost around Pounds 2,000 in the UK. Now, a more
powerful machine based on Intel's 486SX processor with 4Mb of Ram, an 80Mb
hard disk and a tracker-ball for mouse-style pointing under Microsoft
Windows can be bought for less than Pounds 1,000.
Top-of-the-range models cost considerably more but these have
state-of-the-art colour displays and other features such as PCMIA card slots
to connect modems for data communication.
Indeed, one of the main changes since 1992 identified by Dataquest's Mr
Goldberg is the growing 'stratification' of the notebook market. 'People are
buying at the top or bottom ends of product ranges,' he notes. Corporate
buyers in particular tend to buy top specified machines while individual
buyers go for cheaper, more basic models.
Mr Lewis Schrock, Compaq's UK product marketing manager, argues that the
growing fragmentation of the market 'means you are going to see a wide range
of machines targeted at different segments of the market'. In particular, he
believes manufacturers will produce broad 'families' of products built
around a modular design, or emphasise 'different prioritised feature sets'
such as useability, ease of mobility or upgradability.
Some manufacturers including Elonex, AST and Olivetti are already producing
highly modular and upgradable machines with interchangable components for
screens, processors and hard drives which they argue enable customers to
keep up with future technologies and provide users who share machines with
additional flexibility.
Other manufacturers have targeted specific machines at niche applications.
For example, Toshiba's T6600C portable includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo
speakers, detachable keyboard and other facilities to make multimedia
presentations while travelling while Canon's BN22 BJ notebook computer
incorporates a bubble jet printer.
Many notebook computers are second machines, used by people on the move who
also have desktop machines in the office. But a growing number are being
used as desktop replacements. Some manufacturers have taken this dual
function concept a stage further, developing 'docking stations'. These
enable the portable to take advantage of such facilities as full-size
screens and keyboards and connect to an office local area network.
Another innovation in portable computing over the past couple of years has
been the arrival of pen-based 'notepad' systems. Some manufacturers have
sought to combine the benefits of pen systems with the attractions of the
conventional keyboard. For example, AST's Grid Convertible has both keyboard
and penpad and Compaq has launched the Concerto, a high performance notebook
with a detachable screen which doubles as a pen pad.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (1): The portable revolution -

and suppliers are enthusiastic about the potential of the market

Competitors in the Whitbread Round The World yacht race, now in Auckland
preparing for the fourth leg of their 32,000-mile journey, can attest to the
power of portable computing.
Every boat in the race is fitted with a notebook PC as the terminal for its
satellite-based communications system. Information - weather data, for
example - can be transmitted and received from anywhere in the world. The
computers automatically transmit daily reports on each yacht's location,
direction and speed to the race office in Southampton.
Appropriately enough, the maker of the notebooks, Toshiba of Japan, is
sponsoring one of the leading boats.
Electronic notebooks are light, robust and reliable enough to withstand the
rigours of an ocean-going yacht race. That is powerful testimony to the way
that portable computers have matured in the past few years. There is still,
however, a long way to go. Power is still the biggest drawback. Even with
the most advanced chemical technology and the best power management systems,
battery life is only a few hours and the machines are too heavy for comfort.
Remarkable computing power can be shoehorned into a notebook. Tadpole
Technology, a UK-based electronics group, has managed to build a notebook
computer with the power of a Sun workstation. It has designed a notebook
workstation for IBM which will be launched soon and is likely to develop
notebook workstations for other US manufacturers.
Today, notebooks have for the most part displaced the larger, heavier laptop
machines as the portable computers of choice. 1994 seems set to be the year
of the subnotebook computer as manufacturers compress powerful systems into
pocket-sized packages and their customers devise new ways of computing on
the move.
The portable revolution is being driven by the needs of business. Over 90
per cent of the UK's larger companies already use portables to some degree.
For some companies they are simply small, light substitutes for desktop
machines. But for most, they have become an indispensable tool for field
workers - salespeople, inspectors and engineers.
(Inevitably, the backlash has started. Some people worry that portables
could become the computer equivalent of an 'electric fork', an unkind term
for an gadget that works as well whether the power is on or off. They argue
that glitzy technology is no substitute for old-fashioned business
discipline.)
What counts as a portable computer? Definitions can often seem to be mere
semantics as the lines between categories blur, but there are at least four
distinct kinds.
1: Notebooks. Battery or mains powered, these are typically the size of a
sheet of A4 notepaper and weigh less than three kilogrammes. They have
full-sized, backlit displays and full-sized keyboards and at least 80
megabytes of hard disk storage. A further refinement may be a 'docking
station' which converts the notebook into a desktop system. Most PC
manufacturers now offer a range of notebooks with proprietary features to
distinguish them from the competition. IBM, for example, eschews
conventional mouse or trackerball systems in favour of a keyboard mounted
strain gauge - 'Trackpoint' - for cursor control.
2: Subnotebooks. Again, these are battery or mains powered. They are the
size of a paperback book and weigh a kilogramme or so. Subnotebooks are
already available from, for example, Olivetti of Italy and Tulip of Holland.
They have back-lit displays, adequate if tiny keyboards and are capable of
running the latest version of Microsoft's Windows. Olivetti's Quaderno has a
digital sound recorder built in.
3: Palmtops. These - for instance Hewlett-Packard's 100LX or the Psion
Series 3 - are described as 'unconsciously portable' and are small enough
for a user to carry at all times. The HP machine is preloaded with Lotus
1-2-3 which can be called up at the press of a button.
4: Personal digital assistants. This is a new category, which includes the
Apple Newton, the EO 440 and the IBM Simon, handheld devices which combine
computing power with communications capabilities.
Suppliers are enthusiastic about the potential of the market. Mr Nick Eades,
IBM UK's brand manager for portable computing, says that growth in the
portable market has been 'phenomenal' this year. Mr Lewis Schrock, Compaq's
director of product marketing, foresees an explosion of different categories
of machine as the market fragments.
1993 was not a bonus year for every PC maker, however. Dell Computer, a
pioneer of direct marketing and the third largest US personal computer
maker, recorded its first ever quarterly loss after being forced to abandon
a poorly conceived line of notebook PCs.
Mr Glenn Henry, Dell's former chief technologist, said the abandoned range
was simply not competitive. Dell had not thought through its mobile
computing strategy, he said. The company has now formed an alliance with
Sony of Japan and is expected to return to the portable market with
competitive products this year.
Calculating the size and growth rates of the global market for portable
computers is difficult. It is a comparatively new market and the principal
market research companies are still analysing their figures for 1993. There
is little doubt that overall world shipments in 1993 came to about 6m units,
3m in the US and 1.5m each in Europe and Japan.
Mr Bruce Stephen, of the US-based company IDC, says preliminary worldwide
indications are that Toshiba and Compaq are running neck and neck for first
place in portable computers, with Apple Computer in third place. Toshiba and
Compaq both use MS/DOS and Windows as their operating system, while Apple
continues to use its own, unique System 7.
Compaq was the the market pioneer for portable computers in the 1980s, but
was slow in following Toshiba into the notebook sector.
The absolute numbers, however, are not as important as the growth prospects
(four desktop computers were sold for every portable last year). Worldwide,
growth in notebooks and subnotebooks in 1994 is expected to be 20-25 per
cent, well ahead of the 6 per cent or so expected for the computer industry
as a whole.
The significance of the sector is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that
technology developed for portables is beginning to make its appearance in
desktop machines.
Examples include power management and PCMCIA cards. Batteries based on
lithium technology can give twice the power for the same weight but portable
computers are power-hungry. Smart software has been devised to minimise
power requirements, essentially by turning off parts of the computer that
are not active.
Exactly the same technology can be used in desktop machines to reduce power
consumption and give a more environmentally friendly or 'green' system. A
few watts of power saved per machine can add up when a company with several
thousand PCs leaves then on continuously.
PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card Manufacturers International
Association) cards are the size of a credit card and can be slipped into any
computer with a PCMCIA slot. They offer the functions of network adaptors,
modems and disk drives. It is possible, for example, to build a 1.8 inch 340
megabyte hard disk drive into a PCMCIA card.
Some argue that the establishment of the PCMCIA standard will prove as
important to portable computing as IBM's PC design was to the desktop
computer business.

FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil price revisions hit shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON

<TEXT>
A powerful combination of Kleinwort Benson, Nomura and Hoare Govett wrought
substantial damage in the oil sector. Kleinwort set the ball rolling,
cutting its forecast of average oil prices for 1994 from Dollars 17 a barrel
to Dollars 14: analyst Mr Paul Spedding cited 'Opec's inaction to remedy
over-production' for the downgrade.
Kleinwort accompanied its oil price forecast shift with a reiteration of its
bearish stance on Shell Transport, 11 weaker at 726p, while maintaining its
stance on British Petroleum as a 'hold'. The latter settled 6 off at 368 1/2
p.
The broker also downgraded its asset values for the exploration and
production stocks, but declined to give details. Nomura and Hoare were seen
by marketmakers as triggering a drop in Enterprise Oil shares of 13 to 463p
in keen turnover of 3.4m.
Nomura expects the shares to underperform and the dividend to come under
threat in 1994/95 without a sustained rise in crude oil prices. It also
anticipates that the market may be called on to purchase more Enterprise
equity as part of Elf Aquitaine's financial restructuring. Hoare Govett told
its clients to 'switch from Enterprise to BP to reduce upstream risk'.
Premier Consolidated eased a penny to 23 1/2 p after one institution sold a
block of 5m shares into the market at 22 1/2 p, most of which were
subsequently placed at 23 1/4 p.

FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Active selling, some of which was done through the use of sophisticated
derivative instruments, brought a sharp retreat but reduced volume in stock
index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
A strong opening for the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index at
3,494 seemed to indicate a firm session ahead. However, this was soon
undermined by selling from Salomon Brothers.
A host of other factors played a part in the day's decline. Aggressive
selling of the bund futures initiated a similar response in traders of
March, as did Tuesday's issuing of an OTC put option. US investment house
Goldman Sachs was also said to have issued a call and put warrant yesterday,
all of which dampened enthusiasm for the contract.
But it was the fall on Wall Street following poor US consumer confidence
figures that brought the sharpest decline of the day, sending March below
its recent support level of 3,460.
It closed at 3,448, down 30 from yesterday's close and at a 6-point discount
to its fair value premium to cash of about 7 points. Turnover at 9,721
contracts was one of the lowest in recent sessions.
The traded options sector was more buoyant and saw improved turnover of
46,833 lots, Volume in the FT-SE 100 option only showed a slight improvement
at 12,921 contracts.
Better than expected results from international trading group Lonrho brought
increased activity to the group's stock options. They headed the list of
active stock trades, finishing with a total of 4,617 lots dealt.

FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Losses extended in modest selling
pressure - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unease over the economic outlook in the UK was fuelled yesterday by reports
that independent pay review bodies covering about 1.5m workers are about to
challenge the government's call for pay rises to be financed entirely from
productivity increases. UK stocks, having been unable to follow other
European markets higher in the morning, fell away sharply in the second half
of the session as Continental bond markets weakened.
By the close the FT-SE 100 Index was 37.4 down at 3,444. Some traders
believed they had seen some switching out of UK stocks and into German
equities, with futures markets paving the way for such moves. It was
noticeable that the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has recently outperformed the
FT-SE 100, came to heel yesterday and closed 9.8 off at 4,091.1.
Several trading programmes were identified, and at least one was weighted to
the sell side. But trading volume was not heavy, and many analysts remained
confident that the stock market was suffering little more than a technical
correction after its very successful post-Christmas run.
Weakness in oil shares, after a downgrading of crude oil price forecasts by
an influential London broking house, was an adverse factor. London was also
discouraged at the close by a fall of 17 Dow points in early dealings on
Wal1 Street as it reacted to IBM's trading statement.
Seaq volume increased in the final two hours of trading to return a total
for the day of 984.9m shares. On Monday 800.2m shares were worth Pounds
1.42bn in retail worth, the lowest daily figure for a week, although still
satisfactory even by bull market standards.
Most market specialists remained confident on equity prospects, even though
it was agreed that a further correction was likely. 'The market could pull
back by another 40 to 50 points to the Footsie 3,400 area without suffering
too much strain,' said a leading dealer at one of the big US houses.
Technical specialists believe that the UK market had become mildly
overbought in the weeks after Christmas, and have been searching out
possible areas of weakness.
Share losses, although spread across the range of the market, were mostly of
modest proportions. In many sectors, there were signs that institutional
investors were shuffling their portfolios rather than taking cash out of the
market.
Stocks with Far Eastern involvement showed mixed movements, as Tokyo rallied
cautiously while Hong Kong remained easier. Traders expressed continued
doubts over the outlook for Hong Kong, and some UK based houses have turned
cautious again on the Tokyo market, reversing their recent change of stance.
The retail sector, awaiting further reports this week on the Christmas
trading, was also mixed, with some leading names beginning to attract buyers
at the end of the day. The retail area is still seen as a crucial indicator
of progress in the recovery of the domestic economy, and traders await this
week's statements from Burton and Next, two of the leading UK clothing
groups, with keen interest.
UK markets looked nervous at the close last night as they waited for the
batch of important global news due before the end of the week. In addition
to President Clinton's State of the Union Message, the markets face
statistics on US employment trends, money supply and gross domestic product.

FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM news, technical questions
hit Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday as jitters over the market's technical
conditions proved more compelling than a fresh batch of corporate results,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 17.45 down at 3,895.34 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 1.05 to 470.92. The American SE composite shed
2.78 to 480.59 and the Nasdaq composite fell 4.26 to 786.39. NYSE volume
came to 326m shares.
The market opened with a slight decline, but losses mounted steadily until
mid-afternoon, when the Dow bottomed out with a 22-point deficit and began
to retrace some ground.
Those issues most closely tied to the economic cycle have prospered in
recent weeks, but many were hit hard yesterday by profit-taking. Caterpillar
declined Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 98 5/8 , Boeing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
43, Allied Signal Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 and Bethlehem Steel
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 21 5/8 .
The negative sentiment reflected growing anxiety over the failure of the
broad market indices to keep pace with the Dow blue chip barometer, which is
heavily weighted towards the cyclicals. Analysts said the divergence might
be an indication that the bull market had gone past its peak.
Stocks drew scant support from the bond market or the day's economic news.
The benchmark 30-year government security was down  5/16 to 98 3/4 in late
trading.
Meanwhile, the Conference Board's January consumer confidence index, at
83.2, proved to be less bullish than forecast. The announcement of a 6.7 per
cent month-to-month rise in sales of existing single-family homes in
December was a more welcome development.
Shares in International Business Machines were highly volatile after the
company posted fourth-quarter earnings of 62 cents a share, in line with
expectations. At one point the stock had fallen nearly Dollars 3, after an
equivalent gain the previous day, but rebounded to close just Dollars  3/8
off at Dollars 58 1/4 after 10.1m shares traded.
Pharmaceutical issues were active, with health care reform expected to be a
central theme of President Bill Clinton's State of the Union speech
yesterday evening. Merck added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 35 5/8 after
reporting better than expected operating income. Mylan Laboratories, a
generic drug supplier which could benefit from health care reform, climbed
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24 3/8 in spite of flat earnings.
Among the Dow components, American Express rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 32
3/4 after revealing late on Monday plans to spin off its Lehman Brothers
investment banking subsidiary.
Trading in Cooper Industries, an electrical and automobile equipment
supplier, was briefly suspended after it said a 25 per cent fall in 1994
earnings was possible. When reactivated, the stock plummeted to Dollars 41
1/2 , down Dollars 10 on the day.
On the Nasdaq, technology issues remained out of favour.
Canada
Toronto shares continued to retreat in fairly active trading amid cautious
profit-taking.
The TSE 300 index closed 9.6 off at 4,456.2 and falls led rises by 439 to
360 after volume of 66.4m shares valued at CDollars 842m.

Mexican stocks reacted nervously to the decline of Telmex, the telephone
utility, in New York on news that Grupo Financiero Banacci and MCI
Communications had agreed to form a company which might offer long-distance
services in Mexico when the Telmex monopoly is broken up in late 1996. The
IPC index was off 33.81, or 1.26 per cent, at 2,659.90 at the close. Telmex
ADRs declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 3/4.

FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volatile Frankfurt changes
tack again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's weakness touched on bourses late in the day, but European
equities were losing their glitter before US markets opened, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reversed Monday's pattern, the Dax index building on previous
post-bourse gains to close the session 46.77 higher at 2,126.78, then losing
most of it in the afternoon where it ended at 2,090.78, leaving dealers
casting about for the reasons why.
There was talk of falling bund and Dax futures driving the cash market
lower, of disappointment with the Deutsche Bank dividend (DM16.50, against
an expected DM17, but still up DM1.50 on the year), and some mention of the
breakdown in pay talks for engineering workers in North Baden-Wurttemberg.
However, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in
Frankfurt, equities had been destabilised by a rise of over 90 points in the
Dax in just over 24 hours, following a drop of 232, or 10 per cent from
their 1993/94 high just three weeks earlier. 'The market took six months to
drop 13 per cent in 1984,' said Mr Benischek. 'It has been moving too fast -
both ways'.
Turnover eased from DM10.5bn to DM10bn. Deutsche Bank fell to DM791.00 after
hours, losing all and more of the DM20.30 gain to DM811.80 it recorded on
the official session. However, the metals, chemical and pharmaceutical
group, Degussa, closed DM6.50 higher at DM462 then continued climbing late
in the day to finish at DM468 although its drugs subsidiary, Asta Medica,
said that it would await further developments in the pharmaceutical industry
before it applied for a public listing.
PARIS retreated from mid-morning gains but overall activity remained muted
with many investors waiting for results from Bouygues (down FFr2 at FFr731)
due after the session had ended.
The CAC-40 index closed up 3.85 at 2,278.34, after a session high of
2,298.29.
Other stocks in the construction/building materials sector remained firm,
with St Gobain, which pleased the market with its results last week, putting
on FFr6 to FFr692, and Lafarge Coppee, due to report today, gaining FFr7.20
to FFr468.70.
UAP was marked down FFr20 to FFr630 after the sale of a 5 per cent stake at
FFr617 a share, indicating, some analysts commented, the price that the
insurer might set in its forthcoming privatisation.
In contrast LVMH, which was hit hard last week on news of a change in its
cross shareholding arrangement with Guinness, recovered FFr80 to FFr3,920 as
some buyers returned.
MADRID balanced the Bank of Spain's quarter-point interest rate cut against
later weakness on Wall Street, and came out with the general index 3.93, or
1.2 per cent higher 342.94 in turnover of Pta51bn.
Bank stocks reacted to the interest rate move, Bankinter rising by Pta800,
or 6.7 per cent to Pta12,750 and BBV by Pta90, or nearly 3 per cent to
Pta3,100.
MILAN gained ground on signs that the country's centre parties may be moving
towards co-operation. The Comit index ended the day up 7.31 or 1.2 per cent
at 625.21, with screen trading closing at a record L887bn.
AMSTERDAM was moderately lower with declines in heavyweight stocks weighing
on sentiment. The AEX index lost 3.46 to 426.29, after an earlier high of
431.20.
STOCKHOLM dropped 1.6 per cent after Goldman Sazchs downgraded Ericsson in
New York, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 24.70 lower at 1,525.80.
Ericsson B dropped SKr23, or 6.1 per cent to SKr353.
WARSAW broke through the 16,000 level with sentiment boosted by the listing
of Bank Slaski, the market's biggest ever issue. The WIG index advanced
962.5 or 6.1 per cent to 16,808.8 in high turnover of 2,900bn zlotys.
Bank Slaski closed at 6.75m zlotys or 13.5 times the issue price.
ISTANBUL lost a further 6.3 per cent, bringing its losses for the last three
days to 16 per cent. The composite index shed 1,533.53 to 22,727.21 as
investors remained nervous because of the weakness of the currency against
the US dollar in the money markets. The market's recent correction compares
with a 400 per cent gain in 1993 and Carnegie International, in London, said
that any sign of stability returning to the money markets could well trigger
a wave of fresh buying.
ATHENS lost 3 per cent as profit-taking continued. The general index shed
33.34 to 1,143.49 in volume of 3.8m shares.

FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average firmer on
foreign buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed hopes of economic stimulus supported sentiment, and share prices
firmed amid thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei average gained 295.12, or 1.6 per cent, at 18,648.36 on
active buying by overseas investors. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rebounded 20.32 to 1,519.38, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 3.11 to 1,257.48.
The Nikkei opened at an intraday low of 18,427.44 and gained ground on
steady demand from foreign investors. Arbitrageurs were also seen buying in
small lots after the Liberal Democratic party, the leading opposition group,
accepted the coalition's proposal to discuss the setting up of a
parliamentary joint committee, and the index hit a high of 18,662.27 in the
last few minutes of trading.
Although an agreement before Saturday, the deadline for the reform bill,
seems to be unlikely, some investors expect Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime
minister, to announce economic support before any other political decision
is reached. Volume amounted to 280m shares, with gainers leading losers by
852 to 184, with 98 issues unchanged.
Leading stocks recovered ground, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
advancing Y9,000 to Y849,000 and East Japan Railway firming Y12,000 to
Y473,000.
Reports of a business tie-up boosted Honshu Paper by Y16 to Y571 and
Takasaki Paper Y44 to Y291. The companies announced that they will share
distribution and purchasing networks.
Foreign investors bought construction companies, which have been laggards
recently because of the spate of bribery scandals involving the sector.
Obayashi rose Y13 to Y628 and Sato Kogyo gained Y24 at Y790. Real estate
companies were also higher, with Mitsubishi Estate ahead Y48 at Y1,020.
Banks, which had been battered on Monday, recouped their losses. Industrial
Bank of Japan rose Y70 to Y3,150 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moved up Y30 to
Y1,890.
Profit-taking by corporations ahead of the March book closing hurt some
retailers. Ito-Yokado, the supermarket chain, receded Y30 to Y5,170.
Hokuetsu Bank, a regional bank, slipped Y7 to Y552 on corporate selling.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 200.66 to 20,401.22 in volume of 57.7m
shares. Roundup
Local issues affected the region's markets yesterday.
KUALA LUMPUR tumbled 4.5 per cent on renewed worries over forthcoming
provincial elections, and further unwinding of positions following the
market's year-end rally. The composite index shed 50.53 to 1,014.02.
Some analysts also pointed to the fact that excess liquidity was being
drained by two large public share offers which are coming up: Petronas
Dagang, the retail arm of Petronas, the oil group, and Hicom, the state
industrial company.
SINGAPORE went down a further 2.7 per cent as sentiment was affected by the
sharp fall in Malaysia. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 62.22
weaker at 2,256.05.
HONG KONG closed lower, pressured by late weakness on the futures market,
after a day of seesaw trading, brokers said.
The Hang Seng index lost 109.15, or nearly 1 per cent, to 11,490.94 in
HKDollars 8.5bn turnover.
Hutchison Whampoa put on 25 cents at HKDollars 41.25 after stating that it
was raising its stake in Hong Kong International Terminals to 77.5 per cent.
Property companies fell steadily on profit-taking after recent strong gains.
Cheung Kong lost 50 cents to HKDollars 48.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 66.50 and HK Land 30 cents to HKDollars 27.70.
Banks were also depressed, with HSBC Holdings retreating HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 115 and Hang Seng Bank surrendering HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars
72.50.
BOMBAY saw solid buying by foreign institutions, particularly from the US,
lift equities by more than 3 per cent, and the BSE index gained 123.52 at
3,978.96.
Power companies were favoured, with Tata Power rising Rp170 to Rp2,140.
Elsewhere, Associated Cement moved forward Rp45 to Rp3,270 and Tata Iron and

FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Karachi equities wobble after doubling
in value - The Pakistani equity debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani equities hit trouble a little later than their counterparts
further east this year, but they finally succumbed with large-scale losses
in the three days ending on Monday, when the KSE index dropped by some 248
points, or 10 per cent, to 2,202.21.
Brokers and market analysts termed this a 'technical correction', predicting
that the KSE's three-month rally would regain its momentum, although on
'Black Sunday', January 23, the index lost a record 129 points, roughly 5.5
per cent, on the day. Their confidence seemed borne out yesterday when the
index recovered 77.52 to 2,279.57 as domestic institutional, and later
general support, outweighed the caution of foreign funds.
By the middle of last week a combination of factors, including political
stability in the country, continued interest from foreign buyers and growing
profitability in some sectors, had helped the market more than double in
value since April last year.
The rate of climb accelerated spectacularly following the October election
of Ms Benazir Bhutto as prime minister. The index, 1,369.61 before the
October 6 polls, took off after the election results were announced, in
anticipation of the return of political stability following a year of
turmoil.
The subsequent election, in November, of Mr Farooq Leghari as president
strengthened the government's hand further, as Mr Leghari had served as a
loyal lieutenant of Ms Bhutto before coming to office.
Aside from political factors, continued foreign interest has attracted new
investors. A recently launched Dollars 60m Pakistan fund from Morgan Stanley
has been oversubscribed, attracting subscriptions worth Dollars 187m.
The Karachi equity market seemed tailormade to accommodate the explosion of
US and other international investment interest in emerging markets last
year, particularly in the final quarter, as speculators looking for quick
profits vied with fund managers concerned, in some cases belatedly, to show
a good spread of foreign equities in their portfolios.
'Pakistan is a very open market for investors as opposed to other countries.
Here, there are no restrictions,' says Mr Farrukh Khan, a broker at BMA
Capital Management. Foreign investors have complete freedom to invest in
stocks, and fully to repatriate capital as well as profits. There are,
moreover, no taxes on capital gains. Foreign investors held stocks worth
approximately Dollars 700m before the latest falls, some brokers said in
their estimates.
Mr Aslam Motiwala, another broker, expects continued buying interest in the
year ahead. Pharmaceuticals, banking and other financial stocks, chemicals
and the energy sector are expected to be among the strongest performers, he
adds.
Areas of concern include textile shares, widely expected to be among the
largest losers this year due to the severe shortfall in the Pakistani cotton
crop, and the consequent rise in prices of raw material. Almost one-third of
the 652 companies listed on the KSE represent textiles, and their
profitability affects the market's trend.
The APTMA (All Pakistan Textile Manufacturers Association), the largest
association representing the industry, claims that at least 1.2m spindles
out of a total of 6.5m have shut down during the past year due to continuing
losses, while at least half a million more are at the risk of closure.
Partly due to the cotton crisis, the government has been forced to lower its
annual economic growth rate target from 7.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Although other crucial macroeconomic performance estimates such as the
balance of trade and foreign exchange reserves have improved, the lowering
of growth targets has created some worries over this year's economic
performance, and its effects on business opportunities for companies
registered on the market.
Accordingly, opinion on the market's prospects cuts both ways. Many
analysts, concerned with the break in the uptrend, alsoworry that fresh
signs of political uncertainty could reverse the KSE rally.
Since 1988, three governments have been forced to leave office without
completing their terms. Although Ms Bhutto's government appears to be
stable, some analysts fear the prospect of fresh political infighting, which
could eventually leave her in a similar position.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Rate reductions in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading currencies took a back seat yesterday as interest shifted to Spain
and Belgium, which both announced rate cuts, writes Philip Gawith.
The weakness of the D-Mark provided a favourable environment for other
European countries to reduce borrowing costs. Both the Belgian franc and
Spanish peseta appreciated against the D-Mark after announcing official rate
cuts.
Analysts yesterday agreed that the two rate cuts formed part of a continuing
pattern for countries across Europe to chip away at interest rates without a
Bundesbank lead.
They lent further support to the view that currency movements, especially
within the ERM, are now more a reflection of economic fundamentals than
interest rate differentials.
The Belgian franc ended against the D-Mark yesterday at BFr20.69, up from
Monday's close of BFr20.81, as the market welcomed a 10 basis-point cut in
the central rate to 7 per cent.
Dealers said that last Friday's resignation of three socialist politicians
following a corruption scandal, and the weekend cabinet reshuffle, had
calmed the markets, giving the Belgian National Bank room for a rate cut.
Currency and money market dealers said the central bank had room to reduce
rates further, but were likely to act cautiously. Apart from lowering its
key central rate, the bank cut its overnight lending rate to other banks to
8.6 per cent from 8.7 per cent. The rate changes - the second this month -
took immediate effect.
Analysts said Belgian short-term interest rates were still much higher than
in neighbouring countries. The three-month short-term rate spread over
Germany is currently at about 100 basis points compared with zero or even
slightly below German rates before the near collapse of the ERM last summer.
The performance of the peseta after the rate cut underlined the weak
sentiment towards the D-Mark. The D-Mark traded at 81.4 pesetas before the
cut, but fell to finish at 80.94 pesetas. The German currency lost ground
across the board on the crosses in Europe, reflecting continuing speculation
of a near-term cut in German rates, said traders.
Inflation figures from Baden-Wuerttemburg of 3.6 per cent, down from 4.0 per
cent, reinforced the view that overall German inflation figures, expected
Friday, will provide the Bundesbank with enough reason to relax German
monetary policy.
Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said the market was currently
reflecting a shift in sentiment against the D-Mark rather than being driven
by any hard news. 'The Bundesbank is not convincing anyone of its ability to
underpin the currency.' Mr Parsons said the 'general disenchantment' with
the Bundesbank was shown by the fact that the dollar was again approaching
the DM1.7565 level, the high reached on January 18. The dollar closed in
London at DM1.7528, up from DM1.7504.
Mr Parsons added: 'The Bundesbank is fighting old battles. It should be
fighting the growth battle, not the interest rate battle.' However, Mr
Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank deputy president, yesterday underlined
that the Bundesbank would cut its leading interest rates further only when
key economic trends are in line with its goals. Speaking at Bochum
University in Germany, he said: 'If the data position - and that means the
money supply in particular - develops in conformity with our goals, we will
undertake further interest rate cuts.'
The US currency had another quiet day in Europe, dealers reporting minimal
turnover and a marked lack of interest. The US Conference Board's consumer
confidence index rose in January to 83.2 per cent, slightly lower than
market expectations, but still stronger than any reading in 1993. Analysts
said it augured well for consumer spending in the months ahead.
The dollar opened slightly higher in New York against the D-Mark, but softer
against the yen. The Japanese currency was under less pressure than during
the past two trading sessions. Dealers said the yen had obtained support
from reports that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had persuaded his
opponents to discuss a compromise package of political reform measures. The
yen closed in London at Y111.155 per dollar, up from Monday's Y111.825. New
York trading ended with the dollar at DM1.7483 and Y110.93.
Sterling had a quiet day, finishing slightly easier in London against the
dollar at Dollars 1.494, from Dollars 1.496 on Monday. It rose fractionally
against the D-Mark to DM2.6187 from a previous DM2.6185. The pound was still
unaffected by the political row over higher taxes in Britain.
Meanwhile, in a written parliamentary answer Mr Anthony Nelson, economic
secretary to the Treasury, ruled out sterling's return to the ERM during the
current parliament. 'Sterling's re-entry to the ERM could not be considered
until there is greater convergence between the monetary policies appropriate
for all the community economies,' he said.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with around Pounds 40m
sterling of unspecified late assistance, bringing total help for the day to
Pounds 1.615bn. This compared with its forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds
1.7bn. In its early operations the Bank bought Pounds 1.3bn of bills at the
established repo rate of 5 13/32 . It provided Pounds 275m in normal
operations at 5 3/8 per cent.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India struggles to cover
shortfall in jute crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian jute mill industry is trying to organise the import of fibre from
all possible sources in a desperate attempt to improve the supply of raw
jute.
According to traders, Indian mills have so far been able to buy nearly
250,000 bales (180kg each) from Bangladesh. But as that country suffered a
major setback in jute production this season it is not in a position to meet
the full Indian import requirement.
The Indian mills are, therefore, exploring the non-traditional markets like
Vietnam and China, according to industry officials.
One mill has already imported 15,000 quintals (equivalent to about 3,800
bales) of jute from Vietnam and says that further imports will be made from
that source provided that 'the quality of the first lot is found
satisfactory'.
'We have received quotations for the Chinese jute from some Singapore-based
traders,' it adds.
'The Chinese jute, which is equivalent to our benchmark grade TD-5, has been
offered at about Rs220 (Pounds 4.70) a quintal higher than the prevailing
Indian price. The mills have to decide whether it is desirable to import
Chinese jute at the rate of Dollars 34 a quintal,' says an Indian Jute Mills
Association official.
The fact remains, however, that neither Vietnam nor China has much surplus
jute for export.
The Indians have drawn a blank in Thailand which has itself become a jute
importer. But they will be able to buy some fibre from Nepal, according to
industry officials.
Federal government officials now admit that the agriculture ministry was
wide of the mark in August when it made a jute crop estimate of 7.4m bales
for the 1993-94 season (July to June). According to Mr SS Chattopadhyay,
jute commissioner, 'the crop in the current season could turn out to be less
than 6.5m bales.'
The trade maintains, however, that the crop is not more than 6.2m bales.
Last season India produced 7.4m bales of jute.
Because of the crop failure, the prices of raw jute, particularly of the
better varieties, have hardened considerably. The TD-5 grade is quoted at
about Rs840 a quintal, compared with Rs440 in January last year and Rs619 at
the commencement of this season.
According to the IJMA, which has estimated a crop of 6.5m bales, total
availability of fibre during 1993-94 will be 8.66m bales, including opening
stocks of 1.86m bales and imports of 300,000 bales. But as annual
consumption of fibre by the mills is about 8m bales and the non-mill
requirement about 550,000 bales, end-season stocks will be insignificant.
The Indian jute season begins in July, but the crop arrivals do not start
gaining momentum until about the middle of September.
'The industry faces a big crisis whenever the opening stocks are less than
1.8m bales', say industry officials. According to IJMA officials, about 24
of the country's 73 mills have 'very low stocks of jute'.
The growers have already sold their jute and, anticipating a further rise in
prices, the middlemen have cornered a good quantity of fibre. So the weaker
mills, which constitute the greater part of the industry, are finding it
increasingly difficult to buy jute at the current prices.
According to the industry officials, the jute commissioner will soon be
required to invoke his powers under the jute control order to fix the
maximum prices of fibre, put a limit to the stocks of jute that a mill may
maintain and also regulate the industry's production. Otherwise, as has been
seen in the past years of crop failures, there will a random closure of
mills.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central Americans boost coffee
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central American coffee officials hope their decision to set a minimum
export price of 80 cents a pound, fob, will add a more aggressive edge to
the 20 per cent export retention plan already in place.
The move, agreed last Friday at a meeting in Guatemala City, followed a
similar decision by neighbouring Colombia, the world's second biggest coffee
producer after Brazil. Colombia's minium export price is set at 92 cents a
pound.
Under the retention plan adopted by the world's major coffee exporters on
October 1, 20 per cent of arabica coffee is withheld from the export market
while the International Coffee Organisation's composite indicator price
remains under 75 cents a pound.
The Guatemala City meeting which was attended by officials from Colombia and
from other Central American countries, was called to assess progress on the
retention plan, which was introduced at the beginning of the 1993-94 coffee
year.
In a bullish mood delegates said that all the countries present, which
represented the bulk of the world's arabica exports, were complying with the
retention scheme, the effect of which would soon begin to be felt in the
market.
'The plan is meeting its objective,' said Mr Herbert de Sola, El Salvador's
chief coffee negotiator. 'In three months consumer stocks have dropped by 4m
bags (60kg each).'
In the three months from October 1, Central American exports reached 1.1m
bags, with a further 250,000 bags retained in bonded warehouses in the
region, he said.
According to Mr Rene Montes, Guatemala's ambassador to the International
Coffee Organisation, the preliminary estimate of Central America's
exportable crop for this year was 8.5m bags, down sharply from the 11.8m
bags exported in 1992-93. But the final export figure would be under 7m bags
if retention was applied at 20 per cent throughout the year.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australians welcome Chinese
decision to cut wool tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China is understood to have decided to reduce the tariff on Australian shorn
greasy wool from 15 to 10 per cent - the second concession the country has
made to the Australian wool industry in recent months.
The decision has not yet been formally announced in Beijing, but is likely
to be part of series of tariff measures unveiled by the Chinese government
next month. However, the decision - effective from January 1 and 'in
recognition of the exchange rate effects of the recent float of the Chinese
currency' - has become common knowledge and was formally welcomed yesterday
by the Australian trade and primary industries ministries.
In November, China agreed to reduce the tariff on Australia processed wool
from 20 to 15 per cent. The latest move will be subject to review in 12
months time. Yesterday, Australian government officials described the latest
move as 'another step in the right direction' and said that they would press
for further tariff breaks.
China has become an extremely important market for the beleaguered
Australian wool industry. In the first 10 months of 1992-3, the country was
the largest single importer of Australian wool, with volumes rising by some
60 per cent of their equivalent levels in the previous year. Top-level
discussions aimed at securing tariff reductions have been under way for
several months.

FT  26 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa gains trimmed - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A late bout of selling trimmed back COCOA prices yesterday after another
abortive attempt to break through upside resistance.
'The market may yet move higher,' said one trader, 'but at the moment it
doesn't seem to have any real life to it.'
Selling from one US trade house in particular was noted as the London
Commodity Exchange's May futures position retreated from its early peak of
Pounds 924 a tonne to close at Dollars 916, up Dollars 4 on the day.
The COFFEE market had made a promising beginning, the March breaking through
initial resistance at Dollars 1,200 a tonne, in buying possibly linked to
interest from some of the smaller funds, traders said. But profit taking
eroded the gains and by the close the price was down Dollars 8 on the day at
Dollars 1,184 a tonne.
At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM was helped by late commission house
buying, encouraged by underlying support above Dollars 1,200 a tonne for
three moths metal. The market was also aided by caution ahead of Friday's
deadline for producing nations to agree a pact on curbing production. Final
business was at Dollars 1,210, up Dollars 17.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rises forecast for lead
and zinc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zinc and lead prices are forecast to climb back fairly strongly in 1994 from
their extremely depressed current levels, but will probably turn down again
in 1996-97 and then remain flat into the next century.
According to the Australian Mineral Economic research consultancy, the price
of lead could average about USDollars 600 a tonne in 1994, compared with
USDollars 405 a tonne in 1993. 'Supplies of lead in concentrate, which are
extremely tight, will remain so until 1995, forcing metal inventories to
reduce to 'normal' levels in 1994,' it says. 'In these circumstances, it
must be predicted that lead prices will first overshoot 'normal' levels,
within the coming 12 months.'
However, the forecasters go on to note that the lead price usually
experiences short peaks and long slumps, and say that they expect a return
to 'slump conditions' after 1995, when they predict that the price will
reach USDollars 800 a tonne. Between 1997 and the year 2005, they predict
that the price will range from USDollars 650 to USDollars 725 (at 1992
values).
On the zinc front, they suggest that 'the current shortage of zinc
concentrate stocks can be anticipated to bring about a reduction in both
metal production and stocks in 1994, thus providing the basis for prices to
return to viable levels'.
They predict that the zinc price will average about USDollars 1,125 a tonne
in 1994. It is forecast to peak at around USDollars 1,625 in 1996, and then
head downwards for the rest of the decade.
Australia's coal mines are being threatened by 24-hour 'stop work' meetings,
as workers consider the implications of prices cuts agreed between the
nation's coal producers and the Japanese steel mills.
Mr John Maitland, president of the United Miners Federation, said the
meetings would be held over two weeks starting from February 8, and would
lead to one-day closures at various mines.
BHP Australia Coal announced on Monday that its negotiations had resulted in
price cuts of around eight per cent, and that shipments would also be
curtailed. News of the outcome of the negotiations sent coal-related shares

Industries and Coal &amp; Allied among the companies affected.
Some analysts warned that the possibility of similar cuts to iron ore prices
was also compounding the market's worries.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Compromise reached on tropical
timber pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty tropical timber producing and consuming nations are due today to adopt
a new accord on timber trade and conservation after four rounds of arduous
negotiations spanning two years.
But the deal has failed to win the approval of conservationist pressure
groups.
The pact, which succeeds the 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement,
is expected to come into force in February 1995, for an initial period of
four years.
Success was finally achieved after the two sides reached a compromise on
producer demands that temperate timber as well as tropical timber should be
subject to the same forest preservation requirements. Under the pact, all
tropical timber exports are supposed to be extracted from sustainably
managed forests by the year 2000.
Consuming countries, which include the US, the European Union, Canada and
Russia, will issue a 'formal statement' pledging to respect comparable
conservation guidelines for their own forests. However, the statement is not
part of the new accord and is not legally binding.
Consumers have also agreed to set up a fund, known as the 'Bali Partnership
Fund', to aid producers in their efforts to meet forest conservation
objectives. No target figure for the fund is set in the draft agreement.
Environmental groups, concerned about the degradation of temperate forests,
have expressed disappointment that temperate and boreal woods are to be
excluded from the pact. The Dollars 7.5bn a year trade in tropical timber -
logs, plywood and veneer sheets - represents about 10 per cent of total
timber trade.
'Both producers and consumers agreed behind closed doors to a compromise
which will leave the world's forests as endangered as ever', the World Wide
Fund for Nature said on Monday.
The possible inclusion of timber from temperate and boreal forests in the
new agreement will come up for discussion again in 1999.
Negotiators suggested that producers were likely to be reluctant to renew
the pact if there was no clear movement by consumers towards sustainable
forest management by that time.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Weakness in Germany affects prices across
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sudden drop in German government bonds was yesterday attributed to factors
ranging from worries about the lack of progress at the IG Metall pay talks,
to a large sell order hitting a relatively thin market.
Union negotiators have warned that German employers could face a fierce
industrial dispute if they remain inflexible. The union has also threatened
token strikes later this month.
Earlier in the day, the market had found fleeting cheer in the release of
favourable January inflation data from the state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
The March bund future on Liffe rose as high as 100.21, but slumped to 99.79
in the late afternoon in good volume, down 0.34 point on the day.
The weakness in Germany spread to other government bond markets in Europe.
UK gilts fell by as much as  3/8 point at the long end in thin trading as
the market awaited the Bank of England's Pounds 2.75bn auction of 15-year
stock today. By contrast, gilts with shorter maturities found greater
protection, losing only around  1/16 point.
The March long gilt future on Liffe stood at 119 3/8 in late trading, down
13/32 on the day and off the day's high of 119 7/8 .
Italian government bonds were hit by the fall in Germany and by news that
the minimum accepted rate at the Bank of Italy's L7,000bn repurchase tender
for government securities rose to 8.65 per cent from 8.60 per cent at the
last operation on January 19.
The unexpected rise in short-term rates led traders to speculate that the
bank was seeking to build up the availability of funds in case of jitters in
the financial markets in the run-up to the general election in March.
The March future on Liffe went as high as 119.06, as traders sought to break
the previous record high of 119.12, before dropping back to 118.59 in the
late afternoon, a loss of 0.34 point on the day.
Danish government bonds were boosted in the morning by news that the Danish
finance ministry had reduced its estimate for Denmark's state budget deficit
for 1993 and 1994 to around or just below DKr50bn. In its last economic
forecast in December, the ministry had forecast budget shortfalls of
DKr51.7bn and DKr54.4bn for 1993 and 1994 respectively.
The 8 per cent state bond due 2003 stood a half-point higher at 113.95 by
the early afternoon, but later fell back due to weakness in German
government bonds.
Spanish government bonds bucked the weaker trend in Europe and rallied in
the wake of the Bank of Spain's unexpected cut in its money rate, to 8.75
per cent from 9 per cent. The market was also supported by the peseta's
strengthening after the rate cut. The yield on 10-year government bonds fell
to 7.74 per cent from 7.8 per cent.
Japanese government bond futures fell more than a point in Tokyo on fears
that the Japanese ministry of finance might increase the size of its monthly
auction, which is due to be held today. The auctions usually raise Y1,000bn,
but there was speculation that the ministry would increase the amount to
Y1,200bn.
The market was also undermined by the recovery in the stock market, which
traders said prompted some investors to switch short-term funds from bonds
into equities.
The March future fell to 114.80 at the close in Tokyo, down 1.15 points from
Monday's final level, and drifted to 114.58 in London trading.
Prices on longer-dated US bonds were weaker yesterday, but the short end
held steady as sufficient demand surfaced for the Treasury's auction of
Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/32 at 98
13/16 , with the yield rising to 6.334 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 5/16 , to yield 4.061 per cent.
At the beginning of the session, uncertainty over the market's ability to
absorb the fresh supply hit prices across the maturity range. However, the
short end soon rebounded and finished the day with little change after the
sale went smoothly. The bid-to-cover ratio - which measures bids tendered
and accepted - was 2.85, indicating fairly strong demand.
Most of the damage came at the long end. Misgivings about the pace of
economic recovery were stirred by news of a surge in sales of existing
single-family homes in December. A weaker-than-expected reading on consumer
confidence by the Conference Board failed to improve sentiment.
The market's next hurdle comes today, when the Treasury auctions Dollars
12bn in five-year notes. Many dealers were selling securities to lighten
inventories ahead of the sale.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Stream of issues in currency range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stream of Eurobond issues in various currencies emerged yesterday,
including a UK corporate issue in the Eurosterling market and the first
Danish krone convertible Eurobond.
Meanwhile, in the French domestic bond market, the French unemployment fund
Unedic issued the largest-ever domestic bond via Banque Paribas and Caisse
des Depots et Consignations.
The issue came in two tranches: a FFr10bn tranche maturing in October 1999
and a FFr12bn portion maturing in November 2002. The first tranche was
priced to yield 10 basis points over the interpolated French government bond
yield curve, while the second tranche came at a yield of 12 basis points
over the 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002.
'This paper offers added supply in maturities where there is little
liquidity in the OAT market,' said a syndicate manager at Paribas in Paris.
He said the short-dated tranche was sold out quickly, while placement of the
longer-dated tranche was slower.
The bonds are guaranteed by the French government. However, while they will
be traded by French government bond primary dealers, they are not
deliverable into the notional bond futures contract on the Matif.
In the afternoon, Salomon Brothers announced SKr1.5bn of 10-year bonds for
Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export financing agency. The bonds are expected
to be priced today at a yield spread of 24 basis points over the 10-year
Swedish government bond.
While the five- to seven-year sector of the Swedish krona bond market has
been flooded with new supply in the last two weeks, the 10-year sector has
not been tapped recently. And there is still good demand for Swedish krona
bonds from investors who expect Swedish interest rates to continue falling
and the currency to appreciate.
The UK healthcare and industrial group BOC was the second UK corporate
borrower this year to tap the Eurosterling market, issuing Pounds 125m of
10-year bonds via CS First Boston. The launch spread of 57 basis points over
gilts was deemed by most market participants to be too tight.
After the syndicate broke, the gap widened to more than 60 basis points.
However, the lead manager said it rebounded to around 59 basis points over
gilts towards the close.
In the Canadian dollar market, Abbey National Treasury Services issued
CDollars 200m of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 26 basis points over the
Canadian government bond at re-offer. The issue was widely criticised as
being too tightly priced.
An official at lead manager Salomon Brothers agreed the deal had been
aggressively priced, but argued that the Canadian dollar bond market has
recently seen little supply and strong investor demand. 'We haven't sold all
our bonds, but we feel comfortable about our ability to place them in the
next few days,' he said.
Elsewhere, the Danish food ingredients and packaging company Danisco
launched the first Danish krone convertible Eurobond, totalling DKr1bn of
10-year bonds. A syndicate official at lead manager S. G. Warburg said the
issue was heavily oversubscribed, with strong demand from Swiss and UK
institutional investors, and existing Danisco shareholders.
In the D-Mark sector, the price of LKB Baden-Wurttemberg's DM750m bond issue
launched on Monday slipped in line with the underlying bund market, but the
yield spread tightened slightly to around 66 basis points, from 67 the
previous day.
According to lead manager J. P. Morgan, the bonds traded as high as 100.90
on Monday. Yesterday they slipped to around 100.55 bid in late trade.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Baring drops Japan warrants
market role in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baring Securities in London has ceased making a market in Japanese equity
warrants, citing the increasing illiquidity of the sector.
The firm will continue to trade in Japanese warrants, and to make a market
in Japanese convertible bonds. Baring Securities in Tokyo will continue to
provide a broker/broker dealing arrangement (the equivalent of marketmaking)
in both equity warrants and convertibles.
Baring Securities was a leading participant in the thriving London-based
market for Japanese equity warrants in the late 1980s.
However, the weakness of the Japanese stock market in recent years, which
has left many Japanese equity warrants substantially out of the money, has
caused volume in London to tail off.
The rules for marketmakers set by the International Securities Market
Association (ISMA), the Eurobond market's regulatory body in the UK, have
become increasingly burdensome, a Baring official said.
For example, under the so-called 'knock-for-knock' rule, if a marketmaker
asks another marketmaker for a price, he then has to make one in return. He
suggested that a system of screen-based quotes, similar to the Tokyo market,
might be more suitable for the low level of trading in the sector.
The departure of Baring leaves only 12 marketmakers in London. Baring is
making four staff redundant as a result of the move.

US airline

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Frank Lorenzo, the former US airline chief, yesterday renewed his efforts
to re-enter the industry by bringing in a group of investors to back his
plans to launch a low-cost carrier serving the US east coast.
He announced that Odyssey Partners, a private New York investment firm, and
other private investors had agreed to put Dollars 12.5m into ATX, formed to
promote his venture. His own stake would be diluted to less than 25 per
cent.
He also said ATX had chosen Mr Stephen Berger, an Odyssey partner, as its
first chairman. He is a former executive director of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey.
For months Mr Lorenzo has been trying to win a licence to start up a
no-frills, low-fare airline serving the east coast. He says the carrier will
offer unrestricted fares of Dollars 69 on the Baltimore-Boston and
Washington-Boston routes, compared with the current average of Dollars 129.
However, he is strongly opposed by the airline unions because of the bitter
confrontations when Mr Lorenzo headed Continental Airlines and Eastern
Airlines in the 1980s. Both companies eventually went bankrupt.

The South Korean state-controlled group said the record results were due to
growing demand for steel products from the motor vehicle and construction

Amcor, the Australian paper group, is to cut 530 jobs and invest an
immediate ADollars 51m (USDollars 36m) in mills in Tasmania and New South
Wales, in its efforts to create a viable Australian white paper industry.
Amcor acquired Associated Pulp and Paper Mills from its domestic rival,
North Broken Hill Peko, for ADollars 415m in September. The deal left Amcor
as the sole Australian manufacturer of white paper. Rationalisation was
expected, as Amcor attempted to combat strong import competition.
Amcor said that the job cuts would occur in Victoria, New South Wales and
Tasmania. Its five-year plan also envisages enterprise bargaining agreements
for individual mills.
The company also said that it was evaluating Dollars 65m-worth of investment
in projects to upgrade facilities and service.

<TEXT>
Honshu Paper, a leading Japanese paper and pulp company, and Takasaki Paper
have agreed an alliance involving the sharing of distribution and purchasing
channels.
The move follows mergers by other leading Japanese paper manufacturers last
year and is expected to generate further reorganisation of the country's
troubled paper and pulp industry, which has been facing thinner profit
margins due to over-supply and lower demand stemming from the economic
downturn.
Japan's material makers, including paper and pulp, cement and chemical
companies, are facing increased competition from south-east Asia due to the
strong yen. A shift of manufacturing centres by Japanese high-technology and
export-orientated manufacturers to overseas locations has also hurt demand.
The paper industry has been facing pressure from over capacity, and last
April Nippon Paper Industries was created by a merger between Jujo Paper and
Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, while in October, Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper merged to
become New Oji Paper.
Honshu said cost-cutting from streamlining operations was limited and it had
turned to a link-up with Takasaki for survival. The two companies will
provide products to each other for sale under their own brand names. Both
companies will invest some Y1bn (Dollars 8.9m) to buy each other's stock.
Honshu intends to take 3.26 per cent of Takasaki while Takasaki is planning
to hold a 0.46 per cent stake in Honshu.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: JCI climbs 12% as gold
production hits high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Record gold output and better gold prices gave combined after-tax income
from the gold mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment group a 12
per cent boost to R114.6m (Dollars 33.5m) in the December quarter. The mines
turned in R102.8m in the previous three months and R62.6m in the December
quarter of 1992.
Group gold production reached its highest level since 1978 at 13,373kg
against 13,229kg in the September quarter, with the average gold price
secured climbing to R39,066 a kg from R37,744 a kg.
Mr Kennedy Maxwell, chairman of JCI's gold division, said the mines' success
in keeping average working costs almost unchanged at R28,700 a kg during
1993 was a 'very satisfactory' achievement in a climate of near double-digit
inflation.
Western Areas achieved an increase in grade for the sixth quarter in a row
which at 7.34 grammes a tonne was the highest recorded since 1972 and likely
to be maintained in the current quarter. After-tax profit jumped 20 per cent
to R50.2m from R41.8m although capital spending rose as the mine upgraded
its electrical supply and pumping facilities.
Mr Maxwell said despite progress in talks about merging Western Areas with
the neighbouring South Deep mine, in the early stages of development from
Western Areas workings, a rights issue to finance full-scale development of
the multi-million rand project was a long way off.
A good quarter at Randfontein Estates, which turned in after-tax profit of
R65m against R57.2m, contrasted with a disappointing performance from the
Joel mine. Joel suffered a R637,000 after-tax loss, against after-tax income
of R3.81m, before capital spending of R8.03m.

<TEXT>
Hakuhodo, Japan's second largest advertising agency, yesterday dissolved a
34-year-old Tokyo-based joint venture with McCann-Erickson of the US. The
Japanese group said the joint venture, the country's ninth biggest agency,
had started to compete with its parent.
The company has handed over its 49 per cent stake in the venture to
McCann-Erickson. It said the subsidiary had originally done business with
overseas groups wanting to advertise in Japan.
But increasingly, the venture had taken on Japanese clients. The former
subsidiary, called McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo, would have to change its name
by March.
Japan's advertising industry has been hit by the worst recession since the
second world war. Mr Paul Smith, analyst at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo,
estimates that billings were down between 5 and 6 per cent last year in all
areas except spot television slots. 'There are slim pickings out there and
the recession may have exacerbated structural and cultural problems,' said
Mr Smith.

Mr Zhu, secretary-general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission,

investors and allowing Chinese citizens to hold 'foreigners-only' B shares.
Allowing overseas firms to list domestic A shares is also being considered,
but no decisions have been made, he said.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Guinness deal goes flat for LVMH
 -Shareholders will be seeking an explanation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When two companies announce a deal and one sees its shares dive down while
the other's shoot up, the first company has a problem.
This is the position in which LVMH, the French luxury goods group, found
itself after last Thursday's announcement that it had renegotiated its
seven-year-old cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks
concern. Mr Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman, is spending most of this
week trying to repair the damage.
'I thought the benefits of the agreement were obvious,' he says. 'But
perhaps we should have done more to explain them.'
The analysts who follow LVMH would certainly agree. The new agreement was
announced at a London conference, organised by Guinness, with only one LVMH
director present. The French group did not hold its own conference in Paris.
LVMH, having seen its shares fall by 5.5 per cent to FFr3,815 from FFr4,037
by last Friday, summoned the Paris analysts to a briefing this Thursday. The
shares promptly rallied on Monday and yesterday rose again to FFr3920 from
FFr3840. 'We should be able to explain everything on Thursday,' says Mr
Arnault. 'Better late than never.'
In theory Mr Arnault's explanation ought to be fairly easy. The new
agreement involves Guinness selling its indirect 24 per cent stake in LVMH
to Christian Dior and Au Bon Marche (two other companies controlled by Mr
Arnault) for Pounds 1.3bn (Dollars 1.9bn) and paying Pounds 902m to LVMH for
a 34 per cent holding in Moet Hennessy, the latter's champagne and cognac
business. LVMH has also agreed to reduce its Guinness holding (worth around
Pounds 400m) from 24 per cent to 20 per cent by the end of June.
Guinness should benefit by concentrating its LVMH investment in drinks, the
area of the business it knows best, and raising Pounds 416m in cash. But Mr
Arnault can also point to advantages for LVMH. Dior and Bon Marche will,
after all, pay for the deal. LVMH will emerge with a slightly smaller stake
in Guinness and enough cash to reduce its net debt from FFr15bn to FFr4bn.
Why then have LVMH's shareholders reacted so badly? One reason was the
group's misjudgment in failing to explain its side of the story. Another is
that the deal should slightly dilute LVMH's earnings in 1995 and 1996. But
the main factor is that Guinness's withdrawal leaves Mr Arnault in complete
control of LVMH at a time of growing concern about his strategy.
Mr Arnault, 44, made his name in the 1980s as an ambitious young businessman
who planned to revitalise the anachronistic French corporate scene with his
aggressive Anglo-Saxon tactics. 'Investors liked him because he was so
different from the old French industrialists,' says Ms Marie-Laure
Favre-Gilly, an analyst at Baring Securities in Paris. 'He really seemed to
be financially-driven: always looking at the bottom line.'
But analysts suspect that Mr Arnault has changed. They have long complained
about his fondness for chic soirees staged by his fashion houses. The final
straw was last year's acquisition of La Tribune Desfosses, the French
financial newspaper. 'Why invest in newspapers?' says Ms Favre-Gilly. 'It
makes him look like a megalomaniac.'
Analysts are worried that Mr Arnault may spend the proceeds of the new
Guinness agreement to finance other such deals for LVMH. Mr Arnault denies
this. 'My sole preoccupation is the bottom line,' he says. 'I'm the biggest
single shareholder in LVMH. All I care about is increasing our profits and
our share price.'
So why did he buy La Tribune? 'Because we also have a wider responsibility,'
he says. 'This was a French company that could have fallen into foreign
hands.' Is such a sentiment compatible with his professed obsession with
profitability? 'Of course,' he says. 'La Tribune was a tiny deal. We bought
it for a low price and we'll get a good return.'
But Mr Arnault insists he has no intention of making more investments in
newspapers.
'No one need worry on that score,' he says. 'I'm absolutely clear about our
strategy. LVMH is the world leader in the luxury goods industry and that's
where we'll expand.'
His aim, he says, is to launch new products for the group's established
brands and buy other luxury brand names that he can develop. He also plans
to fill the gaps in LVMH's portfolio by buying businesses in fields such as
jewellery. 'It's an attractive area for us,' says Mr Arnault. 'But we'll
only move if the right company comes up at the right price. We're not in a
hurry.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sales of Apple's MessagePad fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer has sold only about 75,000 of its highly-publicised Newton
MessagePad hand-held 'personal digital assistant' products since they were
introduced last August.
The group has been reluctant to reveal sales figures since it announced
initial sales of 50,000 units last September. The new figure demonstrates
that Newton sales have fallen off sharply over recent months.
Apple insists it is not disappointed and that new product sales volumes
typically decline after an initial rush of interest. However, analysts see
the latest figure as confirmation that Newton is failing to live up to the
company's expectations.
The Newton has been dogged by reports that its handwriting recognition
software is unreliable. Communications capabilities were also limited at the
time of its launch, although these can now be improved with add-on products.
Apple is expected to introduce new versions of Newton later this year.
Several companies that have licensed Newton technology are also expected to
launch products.
Poor sales could raise doubts about the commercial value of Newton
technology. However, initial sales are not always a good indicator of
long-term performance - Apple's first Macintosh personal computer, launched
10 years ago, was not an overwhelming success, but Apple has since sold
about 14m Macintosh PCs.
Slow Newton sales are, however, making potential competitors more cautious.
Compaq, which is developing a hand-held 'mobile-companion' that is expected
to compete with Newton, has decided to delay its introduction.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Merck and Warner-Lambert hit by
pressure from buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merck and Warner-Lambert, two of the US's biggest drugs groups, reported a
slow-down in pharmaceuticals sales in the final quarter of last year,
reflecting growing pressure from large buyers in the US and governments to
hold down costs, and the strong dollar.
Merck reported a 6 per cent rise in sales in the final quarter, to Dollars
2.7bn, before the effects of the takeover of the Medco drug distribution
business in November and the sale of the group's Calgon division.
Sales for the year, up 6 per cent at Dollars 10.2bn excluding Medco, were
held back by 'government cost control actions, primarily in Germany, strong
competition in the US and the slowing growth in the cholesterol-lowering
market, particularly in the US'.
For the quarter, net income rose to Dollars 674m, or 56 cents a share, from
Dollars 609m, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Without the earnings dilution due
to the Medco acquisition, earnings per share in the latest quarter would
have been 62 cents.
Post-tax profits for the full year, before accounting changes, were Dollars
2.2bn, or Dollars 1.87, down 11 per cent from the year, although before
restructuring charges and the effects of Medco they were 11 per cent ahead,
at Dollars 2.7bn.
Warner-Lambert saw a 7 per cent fall in pharmaceutical sales last year, to
Dollars 2.1bn, 3 per cent of which was accounted for by the strong dollar.
The results were also hit by a US regulators' ruling that forced the company
to close temporarily its Puerto Rico manufacturing operations.
Sales in Warner-Lambert's consumer products group, on the other hand, rose
11 per cent during the year.
Warner-Lambert reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of Dollars 197m,
or Dollars 1.46, after a previously announced Dollars 315m after-tax
restructuring charge, compared with a profit Dollars 138m profit, or Dollars
1.02, the year before.
For the year as a whole, net income before accounting changes was Dollars
285m, or Dollars 2.45, after total one-off charges for the year of Dollars
360m, against Dollars 644m, or Dollars 4.78, in 1992.
Burroughs Wellcome, the US division of Wellcome, the UK drugs company,
yesterday bought a group of biotechnolgical products with potential
applications in cancer treatments from Sterling Winthrop, owned by Eastman
Kodak, Daniel Green adds.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: US oil groups overcome sharp
drop in world prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three biggest US oil groups - Exxon, Mobil and Chevron - all reported
sharply higher refining and marketing earnings for the last three months of
1993, helping to offset the effects of the precipitous fall in world oil
prices.
Together with significant cost-cutting over the past year, the rise in
profits from downstream activities enabled both Exxon and Mobil to report
higher operating income for the period compared with a year before, while
Chevron profits eased slightly.
At Exxon, upstream exploration and production earnings fell to Dollars 743m,
from Dollars 1bn the year before (before one-off items). This was balanced
by higher downstream profits, which rose to Dollars 625m from Dollars 399m
(before special items). Recurring profits from chemicals rose to Dollars
143m from Dollars 71m on lower costs and a shift towards higher-margin
products.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share,
from Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 1.12, the year before. Full-year earnings at
Exxon were also bolstered by Dollars 450m of cost savings, taking net income
to Dollars 5.3bn on sales of Dollars 111bn compared with Dollars 4.8bn for
1992 on sales of Dollars 117bn.
Mobil said its exploration and production earnings fell by Dollars 137m
during the last quarter, to Dollars 337m, while marketing and refining
profits rose by Dollars 150m to Dollars 355m (excluding all special items).
Unlike others, Mobil failed to see an upturn in its chemicals business,
which is heavily dependent on polyethylene prices, and reported operating
income of Dollars 1m down from Dollars 4m.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 349m (Dollars 602m before charges),
compared with Dollars 582m a year earlier. For the year as a whole, net
income was Dollars 2.1bn (Dollars 2.3bn before special items and accounting
changes) compared with Dollars 862m (Dollars 1.5bn) for 1992.
At Chevron, net income for the final quarter totalled Dollars 294m (Dollars
515m before special items), compared with Dollars 1.1bn (Dollars 542m before
items) the year before. Exploration and production earnings fell from
Dollars 342m to Dollars 283m, while refining and marketing income climbed
from Dollars 192m to Dollars 236m.
Full-year net income reached Dollars 1.3bn (Dollars 2.1bn before one-off
factors), compared with Dollars 1.6bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in 1992.
Mr Ken Derr, the chairman and chief executive, pointed to cost cutting as an
important factor behind the improvement. Operating and administrative costs
per barrel fell by 40 cents during the year to Dollars 6.51, he added.

Nynex, the Baby Bell telecommunications company serving the north-eastern
US, is to cut its workforce by 16,800, or 22 per cent, by the end of 1996
and has taken a Dollars 1.6bn charge against fourth-quarter earnings to
cover the restructuring.
The cuts are the latest in a series by local US telephone companies, which
face a breakdown of their traditional monopolies as the telecommunications
and entertainment industries converge in a new multi-media sector.
As a result of the charges, Nynex reported a net loss for the fourth quarter
of Dollars 1.24bn, or Dollars 3 a share, against net income of Dollars
324.2m, or 79 cents, in the same period of 1992.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Northern Telecom back in the
black
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of last
year, but the telecommunications equipment maker dampened the good news with
a warning that it would slip back into the red in the early part of 1994.
Following two consecutive quarterly losses, Northern posted fourth-quarter
net earnings of USDollars 106m, or 42 cents a share, down from Dollars 256m,
or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped by 3.3 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn, with strong growth in
Europe more than offset by declines in Canada and other overseas markets.
Revenues from central office switches were flat, but sales of cable and
transmission products were sharply down.
Fourth-quarter orders were little changed but the year-end order backlog of
Dollars 4.82bn was 35 per cent higher.
Northern has been thrown into turmoil by a loss of market share in its core
central office switch business, delays in bringing fibre-optic transmission
products to market, and its slow start in cellular phone technology.
Mr Jean Monty, who has spearheaded a shake-up since taking over as chief
executive last year, said the restructuring begun in mid-1993 will take 18
months. As a result, 'we will build profitability as we go through the
year'.
An operating loss is expected in the first quarter, due to a combination of
pricing pressures, unfavourable product mix and seasonally lower volumes.
But Mr Monty expressed the hope that the benefits of lower costs and a
strengthened portfolio of products would emerge later in the year.
He singled out wireless and broadband radio products to be launched in the
second quarter, and rising sales of central office software in the second

<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company, yesterday reported a 34 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, powered by strong US video sales of
its hit cartoon film Aladdin.
However, the results excluded its 49 per cent investment in Euro Disney, the
loss-making theme park near Paris which is about to start negotiations with
its banks over an emergency refinancing.
Walt Disney said it had not included Euro Disney because it took a Dollars
350m charge last November to reserve fully against receivables due to it
from the park, and its provision of limited and temporary funding until the
end of March.
The treatment underscores Wall Street expectations that Walt Disney will
take a tough line in negotiations with Euro Disney's creditors and will
insist it will not provide funding beyond March 31. If a refinancing were
not agreed by then, the park could close.
Walt Disney reported net income of Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 275m, or 50 cents, before accounting changes in the
first quarter of last year. Revenues rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn.
Operating income was up 26 per cent at Dollars 624.4m.
The best performance came from the filmed entertainment business, which saw
operating income rise 45 per cent to Dollars 340m on revenues 18 per cent
ahead at Dollars 1.4bn.
This was due mainly to the success of the film Aladdin in video form in the
US market, and in cinemas in international markets. Another factor was the
international video release of Jungle Book.
Theme parks saw operating income rise only 1 per cent to Dollars 138m, on
revenues 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 769m.

Colombia's biggest privatisation was completed this week with the sale of 75
per cent of the Banco de Colombia to Bancol, the Cali-based business group.
Including smaller packages of shares bought by employees and other
investors, the bank was sold for around Dollars 500m.
Banco de Colombia, originally part of the Grupo Grancolombiano which
collapsed in the mid-1980s, was nationalised and rehabilitated by the
government. It is one of the biggest banks in Colombia, with about 12 per
cent of the total assets of the country's financial system, 11 per cent of
local branches and majority holdings in several subsidiaries.
Bancol, owned by the Gilinski family, offered about Dollars 360m for 75 per
cent of the shares.
The government has been trying to prevent drug money from filtering into the
financial system through privatisation deals.
The Gilinski family owns several small industries as well as the Banco
Andino, which has about 1.5 per cent of the local market.
Banco de Colombia has a subsidiary in Panama and owns the Eagle National
Bank of Miami.
An offering of Dollars 220m notes exchangeable into shares is also being
made internationally through Deutsche Bank and its Morgan Grenfell
subsidiary in London.
Renault, the French state-owned vehicle company, is selling control of its
Colombian subsidiary to the Santo Domingo Group, one of the country's
largest business concerns, John Ridding adds from Paris. The move is the
final step in Renault's policy of reducing its exposure to financial and
political risks in Latin America, while maintaining its commercial presence.

accounting changes and 90 cents after the changes.
Last year Martin Marietta bought General Electric's aerospace division for
Dollars 3.05bn and General Dynamics' space launch business for Dollars
208.5m.
Full-year net income rose to Dollars 450.3m from Dollars 345.4m before
accounting changes, but slumped to Dollars 20.9m after the changes. Turnover
was up to Dollars 9.44bn from Dollars 5.95bn.
Earnings per share rose to Dollars 4.25 from Dollars 3.60 before accounting
changes, but turned into losses of 26 cents a share after the changes.

USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority stake,
yesterday showed progress in cutting its losses, reporting a fall in its
fourth-quarter after-tax deficit to Dollars 116.5m from Dollars 254m last
time.
The final quarter's performance helped bring a significant cut in full-year
losses to Dollars 349.4m from Dollars 600.8m before accounting changes and
to Dollars 393.1m from Dollars 1.23bn after the changes. But it also marked
the end of the fifth consecutive year in which USAir has failed to show a
net profit.
Like other US airlines, it has been suffering intense competition from
low-cost carriers and has been trying to cut costs in response. In the year
just ended it benefited from a slight recovery in the US market and from a
steep decline in fuel prices.
The company said if all non-recurring items were stripped out of its
full-year results, it would have shown an operating profit of Dollars 23.7m,
compared with operating losses of Dollars 223.1m the year before.
But Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive, acknowledged the
airline's financial results remained unsatisfactory in spite of the progress
made.
Fourth-quarter turnover rose to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 1.63bn and losses
per share fell to Dollars 2.29 from Dollars 5.66, while full-year turnover
rose to Dollars 7.08bn from Dollars 6.69bn. Losses per share fell to Dollars
7.68 from Dollars 13.88 before accounting changes and to Dollars 8.48 from
Dollars 27.23 after the changes.

Dean Witter, Discover, the US financial services group, reported a 47 per
cent jump in net income for last year to Dollars 604m, or Dollars 3.66 a
share, as its securities and credit card businesses reported strong
advances.
Buoyed by the same surge in US underwriting and record commission income
that have pushed earnings at other securities houses to new highs, the
company's securities business reported net income in the last quarter of
Dollars 75m, and Dollars 284m for the year as a whole.
During the latest period, commission income at Dollars 237m was 28 per cent
higher than a year before, while revenues from principal trading fell 13 per
cent to Dollars 90m.
After-tax profits from the Discover card, which has more account holders in
the US than any other payment card, rose to Dollars 63.6m in the quarter,
from Dollars 35.6m the year before, as revenue growth of 22 per cent
outpaced a slower rise in costs.
The card, launched in 1985, first came into profit in 1988 and has continued
to grow strongly since.
Revenues in the latest quarter were helped by a 31 per cent increase in fees
from merchants and cardholders, mainly due to higher transaction volumes on
existing cards.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merck and Warner Lambert, two of the US's biggest drugs groups, reported a
slow-down in sales of pharmaceuticals in the final quarter of last year,
reflecting the growing pressure from large buyers in the US and governments
to hold down drug costs.
Merck reported a 6 per cent rise in sales in the final quarter, to Dollars
2.7bn, before the effects of the takeover of the Medco drug distribution
business in November and the sale of the group's Calgon division.
The strength of the US dollar also held back the growth in sales, which
would otherwise have been 8 per cent in the period, said Mr Roy Vagelos,
chairman and chief executive.
Merck said that sales for the year, up 6 per cent at Dollars 10.2bn
excluding Medco, were held back by 'government cost control actions,
primarily in Germany, strong competition in the US and the slowing growth in
the cholesterol-lowering market, particularly in the US'.
However, it added that it had seen 'strong unit sales gains' in several new
products.
For the quarter, net income rose to Dollars 674m, or 56 cents a share, from
Dollars 609m, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Without the earnings dilution due
to the Medco acquisition, earnings per share in the latest quarter would
have been 62 cents.
Post-tax profits for the full year, before accounting changes, were Dollars
2.2bn, or Dollars 1.87, down 11 per cent from the year, although before
restructuring charges and the effects of Medco they were 11 per cent ahead,
at Dollars 2.7bn.
Warner Lambert saw a 7 per cent fall in pharmaceutical sales last year, to
Dollars 2.1bn, 3 per cent of which was accounted for by the strength of the
dollar.
The results were also hit by a ruling from US regulators that forced the
company to close temporarily its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico,
leading to lost sales of Dollars 135m.
Sales in Warner Lambert's consumer products group, on the other hand, rose
11 per cent during the year, with an 18 per cent growth rate outside the US,
22 per cent after adjusting for exchange rates.
Warner Lambert reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of Dollars 197m,
or Dollars 1.46, after a previously announced Dollars 315m after-tax
restructuring charge, compared with a profit Dollars 138m profit, or Dollars
1.02, the year before.
For the year as a whole, net income before accounting changes was Dollars
285m, or Dollars 2.45, after total one-off charges for the year of Dollars
360m, against Dollars 644m, or Dollars 4.78, in 1992.

Walt Disney, the US entertainment company, yesterday reported a 34 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, powered by strong US video sales of
its hit cartoon film Aladdin.
However, the results excluded its 49 per cent investment in Euro Disney, the
loss-making theme park near Paris which is about to start full-scale
negotiations with its banks over an emergency re-financing package.
Walt Disney said it had not included Euro Disney because it took a Dollars
350m charge last November to reserve fully against receivables due to it
from the park and its provision of limited and temporary funding to the
business until the end of March.
The treatment underscores Wall Street expectations that Walt Disney will
take a tough line in negotiations with Euro Disney's creditors and will
insist it will not provide funding beyond March 31. If a refinancing were
not agreed by then, the park could close.
Walt Disney reported net income of Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 275m, or 50 cents, before accounting changes in the
first quarter of last year.
Revenues rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. Operating income was up 26 per
cent at Dollars 624.4m.
The best performance came from the filmed entertainment business, which saw
operating income rise 45 per cent to Dollars 340m on revenues 18 per cent
ahead at Dollars 1.4bn.
This was due mainly to the success of the film Aladdin in video cassette
form in the US market, and in cinemas in international markets.
Another factor was the international home video release of Jungle Book.
Disney's theme parks saw operating income rise only 1 per cent to Dollars
138m, on revenues 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 769m.
The company said an increase in occupied room nights at its Florida resorts
and a growth in per capita spending had contributed to the higher results,
but these had been partly offset by slightly lower theme park attendance,
due to the softness in international tourism.
The consumer products segment saw operating income rise 17 per cent to
Dollars 146m on revenues 22 per cent ahead ahead at Dollars 532m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of last
year, but the telecommunications equipment maker dampened the good news with
a warning that it would slip back into the red in the early part of 1994.
Following two consecutive quarterly losses, Northern posted fourth-quarter
net earnings of USDollars 106m, or 42 cents a share, down from Dollars 256m,
or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped by 3.3 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn, with strong growth in
Europe more than offset by declines in Canada and other overseas markets.
Revenues from central office switches were flat, but sales of cable and
transmission products were sharply down.
Fourth-quarter orders were virtually unchanged from a year earlier, but the
year-end order backlog of Dollars 4.82bn was 35 per cent higher.
Northern has been thrown into turmoil by a loss of market share in its core
central office switch business, delays in bringing fibre-optic transmission
products to market, and its slow start in cellular phone technology.
Mr Jean Monty, who has spearheaded a shake-up since taking over as chief
executive early last year, said the restructuring plan begun in mid-1993
will take 18 months to complete. As a result, 'we will build profitability
as we go through the year'.
An operating loss is expected in the first quarter, due to a combination of
pricing pressures, unfavourable product mix and seasonally lower volumes.
But Mr Monty expressed the hope that the benefits of lower costs and a
strengthened portfolio of products would emerge later in the year.
He singled out wireless and broadband radio products to be launched in the
second quarter, and rising sales of central office software in the second
half.
Ms Hilary Mine, an analyst with Northern Business Information in Portland,
Oregon, predicted that 'in the long run, you'll see them come back as a
major player'.
Ms Mine said she was impressed by new switching software unveiled last
autumn, and by its growing focus on operations outside North America.
The contribution of offshore markets grew to 29 per cent of revenues last
year from 26 per cent in 1992. Northern suffered losses of Dollars 878m, or
Dollars 3.54 per share, for 1993 as a whole, due largely to restructuring
and other charges totalling Dollars 1.16bn.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault, the French state-owned vehicle company, is selling control of its
Colombian subsidiary to the Santo Domingo Group, one of the country's
largest business concerns.
The move is the latest and final step in Renault's policy of reducing its
exposure to financial and political risks in Latin America, while
maintaining its commercial presence. In April last year, it sold its
Venezuelan subsidiary to local industrialists and in 1992 it sold control of
its Argentine operations to a local holding company.
Under the terms of the deal, Renault is selling 51 per cent of the shares in
Sofasa, its Colombian subsidiary, to Bavaria, part of the the Santo Domingo
Group. Renault's stake in Sofasa is reduced to 24 per cent, with the balance
held by Toyota and Mitsui of Japan.
Sofasa, which assembles the Renault 9 and the Renault 21 at its Medelin
plant, will continue to produce Renault vehicles. It will also expand
Renault's commercial base and its distribution network in Colombia. The
production of Toyota's utility vehicles - the Landcruiser and Hilux - will
be unaffected.
Last year, Sofasa produced more than 12,000 Renault cars and accounted for
about 13 per cent of the Colombian market. In 1992, Sofasa reported net
profits of FFr18m, and remained in profit last year.
Renault's sales in Latin America increased from about 83,000 in 1992 to
108,500 last year.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lehman's world turns full circle
 -Richard Waters considers the prospects for the firm after its spin-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Lehman Brothers, the world will turn full circle in April. It will be
exactly 10 years since the then-private investment banking firm, torn by
rivalries between its partners, was sold to American Express. It is also
likely to be the month the credit card group spins off Lehman Brothers
again, replete with Dollars 1.25bn of new capital to enable it to become an
independent company.
The demise of the old Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in 1984 was one of Wall
Street's greatest dramas. Its sale, after 134 years as a private firm, was
triggered by a power-struggle at the top of the firm, setting off a
chain-reaction of rivalries between Lehman's 44 partners.
For American Express, it represented a way, along with the acquisition of
the Shearson retail broking firm, to expand into businesses which were
projected - rightly - to become among the financial industry's biggest
profit-earners.
Yet the credit card group was never able to generate the same profits as
others in the industry, and has been bent on selling businesses in the past
two years to shore up its core credit card and other consumer finance
businesses.
Lehman's new freedom emerged late on Monday, as American Express announced
it would spin off the company to the group's shareholders in the form of a
tax-free dividend, expected to be completed in April.
To gain a single-A rating from credit rating agencies, essential for any
financial company which has a large inventory of stocks and other securities
to finance, Lehman's capital base is being boosted with Dollars 1.25bn of
new capital, Dollars 1.09bn provided by American Express and Dollars 160m by
Lehman's employees.
The Lehman set to emerge from under American Express's wing is in many ways
similar to the Lehman of 10 years ago, although it is considerably larger.
It has always been seen primarily as an investment banking firm, known for
its underwriting and corporate advisory work, rather than as a trading
house.
Yet Lehman had been building a trading business in the fixed income and
money markets before the sale to American Express - headed at the time by Mr
Richard Fuld, the firm's current president and chief executive.
The firm continues to be known mainly for its investment banking work,
although trading has become the bigger revenue-earner. Last year, while
investment banking income rose a steady 19 per cent, to Dollars 802m,
trading income soared by 47 per cent, to Dollars 1.6bn.
The challenge facing Lehman is to lift profitability to secure its position
as one of the so-called 'bulge bracket' of banks that dominate investment
banking both in the US and internationally.
Judged by its projected equity capital base, Lehman looks to be firmly in
the leading group. The Dollars 1.25bn injection will catapult it towards the
top of the league, giving it total capital of Dollars 3.3bn.
At that level, it may not stand exactly shoulder-to-shoulder with giants
like Merrill Lynch (which had Dollars 4.6bn of equity a year ago, a figure
which is likely to have risen considerably since) and Salomon (Dollars
4.3bn). Yet it still ranks as one of the biggest institutions, and has come
a long way since 1991, when its equity base was a mere Dollars 1bn.
The extra capital is a mixed blessing. Even with its smaller equity base,
Lehman's earnings last year - Dollars 376m after tax, leaving aside one-off
items - gave it a lower return on capital than most of its rivals. With the
swollen equity base, return on capital will look weaker still - just 14 per
cent post-tax, based on last year's earnings, a scant return for a
securities firm during what is widely seen as the peak of the market.
American Express chairman Mr Harvey Golub certainly believes that the
requirements of the rating agencies have left Lehman overcapitalised. As a
result, the credit card group has kept an interest in the firm's future
profits, which could allow it to take back Dollars 400m over the next eight
years if Lehman's earnings rise above a certain level.
Lehman has been striving for the past two years to lift revenue sources and
improve profit margins. Known mainly for its fixed income expertise, Lehman
has embarked on expansion primarily in foreign exchange, along with swaps
and other derivatives markets. It has also invested in expanding its
international operations in an attempt to catch up with the international
dominance built up by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Competitors single out Lehman's lack of a US retail client base as a
weakness (the Shearson broking business was sold to rival Smith Barney last
year). However, the firm claims it has an adequate base of investors in the
US, and has not targeted this as an area for investment.

<TEXT>
Baer Holding, the Zurich-based banking group, has reported consolidated net
income for 1993 of SFr147m (Dollars 100m), more than double the SFr68m
earned in 1992.
Baer, which specialises in managing funds for institutions and wealthy
individuals, said all areas of its business contributed to the 47 per cent
rise in operating income to SFr628m, but income from trading was especially
buoyant.
Provisions for depreciation and bad loans were raised 54 per cent to SFr77m,
leaving pre-tax profit of SFr206m, more than three times the SFr87m earned
in 1992.
Baer said its consolidated total assets stood at SFr7.7bn at the year-end,
23 per cent higher than at the end of 1992. Shareholders' equity jumped 36
per cent to SFr919m.
Client assets entrusted to the Baer group, excluding those for which only
global custody service was provided, were up 36 per cent to SFr45bn. Net
assets of Baer investment funds soared 74 per cent to SFr5.4bn.
The directors are recommending a 20 per cent rise in dividends on the bearer
and registered shares plus a subscription right or option worth about twice
the value of the dividends.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swedish steel group in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish steel group, swung to a SKr776m (Dollars 96m) profit in
1993 from a SKr165m loss a year earlier, as the effects of cost-cutting and
a weak krona helped to compensate for depressed market conditions.
Stronger than expected final-quarter profits of SKr421m allowed SSAB
comfortably to beat its November forecast of SKr600m for the full year. A 40
per cent rise in the dividend to SKr7 a share is proposed.
Mr Leif Gustafsson, SSAB president, said: 'We have shown we can earn money
in a very weak market. Of course, the weaker Swedish krona helped but even
more important was the streamlining of our steel business at the end of the
1980s and our efforts to cut costs.'
The weaker Swedish currency meant krona prices for the group's products were
8 per cent higher than in 1992, helping to lift turnover by 9 per cent to
SKr12.9bn. The group said that it benefited from a slight increase in demand
in Sweden, even though steel consumption in western Europe was down by 8 per
cent.
A continuing costs-squeeze meant operating expenses rose by only 1.5 per
cent to SKr11.6bn. Processing costs were 4 per cent lower and employees were
cut by 5 per cent to 9,500.
SSAB is hoping for higher profits in 1994. It expects steel demand to remain
weak in western Europe, at least during the first half, but anticipates
higher profits from its Swedish activities due to increased demand.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Shift in manufacturing to
Tungsram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric of the US is moving the manufacture of lighting products to
its Tungsram subsidiary in Hungary from plants in western Europe.
Mr Jack Welch, the group's chairman said yesterday: 'In the European
manufacturing sense, Hungary will be our principal base. There is no
question.'
GE is closing down its plant producing incandescent light bulbs in Preston
in the UK with the loss of 330 jobs and is in the process of transferring
some of the machinery to Hungary.
The rationalisation is part of GE's merger of its own European lighting
business with Tungsram and the lighting interests bought from Thorn-EMI in
1991.
The group is also winding down facilities in Wimbledon in the UK, and in
Austria and Germany, and assigning output to its factories in Hungary.
While there have been several examples of German and Austrian manufacturers
relocating production to eastern Europe to escape high costs, GE's shift is
the clearest example involving the UK. GE is, however, maintaining its UK
facilities at Enfield and Leicester.
The group's main competitors in the European lighting market have also
sought out lower overheads in eastern Europe, with Philips, the Dutch
electrical group, investing in Poland and Germany's Osram in the Czech
Republic.
GE said it had centred in Nagykanizsa production of compact fluorescent
bulbs, the energy-efficient lighting source which is the fastest growing
part of the market. GE announced plans to invest Dollars 30m to Dollars 50m
a year in Tungsram.
Underlying GE's commitment to manufacturing in Hungary, which remains strong
despite initial heavy losses, are sharp improvements in efficiency. GE said
total productivity at Tungsram rose by 16 per cent in 1993.
'We are now well positioned with a productive, excited and empowered
workforce that is going to be a major factor in the whole of Europe,' said
Mr Welch.
Continuing productivity improvements, combined with an easing of the
Budapest government's exchange rate policy, have allowed GE to hold relative
labour costs steady for the first time since it entered eastern Europe.
The improvements in productivity are the key to GE Lighting Europe's efforts
to match Osram's pre-tax operating margin this year and draw level with
Philips in 1995.
GE says it sees Hungary as more than a low-cost manufacturing site. The
group has made Hungary a centre for lighting research, with nearly as many
engineers employed in Budapest as in GE headquarters in Cleveland. 'Pound
for pound they are every bit as good,' said Mr Welch.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: MCI in Mexican joint venture
with Banacci
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the innovative US long-distance telecommunications
group, and Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest
financial group, joined forces yesterday to compete in the Mexican
long-distance market, which is being thrown open to new entrants from August
1996.
They announced the establishment of a joint venture, owned 55 per cent by
Banacci and 45 per cent by MCI, to compete against the national carrier,
Telmex.
Initially capitalised at Dollars 1bn, the venture will apply for a Mexican
long distance licence and build a state of the art fibre-optic
telecommunications network.
Banamex, a subsidiary of Banacci and Mexico's largest commercial bank,
already provides private telecommunications services to Mexican businesses,
using its own communications network.
MCI, in which British Telecom is buying a 20 per cent stake, has played the
leading role in opening up the US long-distance market to competition over
the past 20 years. Earlier this month it announced plans to compete in the
monopolistic local US market and extend its long-distance reach under a new
brand name, networkMCI.
MCI said the Banacci deal was a key international element in the networkMCI
scheme and would allow the company to complete the first integrated North
American network, providing services with identical features to customers
throughout the region.
In 1992 MCI formed an alliance with Stentor, the long-distance arm of
Canadian regional phone companies, which uses MCI's intelligent network for
services between the US and Canada.
The Mexican long-distance telecommunications market is growing quickly,
thanks to rapid economic development and the boost to commerce from last
year's North American Free Trade Agreement.
MCI estimates that the country's international long-distance market is
growing at more than 20 per cent a year, that 40 per cent of all its
long-distance traffic is international, and that 90 per of Mexican
international calls go to the US or Canada.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Property losses hit results at
Bouygues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bouygues, France's largest construction group, yesterday announced a sharp
fall in estimated net profits for last year, to FFr450m (Dollars 76m) from
FFr685m, as a result of losses in its property division.
The company said the expected 34 per cent decline in profits, which was
larger than most analysts had forecast, was caused by property losses of
FFr150m. Its other activities, in construction, media and engineering, had
resisted the effects of recession, increasing net profits slightly to
FFr600m. The dividend was maintained at FFr16 per share.
The decline in property activities, which were profitable in 1992, was
blamed on what the company described as the worst downturn the market had
experienced. Bouygues' strong presence in the Parisian property market, one
of the areas most seriously affected by the downturn, compounded the impact.
The weak state of the property market was also reflected in the level of
sales in the division, which totalled FFr4.3bn last year, a fall of more
than one-fifth from 1992.
Bouygues said it saw little immediate prospect of a recovery in the property
market and forecast another steep decline in sales this year, to FFr3.3bn.
Group sales fell to FFr59.7bn from FFr62.7bn. For 1994, Bouygues forecast
turnover of just under FFr59bn, reflecting the decline in property sales.
Bouygues is seeking to expand its activities in telecommunications. In
particular, the group intends to bid for a third mobile telephone licence to
be awarded by the French government later this year.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: GE Hungarian venture in profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric of the US, yesterday declared
that Tungsram, its Hungarian lighting venture, was moving into profit after
three years of losses.
He said that GE Lighting Europe, combining Tungsram and the lighting
business bought from Thorn-EMI of the UK in 1991, had improved to a pre-tax
profit last year of up to Dollars 25m. This represents a strong improvement
on the 1990 - 92 period, when Tungsram made a total loss of Ft16.4bn
(Dollars 160m), which effectively wiped out the company's capital.
'We found the light switch. We are a couple of years - not five years - away
from having a very profitable, big-winning operation,' he said.
This forecast offers hope at a time when other multinational investors, such
as Volkswagen and Air France, are running into problems with their
acquisitions in the region.
Investors have taken GE's experience with Tungsram as a bellwether. GE has a
reputation for industrial turnrounds, and its purchase of Tungsram in 1990
was the first significant commitment by a western company in eastern Europe,
and remains one of the largest to date.
Mr Welch, while bullish about Tungsram's future, admitted that GE had
underestimated the effort required to restructure Tungsram. 'We couldn't be
happier; we probably could not have been more nave four years ago,' he said.
GE paid Dollars 150m for 50 per cent of Tungsram in 1990 but buying out
minority shareholders and injecting fresh capital has taken the investment
to Dollars 550m and GE's stake to 99.6 per cent. 'We spent more than we
thought we were going to spend but we are happy as hell that we did it,'
said Mr Welch.
GE needed Tungsram's market share in western Europe to give it the critical
mass to compete against Philips of the Netherlands and Osram of Germany.
'Strategically, our major competitors are located in Europe and they have
positions in the US. We had to be in Europe,' said Mr Welch.
Tungsram's financial performance has benefited from the retirement of the
company's most expensive debt with the Ft16bn capital injection into
Tungsram effected in August 1993.

trading
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bank Slaski soared on the first day of trading in the group to
6.7m zlotys (Dollars 310), compared with the issue price of 500,000 zlotys
when 30 per cent of the Polish bank's equity was sold to the public last
November.
Earlier this month ING, the Dutch bank, purchased a 25.9 per cent stake in
Bank Slaski at the offer price, which represented a Dollars 57.1m
investment. The bank promised to hold the shares for three years.
The closing price left bankers and small investors surprised. 'I simply
don't know where the money is coming from,' a financier commented.
There are now 23 stocks traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange with a combined
capitalisation of 149,183.5bn zlotys. Bank Slaski's debut came as the
exchange index climbed to another record, up 6.1 per cent to 16,808.6, with
turnover at 2,925bn zlotys.
Mr Stefan Kawalec, the deputy finance minister who is responsible for
Poland's bank privatisation programme, noted, however, that yesterday's
Slaski turnover accounted for a mere 0.35 per cent of the bank's equity. He
said the results of the Slaski sale would be examined very carefully when
choosing a strategy for the sale of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo
Handlowy, which he hopes to complete by the middle of this year.
Yesterday's share price gives Bank Slaski, which reported a 1,865bn zloty
net profit for last year, a price earnings ratio of 33.5, compared with an
average of 32.8 for the other three banks quoted on the exchange.
Morgan Grenfell has opened an office in Warsaw. The UK-based merchant bank
is advising the Polish government on the sale of the tobacco industry and
acted for AT&amp;T when it bought the Telfa telecommunications plant recently.
Morgan Grenfell's move to Warsaw follows Schroder and Samuel Montagu, which
both have local subsidiaries.

The combination of lower Brent oil prices and a decline in French production
were blamed by Triton Europe for a swing from profits of Pounds 18,000 to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.76m for the half year to November 30.
Turnover fell to Pounds 6.94m (Pounds 9.37m). Interest income rose to Pounds
166,000 (Pounds 138,000) but foreign exchange gains fell to Pounds 108,000
(Pounds 868,000). Losses worked through at 2.45p (earnings 0.07p). Cash and
short term investments amounted to Pounds 7.14m, equal to 8.7p per share.
Earlier this month Triton Energy, the independent US oil and gas company,
made an agreed offer to acquire the minority interests in the company - it
currently holds a 59.47 per cent stake.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Willoughby's falls after mining setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A decrease arising mainly from its mining operations, where production was
at a reduced level, meant pre-tax profits of Willoughby's Consolidated
declined from a restated Pounds 1.79m to Pounds 1.64m in the year to
September 30.
The result included a Pounds 34,000 profit (Pounds 714,000 loss) share from
the Northchart Investments associate, attributable to a reduced loss on sale
of investments. As a result of an accounting change, profit on disposal of
investments is now calculated according to book value of investments rather
than original cost.
Turnover climbed to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.1m). Earnings per share slipped
from 16.2p to 14.8p and a final dividend of 1p makes a total for the year of
1.5p (2.5p).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Menvier-Swain Group fell by 30p to 250p after the emergency
lighting and fire alarms company warned that its second-half results might
be influenced by recession in some continental European markets.
Pre-tax profits advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 4.1m in the six months to
October 31, while sales increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 33.8m.
Mr Roy McDowell, chairman, said the UK businesses were expected to perform
well in the second half. Overall, he was confident that the full-year result
would be an improvement over last year.
Having weathered recession in the UK, Mr McDowell said he was now pleased to
report increases in both sales and profits for the UK emergency lighting and
fire alarm companies.
'In the security market, Westminster performed strongly, but Menvier
Security had a disappointing first half with sales taking longer to increase
than originally expected. Transmould, our Irish subsidiary, performed
strongly and is now a significant contributor to group profits.'
He said the group was now seeing for the first time recessionary effects in
some markets in continental Europe, 'although not to the extent that we saw
two years ago in the UK.'
Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said a Pounds 200,000 loss in Germany
reflected delays in introducing new, UK-manufactured products and
post-acquisition rationalisation costs. There were no signs of recession in
France, but cost-cutting by a leading competitor in emergency lighting had
reduced margins.
Earnings rose to 5.6p (4.9p). In raising the dividend to 1.3p from a
restated 1.1p, directors said they had taken into account current trading
conditions and a desire to increase the proportion of the total paid at the
interim stage.
COMMENT
The share price fell sharply partly because the figures were a little below
expectations and partly because they had enjoyed a sharp run-up ahead of the
announcement. Analysts revised their full-year forecasts from just over
Pounds 10m to about Pounds 9.5m, but seem satisfied that these numbers were
caused by a combination of specific problems, rather than a deeper failure
of the group's expansionary strategy in Europe. The shares are on a
prospective multiple of 19.5, a 13 per cent premium to the market. That is
justified by the group's track record in growing profits through recession,
but buyers at this level will be looking for long-term growth rather than
immediate outperformance.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Where there's a wheel there's a way - The
latest move to resuscitate the Norton motorcycle business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The production line at Norton, one of Britain's most famous motorcycle
manufacturers, is silent. Beside it, a wrecked Norton Commander awaits
repair - the victim of a Volvo which smashed through the fairing and severed
the front wheel.
Held upright by an overhead chain, the motorcycle resembles a half-eaten
carcass with its mechanical organs exposed.
Like the motorcycle, Norton itself has been crashed, almost written off and
left in need of urgent repair.
Ms Rozanda Skalbania, a director of Norton Motors (1993) - the new
Canada-based owner - admits it will be an uphill struggle to revive the
company.
The workforce at the Shenstone plant near Lichfield has been cut from 270 in
the early 1990s to just 22. Motorcycle production has ceased and the company
is relying on service and repair contracts to pay the wages.
'We're going to have to expand,' says Ms Skalbania. 'It's taken a lot of
goodwill by the workforce to keep it going this far.'
The first stage in that expansion was announced this week when Wildrose, the
Canadian investment vehicle which last October paid about CDollars 1m
(Pounds 500,000) for Norton's name and assets, unveiled plans for a reverse
takeover in the US.
The takeover, giving Norton a listing on the US bulletin board in pink
securities, is designed to help the company raise finance to restart
production at Shenstone, launch a race team in North America and develop its
rotary engine technology for new uses.
The vision, however, is somewhat removed from reality. Although the Norton
race team has enjoyed recent success, notably in the Isle of Man TT,
Wildrose faces considerable obstacles in attracting investors.
Those obstacles date back to the mid-1980s, when Mr Philippe Le Roux began a
reign as chief executive which saw Norton embark on a disastrous expansion
strategy.
Mr Le Roux tried to sustain lossmaking motorcycle production by acquiring
allegedly profitable companies. In 1988 Norton acquired Pro-Fit, a US piping
business, for Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m), but it failed to produce the income
expected. Then in 1990 it launched a bungled rights issue to acquire FUS,
the German fasteners business, for Pounds 8.2m.
The City turned its back on Norton when it emerged that the Pro-Fit
acquisition was completed only when the company resorted to high cost loans.
More controversially, inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry
were called in when it was discovered that a company controlled by Mr Jimmy
Tildesley, then Norton chairman, profited from the FUS transaction.
Only 11.2 per cent of the shareholders took up the rights offer, leaving Mr
Le Roux and his private company, Manstorm, with a Pounds 1.75m underwriting
commitment which it could not meet.
Mr Le Roux, who resigned after the DTI announced its inquiry, told the
inspectors: 'I approached a Canadian firm called Ponderosa Investments run
by Mr Nelson Skalbania, both on the amount we required and when I had
difficulty covering my own obligation on that amount as well.'
Mr Skalbania, Rozanda's father, did not oblige but his interest was aroused
in Norton.
Following Mr Le Roux's departure, he began to court the company in earnest.
First he brokered Norton's 1992 disposal of FUS to Westgroup Corporation of
Canada. The company, which cost Pounds 8.2m, was sold for Pounds 50,000 cash
with DM17m (Pounds 6.6m) in liabilities.
Then in January 1993 - shortly before the Serious Fraud Office began an
ongoing investigation into Mr Le Roux's management - Mr Skalbania approached
his successor, Mr David MacDonald, with an offer from Wildrose to buy the
company.
Mr MacDonald, who was appointed in 1991 at the insistence of disgruntled
creditors, agreed to consider a transaction if Wildrose could demonstrate it
had CDollars 4m in reserves and that no single shareholder would control
more than 10 per cent of the company.
This, he says, it failed to do. Concern mounted over Mr Skalbania's role
when it emerged he was facing fraud, theft and forgery charges in Canada
relating to a collapsed property deal.
Hopes that Wildrose could offer Norton refinancing opportunities through the
Alberta Stock Exchange were then dashed when the company was suspended for
failing to provide documents on its proposed takeover.
The affair culminated last September when Mr MacDonald resigned after
accusing Wildrose of trying to buy Norton at a knock-down price without
assuming any of its liabilities.
He told creditors owed more than Pounds 7m, led by Midland Bank, that he
could no longer protect the company.
Having earlier disposed of Pro-Fit and FUS, the old Norton Group was wound
up in October after Wildrose purchased the motorcycling interests.
Concern that the CDollars 1m price paid for Norton was too low has been
heightened by a Wildrose business plan which values the assets and ongoing
business at Pounds 3.7m.
Documents filed at Companies House, however, show that the takeover was not
funded by Wildrose but by loans from two Dutch finance companies: Verfin and
Waog of Amsterdam.
Both these companies are thought to be linked to Mr Roberto Aquilini, a
Skalbania business associate who controls 10 per cent of Norton and is
listed as a director.
Industry analysts fear that the loans and suspension of Wildrose on the
Alberta exchange reflect a lack of working capital behind the company.
Rozanda Skalbania, who is running Norton, is undaunted. Standing on the shop
floor at Shenstone, she says: 'Working capital is coming. It arrives when we
need it. It involves a lot of individuals who don't want their names
mentioned.'
The listing, she insists, will give the famous company the financial muscle
to expand.
Analysts are not so sure. One said yesterday: 'They are not in a position to
build anything. The factory is in a terrible state. They couldn't produce a
motorcycle even if they wanted to.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Domino Printing 24% lower at Pounds 9.1m -
Growth expected to return this year, with first quarter well ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Domino Printing Sciences rose 47p to 488p yesterday despite the
Cambridge-based continuous ink jet printer manufacturer reporting full-year
figures shy of expectations.
Mr Roger Dye, finance director, said he believed the share movement
reflected small trading volumes and confidence that the management had acted
rapidly to reverse its profits decline.
Profits before tax for the year to October 31 fell by 24 per cent to Pounds
9.1m (Pounds 11.9m) on turnover 14 per cent higher at Pounds 81.6m (Pounds
71.6m).
Earnings per share fell 23 per cent to 23.07p, compared with 30.02p. A final
dividend of 5.3p is proposed for a total of 7.95p (7.2p).
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said the increase resulted from the board's
belief that the company would return to its traditional rates of growth and
profitability this year. The first quarter of 1994 had been well ahead of
the same period in 1993.
Domino reckons to be second to Videojet, a US-based company owned by GEC, in
a market led by UK companies. Growth in recent years has been driven by UK
and European legislation requiring products to be marked with sell-by dates
and bar codes.
Continuous ink jet machines are expensive, however, and sales were badly hit
by recession, especially in the US where sales were flat. There was also
renewed competit-ion from Videojet in the US.
German sales proved disappointing and the company had merged its
distribution activities there with those of its Swiss distributor to give
better and more economic market coverage.
A diversification into mimeographic carton printing, Packtrack, cost the
company Pounds 1.1m after quality problems forced the delay of the new
product. Mr Howard Whitesmith, managing director, said a new management team
had restored quality and successful field trials had been completed in
October.
This year Domino will move into commercial laser printing. It has also
developed a new ink with a smell more acceptable to food industries.
COMMENT
So rare is it for the UK to lead in an electronics technology that Domino's
decline is disproportionately unsettling. The signs of recovery in the UK
and US are moderately encouraging but much will depend on how rapidly the
ink jet market is maturing as statutory labelling of produce loses its
novelty. The company is keen to move into new technologies, however, has
learned an expensive lesson with Packtrack and has Pounds 16.5m cash to
spend. Negotiations are in progress on unnamed potential acquisitions. The
market expects some Pounds 12m in profits before tax next year, giving about
30p of earnings and a dividend of 8.9p. At 485p, the shares are undervalued.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Shandwick climbs back to the black with
Pounds 4.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shandwick, one of the world's largest public relations companies, yesterday
announced its return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m for
the year to October 31, compared with a loss, restated for FRS 3, of Pounds
2.5m.
And the highly-indebted group has renegotiated its substantial bank
facilities over a longer period, providing it with a more stable base on
which to build its core business.
Turnover increased by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 162.5m (Pounds 157m) and
operating profit before exceptional items rose to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds
8.5m).
Shandwick has net debt of Pounds 67m and banking facilities have been
renegotiated annually.
Following a new agreement, however, it will lock into a Pounds 55m loan at a
fixed rate for three years, with a further Pounds 16m loan contin-uing on an
annual basis.
Interest payments should fall from a 1993 figure of Pounds 6.6m.
Profits have also been held back by earn-outs, or deferred acquisition
payments, which amounted to Pounds 5.6m last year.
A further Pounds 8m is due over the next four years, of which Pounds 2.2m
should fall during the current fiscal year.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman, said the outlook for 1994 was extremely positive.
The UK, continental Europe and Asia Pacific all performed ahead of budget
forecasts in the first two months.
The US, which accounts for 50 per cent of turnover, had a slower start, but
has succeeded in winning substantial new business.
Mr John Huckle, finance director, has announced his resignation and will be
replaced by Mr Roger Selman, who is currently group financial controller.
Earnings per share for the 12 months amounted to 6.4p, compared with losses
last time of 4.7p. There will be no dividend.
COMMENT
Shandwick is one of the few media agencies to survive the recession without
a restructuring and, with new banking facilities in place, it is emerging
from a position of relative strength. Profits will be sustained over the
next two years as the torrent of earn-out payments peter out. Analysts are
forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m for the current year, representing
a p/e of 7.8, rising to some Pounds 8.5m in 1995. Concern will focus on a
possible rights issue to reduce debt levels, but with fresh bank facilities
and positive cash flow, Shandwick can now afford to wait for a further
recovery in its share price.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Beauford finance restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beauford, the West Yorkshire-based engineering and ceramics group, yesterday
announced it had conditionally agreed a conversion of bank borrowings, a
placing and a rights issue.
Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, said that without the debt conversion and
the cash injection resulting from the placing and rights issue, and in the
absence of continuing bank support, directors believed the group would be
unable to continue trading.
Under the terms of the proposed refinancing, holders of the ordinary shares
would receive one new 10p share for every 20 ordinary shares held. In
addition, the group's bankers have agreed that Pounds 5m of borrowings owed
to them be converted into 10m new preference shares and 10m new convertible
preference shares. The banks have also agreed to convert a further Pounds 2m
of debt into a Pounds 2m term loan and to provide new committed facilities
for the company, subject to the implementation of the proposals.
In conjunction with the debt conversion, Beauford proposes to raise some
Pounds 4m before expenses by way of a placing of 11.8m new ordinary shares
with institutional investors and a fully underwritten rights issue of 8.16m
new shares at 20p apiece to shareholders on a 1-for-10 basis.
A subdivision of each deferred share into two deferred shares of  1/2 p each
and the ordinary shares into one new share of  1/2 p and one deferred share
of  1/2 p is also proposed. The new ordinary shares will then be
consolidated on the basis of one new ordinary share of 10p for every 20 new
 1/2 p shares. The deferred shares, which will have negligible value, will
then be cancelled.
The net proceeds of the placing and rights issue, amounting to some Pounds
3.3m, will be used to reduce bank borrowings.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Butte AGM ends with demand for poll on
resolutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long and acrimonious annual meeting of Butte Mining in London yesterday
ended with some shareholders demanding a poll on all the resolutions put
before them. The outcome will not be known for at least three weeks.
Butte's main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits - it is seeking damages of
up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from former managers and promoters - and
several of the shareholder-defendants were at yesterday's meeting.
They included Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who was a promoter
and former director of Butte, and his daughter, Fiona. But, unlike many of
his former colleagues, he remained silent during the meeting and refused to
comment afterwards.
However, many of the questions posed at the meeting came from Newsham
Investments, which is understood to be an offshore vehicle for the Smith
family interests.
Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said the 'unusual' Butte articles of
association gave 30 days for a poll result to be announced, so he intended
to write to all shareholders urging them to vote and return proxies within
21 days.
It emerged after the two-hour meeting that there are questions about a key
7.9 per cent block of Butte shares, once owned by Mr Smith but taken by
Societe Banquaire de Paris, apparently when he fell behind with loan
payments.
Butte discovered at the weekend that these shares had changed ownership, but
the company had not been notified - suggesting a possible breach of UK
company law. Butte has begun formal moves to establish the beneficial
ownership of the shares.
Another big block of Butte shares, 7 per cent, is controlled by
Edinburgh-based Waverley Mining Finance. Mr Willie McLucas, Waverley's
managing director, said after the meeting he was undecided about how to cast
his votes.
His remarks during the meeting made it clear he did not see eye to eye with
the present board - particularly over the question of the value of Butte's
former assets in Australia. On the other hand, Mr McLucas said he did not
particularly want to line up with the defendant-shareholder group.
Mr Lloyd-Jacob was closely questioned about the holders of unique loan notes
issued to raise about Pounds 1.3m in November which give the holders a share
in any litigation proceeds and a charge over all the company's assets. He
said some of the holders had asked not to be identified, which caused Mr
Keith Anderson, representing one of the nominee shareholders, to complain:
'It is the loan note holders, a body not identified to ordinary
shareholders, that control this company.'
Mr Lloyd-Jacob said an out-of-court settlement of the US litigation was
'improbable.' He added: 'Any want of prosecution is a default on the loan
stock. While the company can be bid for and management thrown out, it will
not be an easy matter to shut down the law suit.'
The chairman was not without his supporters. One commented: 'It is because
of this management's efforts that the company is still in existence when
some might feel it was designed to disappear, to be just another corporate
casualty.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EDS stake in Ibos opens the door for other
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander announced yesterday that EDS, the
data services company, had bought a 32 per cent stake in Ibos, their
cross-border electronic banking system, as part of a plan to open it to
other banks.
The two banks said that Ibos, a system which allows banks to transfer cash
between accounts in different countries within seconds, would in future be
open to any bank which paid a subscription fee of about Pounds 50,000 a
year.
Some 5 per cent of the new company established to market Ibos as a
technology platform will be owned by Goldman Sachs, the financial adviser to
Ibos. The remaining 95 per cent will be split equally by the two founding
banks and EDS.
Bank executives yesterday declined to say how much EDS and Goldman were
paying for their stakes. However, shares in the new Ibos company are thought
to have been priced at a premium to the Pounds 8m so far invested in its
development.
The founding banks said that EDS, which provides technology services to
7,000 companies around the world, was offered an equity stake because of its
technical resources and ability to market the system among its other
services.
Banks that use Ibos to transfer funds rather than systems such as Swift, the
Brussels-based funds transfer system owned by banks, will pay a fee per
transaction. The Ibos partners believe that it will be cheaper than its
competitors.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Equity finance sought for Ferranti buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The team of Ferranti International managers which is preparing a bid for the
bulk of the collapsed defence electronics group is seeking equity finance to
back either a full management and employee buy-out, or the
management/employee element of a consortium bid.
A brochure outlining the management team's planshas been sent to
institutions and banks.
The seven-man team, led by Mr Phil Burton, Ferranti's director of marketing,
told the company's UK employees yesterday that 'discussions with
institutions start this week'.
The team is also exploring possible trade partners, 'including companies
from the UK and overseas'.
However, in a 'progress report' to employees the team, dubbed Newco, said
that press reports of a Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m price for Ferranti 'do not
come from Newco management and are not representative of the value we place
on the businesses'.
Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the administrative receivers from
Arthur Andersen who were appointed to the ailing group after GEC withdrew a
1p a share rescue bid in December, have welcomed the proposed management
buy-out and other bids.
The management team, which is advised by Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Corporate Finance, said it understood there had been 200 expressions
of interest in part or all of Ferranti.
'The Newco plans are now complete,' the management team said. 'They show a
company which is profitable and capable of generating cash, although it
needs early investment in people, products and facilities.'
In the meantime Ferranti is continuing trading and won Pounds 1.8m of new
orders last month.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cadbury in link-up for European expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes has joined forces with Cott, Canada's largest soft drinks
company, to compete in the fast-growing continental European market for
private-label beverages sold by supermarkets.
The two companies have signed a five-year agreement, under which Cadbury
bottling plants will produce drinks for a newly-formed Cott subsidiary in
Europe. Cadbury has an option to acquire up to 49 per cent of the
subsidiary.
As well as marking Cott's entry into Europe, the agreement will enable
Cadbury to increase production at its bottling plants, several of which have
spare capacity. The company has plants in Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal
and Spain.
Though the deal is small, some industry observers said yesterday that it
could lead to longer-term strains on Cadbury's existing network of
relationships with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the world's largest soft drinks
companies.
Coke and Pepsi are fighting to check rapid market share increases in the US
by private-label colas, of which Cott is the leading producer. Private-label
beverages are also gaining ground in British, French and Spanish
supermarkets.
Coca-Cola bottlers produce some Cadbury soft drinks in the US, and the
companies jointly own Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, Brit-ain's biggest
soft drinks producer.
The UK is excluded from Cadbury's agreement with Cott.
Cadbury bottles Pepsi products in southern Spain and France and the
companies recently began co-operating to sell soft drinks in eastern Europe,
a region which is covered by the Cott agreement.
The deal is the latest in a series of recent moves by Cadbury to expand its
beverages business internationally.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rowland to retain Lonrho shares until price
recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland said yesterday that he would not be a seller of his
remaining Lonrho shares until the market price reached between 250p and
350p.
Following yesterday's results, the share price moved in the right direction
for him, closing up 8p to 153p.
'Why should the shares not go back to the level of their pre-Maxwell days?',
he asked. In the months after Mr Robert Maxwell died in November 1991, there
was a sharp fall in the share prices of companies run by powerful
entrepreneurs such as Mr Rowland.
It was this plunge which allowed Lonrho's joint chief executive, Mr Dieter
Bock, to acquire an 18.8 per cent stake in the group at the beginning of
last year for an average price of less than 100p a share.
The important indicators of financial performance and balance sheet strength
improved at the company in the year to September 30. The ratio of debt to
equity fell from 57 per cent to 31 per cent. Net borrowings were Pounds 446m
(down from Pounds 849m a year earlier, thanks largely to disposals),
compared with net assets of Pounds 1.42bn.
Because of the diluting effect of last year's rights issue, net assets per
share were 138p, down from 158p. The company pointed out that its 45 per
cent shareholding in Ashanti Goldfields is valued in its balance sheet at
Pounds 89m, compared with a possible market value of more than Pounds 400m
when Ashanti is floated later this year.
Mr Bock said that Lonrho would not be selling any of its shares in the
flotation.
Over the past year, Mr Bock has reorganised Lonrho into four divisions:
mining, agriculture, hotels and general trade. There was an improving profit
performance from all of them.
Mining pushed up pre-tax profits by 60 per cent to Pounds 40m on turnover of
Pounds 335m (Pounds 313m); pre-tax profits from hotels rose from Pounds 1m
to Pounds 12m on Pounds 260m (Pounds 218m); general trade more than doubled
its contribution from Pounds 5m to Pounds 11m on Pounds 196m (Pounds 174m);
and there was a 50 per cent improvement in pre-tax earnings in the
agricultural division to Pounds 12m.
The group became even more dependent on Africa during the year. The
continent generated Pounds 69m of the Pounds 79m of pre-tax profits from
continuing operations against Pounds 44m a year earlier.
Capital expenditure is on a sharply declining trend. It was Pounds 121m,
down from Pounds 173m in 1992, and is forecast by the company at less than
Pounds 100m in the current year. Mr Bock said that the company had
eliminated most of its loss-making businesses.
However, last year's pre-tax profits were depressed by the legal costs of
the company's long running dispute with the Egyptian Fayed brothers - which
was settled in October - over the Fayed's 1985 purchase of House of Fraser
department stores. Lonrho's legal expenses were less than Pounds 5m in the
year justended, all of it charged against the profits of continuing
operations.
In the current financial period, there is likely to be a charge of around
Pounds 1.5m from payments to be made to four directors who are leaving the
company.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Photo-Me in Pounds 38m purchase - French
acquisition gives access to advanced technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and
operator, plans to pay Pounds 38m for a French company with technology which
it believes will dominate the world market for self-service photography.
KIS, based in Grenoble, has developed a booth which uses digital electronic
technology. Customers can view themselves on a video screen and then freeze
their favourite pose, receiving colour or black and white prints in a
variety of formats.
Photo-Me said the new generation of automatic booths offered significantly
better picture quality than conventional booths, and more permanent pictures
than those provided by Photo-Me's thermal electronic booths.
Customers can also have their pictures taken with images of
digitally-generated 'partners' such as film stars. A modem in each booth
will notify a central computer about stock levels and breakdowns.
'The technology also offers the scope for substantial reductions in the
capital costs of individual booths and the cost of consumables,' Photo-Me
said. Prototypes of the new booth are currently undergoing field testing in
France.
Mr Dan David, chairman of Photo-Me, said: 'Whilst the immediate impact of
the merger will be to dilute marginally earnings per share in the current
financial year, we believe that the benefits of the transaction will begin
to be felt in the following financial year.'
Mr Serge Crasnianski, founder and chairman of KIS, is already a
non-executive director of Photo-Me, and his company is one of the UK's
company's biggest shareholders.
Photo-Me yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.5m for the six
months to October 31 on unchanged sales of Pounds 71.9m. It described the
result as encouraging since the previous period's profits had been inflated
by a Pounds 1.33m foreign exchange gain.
The board saw some signs of recovery from the worldwide recession and
believed that, subject to there being no material movement in exchange
rates, trading performance in the second half of the current year would be
satisfactory.
'Trading in the UK and US, in particular, is starting to edge ahead and the
downturns in continental Europe and Japan appear to have reached their low
points.'
Earnings per share dipped to 10.7p (10.76p), but the interim dividend is
lifted by 7.1 per cent to 1.5p (1.4p).
COMMENT
Photo-Me's shares rose by 5p to 310p as analysts welcomed a deal which
appears to make sense. The technology acquired seems to have real potential,
although buying a product before it is in mass production must involve some
degree of risk. KIS reported only modest pre-tax profits of Pounds 600,000
on sales of Pounds 44m in 1992. However, Photo-Me is confident that - as a
private company - profitability was not KIS's main concern, and this return
can be improved. The deal certainly adds some interest to Photo-Me, which
had seemed rather lacklustre, but it will be some time before the picture on
possible rationalisation and operational savings becomes clear.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports valued at Pounds 211m in
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alpha Airports Group, now trading as the airport services division of Forte,
finalised its flotation yesterday, pricing its shares at 140p to produce a
market capitalisation of Pounds 211.1m.
Forte will retain a 25 per cent stake in the company.
A total of 113.09m ordinary shares are being placed. Half will be firmly
placed with institutions, while the remaining 25 per cent (39.58m shares)
will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, said he believed the flotation would provide
a firm base for the long term development of Alpha. The Pounds 177.4m
proceeds would be used to reduce Forte's borrowings and would enable it 'to
continue the development of our core hotel and restaurant businesses'.
The total value of the flotation to Forte, including Alpha's assumption of
total debts of Pounds 30m, is Pounds 241m.
Mr Paul Harrison, chief executive of Alpha, said the flotation would provide
the new company with a springboard for further development. He is expecting
to announce at least two flight catering joint ventures in the coming year.
Earlier this month Alpha forecast a 19 per cent rise in operating profits
for the year to January 31 to Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 17.3m) on turnover of
Pounds 423.1m (Pounds 404.5m).
Alpha's business is divided almost equally between catering for airlines and
retail trading at airports. It expects profits of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds
13.1m) from the catering side on turnover of Pounds 210.1m (Pounds 197.5m).
The retail side's turnover is expected to be Pounds 213m (Pounds 207m) with
operating profits of Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 4.2m).
Pro forma earnings per share are 8.75p, giving a p/e of 16. Notional
dividend is 4.03p for a gross yield of 3.6 per cent. UBS are sponsors to the
flotation.
COMMENT
Alpha is two distinct businesses that happen to operate at airports. The
flight catering side looks set for continuing growth alongside increased
international travel. It can also be argued that the consolidation of the
airline industry will favour larger caterers. On the other hand, increased
competition between airlines could lead to economies on catering. The retail
side, much less profitable, needs to find a way forward when duty free
shopping is due to end in the EU in 1999. With the City expecting earnings
to grow to about 10p a share in the coming year, the price looks pitched
about right both for Forte and potential investors.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Caledonian to buy Bank of Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caledonian Trust, a property investment company, intends to buy Bank of
Edinburgh, the financial services company set up three years ago to buy
small building societies, in order to use its remaining capital.
Caledonian said it intended to make an offer equivalent to the net asset
value of Bank of Edinburgh, thought to be about Pounds 4m. It would use what
remains of the company's original Pounds 8m capital to invest in property.
The offer was disclosed after the announcement that Bank of Edinburgh had
given up its banking licence and was considering returning capital to
shareholders. This followed its failure to acquire the Heart of England
Building Society.
Mr Michael Baynham, an executive director of Caledonian Trust, said that it
would make a formal offer following due diligence of Bank of Edinburgh. The
offer would value it as a shell company with unused capital resources.
The board of Bank of Edinburgh has recommended that any offer be put to
shareholders, including Scottish Amicable, which holds a 39 per cent stake.

<TEXT>
PLA, the Dutch holding company, has sold half of its 6m shareholding in IWP,
the Irish industrial holding company, in a deal estimated to be worth some
IPounds 12m (Pounds 11.5m).
The shares were acquired by PLA in November last year as part of a complex
IPounds 51m acquisition by IWP of Levendaal Beheer, a PLA subsidiary, in
which PLA subscribed for 6m new ordinary shares in IWP at 308p each.
It is understood that yesterday's sale of the shares to Dillon Reed
Securities of the US, was at about 390p per share. Dillon has placed the
shares with other institutions.
The terms of the original acquisition were that any sale of the new shares
by PLA would require the prior consent of IWP. In a statement yesterday, IWP
said it has agreed to the sale of half of the 6m holding, and that the
company welcomed the broadening of its shareholder base.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cantors advances to Pounds 563,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved trading and tight control of overheads and margins enabled Cantors,
the furniture retailer, to report profits ahead from Pounds 175,000 to
Pounds 563,000 in the 26 weeks to October 23.
However, Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said that trading in the second half
had been difficult, affected by the uncertainty created by the November
Budget.
He added that new year sales had started well and if the trend continued
there would be an acceptable improvement in full year profits.
Mr Cantor said that the experimental format of trading in retail parks was
continuing satisfactorily. One was opened in the period under review with
two more in December. Three more are planned before the end of the financial
year.
The shares rose 10p to 340p.
Turnover rose by 4 per cent from Pounds 28.7m to Pounds 29.8m. Trading
profit was almost doubled at Pounds 656,000 (Pounds 336,000). The pre-tax
result was helped by lower net interest charges of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds
161,000).
Earnings per share came out at 2.42p (0.76p). The interim dividend is
maintained at 1p.

FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Weir continues move into oil and gas valve
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weir Group is buying Valflow Engineering, a Derbyshire-based manufacturer of
ball valves for the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, for an
undisclosed sum.
The deal is part of Weir's expansion into the oil and gas valve business.
Valflow will be run as a satellite division of the group's Hopkinsons valve
operation, and its management team will continue to run the business.
Valflow has annual sales of about Pounds 2m and was placed in receivership
in November after hitting problems on a contract with British Gas.
Weir bought the company from the receivers, KPMG Peat Marwick.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Time running out for the bond market bulls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is now more than three months since the 30-year US Treasury bond yield
hit a low of 5.78 per cent and bounced back up by half a percentage point.
Recently the long bond yield has fluctuated quietly around 6.3 per cent.
Time is running out for the bulls who have counted on US Treasuries to
regain and surpass their price peaks.
More recently there has been a sharp break in the Japanese bond market where
the 10-year yield jumped from 2.96 per cent to almost 3.40 per cent in a few
days in the middle of this month. The latest on-off reflation package has
upset the JGB market with its threat of massive extra borrowing although, in
a funny way, the bond market can gain some comfort from the government's
disarray, because the flood of paper is being postponed.
Together the US and Japan account for 60 per cent of the capitalisation of
the worldwide government bond market, so there is increasing evidence for
calling the turn in the global bull market. European bonds, however, still
have something going for them.
UK gilts looked as though they were suffering something of the same January
reaction as JGBs, but increasing optimism about a fall-off in the rate of
issuance next year has allowed long gilt yields to claw their way back
almost to the December 31 lows. Today's auction of Pounds 2 3/4 bn of a
16-year gilt will give a clue to the robustness of demand.
As for the Continental countries, they are lagging in the economic cycle and
with short-term interest rates having quite a way to fall, there is still
scope for domestic money to shift into the bond markets. All the same, after
dropping from 7 1/4 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent last year, the 10-year yield
on German bunds does not have all that much further to go, and indeed has
itself backed up a little this month.
The global deflation story, which has had bond investors salivating, looks
rather tired now. Although the weakness of the oil price has been holding
down inflation, many other commodity prices have been picking up. Global
economic growth is slowly increasing now. Rapid expansion continues, in
fact, in the emerging economies, which will soon be large enough to have a
significant effect on commodity demand.
Central governments have been pumping large amounts of liquidity into the
international economy. True, this infusion does not show up in the broad
money figures, which indicate growth of only about 3 per cent averaged
across the Group of Seven economies. This is because the liquidity has
disappeared into the booming securities markets and thereby largely into
repayment of short-term corporate debt.
It is worth noting, though, that narrow money has recently been growing at
an annual rate of 10 per cent in the US and 6 per cent in the UK (and broad
money growth, too, is now accelerating in the UK).
Eighteen months ago a short-term interest rate of 3 per cent may have been
justifiable in the US, but it is now inappropriate when this Friday's
statistics may well show that money GNP has recently been growing at 7 per
cent year-on-year. Inflation is, of course, steady; but it only responds to
monetary acceleration with a time lag of something like two years.
However, having got here, the US Federal Reserve has no easy way back. A
sharp hike in short-term interest rates might perversely cause a rapid
acceleration in broad money growth as investors moved back into deposits,
and unpredictable damage would be done to the value of long-term assets;
equities would be vulnerable to a rising yield ratio. But a cautious edging
up in rates might be little better, because investors would assume it was
only a taster for the real thing.
If the Fed persists with masterful inactivity it will remain in a
comfortable position for the time being, perhaps for the rest of the year.
But doing nothing will not be a soft option indefinitely; the US bond market
will sweat increasingly about the inflationary implications for a year or
two out.
But whatever the immediate effect on market sentiment of a rise in
short-term rates, logically an anti-inflationary stance by the Fed will
favour bonds in the medium term; that would be the friendly advice of the
Bundesbank, anyhow, if only it were to be asked.

FT  26 JAN 94 / IBM profit fails to spur shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines reported a small profit for its fourth
quarter, after six consecutive quarters of losses. Yet with revenues and
gross profit margins continuing to decline, the results provided little
evidence of a turnround by the world's largest computer company.
IBM's share price fell sharply, trading at Dollars 55 7/8 at midday in New
York, down from Monday's close of Dollars 58 5/8 . It regained some ground
in the afternoon but closed down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 58 1/4.
Fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 382m, or 62 cents a share, in line with
analysts' expectations. In the corresponding period IBM recorded a net loss
of Dollars 45m, or 8 cents a share, before pre-tax restructuring charges of
Dollars 7.2bn which increased net losses to Dollars 5.5bn, or Dollars 9.57
per share.
Sales declined in the fourth quarter from Dollars 19.6bn to Dollars 19.4bn.
However, computer hardware sales fell by 5.4 per cent to Dollars 10.4bn.
Revenue declines in software, maintenance and financing were offset by a 32
per cent increase on the service side. US sales rose by 9 per cent, but
Europe and Asia decreased by 1 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.
Gross profit margins slipped by 1.1 percentage points to 38.2 per cent.
Expenses were down 9 per cent, excluding restructuring charges but including
interest costs. Research and development spending was cut by 20 per cent.
Analysts said the results, although encouraging, did not necessarily signal
a recovery for IBM. The revenue decline was disappointing because IBM
typically did about 30 per cent of its business in the last quarter.
'IBM was profitable in the fourth quarter despite tough business
environments in Europe and Japan,' said Mr Louis Gerstner, who joined as
chairman and chief executive last April. Progress was being made both on
profitability and on business and technology strategies.
IBM said personal computer revenues rose strongly in the quarter and
computer workstation sales increased. However, revenues from the flagship
mainframe computers and related disk drive products declined.
For the year, IBM reported a net loss of Dollars 8.1bn, or Dollars 14.02 a
share, after restructuring charges. Net losses for 1992 were Dollars 5bn, or
Dollars 8.70, after an accounting change and restructuring charges. Revenues
for the year declined from Dollars 64.5bn to Dollars 62.7bn, with non-US
activities down 7.2 per cent at Dollars 37bn.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Bock wins upper hand at Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Bock yesterday won his most important victory in the battle
against fellow chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland for control of the Lonrho
board room when the company announced that four of Mr Rowland's closest
board room allies would retire.
The group also disclosed that profits from continuing operations had more
than doubled in the year to September 30 from Pounds 39m to Pounds 79m.
It confirmed, however, that there had been a Pounds 186m fall in the value
of its two-thirds shareholding in the Metropole hotels, which represents a
reduction of more than 50 per cent on the value put on the business two
years ago when Lonrho sold one third of it to Libya.
As Mr Bock's victory was disclosed, Mr Rowland said hostilities had ended.
'There are no differences between Mr Bock and me. . . We will be acting as
one,' Mr Rowland said. 'I could not be happier.'
Mr Bock said: 'I look forward to at least another two years of our working
closely together.'
Mr Rowland said the relationship between Mr Bock and himself would be
similar to that between Lord White and Lord Hanson at the conglomerate
Hanson. 'My area is principally Africa (where Lonrho has many businesses).
We meet and decide which opportunities we should put to the board.'
Mr Rowland disclosed that Lonrho had recently considered acquiring a
shareholding of 15-18 per cent in the hotels and leisure group, Ladbroke,
when its share price fell. Mr Bock said they had decided against the move
because such a minority stake would not have allowed them to exercise enough
influence on Ladbroke.
However, he said Lonrho, having made a series of disposals last year, was
now planning to make acquisitions - though more asset sales might still be
made.
One of the retiring directors is Mr Rene Leclezio, the chairman, who is 74
and has worked for Lonrho for 29 years. Mr Bock said that he would be
replaced by a non-executive chairman, who might come from outside the group
or from one of the three non-executive directors, Mr Stephen Walls, Mr Peter
Harper and Sir John Leahy, recently recruited to the board.
Last year the company also offered seats on the board to Sir Alastair
Morton, joint chairman of Eurotunnel, Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief
executive of Postel, the UK's biggest pension fund, and Mr Brian Pearse,
retiring chief executive of Midland. They declined, though are thought not
to have dismissed the suggestion completely.
The retiring directors will receive payments equivalent to two years'
salary, which will have to be approved by shareholders at the annual meeting
at the end of March.
The group's pre-tax profit, including gains on disposals, was Pounds 172m,
up from Pounds 114m, on sales of Pounds 2.7bn, compared with Pounds 3.93bn.
Earnings per share were 15.1p, against 6.4p, before exceptional items, or
2.4p against a loss of 0.9p afterwards. A final dividend of 2p makes an
unchanged total of 4p. Net interest costs fell from Pounds 100m to Pounds
70m.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Spanish banks jib at Banesto rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition is growing among Spain's private banks to making a large
contribution to the rescue of Banco Espanol de Credito, despite efforts by
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor, to gain their support.
Mr Rojo yesterday met the chairmen of the top five private banks to present
them with proposals drawn up by Banesto's management to restructure its
capital and relaunch the bank following intervention by the central bank a
month ago.
The private banks believe they are being asked to carry an excessive burden
to refloat Banesto. While they are prepared to help with Banesto's
restructuring, they are unwilling to participate in a venture that could
turn Banesto into a powerful rival.
'We thought we were going to be asked to refloat a cruiser but it turns out
we will be asked to build an aircraft carrier,' said one senior bank
executive.
The Spanish Banking Association said yesterday that the over-valuation of
Banesto's assets according to the latest estimate was Pta605bn (Pounds
2.8bn). This compares with an estimate of Pta 675bn disclosed by a Banesto
spokesman last week.
Private banks could be asked to give up to Pta200bn to Spain's Deposit
Guarantee Fund. This would underwrite a capital increase, although the
equity might eventually be floated.
The troubled bank, according to bankers in Madrid, will contribute to its
own rescue by allocating all its Pta245bn reserves into provisions and
reducing the nominal value of its shares from Pta700 to Pta500.
Under the draft plan Banesto's capital increase would have been
Pta120-Pta150bn and the acquisition of bad debts, to be shared with the Bank
of Spain, would have represented at most Pta200bn.
The Bank of Spain report triggering its intervention put Banesto's gross
financing needs at Pta503bn. The latest Pta605bn estimate could climb
further.
US regulators are to investigate the investment rules guiding credit unions
after US Central Credit Union, a Kansas-based institution that acts as a
central bank to other credit unions, placed Dollars 255m in an uninsured
Banesto certificate of deposit, writes George Graham in Washington.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Expectations 'too high' for return on capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are demanding too high a return on capital when considering
investment projects, according to Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of
economics and strategy at BZW, the securities house.
His comments accompanied yesterday's publication of BZW's annual equity-gilt
study, which looks at returns from UK shares, government bonds and cash
since 1918. He said that companies had not adjusted to lower inflation rates
in their appraisal of capital spending. Typically, he added, they expected
returns of 20-25 per cent, but they should be looking at a return of 10-15
per cent before inflation. If they did, investment could rise.
The real return on equities from 1918 to the end of 1993 had been 7.9 per
cent a year on average, Mr Hughes explained.
BZW estimates the real cost of equity capital to have been 7-10 per cent on
average and sees 8 per cent as a benchmark.
Assuming a future inflation rate, implied from the relationship between
index-linked and conventional gilts, of about 3 1/2 per cent, a nominal
return of 10-15 per cent would allow companies to approximately cover their
cost of capital.
The study also suggested that UK shares, which produced a total real return
of 25 per cent in 1993, were modestly over-valued compared with a model of
equity valuation based on dividend yield and expected growth in income.
This follows a prolonged period of undervaluation between 1973 and 1985,
while from 1986 to 1992 equities moved much in line with the model.
Mr Hughes said that the shift to being overvalued in 1993 did not signal an
end to the bull market. From 1958 to 1972 equities were overvalued to a much
greater extent. If the market returned to the peak overvaluation of 1968 the
FT-SE 100 index would stand at 5,500.
There were two key conditions for equities to be re-rated, both of which
held at present, Mr Hughes stated. These were a stimulative monetary policy
and profits rising as a proportion of gross domestic product. If these
persisted, he said, equities should remain overvalued and could become more
overvalued.
Gilts marginally outperformed equities in 1993, producing a return of 26.4
per cent, and making gilts the winner in three of the last five years.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Japanese economy slides as reform row grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's politicians were confronted with official evidence yesterday that
the country's economy continues to worsen as they engage in a protracted
squabble over government proposals to reform the corruption-prone electoral
system.
Economic conditions are now 'sluggish overall', according to the latest
report from the Economic Planning Agency, the government forecaster. That
represents another downward revision since an optimistic claim last June
that the downturn had bottomed out.
The change, from the EPA's previous report that there were positive as well
as negative signs, adds renewed urgency to the government's attempts to draw
up economic stimulus measures, delayed by the crisis over political reform.
It also increases pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary conditions,
as has been demanded by a worried Keidanren, the business federation.
A parliamentary panel has little chance of agreeing on a new electoral
system in time for the full Diet to vote on it before its session ends on
Saturday.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, who heads a fragile seven-party
coalition, has hinted at resignation if the measures fail. But the severity
of the recession is prompting calls for him to minimise disruption by
staying on whatever happens.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister, said the
government planned to decide on a rough outline of an economic stimulus by
February 10, the day before Mr Hosokawa is to meet US president Bill Clinton
in Washington.
The EPA's leading business index, a measure of economic prospects over the
months ahead, stood at 30 in November, its seventh month below 50, the
dividing line between growth and decline. November's figure was up on
October's 27.5.
However, two important components of the November index showed declines. The
outlook for money supply weakened, breaking a 12-month trend, while housing
starts, formerly one of the few bright patches in the economy, ended a
five-month rise.
Two inconclusive signs of improvement came with an upturn in purchases of
machinery by private sector companies and the first rise in job offers for
three months.
Separate evidence of the continued weakness in consumer demand was also
announced, with a 6.6 per cent decline in department store sales for 1993.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Motorists a target for 'green' taxes, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that more 'green' taxes
could be on the way as he unveiled the government's long-awaited policy
statement on safeguarding the environment into the next century.
Indicating that road pricing and higher motor fuel taxes were prime targets,
Mr Major said that 'sometimes quite painful political action may be
necessary to meet environmental objectives'.
'People may not always be able to make journeys as easily or as cheaply as
before - (they) will have to reconcile their desire for travel with their
desire to protect the environment for future generations,' he said.
Earlier this week, Professor David Pearce, head of environmental economics
at London University and a former government adviser, criticised the
government for charging road users too little.
In research published tomorrow he says the 'social cost' of road use -
pollution, congestion and accidents - has been between Pounds 23bn and
Pounds 26bn a year, twice the amount raised in taxes on road users.
Yesterday's publication of four strategy papers - together nearly 500 pages
long - fulfils one of the government's commitments made at the Rio Earth
Summit in June 1992. They set out the UK's policy on climate change,
biodiversity (preserving the diversity of the world's plants and animals),
forests and sustainable development.
Mr Major also announced that a panel would be set up to give the government
'frank, external advice of the very highest quality' on environmental
issues. The panel, which will meet four times a year, will be headed by Sir
Crispin Tickell, Warden of Green College, Oxford, and former British
permanent representative to the United Nations.
The other members are Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank;
Lord Selborne, chairman of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the
government's conservation advisers; Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution; and Ms Anne Mclaren, foreign
secretary of the Royal Society.
Opposition MPs and environmentalists attacked the reports for failing to
draw up new policies or specify targets. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's
environment spokesman, said: 'It is all very well to set up distinguished
committees, but that does not amount to very much action.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / Meat traders cut into City's power base in Smithfield feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smithfield market's meat traders celebrated an historic electoral
breakthrough yesterday in a long-running feud with their landlords, the
Corporation of London.
Two of their number - Mr John Brewster, chairman of Smithfield Market
Tenants' Association, and Mr Peter Martinelli, head of the association's
meat division - won seats on the City's general council in a by-election.
They now have a firm platform to argue their case over who should pay for
the Pounds 60m refurbishment of Smithfield's elderly buildings, needed to
comply with European Union regulations.
The dispute has now dragged on for a decade and may force a change in the
City's medieval constitution.
The traders say their beloved market, which has operated from at least the
12th century, might be forced to close if rent rises of between 85 per cent
and 145 per cent are enforced.
But more than money is at stake. The traders believe they can win several
more City wards where election turnouts are normally fewer than 100, simply
by establishing offices in them. In one, they believe the entire turnout at
the last election came from one accountancy firm.
Under its centuries-old constitution, only residents, partnerships and sole
traders may vote. Large corporations which provide the city's lifeblood have
no say.
But the City has a contingency plan aimed at preventing the traders from
'packing' elections. It could extend the vote to limited companies, although
this would need an act of parliament.
Yesterday, the new councillors' first act was to summon their well-heeled
colleagues for a conference, followed by a meat buffet, at Butchers' Hall
near Smithfield.
Mr Martinelli angrily denied the City's claim that it will be subsidising
the market by Pounds 2m each year under the terms of its current offer to
tenants.
He said: 'Anyone can create panic in the enemy if you tell lies or make
grand statements with no backup. When they show me what the subsidy is we'll
make adjustments accordingly. There is no subsidy.'
City officials maintained their claim: 'It is absolute nonsense to suggest
that we are not offering a genuine and generous subsidy.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte must be glad it did not sell its Gardner Merchant catering business to
Compass. The terms of the Alpha airport group flotation put a price tag on
the total business, including the contract catering buy-out and the 25 per
cent stake Forte has retained, of over Pounds 700m. That is some Pounds 200m
more than Compass would have paid. Moreover, after the Alpha deal, Forte's
balance sheet will look more comfortable. Gearing will fall to little more
than 40 per cent and interest cover will rise above two times. But that
still begs the question of whether Forte was right to sell.
A degree of ambivalence is indicated by its continuing stakes. The technical
reason is that Forte's presence helps ensure existing contracts with
customers will be retained. Forte, though, also aims to share in profits
growth. Alpha's prospects are limited by its duty-free involvement and the
rigorous demands of its airline customers, while contract catering has less
room for cyclical recovery than hotels. Yet both are cash-generative
businesses with scope for expansion. It will be interesting to see if
Gardner Merchant's eventual flotation reveals a performance better than that
which Forte has managed in hotels.

FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Cost of capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With rate of return on investment a hot topic with the utilities, the
statistics in BZW's annual equity-gilt study make interesting reading.
Unfortunately, there is a large deviation between the two main ways of
calculating the cost of capital. The dividend discount model gives an
estimate around 7 per cent while the capital asset-pricing model produces a
figure of around 10 per cent.
In tending towards the lower figure BZW seeks to resolve the problem by
suggesting that the risk-free real interest rates of 2-4 per cent, often
used in the CAPM, are too high. It thinks long-run real rates may be as low
as 1.2 per cent. If true, that suggests a brighter outlook for gilts, and
hence equities, than many now fear.
Yet if the overall market is supported, there is a question over the likely
level of corporate investment. It is striking that, in the past, two-thirds
of total returns on equities have come from dividends. This UK bias towards
draining cash has arguably led to under-investment and a smaller capital
stock than might otherwise have been possible. Looking forward the study
suggests that companies have not adjusted their hurdle rates of return to
reflect lower inflation and financing costs. Profitable investment
opportunities may thus be missed. That particularly applies to banks, whose
high hurdle rates and central role in credit creation may be particularly
important. The risk is that investment may be curbed because gun-shy banks
are trying to fill in the holes they dug for themselves in the last cycle.

FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing in yesterday's restructuring announcement makes Fisons' future
easier to judge. The company has come up with Pounds 35m annual cost savings
in pharmaceuticals by 1996, perhaps Pounds 10m more than the stock market
expected. Efficiencies in management and manufacturing should allow
development spending to be maintained despite the poor trading performance.
The sales force has also been spared the worst. Growing competition in
asthma therapy from Glaxo - and Zeneca before long - demands that the
marketing effort is maintained.
Yet the salesforce may look under-employed within two years unless Fisons
can conjure something from its research pipeline or, more likely, licenses a
good product from outside. Intal, its biggest-selling drug, faces
competition from cheaper generic alternatives this year. Although the
precise timing and impact are matters for guesswork, sales will surely
suffer. The US launch of Tilade, Fisons' new asthma treatment, appears to be
going well enough. But it is too early to pass judgment. Until this shortage
of new products is addressed, the suspicion remains that yesterday's round
of pruning alone will not be enough.
Meanwhile the loss-making instruments division is under the microscope. That
points to more restructuring provisions to come, possibly with the 1993
figures in March. With the stock market transfixed by the chances of a bid,
though, the red ink is unlikely to unsettle the shares. A rating in line
with that of Glaxo is otherwise difficult to justify.

FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tiny steps forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho still looks a sorry sight even after Mr Dieter Bock's revamp. The
dividend is not covered by earnings from continuing operations. Cash
generation from continuing operations of Pounds 126m is barely sufficient to
pay the company's interest, dividend and tax bill, even before it begins to
consider its dwindling capital expenditure. Nor is Lonrho making much of a
return from its vaunted core businesses. Hotel assets have been written down
to Pounds 621m, but even so the operating return is only 3 per cent. Only in
general trading, whatever that is supposed to mean, is the return a
respectable 21 per cent.
Mr Bock deserves credit for increasing the transparency of Lonrho's
accounts, initiating disposals and restructuring the board. Yet the task of
turning the company round remains gargantuan. Though Lonrho expects to
squeeze more cash out of working capital this year, more disposals may be
needed just to keep gearing around its present level of 31 per cent. Without
disposals there can certainly be no question of acquisitions. Perhaps that
is why Mr Tiny Rowland is also anxious to portray Lonrho as a company whose
business is trading assets.
Lonrho's fascination with Hongkong Land's stake in Trafalgar House is also
instructive. That gave the Hong Kong group management control after paying
for a stake of only 25 per cent. There is an obvious parallel with Mr Bock's
small stake in Lonrho. Mr Rowland said yesterday that Lonrho had considered
applying the principle to a stake in Ladbroke when its shares were at their
nadir. In theory that might have been a cheap way for the new Lonrho to
spread its wings. But the Keswick family which is behind Hongkong Land has
the unstinting support of the Hongkong Bank group and a record in managing
public companies which Mr Bock cannot yet boast.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Leading Article: A pale green blockbuster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The environment, more even than other areas such as economics or defence,
requires a touch of the visionary to go with a robust framework for those
who have to make regulatory, policy or business decisions.
Yesterday's policy blockbuster from Mr John Major and his environment
secretary, Mr John Gummer, Taking Rio forward tries to fill this bill, and
in some respects succeeds. It identifies the goals to which Britain
committed itself at the 1992 Earth Summit and maps out routes towards them:
a better use of resources, more care for environmental assets such as clean
air and water, and respect for biological diversity.
It also stresses the need for a balanced approach which weighs the benefits
as well as the costs, something that many people prefer to ignore until
their clamour for a cleaner environment translates into higher taxes or a
wind farm in their back garden. In other words, environment is not merely a
question of government providing the right policy, but people adapting their
lifestyles and the way they think.
But having said all that, it is hard to see Taking Rio forward having more
than a marginal effect on either the way British people conduct their lives,
or the way government behaves. The document is notably devoid of new or
inspiring initiatives, and it lacks the force needed to convince the reader
that it will resolve the increasingly difficult contradictions between the
government's environmental aims and its policies in other areas.
Pragmatic approach
To some extent this is due to a desire to retain a pragmatic approach and
avoid the damage that an overzealous environmental policy can do to other
aspects of the national interest, such as industrial competitiveness. There
is no point, for example, in forcing all the country's coal-fired power
stations to install expensive clean-up equipment - as Germany has done -
when many of them will shut down or be replaced by natural gas within the
present policy time frame. Britain can live with this contradiction because
it is temporary - though the foreseen solution owes much to the accident of
Britain's natural energy endowments.
But the document is weak in key areas, notably transport, which it
acknowledges is likely to produce some of the most severe environmental
pressures in the years ahead. To hear Mr Major speak yesterday, the only
solution the government has to offer is a commitment to increase petrol tax
and to study road pricing. Such proposals look suspiciously like making a
virtue of budgetary necessity rather than taking a thorough view of the
problem.
Clear policy
Here is an area where market forces alone will not provide solutions, yet
where a clear policy framework could produce ideas to deal with both the
public's increasing exasperation with traffic congestion, and its professed
concern for the environment. Fiscal measures, regulation and investment,
especially in public transport, need to be blended in the right proportions
to achieve the desired result.
It is also premature of the government to claim sustainable policies for
areas like energy and forestry when crucial issues such as the future of
nuclear power and the privatisation of the Forestry Commission remain
unresolved. However, the prime minister's comment yesterday that the
forthcoming review of nuclear power should take a broad view of the issue
was welcome. Until now, ministers have spoken of the need for a narrow,
commercially focused review which would have ignored the environmental
benefits that nuclear has to offer as a non-gas-emitting power source.
As for the way forward, the government has appointed an advisory committee
to help its deliberations. Though eminent and highly qualified, its members
all belong to what might be called the green great and good: some are
already advising on other environmental bodies, and it must be wondered how
much freshness they will bring to the subject.
Mr Major is right to continue to give high personal priority to the
environmental agenda, on which Britain has a less than first-rate
reputation. The search for clarity and consistency, however, is not yet at
an end.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Observer: Bock's bark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Presented with the chance to quiz Dieter Bock at Lonrho's first investment
analysts meeting, what would you have asked the man who has been fighting
one of the most intriguing boardroom battles in recent corporate history?
Pedestrian and respectful questions about interest charges and dividend
cover were about all the obviously rather awestruck city scribblers managed
yesterday as they foregathered to hear the next stage of Bock's campaign to
turn Lonrho into a rather more orthodox company.
The organisers had been distinctly nervous about the whole affair and the
publicity-shy board's underwhelming performance at the rehearsal the
previous evening had brought to mind nothing more than a 'training session
by the Kuwaiti national football team' in the words of one observer.
But it all passed off without incident - and, of course, without Tiny
Rowland. 'It will be something to tell the grandchildren,' remarked one
participant, apparently without irony. Bock, meanwhile, delighted his new
audience with his increasingly acute impression of a German character
straight off the set of 'Allo 'Allo.

<TEXT>
Lloyd's has been going through difficult times - more than Pounds 5bn of
losses, to be precise - but does its future really lie in being an upmarket
site for cheeseburgers and rowing machines?
The insurance market which started life as a coffee shop has formed a
joint-venture with Pret a Manger, a chain of sandwich bars and cafes, and a
sports club could open in the basement.
Lloyd's let part of the floor space at its former HQ on Lime Street to Pret
a Manger, receiving a percentage of the bar's turnover. Stephen Hall,
Lloyd's finance director, says 'the name of the game is reducing costs and
jacking up revenue'. Nick Phillips, Lloyd's property manager, wants to do a
deal with a leisure company to open a sports club in the basement.
The returns will not be massive; security considerations mean that only
employees of the corporation or of the agents and brokers may use either
facility. Now that could be a really a exclusive club.

At last a political breakthrough for the followers of the Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, founder and leading exponent of the business of transcendental
meditation. Having failed with another great transcendental philosophy -
marxism - Joaquim Chissano, Mozambique's president, has taken up the Yogi's
ideas.
While Chissano chants, some of his cabinet are busily engaged in less
ascetic practices, such as making lots of money from the rebuilding of
Mozambique's war-torn economy. Maputo-based businessmen, long-accustomed to
necessary kickbacks, complain that government officials facing early
retirement now have insatiable appetites.
But the prospect of Chissano's Frelimo party - in power since 1975 - failing
in Mozambique's first elections next October does not cheer spirits either.
The rebel group Renamo - once described as Africa's answer to the Khmer
Rouge - is busily acquiring the trappings of a conventional political party.
It has opened a sumptuous HQ in Maputo and spent Dollars 100,000 of UN money
on furnishings.

Never let it be said that a spell in Brussels is an obstacle to advancement
in Whitehall. Downing Street's announcement that Paul Lever is to take over
from Pauline Neville-Jones as the chairman of the joint intelligence
committee completes the latest game of Whitehall musical chairs.
Neville-Jones takes over as the FCO's political director.
What the No 10 press release didn't say was that both Lever and
Neville-Jones made their names in the early 1980s as, respectively, chef and
deputy chef in the cabinet of the then British commissioner in Brussels,
Christopher Tugendhat.

What's Hanson up to in Australia? Having toyed with the idea of selling its
40 per cent stake in Renison Goldfields, which it inherited with its 1989
takeover of Consolidated Gold Fields, it seems to have decided to try to
make a go of it. Tony Cotton, 50, one of Lord Hanson's ablest lieutenants,
has been sent down under to take over as chairman.
It's an unusual move for a company that has 98 per cent of its capital tied
up in North America and the UK. Hanson has never shown much interest in the
Pacific basin and Renison is a bit of a tiddler in the world mining
industry. If Derek Bonham, Hanson's relatively new chief executive, wants to
prove that Hanson's world extends beyond the North Atlantic, Renison will
need beefing up substantially.
Rival BTR has already shown what can be done down under. Who knows, Tony
Cotton could be Hanson's answer to BTR chief executive Alan Jackson, who
made his name at BTR Nylex.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Why the Fed should tighten
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To raise or not to raise, that is the question. But Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues at the Federal Reserve should not, like Hamlet, take too long to
make up their minds. If, as has happened so often before, monetary policy
were to be tightened too slowly as well as too late, both the credibility of
the Federal Reserve and the medium-term performance of the economy might be
endangered.
Between the end of 1990 and July 1992, Mr Greenspan's Federal Reserve cut
the discount rate seven times, from 7 to 3 per cent. But the economy had
already fallen into recession in the third quarter of 1990. With the benefit
of hindsight at least, those cuts were both too late and too slow when they
came. That was an unfortunate error, particularly, as it turned out, for
former president George Bush.
Avoiding the same mistake in the opposite direction is still more important.
Cutting rates too slowly does at least reinforce price stability and central
bank credibility. Raising too slowly, particularly under strong political
pressure from the administration and congress, would threaten the reverse.
At worst, the valuable achievement of a low inflation base for long-term
expansion could be put in peril.
With the US economy now nearing the third anniversary of the end of
recession, watchers of the Federal Reserve are becoming increasingly
nervous. Short-term interest rates, unchanged for one-and-a-half years, and
not raised for almost five, are also unusually low for this stage of a
recovery. They are bound to rise. The question is when and by how much. The
answer must be derived from examination of the state both of the economy and
of domestic politics.
Full capacity
An expected annualised rise of over five per cent in gross domestic product
in the final quarter of 1993 suggests that excess capacity is rapidly
diminishing. A slow down in the first few months of this year is inevitable.
But full capacity is already quite close. Unemployment at 6.4 per cent, for
example, is not far short of the point at which wage inflation would
normally be expected to take off. Add to this the high prices of financial
assets, notably equities, and the 11.6 per cent expansion of narrow money
(M1) in 1993 and overheating, rather than a faltering recovery, looks the
more immediate danger.
Markets agree with this assessment. The upward slope of the yield curve
indicates that investors expect short rates to rise above 3 1/2 per cent
during 1994. Over the past year-and-a-half of discount rate stability, the
Federal Reserve disappointed similar market expectations, but its relative
optimism about future inflation also proved well founded. It would be risky,
however, for the Federal Reserve to remain persistently more optimistic than
the markets on the future course of inflation. If it were to get one of
these bets wrong, interest rates might have to be raised substantially to
tame inflation. This would be at considerable cost to the economy in terms
of lost output and jobs. Worse, the painfully regained credibility under
Paul Volcker and Mr Greenspan might be damaged.
Difficult decision
Here is where politics enter. The Federal Reserve is being told not to raise
rates from many quarters, not least Mr Clinton's. Prudence suggests
acquiescence. But a central bank judged to be the politicians' poodle will
have to inflict more damage to the economy than if its credibility is
unquestioned. The difficult decision is the one to raise rates before
everyone agrees it is necessary. By then it will be too late. Since timely
rate increases are always unpopular, Mr Greenspan should tell politicians
they have an interest in keeping an independent Federal Reserve as their
whipping boy.
Naturally, Mr Greenspan will wish to avoid tightening either too soon or too
much. It will be another few months before it is evident how much the rate
of growth has fallen since the last quarter. But the Fed must remember that
there tends to be a trade-off between early jumps in interest rates and big
ones, while certainty always comes too late. It should, in short, be looking
to make a small increase in the discount rate soon. A modest firming of
interest rates is warranted by the fundamentals and would inject welcome
credibility into US monetary policy.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Personal View: Cuba's switch from state economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JORGE I DOMINGUEZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early 1990s, half of Cuba's formal economy disappeared, according to
the Cuban government's own statistics. Export earnings fell by about 60 per
cent between 1989 and 1992, while imports fell by about 70 per cent in the
same period. When in the spring of 1993 Cuba's sugar harvest output fell by
a third compared to the 1992 level, President Fidel Castro knew he had to
authorise significant economic changes if he was to reactivate the economy
and save his regime.
Since the summer of 1993, a series of economic reforms has been promulgated.
Their effects are still difficult to gauge, but their design and preliminary
results shed light on Cuba's near-term prospects.
On July 26, Castro announced his decision to legalise the holding of dollars
and other foreign currencies by ordinary Cubans, and their use in retail
trade. The aim was to stimulate dollar remittances from Cuban-Americans to
friends and relatives in Cuba. Foreign currencies may not be used, though,
to pay wages or to stimulate domestic output directly. Under those
limitations, the short-term economic and political effects have been
problematic for the government.
Who had dollars? The answer is those who had obtained them illegally; those
who had been perhaps less politically loyal and had retained contacts with
their relatives in the US; and those who had enjoyed the privilege of going
overseas with Cuban government authorisation.
Opening up the use of foreign currencies for purposes other than stimulation
of production led to a rush on existing dollar retail stores established to
serve tourists and diplomats. To curtail demand in these stores, the
government decreed a 50 per cent price increase. The partial currency
liberalisation also provided a strong incentive to ordinary Cubans to move
out of the formal peso-denominated economy into the illegal economy or into
the foreign currency segments of the formal economy. In effect, the
government's decision expanded the money supply without increasing output.
This created economic and political distress.
In August, the government allowed individuals in more than 100 occupations
to go into business for themselves (a modification in October excluded
medical doctors and teachers). Until then, the only lawful way to contract a
plumber or to get a hair-cut was to go to the state enterprise in charge of
providing such services. The effects of freeing the market are modest,
however, because most services had been freely, though illegally, available.
The potential dynamism this measure could impart to the economy is also
limited: no one is authorised to hire non-relatives.
In September, the partial privatisation of state farms was authorised.
Agricultural workers on state farms can now form private co-operatives.
There are, though, three limitations. No one but the state can have property
title to the land. No one can work by himself or herself; workers must join
co-operatives. Moreover, all commercial output must still be sold to the
ministry of agriculture.
Because of these limitations, the economic results of the measures are
modest and are likely to remain so unless additional steps are taken. Some
are already in the pipeline. The central bank is considering changing the
rigid exchange rate policy, a move which, with the decision to permit
circulation of foreign currencies for retail trade, might enable Cuba to
qualify to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank some time in 1994.
These modest economic reforms have more far-reaching political implications.
Above all, the Cuban government has admitted through these decisions that it
can no longer govern much of the economy. The weakness of the Cuban state
was especially evident in the decree authorising the free contracting of
certain services. It says progressive taxation would be the best way to
regulate and tax such activities, but then admits the government is
incapable of administering such a system. Instead of tax payments relative
to the volume of economic activity or to earnings, self-employed persons are
to pay a monthly flat fee.
Today Cuba has three co-existing economies. One is illegal. Another is legal
and operates only in hard-currency. The third is the rapidly shrinking
official economy, which operates in pesos through state enterprises. Most of
Cuba's commercial transactions now occur in the first two private economies.
The Cuban economy's transition from socialism is well under way.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Squabble may spoil life's ambition: Alison Smith examines a
long-running regulatory challenge confronting the UK financial services
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I want high standards objectively delivered . . . I want genuine
self-regulation . . . I want people to put mistakes right with their own
money . . . I want an independent committee of inquiry to look at investor
protection.'
It is an advertisement that the Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance
group, has not yet written. But, in the style of the group's current
campaign, it would capture the - sometimes conflicting - aspirations of the
main players in the British life industry for their future regulatory
framework.
Not everyone is going to be satisfied. The board of the Personal Investment
Authority - the embryonic self-regulatory organisation which many in the
industry hope will overcome fears about the way life products are sold -
meets today. It will discuss its application for recognition by the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
On one side the board faces pressure from the SIB to restore public
confidence in an industry hit by concern over, for example, the sale of
personal pension schemes.
On the other side, there are many in the industry who fear that the SIB's
demands will prolong uncertainty over how the financial services sector is
regulated. Since the 1986 financial services act introduced the system of
self-regulation within a statutory framework, there has been an unsettling
series of changes.
What role the PIA should carve for itself has been a matter of debate since
early 1992. Then moves began to replace the widely criticised system under
which regulation of retail financial services is split mainly between Lautro
and Fimbra, responsible for life companies and independent financial
advisers respectively.
There still is no consensus among practitioners about the best way forward:
as the arguments have raged some, including Mr Mick Newmarch, the
Prudential's chief executive, have said that the best course is to move to a
full-blown statutory system.
Now the debate may be coming to a head. The PIA, led by Mr Joe Palmer, a
former chief executive of insurance group Legal &amp; General who became PIA
chairman late last year, is close to finalising draft proposals to present
to the SIB and to the industry in the coming weeks. If the PIA's plan fails
to win enough support, the case for the government introducing statutory
regulation will be strengthened.
All the indications are that the PIA's plans fit closely the specifications
of the SIB. Last January its chairman, Mr Andrew Large, told the PIA he
wanted 'a step change in standards and practices'. That, he said, must
include having only a minority of industry representatives on the PIA board,
tougher criteria for admitting companies or individuals into the industry,
and an effective system for monitoring compliance with PIA rules.
Assuming the PIA board agrees the main points of its application for
recognition today, the SIB should announce soon that it is 'minded to
recognise' the PIA as a regulator.
The next stage will be for the PIA to publish its prospectus and, if it is
to become operational, persuade a majority of the life industry to accept
it. The PIA hopes to be open for business this summer. But the signs are
that the industry is not likely to offer unconditional support for the
prospectus: the shadow boxing of recent months will turn into a test of
nerves.
Four main issues are at stake:
Most contentious is the composition of the PIA board. The PIA wants nine of
its 19 members to be practitioners, and the other 10, including the chairman
and the chief executive, to be 'public interest' directors who do not work
in the industry.
This has met stiff opposition. Mr Michael Doerr, chief executive of Friends
Provident, the mutually owned life and pensions group, says self-regulation
should mean just that: 'I'm looking for a change of mind on board
membership.'
In an attempt at conciliation, Mr Palmer, PIA chairman, has said public
interest directors could include people who had previously worked in the
industry. But Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life,
who resigned from the PIA board earlier this month in opposition to its
plans, says: 'This would be the worst of all possible worlds.'
He believes that Mr Palmer's proposals would fall short of genuine
self-regulation, while still not convincing the public that non-practitioner
board members were acting in the public interest.
Admission procedures are also sensitive for the PIA. Almost all the
organisations and individuals who will apply to come under the PIA's
umbrella will have been accepted by existing regulators. To exclude
significant numbers would anger the industry, but if the PIA excludes
nobody, it would be harder to show that the regulatory regime was tougher.
'An opportunity would be lost if PIA membership was not seen as something
you have to aspire to,' says Mr Arthur Selman, senior executive responsible
for financial services at Halifax building society.
The most likely outcome is that some companies and individuals will be
excluded - but the admissions procedure will not be the last word and the
PIA will rely on continued monitoring to weed out the fraudulent and
incompetent.
Financing the PIA.
The industry is reluctant to bear significantly higher costs for regulation.
But the PIA appears to have pitched its budgeting sensitively, envisaging
first-year running costs of about Pounds 30m - only slightly higher than the
combined running costs of the existing regime. Arrangements for
compensation. Here the picture is less clear-cut, since the PIA's plans
depend on the outcome of a separate consultation exercise by the SIB on
proposed changes to the investors' compensation scheme, which covers all
financial services and ensures that badly advised customers can be
compensated even if the company involved cannot make payments.
'Mistakes will happen - we want to be sure that when they do the people who
make them put them right with their own money,' says Mr Chris Sharp, chief
executive of Northern Rock building society and a PIA board member.
On all four issues, the options for life insurance companies which do not
wish to accept the PIA's prospectus are limited. The regulators have the
upper hand: the SIB could increase the pressure to join the PIA by
withdrawing recognition of Lautro and Fimbra.
One alternative is for life companies and advisers to opt to be regulated
directly by the SIB in an effort to undermine the PIA. The disarray this
would cause could, if enough exercised this right, trigger early moves to
statutory regulation of financial services. That may please some in the life
industry - but would be the opposite of what most practitioners, who support
self-regulation, would want.
So the only realistic option for disgruntled life insurers is to ensure
there are enough voices opposing the PIA's plans to stop the organisation
from gaining credibility. In the brinkmanship likely in the next few months,
the widespread desire for stable regulatory arrangements could prove
decisive. Few leading figures in the industry have an appetite for
confrontation with the SIB. Mr Newmarch of the Prudential has not ruled out
the Prudential joining the PIA. Similarly, Mr Stretton of Standard Life says
his company 'is not in the business of just making gestures'.
Nevertheless, the concern in the financial services industry over the PIA's
proposals are real. There are few who are prepared to offer unqualified
support for the new body. If its long-term future is to be assured - and a
statutory regime avoided - it will need to prove that it can win the
goodwill of the industry and deliver high standards for investors. The
ructions surrounding its establishment have not been auspicious.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No problem with UK aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN BONDERUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On December 14 you printed a letter from Dr Michael Cross who, after
three years' research, concluded that the UK 'has a long way to go if the UK
manufacturing base is to become world class'. His study could not have
focused on the UK's aerospace industry, about which we at Lockheed hold a
different view.
You might like to know that Lockheed is undertaking a major commercial
venture to modernise the C-130 Hercules aircraft and we have conducted a
worldwide competition to identify suppliers: 1) with the most modern
technologies; 2) meeting or exceeding established quality standards; 3)
capable of meeting stringent delivery schedules; 4) offering the best
prices; and 5) willing to invest their own money in the programme.
As of today, 18 UK companies have won positions on the Hercules team - far
more than any other nation outside the US, representing exports for the UK
economy which over the next 10 years alone will amount to well above Pounds
1.2bn. Moreover, we should be quite clear that their contribution in terms
of technological expertise and competitiveness has been a significant factor
in ensuring we are able to offer a more affordable, reliable and capable
aircraft than any prior model in the 40-year history of the Lockheed
Hercules aircraft line.
I appreciate the point Dr Cross was trying to make with regard to the
overall UK manufacturing picture. However, from our perspective, and based
not on academic analysis but on hard commercial experience, UK aerospace
companies with which we are now partners hold verifiable world-class
credentials.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'A clear case of confusion' (January 22/23) spoke of
conflicting recovery signals. Evidence from the (industrial) cliff face is
that order books are building up slowly and steadily - which is just what is
wanted. Hence the cautious, but sustained, rise in gross national product,
evident now for more than a year.
Retail sales are another matter. It is probably desirable they should not
move ahead too fast, to avoid sucking in imports on what might be termed
'froth' spending. There need be no conflict here. The underlying heartbeat
of the build-up of the economy appears sound.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Least bad option: There is no end in sight to the turmoil in
western policy on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may be perplexed by western policy on the war in Bosnia, and no wonder.
Fortunately, I can describe it in one word: turmoil. I have it on impeccable
authority in Whitehall: 'We are all in turmoil.'
They are in turmoil because the Geneva peace negotiations have collapsed,
which seems to imply a fight to the finish by the warring parties and a
death blow to the peace process offered by the west. And if the peace
process really is dead, the west will have to make a fundamental
re-appraisal of policy. That is why there is turmoil: governments are
casting around for something else to do, and so far they have found nothing.
There are at least three symptoms of disarray. First, there is the stress
affecting UN forces on the ground: one Belgian general has withdrawn
exhausted and one French general has been sacked for criticising the UN
leadership.
Partly as a result, we have heard sporadic noises in London and Paris,
mainly from the defence ministries, that the two governments may decide to
bring their troops home. Why expose their soldiers to the dangers of
'peacekeeping' if the three communities in Bosnia refuse to make peace?
Third, and quite contradictorily, the French government is calling for a
more forceful western strategy to impose peace on the ground, which would
include US military involvement. The US has immediately stamped on the idea:
it will not get involved in the war in Bosnia. The French say they will soon
put forward a new Bosnia plan anyway.
It is hard to imagine what the French can come up with. But neither Britain
nor France is likely to withdraw its troops unilaterally. A top French
official tells me: 'There is simply no question of just pulling out French
troops like that.' A unilateral withdrawal of British troops looks equally
unlikely; if there is a change in UK policy, it will be co-ordinated with
other western countries.
In fact, western governments, starting with Britain and France, may yet
conclude that their least bad option is to stick with their present Bosnia
policy. It is deeply unsatisfactory from many points of view: peacekeeping
is not bringing peace; the humanitarian aid operation is being largely
frustrated; and the magic circle comprising the UN, the United Nations
Protection Force (Unprofor) and Nato is riddled with double-speak and
ambivalence.
But the present policy is what western governments were left with after they
found all the other options looked worse. When Whitehall completes its
current review, it may come to the same conclusion as before: the fact that
the war situation has got worse does not mean that new and better peace
options have suddenly become available.
One argument which may slow down the impetus for the withdrawal of troops is
that it could precipitate other actions which could be more dangerous than
anything we now face. At one time, for example, the Americans advocated an
actively pro-Moslem policy, on the grounds that the Moslems were the victims
in an unequal war and deserved a helping hand. They encapsulated their
proposal in the catchy little slogan 'lift-and-strike': lift the arms
embargo on the Moslems and bomb the Serbs.
The US proposal was resisted by Britain and France, partly on the grounds
that air strikes would be totally incompatible with UN peacekeeping and
humanitarian aid, and would force them to withdraw their troops. But if
Britain and France were to withdraw their troops quite independently, then
that part of the argument against 'lift-and-strike' would disappear.
In fact, there are other, stronger arguments against 'lift-and-strike' -
tactical, strategic and political. It is easy to empathise with moral
indignation at the barbarity of the Serbs' war of conquest and genocide. But
indignation provides no confidence that a partial, indirect, arm's-length
intervention by the west on behalf of the Moslems would make us feel better,
let alone produce a more satisfactory result on the ground.
Let us suppose that such an indirect intervention were to help the Moslem
side in the war. Do we think we could nicely calculate, in advance or
afterwards, just how much help they should have, or prescribe just how much
land they should recapture in the name of justice? Or do we just want a
fairer war? This new policy could not be expressed in a UN resolution, as
the Russians would veto it. So would it merely be executed by a posse of
enthusiastic governments, regardless of the protests of other states?
The only certain result of the west helping to arm the Moslems is that
Russia and other Slav states would step up their help to the Serbs. The war
in Bosnia would then become a much bigger war; and not merely would we have
no guarantee that the Moslems would come off better, we would find ourselves
embroiled in an open proxy war against the Russians.
According to the conventional wisdom, ethnic war on the Yugoslav pattern is
likely to be the main threat to peace and stability in Europe in the years
ahead. The conventional wisdom is surely wrong. If there were to be a
serious threat to western Europe, it would most likely come from Russian
attempts to recapture their former empire in eastern Europe; Russian
nationalists are already talking threateningly about the Baltic countries.
The west has refused to intervene directly in Yugoslavia in terms that might
conceivably have curbed the war. It could now respond to the breakdown in
Geneva simply by withdrawing all UN troops. That would be brutal and
heartless, but rational. But if we were now deliberately to pursue a policy
designed to maximise the scale of the war as well as the risks of open
conflict with Russia, without any compensating advantage, we should be
guilty of harebrained folly.

   From Mr RICHARD BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There has been speculation over the perceived discrepancy between the
recent British Chambers of Commerce and Confederation of British Industry
surveys ('CBI survey affirms steady economic recovery', January 25). When
comparing like with like there is little difference between the two. As the
chancellor noted, the BCC survey shows the recovery remains on track, and
that in manufacturing there has been an improved performance, particularly
in terms of exports and confidence.
Chambers' concerns lie with the slowdown in the rate of growth in the
service sector, including small firms - the engine room of the economy - an
area not as widely covered by the CBI. It is understandable that our
different constituencies provide a different perspective on the state of the
economy. Each has its value to business and policymakers.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Riddle of the three Guys: Belgium's French-speaking
Socialists face allegations of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ancient palais de justice in Liege stands on the brink of a vast hole,
excavated years ago as part of a plan to renovate the Belgian city's central
square. But while the city authorities argue about what to do with the hole,
Mrs Veronique Ancia, one of the palais' investigating magistrates, is
opening up a second pit with an inquiry which threatens to undermine one of
the partners in Belgium's fragile coalition government.
Mrs Ancia is digging into allegations of bribery and corruption in Belgium's
French-speaking Socialist party, the PS. Liege, in the francophone region of
Wallonia, is getting used to such probes: in 1992, for example, the city's
image was tarnished when the then mayor of the Socialist stronghold was
given a 28-month suspended prison sentence for accepting bribes to award
parking meter and property contracts to certain companies.
But what sets Mrs Ancia's inquiry apart from more humdrum allegations of
Belgian political corruption is the fact that it was triggered by a murder,
and that it could destabilise the country's fragile four-party government,
made up of Christian Democrats and Socialists from both sides of Belgium's
French-Dutch language divide.
On Friday, her inquiry claimed its first ministerial victims. Mr Guy Coeme
quit as Belgium's deputy prime minister, quickly followed by Mr Guy
Spitaels, respected head of the regional government of Wallonia, and Mr Guy
Mathot, Wallonia's interior minister.
Mrs Ancia wants to interview the trio - inevitably dubbed 'the three Guys' -
about claims that bribes were promised to the PS in return for awarding a
BFr8bn helicopter contract to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer, in
1988. The Belgian parliament has already agreed to the partial lifting of Mr
Spitaels' and Mr Mathot's immunity from prosecution. Mr Coeme yesterday
asked a separate parliamentary committee to clear the way for him to defend
his position in the Belgian supreme court.
All three deny any wrongdoing. Agusta itself is due to hold a press
conference on the affair next week, and is expected to repeat its denials
that it has been connected with illegal financial dealings.
So is the Agusta affair just an easily contained internal ruction affecting
one coalition partner, or a potential earthquake that could bring down the
government?
What is certain is that extensive leaks of Mrs Ancia's report to parliament
have provoked a rare passion in the Belgian media and exposed divisions in
the PS which will be difficult to patch over. De Standaard, the heavyweight
Flemish daily, summed up the crisis on Monday with a cartoon of a crumbling
PS headquarters with a large, helicopter-shaped hole punched in one
supporting wall.
Leading francophone Socialists admit that the main reason the affair is
provoking such fervour is that Mrs Ancia's inquiry into the Agusta affair
was triggered by her parallel investigation into the 1991 murder of Mr Andre
Cools, former PS leader and prominent Liege Socialist. He was gunned down in
a Liege street as he left his mistress's apartment. But although rumour is
rife, nobody has yet proved a connection between the Agusta bribery
allegations and the killing.
However, a deep desire to seek a solution to the Cools assassination has
prompted some prominent members of the PS and friends of the dead man to
testify against their colleagues in the Agusta affair. As Mr Philippe
Busquin, leader of the PS, said at the weekend: 'The basis of the problem
(in the PS) is that behind all this there is a death - and not just
anybody's death - the death of a former PS president. We have to know who
was behind the assassination of Andre Cools, and the mixing of this problem
. . . with other problems has created an emotive and passionate atmosphere
which is quite understandable.'
Such emotion is not calculated to assist Belgium's coalition government,
which has spent most of its 22-month life tiptoeing along the edge of
crisis. So far, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the tenacious Flemish Christian
Democrat prime minister, has managed to sidestep other pitfalls. Partly that
is because the government parties are afraid that opposition parties -
particularly the right-of-centre liberals - might bounce them out of office
in an early general election. Mr Dehaene has also profited from that fear,
which has enabled him to push through difficult measures such as
constitutional reform and budget cuts.
However, before Friday's clutch of resignations, the coalition was beginning
to look queasy. In particular, the opposition was pressing home its
criticism of the government, which is still trying to implement unpopular
austerity measures and cut the country's budget deficit.
Then last Wednesday, MPs from the Flemish coalition parties prevented Mr
Dehaene from blocking three opposition parliamentary motions calling for the
resignation of Mr Coeme. It was a clear signal that the deputy prime
minister, and his colleagues in the regional government, would have to go,
or risk opening up the old Flemish-Walloon political divide which has
brought down previous coalitions.
According to observers, the ministers' departure came just at the right
moment, as international investors in Belgian bonds and currency began to
question the government's chances of survival. Mr Peter Praet, economist at
Generale de Banque, Belgium's biggest bank, says that even after weeks
proclaiming their innocence, the trio finally realised they had a 'political
responsibility' to resign.
The decision appears temporarily to have defused the political tension. At
the weekend, the coalition parties reaffirmed their commitment to continue
in government, in spite of the large-scale national and regional ministerial
reshuffle provoked by the turmoil within the PS. The standard PS line on the
affair has also become clear: from the grassroots upwards, francophone
Socialist officials are echoing their president's call for 'clarity and
respect for the judicial procedure'. Apart from that, it is business as
usual.
However, with European elections due in June and local ones in October, the
opposition is not going to let the matter drop. The Flemish liberals, in
particular, want to push through plans for a 'clean hands' bill which would,
they say, curb corruption, clean up party financing and underpin the
independence of public servants, who are said to be depend too much on
political patronage.
Plans for legislation were already laid, say the liberals, before the
political row over Agusta, but several government politicians have accused
them of profiting from the occasion, in particular by organising a
fact-finding trip to Italy last week for two deputies to examine the
country's anti-corruption measures.
Critics of the mission believe parallels between Italian and Belgian
corruption scandals have been exaggerated. But Mr Hugo Coveliers, one of the
MPs on last week's trip, claims there are similarities. 'The problem is, if
you have a weak authority, a weak administration, then groups like the Mafia
and others are going to try and capture it: I think in some parts of this
country that has been done,' he says.
All sides agree on one point, that Mrs Ancia is the only person who has a
chance of shedding light on what really lay behind the award of the Agusta
contract and the murder of Mr Andre Cools. And although she has herself been
accused of political motivation (she is a Christian Democrat) and the leaked
details of her dossier have been criticised for their lack of substance, she
alone has the tenacity to pursue the inquiry until the Agusta and Cools
affairs are finally solved.
Until she completes that task, the PS and, by extension, the government will
have to face up to more buffeting from the opposition over the Agusta
affair. But it seems unlikely that any of the government parties will want
to force an election. As the prime minister pointed out in a radio interview
on Monday, no Belgian party has ever gained by quitting a coalition
prematurely.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pressures different in a small
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEPHEN CASTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Grant-Wilson (Letters, January 22), commenting on Peter Bonfield's
Personal View (January 19), is, I think, a little out with his statement
that 'very few successful chief executives in business operate with more
than 10 direct reports'. The vast bulk of senior executives in business are,
of course, running small businesses, not uncommonly large ones like Mr
Bonfield's Fujitsu subsidiary, ICL. The great majority of these are
owner-proprietors, sole traders or lone directors of their own limited
companies.
With varying degrees of equanimity, such senior executives operate with many
more than 10 'direct reports': sales prospect contacts, customers, bank
managers, VAT inspectors, trading standards officers, solicitors,
accountants, direct employees, subcontractors, taxmen, customer accounts
departments (chasing payments in), creditors (postponing payments out),
suppliers (chasing delivery), advertising, office equipment/supplies,
computer and telecoms salesmen, 'red tape' government departments,
journalists, etc. I estimate this to be at least 60 different 'directs'
to/from whom the small business executive must 'report' in any week.
If the FT were to run more 'If I were a government minister . . .' Personal
Views, it might be a good idea to ask those running small businesses to
contribute, rather than relatively unrepresentative, and unpressurised,
big-company senior executives. The paucity of the latter's 'direct reports'
must make the average business director/proprietor wonder what they do all
day.
Then again, the small businessman's spouse would doubtless be even more
amazed. Any housewife - sorry, house-spouse - must surely have to consider,
decide on and operate with more 'direct reports' in any normal weekday
morning than the prime minister or any (large or small) business executive
copes with in a week. Come to think of it, weren't the management techniques
of those responsible for housekeeping the basis for the brand of 'UK Ltd'
management promoted by Baroness T? Stephen Castell,

FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conglomerates have their place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DAVID J COLLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A view from this side of the Atlantic on the validity of conglomeration
as a viable corporate strategy ('Diversify and die', January 4). The fact is
that the most successful US corporations in the 1980s were conglomerates. It
was just that they were not called conglomerates - they were called
'leveraged buy-out' (LBO) partnerships. Consider KKR: from nothing, to more
than Dollars 40bn in revenues and nearly 400,000 employees in 20 years, with
returns to investors of up to 50 per cent a year. Not a bad performance.
The truth is there is no one right sort of corporate strategy. Conglomerates
are neither universally good nor bad. A good corporate strategy is one that
leverages a unique set of resources - physical assets or intangible assets
such as brand name or consumer marketing skills - into those businesses
where they contribute to competitive advantage. The valuable resource
conglomerates possess is usually a tight financial control system. This can
create value for market-leading companies in mature, low-technology
industries by creating managerial incentives for efficiency. Conglomeration
is, and will continue to be, a viable corporate strategy in a limited set of
industries, and for businesses with a particular market position.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Arts: Heavyweight 'Moose' - Mime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I love mime
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but when a lot of my friends say 'I hate mime,' I reply 'I know what you
mean.' To them, 'mime' means butch and bright-eyed eager beavers, with a
mental age of about 14, hamming away like crazy, nudging the audience to
understand the gist of their every point, making every point not once but
repeatedly, and labouring to 'say' things in movement that could be said far
quicker in words. Alas, The Right Size, a group of three men, fits right
bang into that category in its current show, Moose.
This production tells the farcical-tragico-sentimental-comic tale of two
ballooning brothers who manage to maroon themselves in the wintriest areas
of the Arctic. The sweetest thing about the show is in fact the story it
tells - a story that also involves an Anglophone loner into whose one-room
hut these brothers arrive; the ludicrous efforts they make to communicate
with him until they realise that he speaks their language anyway; the stupid
games they play with him (over a dreadfully meagre meal and a stupendously
lethal drink); the barriers he puts up to keep them out of his inner life;
and his real need for company.
All of which is often touching, and could have made a vintage silent movie.
The best joke is a repeated joke about mime: whenever these guys try sign
language, they misunderstand each other totally.
What stops Moose from becoming wonderful, or even good, is the heavyweight
cuteness with which it is performed. As so often with (second-rate) mime,
the performers do too little to make their onstage world real, and keep on
selling everything oh] so keenly to their audience.
The quota of violence is high, the degree of virtuoso physical skill
moderate, the quota of revealing human detail low, the quota of coherent
subtlety nearly non-existent. The story, I repeat, is endearing. Yet anyone
can imagine how some of the great actor-clowns of the silent-movie era could
have turned Moose into a work of art, whereas here it is merely a
heavy-handed romp.
The Right Size performs Moose at the Purcell Room tonight. The London Mime
Festival continues, in various venues, until Monday January 31

FT  26 JAN 94 / Arts: Carmen steals the show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denyce Graves was ill for Friday's Royal Opera Carmen revival writes Max
Loppert. This was a big disappointment: since the charms of the young
American mezzo-soprano and the special qualities of her gypsy heroine had
already been loudly hymned in several of the world's main operatic cities,
her London debut was eagerly awaited. In her absence, the house flew in an
opening-night replacement with fine qualities of her own; for her appearance
alone the occasion proved not a waste of time.
Magali Damonte, Marseilles-born, also new to London, is only the second
francophone performer of Carmen in the postwar history of Covent Garden (the
first, Lyne Dourian, also 'jumped in' as a substitute, on a single evening
during the 1966-67 season). In this opera the shock of hearing sung and
spoken words delivered with clarity and bite, and with the teasing,
throwaway inflections that only French singers seem to have, is always a
savoury one. Miss Damonte's stock of these brought happy rewards in the
tavern scene, and the daring flatness of her final rejections of Jose added
perceptibly to their shock-content.
But there is more to this highly attractive artist than native accent. The
figure is slim, the manner agile, the voice not large but warm, fresh and
quick-speaking, with a dusky texture in mid-range that lent a personal tang
to many of Bizet's key phrases. Nervousness was perceptible, and excusable,
in most of Act 1; thereafter, although the rampant banality of the 1991
Nuria Espert production proves no stimulus to any sort of inventiveness, its
very mediocrity meant that few surprises were sprung on a late arrival like
Miss Damonte.
Certainly she has earned herself a return invitation. The other main
principals are capable, although the dead hand of the production team tells
more obviously in their vocal and physical actions: Neil Shicoff a serious,
passionate Jose too frequently reliant on all-out forcefulness, Barseg
Tumanyan an energetic, unstylish Escamillo, Leontina Vaduva an appealing but
too tremulous Micaela.
To add to the built-in handicaps of this hopeless, irredeemable Carmen
staging, the revival has thrown up a new one: that of conductor. Of all the
operas Jeffrey Tate has led at Covent Garden so far, Carmen - an opera which
thrives on Gallic lightness, snappiness and zest of handling - is surely the
one to which his musical gifts are least aptly suited.
By Monday night the promised Carmen had arrived, writes Richard Fairman.
Reading the gypsy's cards had presumably warned her that she would face a
different Don Jose from her stand-in and that the two of them would have to
inject any life that there was to be in the performance.
As much of Europe and the US have already discovered, Denyce Graves is a
natural as Carmen. Quietly brooding, tempting, she plays the role with a
kittenish touch, teasing the soldiers and giving Don Jose a surprise by
springing upon him from behind. Her dark mezzo flashes various colours,
including a warning red in the chest register when her temper is roused. As
she looks and sounds a Carmen, she judges rightly that she has no need to
work overtime to put the character across.
Her Jose, the tenor Richard Margison, is not so lucky: he is physically on
the stiff side and his voice, so clean and bright in Italian opera, sounds
too little sensuous and flexible in French. He does work hard, especially at
getting sensitivity into his singing, and all his intentions are going in
the right direction, even if the last ounce of passion is missing. Their
final scene together belongs to Graves, who underplays to a daring degree,
always still, calm, the emotion held within. Her Carmen somehow belongs in a
different kind of production.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Arts: Perils of the presentation game - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look for trends in television current affairs programmes early in 1994 and
only one thing is really clear: numbers are going up. Much the same is true
of all other programme categories, but current affairs may be the best place
to identify other developments also occurring to a greater or lesser extent
throughout the medium, but more easily detectable here than elsewhere. In
style and presentation there are two trends, and they seem to be moving in
opposite directions.
Of course in the centre there is still plenty of conventionally constructed
work. In last week's Assignment on BBC2 Brian Barron in Hong Kong,
investigating the approach to Britain's surrender of the territory in 1997,
provided the sort of exhaustive report which the better current affairs
series have always made. There cannot have been anybody of consequence that
Barron did not interview. Three weeks ago, also on BBC2, there was an
exemplary, structurally familiar, and highly enjoyable profile of the
journalist and politician Bill Deedes in Dear Bill.
In last week's Undercover Britain series on Channel 4 Graham Hall
contributed a report on the torture and killing of badgers which was enough
to fill the most timid viewer with a lust for vengeance against the sadists
who make their dogs drag out badgers by the nose from their underground
setts. However, while the programme was vivid, deeply upsetting, and shot by
one man using hidden camera equipment, it was put together in a familiar
enough way. There was some reference to Hall's exploits, as there had to be,
but he was not promoted as the programme's chief focus of interest, not even
as much as Roger Cook is in his investigative programmes. We were kept
informed by a perfectly ordinary script delivered in voice-over.
However, increasing numbers of programmes do not conform to the old
conventions. On the one hand, there are those which merely shovel material
into the viewer's lap, abandoning the use not only of a presenter but even
of a voice-over. On the whole such programmes are clearly not expected to be
big ratings winners. On the other hand there are more and more soft,
user-friendly programmes which obviously are meant to attract big audiences
and in which a 'personality' presenter is a vital part of the attraction,
sometimes the most important part, as with BBC1's Thursday night series
Jonathan Ross Presents and possibly even Michael Winner's True Crimes on
ITV. A particularly striking instance is The Bigger Picture on BBC2 in which
the presenter, comedian Billy Connolly, proves considerably more interesting
than the subject matter - Scottish art.
Channel 4's archaeology series, Time Team, looked at first as though it
might be another example since the presenter, for no clear reason, is Tony
Robinson, best known as Baldrick, the idiot with a cunning plan in the
Blackadder series. In Time Team, sounding like an enthusiastic primary
school teacher, Robinson turns out to be a rather good presenter; moreover
the computer graphics used to superimpose a Roman fort, say, on a picture of
the countryside as it is today, work very well. It is the underlying
structure of the programme which is irritating, having been modelled, it
seems, on Challenge Anneka. Instead of investigating King Alfred's
stronghold at Athelney in the normal manner, the archaeologists are obliged
to do it at the trot, in three days, in response to some sort of challenge
from a (supposed?) letter writer. The archaeology is in perpetual danger of
being smothered under the game element.
But even more annoying than the 'Never mind the programme, look at me' style
is the opposite extreme where the producers pretend that the material is
reaching the viewer untouched by human hand; quite unmediated. A prime
example was a recent edition of 40 Minutes called 'Caraline's Story' which
purported to reveal, solely through her own mouth, the history of a woman
suffering from anorexia and bulimia.
The difficulty with this approach is that the viewer has no way of knowing
how much credence to give to the subject: was Caraline's account of
childhood abuse the gospel truth or a classic case of False Memory Syndrome?
How should we know, the producer shirked his journalistic responsibility to
investigate and explain and left us to guess for ourselves. Worse, he had
shot Caraline's neurotic activities - bolting food and vomiting it down the
lavatory - in a way that made Polanski's Repulsion look like Bambi: huge
closeups of gobbling lips accompanied by amplified slurping effects, and
then horror-movie back lighting to give Karloff-like dramatisation to the
lavatory sequences. What you might call manipulator-on-the wall television.
Happily this season has also brought Further Abroad, a BBC2 series on
Fridays, presented by Jonathan Meades, which is impossible to categorise.
The first three of the five programmes have dealt with high buildings and
consequent vertigo, brewing and pubs, and golf courses. Still to come are
pigs and Belgium. Some might say that Meades' chief concern is architecture,
others that it is the English class system, and yet others that it is to
champion the old over the new. For comparison some of Lucinda Lambton's
programmes might come to mind, though you could be nearer the mark with John
Betjeman's poetry and even The Sloane Ranger Handbook.
The programmes are wonderfully funny, first because Meades is witty:
'Marmite, a German invention, a French name, an English institution. But
that's not so odd really, many of our institutions are imports; think of the
royal family, think of vindaloo, think of Rottweilers'. Second because he
takes trouble with his scripts, which demand that you listen: 'This
utilitarian landscape is golf's answer to, and unfortunate apeing of,
agri-industrial prairie. It refers only to itself.'
Third, Meades and his producers, David Turnbull and Russell England, have
set out deliberately to undermine and ridicule some of the supposed rules of
television presentation. An interviewee talks into the lens and years of
viewing tell us that Meades must be behind the camera and that in a moment
we shall see him in a reverse shot  . . except that we suddenly notice him
miles away in the background in his usual double-breasted blue suit and dark
glasses. So who is the interviewee talking to? Us of course. The golf
programme included the thesis that English golf courses are a form of
Scottish colonialism, so Meades appeared at the beginning, wandering onto
the links from a sunlit pine forest miming 'Annie Laurie' to an Andy Stewart
recording.
There are few things more suspect in the eyes of some English viewers than
cleverness. 'He's too clever by half', they say, and no doubt loathe this
series. Yet although Meades is sometimes flippant and occasionally
deliberately absurd he has serious points to make, whether about the motives
for putting up tall buildings, the social pretentions of some suburban
golfers, or the odd contrast between the high-tech surroundings of the
places where beer is brewed and the contrived merrie Englande atmosphere of
the places where it is sold. We tend to believe that, like effective
medicine, 'serious' programmes ought to be thoroughly unpleasant to ingest,
so the splendidly entertaining nature of this series may count against it.
But if there is any justice it will win awards.
It is inconceivable that the series should inspire enough imitations to lead
to a sea change in current affairs television generally because it depends
wholly upon Meades' idiosyncratic personality. However, it does prove that
outstanding programmes can be created which depend neither on soft-centred
celebrity presentation, nor on the scriptless fly-on-the-wall formula.

Was Rasputin a mad monk who liked to get his leg over? Or a misunderstood

Is there any difference between the two? Timewatch promises a revisionist
version of the Siberian peasant who had, supposedly, such influence on
Nicholas and Alexandra (8.00 BBC2). Even more sexually bizarre is American
artist Jeff Koons who takes pictures of his wife, the topless Italian MP
Cicciolina, doing the most amazing things to him with her tongue. He chooses
the John Hancock Centre in Chicago in Building Sights USA (8.50 BBC2).
The Day Today continues its appallingly accurate and consequently hilarious
spoof of television news (9.00 BBC2). Dispatches tries to discover whether
the agent causing BSE ('mad cow disease') could have passed into the human

In Middlemarch Ladislaw responds to Arthur Brooke's invitation to stay and
the Vincys are more desperate than ever to discover the details of old

FT  26 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Fading blueprint of a greener
world - Bronwen Maddox reviews David Pearce's latest book as he scrutinises
the UK's environmental performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Pearce cannot be faulted on his timing. The book that made his name,
Blueprint for a Green Economy, was published at the height of popular
'green' enthusiasm in 1989, when Pearce was adviser to Chris Patten, then UK
environment secretary. His second, Blueprint 2, which tussled with global
environmental threats, was published in 1991 in the run-up to the Rio Earth
Summit.
Now Blueprint 3*, which turns back to scrutinising the UK's environmental
performance, arrives in the week in which the government publishes its
strategy for 'sustainable development' - the UK's considered response to
Rio.
Pearce, now head of environmental economics at London University, has made
an important contribution to the environmental debate in each of these
books. He has argued steadily that values can - and should - be put on the
environment in forming government policy. While that principle is anathema
to those environmentalists who feel the environment is priceless, he should
be thanked for it.
Lack of such valuation leads to economic inefficiencies: people use too much
of natural resources such as the capacity of the oceans or land to absorb
pollution. The principle of valuation is also a good counterweight to the
anti-liberal streak in the environmental movement: those campaigners who
want to impose expensive conservation policies on the world without asking
people whether they are happy to pay the price.
In one of his most detailed valuations, Pearce argues that the 'social
costs' of road use - noise, pollution, wear and tear on roads, congestion
and accidents to pedestrians - amounted to between Pounds 23bn and Pounds
26bn in 1991. That was twice the amount fetched by road taxes; if the
motorist were to pay the full cost of using the roads, taxes would need to
double.
He will also win gratitude from the packaging industry for pointing out that
the piecemeal way in which the government is forming its waste management
policy could be highly expensive for industry without yielding the desired
environmental improvements.
So far so good, although he is the first to acknowledge that such valuations
are tentative and incomplete, particularly where they try to quantify the
health effects of pollution. He also undermines some of his argument by
adopting an academic's plaintive cry for theoretical perfection - he is
distressed that 'policy tends to evolve as a series of reactions to
particular issues rather than as a considered response to an exercise in
which priorities are ranked according to agreed criteria'.
But the more serious weakness of the book is its attempt to use these
valuation techniques in defining the course of 'sustainable development' for
the UK.
'Sustainable development' is a notoriously tricky concept which Pearce has
grappled with in earlier work. He has in the past suggested two definitions.
'Strong' sustainability, according to Pearce, means maintaining a country's
stock of natural resources, while 'weak' sustainability means maintaining a
country's total capital, including both natural and man-made assets.
But although Blueprint 3 treats these definitions as solid ground, safely
won, gaping holes remain in his theories. It remains very hard to say what
the definitions mean in practice. For example, in building new roads, a
country would have to weigh the benefits to motor users against the acres of
meadow which would be obliterated, to judge whether its overall capital -
natural and man-made - was maintained. But how many butterflies and
wildflowers are equivalent to how many miles of road?
That persistent problem in defining capital handicaps him in his judgments
about whether Britain's policies are sustainable - probably not, he
concludes.
It also makes it hard for him to develop one of the main parts of his
argument: the proposition that if a country fails to value the environment
properly, it is likely to be on an unsustainable path.
Of the three strands in this book - valuation, sustainability and criticism
of government policy - only the last is new. He has carried over much of the
first two themes - including their weaknesses - from previous books. Those
who have followed the development of Pearce's theories over the past four
years may well feel the blueprint is getting fainter.

Harry Tuley, chairman of mini-conglomerate Scapa, is becoming non-executive
chairman of Staveley Industries. He replaces Brian Kent, who is retiring
next month at the age of 61, after 16 years on the board of the measuring
and mechanical engineering company.
Kent had combined the roles of chairman and group managing director between
1987 and the autumn of 1992, when Roy Hitchens came in, from BOC, as chief
executive. Hitchens says that Kent is stepping down because his other
interests are taking up a lot of time. He becomes president of the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers in May.
Staveley employed headhunters to find Tuley, a Scapa veteran of 25 years
standing. 'The chemistry between the two of us is very good,' reckons
Hitchens, who, as an accountant, says he likes 'the counterpoint' of Tuley
being a trained engineer.
'It is not his company, but where he has operated - in America and
continental Europe - that is of interest to me' says Hitchens.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Errors in the name of ecology
 -Daniel Green considers a report which bolsters the case against banning
phosphate detergents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could two decades of environmental policy have been mistaken? Have the US,
Germany, Switzerland and many other countries unnecessarily forced changes
on their industries and consumers in the name of ecology? Yes, according to
the Phosphate Report* published today by Landbank, an environmental
consultancy.
The report is a life-cycle study which examines the environmental impact of
two kinds of detergents, phosphate-based and zeolite-based. Such studies try
to take into account every aspect of the production and use of a product
from raw material extraction to waste disposal.
Phosphates have been blamed for high levels of nutrients in rivers and lakes
that lead to the dominance of algae over other life forms. Many countries
have banned detergent phosphates as a result and encouraged a switch to
zeolites.
But the report concludes that there is virtually no difference between the
environmental effect of the two types of detergent, if all aspects of
production and consumption are taken into account.
It is a conclusion that might have been expected, given that the report was
sponsored by UK phosphate manufacturer Albright and Wilson, owned by the
Tenneco industrial group of the US.
But the two authors insist that they have been independent and objective.
Their credentials help: one is Bryn Jones, once director of lobby group
Greenpeace, the other is Bob Wilson, formerly a senior lecturer in
statistics.
They also claim that their report breaks new ground in the controversial
area of life-cycle analysis, a technique notorious for producing
disagreements among experts.
They pin their hopes on the Delphi Technique to iron out these differences.
This method requires a panel of experts to give their views by completing an
anonymous questionnaire. The results are summarised and fed back to the
panel.
The panel members are invited to reconsider their position, or give
arguments about why they are right. These arguments are then distributed to
the panel again. The process remains anonymous and can be repeated until a
consensus is achieved or irreconcilable positions established.
For the Phosphate Report, the panel assessed the environmental impact of 39
products generated by the likes of phosphate mining, road transport of
materials and electricity generation for manufacturing plants.
Each expert gave a score for the environmental impact of each pollutant
generated during the life cycle of the two types of detergent.
When the scores were added up, phosphate detergents scored 107 environmental
impact points, and zeolite detergents 110 points. Jones gives the error as
10 per cent.
This alone should bolster the case against banning phosphates but the report
is not finished yet. In its final section, the authors argue that it is much
easier to take phosphates than zeolites out of waste water.
Sweden already strips phosphates out of waste water and has banned
advertisements that claim that zeolites are greener.
There are signs of a rethink in Switzerland, where detergent phosphates were
banned in 1986 and phosphate-stripping plants built to protect lakes. The
report quotes Ulrich Zimmerman, head of water quality for the Zurich Water
Authority, calling for the ban on detergent phosphates to be revoked on the
grounds that it has failed to improve water quality.
The report concludes with several recommendations ranging from a call for
zeolite detergent manufacturers to abandon eco-friendly labels to a
suggestion that wind power be used to supplement electricity supplies at
Albright and Wilson's phosphate plant on the Cumbrian coast.
Of at least as much interest to consumers is the finding that phosphates are
better cleansers: almost 1 1/2 times as much zeolite detergent is needed to
produce the same cleaning effect.
Swiss consumers have discovered this already. Their increased consumption of
zeolite detergents, specialist stain removers and water softening machines
may have been behind a rise in foaming at water treatment works, the report
claims.

FT  26 JAN 94 / People: Shute recruits at Scottish Heritable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Shute, former chairman of BM Group, has strengthened his hold on
Scottish Heritable Trust, the struggling York-based mini-conglomerate in
which he holds a 10 per cent stake.
He is handing over the chief executive's job to Brian Craig, 47, a property
expert, and has also recruited Malcolm Mastin, 50, an old BM colleague, to
be an executive director.
Scottish Heritable Trust is in talks with its bankers on the refinancing of
its Pounds 24m debt; it has been selling off its industrial interests. The
appointment of Craig, a consultant to Styles, Whitlock, chartered surveyors,
is a further sign of transformation into a property company. Craig was a
founder of Brookmount and is managing director of Craig European, a private
property company.
Roger Shute, who took over from Edward Denison as chairman earlier this
month, will remain executive chairman. The company's shares were suspended
at 5p last November.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Left to regulate without
reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies are failing to capture the new international markets for
environmental technology, says a report* which claims British industry is
lagging well behind Germany, the world leader.
The report, conducted ahead of one of this spring's leading trade
exhibitions for environmental technology, analyses responses from 300
British companies, which make up around a tenth of the industry.
The clearest finding is that environmental regulation is the driving force
behind the market's growth. More than three-quarters of the respondents said
UK legislation was the reason for their customers buying environmental
technology, and 61 per cent gave European legislation as the main factor.
Ministers have been keen to emphasise that 'greener' can mean 'richer': that
some people can make money from environmental regulation even though others
will pay more. However, the report suggests that while the costs of
regulation are borne by UK companies and consumers, much of the value of the
market in environmental technology goes overseas.
The OECD and the US Environmental Protection Agency have both suggested that
the world market for environmental products and services is currently worth
Dollars 200bn (Pounds 135bn). They differ on estimates for its value by the
end of the decade: the OECD thinks Dollars 300bn, and the EPA doubles that
sum. But forecasters agree that the main growth will come from demand for
waste management, air pollution control and water treatment technology.
German companies have captured 21 per cent of that world market, the survey
estimates. In contrast, the 'nascent' British industry is made up mainly of
small companies, it says.

FT  26 JAN 94 / People: JCB digs deeper in search for European victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JCB is strengthening management of its European sales and service operation
to raise its share of what the Staffordshire-based construction equipment
producer has long viewed as its 'home market.'
Pierre Leboucher, formerly head of the company's French subsidiary, right,
has been appointed to the new post of European director.
He will henceforth be responsible for sales and distribution development
throughout Europe and for targetting the major markets of Germany, France,
Italy and Spain.
Leboucher is being succeeded as managing director of JCB France by Francoise
Rausch, far right, who now becomes one of the few women to reach such an
elevated position in what is still a male-dominated industry.
Leboucher's new job has been created by John Patterson, a JCB main board
director who last year was appointed managing director for worldwide sales
and service.
The European market is crucial for JCB; Europe, including the UK, accounts
for 72 per cent of JCB's Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m annual sales. The company
is Europe's largest supplier of construction equipment in unit terms -
although not in value.
Patterson says JCB lifted its share of a declining European market from 9.5
per cent to 11.8 per cent last year, based on the eight main product types
it competes in. But he wants to increase this to 15 per cent by 1996.
Leboucher's tasks will be to formulate how and where JCB expands on the
continent, as the market comes out of recession. He will also be taking
overall responsibility for, among other things, improving European logistics
and implementing a revised product strategy based around three groups -
heavy, main and compact lines.
Leboucher, who joined JCB in 1971, was one of the original team at the
French subsidiary, which later became the model for other European
operations. He sees increasing JCB sales in Germany as a top priority.
Rausch, meanwhile, is taking control of JCB's largest single export market,
apart from that of the US.
JCB France had sales of FFr400m last year but Rausch - who has been with JCB
for 21 years - believes sales could increase this year, helped by new JCB
products, as well as an overall market pick-up spurred on by public works
funding and lower interest rates.
Rausch says that though the French construction equipment market has fallen
by 50 per cent since 1989, it could rise by 5-10 per cent this year.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Recruitment: The benefits of a switchable personality -
Upheavals in the working world put premium value on learning to be
motivationally versatile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do so many managers fail after being promoted? If that question strikes
readers as having an antique air, you're right. The nine words in it were
the first the Jobs column's retiring writer ever penned on the subject of
management, in October 1967.
What leads me to exhume those words is not so much nostalgia as my surprise,
on coming across them in old cuttings, that I had ever started an article
with such a question. When I first asked it, the high rate of failure among
newly promoted managers constituted a serious risk for ambitious people of
the sort who read this column. But the world of work has undergone such
upheavals that, for those of you with careers still stretching ahead, the
important issues have changed radically.
The difference is not that managers have ceased falling down on receiving a
leg up. They still do so. What has made the change is that employers have
cut whole layers of management out of their hierarchies. As a result, where
future career prospects are concerned, the risk of failing after promotion
is now far less of a problem than getting promoted in the first place.
How severely the hatchet men have reduced the chances was illustrated
recently by IBM UK's chairman Sir Anthony Cleaver. He said his group was
cutting back to only four managerial tiers, which 'means a maximum of one
promotion every 10 years, and even this is for the one man who makes it to
the top.'
Although that one man - or woman - will no doubt often be an FT reader, the
speed of advance seems unlikely to appeal to thrusting ambitions. So those
of you who are impatient to make your mark will need to find other avenues
for your abilities. How, alas, is another matter.
One advantage today is that better sources of careers advice are available.
The handiest I know of is the computerised guide, Career Design*, which for
anyone investing the 40 hours needed to go through it properly, prompts a
searching self-analysis. Nevertheless I doubt that such *UK distributors
Careers by Design, Maple House, Green Lane, Padgate, Cheshire WA1 4JN.
exercises are personally sensitive enough to get to the heart of the affair,
which to my mind lies in individual motivation.
True, the particular ways in which people are motivated were important to
careers even before the wholesale removal of steps from promotion ladders.
But in those days, it was enough to find jobs suited to your characteristic
motivational pattern. If you were promoted to one that didn't match, you
still had a fair chance of finding another which did.
Today, however, there is far less chance of finding jobs that fit your
particular pattern. So the only way ahead may be to change your motivation
to suit such opportunities as are available. The bad news is that a lot of
psychologists think motivation is such a basic part of the human personality
that making such a change is well nigh impossible.
The good news is that some of them now think differently. They are the small
but seemingly growing number of shrinks at work on a newish development in
psychology called Reversal Theory. They believe they have cogent evidence
that most people not only can, but frequently do, change (or 'reverse')
their standard motivational pattern.
One switch we make - which I have mentioned in previous columns - is between
contrasting fundamental approaches to the things we are doing.
Sometimes we will be doing them solely as a means to some different end. An
example is if we are reading a textbook because we need to pass an
examination, which, in turn, will improve our job prospects - the theory's
term for that particular mode is telic. But there will be other occasions
when we are doing something just for the sake of doing it, such as when we
immerse ourselves in a novel simply because we feel like reading. The jargon
for that mode is paratelic.
Research by reversal theorists suggest that the differences between the two
approaches are far-reaching. For instance, people operating in a paratelic
way seem to be more innovative. It may be that, in the telic mode, they are
concentrating too hard on the specific, further goals they have in mind to
discover much that they don't know already. But as there are times when
focused effort is more important than creativity, and vice versa, career
horizons would be broadened by the ability to switch at will from one mode
to the other.
Moreover, the researchers say the same applies to another pair of
fundamentally different approaches to doing things. In one, the conforming
mode, the urge is to join in with the crowd, which is more often than not
conducive to effective teamwork. But the other negatavistic mode can
sometimes be more valuable, not least in resisting 'group-think' and the
gadarene rush into daftness if not destruction that goes with it.
The theory also identifies two further pairs of approaches which condition
our dealings with other people. At one end of the first pair is the
self-serving autocentric mode, the opposite being the urge to put someone
else first, which is termed allocentric. No matter which of them we are in
at any time, we can be seeking either mastery over the others or sympathy
from them.
Once again - as will surely be obvious to anybody who needs to motivate
people who cannot be simply commanded - the ability to switch voluntarily
between the opposites would expand career horizons. Unfortunately, the ways
in which the last two pairs interact are complex, and there is no longer
room to explain them in what is my next-to-last column. But the details can
be found in Reversal Theory - Motivation, Emotion and Personality, published
by Routledge at Pounds 14.99. Its author is one of the theory's originators,
Michael Apter, who works at Yale University.
Besides being supported by research in various countries, his brainchild
sheds more light on my own motivation than any other theory I've heard of.
So I went to see him while he was visiting his native Britain over the
Christmas holiday.
He too is concerned about the effects of upheavals in the world of work, not
only on individuals but on companies. For instance, he says that no
organisation can thrive without the wholehearted effort of employees whose
usual approach to doing things is telic and conforming. But an essential
part of such people's motivation is having clear and realisable goals, one
of which is progress up the promotional ladder.
Moreover one British company with a keen eye for psychological developments,
but which he won't name, has spotted such dangers. It has commissioned him -
together with the McMillan Partnership consultancy based in Beech Hill,
Berkshire - to set up workshops aimed at helping company staff to become
more motivationally versatile.
'The plan is to tutor them in ways of reversing modes,' Dr Apter said. 'The
most simple example is that, if you are in the paratelic frame and faced
with something you dislike doing, you can usually switch to the telic mode
by keeping your mind on the worst things likely to happen if you neglect the
chore any longer. And if you think that's easy for a typical paratelic to
do, believe you me that it isn't'

FT  26 JAN 94 / Management: Research round-up on quality and stress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of counselling in UK companies is more widespread even than in the
US, claims a survey published by the TDA Consulting Group of London.
Based on face-to-face interviews and 285 responses to a questionnaire sent
to human resources directors at the top 1,000 UK public- and private-sector
employers, the study suggests that 86 per cent of UK organisations, covering
80 per cent of the workforce, provide some form of counselling.
Research in the US between 1984 and 1992 shows that only 80 per cent of
organisations with 500 or more employees had employee assistance programmes.
Ninety-nine per cent of UK organisations, meanwhile, said that they had
recently undergone significant changes in structure which have had an effect
on the morale of their employees.
More than 50 per cent of human resources directors cited change management
and employee stress as the main issues they seek to address through
counselling. Very few organisations see counselling as a 'perk', most
expecting bottom-line benefits such as reduced absenteeism.
The international quality standard ISO 9000 has had a mixed press. But a
survey of organisations in the service sector, carried out by BDO
Consulting, carries a more positive message.
Seventy-five per cent of the near 300 respondents felt that the advantages
of ISO 9000 outweigh the costs. Improved consistency and efficiency head the
list of internal benefits, with improved quality of service, less waste,
better client retention and additional business also mentioned.
More than half of the respondents were implementing quality initiatives
beyond ISO 9000, such as total quality management.
Two thirds of respondents noted improved staff performance, while a little
over half had seen an improved attitude to customers. However, only 45 per
cent felt that staff motivation had improved.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Management: Enthusiasm and a mission to train - Lisa Wood
interviews the chief executive of Investors in People UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mary Chapman is getting used to the response at social gatherings when she
describes her new job. ''Chief executive of Investors in People UK. Umm.
I've heard of IIP.'' Then silence.
Chapman feels some sympathy. 'The name is getting to be known, but less well
understood is what IIP is about,' she says.
IIP is a national standard for effective training. It was developed by the
government as part of its strategy to address Britain's dismal record in
this area. Until now Training and Enterprise Councils have been responsible
for persuading employers to seek to attain the standard and validating it
when they have done so.
IIP, which was launched yesterday, will now inject a national dimension into
promotion and marketing. Supported by Pounds 2m of public funds, it should
ensure that standards of assessment remain consistent and of high quality.
Chapman brings enthusiasm to her new job, which she says is based on her
experience of working at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company, latterly as
director of personnel operations and management development for the group in
the UK. Like other French companies, L'Oreal subscribes to a training levy
which she says is evidence of a French national commitment to training.
The levy, she says, does not guarantee that training is good, but it
establishes a culture with the potential to succour training. 'L'Oreal did
just that,' she says, with the company's culture disseminating to its
overseas operations. 'Talking to my friends in this country I felt my then
employer did more than most of theirs to allow us to fulfil our potential as
well as uphold the quality of the company.'
Chapman believes IIP can help companies to be more competitive and employees
to be better skilled.
She says that IIP, contrary to many employers' expectations, is not about
spending more on training programmes. Rather it is a mechanism for assessing
whether or not a company's training fits its business needs. Attaining the
standard may require specialist help from consultants, for whom grants are
available.
So far the standard has been taken up mainly by the 'great and the good'
including Boots the Chemist, the retailing to drugs group; Grand
Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, and Land Rover, the
four-wheel-drive subsidiary of British Aerospace's Rover Group. The task now
is to disseminate it more widely.
'It is not enough to say it's good to train people,' says Chapman. 'You have
to be able to demonstrate how it benefits the bottom line in a way that
businesses can measure.'
IIP, she says, can also influence the individual development of employees.
At a division of Unilever, the management, while working on IIP, realised
that it was not making the most of its female employees. An affirmative
action programme has been introduced. Chapman says: 'Worked with properly,
the standard can help companies identify personnel matters such as these but
it is then up to the company to decide whether it wants to do anything about
it.'
Big companies, she says, can use the standard as an audit tool, that is, to
ask 'are we as good as we think we are at linking our training to our
business needs'. Small companies can use it at a more fundamental level,
which may result in new personnel and training practices.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Management: Eyeballing the finance director -
Metallgesellschaft has highlighted the risks of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huge losses on oil futures speculation which brought Metallgesellschaft, the
German metals and engineering group, to the brink of insolvency this month,
show how vulnerable some companies can be in today's fast-moving commodity
and financial markets.
The company's fate is likely to confirm the belief of many senior managers
that derivatives trading is dangerous and should be avoided.
'There is almost one (large corporate treasury loss) a year,' says Howard
Lovell, a partner in Coopers and Lybrand's financial risk management
practice, who cites other cases at Allied-Lyons and Showa Shell. 'And they
all seem to involve the use of derivatives.'
Senior managers are certainly right to be concerned. But, like it or not,
derivatives trading is a reality for most big companies: without it they
would have to absorb losses on their exposure to foreign currencies and to
raw materials prices.
Lovell says companies fall into three categories: those where the top
management understands futures and options trading and manages it
effectively; those where senior managers do not understand derivatives and
have put up a blanket barrier; and those companies using these sophisticated
instruments without proper controls.
Lovell believes that besides the extremely large losses that have been
reported, many companies lose smaller amounts through lack of technical
understanding. He knows of at least five companies which have lost up to
Pounds 200,000 in the past year - in one case because a corporate trader did
not properly understand the pricing of a transaction, and in another because
the tax implications of a trade were not calculated.
'Every company has different sets of exposures and has to work through what
its risks are, how big they are, the availability of a hedge, the cost, and
whether the risk is self-insurable,' says Stephen Crompton, director of
treasury at SmithKline Beecham. 'If a risk is very small, it may not be
worthwhile setting up the infrastructure to manage it.'
The first step is to decide the aims and policies of the treasury
department. Lovell says he is tired of corporate treasurers bemoaning the
difficulties of explaining derivatives to senior management: it is their
responsibility to do so. Managers should not allow themselves to be baffled
by the highly technical content. They should not be content with reams of
computer print-outs they do not understand.
'The basic thing is to be able to distinguish between the management of
exposure and speculation,' says Archie Donaldson, a director of The MTM
Partnership and a former treasurer of ICI. He warns against 'creating
exposure in order to have something to manage'.
Rather than banning speculation, though, it is necessary to identify genuine
exposure and how it will be managed. 'You should list and put through your
board the policies you are going to pursue,' adds Donaldson. For example,
this should include the fixed and variable rate portions of debt, how that
debt will be managed, and the limits of flexibility. The other key to safety
is the enforcement of these controls. Most large losses have been incurred
because dealers have doubled up on losing positions, or gone over their
exposure limits. Had these positions been detected and tackled earlier,
losses would have occurred but could have been contained.
Donaldson says checks are needed to counteract the impulses of human nature.
'When the trader gets it wrong, he still believes it is just a matter of
timing. Then he gets frightened and covers it up.'
While there is never going to be a system which a determined individual
cannot abuse, adequate monitoring should ensure early detection of fraud -
'before the treasurer gets on the plane', as one corporate dealer says.
'You can't stop somebody doing an unauthorised trade,' admits Derek Ross, a
partner of Touche Ross. 'But you can make sure it can be closed out the
following day.'
There are several important principles to follow, according to Ross: dealing
must be segregated from exchange of confirmations on trades (which is part
of the pre-settlement function), and payment instructions should be
independent.
In addition, the management reporting function, usually provided by the
accounts department, should be responsible for performance measurement. To
establish a successful hedging business, treasury should be integral to
day-to-day management.
At the most sophisticated end of the scale is British Petroleum, the
international oil group, whose treasury department is run like a bank. BP
has established the corporate treasurer's position as a route to a seat on
the board.
The original purpose of BP Finance was to raise debt and cover the company's
monthly running costs: these are in sterling while its receipts are chiefly
in dollars. Now, however, if it sees an opportunity to make a profit in a
market, it will take it, provided it is within certain set limits.
The finance operations are run as a separate profit centre which, as well as
defraying the costs of running the company, can also add its own profit to
the bottom line. But BP never splits out how much has been made or lost on
the treasury function.
Trading options requires a sophisticated understanding of a highly technical
area, as well as advanced systems. Companies should build up their trading
expertise very gradually. 'The problems in a lot of companies are caused by
letting amateurs play when they don't understand the risks they are taking,'
says one corporate trader.
Smaller companies may not want anything quite as professional as BP's
dealing room. But they should identify exactly what they do want before
starting out.
Derivatives have proved dangerous for corporate treasurers because their
complexity makes exposure harder to manage and to track. But used correctly
they allow companies to reduce exposure and focus more keenly on their core
business.
According to Neil Record, chairman of Record Treasury Management, the
currency risk management specialist, the first thing that happens after a
debacle like Metallgesellschaft is that a senior manager will ask his
finance director whether a similar disaster could occur. 'The finance
director should be able to look him in the eye and tell him why it couldn't
happen,' says Record.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Rail link groups face pressure to act quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector companies interested in financing and building the Pounds
2.6bn Channel tunnel rail link will be expected to declare their interest in
the next few weeks in spite of many question marks over the project.
Although it is expected to take the government at least two years to get
legislation authorising the line through parliament, negotiations will start
at an early stage on the form that private-sector involvement will take.
Several construction companies have declared an interest and at least two
consortia involved in earlier stages of the 68-mile rail link remain in
existence. Further groups are expected to emerge in the next few months.
Mr Peter Brittell of Sir Alexander Gibb, consultants to the project, said
the government would try to avoid the lengthy delays and cost overruns which
marked the construction of the Channel tunnel by seeking a consortium with a
balance of construction, banking and other interests.
Several construction companies, including Tarmac and John Laing, are
assessing the possibility of bidding.
Laing said it was still keen to carry out the work as part of a consortium.
In the early stages of the rail-link project it joined the Rail-Europe
consortium with a group of banks, engineering consultants and construction
companies, though it is not clear whether the same consortium would bid this
time.
Eurorail, a consortium of Trafalgar House, BICC and GEC, has also expressed
an interest. 'But there is a lot of detail which we still have to look at to
see precisely what they mean,' a spokesman said.
Ove Arup, an engineering consultancy involved in drawing up plans for the
route, said it intended to join one of the consortia being established.
Hochtief, a German contractor, is thought to be leading one consortium,
while UK consultants expect that Japanese and other continental European
groups may also be interested.
As well as work on the line there are sizeable contracts to be won to build
the stations.
The St Pancras terminus is expected to cost about Pounds 500m and will form
part of the main contract.
Blue Circle Industries, working with several local authorities, has put
forward plans for commercial development at Ebbsfleet, near Gravesend, while
a consortium including P&amp;O, Tarmac, Land Securities, John Mowlem and Newham
council has made proposals for a station at Stratford.
The government has decided to bring the private sector into the project
before putting legislation through parliament - against the advice of Union
Railway, which carried out preparatory work on the rail link - to allow the
private sector to influence the shape of the project at an early stage. This
does not, however, mean that it will have to spend money before it is sure
that parliament - in particular Tory MPs with irate constituents affected by
blight along the route - will approve the project. Mr Brittell said bidders
would expect the government to indemnify them against the political risk of
parliament not approving the project.
To increase the attractiveness of the project to the private sector, Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, has decided to give the winning bidder the
revenues from the train services.
European Passenger Services, which will run the trains on behalf of three
national railways, expects to start a limited service in May, increasing
capacity through the summer as more trains and carriages are delivered.

FT  26 JAN 94 / VAT on adult education mooted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday admitted that it was considering whether value
added tax should be imposed on adult further education classes.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the proposal was
'appalling'. She said there should be 'no place in a civilised society for
taxes on learning'. Sir John Cope, paymaster general, announced the review
in a parliamentary written answer released as MPs began debating the finance
bill implementing last November's Budget.
Responding to a question from Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour Treasury spokesman,
Sir John said Customs and Excise was considering the VAT position of evening
classes as part of a review of education and training services.

Cuts in the British Aerospace group continued with the announcement
yesterday of more than 400 additional job losses at its Royal Ordnance
munitions and guns division.
The reduction at Royal Ordnance's Chorley factory in Lancashire brings the
total of BAe job cuts announced in the past two weeks to about 1,760.
The latest measure brought sharp condemnation from unions and the Labour

FT  26 JAN 94 / Arms link to dam aid deal admitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and Malaysian ministers signed a protocol in 1988 tying defence
sales to civil aid projects, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said last
night, Kevin Brown and James Blitz writes.
Mr Hurd told the Commons in a written answer that the protocol was signed by
Mr George (now Lord) Younger, the then defence secretary, at the request of
the Malaysian government.
Mr Hurd said Lord Younger wrote to the Malaysian finance ministry in June
1988 to say that aid could not be linked to defence sales.
As a result the issue was not taken up in a memorandum of understanding on
defence procurement signed by Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, the then
prime minister, in September 1988.
However, the admission that a formal link between defence sales and aid was
agreed between the two will add to the controversy over British aid to
Malaysia's Pergau dam project in the late 1980s.
The Commons foreign affairs committee is expected to decide today to go
ahead with an investigation into the project, which has cost the Exchequer
about Pounds 300m and has been described as a 'very bad buy' by Whitehall
officials.
Members of the committee said last night that an investigation would
certainly take place, and that the body simply had to decide how and when to
proceed.
The Commons public accounts committee has recently examined the project and
is due to release a report this year. Its findings will criticise the
government for spending more money than was necessary on the project, which
is expected to lead to a rise in Malaysian electricity prices.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Portillo at the centre of latest Tory infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday emerged at
the centre of the latest ministerial infighting after the public relations
debacle over the government's 'back to basics' initiative.
Whitehall officials disclosed that Mr Portillo, the cabinet standard-bearer
of the Conservative right, had been defeated in his attempt to halt the
London CrossRail project in spite of a plea to Mr John Major.
With ministers suggesting that the defeat reflected a conscious effort by
the prime minister to reassert his authority, officials said Mr Portillo had
written to Mr Major 24 hours before the decision demanding that the rail
project be scrapped or, at worst, be delayed indefinitely. He opposed it on
grounds of cost and economic viability.
Mr Major instead took the advice of Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, that cancellation or delay would damage confidence in the future
of the City of London.
Officials also confirmed yesterday that Downing Street had blocked a move by
the chief secretary to follow up his attack on critics of Britain's
institutions with a speech last weekend emphasising his Euro-sceptic
credentials.
A draft of the proposed speech - for a weekend conference of the
Conservative Political Centre - ran into objections from Downing Street
before the conference.
Officials said Mr Portillo decided not to release an amended version to the
press.
By contrast the prime minister's office approved release of a speech by Mr
Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, which attacked some of Mr
Portillo's earlier remarks.
Mr Dorrell, the rising star of the Tory centre-left, challenged the chief
secretary's view both on the need to defend Britain's institutions and on
the threat posed to those institutions by the development of the European
Union.
In more tranquil times such differences between ministers would be seen as
part of the normal cut and thrust of debate in the government. But after the
struggle between the right and left of the Tory party over back to basics,
the latest incidents are being viewed in Whitehall as symptomatic of the
confusion clouding Mr Major's political agenda.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Company votes on political gifts urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies should be required to ballot shareholders before making donations
to political parties, the Institute for Public Policy Research said in a
report published yesterday.
The left of centre think-tank also recommended restrictions on donations
from overseas and a requirement for parties to publish the names of donors
giving more than Pounds 5,000 a year.
The report said the system of funding UK political parties had led to a gap
between the resources of the Conservatives and the opposition parties. In
the last parliament the Conservatives had an income of Pounds 34m, Labour
Pounds 16m and the Liberal Democrats Pounds 3m.
According to the institute this disparity has had a significant impact on
the way people vote.
The proposal to introduce restrictions on political donations follows the
disclosure last year that the Conservatives received substantial
contributions from overseas businessmen. The party faced further
embarrassment when it was revealed that it had received Pounds 440,000 from
Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive chairman of the collapsed Polly Peck group.
The report said that the UK should follow the rest of western Europe and
north America in introducing laws to ensure that parties can compete on a
more equal footing.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Milk board pressed on farm deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is pressing the Milk Marketing Board to allow dairy farmers
to revoke contracts they have signed with its planned successor body, Milk
Marque, in the light of changes the board has made to its reorganisation
plans.
The board said yesterday it would consider the matter once the government
had approved the revised proposals, although it argued that it was under 'no
legal compunction' to do so.
The board has dropped proposals to transfer the bulk of its assets to the
new farmers' co-operative and offered concessions to the dairy trade on its
milk-selling system in response to government concern that Milk Marque might
be anti-competitive.
Negotiations with agriculture ministry officials over the changes have
forced it to delay liberalisation of the Pounds 3.3bn milk market from April
to November.
The board now plans to float up to 49 per cent of its processing subsidiary
Dairy Crest, more than originally planned, to create a viable asset base for
Milk Marque in the absence of Genus, the cattle breeding service, and
National Milk Records, which are to be hived off.
Mr Peter Morgan, the board's head of corporate affairs, said the changes had
not compromised 'the core essentials in what we're proposing for Milk
Marque'.
He added: 'Our legal advice is that the contracts are perfectly valid. Those
that signed with Milk Marque did so voluntarily.'
He acknowledged, however, that the ministry wanted to ensure farmers were
content with the contracts they had signed.
'We don't have a problem with that. We wouldn't want to keep people in
against their will,' he said.
'It's an issue we have discussed with the ministry. We'll take a view after
the scheme has been approved.'
The government is understood to be concerned that producers came under
pressure to sign contracts with Milk Marque late last year before knowing
the final shape of the reorganisation scheme.
Nearly half the 28,500 dairy farmers in England and Wales have already
signed up.
The board has agreed to ease penalties against farmers who give less than 12
months' notice to terminate their contracts.
Farmers who give three to six months' notice will still forfeit 2 per cent
of their previous year's milk production.
But the penalty will be reduced if they agree to give more notice.
Mr Morgan said the board had not decided exactly how much more of Dairy
Crest to float in July, but majority ownership would remain in farmers'
hands.
The original plan was to sell off 25 per cent to 35 per cent. The board aims
to increase Milk Marque's working capital to Pounds 34.2m from Pounds 26.7m
under the earlier plan.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Traders in Islington fear for their survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confused traders and residents in north London near the point where the deep
rail tunnel through Islington will surface expressed anger yesterday at the
plans.
They said they have been struggling to get answers Union Rail, the company
set up to develop the Channel rail link, and the Department of Transport
about the impact on Caledonian Road.
Construction will involve digging a trench along the road and could take
from a year to five years to complete.
Several businesses along the road could suffer a severe drop in trade during
that period, as well as a blight on property prices.
Mr Stan Klepka, owner of a metal-polishing business and chairman of the
traders' association, said: 'Eighty per cent of the businesses would go
under because the road would be closed for three to five years.
'Everyone on this road who is not a wholesaler relies on passing trade
through Caledonian Road down to King's Cross.'
Mrs Dawn Spyrou, who owns Caledonian Super Cleaners, said she tried to sell
her business last year but nobody was interested.
She said: 'I absolutely think it was because of the rail link plans.'
Mrs Vijya Patel, owner of Newstop, about 60 yards from the proposed tunnel,
said: 'Even if the lease expired and we wanted to move we could not because
no one else wants to move in.'
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced that the tunnel would
surface in a 'grade-separated' junction east of Caledonian Road. Members of
a local pressure group yesterday called it a 'spaghetti junction'. They had
received a Union Rail map which suggested that the tunnel would surface west
of the road.
Mr Ken Cordner of Union Rail yesterday confirmed that the tunnel through
Islington would surface west of Caledonian Road, but the last stretch of the
route would be in a shallow tunnel beneath the road.
Mr Robert Bleasdale, who owns R. Bleasdale and Co, The Cast Iron Shop on
Caledonian Road, said he had heard rumours that the building next door to
his workshop would be demolished during the construction of the route. The
government has not offered him compensation for any damage that he believes
will be caused to his building and business.
The government may offer a voluntary purchase scheme for homes directly
affected by the rail link, but most residents do not think they will get a
decent sale price.
Ms Diana Shelly, a member of the Cally Rail Group, said: 'If they do offer
us a voluntary purchase it is not likely to pay off our mortgage. But at
least we're lucky as homeowners because we are in a position to fight for
some compensation. Council tenants are completely left out of the equation.
'When we moved in here it was quiet and beautiful, but with the construction
and the noise levels it is going to be disastrous.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / Tobacco advert curbs to be unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The health department is expected to announce soon that voluntary controls
on tobacco advertising are to be tightened following discussions with the
industry.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, launched a fresh round of talks
with cigarette companies in December after concern grew that parliament
might impose an advertising ban.
The voluntary controls are believed to include a ban on poster advertising,
tight controls on advertising in women's magazines, an end to shop-front
advertising and bigger health warnings on cigarette packets.
The talks followed an announcement that Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for
Rother Valley, intended to introduce a private members' bill banning all
cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco advertising except at the point of sale.
Mr Barron, who won third place in a backbench Commons ballot for the right
to introduce legislation, claimed the support of more than 200 MPs of all
parties, giving his bill a chance of becoming law.
The government could probably have found procedural ways of killing the
bill, but would prefer to be able to demonstrate to MPs that tougher
voluntary restraints are on the way.
The government is firmly opposed to legislative controls on tobacco
advertising, which ministers believe are less effective than voluntary
curbs.
About Pounds 60m is spent annually by the industry on advertising.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Religion teaching guide opposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New guidelines for religious education in the schools of England and Wales
were released yesterday and met with strong opposition from both teachers
and religious groups.
Under the government guidelines Christianity should take up at least half of
religion teaching time and would become a compulsory 'core' subject to be
taken from the age of five to the age of 16.
Time must also be found for pupils to cover the basic principles of
Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism by the age of 16.
Members of the Church of England General Synod warned that the proposals
could lead to an 'educational disaster', while leaders of non-Christian
faiths were alarmed that Christianity could overwhelm other faiths.
Teachers predicted problems in implementing the curriculum and the
Association of Teachers and Lecturers pointed out that 54 per cent of
teachers had no formal qualifications in the subject.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Backing for lower age of consent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect that the House of Commons may lower the age of consent for
homosexuals has increased significantly after a decision by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary, to back calls for it to be reduced from 21 to
18.
Mr Howard's decision to join a majority of the cabinet in supporting any
amendment proposing 18 may swing a number of rightwing Tory MPs in favour of
the change in next month's free Commons vote on the issue.
But the home secretary has told colleagues that he will strongly oppose a
reduction to 16 to align it with that for heterosexual sex. If no amendment
is tabled in favour of 18 Mr Howard will back maintenance of the present age
limit.
Mrs Edwina Currie, the backbench Tory MP, has tabled an amendment lowering
the age to 16, which has won the support of Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader.

FT  26 JAN 94 / BAe cuts further 400 arms jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuts in the British Aerospace group continued with the announcement
yesterday of more than 400 additional job losses at its Royal Ordnance
munitions and guns division, David White writes.
The reduction at Royal Ordnance's Chorley factory in Lancashire brings the
total of BAe job cuts announced in the past two weeks to about 1,760.
Six other plants in the group's civil aircraft and guided weapons divisions
were affected by the recent job cuts.
The latest measure brought sharp condemnation from unions and the Labour
party, which reiterated its call for a defence diversification agency to
cope with the impact of declining military business.
Royal Ordnance has been struggling to find export orders to offset reduced
UK requirements.
The company said the Chorley site would cease its current activity of
filling, assembling and packing large-calibre ammunition, with the loss of
421 jobs by the end of next year.
This part of Royal Ordnance's business will be concentrated at its Glencoed
plant in south Wales.
The cut will leave about 140 employees at the Chorley plant itself, in
addition to about 400 headquarters staff.
Royal Ordnance's total UK workforce, spread over 12 sites, will be reduced
to about 4,500 compared with 16,000 when the government sold the company to
BAe in 1987. A further 1,000 are employed in Germany.
The latest cut comes in spite of the award last October of five-year
ammunition contracts from the Ministry of Defence, worth about Pounds 200m.

FT  26 JAN 94 / New mine operators warned of liabilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private mine operators wishing to take over former British Coal pits in the
Durham coalfield may face legal action from Durham County Council - unless
the government spells out where responsibility lies after privatisation for
abandoned mineworkings.
Mr Len James, chairman of the county council's environment committee, warned
yesterday that unless the coal industry privatisation bill specifies who is
responsible for the potential problems of minewater pollution, methane and
subsidence, his council may seek injunctions against any incoming private
operators in an attempt to force them to accept liability.
'Prospective purchasers could find their plans bogged down in a legal
quagmire while we continue to fight for what we believe is right,' said Mr
James.
The question of responsibility for coalmining's historic legacy affects many
mining areas of Britain, but is of immediate concern in County Durham which
is riddled with mineworkings dating back centuries. Minewater pumping, which
prevents pollution, has been costing British Coal Pounds 6m a year in that
area.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday the bill covered the
environmental issues raised. British Coal yesterday won planning consent
from West Glamorgan county council for an 800-acre opencast mine overlooking
Neath Valley, south Wales. The mine, which will employ 140 people, is
expected to produce 3m tonnes of anthracite over nine years.

FT  26 JAN 94 / CBI denies anti-union campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies are not pursuing an anti-union offensive among their
employees, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
The sharp decline in trade union membership and collective bargaining since
the mid-1980s reflected 'a shared wish in the workplace for dealings on a
different basis,' the CBI said.
It told the Commons employment committee's inquiry into the future of
unions: 'There is no evidence that employers have been forcing the pace.
'A substantial number of employers work with trade unions in their
businesses and find the relationships more or less satisfactory. More
harmonious relations and greater involvement in the workplace may provide
some positive reasons for employees to be less interested in union
membership.'
In a document submitted to the committee, it said 'there is still scope for
a continuing role for trade unions' but only if they adapt to change in an
enterprise rather than obstruct it. The CBI argued that unions should
concentrate on providing advice and support facilities for individual
workers in 'seeking to invoke their legal rights'.
It said member companies 'anticipate dealing more directly with the
workforce and building up relationships on an individual basis - but
frequently to complement, rather than replace collective bargaining'.
The CBI said unions should 'never again' have 'the capacity to disrupt the
commercial and day-to-day life of the nation and exercise excessive
influence over government experienced in the late 1970s'.
But it backed the retention of the Trades Union Congress on statutory bodies
such as the Health and Safety Commission, the conciliation service Acas, and
the commissions on racial equality and equal opportunities. A survey of 79
British employer organisations found that in the past three years they have
undergone a change of role from collective bargainers with trade unions to
advisory and lobbying bodies. The survey is published today by Industrial
Relations Services, the research body.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Bill to restore trade union rights at GCHQ given formal
first reading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A bill to restore trade union rights at GCHQ, the government's
intelligence-gathering centre in Cheltenham, was given a formal first
reading in the Commons yesterday - the 10th anniversary of the ban - though
it has no chance of becoming law for lack of parliamentary time.
The Commons voted by 222 votes to 69, a majority of 153, to allow Labour MP
Mr David Winnick to introduce the bill.
Ten of the sacked workers earlier delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street
calling for the ban to be lifted.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Chamber members to vote on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for the merger of north-east England's three chambers of commerce to
create one of the UK's biggest chambers will be put to the vote next week.
Unveiling details of the proposal yesterday, the senior figures in all three
chambers stressed their support for the merger.
They believe a merger would strengthen the north-east's business voice and
enhance the services available to member companies while achieving economies
of scale.
The 100 members of the Tynedale Chamber have already backed the plans. On
Monday, extraordinary general meetings in Billingham and Gateshead will seek
the support of the 2,800 members of the Teesside and Tyne and Wear chambers.
If they agree, the merger will be completed by January 1995, creating one of
the five-largest chambers in the UK.
The new North East Chamber would have almost 3,000 members, from companies
such as ICI to individual entrepreneurs, and an annual turnover, including
training activities, of about Pounds 4m.
It would continue to be owned and run by its members and is expected to work
closely with the emerging national one-stop shop Business Links advice
network, championed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
The three chambers' present 51 staff would continue to be employed by the
merged chamber. A new head office in Durham is planned, supported by
satellite offices based in Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Durham, South Tyneside
and Newcastle.
The chamber would also have a presence in several other locations in the
region. It is expected to seek help from the Department of Trade and
Industry towards the Pounds 224,000 restructuring costs.
The chief executive post for the new body would be advertised.
The proposed merger accords with the Association of British Chamber of
Commerce's strategy of creating a 'quality network' by forming larger
chambers.
At present, it has 110 member chambers in the UK, representing 85,000
businesses. Its aim is to reduce the number of chambers in the next few
years to about 50, through mergers and joint operational arrangements.
The proposed merger was described yesterday by Teesside Chamber president Mr
Brian Beaumont as 'the biggest single event in the long history of the three
chambers'.
Tyne and Wear Chamber traces its roots back to 1815, making it one of
Britain's oldest chambers.
Teesside's Chamber's origins lie in the Stockton-on-Tees Chamber, founded
131 years ago.
Tynedale, which covers part of Northumberland, was founded in 1984.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Construction orders up in private and public sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of construction orders won by contractors in the UK rose by a
tenth to Pounds 18.06bn during the first 11 months of last year compared
with the corresponding period in 1992.
Figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment indicate
that a broad-based recovery has begun in one of the worst-hit industries
during the recession.
According to the department the improvement in orders accelerated during the
latter part of last year.
The total value of orders at constant 1985 prices, after allowing for
seasonal variations, were 14 per cent higher during September, October and
November than the previous three months, and 23 per cent higher than during
the corresponding period a year earlier.
Officials said that new orders during the latest three-month period rose in
every work category compared with the corresponding period in 1992.
The biggest increases over the 11 months were in public and private-sector
housing where the value of orders in current prices rose by 35 per cent and
19 per cent respectively.
Public-sectors orders, other than for infrastructure, rose 21 per cent on
the same basis while private industrial orders rose by 7.8 per cent.
Infrastructure orders were 2 per cent and private commercial orders 1.3 per
cent lower over the corresponding 11 months in 1992.
Contractors say that orders have begun to increase but remain concerned
about low prices.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, has
warned that too many companies are charging suicidal prices. This threatened
to undermine the recovery in domestic orders.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Common salary bargains sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Management Board, the employers' body, has drawn up an
industrial relations strategy seeking single-table bargaining and a common
pay-review date for all sectors of employment.
Mr Charles Nolda, the board's head of negotiations, said it aimed to have a
system in place by April 1996.
One of the main difficulties is agreeing a pay-review date. White-collar
staff settle in July and manual workers in September.
The board wants a unified date of April 1, with negotiations completed
earlier to allow authorities to build their results into budgets.
The strategy - likely to involve more than 1.5m employees - has been
developed in response to government pressure on local authorities to move
away from a nationally negotiated framework.
The board wants to preserve a national framework around common core
conditions, including a single pay spine. One proposal is to divide the
national agreement into two parts, imposing core conditions universally but
allowing others to be modified at local level.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities,
said yesterday it was time to abolish the 'officers and men' mentality that
permeated its national agreements. He added the association remained
committed to national collective bargaining.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Public-sector views 'harden' on pay freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinion among public-sector workers has hardened in the past few weeks
against the government's public-sector pay bill freeze, according to union
leaders, who believe there is a danger of industrial conflict in the early
summer.
'Our members were subdued. Now they are saying we have had enough,' said one
senior union official.
But the unions are expected to drop their plan for a day of action on April
11, expected to be endorsed at a TUC meeting next Tuesday.
Instead they aim to gain public support through a long campaign focusing on
the lower-paid public-sector workers.
Union leaders yesterday called on the government to abandon the pay bill
freeze and honour the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies,
which cover 1.4m public sector workers, including nurses, teachers, doctors
and dentists, and the armed forces.
Review body reports for doctors and nurses - now with the government -
suggest rises of up to 3 per cent.
Members of the review bodies are in a politically sensitive position. They
must recommend what they believe public-service workers should be paid
compared with similar workers in the private sector, but they do not want
their reports to be rejected by the government.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, associate general secretary of Unison, Britain's
biggest union, said: 'Any undue pressure or interference by ministers would
be a bitter betrayal of the review bodies' key role in keeping industrial
stability.'
He warned that there would be a backlash among nurses and other
public-service workers if the government tried to attach productivity
strings to their pay rises this year.
Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said: 'Nurses expect to be treated no differently over their pay than
members of parliament who received 2.7 per cent this year.'
Nurses, midwives and health visitors are seeking pay rises of up to 10 per
cent.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, accused the government yesterday of
making up its policy of freezing the public-sector pay bill 'on the hoof'.
'The policy as it stands blatantly discriminates against public-sector
workers,' Mr Monks said. 'It will create enormous problems with retention of
staff and recruitment and widen the pay gap between different grades, not to
mention the effect on morale.'
He added: 'We will see a massive pay gulf opening up between the public and
private sectors. The policy is just not sustainable.'
The Institute of Directors called on the government yesterday to abolish
national pay bargaining for the public sector. 'It is the last vestige of
the corporate state and should be swept away,' said the institute's policy
director Mrs Ann Robinson.
'It is no longer appropriate that teachers and nurses are paid exactly the
same throughout the country on a national pay scale,' she added.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Fimbra call over watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for people who work in the financial services industry to be fully
involved in the proposed new retail financial services watchdog came
yesterday from one of the regulators it is to replace.
The council of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent
financial advisers, said it was 'vital' that there should be proper
involvement by practitioners, in the interests of investor protection.
The statement is a modest boost for the planned personal investment
authority, since Fimbra does not take issue with the proposal that only nine
of the 19-strong PIA board should be practitioners.
Independent financial advisers, who make up Fimbra, have been among the most
outspoken critics of the PIA proposals, arguing that in their current state
they do not represent self-regulation.
At the same time, however, the statement offers a clear warning about the
sort of structure Fimbra wants to see the PIA adopt.
It urges strongly that practitioners should be fully involved in committees
and working parties which report directly to the PIA board.
This reflects unease within the IFA sector that the PIA may be an
'executive-driven' regulator - closer to the model of the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, than to Lautro, the
self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, where
committees play a greater role.
The PIA board will meet today to discuss its draft prospectus and
application to be recognised as a regulator.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Smith calls for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday called for an immediate cut in
interest rates to reduce the risk of the recovery being choked off by
impending tax increases.
Speaking in Bonn he urged the government to co-ordinate further interest
rate reductions with Britain's European Union partners.
'This is particularly important in Britain where the Conservative government
are forcing through massive tax increases which even the chancellor of the
exchequer now admits will check the recovery,' he said.
Addressing a 'Euro-conference' staged by Germany's SPD social democratic
party, Mr Smith argued that the consequences of allowing recovery to falter
were 'too serious to contemplate'.
He said: 'The cohesion of our own communities is at stake. Recession and
economic decline are clearly the breeding ground of crime, intolerance and
racism.
'Europe cannot afford a downward spiral that would threaten not just our
prosperity but our democratic way of life.'
As MPs at Westminster began considering the finance bill implementing
chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget, Mr Smith said the issues of
jobs, investment and growth were back at the top of the economic agenda
'where they always should have been'.
But he urged his audience not to let the right dominate the debate about
jobs 'as they did over inflation in the 1980s'.
Signalling one likely theme of Labour's European election campaign in June
Mr Smith said there was a clear 'jobs battleground' ahead.
'It is a choice between a high-wage, high-tech, high-skilled route to the
highest possible levels of employment and the Conservatives' low-paid,
low-skilled, insecure, unsafe, deregulated economics of the sweatshop.'
What was needed for Europe to prosper was a 'self-confident, adaptable,
highly skilled and participative workforce,' Mr Smith said.
'None of these qualities will be present in a sweatshop economy that drives
down wages, removes employment rights and relies on fear to provide
flexibility at the workplace.'
Touching on what has recently been a favourite subject of the Conservatives
Mr Smith said economic recovery was also necessary for the EU to fulfil its
wider responsibilities by doing 'all that we can to help the people of
eastern and central Europe'.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Gas regulator poised to announce tariff move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, is to announce this week whether it will
relax the tariff formula which sets the price British Gas can charge to its
monopoly market of about 18m residential customers.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, told the Commons trade and
industry committee yesterday that she had informed British Gas of the
decision. An announcement will be made at the end of the week.
The main element of the tariff formula is the efficiency factor, set in 1992
at the level of the retail prices index minus 5 percentage points. Last year
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that it be relaxed to RPI
minus 4 points because British Gas had lost a large share of its firm
contract market of mainly industrial and commercial users to new
competitors.
British Gas says that it accepted RPI minus 5 points on the basis that it
remained a fully integrated company with a monopoly of customers using up to
25,000 therms a year. The government has demanded the complete separation of
the transport and storage business from the trading arm and the monopoly
ceiling has been reduced to 2,500 therms a year.
Ms Spottiswoode was confident that the introduction of phased competition in
the domestic market from 1996 and its full liberalisation in 1998 should
bring prices down, even for low-volume consumers.
She was against retaining price controls any longer than necessary, but
would do so beyond 1998 if British Gas became the 'rump supplier' holding
most of the social obligations of the industry. 'I am very keen that British
Gas faces a level playing field and does not wind up with all the social
obligations,' she said.
Ms Spottiswoode admitted that Ofgas, which under its previous director Sir
James McKinnon had a stormy relationship with British Gas, had occasionally
'exceeded its powers' in some of its dealings with the company.
Questioned on whether the planned liberalisation of the gas market ignored
environmental and energy-efficiency issues, Ms Spottiswoode said she did not
believe a regulator should impose levies on gas customers which were
tantamount to 'regressive' taxes.
She noted that two schemes put forward for her consideration by the Energy
Saving Trust would result in a levy which would raise as much as Pounds 750m
to the year 2000.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Training standards body launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A business-led body called Investors in People UK was launched yesterday to
boost national promotion of the IIP standard, which seeks to link training
to the business needs of companies.
The organisation is financially supported by the government and is chaired
by Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley, which owns the north London
stadium.
Board members include Mr John Adstead, personnel director of J. Sainsbury,
Mr Terry Morgan, managing director of Land Rover, and Mr Leif Mills, general
secretary of Bifu, the banking union.
The standard, which has been developed by the government, is promoted by
training and enterprise councils and their Scottish equivalents, local
enterprise companies, which also validate whether a company has reached the
appropriate levels of training and staff development to attain IIP. The new
body will seek to ensure that uniform stand ards of assessment are set.
To be recognised, an employer must make a public commitment to employee
development so that staff can achieve the business objectives of the
organisation, regularly review the training and development needs of all of
its employees, and then evaluate the effectiveness of training.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Labour move against VAT on fuel defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's attempt to overturn the imposition of value added tax on domestic
fuel was defeated by a government majority of 17 (321-304) in the Commons
last night.
Tory backbenchers who have criticised the new impost refused to join with
Labour MPs in voting against it on the grounds that their amendment to the
finance bill would have wrecked the entire Budget introduced in November.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, forecast that Labour's
campaign to discredit the Conservative party's claim to be the party of low
taxation would boomerang by the time of the next general election.
He told jeering Labour MPs that while they were 'sitting pretty' now, they
would not be feeling so clever later on when they had to face the voters
with their plans for increasing public spending on health, education and
other projects.
Mr Portillo insisted: 'There is an unbreakable link between what governments
spend and what they must raise in taxation.' He met a barrage of protests
from Labour MPs when he refused to accept that the Conservatives had won the
last general election on a false prospectus, involving promises of further
tax cuts.
Mr Portillo condemned the refusal of Labour leaders to follow normal
practice by negotiating a voluntary timetable for the discussion of the
417-page bill - the longest ever introduced to the Commons - and left little
doubt that the government would use the parliamentary guillotine to curtail
debate on its line-by-line committee stage.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said that the bill increased 12
significant taxes and represented a historic moment in British politics.
It marked a decisive turning point against the Conservative party, clearly
demonstrating that its pledges on tax cuts had been betrayed. To Labour
cheers she told Conservative MPs that their integrity lay 'in tatters' and
that they had nothing left.
She firmly rebuffed Tory backbenchers who challenged her indictment by
quoting the promises to cut taxes which they had made to their constituents.
Ms Harman called on Tory backbenchers who had attacked the imposition of VAT
on domestic fuel to vote for the Labour amendment.
Mr Portillo argued that it was the natural instinct of the Conservative
party to control public expenditure and reduce taxation, while Labour had a
perpetual desire to increase spending and raise taxes. He said: 'Nothing
since the last election changes the validity of that choice put before the
British people.'
Appealing to the loyalty of Tory backbenchers, Mr Portillo warned: 'Our
recovery will depend on a clear, sustained determination to take difficult
decisions now in order to provide the basis for long-term prosperity.'
Mr Portillo, pressed about the impact on the economy, endorsed the judgment
of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that the recovery was strong enough to
be proof against any pressures imposed by tax rises.
The bill was given a second reading by a majority of 31 (327-296).

FT  26 JAN 94 / Marine insurers report improvement in results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rises in insurance rates paid by shipowners have led to an improvement in
the results of London-based insurance companies specialising in marine
insurance.
The Institute of London Underwriters, which provides services to 74 London
marine and aviation companies, said yesterday that its marine underwriters
were experiencing the strongest upturn in rates for many years.
Yet it warned that it would be some time before profitability was restored,
following severe price competition and heavy losses in recent years.
At least 18 companies withdrew from the market last year. The institute said
40 members had resigned since 1990.
Mr Peter Evans, the institute's chairman, said: 'The London market is
undergoing a transformation on a scale never seen before and at a speed hard
to comprehend.'
Institute companies - which account on the same three-year basis as Lloyd's
 -said preliminary figures showed a strong rise in profitability last year.
Premium income registered for hull business increased from Pounds 361m in
the first year of the three-year 1991 account, to Pounds 624.2m for the
first year of the 1993 account. In the same period hull claims rose to
Pounds 63.5m from Pounds 60.5m. Underwriters saw a similar improvement in
cargo and aviation business.
Last year saw a sharp drop in marine casualties, with 121 vessels of 500
tonnes or more lost, compared with 134 in 1992.
The value of ships lost in 1993 is expected to exceed the 1992 figure of
Dollars 590m, when figures are finally confirmed.
Aviation underwriters have also increased premium levels. Total losses of
western-built jet airliners fell from 26 in 1992 to 22 in 1993, but the
value of claims rose to Dollars 433m (Dollars 432m). Partial losses rose to
42 (Dollars 302m) in 1993 from 26 (Dollars 112m) in 1992.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Labour MP's death will test Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death yesterday of Mr James Boyce, the Labour MP, presents the
government with a daunting electoral test in the by-election in his
Rotherham constituency.
Mr Boyce, 46, had been ill for some time. It was announced recently that he
would carry out his duties from home while he waited for a heart transplant.
He had a majority of 17,561 in the South Yorkshire constituency at the 1992
general election, with 63 per cent of the vote. The Conservative candidate
was second with 23.7 per cent of the vote.
The by-election could provide an opportunity for a return to the Commons of
one of several Labour MPs defeated at the election, including Ms Sylvia
Heal, a former frontbencher.
However, interest will focus on the Conservatives' ability to prevent
erosion of their vote by Labour and the Liberal Democrat party, which polled
12.3 per cent at the election.
A poor performance, even in such a solid Labour seat, would confirm the low
standing of Mr John Major's government, especially if the Conservatives also
do badly in the local and European elections in the spring.
Mr Boyce was a former foundry worker who joined Labour in 1979 and won
Rotherham at the last election after serving as a Sheffield city councillor.
He was beginning to make his name in the Commons as an authority on housing,
employment and training.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said Mr Boyce was a fine colleague and an
excellent constituency MP. 'That he should die at such a young age is a
tragedy,' he said.

FT  26 JAN 94 / ITN negotiates cuts in pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITN, the television news company, has negotiated a pay cut for 26 engineers
responsible for news links and five other employees. Supervisors earning
Pounds 44,000 a year will have their pay reduced to Pounds 36,000 over three
years. Engineers pay is going down from rates approaching Pounds 40,000 to
Pounds 33,000. In return they will be getting a one-off Pounds 6,000 payment
in this month's pay packets.
The deal was agreed by Bectu, the broadcasting union, as an alternative to
the loss of two jobs planned in ITN's redundancy programme.
Reuters Television, the company formed after the Reuters takeover of the
Visnews agency, is planning to derecognise Bectu when it relocates within
London in March.

The UK cable television industry plans to spend Pounds 1.2bn this year in
building the networks that carry both television channels and
telecommunications services.
A survey by the Cable Television Association found that members plan to
build cable networks past 1.6m homes this year and 2m homes next year,
giving a total of 6.6m homes with access to cable.
The extra construction will increase the number of people in the industry by

FT  26 JAN 94 / Independent chiefs consider auction as last resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An auction for Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday, has not been ruled out if satisfactory bids are not
received soon, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of the loss-making newspaper publisher, is
becoming increasingly exasperated by the delay in receiving a formal bid for
the company from the consortium put together by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith,
the main founder of The Independent.
Pressure is being put on the consortium, which includes Mirror Group
Newspapers, to submit a bid as soon as possible.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, is likely
to submit a counterbid soon after this, possibly with another newspaper
group.
If the process becomes so delayed that the future of the titles is
threatened, a clear option for the non-executive directors would be to hold
an auction, although that would be seen as a last resort.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Mirror trial delayed by settlement talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trustees for the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme were last night
trying to agree an out-of-court deal with securities firms from which they
are seeking Pounds 175m in allegedly misappropriated assets and damages.
The funds are part of the more than Pounds 440m of pension assets which
disappeared from schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The talks have delayed the start of a civil trial which was set to start in
the High Court yesterday. Invesco MIM, Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management,
Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse are named in the case. The
individual position of each of the defendants was unclear last night.
It is understood, however, that Lehman Brothers, which is separately the
subject of a Pounds 77m writ from liquidators for Bishopsgate Investment
Management, the Maxwell-owned fund management company, had been discussing a
possible settlement in that case. Lehman Brothers, while insisting that it
believes it has a strong case, has said it is only interested in a global
settlement embracing all legal actions against it and involving all the
financial institutions against whom the pension schemes have made claims.
Sir Peter Walker, appointed by the government to mediate between the
parties, is seeking a global settlement involving agreements between all the
schemes and all the banks.
Last night's talks were aimed at averting a trial expected to last six
months and to cost several million pounds in legal fees. Both sides are
anxious to avoid a trial because of the adverse publicity for the financial
institutions and the fear of squandering scarce pension assets on legal
fees.
The trial is due to start today.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Yard puts middle-aged on apprentice scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen semi-skilled middle-aged workers at the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner
Govan shipyard on the Clyde have been saved from redundancy by the
introduction for the first time of an apprenticeship scheme for older
workers.
The agreement between Kvaerner's management and unions gives semi-skilled
workers whose jobs are redundant a chance to learn a range of skills,
leading to better prospects of job security.
Problems with state assistance for the scheme may also lead to a shake-up in
the way re-training is funded in Scotland. Under rules governing Training
For Work, the main training programme for the adult unemployed, Scottish
Enterprise was unable to give the shipyard any money for the
apprenticeships. It hopes to be able to change the rules soon.
Mr Bobby Gordon, director of personnel at the shipyard, said: 'Scottish
Enterprise, which welcomed the scheme, told us the men would have to be made
redundant before they could give us any assist-ance.
'But unemployment would affect these men's pension rights and is also
against the spirit of what we are trying to do in an area where there is 25
per cent unemploy-ment.'
Mr Gordon said the company, which had been seeking up to Pounds 5,000 from
Scottish Enterprise, was committed to the scheme but felt other employers
might be deterred.
Scottish Enterprise said rules for Training For Work did not cover an
individual under threat of redundancy. It said it would 'support the
relaxation of these rules in circumstances such as these and we will be
encouraging the Scottish Office to be much more flexible in the application
of the rules'.
But it said local enterprise companies had the power to support such
projects.
Working practices at the yard have been radically changed since Kvaerner
took over the yard in 1988. Mr Gordon said the principal component of the
yard's competitiveness was its labour force and efforts had been made to
support them, including better training.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Portillo seeks to repel Labour's tax attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's campaign to discredit the Conservative party's claim to be the
party of low taxation would boomerang by the time of the next general
election, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, forecast in
the Commons last night.
He told jeering Labour MPs that while they were 'sitting pretty' now they
would not be feeling so clever when they had to face the voters with their
plans for increasing public spending on health, education and other
projects.
Mr Portillo, moving the second reading of the Finance Bill implementing the
Budget proposals, insisted: 'There is an unbreakable link between what
governments spend and what they must raise in taxation'.
He met a barrage of protests from Labour MPs when, like Mr John Major, the
prime minister, he refused to accept that the Conservatives had won the last
general election on a false prospectus, involving promises of further tax
cuts.
Mr Portillo condemned the refusal of Labour leaders to follow normal
practice by negotiating a voluntary timetable for the discussion of the bill
 -the longest introduced to the Commons since the second world war - and
left little doubt that the government would use the parliamentary guillotine
to curtail debate on its line-by-line committee stage consideration.
Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow chief secretary, said in a hard-hitting
speech that the bill increased 12 significant taxes and represented a
historic moment.
It marked a decisive turning point against the Conservative party, clearly
demonstrating that its pledges on tax cuts had been betrayed. To Labour
cheers she told Conservative MPs that their integrity 'lies in tatters' and
that they had nothing left.
She firmly rebuffed Tory backbenchers who challenged her indictment by
quoting the promises to cut taxes which they made to their own constituents.
Ms Harman called on Tory backbenchers who had attacked the imposition of VAT
on domestic fuel to vote for a Labour amendment to the bill which sought to
remove it.
Mr Portillo argued that it was the natural instinct of the Conservative
party to control public expenditure and reduce taxation while, in sharp
contrast, Labour had a perpetual desire to increase spending and raise
taxes.
He said: 'Nothing since the last election changes the validity of that
choice put before the British people.'
Appealing to the loyalty of Tory backbenchers, Mr Portillo warned: 'Our
recovery will depend on a clear, sustained determination to take difficult
decisions now in order to provide the basis for long-term prosperity'.
Pressed about the impact of the tax increases imposed by the bill on the
economy, he endorsed the judgment of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that
the recovery now in progress was strong enough to be proof against them.
Mr Portillo acknowledged that the extension of value added tax to domestic
fuel had been 'a most difficult decision' and thanked Tory backbenchers for
supporting it.

FT  26 JAN 94 / ICI faces tough talks on HFCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI, the UK's biggest chemicals company, faces tough negotiations with the
government over the future of Pounds 250m of investment in production of
gases that are now seen as environmentally damaging.
In a document published yesterday on meeting obligations under treaties to
protect the atmosphere, the government says it is committed to reducing
emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to their 1990 levels by the year
2000.
HFCs are used in refrigerators and air-conditioning units to replace
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which damage the ozone layer. But HFCs are
themselves greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming and, because
they are new products, UK emissions in 1990 were negli-gible.
ICI insisted yesterday that HFCs did not damage the environment any more
than other products.
Mr John Beckitt, ICI's business manager for the product, which is sold under
the name Klea, said: 'In many applications they reduce energy consumption
and therefore carbon dioxide emissions.'
It has three plants - one in Runcorn, Cheshire, one in Louisiana in the US
and half of a joint venture in Japan. Total investment is Pounds 135m, of
which Pounds 30m is in the UK.
The document acknowledges that the UK will have difficulties meeting the
emission target by 2000.
It says the government 'will therefore be exploring further with HFC
producers and consumers how best to make progress in relation to the UK
commitment'.
It says it will be 'exploring the scope for voluntary agreements to ensure
that (HFC) emissions are minimised and not used where unavoidable if safe,
practical and more environmentally acceptable alternatives are available.'

FT  26 JAN 94 / Guidelines on arms 'pushed' says Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday invoked British trade
interests to justify the government's decision to approve the export of
machine tools less than two weeks before the invasion of Kuwait, in spite of
intelligence warnings that they could be used in weapons making.
Mr Hurd, giving evidence to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, said a
ministerial meeting he chaired on June 19 1990 had taken into account the
potential competition from other European countries.
The decision also followed the relaxation of international regulations on
the sale of western technology to former Communist countries.
'We felt the time had come to change our policy, that the the circumstances
had changed and we should stir ourselves to pursue one of our objectives,
which was to promote trade,' Mr Hurd said.
Challenged by Lord Justice Scott on whether the decision amounted to the
government breaching its own guidelines, Mr Hurd said: 'It was certainly
pushing them to the limit.'
Mr Hurd unflinchingly defended the government's position. 'I would not
accept there was a deliberate bending of the rules or that there was a
conniving (by ministers and officials) in undermining a publicly stated
policy,' he said.
He argued that while shortcomings may have been identified by the inquiry,
the evidence was still 'light years from the suggestion made by the media
that ministers were secretly arming Iraq or indulging in some wicked
conspiracy'.
Mr Hurd also backed the decision of his junior minister, Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, to sign a public interest immunity certificate seeking to
prevent the disclosure of government documents during the Matrix Churchill
trial.
He said the decision had been wrongly interpreted by the media as an attempt
to save the government from embarrassment and deliberately designed to
'result in the conviction of people who were known to be innocent'.
The hearing continues today.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Dedicated follower of fashion: The trend away from full-time
employment paints a misleading picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sock Shop's decision to move most of its staff from full-time to part-time
contracts is part of an increasing trend in both the retail sector and the
economy as a whole.
It is also contributing to the rather misleading impression of buoyancy in
the jobs market. The net effect of Sock Shop replacing full-time staff with
part-time staff will be to increase the number of jobs in the economy, but
the number of hours worked will be static and might even fall.
Exactly the same effect was produced a year ago when Burton Group shed 2,000
full-time jobs and replaced them with about 3,000 part-time positions. Other
big retailers, such as BHS and the Allied Maples Group, have taken similar
steps and about a third of all retail staff are now estimated to be
part-timers.
Campaigners complain that this shift allows the government to claim that new
jobs are being created when in fact, adjusting for the increase in part-time
work, there is no net job creation at all.
Mr Paul Convery of the Unemployment Unit said: 'All that is happening is
that full-time jobs are being repackaged as less secure part-time jobs which
is actually bad for the economy as a whole in terms of consumer confidence.'
The figures do lend some support to this argument. According to the Labour
Force Survey - the most authoritative source on employment trends - there
was an overall increase of 67,000 in the number of people in work between
winter 1992-93 and summer 1993, from 21.18m to 21.25m.
But over the same period the number of full-time jobs fell by 38,000 and the
number of part-time jobs grew by 105,000.
Adjusting for the move to part-time working, the number of new 'full-time
equivalent' jobs was only just more than 3,000 - not 67,000. And over the
same period the average weekly hours worked fell from 36.4 to 36.3.
There are several incentives for employers to switch employees to part-time
working. It can create genuine increases in flexibility allowing more staff
in shops, for example, at busy times and fewer when they are not needed. It
can also be popular with some employees.
However, cost-saving is the crucial factor for most companies. Any employee
who works less than 15 hours per week, or earns less than Pounds 56, does
not have to be covered for National Insurance. As soon as that threshold is
reached, then National Insurance has to be paid on all the hours worked.
Any employee who works less than 16 hours per week does not qualify for
employment protection or for any statutory benefits such as redundancy pay
and maternity benefit. For these reasons the trend towards switching from
full-time to part-time work is likely to continue, and with it the
statistical impression that all is well in the labour market.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Labour steps up attack on 'bizarre' judicial reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday moved to exploit the government's embarrassment over its
troubled police and courts legislation by accusing Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, of trying to undermine the independence of the judicial system.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the bill would change fundamental
constitutional rights by increasing central government control of police
authorities and magistrates' courts, and abolishing the so-called right to
silence.
In a wide-ranging attack on government policy delivered in a speech at the
London School of Economics, Mr Blair confirmed that a future Labour
government would incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into
British law.
This would allow people to take cases direct to the European Court of Human
Rights rather than going through the UK courts and then waiting for the
European Court to hear an appeal.
He said the police and courts bill, which was widely criticised during its
second reading in the Lords, was a panicky reaction to the 'patent failure'
of the government's law-and-order policies.
'The Tory party is desperate and the dangers are plain. Policy is formulated
in panic, announced without thought and pushed through with only the next
day's headlines as a guiding principle,' he said.
Mr Blair said provisions allowing the home secretary to appoint five of 16
members of freshly constituted police authorities, including the chairman,
amounted to 'a dramatic change' to policing.
He said Mr Howard's plan to put magistrates' court clerks on fixed contracts
linked to performance criteria set by the Home Office had 'spread alarm and
despondency'.
Mr Blair also criticised plans in the criminal justice bill to require
judges to demonstrate the unwillingness of defendants to answer police
questions by calling them to the witness box.
He said the 'bizarre' proposals, which conflict with the recommendations of
the royal commission on criminal justice, would 'compromise the judiciary in
a wholly unacceptable way'. The provisions have also been criticised by Lord
Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice.
Mr Howard is expected to water down the police and courts bill by giving
police authorities the freedom to choose a chairman, and by strengthening
protection of the independence of magistrates' clerks. However, it is
unclear whether this will be enough to overcome the criticism, led by
prominent Tories including Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime minister.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Sock Shop curbs staff hours: Switch to part-time working
will affect up to 400 workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sock Shop, the sock and fashion retailer, is to move its 400 staff from
full-time to part-time contracts, adopting a growing trend in the retail
sector.
Managers of Sock Shop's outlets, of which there are nearly 100, were banned
yesterday from giving details of the change, but it is understood that most
full-time staff will be switched to 20 hours a week over three days.
One manager, who contacted the Financial Times by telephone, said the
company had made quite clear that the switch was mainly to save on
employment costs.
Ms Jenny Trotter, personnel manager, would not elaborate on a prepared
statement that read: 'Sock Shop Holdings Ltd is introducing a number of
changes to retail staff contracts. The main modification is in the area of
hours worked, so that we have a greater percentage of part-time workers in
the company. The changes are being introduced to secure a more flexible and
cost-effective workforce.'
The changes at Sock Shop are expected to affect about 400 people in nearly
100 shops. The company, built up by Ms Sophie Mirman in the 1980s, was sold
for Pounds 3.25m after it collapsed in 1990. It was bought by former
jeweller Mr Juan Olaso and venture capitalist Mr Barclay Douglas.
Staff at Sock Shop outlets in the City were yesterday unwilling to discuss
their employment prospects.
At one outlet an employee said he was already part-time and that suited him
well as he was a student. A driver supplying one outlet said he had worked
for Sock Shop for six years. It was a good employer, he said, but he did not
want to discuss the company.
Mr John Fahy of the shopworkers' union Usdaw said: 'Sadly, this is a growing
trend throughout the retail sector, and it is creating a lot of insecurity.
Employers are being encouraged by government employment legislation.'

The two sides are trying to come up with a new economic agenda in time for a
February 11 summit between President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime

The US official said he expected further intensive talks. But he made clear
it would be an uphill struggle to come up with market opening agreements on
cars, insurance and government procurement.

More British exporters have lost money as a result of payments delays by

Richard Lapper writes from London. In its latest report on the exports
outlook NCM said that one in four UK companies has been hit by bad payers
last year, compared with one in five in the 12 months to September 1993.
The figures show that the number of British companies exporting to Germany,
France, Spain and Italy and reporting a loss as a result of non-payment
increased. One exporter in 17 to Germany reported a loss (compared to one in
20 for the year to September 1993). One in 10 exporters to France, (one in

hit by non-payment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade between Japan and China rose by 31 per cent last year to Dollars
37.84bn making China Japan's second largest trading partner after the US for
the first time, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation.
The strong growth in trade between Japan and China shows a conspicuous
increase in economic activity between the two countries at a time when
Japan's overall trade with the rest of the world grew only 5 per cent, Jetro
said.
It highlights both the growth of the Chinese economy and the rising
sophistication of manufactured goods from China, which were up strongly last
year.
Jetro said that exports from Japan to China, which jumped 45 per cent to a
record Dollars 17.3bn, were supported by buoyant economic activity in China
which increased demand for capital goods.
The boom in construction activity, the rise in foreign investment in China
and growth in consumption by companies and government organisations alike
increased demand for machinery, equipment and cars.
Imports from China, meanwhile, were up 21 per cent to a record Dollars
20.6bn. While imports of textiles surged 30 per cent, those of machinery,
including audiovisual products such as video cassette recorders also rose a
firm 61 per cent and imports of office equipment increased by 213 per cent.
Jetro expects trade between the two countries to continue to increase this
year on the strength of growing foreign investment in China.
However, it warns that inflation, and concerns over a lack of foreign
reserves could slow the pace of increase in Japanese exports to China.
Meanwhile, imports from China are expected to continue growing on the
strength of firm Japanese corporate investment in that country.

<TEXT>
Forthcoming talks on the link between trade and environment policies in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will run into strong third world
resistance if they do not focus on poorer nations' concerns, Mr BK Zutshi,
India's Gatt ambassador, warned yesterday.
Mr Zutshi, outgoing chairman of the Gatt contracting parties (members), told
the world trade body's annual meeting in Geneva that talks had to embrace
the twin objectives of protecting the environment and promoting sustainable
development. More open trade, coupled with financial and technical
assistance, was essential to promote sustainable development.
For developing countries, 'poverty is the number one preoccupation. . . .
and the most important obstacle to better environmental protection', he
said. If, instead, the debate was reduced to polemics about 'greening the
Gatt' it would be an irrelevance for most members.
Giving the latest Gatt secretariat estimates for world trade growth, he said
it rose by less than 3 per cent by volume last year, against 4 per cent in
1992 despite a slight increase in world output to just above 2 per cent.

FT  26 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Australia-UK relations not just history -
Smaller but still perfectly formed trade links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's sunny shores have suddenly been swamped again by the British.
Prince Charles touched down in Sydney on Monday with a royal entourage and
40 journalists. Later this week, a trade delegation, led by Mr Michael
Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, flies into Melbourne,
accompanied by two other UK trade missions.
The British parties are being given a high-level reception. Mr Keating, with
his beaming but non-curtseying wife, turned out to greet Prince Charles, and
the Australian prime minister will deliver a keynote speech to a conference
on UK-Australian trade. This raises the question of whether such attention
is just residual politeness, or whether - from a commercial viewpoint, at
least - the countries still have something to offer each other.
On the trade front, the relationship has undergone some fundamental changes
in the past 30 years. Britain has thrown its lot in with Europe, while
Australia has cultivated its Asian neighbours. Between 1960 and 1990, the
latter's merchandise exports to western Europe shrank from 46 per cent of
the total to just 16 per cent. Today, about 60 per cent of Australia's trade
is conducted in the Asian region.
That said, the two countries' trade ties are not just history. Australia
sold ADollars 2.39bn (Pounds 1.1bn)-worth of goods to the UK in 1992/93, a
figure which has been increasing at a double-digit rate over the past five
years, thanks partly to the growing popularity of Australian wine. Britain
also remains the third most important source of imports into Australia and
the trade balance tilts well in the UK's favour. However, the five-year
trend in UK merchandise imports is flat.
The investment relationship is more interesting. According to a report by
the Allen Consulting Group, the UK is the second-largest investor in
Australia after the US and accounts for just less than a quarter of total
foreign direct investment there.
As Australian trade officials point out, the nature of that investment makes
it particularly valuable. About 44 per cent of it is in manufacturing. This
means that UK companies actually outstrip their US counterparts as players
in the core industrial sector.
It is tempting to think of this as an historical relic; after all, companies
such as Pilkington have had Australian subsidiaries for a century or more.
In reality, a smattering of recent deals - such as Tate &amp; Lyle's ADollars
325m purchase of Bundaberg Sugar, or United Biscuits' acquisition of Smiths
Snackfood - have sustained the UK's relative position, while the US share of
foreign investment in Australia has slipped and Japan's has grown.
The steady deregulation and privatisation of Australian industry has also
thrown up new opportunities which UK companies - in some cases recently
privatised themselves - have been prone to seize. BT's telecommunications
contract with the New South Wales government or British Airways' minority
stake in Quantas are cases in point.
From an Australian point-of-view, then, the British interest holds out the
possibility of new capital and, to some extent, new jobs. At a time when the
unemployment rate is in double-digits, Japanese investment is at low ebb and
the smaller south-east Asian countries have yet to show much interest in
placing their funds in Australia, this is welcome.
Arguments put forward by British trade officials for the continuing interest
in Australia are more subtle. They like to stress the possibility of using
the country as a route into the Asian markets, a thought which the
Australian trade lobby eagerly encourages.
'There's a comfort level,' says David Richard, senior trade commissioner at
Austrade. He cites the nations' similar legal systems, the availability of
professional services in Australia, the pleasant climate, and so on.
For British companies with existing operations in Australia, there is some
merit in this argument. The Allen report, for example, cites the experience
of P&amp;O (Australia), whose container handling, distribution, catering,
maritime and port management arms all have expanding interests in south-east
Asia.
But for companies seeking to set out a stall in Asia for the first time, the
merits of the Australian route are more debatable, and even British trade
officials admit it is a matter of 'horses for courses'. The downside is
that, while Sydney or Melbourne are within the 'Asian time zone', they still
face a three-hour time difference with most south-east Asian countries. A
flight between Sydney and Bangkok, say, takes eight hours.
Moreover, while Australia has been moving to reduce its tariff barriers,
restructure labour market practices, and shed its bureaucratic image, this
process is not complete.
Then there is investment by Australian companies in Britain. This has
increased sharply over the past decade, after the removal of exchange
controls, and amounted to about ADollars 15.9bn by the end of 1992. A large
tranche arrived in the late-1980s, when Australian 'entrepreneurs' were
riding high. Nevertheless, Australia's direct investment in Britain has
risen by a further ADollars 6.5bn over the past five years.
Few Australian companies have ventured into Europe without first securing a
British base - with the result that more than 70 per cent of Australian
investment in Europe is concentrated in the UK.
There are some signs that this is changing: for example, Amcor, the paper
group, began its European strategy by building a plant in Cambridgeshire,
and has subsequently expanded into France and Germany. But familiarity, it
seems, tends to work both ways.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Beijing warns over spending on new Hong Kong airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China last night moved to close off the option of Hong Kong proceeding to
build the colony's new airport without agreement when it said it would
abrogate any deal made without Beijing's consent, writes Simon Holberton in
Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government said the
post-1997 government would not be liable for any expenditure and debt
incurred in building the new airport. It also said any contract awarded
without Beijing's consent would be invalid after 1997.
The tone of the statement, rather than the specific threats, underlined the
low point to which Anglo-Chinese co-operation has sunk. The Hong Kong
government has consistently denied it would 'go it alone' on the
construction of the airport, and has always sought Chinese government
approval for any contract which spans 1997.
The statement seems to have been prompted by the Legislative Council's
approval of an extra HKDollars 1.6bn (Pounds 139m) of finance last week and
the government's decision to go to LegCo for a further HKDollars 4.6bn in
the coming week.
It emerged yesterday that Britain's approach to China last week for a
meeting of the Airport Committee - the governmental body set up to discuss
the project - got little response.
This was in spite of the implicit offer to put more of Hong Kong's money
into the HKDollars 160bn airport and related infrastructure development.
China last night said that the Hong Kong government's financial plan for the
airport and its connecting railway provided for HKDollars 45bn of debt. This
was nine times the HKDollars 5bn of government debt allowed for in a 1991
agreement, it said.

The government spokesman, Mr Seeiso Serutla, said yesterday the two sides
were selecting delegates and would meet the government for talks he expected
to extend over several days. The British Commonwealth yesterday said it had
sent two envoys to talk with the Lesotho government and military and

FT  26 JAN 94 / Algerian conference snub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Algeria's leading political parties yesterday boycotted the first day of a
conference for national reconciliation called by the country's High State
Council, writes Francis Ghiles.
The two-day meeting aims to end the violence which over the past two years
has claimed over 3,500 lives and is also set to approve a new collective
presidency to replace the body which has ruled Algeria since elections were
cancelled in January 1992.
The Islamic Salvation Front, which was poised to win the election, dismissed
the idea of dialogue with those who had 'stopped the electoral process and
spilt the blood of Moslem people'. The leader of the lay opposition party,
the Front des Forces Socialistes, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, said any head of
state appointed by the conference would have no legitimacy.

Australia's consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in the last quarter of
1993, for an annual rate of 1.9 per cent, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The figure was at the lower end of market expectations and prompted Mr Ralph
Willis, the treasurer, to concede that the government's budget forecast of a
3.5 per cent rise in prices in 1993-94 was 'considerably overstated'.

Oil companies in Nigeria estimate losses in production and equipment of
about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) last year through civil disruptions and
protests against loss of land, pollution and inadequate living conditions,
writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's quota of 1.8m barrels a day,
recorded 108 attacks or stoppages with the loss of 12m barrels in 1993. Agip
and Elf have reported smaller losses.
Nigeria's oil minister, Mr Don Etiebet, said at the weekend that the
government was considering tax concessions to the oil companies for
developing the local communities.
But this month's budget is not helping to encourage investment. The
introduction of a fixed rate of foreign exchange has doubled the cost of
bringing in capital.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between right-wing leaders, the South African government and the
African National Congress appeared to have broken down last night,
increasing chances the Inkatha Freedom party will boycott April's all-race
elections.
Talks are due to resume tomorrow, but negotiators from the government and
the ANC said privately they did not expect an agreement. They had hoped to
reach a compromise before the weekend, when an Inkatha party conference will
decide whether to participate in the poll. If the talks fail again tomorrow,
it is likely Inkatha's Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will try to persuade the
conference to boycott the elections.
Many senior Inkatha negotiators are believed to favour participation, but
Chief Buthelezi has said he would boycott the poll unless the constitution
is amended to strengthen regional powers. Last night's talks broke down over
this issue, with Inkatha insisting regions be granted 'exclusive' powers
which could not be overruled by central government, while the ANC wished to
maintain overriding powers for the centre in certain circumstances.
Inkatha and the white right wing Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's
Front) participated in the talks, with delegations from the ANC and
government. ANC and government officials left the door open to further
talks, even after the weekend. Mr Roelf Meyer, government chief negotiator,
said 'the process never stops'.
But once the Inkatha conference has taken a decision, it would be difficult
to reverse it; with only 90 days before the poll, the party loses valuable
campaigning time with any further delay.
Negotiators last night held out hope that separate talks with the white
right wing might still yield an agreement which would prevent conservative
Afrikaner parties from boycotting the poll. They said progress had been made
towards agreeing the Afrikaners' demand for a 'volkstaat', or homeland, with
the ANC agreeing in principle on a state with some autonomy.
The government will also pursue separate talks with the Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelithini on self-determination for the Zulu nation. Pretoria hopes to woo
the king with promises of protecting his salary and position under a new
constitution.
In exchange, he would endorse the elections against the wishes of Chief
Buthelezi. National party officials argue that an endorsement from the king
would significantly undermine an Inkatha boycott, as many Inkatha supporters
are conservative rural Zulus whose allegiance is to the Zulu monarchy.
Sources close to the king say a separate peace is unlikely. He has followed
the political lead of his uncle, Chief Buthelezi, since assuming the throne
and is unlikely to break decisively with him now.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Formal United Nations negotiations began yesterday on a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty, now supported in principle by all five declared
nuclear weapons states. The treaty, which could be ready in two to three
years, is seen by western governments as an important part of efforts to
prevent nuclear weapons proliferation after the Cold War.
The talks are being handled by an ad hoc committee of the UN Conference on
Disarmament, which has 37 members including the nuclear weapons states - the
US, Russia, China, Britain and France. On the first day of its session
yesterday, the conference gave the committee a formal mandate to 'negotiate
intensively' a universal and 'effectively verifiable' test ban treaty.
In a message to the conference, President Bill Clinton called for the
negotiation of a treaty 'at the earliest time'.
Mr John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said
yesterday a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) was 'an immediate priority'
for the US administration, which has made the fight against nuclear weapons
proliferation a central foreign policy concern. Non-nuclear weapons states
see the CTBT as a test of the nuclear powers' commitment to
non-proliferation and disarmament.
One reason for the US policy reversal on testing is the belief that a CTBT,
or progress towards one, will help persuade developing countries to extend
and strengthen the bedrock Non-Proliferation Treaty when it comes up for
renewal next year.
Separately, the US is opposing Iraq's admission to full membership of the UN
disarmament conference, though it says it will not oppose the inclusion of
North Korea.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese district court yesterday ordered a group of leading companies to
compensate residents for suffering caused by air pollution from factories.
The ruling comes after a 12-year wrangle since plaintiffs sued several
companies, including Tokyo Electric Power, NKK and Tonen, as well as the
state, for pollution from factories and car exhausts. The plaintiffs sought
Y2.6bn (Pounds 15.5m) damages and suspension of the emissions.
Of the 435 people who filed the suit in 1982, over 30 have since died. The
bureaucratic nature of Japan's courts and a lack of lawyers means it often
takes years to reach a verdict and a case can take 30 years to reach the
supreme courts.
The district court of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, ordered 12 companies to pay
Y463m in damages to local residents for diseases such as chronic asthma,
bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Mr Hisashi Nemoto, the presiding judge,
said the companies were responsible for air pollution in Kawasaki, known as
one of the most polluted districts in the country, and the factory emissions
containing sulphur dioxide were responsible for the illnesses.
Mr Nemoto rejected a request by residents to order tighter controls on
discharges of pollutants from the factories, saying the plaintiffs' claims
were too vague.
He also turned down claims that the state was responsible for the rise in
health problems due to the construction of roads.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Hosokawa to seek popular backing for political reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will today hold a
televised press conference calling for popular support for his plans to
reform the corruption-tainted political system.
This is an attempt to put pressure on a divided opposition Liberal
Democratic party to accept a compromise on the four political reform bills
before they expire at the end of the parliamentary session next Saturday.
There is widespread support for reform, between 50 per cent and 60 per cent
according to recent polls, indicating that Mr Hosokawa's address should
increase his already high popularity.
Last week his plans were voted down at the last parliamentary hurdle, the
upper house, by members of the two largest parties, the LDP and the Social
Democratic party - the largest coalition member - which both fear losing
seats under the proposed new system.
Officials from the seven-party coalition and the LDP yesterday agreed to ask
the lower house of parliament to agree to the formation of a panel to
discuss a compromise.
However, the panel has slim chance of striking a deal in time for parliament
to vote on it before the Saturday deadline. The LDP and Social Democrats are
too deeply split on reform to be able to take coherent positions.
If the panel fails to reach an accord, Mr Hosokawa has threatened to try to
override the upper house's rejection by putting the plans to a last-minute
vote in the lower house.
Support of two-thirds of the lower house is needed to overturn the upper
house, in what one political analyst dubbed the 'kamikaze option'.
Mr Hosokawa is unlikely to win such a vote, but it could encourage a fresh
round of defections from the LDP, thereby strengthening the coalition's
fragile majority.
The coalition is divided over what to do if, as is likely, Mr Hosokawa fails
to achieve reform by the weekend. Mr Hosokawa has hinted that he would
resign, leaving it to the coalition - possibly strengthened by LDP
defections - to form a new cabinet.
A close aide to Mr Hosokawa, Mr Shusei Tanaka, was yesterday reported as
saying that resignation was 'highly possible' as a result of the
difficulties facing the political reform bill. 'The prime minister is not
the type of person who seeks to cling to a position,' Mr Tanaka told Kyodo
News Service.
But some coalition leaders say Mr Hosokawa should stay in office regardless
of the fate of the reforms and work on stimulating Japan's sluggish economy.
'When we're in this severe a recession, it's not at all desirable to create
a (political) vacuum,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social
Democrats.
However, Mr Ichiro Ozawa's Japan Renewal party, the most influential
coalition partner, has suggested that a general election should be called.
Japanese press reports yesterday said Mr Ozawa has asked Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a
former LDP prime minister who supports reform, to defect to the coalition as
a possible successor to Mr Hosokawa.
Mr Kaifu is among the 70 LDP members of parliament who openly support
reform. But it is uncertain whether all LDP reformists would follow Mr
Kaifu, because he is not a powerful political fund-raiser, the vital
ingredient that Mr Ozawa provided when he led the LDP defection that brought
down the former LDP government last summer.
The business community views the prospect of a snap election with dismay,
because this would delay an urgently needed economic stimulus package and
threaten the government's finances when it is already late with the budget
for the fiscal year starting in April.
However, public distaste for the horse-trading over reform could manifest
itself as a protest vote against the LDP, if a snap election were called.
That would suit Mr Ozawa's strategy of further dividing and weakening the
LDP.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Kenya reaches Paris Club debt deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya has rescheduled Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) of debt arrears owed to the
Paris Club of creditor governments, sources close to the negotiations said
yesterday.
It is the first time Kenya has renegotiated the terms of its Dollars 8bn
external debt.
The deal was hammered out in Paris last week. Its immediate effect will be
to avert a looming balance of payments crisis, by spreading out the payment
of arrears over seven years with one year's grace.
Kenya began to fall behind on its debt servicing obligations when donor
governments, irked by corruption and mismanagement, suspended balance of
payments support in November 1991, worth about Dollars 40m a month.
Last November the World Bank and donor governments agreed to renew
assistance. The donor community pledged Dollars 850m in new aid to Kenya for
1994, in exchange for promises of further economic reform. Mr Musalia
Mudavadi, the finance minister, promised to deal with abusers of public
office.
The rescheduling agreement will limit Kenya's debt servicing bill to some
Dollars 240m in 1994, equal to about a quarter of its expected export
earnings.
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pleased with Kenya's
economic turnaround in the past six months. Mr Mudavadi's tight monetary
policy, and closure of scandal-tainted local banks, have tamed inflation
from 100 per cent to an annualised rate of 15 per cent in the final quarter
of 1993.
Ivory Coast yesterday signed a letter of intent with the IMF paving the way
for fresh funds to accompany devaluation of the CFA franc, Reuter reports
from Abidjan. The structural adjustment facility is worth Dollars 470m over
three years.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Saudis welcome Arafat coolly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, left Saudi
Arabia yesterday after a two-day visit which marked the first thaw in
relations between the two sides since the PLO support for Iraq in the Gulf
war.
Saudi anger at the PLO stance has not eased significantly since the
conclusion of the war and Mr Arafat's meeting with King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz
was described by one diplomat as 'correct but cool'.
The Saudis have demanded an apology from Arab states and organisations which
failed to rally to the support of the Gulf states following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. 'We cannot forgive, and we cannot forget,' said a senior
Saudi official recently. 'But there are two things in this world which you
cannot escape, and they are families and neighbours.'
It was always expected that at some time Mr Arafat, as part of the Arab
family, would again be received in Saudi Arabia. But officials have also
made clear that the PLO could not expect any further direct financial
support, one of the main objectives of his visit.
Saudi Arabia has agreed to provide an initial Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m)
for specific infrastructure projects in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West
Bank town of Jericho, following an Israeli withdrawal. Officials in Riyadh
stressed that its aid would be directed through international agencies and
closely monitored.
Support in Saudi Arabia for the September 13 declaration of principles by
Israel and the PLO was tempered both by its hostility to Mr Arafat
personally, and more generally by the belief that the Arab negotiators were
more likely to achieve a comprehensive peace by retaining a united front.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Japan price cuts anger drugs groups
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare has told domestic and overseas drugs
groups that prices of some medicines will be cut. The surprise cost-saving
move is in addition to regular price cuts implemented every two years and
previously announced price cuts on fast-selling medicines.
The ministry's decision, which has angered the pharmaceuticals industry, is
likely to undermine further the growth of Japan's drugs market, the world's
second most important. Foreign pharmaceuticals companies will today set out
their complaints at a meeting with the ministry.
Analysts had forecast that healthcare reforms and previously announced price
cuts would limit annual growth of Japan's pharmaceuticals market to between
zero and 3 per cent for the rest of the decade. Domestic groups will be hit
particularly by the new measures because of their dependence on the local
market.
Ministry officials are understood to have told Ono, the Japanese group, and
Roche Nippon, the subsidiary of the Swiss company, that prices of at least
one of their drugs would be cut because of their rapid sales growth.
The health ministry is under pressure from the finance ministry to contain
its spending after a sharp fall in tax receipts during the recession.
Pharmaceuticals represent about 28 per cent of Japan's health expenditure.
Ono's treatment for diabetic neuropathy, Kinedak, responsible for most of
the group's sales growth last year, is understood to have been targeted.
Nippon Roche said one of its successful anti-infective drugs was involved.
The group's wide spectrum antibiotic, Rocephin, has proved highly successful
since its recent launch.
Mr Hiroaki Shigeta, president of Nippon Roche, said: 'We're terribly upset
because of its lack of consistency. They keep changing the rules. It does
little to encourage innovation if every time you launch a successful product
it's hit by a special price cut.'
The Swiss company had already been hit by arbitrary price cuts late last
year when it was told the price of Roferon-A, its interferon product for
hepatitis C, would be reduced.
Other interferon makers, such as Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, Daiichi and
Yamanouchi, were also told of reductions then. The cuts for interferons are
expected to range from 13 to 20 per cent.
Makers of cholesterol-lowering products were told last year that prices
would be slashed. The drugs involved were Mevalotin - Japan's top-selling
medicine, made by Japan's second largest drugs company, Sankyo - and
Lipovas, a drug from Banyu, Merck's Japanese subsidiary. Their prices are
expected to be cut by about 12 per cent.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Stop promising heaven, Rafsanjani told: Domestic criticism
of economic policies is mounting as Iran suffers from weak oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani is facing mounting criticism
at home as the economy continues to suffer from weak international oil
prices.
Iran is dependent on oil for 85 per cent of its foreign exchange income and
it is estimated that every Dollars 1 fall in the international price of oil
results in a loss of Dollars 1bn in Iran's annual revenues.
President Rafsanjani recently attempted to play down the economic crisis by
saying that Iran could continue with its development programmes regardless
of oil prices.
But the bravado cannot mask the real economic problems the country faces.
Prices have mounted steeply since the government unified three different
exchange rates last March, leading to an effective devaluation from IR70 to
the dollar to IR1,400. The rial has subsequently fallen to more than IR2,000
to the dollar.
The English-language Kayhan International, complained that spiralling prices
were making the lives of many Iranians a misery. 'Galloping inflation, open
mismanagement of the economic sector, indifference towards the common
strata, decline in the international price of oil - all will get together to
make life intolerable and miserable for this nation of over 60m people,' it
wrote.
As subsidies to the poor are lifted, the import of luxury goods is being
seen as a symbol of skewed priorities and corruption. In a Friday prayers
sermon delivered in Qom last month, Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, speaker of the
assembly of experts, the body that elects the spiritual leader, said:
'Instead of promising heaven, the government should also be thinking about
solving this deadly inflation. But I know that this problem of high prices
will not be solved until those who have luxurious lifestyles. . . and who do
not feel social problems and who use their expertise to manage their own
affairs are no longer in power. And there are many of them.'
Jomhuri Eslami, a Tehran daily, chastised the government for promoting
International Monetary Fund-style measures of privatisation and reductions
in subsidies. It accused Mr Rafsanjani's economic team of being overawed or
deceived by liberal western economic theories and urged the government to
restore some state controls.
Trade has also suffered as a spending boom which began in 1990 has resulted
in Iran's formerly exemplary payments record being badly tarnished.
Until last summer, foreign exporters with Iranian letters of credit were
having to wait six months before receiving payment but the arrears have now
mounted to one year.
Estimates of the size of the total debt vary from Dollars 16bn up to Dollars
30bn. At least Dollars 8bn of this is estimated to be in arrears and is
costing the country about Dollars 3bn a year to service. The Dollars 30bn
figure would include letters of credit which have been opened but which will
be abandoned by exporters unable to find export cover.
'There is a serious problem,' said one European banker. 'But at the same
time Iran's debt load is manageable because it is almost all short-term.'
The most exposed countries are Iran's main trading partners, Germany and
Japan.
Imports have been cut, aided by the refusal of foreign banks to confirm
Iranian letters of credit and by the country being in effect off-cover for
most export credit agencies. Under these circumstances, foreign investment,
which Mr Rafsanjani has sought for a number of years, remains only a
possibility.
Attempts at rescheduling the debt over the medium-term have not yet met with
success both for practical reasons but also because of Iran's poor
international image. The US has put Iran back on its list of favourite enemy
nations and Iran has done little to help itself by failing to lift the death
sentence imposed on British writer Salman Rushdie.
'The sentiment in Europe is somewhere between regret and frustration,' said
one banker. 'Iran has not had a bad name in trade circles in the past but
the Iranians do everything to make it difficult to love them.'
Mr Rafsanjani has quashed suggestions that Iran's second five-year
development plan, due to begin at the start of the Iranian year on March 21,
should be postponed.
The plan which is due to take over where the first five-year plan leaves
off, assumes an annual average income of Dollars 15.5bn from oil, but the
price of Iranian oil has dropped to less than Dollars 12 a barrel. This year
Iran will be lucky to earn Dollars 14bn, compared with official projections
of Dollars 17bn.
The second plan is aimed at extending the government's privatisation
campaign, reducing subsidies, authorising the government to seek Dollars
2.4bn in long-term loans for the construction of four dams, as well as
seeking foreign investment in the form of joint ventures.
Nevertheless there are many government officials who share the view of Mr
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the speaker of the Iranian majlis (parliament), who
said last month that the legislature wanted to postpone the start of the
five-year plan for a year 'because one cannot study a plan in a crisis'.

Iran's president said yesterday economic co-operation between the 10 Islamic
members of the Economic Co-operation Organisation in the Middle East and
central Asia could reduce political tensions affecting them, Reuter reports
from Tehran.
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was opening a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the 10 states that include Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan and
six former Soviet republics.
ECO was founded by neighbours Turkey, Iran and Pakistan in the 1950s as a
regional trading bloc but was largely dormant until it was expanded two
years ago to become the largest non- Arab Islamic organisation stretching
from Europe to China.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Mexican rebels set peace conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rebels in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas have set out conditions for
ending their armed struggle, proposing that any negotiations focus on the
plight of the state's indigenous peoples.
In a communique sent to Mexican newspapers, the rebels laid down their most
conciliatory agenda for talks so far. They said they had neither the desire
nor the ability to take their struggle to all Mexicans. They also agreed to
free Mr Absalon Castellanos, the former Chiapas governor, held captive since
the new year.
The communique appears to be part of a campaign to win public sympathy in
the self-styled Zapatista Army of National Liberation's war of public
relations with the government. While the government has said all avenues of
negotiation are open, part of its strategy has been to isolate the guerrilla
leaders from their followers by promising money and social reform to the
state's impoverished indigenous communities.
The rebels' conciliatory proposals were immediately welcomed by Mr Manuel
Camacho, the peace envoy in Chiapas, who said the possibility of dialogue
was coming closer.
President Carlos Salinas, in his first trip to Chiapas since the new year
uprising, yesterday said he would offer 'profound and structural' solutions
to the problems in the state.
The Zapatistas said talks would have to address the economic plight of
indigenous peoples, discrimination, a ceasefire and an end to violence in
the region. So far there has been no reported contact between either side.
Mr Camacho has indicated a willingness to discuss all the rebel demands, but
it is not clear how much support he enjoys from President Salinas.
Mr Camacho said on Sunday that the search for peace had been hindered by 'a
wave of interpretations' about the political consequences of his actions in
Chiapas.
He was referring to reports that members of the government were opposing his
peace mission, fearful that Mr Camacho might launch himself as a candidate
for the presidency, either from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party
or an independent party.
Mr Camacho then fuelled such speculation with veiled criticism of the
government's political and social policy. He also declined several
opportunities to say he would not be a candidate.
Amnesty International yesterday accused Mexico's security forces of using
torture and arbitrary arrests in its efforts to quell the revolt, Reuter
reports.
The organisation said a team that visited the state between January 18 and
22 received information about dozens of torture cases, at least nine
extra-judicial executions, 15 other suspicious killings and scores of
arbitrary detentions.

FT  26 JAN 94 / British offer over Falklands oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government has indicated its readiness to allow Argentine
companies to take part in the development of oilfields in the Falkland
islands' territorial waters - provided they acknowledge that any oil
extracted belongs to Britain.
Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine interests will end up
operating installations on the islands themselves, but believe Argentina's
coast could be a logical site for support operations.
Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year around the
Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 per cent
larger than the North Sea.
The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent request from Buenos
Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to discuss joint
development of oil resources. London has yet to agree to this meeting.
Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next important policy
objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms that implicitly recognise
Britain's sovereignty over the islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks
on fish to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas
reserves. British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore
exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's state-owned
oil company.
Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that rapprochement with
Argentina would probably be necessary if an oil industry were to be
developed.
Recent developments come against a background of steadily improving
relations between the two former belligerents.
A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the first UK cabinet
minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland islands conflict.
Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr
Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited Britain.

<TEXT>
The Clinton administration will ask Congress for Dollars 6.6bn in emergency
funds to help California recover from last week's earthquake, on top of the
Dollars 900m it has already released, bringing the total to Dollars 7.5bn.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said yesterday that a bill would be
sent to Congress today asking for Dollars 3.9bn for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, Dollars 1.4bn for road repairs and Dollars 1.3bn for
emergency loans to small businesses; the final bill could climb higher, he
said.
Members of Congress representing the battered state said they hoped the
measure could be passed by mid-February, but controversy could still arise
over whether the emergency money should be treated outside normal federal
budget ceilings or be offset by other spending cuts.
Although emergency spending for natural disasters such as hurricanes and
earthquakes is usually handled outside the constraints of the budget
ceilings, last summer both Democrats and Republicans held up aid for the
Mississippi and Missouri floods over this issue.
More than 1,000 buildings have been declared unsafe as a result of the
earthquake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and killed 57 people.
Los Angeles will also have to rebuild some of its biggest roads.
Because of the urgency the Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled an
order preventing California from receiving about Dollars 800m in federal
road construction funds in a dispute over the state's smog control measures.

FT  26 JAN 94 / De Leon awaits verdict of Guatemalan people: Sunday's
referendum is a political litmus test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon Carpio is hoping to get his presidency
back on track with a crucial referendum on Sunday on constitutional reform.
A defeat would further undermine his weak government.
The vote has become increasingly a gauge of confidence in the president
rather than a judgment on the substance of the reforms, which are a mystery
to most citizens.
'What he stands to win is not very much,' says Mr Gabriel Aguilera, a
political analyst. 'But what he could lose is considerable.'
When Mr de Leon was unexpectedly named president in June last year,
Guatemalans hoped the former human rights ombudsman would break the mould of
a society dominated by the army and ill-served by political institutions.
He took over amid high expectations - and with no party or programme - after
being elected by Congress following President Jorge Serrano's failure to
grab powers in a coup attempt in May.
As human rights ombudsman he was a strong opponent of the army and a vocal
critic of civilian militias known as civil defence patrols, which the armed
forces forcibly recruit as part of their counter-insurgency strategy. Since
becoming president, however, he has repeated the military's view that the
500,000 patrol members will not be disbanded until the country's 33-year-old
civil war has ended.
'The supposed great executioner of the army has turned out to be the best
administrator of its policies,' says Mr Jose Luis Chea, leader of the
centrist Democratic Union party, not represented in Congress. Human rights
abuses, particularly death threats and kidnappings, have increased since he
took office, says Mr Fernando Lopez, director of the human rights office of
the archbishop of Guatemala City. 'But for there to be a real decrease in
abuses, first there must be an end to the armed conflict.'
After several false starts, the government and the left-wing guerrillas of
the National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity held preliminary talks this
month aimed at ending the war, the first official contact since May.
But there is little evidence that the two sides will avoid the same obstacle
 -on apportioning blame for human rights abuses during the conflict - which
resulted in deadlock when they met last year.
On the political front, many of Mr de Leon's problems arise from his failure
to force the resignation of supreme court judges, and a divided and
discredited Congress.
'By wrapping himself in the banner of the purge (of Congress), he became the
principal focus of Congress's attack, and succeeded in unifying it against
him,' says Mr Eduardo Mazariegos, a political analyst at Asies, a local
think-tank.
The result was a compromise constitutional reform package in November, on
which Guatemalans vote on Sunday. It includes greater accountability and
decentralisation of government spending, de-politicisation of the supreme
court, and a pledge that deputies will resign by mid-1994.
But while the agreement probably averted another political crisis, critics
have condemned it as a fudge, cooked up by the political elite. Mr Miguel
Angel Albizurez, who advises civil organisations which he says played no
part in formulating the proposed changes, describes the agreement as 'an
insult to the people, which Ramiro will pay for politically'.
On the economic front the government may also be heading for problems.
Guatemala last month signed an agreement with the IMF which will require
tighter fiscal policies and pressure to remove subsidies for state
utilities.
And while Mr de Leon seems to be keeping his promise to focus on poverty
reduction, even this may prove politically costly. Several social funds
directed at improving conditions in rural areas have started operating
recently, and will be the focus of much state investment this year.
However, senior officials admit that diverting resources to more needy rural
areas has a price. Opposition to government is organised in the cities;
exactly the reason why the countryside has been neglected for so long.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Consumer confidence underpins US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumers' growing confidence is likely to underpin robust economic
growth this year, figures yesterday indicated.
The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence rose 3.4 points
to 83.2 in January. The index has risen 23 points since October, reflecting
growth in the fourth quarter at an estimated annual rate of 6 per cent.
Gross domestic product in the opening quarter will be distorted by arctic
weather and the Los Angeles earthquake, but most forecasters believe the
underlying growth rate is 3 per cent or slightly higher.
In a separate report yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said
sales of existing homes rose 6.7 per cent last month and by 11.1 per cent in
the year to December. In 1993 as a whole, 3.8m previously-owned homes were
sold, the highest level since 1979.
The recovery appears to be putting little pressure on wage costs. The Labour
Department yesterday said the employment cost index - which includes wages
and fringe benefits - rose 0.8 per cent in the final quarter last year, the
same rate as in the third period. Wage and benefit increases averaged 3.5
per cent in the 12 months to December, matching the previous year.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the confidence figures
reflected the increasing strength of the recovery. However, he noted an
undercurrent of uncertainty about employment.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Balladur plans job creation package
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is expected on Sunday to announce modest job-creating
measures to boost the country's fragile economic recovery.
The package may include tax incentives to create jobs in services to
compensate for those still lost in industry.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has said reversing the climbing
jobless rate is his highest priority. But evidence of uneven industrial
production and lacklustre consumer spending towards the end of last year
have shaken government confidence in the strength and durability of the
recovery.
President Francois Mitterrand is sniping at the conservative premier for
doing too little to create jobs and too much to cut welfare benefits.
Mr Balladur's room for manoeuvre is limited. He has handed monetary policy
to the newly independent Bank of France which is likely to see what Sunday's
announcement contains before making any change in interest rates.
Mr Balladur still has the tool of fiscal policy, but is caught between his
promise not to raise any taxes this year and his commitment to reducing the
budget deficit.
The government is considering linking repayments to companies of value added
tax (which is refunded to companies on their exports outside the European
Union) to job creation. French employers have already bridled at any such
restriction on their VAT refunds, which they regard as a right, not a
favour. Another possible measure might be to give chain stores and petrol
stations tax incentives to rehire the service staff they have laid off in
recent years.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Labour conflict in Germany's vital engineering industry loomed yesterday
when wage negotiations ended in deadlock in two key regions.
Union negotiators warned that 'massive' token strikes were likely from next
Monday, after the engineering employers refused to move from their
insistence on a wage freeze, and a reduction in holiday entitlements for the
3.4m members of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union.
The fourth round of talks between the union and Gesamtmetall, the employers'
federation, ended without movement on either side in both North
Rhine-Westphalia, with 950,000 workers involved, and northern
Baden-Wurttemberg, where the negotiations cover 750,000.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union leader, warned that his members were gearing up
for a 'major social conflict' in the light of the employers' refusal to
compromise on their demands.
At a national conference of the opposition Social Democratic party in Bonn,
he appealed for support to counter what he described as the 'catastrophic
course' of the engineering employers, who have called for cost cuts of up to
10 per cent from the current wage round.
The employers, however, are expressing much greater confidence that a deal
will be agreed without an all-out strike.
Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the president of the German chambers of trade and
industry (DIHT) and former engineering industry negotiator, said he did not
believe either side was prepared for such a conflict. He predicted a
'relatively extended wage round' before a conclusion was reached.
The union is seeking wage rises of between 5.5 and 6.0 per cent in the
different negotiating regions, to compensate for inflation and claimed
increases in productivity. In contrast, the employers say that with job
losses in the industry running at around 30,000 a month over the past year,
real cost cuts are essential.
Mr Zwickel appeared to moderate his position yesterday, when he said the
union had made job security its highest priority. At the start of
negotiations, he said that both job security, and the maintenance of real
income levels, were of equal priority.
Both sides are obliged to negotiate without strikes or lock-outs only until
Friday this week, which is why a campaign of token strikes is expected from
next week.
However, if neither side formally declares the negotiations failed, the
existing wage levels, and the existing package of holiday bonuses, will
remain intact.

<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin will today try to persuade Mr Boris Fyodorov,
leading Russian reformer, to stay on as finance minister, amid continuing
concern about the future of market reforms.
Mr Yeltsin and Mr Fyodorov will discuss conditions on which he would stay in
office in an attempt to shore up confidence in Russia's turbulent reform
process.
Mr Fyodorov, the mainstay of economic reform, said last week he was quitting
because two key policy opponents had not been sacked and because Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, planned 'non-monetary' methods to fight
inflation.
He has also called for the removal of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central
bank chairman, who believes that tough monetary and fiscal policies are not
what Russia needs. Mr Fyodorov has made no secret of his desire to take over
the central bank, but such a move would never be endorsed by parliament.
Both Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Yeltsin, who endorsed the initial cabinet
line-up which provoked Mr Fyodorov's resignation threat, appear to have been
caught unawares by the international outcry it provoked.
Western diplomats yesterday confirmed there were back-stage pleas from the
west for Mr Fyodorov to be kept on.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain yesterday sent the markets soaring and bolstered the
peseta with a surprise quarter-point rate cut that brought the benchmark
intervention rate down to 8.75 per cent, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The cut
came as unions planned to bring the country to a standstill in a 24-hour
general strike tomorrow.
The move apparently reflected confidence by the monetary authorities that
domestic recession has bottomed out, that headline inflation, which stood at
4.9 per cent last month, will fall to 3.5 per cent later this year and that
currency turmoils are unlikely in coming months.
The Madrid Bolsa index, which has been gaining in the past months, rose to a
record 343.81 high before easing to close at 342.94, up from 339.01 on
Monday. The peseta, under pressure following the Banesto bank crisis, had by
late afternoon strengthened to Pta80.93 to the D-Mark.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Lira crisis leaves Ciller's policies in tatters: How the
collapse of the Turkish currency has undermined the PM's low interest rate
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's currency crisis intensified yesterday as the lira slipped further
on the foreign exchanges. It fell to 17,900 to the US dollar, a drop of 4
per cent since Monday's close.
Yesterday's fall followed a run on the currency last week and was another
rebuff to the government of Mrs Tansu Ciller.
Since she came to office last summer, Mrs Ciller has been driven by an
unorthodox belief that lower interest rates were the cure for the country's
ills. Lower rates, she argued, would result in lower debt servicing costs, a
lower budget deficit and thus lower inflation.
The policy is today in tatters with the central bank having been forced to
raise inter-bank rates, as high as 200 per cent at one point, to restore
confidence in the lira.
The initial trigger for currency crisis that began last week was the
announcement that US rating agencies - Moodys and Standard &amp; Poor's - were
downgrading Turkey's credit rating.
Seeking a rating was always going to be a double-edged sword. It presupposed
that Turkey would, if not improve on, at least maintain its current economic
performance. That has not happened. Turkey's public finances are in a
shambles. Privatisation has been blocked by political and legal wrangling.
The public sector deficit is expected to have been about 16 per cent of
gross national product in 1993. The target for 1994, at 14 per cent, is
hardly more encouraging.
For Mrs Ciller and her technocrats the whole episode has been a salutary
reminder that after a decade of reform, the Turkish economy is that much
more vulnerable to policy error. A faster depreciation of the lira may help
the trade account, by making exports more competitive. But the resulting
increase in import costs will fuel inflation. Turkey is in the midst of an
import-led consumer boom, with the economy growing by close to 8 per cent in
1993. As a result the deficit on the current account for 1993 reached close
to Dollars 5bn and is officially projected at Dollars 4.4bn in the current
year.
It is against such a fragile background that the currency crisis has
occurred. Heavy central bank advances to the Treasury coupled with the
recent salary pay-out to civil servants created an excess of lira in the
market last week. Traders also reported tight supplies of foreign exchange
when tourist receipts and workers remittances traditionally slow down.
Another contributing factor is that many Turks now choose to keep their
savings in hard currency accounts, a measure of just how far Turkey's 70 per
cent inflation rate has taken its toll. In the end, what might have started
as a minor shake, became a full-scale currency quake. The immediate fall-out
is hard to gauge. The international banks that lend to Turkey will be
looking for reassurances that it can continue to service its foreign debt.
After record borrowings in 1993, Turkey's external public and private debt,
already Dollars 59bn by the end of September, is estimated to have reached
Treasury, needing at least Dollars 2bn just to refinance existing debt, is
expected to seek an early return to the Samurai market, the Japanese bond
market for foreign issuers, perhaps next month, in order to re-establish its
presence in the market.
Paradoxically, the foray into international debt markets had been one of the
successes of 1993, with the Treasury skilfully tapping the international
appetite for Turkish paper. As one Japanese banker put it, 'Turkey is a
little like Yugoslavia used to be - high risk, offering a good yield, and
(on top of that it is) an OECD member.'
Moreover the availability of foreign debt enabled the government to
restructure its domestic borrowings. It managed to reduce the amounts
borrowed as well as extending the maturities.
One western economist estimated that Turkey may have saved as much as
Dollars 1bn in 1993 by shifting its domestic borrowing strategy from
short-term to longer-term issues.
For this reason, Moody's and S&amp;P's decision is that much more critical.
In the short term, the higher than projected domestic interest rates will
add to the budget deficit. Higher borrowing costs will stifle private sector
investment at a time when Turkish firms need to prepare themselves for the
competition which will follow on Turkey's completion of a customs union with
the European Union, now set for 1995. The central bank has so far declined
to issue any instruction to the private banks.
However, some economists believe another, perhaps more dramatic, one-way
currency movement could precipitate a full-scale foreign exchange crisis.
They point out the banking sector's overall short position - the difference
between banks' foreign exchange liabilities and domestic lira assets - is
close to Dollars 6bn.
In the end, what happens will depend as much on political as economic
developments with all the parties now eyeing the outcome of the forthcoming
municipal elections.
And as one Turkish observer pointed out, the recent interest rate rise will
have been particularly severe for the small traders and artisans, who
traditionally have supported Mrs Ciller's True Path party DYP.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Gonzalez set to face down unions: Tomorrow's general strike
in Spain will expose union weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain is approaching its third general strike in six years tomorrow with a
mixture of apathy and detachment that is sorely testing the political muscle
of the country's two main trades unions.
The strike is in protest at labour market reforms being introduced by the
government.
While it seems likely that transport and industry will be badly hit, and
that pickets will stop many going to work, strong parliamentary support for
the reforms has muted normally vociferously anti-government newspapers.
The two union leaders, Mr Nicolas Redondo of the socialist General Workers'
Union and Mr Antonio Gutierrez of the communist Workers' Commissions, in
trying to drum up support for the strike have insisted that the imposition
of reforms without adequate negotiation had left them with little choice but
to strike.
To an extent, that is true. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, making full use
of the country's downcast economic mood, has directly challenged the role in
policy-making that union leaders have claimed for themselves since Spain's
relaunch as a democracy in 1978. The reforms, designed to help Spain claw
its way out of recession, will make it easier and cheaper for employers to
hire and fire workers, tax unemployment benefits, and introduce what the
unions call 'junk jobs' - apprenticeships paid below the minimum wage.
Mr Gonzalez put a time limit on talks about the reforms with unions and
employers last November and quickly pressed ahead with them after the
deadline expired. He had earlier angered the unions, partly in an effort to
mollify currency market scepticism about the strength of the peseta, by
declaring that he would impose the reforms whether he had union agreement or
not.
While the government was shaken into increasing social security spending
after a general strike in December 1988, ministers this time are declaring
loudly that tomorrow's strike, even if it succeeds in closing down the
country, will not alter policy.
That remains to be seen. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for the
unions to claim widespread work stoppages during these strikes as a measure
of support for the aims of the strike. Spain is easy to close down -
especially by hitting transport - but it seems certain that many Spaniards
will simply take the day off, fearful of pickets or simply the difficulty of
struggling into work on commuter lines. A half-day general strike in protest
at unemployment benefit cuts in 1992 is generally considered to have failed.
The unions had hoped to spend most of January building support for the
strike but have had the wind taken out of their sails by two events: the
Banesto bank crisis, which brought home the depth of the recession to many
Spaniards, and the collapse of a union-owned housing co-operative, which has
led to protests against the General Workers' Union. in
For Mr Redondo the PSV debacle and the prospect of a lukewarm strike
tomorrow are serious blows. He is due to retire this spring and many
analysts believe that when he goes, the nature of the intercourse between
the unions and any government in Madrid will change, with unions
concentrating less on regaining their lost political influence and more on
their relations with employers.
It was Mr Redondo who, in 1974, proposed the young Felipe Gonzalez as leader
of the then exiled socialist party at a national congress held on the
outskirts of Paris.
Then, and until five years ago, the General Workers' Union was an appendage
of the socialist party.
But as his protege has moved steadily towards the political centre, the
friendship and the institutional links have expired.
Many of the political battles fought by the unions with the Socialist party
since they first came to power in 1982 have born the stamp of a personal war
by Mr Redondo against Mr Gonzalez.
His departure from the union will leave his younger Workers' Commission
colleague, Mr Gutierrez, as the unchallenged authority in Spanish trade
unionism. Pragmatic, clever and middle class, Mr Gutierrez is a much cooler
customer, less ambitious for the political limelight and easier in the
company of corporate bosses. Ministers believe he will have already written
off tomorrow's strike as too late to stop the reforms.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Bonn agrees Telekom and post sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The way has been cleared for the privatisation of Germany's telecoms and
postal services after the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior party in
the Bonn coalition, abandoned demands that the postal monopoly should be
broken up for the sale.
The privatisation bill for Deutsche Telekom, the national telecoms operator,
the German postal services and the Postbank, now has the formal backing of
all German parties, including the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). The SPD
votes are needed for the bill to pass through parliament. A first reading is
scheduled for next week.
The Free Democrats had earlier insisted that the privatisation bill should
specify when the monopolies of the postal services and of the telephone
infrastructure would end. However, the bill will specify that Deutsche
Telekom will lose its monopoly only on telephone voice services on January
1, 1998, to comply with a European Union decision to liberalise voice
telephony by this date. There will be no other reference to the status of
the monopolies in the bill.
The SPD has fiercely opposed the break-up of the loss-making postal services
mainly because of worries about job losses. The FDP, however, had argued
that competition should be introduced across the sector, implying the
stripping out of some of the profitable areas such as freight. The
government is hoping the bill will be adopted by the summer so that the law
could come into force at the beginning of 1995. This would in turn allow
Deutsche Telekom to raise much-needed cash for investment and to reduce its
DM100bn (Pounds 38bn) debt by selling a first tranche of shares in 1996.
However, the liberals and the dominant Christian Democrats (CDU) seem to
have reached an informal agreement for the partial liberalisation of the
postal monopoly at a later date. Mr Rainer Funke, state secretary in the
justice ministry and liberal MP responsible for the privatisation bill, said
that Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post and telecoms minister, could decide
independently to liberalise postal services other than regular mail.
A letter by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Quelle, Germany's largest mail-order
company, promising that the post monopoly will be broken, has already sent
shock waves through the German post agency.
A committee of independent experts is now studying the feasibility of
introducing competition in the postal services for packages, express mail
and other services other than regular letters. The German postal service has
warned that such a move would result in a yearly loss of DM3.4bn. But
sources in the post ministry say the post would only lose DM500m.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Car dealers may keep special terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carmakers may be able to retain exclusive distribution networks after 1995,
Mr Martin Bangemann, the Industry Commissioner, indicated yesterday.
Exclusive distribution networks are against EU competition rules, but the
motor industry was given a ten-year exemption in 1985.
The industry had argued that the complexity and safety implications of
vehicles required dedicated dealers who had to invest heavily in order to
repair and maintain vehicles adequately.
The industry has become anxious that friction over car pricing within the EU
might lead to the exemption not being renewed after 1995.
Mr Bangemann said yesterday he will propose an extension of the exemption in
a report he is drafting on the competitiveness of the motor industry.
However, carmakers might be required to make further progress towards price
harmonisation as part of Mr Bangemann's proposals.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Portugal hit by strike standstill
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 24-hour national strike by Portuguese public-sector workers yesterday
seriously disrupted hospitals, schools, courts, public transport and other
services. Unions said the action was backed by up to 90 per cent of workers
concerned.
The strike was in protest against a proposal by the centre-right social
democrat government to limit 1994 pay rises in the public administrative
sector to 2 per cent. Unions are demanding a 9 per cent increase. The strike
was the first to be jointly backed by both the communist-led
CGTP-Intersindical and socialist-dominated UGT union confederations.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, has made clear that his
government aims to set an example for private-sector employers by keeping
pay rises low. This follows the collapse of efforts to negotiate a national
wage pact between unions and employers.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Commission is split on steel tubes venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is divided over whether to block a three-way
European joint venture in the steel tubes sector on competition grounds.
Commissioners are due to decide on the deal, which involves French, German
and Italian companies, at their meeting today.
It is probably the most difficult competition decision they have faced for
more than a year and officials said yesterday it was impossible to predict
which way a vote would go.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, has proposed outlawing the
joint venture between Vallourec, a French steel tubing company, and
subsidiaries of Mannesmann of Germany and Ilva of Italy.
If a majority of the 17 commissioners supports Mr Van Miert's proposal, it
will be only the second time the EU's 1990 merger regulation has been used
to block a deal outright. The Commission has reached the four-month deadline
for a decision on the case. Under merger rules, the deal will go ahead if no
decision is taken.
The Commission's merger task force opposes the deal because it believes it
would create an anti-competitive 'duopoly' in the sector, with the joint
venture and Sandvik, the Swedish engineering group, accounting for nearly 70
per cent of the European Union market.
But some commissioners believe the alliance should be encouraged as the best
means of competing with potential rivals in Japan and eastern Europe.
If Mr Van Miert's proposal is approved it will set a precedent in European
competition law, by endorsing the principle that a duopoly can exist, even
if there are no structural links between the companies involved.
The two French, two Italian and two German commissioners are expected to
reject Mr Van Miert's proposal, backed by the Luxembourg commissioner.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Clinton vows to press ahead with welfare reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night vowed to 'continue the journey of renewal'
in the reform of the US domestic infrastructure, making clear he would press
ahead with both healthcare and welfare changes this year.
In his first formal State of the Union address, he also said he would send
Congress next month one of the toughest budgets in recent memory with tight
caps on spending.
The president squashed speculation that he would not propose significant
changes to the welfare system this year so as to clear the decks in Congress
for the overriding priority of healthcare reform. It was, he said,
'inevitable and imperative' that both be tackled at the same time.
But White House aides stressed that the welfare proposals would not be
revealed until the spring when it is hoped healthcare will have passed some
initial congressional hurdles.
Nevertheless, the president explicitly linked the two. 'Until we solve the
healthcare problem, we will not solve the welfare problem,' he said.
Addressing criticism in Congress and in parts of the medical and insurance
professions, he emphasised that his healthcare plan guaranteed the provision
of private, not state, insurance.
But he also insisted that an improving economy did not mean that an overhaul
of the healthcare system could be ducked. Without it, he said, Americans
would be faced with 'less care, fewer choices and higher bills'.
His renewed commitment to welfare reform must be seen as a concession to the
criticism of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who is
also chairman of the Senate finance committee and who has threatened to make
trouble for healthcare if welfare were put on the back burner.
State of the Union messages always have much symbolism and this was present
last night. In the House gallery Mrs Hillary Clinton was seated next to Mr
Lane Kirkland, the union leader, and Mr Jack Smith, chairman of General
Motors. Mr Clinton opened his speech with a tribute to Mr Tip O'Neill, the
former House Speaker, who died recently, and then applauded Mr James Brady,
the former Reagan press secretary who has lobbied for a gun control bill
that became law last November.
He made much of the economic recovery, particularly the projected reduction
to Dollars 180bn in the upcoming fiscal year of a federal budget deficit
estimated when he took office to remain in the Dollars 300bn range. Mr
Clinton said: 'We should be proud of the early results but everyone should
acknowledge there is more to do.' For this reason he intended to pursue
tight spending ceilings in next month's budget.
Mr Clinton endorsed a number of measures designed to attack the crime wave,
which is the dominant national concern according to opinion polls. These
include a bill putting 100,000 more policemen on the streets and the
establishment of quasi-military 'boot camps' for young non-violent
offenders.
In a similar vein, designed to appeal to the conservative element in
Congress, he said next month's budget 'draws the line against further
defence cuts and fully protects the readiness and quality of our forces'.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Plan to abolish EU passport controls hit by further delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers in continental Europe will not be able to cross borders without
passports from next month as planned, nine European Union countries decided
yesterday.
The nine members of the Schengen free-travel accord abandoned attempts to
set a deadline for the abolition of passport controls, amid mutual
recriminations about who was to blame for the latest and most serious delay.
Senior officials from the Schengen group of countries - all 12 EU members
except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - agreed yesterday their governments
would not be able to meet the most recent target date of February 1 for
ending passport controls.
They refused to set another deadline, as they could not predict when the
Schengen zone's computer system - which is supposed to link up immigration
and police authorities - would be running efficiently enough to replace
border surveillance. No solution is thought likely before the second half of
the year.
Sema, the Anglo-French computing services group, angrily dismissed claims
that the Strasbourg-based central computer was to blame for the delay. Sema
accused national governments of not bringing their computer systems into
line. A consortium of Sema, the French computer group Bull, and
Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany has been working on Schengen's central system.
Members of the Schengen accord - named after the Luxembourg village where it
was signed - originally intended to beat the EU's deadline of January 1 1993
for abolishing all controls at internal land, sea and airport frontiers.
Since then, they have missed three further deadlines.
Yesterday's decision leaves the EU's ambition to end internal passport
controls in shreds. The European Commission has pledged to enforce what it
says is a legal obligation for all EU countries to lift controls, and faces
legal action from the European Parliament for its alleged failure to press
member states.
Agence France Presse reported yesterday that Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, state
secretary at the German chancellery, had blamed Sema itself for failing to
sort out system software problems. Germany chairs the Schengen group until
the end of June. Sema officials said the central computer had been ready for
testing on September 15, but some national systems were unprepared.
Schengen officials in Brussels said yesterday they expected to be ready to
take a decision on passport controls 'at the end of the German presidency'
of the Schengen group in June, but they stressed this was not a deadline.
Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas) is setting up a telephone 'hotline' next
week to field border control complaints.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Major hints at softer line over public sector pay: Prime
minister denies deception as Labour presses tax attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major drew back from a confrontation with key groups of
public-sector workers yesterday by signalling that efficiency savings would
allow them to get round the government's cash freeze on its pay bill.
Downing Street officials said politically sensitive groups such as nurses
and doctors could expect the government to meet the recommendations of
independent pay review bodies for rises this year of between 2.5 per cent
and 3 per cent.
The softening in the interpretation of the freeze in the public-sector pay
bill announced in last November's Budget came as Mr Major said he regretted
raising taxes after pledging at the 1992 election to reduce them.
But amid further fierce exchanges in the Commons over the impending tax
increases, the prime minister insisted that the Conservatives had not
deceived voters at the last election.
He said: 'Events have forced us to raise taxes. I regret that. But it is
necessary to raise taxes to make sure that we cut the borrowing requirement
and provide the opportunity for sustained growth with low inflation.'
The prime minister also won unexpected backing from Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, who said that Labour's spending plans would mean still
higher taxes.
As a threatened Tory rebellion failed to materialise, the Commons last night
rejected an amendment to the Finance Bill that would have blocked the
imposition of value added tax on fuel. The government also secured a
comfortable majority on the overall provisions of the bill. But Mrs Margaret
Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, insisted that 'the biggest tax hike in
British history' marked a 'total deception' that the electorate would not
forget.
Downing Street indicated that the prime minister was 'relaxed' about a
decision by the independent pay review bodies to link their recommendations
to the 2.7 per cent increase that MPs have awarded themselves.
Most Whitehall departments could expect efficiency savings of at least 2 per
cent and perhaps 3 per cent, suggesting that government would be able to
meet most of, if not all, the review bodies' recommendations without
breaching spending targets.
The officials insisted that that did not represent a relaxation of controls
on the pay bill. It was also suggested that while the 1.5m workers covered
by the review bodies could expect rises above the present 1.9 per cent
inflation rate, the other 3m public-sector employees could expect tougher
settlements.
But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, signalled a marked shift in
presentation. He insisted in the immediate aftermath of the Budget that
savings from improved efficiency in the public sector should be ploughed
back into improved services as well as into higher pay. Last night he
emphasised that he expected 'sensible settlements' from the pay review
bodies.
His stance confirmed that, with the average family due to pay an extra
Pounds 12.50 a week in tax from April, the government has lost the appetite
for a confrontation.
Ministers acknowledged that the latest furore had significantly weakened
their bargaining position.

FT  26 JAN 94 / Fisons to cut 1,000 jobs in shake-up: Partial closure of
main plant - Some production will transfer to France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals company, is to cut 1,000 jobs from a total of
6,400 as part of a restructuring programme to restore its reputation and
fortunes after last month's dismissal of Mr Cedric Scroggs, its chief
executive, and a collapse in profits.
The two-year programme will cost Pounds 15m. It will include the partial
closure of the company's main production site at Holmes Chapel, Cheshire,
with the immediate loss of 250 jobs.
Eventually, up to 700 UK jobs will go from every part of the company, said
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman and acting chief executive. Some production will
be transferred to France and there will be 'senior management changes to
create a flatter structure'.
Fisons' other main division, scientific equipment, is unaffected.
The restructuring is the first big decision from the company since it issued
a profit warning on December 13 - the third in two years - which said that
Fisons would only break even in 1993. Analysts had been expecting a pre-tax
profit of about Pounds 100m. Mr Scroggs, with Mr Roy Thomas, finance
director, went on the same day.
The restructuring will save Fisons Pounds 35m a year in costs. 'There will
be some contribution to the bottom line this year, but the full effect will
not be seen until 1996,' said Mr Egan.
He said there was 'plenty of fat' to be cut in the company. 'Along with
other (pharmaceuticals) companies, Fisons has not been concerned very much
with costs,' Mr Egan said.
The job cuts come in all parts of the company's pharmaceuticals business and
some compulsory redundancies are likely.
The partial closure of the Holmes Chapel site comes more than three years
after the US Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of two products
made at the plant, citing low standards.
'Some of the money already invested to improve the plant will (now) be
wasted,' Mr Egan said. A new plant will be built at the site as part of a
Pounds 100m investment over four years.
That will not prevent the transfer of the manufacture of a range of products
to a Fisons plant at Le Trait, near Rouen, France.
The French plant will make a range of liquid products such as anti-allergy
nasal sprays.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Gains from sale of investments
helps CGIP to maintain profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capital gains from the sale of investments should allow CGIP, the French
holding company, to report steady profits for 1993, according to Mr
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, the group chairman.
Mr Seilliere described 1993 as a difficult year. But during an interview he
said that 'after taking into account a net capital gain of FFr150m (Dollars
25.68m) from disposals made in the course of the year, we will maintain
without doubt our profit compared with 1992'. Then, CGIP reported net
profits of FFr542.6m.
The disposals made during the year included a 2.5 per cent stake in Valeo,
the vehicle components group, and 4.4 per cent of Cap Gemini Sogeti, the
computer services group.
The holding company has rebuilt its reserves through a convertible bond
issue at the beginning of this month. The issue, which raised about FFr1bn,
was aimed at strengthening the group's balance sheet following a number of
acquisitions and an increase in its stake in CarnaudMetalBox, the
Anglo-French packaging group, from 25.3 per cent to just over 32 per cent.
Mr Seilliere ruled out the possibility of a merger between the holding
company and the packaging group. 'CGIP is evolving in a logic of control
which is favourable to our shareholders. The hypothesis of a merger is not
envisaged' he said.
He said that a decision on the group's dividend would be taken by the
shareholders' assembly in June. 'Between now and then we will have a clearer
view of the development of our investments which, we hope, will allow us to
continue our policy of distribution.' he said.
CGIP, which paid a dividend of FFr32 in 1992, has generally increased its
dividend payments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saab Automobile is ready to discuss co-operation projects with Volvo, its
rival Swedish car maker which last month scrapped a plan to merge with
France's Renault, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, Saab chief executive, said
yesterday.
He said he was open for discussion on common development and production of
car components, pointing out in an interview with a Swedish news agency that
the two companies already shared a number of component suppliers in Sweden.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse, a Briton, said he had spoken to Mr Lennart Jeansson, a
senior Volvo executive and former head of car operations, about the
possibility of working together on 'a range of things. That is no problem'.
He added that he would like to meet Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive,
'as soon as possible so that we can get to know each other'.
The interview was quickly seized upon by Swedish media as a potentially
significant overture from Saab that could bring the two Swedish
manufacturers closer together. But officials at both Volvo and Saab, which
is jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania,
played down Mr Butler-Wheelhouse's remarks.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Stuck in a nightmare of debt: Pressure is growing on
Trinidad and Tobago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a clear attempt to prepare for increasing stringency, Trinidad and
Tobago's political leaders are being colourfully blunt about the problems of
the once-buoyant economy which is facing continued uncertainty, due mainly
to the state of the oil market.
'In the same way that to make a cake you have to break an egg, as we move to
economic prosperity there is necessarily a period of difficulty,' said Mr
Patrick Manning, the prime minister.
Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, has confessed to a 'major
nightmare' with the country's finances, and has asked his countrymen for
'patience and sacrifice' while the government tries to massage the stagnant
economy.
These are trying times for the lop-sided, oil dependent economy, once as
healthy as any in the Caribbean basin, but now suffering from the prolonged
lassitude of the international oil market. The government is being forced
increasingly towards austerity and fiscal prudence as organised labour,
always truculent, is becoming increasingly annoyed.
The cause of Mr Mottley's nightmare is the demand of servicing the country's
foreign debt with reduced income from oil. Trinidad and Tobago's per capita
foreign debt, at Dollars 2,416, is higher than most of the more well-known
debtor countries.
The English-speaking republic of 1.2m people is a small oil producer, with
output averaging 150,000 barrels per day in better times. Each time the oil
price falls the economy is further pressurised to meet debt servicing costs
 -Dollars 608m this year, almost one third of export receipts.
'The implications of the high debt service for economic growth are
significant,' said Mr Mottley. 'In order to free the resources to meet the
debt service in this period, this country must cut back on its overall
expenditure, both consumption and investment expenditures.'
For the 1994 budget, Mr Mottley announced new taxes on petrol, financial
services, vehicle transfers and cigarettes, and the extension of a business
levy to cover the self-employed. The money is needed to finance expenditure
of TTDollars 7.7bn (Dollars 1.4bn).
The government's handling of the economy and its proposals to create
stability have been attacked by its critics. 'I don't see that the budget is
going to make a difference,' said Mr Basdeo Panday, leader of the main
opposition party.
'It seems to be a continuation of last year. Although the minister mentions
that he is aware of what the problems are in the society, he has really not
said anything about tackling them in a serious way.'
The government, however, is getting support from the business community. The
Employers Consultative Council said the government was 'courageous' in
building on earlier efforts at economic reform, and had presented 'a budget
of new enlightenment and rededication of purpose, not a pause for
refreshment'.
The earlier reforms implemented by Mr Manning's administration included the
deregulation of the foreign exchange market in May, when the currency was
floated and controls lifted on currency movements.
The government has also been divesting state-owned economic enterprises. It
has sold its wholly-owned urea plant and its 51 per cent stake in an ammonia
plant to raise money to help service its foreign debt.
Its plan to sack thousands of workers from three state-owned utility
companies has raised the hackles of organised labour, which is also opposed
to the divestment of state enterprises. The government claims that the port
authority and the public transport and water companies recorded a cumulative
loss of TTDollars 342m in 1992. The state owes public servants about
TTDollars 3bn, which the government says it cannot pay.
The government faces some difficulty in stimulating the economy. Continuing
contraction in the petroleum and manufacturing sectors has led the
government to a preliminary assessment of economic growth of 1 per cent last
year, and a forecast of about the same for this year, following a decline of
1.6 per cent in 1992.
Mr Mottley recently visited financial capitals testing the market for a
Dollars 100m Eurobond issue to help meet debt payments, after the success of
a similar issue last year.
There are now darker clouds on the horizon. Last month's budget, and the
government's economic plans, were predicated on oil prices at Dollars 19 per
barrel. The slump in prices since will force the government into more
unpopular stringency which is unlikely to end Mr Mottley's nightmare.

Indonesia's labour record, yesterday said Jakarta fell far short in its
treatment of workers, despite recent reforms, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
'Increased industrial unrest, activism and international pressure have
resulted in some useful but inadequate measures by the Indonesian government
to address violations of internationally-recognised worker rights,' it said.

Pakistan yesterday said it would seek a human rights resolution, condemning
India's actions in Kashmir, during next month's UN commission on human
rights in Geneva, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The move immediately raised speculation over whether Islamabad was backing
away from its bilateral dialogue with New Delhi.
'In the new world, India cannot raise a new iron curtain to hide its
shortcomings,' said Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, on television.
She said she would address the commission on February 1.

Lesotho's cabinet held a crisis session yesterday during a lull in fighting
between rival army factions, Reuter reports from Maseru.
The capital remained tense but shops and businesses opened. Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle appeared to have shifted ground over a request for South
African military intervention. South Africa said Lesotho had requested such
help, but Mr Mokhehle said this was only one option and nothing had been
decided. Five soldiers have died since fighting began 10 days ago.

Guangdong's 1993 exports were Dollars 26.3bn, 43 per cent higher than 1992
and the highest of any province in China for the eighth successive year, and
imports were Dollars 19.1bn. It gave no comparison.
Contracted foreign investment was Dollars 34.9bn, 76 per cent up on 1992,

said.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Austrian leader denies he will quit over affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Austrian president, Mr Thomas Klestil, who is under increasing political
pressure over a love affair with an aide, denied yesterday he was
considering resignation, Reuter reports from Vienna.
'I will survive this,' Austrian state television quoted Mr Klestil as
saying, breaking a 48-hour silence on the growing scandal. In its main news
bulletin, the TV station said Mr Klestil's office had confirmed the text of
an interview in which the president declared himself 'optimistic' and ruled
out any thought of resigning.
Mr Klestil's wife of 37 years, Edith, left him earlier this month saying she
could no longer bear his close relationship with the aide, Ms Margot
Loffler, 39, who like Mr Klestil was a career diplomat.
The 61-year-old president promised at the weekend he would act quickly to
resolve his personal crisis, but yesterday political friends and media
commentators increased pressure on him for a clear choice between mistress
and job.
Mr Klestil, in the interview due to appear in today's Die Presse newspaper,
said he would go ahead with a scheduled speech at the United Nations
building in Vienna on the role of family values in bolstering world peace.
A polished politician allied to the conservative People's party (OeVP), Mr
Klestil was elected president in 1992, replacing Kurt Waldheim, whose term
of office was overshadowed by allegations of Nazi wartime crimes. Although
largely ceremonial and non-partisan, the office of president is highly
respected by Austrians, many of whom defended Mr Waldheim the more he was
ostracised abroad.
Most commentators believe Mr Klestil can remain in office only if he parts
with Ms Loffler. Damage also is great for his party, the junior partner in
the coalition government. It has steadily lost ground to the Freedom party
of right-wing populist, Mr Joerg Haider. If Mr Klestil decided to resign,
the country would face new presidential elections in a political year
already booked full with a general election, state polls and a referendum on
joining the EU.
'If Klestil wants to show he's fit for office he'll sign the order to send
her (Ms Loffler) as special envoy to Finland,' said the Taglich Alles
newspaper.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese share prices plunged yesterday amid fears of turmoil after the
defeat of political reform bills initiated by Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa.
The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares fell 954.19 points, or 4.9 per cent,
the largest single-day drop since August 1991, as shaken investors and
dealers rushed to unload their holdings.
Investors were also worried that political difficulties might further delay
the government's ability to stimulate the stumbling economy. The Keidanren,
the leading business federation, called on Mr Hosokawa not to call a snap
general election. Prolonged political uncertainty would further damage the
economy, warned Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the Keidanren's chairman.
Parliamentary officials of the ruling seven-party coalition met members of
the opposition Liberal Democratic party to try to form a joint panel of the
upper and lower houses as a forum for compromise. They plan to meet again
today.
The LDP blamed 'co-ordination' difficulties. The party is divided between a
minority who seek a watered-down version of the political reform plans - the
leadership's official line - and a majority who have strong reservations
over the proposed abandonment of Japan's multi-seat constituency system.
In one small sign of possible progress, the leadership of the Social
Democratic party, the largest coalition partner, said it was ready to meet
the LDP.
If, as is likely, Mr Hosokawa fails to get an agreement by the end of the
present parliamentary session on Saturday at midnight, the bills will
expire. Mr Hosokawa will then be under pressure to carry out his implied
promise to resign, although he is Japan's most popular politician.
Political observers believe that if Mr Hosokawa does resign, he would hand
over the prime ministership to a leading member of the seven-party
coalition, rather than call an election.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and leader of the Japan Renewal party, set
up last June by defectors from the LDP, or Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of
the New Harbinger party, another former LDP splinter group, are thought to
be front runners for the job.
On the Tokyo stock market, traders expect further turbulence this week due
to the uncertainty surrounding Mr Hosokawa's efforts to formulate a
compromise out of the reform bills by Saturday. 'There's no knowing how much
the market could fall if Mr Hosokawa is forced to resign,' warned Mr Takashi
Kanasaki, a director at Yamaichi Securities.
On the foreign exchange, political worries also prompted selling of the yen
against the dollar. It closed Y0.80 down against the dollar at Y112.10.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ciga plans capital write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Ciga, the heavily-indebted Italian-based luxury hotel group,
said yesterday it would propose to shareholders that the company's nominal
share capital be cut to L91.72bn (Dollars 54.08m) from L185.25bn.
Ciga is the subject of competing bids from Forte, the UK hotels and
restaurant groups, and Host Marriott of the US.
The capital write-down for the hotels group, which lost L195.43bn last year,
would be carried out by reducing the nominal share value to L379 from the
present L1,000.
Shareholders will be issued with 30 new ordinary shares for every 79
ordinary shares currently held.
The board said an extraordinary shareholders meeting would also have to
approve a capital increase of around L1,100bn to cover net debt.
It said, however, that the conditions of the capital rise could not be set
until creditor banks had reached agreement on a rescue plan.
Host Marriott last month suspended negotiations with Ciga because it said it
had not been given sufficient information about the Forte bid.
It said yesterday these issues had now been resolved and added: 'We are
still very much interested in acquiring the hotel chain.'
Forte said earlier this month it was discussing a joint bid for Ciga with Mr
George Soros, the international financier.
Forte said it had joined with Mr Soros's Quantum Fund to make a revised
offer to Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank overseeing the restructuring of
the chain.
Forte's original agreement with Mediobanca, concluded last year, would have
led to it paying Pounds 33m (Dollars 49.2m) in cash and putting some of its
hotels, worth Pounds 125m, into an operating company in which it would have
had a majority interest.

Two of the main business programmes on BBC Radio 4 are to move to the new
Radio 5 Live news and sports network due to launch on March 28.
The Financial World Tonight and The Financial Week are moving to the new
network as part of its expanded financial and business coverage.
Ms Jenny Abramsky, controller of the new network, promised yesterday that it
would be fun, would take risks and woulkd try to involve listeners by
putting them in touch with people in the news and BBC correspondents.
Ms Abramsky outlined a draft schedule for the network that will replace
Radio 5. The schedule includes a one-hour news round-up at 5am followed by a
breakfast programme lasting 2 1/2 hours, a two-hour lunchtime programme and
a three-hour drive-time programme that will include coverage from all main
regional centres in the UK.
The Radio 5 Live controller also promised a look back to see what happened
to prominent stories when the headlines are over, and regular personality
profiles made by independent producers.
Market research suggests that up to 29 per cent of the population would try
such a station, a quarter of whom do not listen to any BBC radio stations.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Minister raps council over Tupe obstacle to contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environment department yesterday ruled that a local authority had acted
anti-competitively when it refused to disclose details of its workforce's
pay and conditions to a private company bidding for a contract. The council
believed that the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations,
known as Tupe, applied to the contract, which meant that the bidder would be
obliged to accept the workforce on its existing terms and conditions. The
council insisted that Tupe terms would apply, but refused to say what they
were.
Yesterday's decision by the environment minister, Mr Tony Baldry, signals a
crackdown on councils' use of the regulations. He said: 'I am determined to
ensure that the treatment of Tupe by local authorities should not stand in
the way of fair competition.'
Langbaurgh-on-Tees Borough Council will now have to re-tender the contract.
Three other authorities, the London borough of Redbridge, Southampton City
Council and Bassetlaw District Council, have also been issued with statutory
notices asking them to explain their actions in awarding work to their own
labour force in possible breach of competitive tendering rules, following
allegations of anti-competitive behaviour in their treatment of Tupe.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Arabs' Israeli boycott to be reconsidered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday said he had received
assurances that, at its next ministerial meeting in March, the Arab League
would consider revoking its boycott against foreign companies which do
business with Israel.
The league will also reconsider its tertiary embargo - against companies
which do substantial business with companies trading with Israel.
Mr Brown, who had just returned from an eight-day tour of the Middle East,
said he had carried one consistent message to Arab leaders: that the boycott
 -against Israel and companies which deal with Israel - was 'an anachronism'
and counterproductive.
'It deprives the region of human and economic resources needed to boost
economic growth,' he said. 'It probably hurts most the people it is designed
to help - the Palestinians.'
Mr Brown said his argument had wrung from Mr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the Arab
League secretary general, a promise that the league would take up the
question of the boycott against companies which trade with Israel. It was
hurting American companies, he said.
He expected the primary boycott, against Israel, to be discussed in the
context of the peace negotiations.
Mr Brown also urged Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Shimon
Peres, foreign minister, to lift the Israeli boycott against Arabs.
In a press briefing on returning, Mr Brown also had hard words for Japan,
which he said must agree to 'a targeted results-oriented approach' in its
negotiating framework with the US. Japan's trade surplus with the US is
heading towards Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40.5bn) in 1994.
If Japan does not agree to specific targets, than the US may set them
unilaterally, he said. 'We're ready and willing to explore any vehicle that
we think can have an impact on our unacceptable trade imbalance,' he said.
'We have an Dollars 80bn trade deficit. . . Dollars 50bn with one country.
We think we have to take tough and aggressive action to overcome this.'
The Clinton administration would not wait for Japan to resolve its political
crisis. 'We have to deal with the people who are in charge,' Mr Brown said.
On his mission, Mr Brown visited Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and the
occupied territories both to promote US products and to prepare for peace.
The US is mobilising resources to quickly spur economic development in the
region.
He is working with an organisation called Building for Peace, a group of
Jewish and Arab-American businessmen, who want to develop the West Bank and
Gaza.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris move from
weakness to strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outstanding feature yesterday was the move from weakness to strength in
both Frankfurt and Paris, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT dug itself out of Friday's depression, but not before the Dax
index had fallen nearly 40 points to a morning low of 2,035.76. Worries
about possibly negative M3 and inflation indicators weighed it down, said Mr
Nigel Longley at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
However, sentiment was rescued by January inflation figures from North Rhine
Westphalia which, at 3.3 per cent per annum, were slower than expected. The
Dax moved to an official close of 2,080.01, up a token 4.40, and carried on
climbing in the post bourse to end at an Ibis-indicated 2,107.29, 3.5 per
cent above its nadir.
Turnover fell from DM13.7bn to DM10.5bn. At the official close there were
more significant losses than gains among blue chips, but the rising dollar
brought strength to the big three chemical stocks, where Bayer led with a
gain of DM8.50 to DM351.50.
Elsewhere, Siemens rose DM9.60 to DM715 with its weak profits news
apparently digested and the pharmaceuticals group, Schering, put on DM42, or
4 per cent to DM1,065 on its BetaSeron prospects, and after a fall from a
1993/94 high of DM1,188.50.
All this compensated for weakness in banks, depressed by their rights
issues, and in automotive stocks. After hours, the March Dax future closed
39.5 higher at 2,129, and US buying took Bayer and Siemens further ahead, to
DM358 and DM721 respectively.
PARIS closed the account on a high note on lingering hopes that the Bank of
France might make a small cut in interest rates this morning. Support for
companies which have recently reported 1993 results also contributed to the
improved sentiment which lifted the CAC-40 index by 30.52, or 1.4 per cent
to 2,274.49.
Turnover was firm at FFr5.4bn.
Among the day's most actives UAP rose FFr43 or 7 per cent to FFr650 after
the insurer made a favourable estimate for 1993 and said that it was seeking
to expand into the UK in an effort to increase its market share.
St Gobain continued to firm following last week's good earnings news, the
shares adding another FFr22 or 3.3 per cent to FFr686, while Bouygues firmed
FFr18 to FFr733 ahead of today's results.
Both Euro Disney and Eurotunnel performed well, the former gaining FFr1.45
to FFr37.35 and the latter FFr2.05 to FFr51.95, lifted by news that the UK
government had confirmed the route of the fast rail link from London to the
Channel ports.
AMSTERDAM built on Friday's advance and the AEX index pushed briefly through
the 430 level during the session before settling back to close 1.23 higher
at 429.75.
Good gains continued to be achieved by the heavily weighted stocks, such as
Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.60 at Fl 213.60. However, there was also strong
activity elsewhere as investors digested positive news. Polygram, for
instance, rose during the session to an all-time high on reports that it was
involved in discussions to establish a new music-video television channel.
The shares finally closed up Fl 1.90 at Fl 80.10.
Fokker also went higher on reports that it had secured a Fl 250m contract to
supply aircraft to a French airline, with the shares ending up Fl 1.50 to Fl
23.50.
MILAN recouped Friday's losses on strength in the industrial sector. The
Comit index improved 4.30 to 617.90.
Montedison led the rise, gaining 1.9 per cent to L1,015 as hopes resurfaced
for a recovery in this sector. Olivetti also benefited from renewed hopes
that it would win the second cellular telecom licence to be awarded later
this year, the shares putting on L79 to L2,358.
Fiat was another of the day's gainers with suggestions that it might sell
one of its divisions - Snia being mentioned. The carmaker added L66 to
L4,510, and Snia L43 to L1,605.
ZURICH recovered from early weakness to close steady, but in very limited
trading, the SMI index closing 2.5 higher at 3,041.8.
MADRID eased across the board after hitting a succession of all-time highs
last week, the general index falling 2.29 to 339.01 in turnover of
Pta33.9bn.
In banks, BCH lost Pta80, or 2.5 per cent to Pta3,085 in volume of over
900,000 shares.
DUBLIN was pulled back by a bout of profit-taking following the market's
strong forward movement since the beginning of the year, said Mr Adrian
O'Carroll at Dillon Read. The ISEQ index closed down 17.98 at 2,049.48.
ATHENS continued its recovery after last week's corrections, the general
index closing 27.46 higher at 1,176.83; but brokers were not sure of its
next move, saying that there was support at 1,150, and resistance at 1,200.
ISTANBUL tumbled by nearly 7 per cent as the central bank continued to raise
short-term borrowing rates to defend the lira against the dollar. The
composite index ended at a provisional 24,260.75, down 1,812.17. Written and

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Measured view of Japan's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the Japanese government to secure passage of the political
reform bill through parliament last Friday came too late to affect the
performance of that country's component in the FT-Actuaries World index.
However, yesterday's sharp fall in the Nikkei average as a consequence of
the bill's defeat could, barring an uptick later in the week, have a
significant short term effect on the Asian markets in particular and the
world in general.
Nevertheless, many strategists remain confident about the longer term
picture in Japan, with Nomura's Mr Nicholas Knight, for instance, making the
point that an economic stimulation package still looks likely.
'Whatever their differences with regard to political reform, all (parties)
are agreed upon the need for significant further economic stimulation, via a
package containing substantial income tax cuts and further spending
measures: a cut in the discount rate also becomes an immediate probability,'
he says.
Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson also takes a more measured view of
Japan's current political crisis. He notes that a number of fund managers
have been making strategic moves into the market recently, and that others
are likely to move in now as equity prices fall, thereby underpinning the
Nikkei.
'I am still quite happy about things,' he said yesterday, 'since this sort
of volatility is not a major surprise: we have seen the Nikkei reach 21,000
(in August 1993), then slip to 16,000 (in November 1993), before bouncing
back to 19,000. What we have seen now is people unwinding positions on hopes
that the reform package would be passed: those same people will return on a
12-month view, given expectations of further interest rate cuts and other
fiscal incentives.'
Volatility in Asia was also expressed last week in Malaysia, measuring the
world's largest one-week decline, and contrasting with Hong Kong's similar
but positive advance. Kuala Lumpur, comments Mr David Bates of Asia Equity,
has been affected by worries over a provincial election in Subah and foreign
exchange instability.
However, it is also worth keeping in mind that Malaysia enjoyed a 50 per
cent rise in local currency terms in the last quarter of 1993.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Work resumes at privatised mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners who lost their jobs under British Coal's closure programme yesterday
returned to work at their former pit in Nottinghamshire, reopened under
private management.
Clipstone Colliery near Mansfield is the first of 28 collieries offered by
British Coal to the private sector to be formally handed over.
The 140 miners who joined the first shift of the privatised regime yesterday
promised to work 'harder than ever' to make the pit a success.
Mr Richard Budge, chairman of RJB Mining, which has agreed an eight-year
lease on the colliery from British Coal, said that the pay rates under which
the miners had been re-engaged were comparable to those they achieved at
British Coal.
'In some cases they are getting more working for us than at British Coal,'
he said.
Mr Budge said the company was introducing flexible working practices and
multi-skilling, with fewer grades and less demarcation than existed under
British Coal.
RJB Mining operates three other mines in Cumbria and Scotland.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (4): Risks for
directors grow - The public wants stricter corporate accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blame it on Maxwell, Guinness, Polly Peck, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster or
multi-million pound pay-offs to Britain's business leaders - whatever the
reason, standards of corporate governance are under the microscope.
When things go wrong the public no longer seems prepared simply for a
company to be in the dock; it wants the individuals responsible to be
identified and held accountable.
It is not just executive directors in the firing line, either. Other
managers and officers in positions of authority in a company may also find
themselves held accountable. Non-executive directors are no less vulnerable
than their executive colleagues. And shadow directors - individuals on whose
instruction or direction a company acts - can also find themselves under
attack.
Directors have become used to the idea that shareholders will sue the board
of a company for mismanagement after an unexpected trading loss. They know,
too, that they can be sued during takeovers, either by shareholders unhappy
with the new board, or by the incoming board alleging misrepresentation
against the outgoing directors.
But recent legislative changes have also greatly increased the potential
liability faced by directors and officers.
The 1985 Companies Act sets out more than 200 offences with which a director
or officer can be charged. There are further offences under health and
safety, environmental, data protection and financial services legislation
which can result in a fine, imprisonment or both.
The potential personal exposure of directors was increased markedly by the
Insolvency Act and by the Company Directors Disqualification Act. And there
is more legislation to come - particularly from Europe - in the company,
environmental and financial services fields.
As trade barriers come down and the business world grows closer together,
companies doing business across borders can find themselves facing
unexpected liabilities in foreign jurisdictions. Investment in the US
carries with it a substantial risk of litigation. Actions or the threat of
actions against directors are a commonly used tactic in takeover battles.
Martin Piers, partner of Gouldens, solicitors, says that UK lawyers and
insurers at the recent Professional Liability Underwriting Society
conference in Chicago were horrified by tales of the American Plaintiff
Bar's ability to launch actions for 'securities fraud' against directors
within hours of a significant drop in a company's share price.
Delegates who took heart from the fact that such actions cannot be brought
in the UK would have derived less comfort, he says, from the view expressed
by US delegates and attorneys with knowledge of the UK market that the
picture being painted of the UK situation was a little too rosy.
Had US delegates known about the 1992 English case in which the court ruled
that a director or officer can be held personally liable for a claim by a
former employee who has suffered an industrial injury during the course of
his employment, their assessment may have been less favourable. Employment
practices claims are now the leading class of action against directors and
officers in the US.
Part of the solution to the growing number of potential liabilities faced by
directors is directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&amp;O).
Mr Roger Flaxman, a director of Miller Professional Liabilities, says that
between 1984 and 1991 the UK market premium for directors' and officers'
liability insurance grew from about Pounds 6m to Pounds 35m. Since 1991 the
annual premium income from D&amp;O insurance has risen to almost Pounds 75m.
The initial reason for the jump in the UK market premium was the 1989
Companies Act.
This made clear, for the first time, that although a company cannot
indemnify its directors, it can buy D&amp;O cover for its directors and officers
and pay the premium without worrying about the legality or enforceability of
the contract.
The act also requires companies to mention the purchase or maintenance of
D&amp;O cover in its annual reports and accounts. The effect of this, says Mr
Flaxman, has been to heighten directors' appreciation of potential
liabilities which resulted in an enormous increase in enquiries to the D&amp;O
insurance market.
The requirement to mention D&amp;O cover in annual reports also has an
unlooked-for effect: it tips off those contemplating legal action against a
company or its directors of a potential 'deep pocket' to sue, thereby
encouraging claims.
Claims have certainly increased. It is estimated that there are more than
1,000 claims outstanding against UK company directors. The value of the
claims averages Pounds 70,000.
However, having encouraged the purchase of D&amp;O cover through the 1989 act,
the government now appears to be doing its best to discourage it, by
allowing the Inland Revenue to tax directors and officers, who buy it, on
the premium, or on the proceeds of a claim, as a benefit in kind.
Lawyers' current advice to directors is to pay tax on the premium, rather
than risk tax on the actual benefit deemed to accrue by successfully
defending a claim of more than Pounds 70,000.
But if what happens in the US today happens in the UK tomorrow - as is often
the case - paying tax on the premium itself may soon become a considerable
tax burden. In the US the average cost of cover per director is already
somewhere between Pounds 17,000 and Pounds 20,000.
Mr Flaxman believes the UK Inland Revenue must be persuaded to drop this. He
says that D&amp;O cover provides no personal benefit whatever in an individual
director's private capacity. The benefit is to a director in his corporate
capacity, therefore it should not be subject to taxation as benefit in kind.
If the Revenue persists with this approach and, in particular, if
non-executive directors have to pay tax on each non-executive directorship,
there is a real danger that the competent and honest non-executive
directors, on whom the government is counting to improve standards in the
boardroom, may begin to decline appointments.
But insurance is not the whole solution to the problem, either. For example,
it does not cover liability for environmental pollution - something
directors are increasingly concerned about.
Mr Nigel Graham Maw, the former senior partner of Rowe &amp; Maw, City
solicitors, believes that the key to allaying public anxiety over boardroom
behaviour, which has been fed by recent scandals, is the adoption of a
general code of corporate governance going beyond the recommendations of the
Cadbury Committee.
Mr Graham Maw has just written the first UK book on corporate governance. In
it he sets out a suggested code of practice which, he says, ought to be
adopted and complied with by the boards of all companies to which the City
Takeover Code applies.
'A code should be mandatory,' he says. 'Companies can write their own, but
it ought to be no less stringent than ours.'
His code, which covers the constitution of the board, audit and remuneration
committees, the functioning of the board and accountability, is tougher than
Cadbury in that it includes a number of mandatory requirements.
It stresses the role of non-executive directors in improving standards, and
it provides, among other things:
that a minimum of one third of the total number of directors must be
non-executives;
the chairman should be a non-executive, but if for some reason he is not,
the deputy chairman must be a non-executive;
non-executives' remuneration must not be performance or project related;
companies must have audit and remuneration committees, all the members of
which must be non-executives.
'It won't rid the country of scandals such as the Maxwell scandal, but it
can reduce the risk of them,' Mr Graham Maw says.
He also believes that corporate governance is not an area which lends itself
to statutory regulation. If things are to improve, he says, then standards
of self-regulation will have to rise.
That means that bodies such as the Stock Exchange must take a tougher line
on bad corporate behaviour. If these steps are taken, then the UK may yet
turn the corner on directors' liability.

FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Beer price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hints of a retail price war in Britain's bars and public houses kept brewery
stocks subdued. A trade magazine published yesterday highlighted a
'79p-a-pint' promotion by one regional brewery group, and recent reports of
similar offers from some of the leading drinks groups were enough to mark
drinks stocks down sharply as the market opened.
'The threat of a retail price war will be the enduring story of 1994,' said
one analyst. Another, Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities, said that the
concern was a nagging one rather than anything fundamental, but added: 'The
sector can probably shrug off price promotions lasting a month - the worry
is if they run and run.'
Not all the stocks were hit. Whitbread 'A', one of the most vulnerable to
the threat of a price war, rose 7 to 614p but turnover was miserly.
Elsewhere, most stocks rallied from the early falls. Bass lost 6 on balance
at 590p, Greene King 4 at 565p, Allied- Lyons 4 at 659p, Scottish &amp;
Newcastle a penny at 580p and Greenalls 3 at 483p. Guinness, thought to be
resilient to the discounting threat, jumped 21 to 539p with 7m traded.
The minor drag on the SG Warburg share price in recent weeks triggered by
the legal dispute between the largest of the UK merchant banks and Yeoman
International, the Irish financial services group, dissolved yesterday when
the two groups agreed an out of court settlement.
Warburg, which was being sued for Pounds 155m by Yeoman, said the terms of
the settlement 'will have an insignificant effect' on its profit and loss
account and financial position. Warburg rallied 8 to 982p.
The high street banks were featured by yet more bullish comment from leading
brokers. Last week's positive note from Morgan Stanley was followed by an
upgrade by SG Warburg Securities. Barclays advanced 14 to 635p in heavy
turnover of 9.2m. The broker was also said to have promoted TSB, a penny
firmer at 289p after a hefty 7.2m changing hands. National Westminster, seen
as cheap relative to Barclays and where there was talk of imminent switching
activity, also made progress, adding 6 at 611p.
US buyers continued to be attracted to aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce,
sending the stock 8 higher to 185p. Volume rose to 20m, making it one of the
day's most actively traded stocks. Reports that the government was about to
raise the 29 per cent maximum foreign ownership limit continued to be heard.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 34m as US buyers joined European investors
moving into the stock. A broker's recommendation last week attracted
European buyers to the stock, but it was reports of a return to
profitability for US steel companies that attracted US investors to the
British stock. The shares put on 4 at 132 1/2 p. UK merchant bank Kleinwort
Benson was also said to be positive.
British Aerospace climbed 16 to 444p after a weekend press report that Honda
Motor is negotiating to raise its stake in BAe subsidiary Rover cars from 20
per cent to 40 per cent.
Food retailers suffered amid continued talk of retrenchment and
restructuring. J. Sainsbury, the focus of much weekend press speculation
over whether or not it would follow the example of close rival Tesco and cut
back its expenditure programme, dipped 2 1/2 to 457 1/2 p. Tesco receded 6
to 237 1/2 p with 7.6m traded.
In an otherwise flat food manufacturing sector, Unigate added 3 at 430p,
with SG Warburg highlighting the stock's strong dividend flow prospects.
There was further speculation ahead of results this Thursday from MFI, the
furniture store group.
Last week the shares had come under pressure as some in the market suggested
that the results would be accompanied by a dull trading statement. However,
the stock's supporters were evident yesterday, with confident predictions of
MFI profits ahead of the forecast range of Pounds 18m to Pounds 25m. The
shares responded, advancing 9 to 176p. Turnover reached a hefty 5m.
Sparkling results from John Menzies sent the shares surging 30 to 654p.
Reports that Rank Organisation planned an expansion of its film interests
lifted the stock 15 to 1089p. Ladbroke nudged up a penny to 208p as the
comapny announced an Pounds 86m windfall from the relinquishing of a Hong
Kong hotel management contract.
Electronics group Molynx slumped 10 1/2 to 25p after warning of a
significant loss for 1993. The company said last month it was involved in
takeover talks with Silvermines. Yesterday Molynx said it had agreed
preliminary terms which would indicate a value in the region of 25p a Molynx
share.
Transport group Goode Durrant held at 165p after a 25 per cent stake, some
13m shares, in the company, formerly held by Winnedale, were placed by
Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, at 159p a share.
Bett Brothers, the building and property group, forged ahead 23 to 150p
after a block of shares moved through the market via an agency cross carried
out at that price.

FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers rise on UAP hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The composite insurance sector burst into life during afternoon trading as
marketmakers latched on to a story that UAP, the French insurance giant, had
indicated to shareholders that it was seeking to increase its presence in
the UK insurance market.
'The market's immediate reaction was to hoist the share prices of all the
leading composites,' said one marketmaker. The story emanated from Paris,
where chief executive Mr Didier Pfeiffer was quoted as telling UAP
shareholders: 'This weakness in the United Kingdom may be dealt with in the
current financial year.'
Speculation in the market initially focused on Royal Insurance, but quickly
spread to Sun Alliance and ultimately to Commercial Union. Insurance sector
specialists, however, remained unconvinced by the stories and pointed to the
absence of any determined activity in any of the composites' shares.
One leading analyst said it was most unlikely that UAP would attempt a major
takeover in the UK 'in the middle of the massive privatisations in France',
and also said the group 'does not have the financial resources to move for
one of the big UK companies'.
Sun Alliance ended 14 higher at 404p on 2.7m shares traded, Commercial Union
rose 13 to 709p on 861,000 dealt, Royal moved up 12 to 341p on 3.8m
transacted and General Accident added 10 at 738p.

FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early loss recovered in modest
trading volume - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good recovery was made by UK stocks from early falls which reflected
concern over both the setback in Tokyo equities and also the disclosure last
weekend of the impending tax burden due to fall on UK shareholders in April
when the November Budget measures take effect. Shares were helped by a
favourable response to the latest industrial trends survey from the
Confederation of British Industry.
The rally, which reduced the fall in the FT-SE 100 Index from nearly 22
points to only 2.8, followed a similar recovery in other European stock
markets. The UK insurance sector provided a lead for London following
reports that Union des Assurances de Paris said it was seeking to increase
business in Britain, which was translated by UK investors as suggesting bid
moves.
Overall, the stock market lacked conviction. After opening steadily, in
spite of Tokyo's 4.9 per cent fall, the Footsie edged ahead 3.2 points. But
3,478.4 proved to be the top of the day and equities turned down as stock
index futures reacted to the initial weakness in Germany.
But London responded readily when the German bond market rallied and,
heartened by a firm opening on Wall Street, which in early dealings appeared
set to maintain its recent strength, the fall in the Footsie was largely
eliminated. The final reading showed the index at 3,481.4, only just under
Friday's all-time closing peak.
Seaq volume slipped to 800.2m shares from Friday's 979.7m, and traders said
that the market was unexciting yesterday. However, Friday's Pounds 2bn total
of retail, or customer, business confirmed that underlying business in
equities remains high. Retail turnover for last week totalled Pounds 10.9bn,
the best weekly figure for several months. High levels of retail volume have
provided the confidence which has enabled the market to extend its gains
since the beginning of the month.
The second line issues represented by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index had another
calmer session, following the hectic activity seen in the middle of last
week. At 4,100.9, the Mid 250 Index was 4.9 off at the close.
Renewed strength in sterling encouraged those investors looking for an early
cut in domestic base rates, and in turn counterbalanced the effects of the
April tax increases which prompted a political squabble at the weekend.
The final picture in the UK market was somewhat mixed, with a handful of
blue chip names buoying a market which appeared very uncertain. Tax
increases are regarded as a serious threat to an economic recovery which
still seems sluggish.
This week brings further trading news from leading retail stores for the
all-important Christmas season. Good results yesterday from John Menzies,
the Edinburgh-based newsagent and stationer, acted as a curtain raiser for
the sector, but were not seen as a guide to such specialised clothing
retailers as Next and Burton, which also report on trading this week.
Most of the financial sectors continued to make progress but there were
signs of profit-taking among the utilities, which have been advancing on
dividend hopes. Consumer shares were mostly lower as investors weighed the
implications of the April tax moves. Food retailers, unsettled afresh by
reports of profit margin pressures, saw some selected selling.

FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures finished on a firm note, having recovered from a sharp
retreat earlier in the session, as turnover in both the futures and traded
options returned to more modest levels, writes Joel Kibazo.
An uneventful opening at 3,493 saw the March contract on the FT-SE 100 come
under pressure as a leading independent (local) firm, said to have been
acting for a US client, executed a large sell order. The overnight plunge in
Tokyo, and the early weakness in other European markets, only served to
encourage further sporadic selling, sending March to a low for the day of
3,463.
However, the completion of the large order and a favourable outlook on the
economy included in the industrial trends survey from the CBI brought a
turnround in the fortunes of the contract, helping March follow the recovery
in the other European markets.
The early rise on Wall street led to further buying of the contract, which
ended at 3,498, up 8 from Friday's close and around 15 points above its fair
value premium to cash of about 7 points. Turnover was 15,238 at the official
close and dealers reported good activity in after-hours' trading.
Volume in the traded options fell back to 33,801 lots from Friday's 54,500
contracts. Some 11,439 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,702 in the
Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Activity in the stock options was light. Rolls-Royce, favoured by US
investors, was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,511 contracts
transacted. It was followed by Guinness at 968, Hanson at 816 and Commercial
Union close behind at 804 lots.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's strong run halted by
program sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip stocks retreated yesterday for the first time in seven sessions
after an afternoon wave of program selling brought a sharp swing in share
prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.69 off at 3,912.79, after crossing
the 3,900 threshold for the first time on Friday. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 extended its loss in late activity, ending down 2.75
at 471.97. The American SE composite shed 1.37 to 483.37 and the Nasdaq
composite 3.63 to 790.65.
New York SE volume came to 298m shares, while declines outscored rises by
1,200 to 903.
With the US Treasury postponing its scheduled budget report because of last
week's weather-related shutdown, investors were free to concentrate on a
fresh batch of corporate results released during the session.
The strength of two stocks - International Business Machines and Caterpillar
 -was sufficient to propel the Dow ahead by as much as 15 points by
midsession. IBM was at centre stage amid growing anticipation that the
computer company would today report its first profit since the second
quarter of 1992. The stock climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 58 5/8 in heavy
trade of 4.2m shares which lifted it to the top of the NYSE's most active
list.
Caterpillar advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 101 1/4 as its strong earnings
report late last week generated continued interest among buyers. The stock
also benefited from an upgrading by Morgan Stanley.
However, with the US Treasury market showing weakness as the afternoon
progressed, most stocks failed to make much headway. Analysts said some
issues slipped in a follow through to gains related to the 'double-witching'
expiration of stock options on Friday.
In the final two hours, the Dow retraced its earlier progress and fell into
negative territory, while the secondary indices broke into full retreat.
Among the exceptions, Reynolds climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 in an
endorsement of its recently announced restructuring. In other basic metal
issues, Alcoa added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 75 5/8 .
Several oil companies posted lacklustre results, but their share prices were
mixed. Texaco put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 66 1/4 , Amoco slipped Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 53 5/8 and Arco receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 106 1/2 .
Chevron, which has yet to report its performance, gained Dollars 1 at
Dollars 92 5/8 .
Computer issues were generally stronger. Computer Associates firmed Dollars
1 1/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 in a rebound from a sharp sell-off last week.
Advanced Micro Devices rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 , while a strong
fourth quarter lifted Unisys by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 .
Profit-taking pushed the Nasdaq down after Friday's record-setting
performance. An exception to the trend was Cyrix, which jumped Dollars 3 3/4
to Dollars 24 1/2 on a report that it had gained ground in a legal battle to
sell clones of Intel computer chips. But Intel edged up Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 65 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto extended its losing streak to three consecutive sessions. The TSE
300 index closed 36.1 down at 4,465.8 and falls led rises by 512 to 303
after volume of 72.4m shares.
The heavily weighted precious metals sector dropped 1.56 per cent on soft
gold prices and a negative report from New York brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin
and Jenrette on the gold industry.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 4.9% after
reform bill rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei average plummeted 4.9 per cent as political uncertainty following
last Friday's rejection of the political reform bill in the upper house
triggered heavy selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index lost 954.19, its biggest one-day drop, to 18,353.24 as
investors and brokers who had bought stock ahead of the vote rushed to
adjust positions. The Topix index of all first section stocks weakened
70.85, or 4.5 per cent, to 1,499.06 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
recovered 5.77 to 1,243.67.
'It was total confusion,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities, describing
the panicky selling which wiped out 4.3 per cent of the market's total
equity capitalisation. However, he added that foreign investors were buying
some of the shares which domestic investment trusts and financial
institutions had unloaded.
The vote in the upper house came after the market had closed last Friday,
stunning investors who had bought heavily in expectation of the bill's
passage.
Overseas buying of Japanese shares this year is believed to be on a medium
to long term investment basis, offering a relatively low risk of selling on
a snap fall in share prices. But an increase in political uncertainty could
stall further support from foreign parts.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that although prospects of
lower interest rates were positive for the stock market, he was cautious on
the short term due to the possibility that the cabinet would be forced to
resign, which would be followed by a general election next month.
The Nikkei opened at the high of the day of 19,294.43 and hit a low of
18,320.33 just before the market closed. More than 80 per cent of first
section stocks were left untraded in the first hour of the session due to
mounting sell orders and lack of buyers.
Volume totalled 360m shares, against 462m. Declines overwhelmed advances by
1,105 to 15, with 17 issues unchanged. Bank shares, which had recently been
firm on arbitrage-linked buying, were among the heaviest losers, with
Industrial Bank of Japan down Y170 to Y3,080.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gave up Y40,000 to Y840,000, ending its
17-day rising streak. East Japan Railway shed Y35,000 to Y461,000.
High-technology stocks faced heavy selling from dealers. Sony retreated Y200
to Y5,660 and Fujitsu Y41 to Y888.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 874.22 to 20,200.56 in volume of 49.8m
shares.
Roundup
If anything, Tokyo's woes diverted funds into other Asian markets, although
some brokers said that an extended fall in Japanese stocks could depress the
region.
BANGKOK forged ahead 3.8 per cent in moderate trading, speculators
concentrating on the finance sector in anticipation of strong 1993 earnings.
The SET index closed 53.13 higher at 1,461.59 in turnover of Bt13.8bn. The
finance sector jumped 7.7 per cent, banks following with a 4 per cent gain.
Brokers said Thai investors dominated trading, with foreigners continuing to
stay on the sidelines. Nava Finance was up Bt18 to Bt226, Asia Securities
Bt11 to Bt128, Dhana Siam Bt44 to Bt578 and Finance One Bt34 to Bt384.
BOMBAY put on 2.7 per cent, rising sharply in the second half of the trading
session on renewed demand from foreign institutional investors. The BSE
index finished at a provisional 3,853.1, up 100.6.
Brokers said there was aggressive buying, particularly by Morgan Stanley,
which recently attracted Rp9bn in a mutual fund offer, and Unit Trust of
India, the country's largest fund of this type.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index ended 36.54, or 1.6 per cent,
stronger at 2,318.27, with institutional buying again in evidence. Jurong
Shipyard moved forward 80 cents to SDollars 14.30, F &amp; N 80 cents to
SDollars 17.50 and Keppel Corp 60 cents to SDollars 11.60.
HONG KONG ended higher, but off its peak after profit-taking had trimmed
early gains. Brokers said Japanese and US investment houses diverted funds
from falling Tokyo stocks into other Asian markets, but profit-taking hit
afternoon trade and the Hang Seng index closed a net 140.72, or 1.2 per
cent, ahead at 11,600.09, down from a morning high of 11,708.56.
Hutchison Whampoa led the market higher on news that it was buying out the
management contract of the Hong Kong Hilton. Investors interpreted the move
as signall-ing that it would cash in on the redevelopment value of the hotel
site and Hutch-ison shares advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 41.
SEOUL saw renewed interest in asset play counters and the composite index
added 10.21 at 887.96. KUALA LUMPUR finished mostly lower on lack of
support, although gains in selected blue chips left the KLSE composite index
0.79 firmer at 1,064.55.
AUSTRALIA lost ground as a softer gold price and the plunging Japanese stock
market encouraged investors to take profits. The All Ordinaries index closed
25.8 down at 2,224.5 in turnover of ADollars 494.8m, gold shares dropping
just over 4 per cent to 2,547.6.
KARACHI ended sharply lower for the third straight session, the KSE index
losing 68.08 to 2,202.21, although it recovered slightly from a fall of
79.04 one hour before the close.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Yen recovers in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen traded in a fairly narrow range yesterday following a sharp
weakening in Asian trading in response to a large stock market sell-off in
Japan, writes Philip Gawith.
The pound, meanwhile, strengthened across the board as the market took cheer
from the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends
survey, which lent support to the view that a non-inflationary economic
recovery is well under way.
After falling sharply in Tokyo, the yen picked up yesterday in UK trading to
finish at Y111.82 to the dollar, compared to Friday's close of Y111.21. The
currency continued to rally in New York, registering a level of Y111.65 at
the close.
The currency's earlier weakness was prompted by the sharp fall in the Nikkei
average of 954 points, or nearly 5 per cent, yesterday, the first trading
day since Japanese political reforms were rejected last Friday.
Opinion is divided about the short-term outlook for the yen. Mr Steve
Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'The yen finds
itself between a rock and a hard place.' On the one hand, US-Japanese trade
talks are at a very sensitive stage. Should they fail, this would be
positive for the yen.
On the other hand, the fall of the stock market and the government's
difficulties are negative for the yen. 'The market has not yet made up its
mind which way the big break is going to be,' said Mr Hannah.
In spite of the government's weak position, some are optimistic that it will
still manage to introduce a stimulatory fiscal package. Mr Paul Chertkow,
head of global currency research at UBS, said there was an underlying market
belief that the government would do a deal to ensure the passage of
political reform and a further fiscal package.
Mr Chertkow calculates that this fourth such package would be around Y10
trillion (million million), bringing the cumulative stimulus to about
Y40trn, or 8 per cent of GDP - 'a huge dose of fiscal medicine'.
While market consensus favours a weakening yen, Mr Mark Austin, treasury
strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the yen could rise in the near
term.
He notes that there is 'no sign (other than in market positioning) of the
capital outflow that would take the yen lower in the face of a still
enormous current account surplus. On the contrary, Japanese investors seem
more likely to repatriate funds, especially as many appear to believe that
the Japanese equity market represents better value than others in the Far
East.'
If the government delays fiscal stimulus, the prospect of lower official
interest rates becomes more likely.
Mr Tony Northfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, notes that with the
Japanese discount rate at 1.75 per cent, and some producer prices falling at
a rate of 3 per cent, real rates for some companies are still quite high.
Sterling rose across the board yesterday after the release of the better
than expected CBI survey.
Analysts said it indicated a further acceleration in output without any
significant increase in inflation. It ended the day at Dollars 1.496 and
DM2.6185, compared with Dollars 1.495 and DM2.6122 on Friday.
The survey showed that orders and output had risen over the past four months
at the strongest rate for nearly five years. Business confidence increased
for the fifth quarter in succession while, for the first time since 1989,
investment intentions show a positive balance with more firms expecting to
increase spending on plant and machinery over the next 12 months.
Mr Hannah at IBJ said the report had been quite helpful to the government in
providing it with ammunition to deflect some of the criticism it is getting
about tax increases. The report, he added, supports the government's
argument that the recovery is strong enough to absorb the planned tax rises.
The market appeared unmoved by the growing political row surrounding the
higher taxes.
The D-Mark edged a little lower against other ERM currencies late yesterday
amid growing speculation of a German interest rate cut. Besides weakening
against the pound, it was also lower against the dollar, which finished at
DM1.7504, compared to Friday's close of DM1.7474. The New York trading
session ended at DM1.7511.
Inflation data from North-Rhine Westphalia, the first state to report
January figures, came in at a better than expected 3.3 per cent
year-on-year, after 3.5 per cent in December. Analysts said that if this
pattern were repeated when other states reported their figures, then there
would be increased pressure on the Bundesbank to reduce rates at next week's
council meeting.
In its money market operations the Bank of England yesterday provided late
assistance of around Pounds 680m.
After forecasting a liquidity shortage of about Pounds 1bn, the Bank
provided the UK money market with Pounds 50m of early assistance. The
central bank bought Pounds 50m of bills for resale to the market on February
9 at the established repo rate of 5 13/32 per cent.
The Bank provided the money market with a further Pounds 12m of assistance
later in the morning and in the afternoon purchased bills totalling Pounds
122m after revising its forecast of the shortage to about Pounds 1.05bn.
These operations were at the established rate of 5 3/8 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals analysts very sceptical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts at a seminar in London yesterday were very sceptical about the
attempts being made to cut aluminium output and their potential impact on
the market.
'Unless consumers are given a very clear indication of what is actually
going to happen in the way of cuts and they are given specific details about
who is going to cut where and when, market sentiment will not change,' said
Mr Ted Arnold of Merrill Lynch.
Mr Neil Buxton of Metal Bulletin Research suggested annual cuts of 1.5m
tonnes were 'totally beyond the industry's reach.' He added: 'I would be
very surprised if there can be agreement on cuts of that size.'
Mr Simon Hunt of Brook Hunt Associates told the 1994 metals market forecasts
seminar, organised by Metal Bulletin and the FutureSource consultancy, that
an agreement might be reached but it would not last long. 'We think an
agreement will be cobbled together but it will not have teeth and in three
months time people will perceive it has no teeth. Meanwhile, the investment
funds will drive up prices and producers will say: Why do we have to cut?'
There were a number of factors working against an aluminium agreement, he
said. European producers were under less pressure because they had been
reducing costs and were now probably breaking even at Dollars 1,100 to
Dollars 1,150 a tonne compared with last night's unchanged three-month price
of Dollars 1,189.50. Also, it was unlikely that Moscow could control the
actions of smelters in remote Siberia. And 'not all the world's aluminium
producers believe this is the best way to deal with the problem of
oversupply.'
However, if there was a 10 per cent reduction in world production (excluding
Alcoa and Alcan which had already made deep cuts) stocks would fall by
700,000 tonnes this year and by 1.5m tonnes in 1995, Mr Hunt suggested.
Without cuts, total industry stocks would rise by 1m tonnes to 6.1m this
year and to 6.3m in 1995, compared with annual western demand of about 16m
tonnes.

Precious metals continued to slide yesterday with London GOLD losing Dollars
5 at Dollars 380.25 a troy ounce and SILVER 12 cents at Dollars 5.08 1/2 an
ounce. Gold found support after fixing at Dollars 378.80, with some
encouragement being taken from the relatively steady tone on the New York
silver futures market.
At the London Commodity Exchange March COFFEE rallied Dollars 12 to Dollars
1,192 a tonne, encouraged by news that Central American producers had set
minimum export prices.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Non-cartel plan studied for
aluminium output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade representatives from the big aluminium producing countries hope they
have found a formula to cut annual global output by another 1.5m to 2m
tonnes without being accused of acting as a cartel.
This is likely to see the Russian industry agree, in perhaps a week, to
reduce its output. Then there would be further cuts by western producers who
have already mothballed more than 1m tonnes of annual capacity.
As no specific targets are to be set for individual western countries, the
trade delegates feel that they will be able to convince anti-trust
authorities in the US and elsewhere that the aluminium industry is reacting
to market forces rather than acting as a cartel aiming to lift aluminium
prices.
'The problem is that, unless some kind of trust can be built up between the
producers, everyone wants to see others make the first cuts,' said one
delegate yesterday. 'We hope we now have a formula to generate that trust,
one that will produce the world-wide cuts necessary to bring the aluminium
market back into balance.'
The formula, in the shape of a memorandum of understanding, was despatched
yesterday by Mr Jorn Keck, the European Commission's external trade
relations commissioner, who should have a clear idea of what is acceptable
after chairing the three-day negotiations in Brussels last week between
representatives from Australia, Canada, the 12-nation EU negotiating as one,
Norway, Russia and the US. Lawyers from the US Justice Department,
responsible for anti-trust matters, were also involved.
The countries have been asked to respond to the memorandum by Friday this
week.
If all then went to plan, production cuts would start shortly afterwards and
would be monitored by the International Primary Aluminium Institute. The
Russian delegates said that their smelters would co-operate by providing
IPAI with statistics and become members of the international data-collecting
organisation. There would be a follow-up, monitoring meeting between the
trade delegates in Canada at the end of February to assess whether the
scheme was working properly.
The Brussels meeting last week was meant to last only two days but was
prolonged at first by Russia's refusal to change its offer to cut output by
300,000 tonnes but only if there were similar reductions in the west. This
offer was too low as far as the US delegates were concerned.
Further delays were caused by wrangling between the US and the EU, mainly
about the import restrictions on aluminium from the Commonwealth of
Independent States imposed by the EU last year and which will not be removed
until the end of February at the earliest. According to one delegate, the EU
and the US eventually agreed that there should be no unilateral trade
restrictions imposed in future but only multilateral solutions should be
sought.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Settlement 'very
disappointing', says Australian supplier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian resources group and the
country's biggest coal producer, yesterday described the magnitude of the
price cuts for coking coal arrived at with the Japanese steel mills after
the annual round of negotiations as 'very disappointing'.
BHP said that hard coking coal prices would fall with effect from April 1.
It added that the tonnage of hard coking to be supplied to the Japanese
steel mills from its Australian coal division would fall to 7m tonnes in
1994-95, compared with 7.9m tonnes in the current year, although it added
that it expected to maintain its total share of overall tonnage purchased by
the mills.
The price of Australian coal has already been cut in annual negotiations in
recent years, under heavy pressure from the buyers.
Yesterday, Mr Geoff Lill, BHP Australia Coal's marketing manager, blamed
international competition and the downturn in Japanese economic activity for
the poor result of the latest haggling session.
'Facing high losses. the JSM (Japanese steel mills) had requested
co-operation from their raw material suppliers in the cost-cutting area,' he
said. '(Our) main competitor, Canada, had attempted to use the opportunity
to build its market share at the expense of Australian producers.'
The weakness of the Canadian dollar, he argued, had allowed Canadian
suppliers to cut prices more substantially without loss of revenue.
'BHPAC estimates that failure to be competitive could have resulted in the
loss of a further 2m tonnes of hard coking coal sales from BHPAC alone, and
that in the final result BHPAC would have been compelled to match prices
offered by Canadian producers,' he added.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese state gold purchases
fall by 40 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's state monopoly over gold took a battering last year with purchases
falling 40 per cent.
That was the first time since the 1970s that gold purchases by the state had
fallen and the slump underlined the increasing reluctance of producers to
yield gold to the state at prices well below those prevailing
internationally.
Mr Ai Dacheng, vice-director of the Gold Bureau under the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry, blamed the slump on official tardiness in raising
the official purchase price.
The People's Bank, China's Central Bank, which holds the monopoly, increased
on 1 September the purchase price to Yn2,986 (USDollars 343) a troy ounce
from Yn1,697, but the official price has not budged since and is more than
10 per cent below the world market.
Mr Ai said gold output was higher in China in 1993 than the previous year,
but did not provide details. China produced about 110 tonnes of gold in
1992. Unofficial estimates put China's in-ground reserves at 3,000 tonnes.
The country's gold miners, fed up with meagre returns from their efforts,
have been selling on the black market for the past year or so to take
advantage of surging demand in China for gold and gold jewellery.
The crumbling of the state monopoly of gold purchasing is certain to fuel
stronger demands for the establishment of an active, government-supervised
gold exchange in China that would enable the metal to be freely traded at
world prices.
But Mr Ai doubted that such a market would be established soon. He described
the issue as 'complicated' and said that the People's Bank was 'not quite
ready' for such a step.
Demand for gold is strong among Chinese consumers anxious to secure a hedge
against inflation which was running at more than 20 per cent in urban
centres late last year.
Figures on demand for gold in China are unreliable since such a large
quantity is being being traded on the black market. In 1992 gold consumption
was put at 250 tonnes, but that almost certainly understated the Chinese
people's appetite for gold.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese steel mills win big
coal price cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coking coal prices crashed in annual renegotiations completed yesterday
between the Japanese Steel Mills and their Australian and Canadian
suppliers.
In a negotiation led by Canada's Fording Coal, which had for weeks been
signalling its willingness to take a large price cut for an increased
tonnage, the hard coking coal price was cut by Dollars 3.85 to Dollars 45.45
a tonne.
The Fording agreement was followed immediately by BHP Australia and
subsequently by seven other big Australian producers. All but one suffered
tonnage cuts. In contrast, Fording is believed to have won a 200,000-tonne
increase in its contract.
Other coal qualities also came down in price with soft coking coal falling
Dollars 3.50 and semi-soft by Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 40.35-42.35 and
Dollars 36.40 a tonne respectively.
The settlement is likely to lead to a rapid conclusion of the steam coal
contracts between the Australian suppliers. Many Australian producers were
saying yesterday that they expected the agreement to be accompanied by a
strike throughout the industry.
In all, eight Australian exporters have signed up at the new prices levels.
BHP, Australia, Arco, MIM, Shell, KCC, South Blackwater, Clutha and a group
of soft coking coal producers shipping out of Newcastle.
The new price levels will push many of the Australian and Canadian
operations into the red and raise questions over the future of a number of
pits in New South Wales. While the Canadian producers have the compensation
of a weakening currency - the Canadian dollar has fallen from 87 to 76 US
cents in the last 12 months, the Australians have no such cushion, with a
slight strengthening of their dollar since the start of 1992. In contrast,
the mills are doubly winners with the stronger yen adding to the weaker
dollar-denominated prices. Since 1991 dollar prices have fallen from Dollars
51.80 to Dollars 45.45 while yen prices have fallen Y6,841 to Y4,912.
Nor will the suffering from the new settlements be restricted to Canada and
Australia as, one way or another, the US exporters will have to match them,
although probably at a lower level. The US industry, which has only recently
returned to full working after a damaging, drawn-out strike, is in no
position to match cuts of this magnitude and it is expected that pressure
will come on to the railroads that carry coal to the export terminals to
make a cut in their freight rates.
The coal producers faced a formidable hurdle in Japan with poor financial
performance at the mills, coupled with an expectation of a fall in steel
production coinciding with the development of new mines in Australia and an
expansion of production at existing Australian and Canadian mines. However,
the overall balance of coking coal demand on international markets presents
a much less gloomy prospect, with demand recovery expected in the US and
almost all the other coking coal buyers in Asia, South America and Europe.
For the Australians, it is particularly ironic that the settlement comes
hard on the heels of the announcement that at the end of December its stocks
reached a five-year low of just 8.7m tonnes.
Although it is clear that the coking coal market is far from robust, the
situation facing the steam coal producers is completely different. Demand is
rising vigorously throughout Asia, led by the construction of
import-dedicated coal plant in Japan. Almost invariably, and particularly in
Japan, these utilities are highly profitable and, far from needing price
cuts, are well able to pay the current year's prices.
Some Japanese power companies were reported to have expressed worries that
any price cuts would have implications for the security of their supply over
the rest of the decade. Such worries will now be put to the test.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario in CDollars 1.25bn global offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CDollars 1.25bn global bond offering for the Canadian Province of Ontario
was the highlight of an otherwise slow day in the Eurobond market.
After record issuance during the first three weeks of the year, syndicate
officials say the market may be in for a period of consolidation in the near
term.
'Everyone is severely long of paper, and I think most of us would like a
pause to digest all the recent supply,' said one official.
Ontario's 30-year global bond met with strong demand and was oversubscribed,
according to its lead managers and the issuer.
'There was tremendous demand in Europe - it came in much stronger than
expected,' said Mr John Madden, assistant deputy minister of finance for the
province.
He said that some 43 per cent of the deal went to Canadian accounts, 16 per
cent flowed into the US, 32 per cent of the issue was bought by European
investors, and the remaining 10 per cent went to Japan and the rest of Asia.
According to one of the lead managers, much of the deal had been pre-placed
last week, ensuring a smooth launch. 'The book was so strong on Friday that
the launch was even brought forward a bit,' he said.
Investors' appetite for Canadian dollar bonds is based on widespread
expectations that Canada's currency and bond market will outperform their US
counterparts.
In addition, the country's positive inflation outlook has increased investor
interest in very long-dated bonds. Standard &amp; Poor's recent confirmation of
the province's AA-minus long-term debt rating also helped boost investor
confidence, traders said.
The bonds ended the day at 98.58 bid, yielding 51.5 basis points over the
corresponding government bond. That was below the 53 basis point launch
spread, which in turn was at the low end of market expectations.
Given the success of yesterday's deal, many syndicate officials now expect
Ontario's planned US dollar global floating-rate note to be launched later
this week.
The issue will be lead-managed by Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, and
traders are calling for Dollars 1.5bn of five-year floating-rate notes
paying a spread of eight to 10 basis points above Libor.
The day's other global bond, a SKr1.5bn five-year offering for the Nordic
Investment Bank via Merrill Lynch, got a more muted reception.
The issue will be priced today at an indicated spread of 10 to 15 basis
points over the corresponding Swedish government bond, with most traders
expecting the launch spread to be towards the upper end of that range.
Given last week's heavy supply of Swedish krona five-year paper, the deal is
likely to be quite slow to get off the ground.
In the D-mark sector, LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance increased its
outstanding issue of DM1.5bn 6.5 per cent bonds due September 2008 by
another DM750m.
The bonds ended the day at 101 bid, up from their 100.60 re-offer price,
lead manager JP Morgan said. The yield spread remained stable at 67 basis
points over bunds.
According to one syndicate official, the D-mark sector is beginning to
benefit from flows out of other so-called core European bond markets, such
as France, Belgium and the Netherlands. 'Germany has underperformed so much
it has become ridiculously cheap,' he said.
In the Eurosterling sector, Rothschild Continuation Finance issued Pounds
125m of perpetual bonds via Hoare Govett, NM Rothschild and Salomon
Brothers. At the re-offer price of 99.989 they yielded 240 basis points over
the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017.
According to one of the lead managers, the paper was taken up mainly by UK
institutions, though some demand from Switzerland was also seen. 'Investors
like the high current coupon and it adds good duration to their portfolios,'
he said.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts rise on expectations of
smooth auction
</HEADLINE>

Long-dated UK government bonds rose about  1/4 point in quiet trading
yesterday in anticipation that tomorrow's Pounds 2.75bn auction of 15-year
stock by the Bank of England would proceed smoothly. By contrast, gains at
the shorter end were limited to about  1/8 point.
The March long gilt future on Liffe traded at 119 13/32 in late trading,
just below the day's best level of 119 27/32 but up  3/16 on the day.
Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said he expected the new stock to yield
around 6.35 per cent, in line with current market levels. He expected the
cover - the amount by which demand exceeds supply - would be around 1 1/2
times, below the record 2.2 times recorded at the last auction.
He said that the cover was likely to be more modest this time round because
market conditions were stable and because traders had already adjusted their
positions ahead of the fresh supply of gilts. He also expected a very small
'tail' - the difference between the average accepted price and the lowest
accepted price.
There was little obvious reaction in the market to the latest survey of
industrial opinion by the Confederation of British Industry despite its
encouraging conclusions on the state of the UK economy.
Better-than-expected January data for January from the German state of
North-Rhein Westphalia sparked an intra-day recovery in German government
bond futures yesterday. The March bund future on Liffe had dropped as low as
99.77 before the data were released but rose as high as 100.18 by
mid-afternoon in good volume. By contrast the cash market was mostly
unchanged in quiet trading, traders said.
Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, German economist at UBS in Frankfurt, said while the
NRW data were encouraging, fears of a poor money supply number for December,
which could be published at the end of this week or early next week, were
dampening market sentiment. The market expects a figure of 7 per cent.
Italian bond futures rallied more than a half-point on news yesterday that
Italy's finance minister, Mr Franco Gallo, had signed a decree to speed up
the refund of a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on bond coupon payments to
eligible foreigners.
The March Italian government bond future on Liffe was trading near the day's
high of 118.96 in late trading, well up on the day's low of 117.93. Some
traders believed that the market would test its previous record high of
119.12 today.
Japanese government bonds showed unexpected resilience in the face of the
current political uncertainty in Tokyo and the slide in the Japanese stock
market yesterday. The March future went as high as 116.29 before closing at
115.95, the day's low, but 0.27 points higher than Friday's close. The
future then drifted to just below 116 in London trading.
Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Europe in London, said the future was
likely to trade between 115.50 and 116.40 in the short term, in the light of
the support shown at 114.50 last week. He added that some investors were
switching out of the benchmark No 157 10-year government bond into other
10-year bonds, following No 157's outperformance of 10 basis points last
week.
US bond prices showed little change yesterday morning in a quiet session
ahead of today's Treasury auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/32 at 99
19/32, yielding 6.292 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
unchanged at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.045 per cent.
The market opened on a weak note after overnight selling by Japanese traders
rattled by the failure of a political reform package to win parliamentary
approval. But prices soon found support in light technical trading, despite
underlying concern over today's influx of supply. The auction is to be
followed by the sale of Dollars 12bn in five-year securities tomorrow.
As the afternoon progresses, the long bond slumped, with uneasiness over
Friday's report on fourth-quarter domestic product beginning to surface.
Traders are concerned that a robust growth rate could carry over into the
first quarter and trigger an early tightening of monetary policy.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Turkish bank in US private
placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust has completed a Dollars 65m US private placement of
certificates backed by credit card receivables serviced by Interbank, the
private Turkish bank.
It is the first time that any Turkish borrower other than the Republic has
tapped the US market and follows a similar offering in the Eurobond market
in 1992, also arranged by Bankers Trust, according to Mr Rahmi Sayder,
vice-president of BT's European asset-backed securities group.
The certificates are issued by Interbank/AKK Trust, a special purpose
vehicle, which has purchased the right to receivables of Eurocard,
MasterCard and Visa credit cards used by foreign tourists and business
travellers in Turkey.
Interbank's wholly owned subsidiary, Anadolu Kredi Karti (AKK), is a market
leader in international credit card processing in Turkey.
The credit card receivables deal allows Interbank to secure medium-term
funding: the deal has a final maturity of five years and a four-year average
life. Bankers Trust declined to disclose the coupon or yield spread paid on
the fixed-rate securities.
The certificates, rated A by US rating agency Duff &amp; Phelps, were placed
with US institutions such as insurance companies, Mr Sayder said.
He added that similar structures, using credit card or other receivables
such as trade receivables, could be used in other countries, for example in
Greece and Eastern Europe. 'This is a great way of mobilising assets which
are not being used,' he said.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: ABB invests Dollars 300m in
Indian operations

<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the international electrical engineering company,
will invest Dollars 300m in its Indian operations over the next two years as
part of a restructuring and technology modernisation programme.
ABB's investment, the largest by a multinational in India's manufacturing
sector since the country embarked on economic reform in 1991, will be in
three areas. Existing plants will be modernised, and new products introduced
and upgraded. A power-plant manufacturing facility will be established, and
a 'green field' unit will be set up, either in Gujarat or in Karnataka, to
manufacture turbines for the power sector, with an investment of more than
Rs2bn (Dollars 64m).
The multinational, which will soon complete its merger with Flakt India, a
Calcutta-based electrical engineering company, will make a series of
strategic alliances, acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures to help it
consolidate its position as a leading electrical engineering company in
India.
ABB has also offered to take over a struggling company, the Durgapur-based
Associated Boilers (ABL), India's second-largest boiler manufacturer. ABL,
formerly ACC Babcock, has accumulated losses of more than Rs1.3bn, and ABB
is planning to pump in 'a large amount of money' to revive the company and
take over management control, pending government approval.
ABB is also seeking permission to part-acquire another company, the
Bangalore-based New Government Electric Factory, an electronics manufacturer
for the power industry which is jointly owned by the Karnataka government
and AEG of Germany.
When the restructuring is complete, ABB's India operations will then be in a
position to challenge the near-monopoly of the state-owned Bharat Heavy
Electricals in the manufacture of power plant equipment.
ABB's annual income in India is expected to increase to at least Rs15bn by
1996-97, more than double the current group turnover of Rs7bn.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: MIM to shed Granges holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIM, the Queensland-based metals group, has told Granges, the
Vancouver-based gold and base metals mining group, that it plans to sell its
37 per cent holding for not less than CDollars 4 a share, writes Nikki Tait.
At that price the sale would raise around CDollars 50m (USDollars 38m) for
MIM which, the Australian company indicated yesterday, would mean a small
capital loss. The Granges stake is currently carried on MIM's balance sheet
at ADollars 61.8m.
MIM shares eased 5 cents to ADollars 2.74 on the news.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Comalco arranges finance for
power station deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comalco, the large integrated aluminium producer which is 67 per cent-owed
by CRA, has succeeded in underwriting a ADollars 625m (USDollars 439m) debt
facility which will partially finance its purchase of the Gladstone Power
Station from the Queensland Electricity Commission.
The deal is is the first financing of a large resources project whose
viability could be affected by an Aboriginal land claim since Australia's
Native Title (Mabo) legislation was passed at the end of last year.
Some observers have seen the transaction as a test case for the
international banking community's attitude towards the new law.
The power station purchase is tied to Comalco's plans to almost double the
output of its aluminium smelter at nearby Boyne Island, and the total
investment in the project has been estimated at around ADollars 1.75bn. The
problem is that a substantial tranche of land in the neighbouring Cape York
Peninsula is subject to a land claim from the Aboriginal Wik people.
This has no immediate bearing on the project, but the land being claimed
does contain deposits which Comalco might wish to use to sustain its bauxite
operations at Weipa, which in turn would supply raw materials to the Boyne
Island smelter.
Yesterday, however, Comalco claimed that the bidding for the funding had
been 'very competitive' and that around ADollars 2bn of underwriting
commitments had been offered in total.
Barclays Bank of the UK has been appointed agent and lead bank for the
limited-recourse debt. The other underwriting banks are Deutsche Bank,
Industrial Bank of Japan, ANZ and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
The financing is scheduled to close by March 31, after which there will be a
general syndication of the debt to other project finance banks.
Comalco did not disclose pricing details, but J. P. Morgan, which is
advising on the project, said last night that 'no premium had been attached
to the funding because of the Mabo situation'.
It has always been questionable whether the cost of project finance would be
affected by the Mabo legislation. Some critics of the government's native
title bill have argued that the legislation's main impact will be to delay
projects while native title claims are sorted out.
'These issues will generally be cleared up before a project goes to
financing,' said one banker yesterday.
Under the Mabo bill, native claims will not be automatically extinguished
where there is a valid mining lease on the land. Such claims will be allowed
to 'co-exist' with a mining lease, and then possibly take over when the
lease expires.
The bill also sets up a system of tribunals for hearing native title claims.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Harsh realities behind the China
obsession - Investment funds can show good returns, but there are pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by the standards of the faddish fund management industry, the obsession
with China funds has been extreme. Last week saw the start of the London
roadshow for the Guangdong Development Fund, which adds at least USDollars
100m to the more than USDollars 3bn that has been pumped into China funds in
the past two years.
China was arguably the investment buzz-word of 1993, as another year of
double-digit economic growth helped fuel a 115 per cent rise in Hong Kong's
Hang Seng Index over the year. But shrewd investors who read the signs early
and invested in China funds have not been particularly well rewarded for
their prescience.
Most equity-orientated China funds had a strong performance last year. Of 25
funds tracked by the fund research company Micropal, the average increase in
net asset value was 68 per cent - but this compared with an average 118 per
cent increase for Hong Kong equity funds, and Hong Kong made up the majority
of all China fund portfolios.
The GT Shenzhen &amp; China fund, the first to feed on demand for equities
linked to the economic revolution in the Pearl River delta, rose 45 per cent
in 1993 - but on a longer-term view, it has increased by only 2 per cent
from July 1992 up to the end of last year.
Direct investment funds, most of which allow a small percentage to be
invested in equities, have generally fared worse. Their time horizons are
clearly longer, but the results must have tested the most patient of fund
managers.
China Assets, the first fund entirely oriented towards direct investment,
languished last night at a 44 per cent discount to the USDollars 1.10 price
of its pre-listing placement in early 1992.
It is these direct investment funds which have caught the imagination of the
institutions, and the past six months have seen offerings from corporations
ranging from Hong Kong listed China investor New World Development, to
massive mainland corporations such as China Merchants and China's aerospace
ministry.
The allure is undeniable. China has been the most dynamic of the emerging
markets over the past decade, and direct investment funds enable investors
to buy on p/e ratios of 4 or 5 into companies which can be listed in China
and Hong Kong on double-digit p/e's. In addition, the China investments
become foreign joint ventures and gain immediate and substantial tax
advantages, and access to bank funding (which has become almost impossible
for mainland companies).
The realities, however, may be harsher. Mr John Bolsover, chief executive of
Baring Asset Management, said: 'It is impossible to underestimate what is
happening in China, but it is going to remain very tough for direct
investment.'
Baring manages the UK-listed China &amp; Eastern Fund, which was launched in
1985 and had a mandate to invest up to 25 per cent of its assets in
China-related venture capital situations. Eighteen months ago it gave up
direct investment because failures significantly out-numbered successes.
Baring decided the fledgling Chinese equity markets offered a more viable
alternative.
One London-based fund manager said: 'In China, they didn't really understand
what we wanted to do, the infrastructure was bad, and the country had its
fair share of crooks. It just wasn't worth it.'
Even with mainland connections, it can be difficult. China Assets, managed
primarily by one of China's leading investment groups, China Venturetech,
got off to a troubled start. One of its first investments, a USDollars 6m
stake in Chinese computer manufacturer Evertech Holdings, was entirely
written off within a year of purchase. With many economists predicting a
return to austerity in China, it could get tougher.
At the other end of the scale, the large Chinese corporations can
undoubtedly offer deals, but there are question marks over their ability to
evaluate investments objectively.
There is the further complexity of how to exit from the deal. There are
stock markets in China, but listing queues are growing and precedence is
based less on quality than on the whims of the authorities.
It is likely that some direct investment funds will be highly successful.
Guangdong Development Fund has got around two standard problems of other
funds - lack of deals and the lag between raising cash and investing it - by
lining up an influential partner (the Guangdong provincial government) and a
number of deals ready to be injected into the fund. These range from a toll
bridge to a malting plant and power station.
But the risks remain. One Hong Kong-based fund manager related how a fund
bought a stake in a pate de foie gras farm in southern China. After
purchasing the business, the investors discovered that there were no
facilities for producing pate, and they were left with no more than a gaggle
of geese. For every winner, there will be many more investments that fail to
produce golden eggs.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Barlow to sell remaining stake
in Randgold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Barlow, the rump of South Africa's former Barlow Rand conglomerate, is
offering to sell by tender its remaining 27 per cent stake in mining
subsidiary Randgold and Exploration as the group puts the finishing touches
to the re-organisation it started last year.
The holding is worth nearly R80m (Dollars 23.5m) at current market prices.
Barlow was South Africa's flagship industrial group before it disposed of
its foods and electronics interests in an unbundling exercise formally
completed earlier this month.
The group has long stated its intention of disposing of Randgold, whose four
marginal gold mines and parcel of mineral rights were not seen as a
long-term investment.
Speculation as to who will pick up the shares on offer centres on S. G.
Warburg subsidiary Mercury Asset Management, which is understood to have
built up a 28 interest in Randgold in recent weeks.
Plans by Randgold management to go ahead with a controversial share
incentive scheme, offering employees stock in the company at a generous
discount to market prices, were significantly amended at the company's
general meeting last week after Mercury said it would oppose the offer.
Randgold's mines turned in a disappointing performance in the quarter to
December, reporting an aggregate R17.29m loss, but as marginal producers
they are highly geared to any significant recovery in gold prices.
Mr Warren Clewlow, Barlow chairman, told shareholders at the group's general
meeting yesterday that the Randgold transaction should be completed next
month.
Talks about selling a large stake in Barlow's computing subsidiary
Persetech, the local distributor of Hitachi equipment, to an outside
consortium were at an advanced stage.
Mr Clewlow added that the reconstituted Barlow - whose interests include UK
subsidiaries Stratford and Bibby, which is on the verge of a London
flotation - traded 'satisfactorily' in the first quarter to end-December
without elaborating further.
On a pro-forma basis, Barlow would have reported pre-tax profit of R578m in
the year to September 30 on sales of R12.3bn compared R763m on sales of
R11.2bn the previous year.

petrochemical stake

<TEXT>
Brazil's 1994 privatisation campaign started slowly yesterday when an
auction of shares in petrochemical company Petroqumica Uniao (PQU) failed to
attract enough buyers.
The auction, which had already been delayed five times and cancelled once,
will be extended to today to try and meet the government's requirement that
75 per cent of the shares on offer be subscribed. Yesterday, bids were
received for only 64 per cent.
According to some observers, the poor response was a ruse by interested
bidders - mainly PQU's customers - to keep the price at the government's
minimum accepted level. Fiercer competition would have pushed the price
upwards from the minimum of Dollars 330m.
The two main bidders yesterday were consortia involving PQU customers,
including Shell, petrol distributor Ipiranga, and Union Carbide. The bidders
have until mid-afternoon today to raise their bids to the necessary level.
PQU is 68 per cent-owned by a subsidiary of Petrobras, the
government-controlled oil monopoly. If today's auction is completed, this
stake will fall to 20 per cent, while employees will take a 10 per cent
holding.

<TEXT>
Beckman Instruments, the US maker of laboratory instruments, is to cut jobs
by 800 worldwide, Reuter reports from Fullerton. The company warned that
more jobs would be affected as the company consolidated facilities and
functions.
The company, which announced a reorganisation last October, recorded a net
loss for 1993 of Dollars 37.6m, or Dollars 1.35 per share, compared with net
income of Dollars 43.8m, or Dollars 1.53, in 1992.
It said the reorganisation would be funded by a Dollars 135m before-tax
restructuring charge to be taken over two years, including a Dollars 20m
charge to be taken in 1994.
The rest of the Dollars 135m restructuring charge was taken in 1993, and
included Dollars 4m for non-cash items.
Beckman said annual before-tax savings from the plan were expected to be
about Dollars 25m in 1994, rising to about Dollars 45m in 1995.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Better margins downstream help
lift net at Texaco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US oil group, recorded a jump in profit margins in its
downstream refining and marketing operations in the final three months of
last year, in part offsetting the effects of a sharp drop in world oil
prices.
Amoco, meanwhile, failed to receive a boost to downstream earnings, though a
steady improvement in its chemicals business helped to make up for some of
the fall in upstream profits.
At Texaco, upstream exploration and production earnings fell by more than
half during the period, to Dollars 150m from Dollars 352m a year before, as
the price of oil plummetted on world markets.
However, downstream operations, which benefit from cheaper oil, reported a
rise in operating earnings, from Dollars 139m to Dollars 220m.
The result, after special charges and tax adjustments, was net income for
the period of Dollars 339m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, compared with Dollars
313m, or Dollars 1.11.
After-tax earnings for the year as whole were Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars
712m, after a number of one-off items. Before special factors, net income
rose by only Dollars 6m, to Dollars 1.13bn.
The results reflect 'strong operational performance in the face of crude oil
prices which weakened significantly in the third and fourth quarters, and
which remain depressed,' said Mr Alfred DeCrade, chairman and chief
executive.
Amoco reported a fall in upstream earnings in the fourth quarter to Dollars
215m, from Dollars 429m the year before. This was before taking into account
a Dollars 120m gain in the latest period from the sale of part of Crestar
Energy.
Refining, marketing and transportation earnings reached Dollars 259m -
buoyed by a Dollars 50m gain from reductions in inventory - from Dollars
202m at the end of 1992.
Chemicals, on the other hand, saw a further improvement on the back of
higher sales and the benefits from earlier cost-cutting. Net income rose to
Dollars 83m from Dollars 18m.
For the quarter as a whole, after one-off items, net income rose to Dollars
584m, or Dollars 1.17, from Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.10, a year earlier.
The 1993 net income rose to Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 850m, before
accounting changes, last time.

<TEXT>
Ciga, Italy's luxury hotel chain, said yesterday it planned to write down
its ordinary capital, from L150.79bn to L57.26bn (Dollars 33.76m), bringing
the value of each ordinary share to about L379, AP-DJ reports from Milan.
Subsequently, shareholders will be issued 30 new ordinary shares for every
79 ordinary shares held, with the aim of bringing the nominal value of each
share back to L1,000. Ciga said its directors would propose the measures to
shareholders at meetings scheduled for February.
Host Marriott of the US, and the UK hotel group Forte are both negotiating
to acquire a controlling stake in Ciga.
Once the ordinary capital write-down and share issue have taken place, Ciga
said it would have total shareholder capital of L91.72bn, equivalent to its
net worth on December 30, 1993.
Although specifics of a capital increase had not yet been decided, the
directors had agreed that a plan to restructure the group could go forward
with a capital increase of approximately L1,100bn.
On Friday it was revealed that Marriott had raised some Dollars 315m in a
share placing and an asset sale, supporting any bid it might make for the
debt-ridden company.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Squeeze on returns ignites paper
prices battle - Publishers and packagers are resisting moves by pulp
producers to charge more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intense struggle is unfolding between the world's pulp and paper
producers and their customers.
The producers are determined - and in many cases desperate - to push through
price increases after more than four years of stagnant or falling returns.
Their customers, as always, are putting up a fight. Hard-pressed newspaper
and magazine publishers are reluctant to accept price increases until they
are more confident of a rebound in advertising. Falling paper prices have
been a key reason - together with declining interest rates - for their
ability to contain losses or restore profitability.
However, early signs suggest the balance of power in the pulp and paper
industry is shifting towards the producers.
The wood pulp market was ignited in early December by disruptions in
supplies of birch logs from Russia, which are used by Scandinavian mills to
produce hardwood pulp.
The firmer tone has, unexpectedly, spread to softwood pulp, with some
European buyers paying USDollars 430 a tonne for northern bleached kraft
pulp, up from Dollars 395 late last year. If these increases hold, they are
likely to trickle down into higher prices for many grades of paper.
Paper prices already show signs of firming. A modest rise in European
newsprint prices (or to be more precise, a cut in discounts), which took
effect at the beginning of January, appears to have stuck.
Even some consumers acknowledge that North American newsprint prices are
likely to edge up in March for the first time in four years, though not by
anywhere near the 11 per cent demanded by producers. Mr Bill Hee, who buys
newsprint for the Gannett newspaper group, says most publishers have been
expecting a price rise of about 5 per cent.
Linerboard, used in corrugated packaging materials, has gone up from about
Dollars 290 to Dollars 315 a tonne in the past three months. Several
producers have announced further price increases from February 1.
Mr John Maine, vice-president at Resource Information Systems, a
Virginia-based consultancy, predicts prices of most grades of paper will
climb by about 5 per cent in North America this year, with an increase as
high as 8 per cent for strong-growth products such as uncoated business
papers.
Mr Denis Christie, analyst at James Capel in London, forecasts price rises
as high as 10 per cent in European countries where weak currencies push up
import costs.
These views are mirrored in the share prices of leading pulp and paper
producers.
Since the New Year, International Paper, the biggest North American paper
company, has bounced up from Dollars 67.75 to Dollars 74 3/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Abitibi-Price, the Canadian newsprint producer, has jumped
from around Dollars 9 at the beginning of December to Dollars 12.75.
Nevertheless, the recovery remains shaky. 'The market is still not as rosy
as we thought it would be,' says Mr Mark Gibson, vice-president for paper
marketing at Fletcher Challenge Canada. Mr Gibson adds: 'we're still running
into a barrier' in efforts to raise newsprint prices.
The slump in the Japanese economy has cut paper exports from the west coast
of North America, encouraging mills to dump more material into the domestic
US and Canadian markets.
Mr Barry Minerth, director of printing and paper at Time Inc, the US
magazine publisher, acknowledges that 'all the producers are feeling an
extraordinary need to try and increase prices'.
However, he says that magazine advertising has yet to stage a firm rebound.
'I think we've convinced people that to try and put forth a price increase
at this time is not a wise idea.'
If the North American producers are overly ambitious in pushing up prices,
they risk driving customers into the arms of Finnish and Swedish suppliers.
Scandinavian mills have become increasingly aggressive in foreign markets as
their currencies have tumbled over the past 18 months. Rising demand for
paper as European and North American economies expand is only part of the
reason for producers' cautious optimism.
Mr Maine forecasts that newsprint sales volumes will rise by between only 1
and 2 per cent in North America this year. However, he believes that should
be enough to make a price increase stick, given tightening supply prospects.
Pulp and paper markets have been bedevilled for the past four years by
producers' inability to hold down capacity. Many paper machines have been
closed down for months at a time, only to be restarted at the first sign of
a pick-up in sales.
Some mills have even raised capacity at relatively low cost, for instance,
by increasing the operating speed of their machines.
However, producers, especially in Canada where paper machines are older and
smaller than in the US and Scandinavia, are under growing pressure to face
reality. 'A lot of the banks are losing patience,' says Mr Gibson.
Prices for some grades, notably newsprint and uncoated groundwood papers,
are insufficient to cover either normal fixed and operating costs, or the
expensive investments required to meet increasingly stringent environmental
standards, such as higher content of recycled paper, lower dioxin emissions,
and reductions in the use of chlorine as a bleaching agent.
The pressures are vividly illustrated by the new Gold River newsprint mill
in British Columbia, jointly owned by Canadian Pacific Forest Products and a
group of US publishers.
The mill, with an annual capacity of 200,000 tonnes a year, failed to
re-open after the Christmas holidays after the owners and their lenders were
unable to agree on terms for a short-term funding package. Other
hard-pressed producers may find themselves in a similar plight as 1994
progresses.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Profits surge ahead at US
brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits at Merrill Lynch and two other broking firms surged in the
last quarter of 1993, setting the seal on a record year for the US broking
industry.
Commissions and investment banking fees led the rise in revenues in the
latest period, as trading volumes on the New York Stock Exchange surged to a
peak and companies rushed to raise new equity and debt finance.
By contrast, income from principal (or own-account) trading, which had been
a big cause of profit growth earlier in the year, fell slightly in the final
three months from the previous quarter. Principal trading has been viewed by
investors as a volatile source of earnings.
Merrill reported net income in the final quarter of Dollars 347m, compared
with Dollars 221m the year before. For the year as a whole, net income
reached Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 5.98 a share, up from Dollars 893m, or
Dollars 3.92 a share, the year before.
Smith Barney Shearson, created when Travelers (formerly known as Primerica)
bought the Shearson retail broking firm from American Express last year,
reported net income of Dollars 145.1m in the final quarter of last year, up
from Dollars 118.8m in the previous three months (though the preceding
quarter only included two months of figures for Shearson).
The brokers' figures were bolstered by record turnover levels on the New
York Stock Exchange at the end of last year, with commission income at
Merrill rising to Dollars 805m from Dollars 690m in the preceding three
months. At Shearson, it rose to Dollars 543m from Dollars 407m in the
previous period.
PaineWebber also reported solid growth in commissions, rising to Dollars
265m in the quarter, from Dollars 248m in the previous three months and
Dollars 205m a year before. The rise helped push net income at PaineWebber
to Dollars 56.9m, or Dollars 1.08 a share, from Dollars 41.4m, or 73 cents a
share, the year before.
All three firms also benefitted from a rise in investment banking fees,
which at Merrill jumped to Dollars 520m from Dollars 452m in the third
quarter, at Smith Barney rose to Dollars 217m from Dollars 200m and at
PaineWebber climbed to Dollars 114m from Dollars 101m. Asset management fees
rose to Dollars 165m from Dollars 109m at Smith Barney, to Dollars 91m from
Dollars 83m at PaineWebber and to Dollars 418m from Dollars 250m at Merrill.
By contrast, income from principal (or own-account) trading at Merrill fell
to Dollars 675m from Dollars 732m in the previous quarter, while at
PaineWebber it fell to Dollars 185m from Dollars 210m.
The Smith Barney Shearson results helped to push Travelers' net income for
the fourth quarter to Dollars 297.9m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, from Dollars
258.7m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, the previous quarter.
For the year as a whole, Travelers' net income was Dollars 915m, or 3.88 a
share, up from Dollars 728m, or Dollars 3.35 a share. Stripping out the
effects of accounting changes and other one-off factors, net income rose to
Dollars 942m from Dollars 621m. Year-ago comparisons are distorted by the
acquisition of Shearson.
Travelers' figures do not include the results of the Travelers' insurance
company, which was absorbed by Primerica at the start of this year and from
which the company has taken its name. The whole group will report figures
jointly from the first quarter of this year.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Price war hits American Brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Brands, the US cigarettes, spirits and consumer products group,
said the price war in the US cigarette market was mainly responsible for a
20 per cent fall in fourth-quarter pre-tax profits to Dollars 187.4m. It
also blamed fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily sterling, which it
said were responsible for Dollars 10m of the profits downturn.
Fourth-quarter turnover was up slightly to Dollars 3.82bn from Dollars
3.77bn, while earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.15 to 92 cents. For the
full year, turnover fell to Dollars 13.7bn from Dollars 14.6bn, while net
income fell to Dollars 668.2m from Dollars 883.8m before a charge for
accounting adjustments of Dollars 198m. Earnings per share fell to Dollars
3.30 from Dollars 4.29 before adjustment and to Dollars 2.32 after
adjustment.
Results from non-tobacco operations were up 26 per cent for the quarter and
11 per cent for the year, the company said, but this did not compensate for
sharp price cuts in the domestic cigarette market.
The company said US tobacco operations had contributed Dollars 11m to
results in the fourth quarter and that results in the first half of the
current year were unlikely to compare favourably with last year. However, it
expected their full-year contribution to be roughly the same as last year's.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Charge of Dollars 203m puts
Corning Dollars 121m in red

<TEXT>
Corning, the US glass and high-technology manufacturer, yesterday revealed a
fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 120.9m after taking a Dollars 203m charge
related to breast-implant litigation.
The provision represents the company's share of the best estimate so far of
the costs associated with thousands of lawsuits brought by women who claim
to have been injured as a result of silicone implants supplied by Dow
Corning, a joint venture with Dow Chemical.
If special charges were excluded, the company would have posted net income
of Dollars 82.2m, or 42 cents a share, up slightly from Dollars 79.9m, or 42
cents, in the corresponding period of 1992-1993.
Including extraordinary items, earnings were Dollars 41.2m, or 21 cents, a
year earlier.
Corning's share price, which had recovered somewhat after dipping as low as
Dollars 26 last autumn, dropped Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 31 1/8
yesterday.
The company attributed its flat performance to lower prices and the impact
of sluggish worldwide economic conditions on its consumer products business
and other facets of its operations.
The kitchenware division, Corning's original business, has struggled for
years, while fibre optics and medical products and services have assumed
increasing importance to its bottom line.
The trend was evident in sales during the most recent quarter.
Revenues were up 8.7 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn, but growth primarily
reflected the acquisition of Damon, a clinical testing business, and Costar,
a plastic laboratory equipment concern, in the second half.
For the full year, Corning turned in a net loss of Dollars 15.2m, or 9 cents
a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 12.6m, or 8 cents, a year
earlier.
Net sales were Dollars 4bn, an 8 per cent improvement from 1992-1993, when
revenues reached Dollars 3.7bn.

A consortium of Canadian companies - including cable group Videotron and the
National Bank of Canada - yesterday announced plans to launch an
interactive, multi-media home communications system in Quebec, in
partnership with America's privately-owned Hearst Corporation.
The consortium is led by Le Groupe Videotron, one of Canada's leading cable
businesses, which has over 1m subscribers in Quebec and has been providing
first generation interactive services to subscribers in Montreal and
Britain.
The new system will offer consumers interactive services ranging from home
banking - including the ability to transfer money from an account to a debit
card - to home shopping and purchase of lottery tickets.
Hearst, which will have a 10 per cent stake in the venture, will provide
electronic business and yellow pages information directories, as well as
some shopping services. The project, costing CDollars 200m (USDollars 152m),
will deploy 34,000 home terminals in the Saguenay region of Quebec in 1995.

Reynolds Metals company, the US aluminium processor, suffered a
fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 19.1m, or 31 cents a share, before
special charges, despite improvement in western world aluminium demand and
year-on-year gains in its own aluminium shipments.
The loss compares with an operating profit of Dollars 2.9m, or 5 cents a
share, in last year's fourth quarter, also before special charges. Including
charges, the loss was Dollars 238.6m, or Dollars 3.98 a share, compared with
a loss of Dollars 155m, or Dollars 2.55 a share. Sales for the quarter were
Dollars 1.35bn, almost unchanged from a year earlier.
For the year, operating losses were Dollars 94.6m, or Dollars 1.58 a share,
before charges, on revenues of Dollars 5.29bn, compared with income before
charges of Dollars 44.6m, or 75 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.66bn

results from Unisys
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unisys, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported solid
fourth-quarter results, boosted by growth in the US. However, revenues
declined in Europe and Japan.
The company said growth in orders from US commercial customers was at the
highest level for five years. Orders also increased in the Asian and Latin
American markets but declined 'substantially' in Europe.
In the fourth quarter Unisys reported net income of Dollars 117.7m, or 46
cents per share. In the same period a year ago net income was Dollars
139.2m, or 58 cents per share, including special items of Dollars 38m, or 15
cents per share, from accounting changes.
Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 10.9 per cent from
10.1 per cent a year earlier.
Revenue of Dollars 2.1bn in the fourth quarter was higher than expected, but
below last year's Dollars 2.26bn, the company said.
For the year, net income was Dollars 565.4m, or Dollars 2.31 cents,
including Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents, from special one-time items. In the
previous year, Unisys recorded net income of Dollars 361.2m, or Dollars 1.40
per share, which included a special item of Dollars 65m, or 36 cents.
Excluding the special items, earnings per share for the year were Dollars
1.48, against Dollars 1.04 in 1992.
Revenue declined to Dollars 7.74bn for 1993 from Dollars 8.42bn in 1992.
Higher revenues in US commercial business were more than offset by declines
in Europe and Japan, the company said.
'We clearly achieved one of the best financial performances in our industry
and are very pleased with our year-end results,' said Mr James Unruh, Unisys
chairman and chief executive.
'We had a very strong fourth quarter with good order growth and an improved
operating margin. For the year, net income was up 22 per cent excluding
gains from special one-time items.
'Operating income as a percent of revenue for the year was 9.5 per cent,
compared with 8.6 per cent a year earlier. Cash flow from operations again
exceeded Dollars 1bn and we reduced net debt by more than Dollars 500m.
'Financially, our 1994 goal is to achieve further improvement in
profitability and to continue to strengthen the company's capital
structure,' Mr Unruh said.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Boeing parades twin-engine
widebody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing's new 777 twin-engine widebody airliner, photographed here for the
first time, has just made its maiden ground voyage - across the factory
floor of Boeing's huge Everett facility north of Seattle.
The formal roll-out of the completed aircraft will take place in April with
first delivery to United Airlines in May 1995.
The 777, with a price tag of around Dollars 130m, is the biggest twin-engine
widebody ever developed, at a cost of around Dollars 4bn. It is powered by a
new generation of very large thrust engines developed by General Electric
and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US and the UK Rolls-Royce group.
The aircraft, with seating capacity ranging from 320 to more than 400
passengers depending on cabin configuration, is challenging the Airbus A340
four engine and Airbus A330 twin-engine widebody airliners as well as the
McDonnell Douglas three engine MD11.
Boeing has won 147 firm orders for the 777 and options for an additional 108
since the programme was launched in October 1990.

Reynolds Metals company, the US aluminium processor, had a fourth-quarter
operating loss of Dollars 19.1m, or 31 cents a share, before special
charges, despite improvement in western world aluminium demand and
year-over-year gains in its own aluminium shipments.
The loss compares with an operating profit of Dollars 2.9m, or 5 cents a
share, in last year's fourth quarter, also before special charges. Including
charges, the loss was Dollars 238.6m, or Dollars 3.98 a share, compared with
a loss of Dollars 155m, or Dollars 2.55 a share, a year ago.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 1.35bn, nearly unchanged from a year
earlier.
For the year, the company had operating losses of Dollars 94.6m, or Dollars
1.58 a share, before special charges, on revenues of Dollars 5.29bn.
This compares with income before charges of Dollars 44.6m, or 75 cents a
share, on revenues of Dollars 5.66bn in fiscal 1992.
Mr Richard Holder, chairman, said: 'Reynolds' results for the fourth quarter
and the year reflect a continuation of one of the most difficult periods in
the history of the aluminium industry.
'The problem is the severity of the world aluminium supply-demand imbalance,
which escalated in 1993 and drove ingot prices to historic lows, on an
inflation-adjusted basis.'
Mr Holder said that lower ingot prices rippled through a broad range of
fabricated product prices.
'The primary factor in the supply-demand imbalance continued to be CIS
exports, which increased an estimated 1.7m metric tons in 1993, compared to
1.2m in 1992, and only 250,000 as recently as 1989,' Mr Holder said.
The world's largest aluminium producting countries met in Brussels last week
to discuss solutions to the metal glut.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney excites US appetites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the financially crippled leisure group, faces the new threat of
a growing secondary market in its debt following the sale at a 'distressed'
price of a second parcel of its loans by one of the original creditors.
The transaction, believed to have been concluded last week, follows the sale
earlier this month of a FFr130m (Dollars 22.26m) portion of debt by Midland
Bank. The second deal, according to market sources, involved less than
FFr100m of loans and was struck at around 60 per cent of the original value,
roughly the same price as the first sale.
US institutional investors have identified Euro Disney, which is completing
an emergency financial restructuring, as a long-term recovery stock.
Analysts reported strong demand for Euro Disney loans on the buoyant US
secondary debt market.
M. J. Whitman, a New York-based debt broker, is today staging a presentation
in Paris for Euro Disney's creditor banks in the hope of persuading them to
sell their debt for a 'distressed' price to its clients. It expects 20 of
the 60 banks to attend.
'There is considerable interest in Euro Disney loans on the secondary
market,' said Mr Andrew Arthur, Whitman managing director. 'This market is
well developed in the US but still embryonic in Europe. We want to explain
the nature of the market to the banks.'
Mr Arthur claimed that Whitman had already identified prospective purchasers
for 'more than half' of Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net debt. Other secondary
debt specialists confirmed high interest among US investors.
Another US debt broker said: 'There's a real shortage of interesting
distressed investments right now. That's why Euro Disney seems so
attractive. The only problem is persuading the original creditors to sell.'
But further selling of Euro Disney debt could imperil the restructuring by
destabilising the negotiating process.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: SAS recruits new chief from
Ericsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jan Stenberg yesterday agreed to become chief executive of Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS) from April 1.
His appointment comes just two months after the collapse of SAS's ambitious
attempt to merge with three other European airlines - the so-called Alcazar
project - and as the carrier is facing new restructuring to stem heavy
losses.
Mr Stenberg will succeed Mr Jan Reinas, who became SAS's stop-gap chief
executive last September following the resignation of Mr Jan Carlzon. Mr
Carlzon stepped down after 12 years to devote all his energies to bringing
Alcazar to fruition and said he would not return if the plan failed.
Mr Stenberg, 54, has spent his entire career at Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications group. He is Ericsson executive vice-president and a
member of the corporate executive committee.
SAS will be hoping that Mr Stenberg's extensive involvement in Ericsson's
internal restructuring during the 1980s will compensate for his lack of
experience within the international airline business.
The airline is aiming to cut costs by up to SKr2.5bn (Dollars 309m) as part
of a plan to restore profitability and strengthen its financial position. It
suffered a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss in the first nine months of 1993, but
hopes its overall deficit for the year will be slightly lower than the
SKr743m loss in 1992.
Mr Stenberg said his first priority would be to drive through the
rationalisation programme already outlined. This will include job losses,
sale of aircraft, route closures and the disposal of non-core businesses.
SAS will focus closely on its core flying operations, the new chief
executive said. This will see it move away from the diversification strategy
espoused by Mr Carlzon when the group's activities spread to include hotels,
tours and catering. 'I have a vision of SAS as a profitable airline both
within Scandinavia and beyond it,' he said.
He also said the search for collaboration with other airlines would continue
in response to industry pressures. In particular, he highlighted a possible
deepening of co-operation with Swissair and Austrian Airlines, the group's
two partners in the so-called European Quality Alliance. Alcazar envisaged a
full merger with Swissair, Austrian and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: UAP head lowers profits forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, the next
candidate for privatisation by the French government, yesterday warned that
the group's 1993 net profits were at the lower end of expectations at around
FFr1.5bn (Dollars 250m).
UAP, France's largest insurer and due within the next few weeks be sold off,
had previously forecast net profits of between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn for last
year.
However, Mr Friedmann, a senior bureaucrat andclose friend of Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, and who last autumn became chairman of UAP
following the departure of Mr Jean Peyrelevade to the Credit Lyonnais
banking group, told shareholders in Paris that its 1993 net profits would be
'in the region of FFr1.5bn'.
UAP, like other French insurers, in recent years has been badly affected by
the competitive state of the insurance market and by the impact of the
economic recession on its property holdings and banking interests. One of
its main problems has been the poor performance of Banque Worms, its
loss-making banking subsidiary.
Net profits peaked at FFr4.22bn in 1990, but fell to FFr3.77bn in 1991 and
to FFr1.08bn in 1992. It has already reported a modest increase in interim
net profits to FFr1.09bn for the first half of last year.
However, UAP's recovery was checked in the closing months of 1993. 'The main
problems seem to have been the performance of Banque Worms and the potential
losses associated with the recent flooding in northern France,' said Mr
Derek Elias, European insurance analyst at Paribas in London.
Analysts are confident that UAP will see more robust profits growth this
year, albeit to a total well below its 1990 and 1991 levels. Mr Elias said
it should benefit from the recent rise in insurance premiums in France.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Luxottica sees a vision of world
domination  - The expansion plans of Italy's leading maker of spectacle
frames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By  HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few Italians would recognise Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio if they met him in the
street. Yet mention his name and most would immediately recall the modest
man from a Milan orphanage who is Italy's biggest taxpayer.
Luxottica, his company, is the world's leading maker of spectacle frames.
Its international market share is estimated at almost 9 per cent. One in
five Americans who wear glasses is a customer. In Italy, the proportion is
one in three. Though the business may seem mundane, margins are high enough
to generate net profits of L67.5bn on sales of L523bn in 1992.
Results for 1993 should be even better when released next early month.
Boosted by the lira devaluation, sales rose by about 24 per cent to more
than L640bn (Dollars 375m), while net profits should maintain the 12 per
cent growth of the previous year - in spite of recession. About
three-quarters of output is exported.
The surge in profits and turnover, which grew 8 per cent even allowing for
exchange rate changes, should also be reflected in the dividend, likely to
rise in proportion to earnings, says Mr Del Vecchio, Luxottica's founder and
controlling shareholder.
Such buoyant figures, continuing a steady growth since the company listed 25
per cent of its shares in the US in 1990, help to explain why Luxottica
remains among Italian analysts' preferred stocks.
Its prestige may grow even more if Mr Del Vecchio pulls off a number of
acquisitions believed to be in the pipeline. Although he declines to
identify the candidates, Luxottica's strong balance sheet leaves it well
placed to reinforce its international dominance through further takeovers.
Recognising the need for integration in a traditionally fragmented business
has been Luxottica's trump card. The world market for spectacle frames is
divided among dozens of companies. Now, four, led by Luxottica, which
produced 10.4m pairs in 1992, head the pack, with a myriad of smaller
manufacturers dividing the rest of the market between them.
Many smaller players seem destined to disappear as other manufacturers
follow Luxottica's path. Beginning as a sub-contractor of
delicately-engineered spectacle parts, it gradually encompassed the entire
manufacturing process for glasses in metal and plastic and wholesale
distribution in large markets.
Its international position has been consolidated by acquiring local
distributors or setting up its own distribution arm where necessary. That
has helped it capture about 22 per cent of the market in Canada, 9 per cent
in the UK and 6 per cent in France.
Early recognition of the trend towards more expensive 'designer-label'
eyewear has been its other asset.
While cheaper eyewear was left to low-cost Asian producers, it was only in
the mid-1980s that the market for dearer, Dollars 100-Dollars 350 designer
brands, was developed. Luxottica makes glasses under licence for seven
design labels, including leading lights such as Armani and Valentino.
Expansion of the core range has been accompanied by a diversification into
sunglasses. They now account for 24 per cent of sales, up from 10 per cent
when introduced five years ago.
Mr Del Vecchio denies sales and profits may have peaked. Demand in the US,
the biggest market, continues to grow. Meanwhile, spectacle-wearing in other
countries, even western Europe, is not up to US levels, while there is huge
untapped potential elsewhere, he argues. Demographics help: as populations
have grown older with improved medical care, the need for corrective lenses
has increased steadily.
He is also convinced the industry is set for further rationalisation. The
recession has accelerated the shake-out, he believes. 'Those companies which
were badly managed in terms of production and distribution, or were in poor
financial shape, have seen profits fall,' he says.
Mr Del Vecchio says gaining exclusive distribution was vital to raising
sales so sharply in the US. The focus is now on repeating that in other
developed countries where Luxottica's market share is still only about 2-4
per cent and can at least be doubled, he believes.
Product diversification is also on the cards. The designer brands still have
room for further development, he believes. Expansion into branded
sunglasses, which now account for 24 per cent of turnover, also seems
likely.
The challenge of contact lenses - once thought insuperable - is also
dismissed. The main reason why 98 per cent of US spectacles have to come
from abroad is that domestic manufacturers believed in the late 1960s that
traditional glasses had no future and concentrated instead on contact
lenses. 'Experience has shown people want both,' he says.
But perhaps the best measure of confidence in Mr Del Vecchio comes not from
the chairman or the analysts who regularly tip Luxottica's stock. As part of
the licensing deal with Armani, Mr del Vecchio included a 2 per cent stake
in the company. Since then, Mr Armani is believed to have purchased further
stock, taking his holding to almost 5 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Portuguese financial group gains
control of three dairy companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Espirito Santo, the Portuguese financial group, yesterday won control of a
leading dairy group in the country's first leveraged buy-out to be
syndicated in Europe. The operation involved the issue of Es14bn (Dollars
79m) in acquisition debt.
Laque-Industria de Laticinios e Queijo, controlled by the Espirito Santo
group, bought a controlling stake in Lacto, a group of three diary
companies, in one the biggest corporate buy-outs ever made in Portugal.
Bankers Trust, the US investment bank, arranged and underwrote the operation
in co-operation with Portugal's Banco Totta e Acores and Banco de Fomento e
Exterior.
The purchase price has not been revealed but the acquisition debt issued
totalled Es14bn.
The buy-out entailed the transfer of close to 100 per cent of the
outstanding shares of Lacto Acoreana, Lacto Lima and Lacto Lusa, the
companies that make up the Lacto group, previously in the hands of some 300
shareholders.
The Lacto group is one of Portugal's biggest privately-held food companies,
with 1992 sales of Es13bn.
Laque, wholly owned by Lacto Holding, is controlled by Espirito Santo
Development Capital Investors. ESDCI plans to centralise the marketing,
sales, production and logistics of the Lacto group and put a new management
in place.
'The structure of the buy-out is innovative in stripping out the risk
portion of the funding. This makes the syndication attractive to both
Portuguese and foreign financial institutions,' said a spokesman for Bankers
Trust.
The operation also involves an interest rate derivative to protect Laque
against any rise in Portuguese interest rates.

FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Norwegian banks in merger talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, two of Norway's biggest banks, have opened
talks on a proposed merger, leading to one of the biggest rationalisations
of Norway's troubled banking sector since it plunged into a loan loss crisis
at the turn of the decade.
The banks said Fokus, the smaller of the two, had initiated the talks
following a decision to assess the alternatives to remaining free-standing.
Fokus, which was taken over by the state in 1991, was among the hardest hit
banks and remains burdened by credit losses despite a sharply improved
performance during 1993 which resulted in a NKr246.8m (Dollars 32.83m)
profit in the first nine months.
A merger with Christiania, itself still 69 per cent owned by the state, is
understood to be one of the options for streamlining the banking system in a
confidential report commissioned by the authorities from Davis International
Banking Consultants of the UK.
However, a report in a Norwegian business newspaper yesterday said an Oslo
brokerage house was working on an alternative proposal whereby Fokus would
be kept independent through a NKr500m recapitalisation package raised from a
group of domestic and foreign investors.
Orkla Finans, said to be the broker involved, refused to comment yesterday.
Christiania Bank, the country's second largest by asset value, said it and
Fokus saw the potential for a broadly-based bank with strong regional
connections. Fokus is concentrated along Norway's west coast, with its head
office in Trondheim.
A merger would be the biggest since Den norske Creditbank and Bergen Bank
were merged to form Den norske Bank in 1990. But Christiania, which last
month launched a share issue as part of its re-privatisation process,
stressed the talks with Fokus were at an early stage and were being
conducted on a commercial basis, without interference from the state
authorities.
Christiania said it was too early to say how long the talks would take, or
what the conclusion would be. Analysts said a merger would effectively
amount to a takeover of Fokus by Christiania. They estimated the price of
Fokus at around NKr1bn.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Principality BS climbs to Pounds 18.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Principality, the first building society to publish its results for the year
to end-December 1993, yesterday announced an increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 17m to Pounds 18.7m.
The society, the 24th largest in the UK, attributed much of the improvement
to its continuing low level of bad debts, which was reflected in provisions
of Pounds 1.5m for the third successive year.
Total assets rose to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.12bn).
Mr John Mitchell, chief executive, said that the policy of centralised
decision-making on mortgage lending had given it a high-quality mortgage
book, and the consequent low charge for bad and doubtful debts enabled it to
offer competitive rates to savers and borrowers.
After a year in which the sector met fierce competition for customers'
savings, Principality's retail investment balances amounted to Pounds 942m
at the end of the year, compared with Pounds 869m 12 months earlier.
The number of mortgage arrears fell from 5 per cent of live accounts to 4.35
per cent last year.
Peter Alan, the estate agent subsidiary acquired in 1987, made a pre-tax
profit for the third consecutive year, passing Pounds 500,000 for the first
time.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: British Bloodstock cuts loss to Pounds
0.21m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 213,000 were reported by The British
Bloodstock Agency for the half year to September 30, largely as a result of
the continuing cost reduction programme. Losses last time were Pounds
311,000.
Gross revenue fell to Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 9.99m) while turnover rose to
Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 1.67m). Losses per share were cut to 5.5p (8.1p).
Mr Christo Philipson, chairman, said the bloodstock market was
strengthening. However, he did not expect any dramatic improvement in
results, largely because of the erosion in margins resulting from increased
competition.
The USM-traded company is principally involved with the purchase and sale,
as agents, of bloodstock, stallion shares and nominations, as well as the
management, insurance and shipping of bloodstock.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant stake placed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goode Durrant said it was pleased that a 25 per cent hostile stake in the
industrial holding company had been placed in the market.
No price was disclosed, but it seems likely the shares were placed at a
small discount to yesterday's unchanged closing price of 165p.
The stake had been held by Winnedael, the South African company owned by the
Nash family, which had pushed unsuccessfully for representation on the
board.
Winnedael had criticised Goode Durrant for diversifying too much and urged
it to focus on core businesses. Goode Durrant this month reported a recovery
in interim profits from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 4.29m, boosted partly by the
sale of its Laidlaw motor distribution subsidiary last June.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Leeds board defeats bid by dissidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Leeds Permanent building society yesterday defeated an attempt
by dissident members to elect their own candidates to be involved in running
the society.
At the society's annual general meeting, the three board candidates who were
standing for re-election were returned by substantial margins. Mr Roger
Boyes, finance director, and his two colleagues achieved votes of
70,000-plus.
The three other candidates attracted votes of over 26,000, suggesting that
an element among the members is dissatisfied and wants greater recognition
that the society is a mutual organisation.
Leeds is the UK's fifth largest society, with total assets of Pounds 18bn.
Last November, Leeds reported a rise in pre-tax profits of 22 per cent,
taking its figure for the year to end-September to Pounds 186m.
A special resolution put forward by Dr Ken Craven, one of the independent
candidates, which would have made it easier to stand for election to the
board, was also defeated.
The meeting, attended by around 300 members, heard Mr Malcolm Barr,
chairman, say that he hoped to make an announcement within the next few
months about the appointment of a new chief executive.
The post has been vacant since the departure last February of Mr Mike
Blackburn, now chief executive of Halifax, the UK's largest society.
The Leeds' search has been prolonged by the merger talks with National &amp;
Provincial. The deal, announced in August and abandoned in October, would
have seen Mr David O'Brien, N&amp;P's chief executive, as chief executive for
the merged society.
Separately, Leeds confirmed yesterday that Mr Peter Green, head of its
Treasury operation, is to leave the society to take up a job elsewhere. It
hopes to announce a new appointment very shortly.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Profits rise gives boost to Mitie shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mitie Group rose 14p to 337p after the building maintenance
company announced a 47 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six
months to end-September.
On turnover up 31 per cent at Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 35.6m), profits advanced
from Pounds 943,000 to Pounds 1.39m. Earnings per share improved to 7.2p
(5.7p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.5p to 2p.
The advance was helped by a fall in interest payments from Pounds 126,000 to
Pounds 17,000. The figures excluded a contribution from Olscot, the Scottish
cleaning company, the acquisition of which was completed on September 30.
Mr David Telling, chairman, said that all group companies had performed well
despite the difficult economic environment. The turnround in the fortunes of
the cleaning activity in the south-east of England had continued and was an
important factor in the profit improvement.
Mr Telling added that there were indications that trading conditions would
improve in 1994 and the board was confident 'of further significant
progress' in the second half.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Taking stock of the in-store format - A US
investment house is backing WEW's expansion plans.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's change of title by Amber Day Holdings to WEW Group - named
after the discount retailer's chain of stores, What Everyone Wants - was
billed as marking 'a clear separation with the past'.
That aspiration was all too understandable. The Glasgow-based company has
recently been dogged by boardroom turmoil - with three chairmen in the last
16 months - and in November Pounds 9m of provisions and write-offs left the
balance sheet sadly depleted.
However, WEW might at last be entering a period of greater stability. A
placing and Pounds 15.5m rights issue last month allowed Warburg Pincus, the
US investment institution, to raise its stake in the group from 17 per cent
to 25 per cent.
The US investment house, which likes to take long-term positions, is backing
the group's aim to double the number of WEW stores to about 125 over the
next five years in the process of expanding across the whole country from
its current strongholds in Scotland, the north of England and the Midlands.
Mr Peter Carr, who took over as executive chairman in August, is confident
that WEW's distinctive formula can turn it into the leading national
discount department store chain, but accepts that rebuilding credibility
with investors will be a long haul.
He says: 'The six new stores opened since August are trading 30 per cent
ahead of budget and I am convinced we have a great opportunity to go for.'
WEW's stores - which mainly sell clothing - are fairly large, averaging
15,000 sq ft, and are aimed at the less prosperous demographic groups C2DE,
which represent 63 per cent of the UK population. However, the group's
limited regional penetration means it is currently available to only 29 per
cent of that target customer base.
Mr Carr says: 'I would like to open 20 stores within the M25.'
Analysts continue to be impressed by the underlying WEW business, which has
an operating margin of 8.7 per cent. Mr Carr believes sales are too low at
Pounds 149 per square foot - and hopes to get up to Pounds 180.
One route would be by greater use of in-store concessions - a familiar
feature of the department store format which the new management team
favours. A licensee selling costume and gold jewellery did well before
Christmas and there are similar plans to introduce concessions selling
luggage and men's suits across the group.
Warburg Pincus is backing the new management team of Mr Carr and Mr Keith
Paskins, finance director. They are both experienced retailers, having
worked together with Galerias Preciados in Spain and before that with
Debenhams.
Mr Carr concedes things are very different in WEW from the disciplines he
was used to as part of a larger group. He says: 'There was no proper
business plan or budget. We are doing the first proper inventory this month.
We've got a lot of dud stock - we know that, but we don't know how much.'
The group has now installed a 'very basic' computerised stock control
system, which - though well short of the advanced electronic point of sales
techniques used by other retailers - should give much more financial
information.
Mr Paskins said: 'The financial systems we inherited didn't even show the
profitability of individual branches.'
This lack of investment in proper systems is one reason Mr Carr is confident
that WEW will prove a money-spinner. He says the discount market has moved
on from the days when the company could rely on selling 'cabbage' - a rag
trade term for other retailers' surplus stock, seconds and manufacturers'
over-runs.
By consistently stocking a broader and more comprehensive range Mr Carr
believes he will be able to predict the group's needs and source more
products directly from manufacturers - particularly low-cost producers
overseas.
Retail analysts accept that clearing out the stock position might impact on
performance in the current year to July, but are still hoping for pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 9m.
One said: 'It seems to be a good operation, with a very beleaguered past.
One problem is that we've never been able to look the same set of guys in
the eye and find out what happened. We need a long run of solid trading
results. But any more nasty surprises and confidence would go completely.'
