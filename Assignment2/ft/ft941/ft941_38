FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Maid worth over Pounds 100m in impending
market debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market Analysis and Information Database, an online business information
services supplier, is planning to raise a minimum of Pounds 25m through a
listing in the next few months.
The flotation, which is likely to be in the form of a placing and
intermediaries offer, is expected to value the company at more than Pounds
100m.
Maid Systems was founded in 1985 by Mr Daniel Wagner, aged 30, its chief
executive. It is an electronic publisher, offering subscribers a broad range
of business information through computer terminals on their desks.
It has contracts with a number of large information providers and competes
with services such as Profile, owned by the Financial Times, Mead Data
Central of the US and Reuters, the world's largest electronic publisher.
In the year to the end of December 1992, it made profits of Pounds 300,000
on turnover of Pounds 3.5m.
The company currently offers three core products: Researchline, with 20,000
research reports on 400 market sectors worldwide, Newsline, with business
reports from 4,000 newspapers, magazines and news agencies and Companyline,
which is expected to have financial and corporate information on 4.7m
companies.
Mr Wagner said yesterday that the company was planning a number of new
business information products.
The company said it has 3,500 end-users in 20 countries. Most are in the UK
but a client base has been established in the US.
It recently strengthened its management team with the appointment of Mr Tom
Teichman as director of corporate development. Mr Teichman was formerly head
of corporate finance at BMO Nesbitt Thomson, part of the Bank of Montreal
group. Mr Michael Mander, chairman of the Institute of Directors, is Maid's
non-executive chairman.
Hill Samuel Bank is sponsoring the flotation and Hoare Govett Corporate
Finance is the stockbroker.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Flotation expected to value MDIS at Pounds
250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Information Systems, a computing services company based in Hemel
Hempstead, is hoping to raise Pounds 150m through a long-anticipated full
public offering now set for early March.
The company will announce its plans today and publish its prospectus next
month. Its merchant bankers are Baring Brothers and its stockbrokers are
National Westminster Wood Mackenzie.
The flotation is expected to value the company at about Pounds 250m. The
funds will be used to pay down debt incurred when a group of investors led
by Baring Capital Investors bought the company last year from McDonnell
Douglas, the US aerospace group. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, and 16
of the company's senior managers were involved in the buy-out.
The value of the deal has not been disclosed but according to Acquisitions
Monthly, which tracks merger and acquisition activity, it was closed for a
consideration of about Pounds 120m and a total deal package of about Pounds
160m.
Mr Causley said yesterday that the rationale behind the flotation was the
creation of a debt-free group with the stamp of approval which accrues to a
successful public company. He was concerned that lack of a listing might be
hampering the group's progress, especially in bidding for large contracts.
MDIS's non-executive chairman is Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse
and Newspaper Publishing and Sir Terry Heiser, former permanent secretary at
the Department of the Environment is a non-executive director.
Last year's buy-out created one of the largest UK-owned information
technology groups with specific skills in software and services for central
and local government, the police, libraries and health care. It employs some
1,800 people, 1,300 of them in the UK.
For the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits were Pounds 5.2m on revenue
of Pounds 66.5m. MDIS traditionally performs better in the second half of
the year and for the full year operating profits are expected to be Pounds
22m, up 16 per cent on the previous year, on revenues of Pounds 148m.
Mr Causley said two key decisions had been crucial to the company's
development.
First, the decision in the early 1980s to concentrate on niche markets. MDIS
now supplies, for example, information systems to two thirds of the UK's
police forces and was the first to meet the specifications for the Home
Office Large Major Enquiry System (Holmes).
The system, called Micah, is now used in the UK in major incidents such as
murder and rape investigations and has been sold to police forces in
Australia, Hong Kong and the US.
The company has also supplied computer systems to 85 government
organisations and to 170 local authorities.
Second, the decision in 1988 to get out of hardware manufacture, leaving the
company free to develop open or industry standard systems using hardware
from a variety of suppliers.
The company also markets a software system called PRO-IV designed to make
the writing computer programs easier and faster. It has signed a worldwide
distribution agreement for the system with Fujitsu of Japan, the world's
second largest information technology group.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: GWR shares respond to sharp upturn in
advertising revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullish transmissions on advertising revenues at GWR, the independent radio
group which owns 17 per cent of Classic FM, carried the company's shares 17p
higher to 770p yesterday in spite of a declining market.
Mr Ralph Bernard, chief executive, said both local and national advertising
had improved significantly in the last six months. Like for like advertising
revenues in the first quarter were running more than 30 per cent ahead of
last year.
GWR recently bought four local stations for Pounds 15m, but revenues there
were just 5-6 per cent ahead. Mr Bernard said the difference with GWR's
existing stations represented 'immediate potential.'
The second half improvement in national advertising was partly responsible
for the group's announcement of a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 913,000 for the year to September 30. Sales were 14 per cent higher
at Pounds 9.8m.
The dividend is raised by 2p to 9p, via a final of 5p, with earnings up 16
per cent to 18.4p (15.9p).
Mr Bernard said GWR was now reaping the benefits of a decision two years ago
to focus on regional advertising, which had been more buoyant during
recession.
Classic FM, set up a year ago, now attracted some 4.5m listeners. GWR was
now looking to expand further in the UK and in eastern Europe.
GWR had acquired a 48 per cent interest in a Bulgarian radio station which
was already returning small profits. Mr Bernard said that in time this could
provide a base for expansion in other parts of eastern Europe.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fermec gains access to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fermec Holdings, the Manchester-based construction equipment company, is to
start selling its new range of backhoe loaders in North America through a
supply agreement with Kobelco America, the Japanese-owned distribution
company.
The deal is an important move for Fermec, which is best known by its MF
Industrial brand name and was formed in late 1992 in a management buy-out
from Varity Corporation's Massey Ferguson Group.
Fermec launched its new TLK range of backhoe loaders last March in a bid for
second place in a European market led by JC Bamford Excavators. The latest
deal fulfils a promise to develop coverage elsewhere through strategic
alliances, said Mr Richard Robson, managing director.
Kobelco America has about 100 dealers in the US and Canada which will start
selling Fermec backhoe loaders immediately under the TLK brand. Kobelco had
long been looking for a backhoe loader to complement its range of excavators
and other equipment.
Mr Keith Jones, Fermec's marketing and aftercare director, said Kobelco had
placed an order for 100 machines and was confident of selling 200 in the
first year of the agreement. Fermec expects to produce 2,500 backhoes this
year.
In the first nine months of trading, to September last year, Fermec had
annualised sales of Pounds 60m. It had already expected sales of Pounds 75m
in the current year, which ends in September, but the Kobelco America deal
is expected to add another Pounds 5m.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: USM float will put Pounds 4.2m tag on CFS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computerised Financial Solutions, which provides specialised computer
support and administrative services to financial institutions and
manufacturers, yesterday published its full prospectus ahead of a flotation
on the USM which will value the group at Pounds 4.23m.
A total of 1.59m shares, including 1.35m new shares, are being placed with
institutional investors at 90p each. The shares being placed represent 34
per cent of the group's enlarged share capital.
Mr Alfred Stein, a former Chrysler executive, founded Commercial Inventory
Service in 1976 and CIS was acquired earlier this month by CFS, a new
holding company.
Following the flotation IBM will hold just under 15 per cent of the enlarged
capital and Mr Stein, chief executive, will retain a 40.09 per cent stake.
Dealings are expected to begin on February 3.
The placing will raise Pounds 920,000 in new funds after expenses, which
will be used to repurchase existing preference shares and provide additional
working capital.
CFS expects pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 325,000 on turnover of
about Pounds 3.5m for 1993, producing earnings of not less than 6.42p.
The group has developed sophisticated software which is used by its
customers to improve their control of inventory finance and consumer
installment financing. The volume of transactions processed through its
computer system is worth more than Pounds 1.5bn a year.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: J Rothschild Assurance premium income rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise of almost 2 1/2 times from Pounds 101m to Pounds 250m in new premium
income at J Rothschild Assurance was largely due to an even sharper increase
in new single premium products.
Single premium income advanced from Pounds 82.7m to Pounds 221.4m, while
annual premium income rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 18.3m).
The company has been in business for only two years.
In both annual and single premium products, there were greater percentage
increases in pension than in life premium income. However, life single
premiums were the largest component with income of Pounds 165.2m.
Sums assured rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 900m), while funds
under management increased from Pounds 290m to Pounds 715m.
Sir Mark Weinberg, chairman, said that the size of the J Rothschild
partnership, which comprises the sales force, had grown from 400 to 500 last
year, and that much of the rise in new business came from greater
productivity.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Excalibur returns to black following
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to profits and an increase in the interim dividend boosted shares
of Excalibur, the precision engineering, giftware and jewellery group, by 6
1/2 p to 42p.
Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said he looked forward to 'a satisfactory
outcome for the full year'.
Mr Arthur Church, who joined as chief executive last summer, said the group
had been restructured into two divisions, precision engineering and consumer
products, with chief executives appointed to run each one.
Profits before tax for the six months to end-October were Pounds 1.03m
(losses of Pounds 183,000) and followed a deficit of Pounds 6.2m in the year
to April 1993 after provisions of Pounds 5.8m against the jewellery side.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 30.3m to Pounds 27.4m, as the jewellery
business was reduced in size and the engineering side was affected by
customers reducing stocks and moving to shorter lead times. Mr Griffiths
said that order books were now picking up.
Engineering turnover fell from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 11m with operating
profits down from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 937,000.
Sales of giftware rose from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 10.7m, with profits up
from Pounds 582,000 to Pounds 702,000. Mr Griffiths said that Pic-A-Tape,
which provides retailers with audio and video tapes and CDs, had won
Littlewoods and Little Chef as customers.
Jewellery sales were down from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 5.7m, with losses of
Pounds 1.11m turned to an almost break even position. These activities are
now described as 'non-core' with unprofitable business turned away and sales
concentrated on fewer important customers.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 837,000 to Pounds 608,000 while the tax
rate remained low at 12 per cent thanks to tax losses, which are expected to
keep the rate low for the full year.
Earnings per share were 1.5p (loss 0.6p) and the interim dividend is raised
by a quarter to 0.25p. The total dividend in 1992-93 was halved.
COMMENT
Institutional shareholders who lost patience with Excalibur and sold out at
prices either side of 10p must be kicking themselves now. The jewellery side
has at last been brought under control, and if rumour is to be believed,
could even disappear. That leaves a good engineering business, a designated
supplier to Rolls-Royce, for example, and an interesting giftware activity.
Profit forecasts for the year of about Pounds 2m suggest a p/e of about 14
with the tax rate staying low. That still leaves something to go for.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lep gets Pounds 89m from sale of property
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lep Group, the freight forwarding and security company restructured by its
banks in 1992, is to sell for Pounds 89m its long-term leasehold interest in
Swiss Bank House, the Swiss Bank Corporation's London headquarters, on the
River Thames south of St Paul's Cathedral.
The interest in the property was owned by St Paul's Vista, a Lep subsidiary,
and had a book value of Pounds 76m in Lep's balance sheet at the end of
1992.
Swiss Bank House is currently used to secure Pounds 75m of 7.3 per cent
secured notes of St Paul's Vista, due in 1995. Lep said the proceeds of the
sale would be used to provide alternative security for the notes, with the
net balance being available to reduce group borrowings.
Lep said in October it had debts of about Pounds 340m.
The disposal is in line with the group's stated objective of focusing on its
businesses of international freight forwarding and security services.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Israel Fund to raise Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's first specialist Israeli investment trust is to be launched next
month by Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities. It will be managed by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The Israel Fund, which will be listed on the Stock Exchange but dollar
denominated, aims to raise about Pounds 100m through a placing and offer for
subscription, closing on March 3. Listing particulars will be published on
February 17 and dealings are due to start on March 17.
Some UK emerging markets and technology funds currently invest small amounts
in Israeli companies, but this is the first specialist single-country fund
outside Israel and the US.
The Israeli-PLO peace process is starting to make investment in Israel more
attractive to foreign investors, but Mr Roger Hornett, an executive director
of Societe Generale Equities International, said that the peace process was
not the main motivating factor behind the fund's launch.
Russian immigrants, mostly highly qualified, have increased the Israeli
population by about 12 per cent over the last few years. Mr Hornett said
this immigration had first of all contributed to rising demand in the
economy, and was now adding to production. 'Immigration and growth have been
inextricably linked over a period of time, and the government is used to
dealing with it,' he said.
The fund will invest mainly in Israeli-listed companies, but will also have
holdings in unquoted and Nasdaq-listed groups and will have the option to
invest in non-Israeli companies deriving significant earnings from Israel.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shares fall 28p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Huntingdon International Holdings fell almost a fifth yesterday
after the life sciences, engineering and environmental company issued a
second profits warning in 12 months and blamed the parlous state of the
green industry.
The shares closed 28p lower at 119p.
Huntingdon said trading conditions in its US and UK-based engineering and
environmental services division were even weaker than the board had
indicated when annual results showing a near-40 per cent slide in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 8.79m were published in December.
It now planned to bring in specialist consultants to conduct a four-week
review of environmental and engineering operations.
'To expect environmental matters will provide a gratuitous upturn in our
fortunes is no way to run a business. We have recognised that - perhaps we
should have recognised it sooner,' said Mr Christopher Cliffe, finance
director.
'We have to decide whether the diversification programme into engineering
and environmental services still makes sense in view of the absence of
governments' willingness to enforce compliance and sign off any major
infrastructure projects in the UK,' he said.
Moreover, new legislation in the US has yet to materialise. The group had
hoped new laws would increase the workload of the 1,800 people it employs in
engineering and environmental services operations at 70 sites in the US.
The business, which now accounts for about 52 per cent of Huntingdon's total
revenue following last year's Pounds 3m rationalisation, was started up in
1985, growing mainly through a series of small acquisitions until 1991 when
it ran into the US recession.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Menzies pleases City with advance to Pounds
6.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Menzies, chairman of the retail and wholesale chain which carries
his name, said that the group's interim results continued to show the
improving trend of the last few years.
In the six months to October 30 pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 3.8m to
Pounds 6.3m, though Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director, said they
were skewed by Pounds 500,000 of losses last time from the now sold
Hammick's retail bookshop chain, and by halved interest charges of Pounds
800,000 this time.
The reduced interest costs reflected, he said, the strength of the group and
its cashflow as well as the management of working capital.
On the profits front, he said he was more encouraged by the 20 per cent
increase in operating profits on continuing operations to Pounds 7.1m
(Pounds 5.9m). The shares rose 30p to 654p on the day.
The main engine of growth was the distribution side which, as a high volume,
low margin business 'concentrates the mind', according to Mr Noel-Paton.
He echoed his chairman in his disappointment over the short shrift the
government gave the outcome of the MMC's 18-month inquiry into the
distribution of newspapers in England and Wales, but was confident the group
would not suffer from the government's intended liberalisation of newspaper
wholesaling.
TBD (home entertainment and book wholesaling) and Universal Office Supplies
both performed well in the period.
The retail side showed a similar pattern as previously, with Early Learning
Centres 'really performing well' with 'a sales rise in double digits'
balancing the John Menzies Retail chain, which is being restructured.
ELC has 177 outlets, two of which are superstores, which carry clothing and
nursery goods as well as toys and books. Mr Noel-Paton said this new format
had 'huge turnover'.
JM Retail consists of 276 stores, some 150 of which are to be redesigned
away from generalist outlets to multi-specialist shops.
Mr Noel-Paton also revealed a 6.5 per cent like-for-like increase in
retailing sales over the Christmas period with music sales at the forefront.
Group turnover climbed to Pounds 573.1m (Pounds 539.3m) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 4.1p (3.8p), payable from earnings per share more than
doubled to 5.9p (2.9p).

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sorting the debt from the equity - FRS 4
takes effect in June. Andrew Jack looks at the ramifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, did not
receive many Christmas cards from merchant bankers this year. His latest
salvo of regulations on the presentation of capital instruments have stoked
their ire.
From year-ends after June 22, British company accounts will have to comply
with the board's fourth Financial Reporting Standard (FRS 4), which
transforms the way in which instruments are classified between debt and
equity.
'There will be lots of people in the banks late at night with wet towels
around their heads trying to work out the loopholes in the proposals,' says
Mr Tweedie.
The so-called 'financial engineering' departments in banks and corporate
finance houses made a substantial living during the late 1980s in creating
devices designed to favourably bend accounting rules.
The aim was in part to create instruments that met the legal definition of
equity, hence keeping gearing low, diverting analysts' attention from high
levels of borrowing and reducing the risk of breaching banking covenants.
The result was an increasingly bizarre, tortuous and lengthy series of
capital instruments developed by different houses, such as convertible
capital bonds, deep discount bonds and repackaged perpetual debt.
Take the 1991 accounts of Ratners. The company requires a densely-written
three-page note to describe five classes of non-equity shares in issue such
as auction market preferred shares, with allotments shown at their nominal
values.
FRS 4 was issued by the board last month, almost unaltered from its draft
form as Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 3 (Fred 3) in December 1992. Its
effect will be to curtail the advantages of many of these instruments.
The standard introduces for the first time the concept of 'non-equity'
interests within shareholders' funds on the balance sheet, to distinguish
equity from instruments which have a restricted right to dividends or are
redeemable. The same distinction applies to minority interests.
It requires capital instruments to be classified as liabilities if they
contain an obligation to transfer cash or other resources. Convertible debt
should be included in liabilities until it is converted.
Liabilities themselves should be classified as current or non-current
according to their strict contractual maturity, except where the same lender
is committed to refinance the debt on the same terms.
Mr Peter Holgate, technical partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says: 'FRS 4 has
struck a very good balance in getting things in the right place. It is quite
a coherent set of principles.'
A number of companies have already fallen in line with the new requirements.
The 1992 Coats Viyella accounts show capital and reserves and shareholders'
funds on the balance sheet split between equity and non-equity, and include
redeemable convertible preference shares under long-term creditors.
Both Redland and Tesco now disclose their convertible capital bonds on the
face of the balance sheet as liabilities, while Attwoods also treats its
guaranteed convertible redeemable preference shares as liabilities.
Since last month's final version of the standard emerged, Mr Andrew Lennard,
the project director for FRS 4 and now assistant technical director of the
board, says: 'It's been remarkably quiet. It is quite clear that people are
moving in the right direction.'
However, that does not mean that there will not yet be ructions. A
substantial number of companies will need to implement significant change to
comply with the new requirements.
According to a recent sur-vey of 415 companies by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based monitor of accounts, one quarter showed evidence of capital
instruments.
BICC's 1992 accounts show an apparent balance sheet total of Pounds 724m,
but this includes a convertible capital bond of Pounds 177m. This will have
to be treated as a liability and deducted under FRS 4. So will Pounds 18m in
minority interests guaranteed by the parent company.
Thorn EMI's balance sheet total is Pounds 719m. But this includes in
minority interests Pounds 132m of auction preferred stock and Pounds 103m of
shares guaranteed by the parent, both of which will have to be reclassified
as non-equity under FRS 4.
Other companies still continuing to include convertible capital bonds in
their balance sheet totals are British Airways and Reckitt &amp; Coleman.
Mr Holgate says: 'It is surprising how many quirks are developing in
practice.' He highlights instances such as the new requirement to restate
and spread the issue costs of instruments over their terms which are
concerning companies.
But he argues that the greatest change will come in companies being required
under FRS 4 to reclassify commercial paper in most circumstances as
short-term debt. That was a reform that a number opposed in the draft
standard, but on which the board remained firm.
The question is how far the financial engineering industry will kotow to the
new capital instrument requirements, particularly as the costs of raising
money begin to increase again with recovery.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tring settles copyright dispute with EMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the budget price compact disc company, has agreed to
pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music, which had sued it for breach of copyright.
The British Phonographic Industry, which represents UK music companies, said
the payment settled cases of alleged breach of copyright of recordings by
Olivia Newton John and of Puccini's La Boheme.
The company still faces legal action for breach of copyright from other
music groups, including PolyGram and MCA.
Ms Sara John, BPI's director of legal affairs, said Tring had agreed to pay
Pounds 10,000 for each of the alleged copyright violations and EMI had
accepted that.
She added: 'The message is clear: all companies involved in the issuing of
back catalogue recordings must be extremely careful about their licensing
arrangements. If there is not a system in place for monitoring licences,
there should be. The BPI and its members will continue to pursue vigorously
any further breaches of copyright such as this.'
Tring said: 'The financial impact of the litigation is not material to the
group. However, we are extremely pleased to have resolved all matters with
EMI.'
Tring postponed its stock market flotation last year, citing the weakness of
the new issue market, but said it planned to go ahead with a listing in the
first quarter of 1994. The company expects to make pre-tax profits of more
than Pounds 5m in the year to March 31 1994.
Mr Alan Wheatley, a former chairman of venture capital group 3i who had
agreed to be chairman of the company, has withdrawn. The company now intends
to appoint Mr Tony Morris, a former vice president of PolyGram
International.

FT  25 JAN 94 / American Express to spin off Lehman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Express is to pump Dollars 1.25bn into its Lehman Brothers
investment banking subsidiary to enable it to become a free-standing firm,
marking the credit card group's final withdrawal from the securities and
investment banking arenas.
The recapitalisation signals a decision by American Express not to float
Lehman, as had been expected. Instead, it is to issue shares in the company
to existing American Express shareholders, and will receive a share of
future Lehman profits of up to Dollars 550m.
The spin-off of Lehman, shares in which will be traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, will create an investment bank which had post-tax income last year
of Dollars 376m and which would be valued at around Dollars 3.5bn, if the
stock market values it in a similar way to its rivals.
Explaining the reason not to float Lehman, Mr Harvey Golub, chairman and
chief executive of American Express, said the deal announced yesterday would
give the greatest value to the group's shareholders. A flotation of Lehman,
raising additional capital, would have attracted a tax charge on the
spin-off, he said. Also, American Express has the cash resources to
recapitalise the company without needing to tap the public markets, Mr Golub
said.
Under the terms of the deal, American Express is to put in Dollars 890m to
buy common stock in Lehman, as well as preference share capital of Dollars
200m. All the shares in the group will be distributed to American Express
shareholders, leaving the credit card group with only an interest in
Lehman's profits, if they exceed a set level in future years.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Norton gets set for another comeback via US listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norton, a nostalgic name in British motorcycling, is set to make a comeback
as a listed company via a reverse takeover in the US.
A group of Canadian investors, who last year bought Norton's motorcycling
interests from the receivers, said yesterday they were reversing into a
company quoted on the US bulletin board, in so-called pink sheet securities.
Under the transaction, shareholders in Wildrose - the Canadian company which
paid around CDollars 1m (Pounds 500,000) last October for Norton's name and
assets - will receive new shares in the enlarged company.
Mr Nelson Skalbania, speaking for Wildrose for which he has described
himself as a consultant, said the name of the bulletin board company - to be
relisted as Norton Motors or Norton BSA - would probably be disclosed this
week. The aim is to revive the motorcycling business, which has struggled to
make a profit for more than 20 years.
Earlier moves to refinance the company came unstuck last year when Wildrose
was suspended from the Alberta exchange after failing to disclose documents
on the Norton takeover. Mr Ian Brown, executive vice-president of the
Alberta stock exchange, said: 'We have not yet recognised the Norton Motors
transaction. Mr Skalbania has been involved in a number of train wrecks with
public companies.'
Uncertainty over the Canadian investor's moves have been heightened by
revelations that in May he will face fraud, theft and forgery charges in
Canada relating to a collapsed property deal.
Industry analysts in London also voiced concern at Norton's ability to
finance motorcycle production at its Shenstone plant in the Midlands. 'With
their track record nobody would do anything without cash up-front,' one
analyst said.
The Serious Fraud Office, meanwhile, is investigating alleged mismanagement
at Norton when it was run by Mr Philippe Le Roux, who resigned in 1991 after
the Department of Trade and Industry ordered an inquiry.
Mr David MacDonald, Mr Le Roux's successor, said the sale to Wildrose 'was
not in the interests of shareholders, creditors or employees'. Mr MacDonald
resigned in September, before Norton Group was wound up.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Roche finds new meaning post-Valium: The world's most highly
valued drugs group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roche is back. The big Swiss drugs group has staged a remarkable recovery to
the head of its field following a long and severe case of post-Valium
depression.
The publication last week of the FT-500 ranking of Europe's top companies
revealed that Roche had risen to become the third largest with a market
value of Dollars 35.7bn (Pounds 24bn), exceeded only by British Telecom and
Royal Dutch/Shell.
This followed another milestone last September when the group surpassed
Merck of the US to become the world's most highly valued drugs group, a rank
it had not held since the peak of the tranquiliser boom in the late 1960s.
Roche - still remembered by some for its prosecution of a British former
employee who exposed its vitamin price fixing practices in 1973 - has
achieved this comeback at a time when the profits and prospects of most big
pharmaceuticals groups are suffering from government moves to rein in
healthcare spending.
Roche sales jumped 11 per cent to SFr14.3bn (Pounds 6.5bn) last year, the
third successive year of double digit growth, and net income is estimated at
SFr2.54bn, a third above the 1992 level.
Investors believe that the group has several more years of double digit
profit growth in store, and have bid up the shares to 18 times estimated
1994 earnings, well ahead of other leading drugs groups.
The main reason for this optimism is Roche's chock-full pipeline of new
products.
The group's extraordinarily strong balance sheet, with cash and securities
believed to total about SFr2bn, is also much valued at a time when the
pressures on competitors might yield a once-in-a-lifetime acquisition
opportunity.
All this is a long way from 1978 when Mr Paul Sacher, the orchestra
conductor and musical philanthropist who leads the controlling Hoffmann-La
Roche family interests in the group, called on Mr Fritz Gerber, a prominent
Swiss industrialist, to become executive chairman.
Mr Sacher sensed that the phenomenal success of Valium and Librium had
undermined the group's dynamism, and the impending expiry of patents on
these tranquilisers threatened its future. Mr Gerber entered to find the
group with few profitable products other than tranquilisers, and a research
department that lived well but had nothing coming along.
As it takes 10 years to bring a new drug to market, he did a deal with Glaxo
whereby the British group would use Roche's large sales force in the US to
sell its then new anti-ulcer drug, Zantac.
He also brought out an injectible antibiotic that had been developed
in-house, but rejected by Roche's R&amp;D managers as uninteresting. Rocephin
hit the market just at the right time. Its use in hospitals has become
widespread because its once-a-day application saves staff time and money. It
is still Roche's top selling product.
These two moves alone probably saved the group from traumatic surgery. Since
then, it has patiently rebuilt a dynamic R&amp;D system, and now has a wide
variety of products both on the market and in the pipeline. Never again will
it depend on a blockbuster like Valium, Roche officials promise.
Roche's product line impresses investors because it is aimed mainly at
hospitals rather than retail chemists. The hospital market has long been a
tough professional sell, so the group is suffering less than competitors
from the squeeze on retail drug prices.
Gerber admits that the potential for price rises, even to keep pace with
inflation, will be severely limited for the foreseeable future, so the group
has to rely even more on innovative products.
Increasingly, it is aiming its efforts at intractable diseases where the
rewards, although difficult to achieve, could be the greatest. It has
leading products for easing chemotherapy effects, for leukaemia, depression,
Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, rheumatism, heart failure and Aids.
Gerber has sharpened Roche's other divisions, selling off some unpromising
businesses, such as agricultural chemicals, and strengthening others with
acquisitions.
The over-the-counter medicines division was propelled to internationally
competitive size with the Dollars 821m purchase of Nicholas, maker of Aspro
and Rennie, in 1991.
The flavours and fragrances division became the number two in its sector
with the acquisition of Fritzsche, Dodge and Olcott in 1990 and the merger
of Givaudan and Roure the following year.
Investors are especially excited by two biotechnology ventures.
Three years ago, Roche bought a 60 per cent stake in Genentech of California
for Dollars 2bn. Genentech produces a widely used genetically engineered
drug, Activase, for combating blood clotting in heart attack victims, and
has just won approval for Pulmozyme, which treats cystic fibrosis and has
prospects for easing bronchitis. Genentech puts Roche at the forefront of
genetic engineering which is beginning to challenge chemistry as a source of
drug innovation.
In 1991, Roche paid Dollars 300m to a US company for a diagnostic
technology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which analyses blood for
various diseases. It has since spent several hundreds of millions of dollars
getting PCR into marketable form.
With PCR kits, technicians can test for HIV, the virus that is thought to
cause Aids, in a matter of hours rather than the several weeks required by
former methods, and with greater accuracy. The group has just launched an
automated PCR system for medium-sized laboratories that will test for up to
eight diseases, and is already pressed to fill orders.
In spite of these aggressive investments, Roche has amassed an immense cash
pile. Gerber says the strong balance sheet enables the group to take big
risks, such as the Genentech and PCR purchases.
'I would never have had the courage to do those if I had had to borrow,' he
says.
The group's financial dealings have also provided a healthy profits stream.
Mr Henri Meier, finance director, refuses to reveal tactical details, but
insists that the group invests only in top-rated securities. He rejects
allegations that it invests in its own shares, manipulating the market in
them.
The once secretive and arrogant Roche has become much more investor and
consumer friendly, but there is still some mystery and concern about its
future control, especially as Mr Sacher is 88. All voting shares are in
bearer form and so the only thing that is clear is that the family owns a
majority.
Gerber simply says that there is an iron clad pooling arrangement among
family members to maintain an outright majority of the voting shares 'well
into the next century'.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Boeing down 15% as orders sag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lower orders from the world's beleaguered airline industry caused Boeing,
the US aircraft maker, to report a 15 per cent fall in net fourth quarter
profits to Dollars 304m (Pounds 205m) yesterday.
The company said the number of commercial aircraft delivered during the
quarter slumped from 102 the previous year to 61, and warned that it
expected no reversal of the downward trend until deliveries of its new 777
aircraft began in the middle of next year.
On Friday Boeing confirmed it was shedding 3,000 fewer jobs than the 28,000
it had expected to cut a year ago, partly because of the early phases of
work on a new derivative of the 737 family known as the 737-700.
Yesterday, however, the company emphasised that recovery remained a long way
off. Commercial jet deliveries were expected to fall to between 250 and 260
this year, from 330, and sales were forecast to shrink by about 20 per cent
to Dollars 20bn-Dollars 21bn.
Fourth quarter turnover dropped from Dollars 7.5bn to Dollars 5.7bn, and
earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.05 to 89 cents. For the year as a
whole, turnover slid from Dollars 30.2bn to Dollars 25.4bn, while net
profits fell from Dollars 1.56bn to Dollars 1.24bn and earnings per share
dropped from Dollars 4.57 to Dollars 3.66.
Analysts are forecasting another sharp decline in profits for the current
year.
Boeing said airline operating performance remained mixed, reflecting varying
economic conditions around the world. Overall, increases in passenger
traffic and revenues had contributed to better net revenue yields last year,
it said, but not all markets had improved.
'The company remains optimistic about the longer term global market and
Boeing's ability to maintain a favourable market share,' it said.
Assembly of the 777 twin-jet was continuing on schedule, Boeing said, with
roll-out of the first aircraft due in April and flight-testing beginning in
the summer. Announced orders for the aircraft from 16 customers world-wide
totalled 147.
Boeing said defence and space orders were 20 per cent lower than last year,
but it had improved operating margins in these businesses with the help of
'excellent' cost management.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Lonrho hotels stake loses Pounds 180m in value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho will today disclose that the value of its two thirds holding in
Metropole Hotels has fallen by around Pounds 180m - almost exactly what
Libya paid for its 33 per cent stake in the hotels group less than two years
ago.
The fall of around Pounds 250m in the overall value of Metropole is likely
to add a twist to the complicated relationship between the international
trading group and the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, which bought
its stake for Pounds 177.5m in March 1992.
Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's founder and joint chief executive, believes the
relationship with Libya will generate profitable opportunities for the
company and should be strengthened. But his fellow joint chief executive, Mr
Dieter Bock, is embarrassed by the Libyan connection and feels it hinders
his attempts to encourage investment institutions to buy Lonrho shares.
Lonrho will also confirm today that four close supporters of Mr Rowland have
agreed to resign from the board in return for payments equivalent to two
years' salary.
Their departure, which requires shareholder approval because the payments
exceed contractual requirements, ends Mr Rowland's 30-year domination of the
company.
In results announced this morning, Lonrho will disclose a fall in the value
of its net assets of between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m, largely
attributable to a revaluation of the Metropole, which owns hotels in
Brighton, Blackpool, Birmingham and London.
Lonrho's profits for the year to September 30 are also thought to have been
less than most investment analysts' estimates. Pre-tax profits including
disposal gains are likely to be disclosed as more than Pounds 120m, compared
with Pounds 114m, but considerably less than the Pounds 150m expected by
some. Profits from ongoing businesses are thought to be less than Pounds
80m, below analysts' estimates but well above the previous year's Pounds
39m.
The damage to the balance sheet from the Metropole devaluation is expected
to be short-lived, since its 45 per cent shareholding in Ashanti Goldfields
is believed to have a balance sheet value of less than Pounds 100m. This
could be revalued to more than Pounds 400m once Ashanti is floated later
this year.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Bee-keepers seek Brussels sweetener as imports sting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
No cliche was spared as 2,000 European bee-keepers protested outside a
meeting of EU agriculture ministers yesterday.
The angry swarm demanded subsidies to help combat cheap imports of honey
from Mexico and China.
'Don't let bee-keeping die out]' the apiculturists' banners appealed on
behalf of a proclaimed 480,000 bee-keepers across Europe, as officials and
journalists reeled off the puns.
"They're saying it's a 'to bee or not to bee' situation,' smirked one
official. Another opined: 'We'll have to keep them sweet.'
Amid the merriment, the demonstrators, more gentle in demeanour than the
normal run of irate farmer descending on Brussels, handed out free honey,
emphasising the environmental contribution bees make through pollenating
plants.
The European Commission, at any rate, was unstung by the criticism,
insisting that there were only 14,000 real EU bee-keepers (with 150 hives or
more each); that they get national subsidies per hive in the main producing
countries of Spain, Germany and France; and that those producers were the
ones blocking Brussels' plans for safeguard clauses against cheap imports.
Mr John Home, a British bee-keepers' leader who, dressed as a bee, was
received by Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, complained that
EU apiculturists had to pay three times as much as their competitors for the
sugar they feed bees in winter.
Ah yes, one quick-witted EU diplomat said, but that is because we are
foolish enough to subsidise sugar, creating a surplus at inflated prices.
Perhaps a genius of the stature of Einstein would have suggested offloading
some of the surplus sugar on to the bee-keepers, sweetening a sticky
situation.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Tory backbenchers furious at plans to abolish councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local Conservative MPs responded with fury yesterday to proposals by Sir
John Banham's Local Government Commission to abolish Humberside and North
Yorkshire county councils and split them into seven all-purpose unitary
authorities.
Hull and York would be given self-governing status and Lincolnshire would
retain its present two-tier structure with a county council and seven
districts. North Yorkshire and Humberside would be split into three large
rural authorities called 'ridings'.
Mr Robert Banks, MP for Harrogate, said: 'I think the decision is a complete
load of rubbish. This is a totally unworkable proposal, and I don't see any
liking for it among the people in the areas concerned.'
Several influential Conservatives attacked the plans as political opposition
intensified to the commission, which is due to redraw the administrative map
of non-metropolitan England by the end of this year.
But Sir John was confident that his proposals would be implemented: 'We have
learnt to have great confidence in the ability of local people to see
through the posturing of local interests and the knee-jerk reactions of
sound-bite politicians.'
Sir John's proposal for Lincolnshire conflicts with Mr Gummer's latest
guidance to the commission that the status quo should be retained only in
'exceptional' circumstances. The department has already told the commission
to reconsider proposals to retain two tiers in Derbyshire and County Durham.
But Sir John said there was 'no demand for change' from either local people
or the special interests involved in Lincolnshire. He said: 'I would be
surprised if ministers would be so foolish as to force down the throats of
the people changes to the structure of local government, disruptive as it
is, unless there was very persuasive evidence that change was what local
people wanted to see.'
Environment Department officials privately admitted that MPs in the
Lincolnshire area had formally expressed their concern at the end of last
year that there should be no change to the structure in their county.
Political reaction concentrated on Yorkshire. Mr William Hague, a social
security minister and MP for Richmond, predicted that the new 'North Riding'
would cover too wide an area. Local district councils also said the three
new ridings would be too big.

The battle for control of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday is
currently being fought between paper tigers. We have been treated to the
rather rum sight of a group of directors avoiding the rest of the board
while they prepared a bid. Now a consortium of the founder-directors, El
Pais, La Repubblica and the Mirror Group have announced an intention to bid,
yet no firm offer is on the table.
The consortium also looks slightly odd given that the continental Europeans
will have voting control, while Mirror Group will be a substantial minority
shareholder with long term production contracts. The extra cash to be
subscribed for promotion also seems likely to be debt, presumably to avoid
diluting the founders. That can only be sustained provided cost savings can
return the newspapers to cash neutrality. If there is a continuing need for
the consortium to inject money, the debt could quickly become equity. Since
the Mirror can offer substantial logistical support, there are reasons to
believe that its consortium can produce the papers at a lower break-even
point than many potential suitors. That may also imply that they can offer a
better price. But the rumours of a bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly continue to
swirl thickly. Whatever the niceties, the board of Newspaper Publishing will
have little to go on but price. Bids have been lost before with the support
of 47 per cent of the shareholders. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith has not won
yet.

FT  25 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals bulls hoping for a quick solution to the problem of overcapacity
in aluminium may be disappointed. The draft memorandum which emerged from
last week's negotiations among producing countries stops short of allocating
capacity reductions among continents, let alone companies. That may reflect
worries about anti-trust legislation in the US and the reluctance of Russian
officials to be tied down without a firm commitment on the western side. But
vague wording will make meaningful cuts difficult to enforce - always
assuming that governments accept the draft by Friday's deadline.
The danger must be that the metal's price rises in anticipation of cuts, but
the memorandum allows producers enough latitude to back off. While the fall
in aluminium yesterday suggests a healthy scepticism among commodities
traders, equity markets appear to be taking a stronger aluminium price for
granted. Pechiney's shares have risen by 40 per cent since the autumn,
Alusuisse by only slightly less. In North America, Kaiser and Alcan have
matched that performance.
While all producers would gain from a stronger aluminium price, the benefit
would not be spread evenly. As a net buyer of aluminium, Alusuisse could
find its margins squeezed unless the price of fabricated products also
rises. With Europe in deep recession, that cannot be taken for granted.
Exporters of alumina and bauxite into Russia - Alcoa chief among them -
stand to lose a valuable market if Siberian smelters are closed.

Talks between British Aerospace and Honda over the ownership of Rover might
seem a little odd at this stage of the business cycle. After all, Rover has
had to invest in new models - most recently the Rover 600 - and work hard to
cut working capital in order to get through the recession. Since Rover is
now gaining market share, should BAe not sit back and reap the benefits of
the hard work?
If BAe were free of any other constraints that might be true. But the
capital intensive nature of the motor industry means that companies are
rarely far away from the demands of new model development. While Rover
should begin to swing into profit, substantial cash generation to fund other
BAe projects may remain merely a nice idea. Meanwhile, Rover's working
capital requirements remain significant. This far, Honda has had the comfort
of a 20 per cent equity holding without having to cover any of Rover's
financing costs. An agreement on closer co-operation which involved Honda
sharing that burden would free up some of BAe's capital for use in other
parts of the business. If that were accompanied by a sale of Rover equity to
Honda at above book value it would also help underpin BAe's balance sheet.
That may be particularly useful at a time when BAe may wish to make
provisions against leases on its turboprop aircraft leases.
Honda too has reasons to pursue discussions. Gradually closer links between
manufacturers is part of the Japanese way of business. And cementing the two
companies more tightly would help Honda shut out a potential European
competitor.

FT  25 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: The capacity to recover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing industry could hardly be doing better, according to the CBI.
Demand is growing, albeit slowly. Export prospects have taken only a limited
knock from sterling's rise against the D-Mark. The strength of the US
economy helps, especially since sterling is weaker against the dollar than
when the last survey was taken. But export optimism also reflects the
steepest fall in unit costs since 1958 which is helping to boost margins
despite weak price rises.
Less clear is the extent to which cost cutting has resulted in capacity
being scrapped. A striking feature of the survey is the speed with which
capacity use has risen. Only 57 per cent of respondents are now operating
below capacity compared with 73 per cent a year ago. One reason could be
that the official figures understate the true level of output and demand,
but that sits badly with weak prices. Another may be that a slimmed-down
capacity is being used more efficiently. Operational gearing would then be
mainly responsible for the downward pressure on costs.
Capacity use cannot continue to grow at this rate without running up against
constraints. Though not an immediate problem, it would be comforting to see
stronger evidence of investment growth. The survey suggests most new
investment is still designed to improve efficiency rather than add capacity.
Worry about inadequate return is a deterrent. That could be because real
rates of interest are still too high. But many managers may still not have
adjusted expectations of nominal return to the new low inflation
environment.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Yeltsin criticises Chernomyrdin for 'mistakes' over
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday reproached Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, his prime minister, for 'mistakes' in forming his government
and rejected the resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov as finance minister.
Mr Fyodorov, who had been asked at the weekend to stay on by an apparently
chastened Mr Chernomyrdin, was holding out for the dismissal of Mr Victor
Gerashchenko as central bank chairman before he would agree to remain in the
cabinet.
While Mr Yeltsin wants to keep his reputation as a reformist intact, Mr
Chernomyrdin, stung by the international outcry over his plans to 'correct'
reforms and let Mr Fyodorov go, has dismissed the backlash as being whipped
up against him.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, his new economics minister, went further, saying a
press campaign aimed to topple Mr Chernomyrdin by the spring.
Meanwhile, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the most vocal foreign adviser to the
Russian government until his resignation last week, blamed the International
Monetary Fund for not disbursing enough funds to support reformers. He said
the Fund's chief, Mr Michel Camdessus, should quit.
In Washington, Mr Strobe Talbott, special adviser on the former Soviet Union
to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned the new Russian
government that foreign aid would remain closely linked to economic reform.
'Gradual reform is a prescription for hyperinflation and economic collapse,'
Mr Talbott added, while warning that the US must not expect results
overnight.
Although the Russian president did not see Mr Fyodorov as expected
yesterday, Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, said the two
men might meet today.
Mr Fyodorov instead met Mr Vladimir Shcherbakov, the man who is being
considered by Mr Chernomyrdin as his replacement at the finance ministry.
Mr Shcherbakov, who now runs a Russian investment fund, belonged to the last
Soviet government which tried to depose President Mikhail Gorbachev. 'He
will accept any spending decisions. He will be a decoration,' said Mr
Alexashenko.
Mr Yeltsin's spokesman gave no details of the 'mistakes' for which the
president had berated his premier. But one possible compromise is that Mr
Fyodorov might be offered a vacant post as a first deputy prime minister.
But the position of number two or three in the government would still leave
unsatisfied Mr Fyodorov's demand for what he calls 'the scalp' of Mr
Gerashchenko, whom he has accused of 'provocations' at the central bank to
undermine his attempts to stabilise Russia's finances.
In response to a plea from Mr Anatoly Chubais, the other senior reformer in
the Russian government, for the sacking of the central bank governor, Mr
Yeltsin is said to have replied yesterday that the time was not right. 'Let
him make another mistake,' Mr Yeltsin was quoted as saying.

Maxwell Communication Corporation? Plans are afoot to invite all the members
of the Maxwell creditors' committee for a good night out to see  - Maxwell:
the Musical Revue.
Mark Homan, PW's head of insolvency, insists that were such an event to take
place, it would be paid for from the firm's marketing budget, and not from
the professional fees charged on the insolvency. Of course, though, given
the total bill from accountants, lawyers and bankers is likely to run to
more than Pounds 60m, they could probably buy the theatre.

Has John Major's counter-attack commenced? Michael Portillo could be
forgiven for thinking so. Despite Downing Street's insistence that the chief
secretary's recent speech condemning national cynicism had John Major's full
support, someone in No 10 seems to think Portillo should adopt a lower
profile.
Portillo planned to deliver another hard-hitting address  - this time on
Britain's place in Europe  - last weekend. But officials at No 10 scored red
lines through several key passages of the draft version. Portillo concluded
that there was nothing left worthy of releasing, so the speech went
unreported.
That's two defeats in a week; two days earlier Portillo's opposition to
London's cross-rail transport project was publicly over-ruled by Major. The
big guns are stirring . . .

The debate over whether Lord Healey ever threatened to 'squeeze the rich
until the pips squeak' rumbles on. Healey has denied it on page 369 of his
memoirs but the phrase still niggles some old hands who were around the last
time that a Labour party was on the brink of power, 20 years ago.
Could it be that Lord Healey made the remark  - not an original one as it
was used against the Germans after the Treaty of Versailles  - off the
record? Then he would never have said it . . . officially.

Bad news for the seedy CD-Rom industry. A Japanese court has ruled that a
ban on a strip-tease computer game is constitutional. Gainax, manufacturers
of Electronic Brain Academy Scenario 1  - the game in question  - failed to
persuade the Miyazaki district court that the ban violated its freedom of
expression.
The judge ruled that the game, which involved a schoolgirl removing an item
of clothing each time a question was answered correctly, 'could give rise to
considerable stimulation of sexual feelings in youth', and would 'develop in
young men the wrong view that girls are tools that exist to satisfy their
sexual demands'. Back to the drawing board presumably.

Funny how the big jobs in Swedish business are suddenly being handed out to
grey unknowns. Volvo's Pehr Gyllenhammar has been replaced by ABB's
Bert-Olof Svanholm and now Ericsson's Jan Stenberg has stepped into Jan
Carlzon's old slot at Scandinavian Airlines Systems. A couple of less
flamboyant figures would be hard to imagine.
Stenberg, a low-key business executive, has spent his entire career at the
telecommunications group and Svanholm has also been plucked from the heart
of Swedish industry. But different times require different types. Carlzon
was a super salesman who never got a proper grip on SAS's costs while
Gyllenhammer's grand visions rarely seemed to pay
off.
The challenge now is to ensure that the two companies can survive long-term
after the collapse of their ambitious merger plans. All the signs are that
SAS will concentrate on its core airline and Volvo on cars and trucks.
The new faces at the top of SAS and Volvo may be rather grey but the
appointments are a belated recognition that both SAS and Volvo are finally
going to have to swallow some of the unappetising medicine already downed by
their counterparts elsewhere in Swedish industry.

Poor old Gunter Baer. The secretary-general of the European central bank
governors' committee was thought to have sewn up the director-general's job
at the European Monetary Institute. His committee had carried out most of
the functions now transferred to the EMI and everyone seemed to think that
he had acquitted himself perfectly well in the old job.
But Baer has now fallen prey to a familiar problem for international job
hunters. In return for Frankfurt getting the EMI, France gets to tighten its
iron grip on the international financial jobs which matter. Robert Raymond,
a senior Bank of France official, will be nodded through as the EMI's
director-general at next month's council meeting in Basle.
In his early 60s, Raymond is a distinguished former head of research at the
French central bank and currently in charge of its credit department. Hence
no one doubts his ability  - and his advanced years could save the European
taxpayer big redundancy payments in an institution that is due to be
abolished if and when Europe adopts economic and monetary union.
However, the job is supposed to be a hands-on affair that could involve,
among other things, a good deal of negotiation with local worthies. Pity
Raymond can't speak the lingo.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Test of time for a talking shop: As the annual economic
forum at Davos gets under way, Ian Rodger asks whether the reality lives up
to the billing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police units from all over eastern Switzerland rolled into the Prattigau
valley in the northern Grisons last weekend. They are now tramping over
virtually every Alp within 20 miles of Davos, securing the entire area as if
in preparation for war.
No battles are expected, but these policemen are preparing for an invasion.
Starting on Thursday, a broad cross-section of the world's political,
business, academic, media and arts leaders will descend again on the ugly
concrete town for five days of public lectures and panel sessions, private
seminars, private deal making and plain old schmoozing.
The tradition of the Davos jamboree  - the annual meeting of the World
Economic Forum  - started in January 1971 as a modest, one-off gathering of
444 businessmen and academics organised by the then young Swiss business
school professor, Klaus Schwab.
In recent years, it has mushroomed into something much grander. Presidents
and prime ministers, business tycoons and media barons all flock there. This
weekend, more than 100 private jets will be parked at Zurich airport and
others will have to be diverted to St Moritz. What do all these people come
for?
Important things can happen at Davos. It was there in January 1990 that
German chancellor Helmut Kohl met east German leader Hans Modrow, opening
the door for German reunification. In January 1992 Nelson Mandela appeared
there on the same public platform with F. W. de Klerk and Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi of the Inkatha Zulu organisation, and renounced the African
National Congress's nationalisation policy.
The WEF also claims credit for initiating the process that led to the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations which ended in December,
having set up an informal meeting in 1982 of leading country trade
ministers.
This weekend, the Middle East will take centre stage, with PLO leader Yassir
Arafat and Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres topping an impressive list
of visitors from that region. There will be a pride of prime ministers:
Narasimha Rao from India, Benazir Bhutto from Pakistan and Viktor
Chernomyrdin from Russia. Also attending will be Chancellor Kohl and UK
chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke.
But despite such a glittering cast, the quality of the public seminars and
panel sessions is usually mediocre, with professors and politicians merely
repeating the positions set out in their latest books or legislative
campaigns.
Business leaders come mainly to see each other privately in a relaxed
atmosphere free from lawyers, spin doctors and other hangers-on. One
prominent international banker says: 'It's a great place to meet our clients
but we don't pay any attention to the spectacle.' Who knows how many
commercial disputes have been settled or how many prices have been fixed
over the years behind the closed doors of Davos's snow-covered chalets?
The great appeal of the gathering to the world's top people is the security.
Thanks to the geography and the meticulous Swiss police, this is a place
where even the most nervous politician or plutocrat can take off his
bullet-proof vest and mingle freely.
Participants also appreciate the emphasis put on networking. WEF organisers
work hard to ensure that those who come are able to see whoever they need or
want to see, and that everyone who has something to say has an opportunity
to say it.
Aside from a few formal plenary sessions, the event consists mainly of
dozens of small seminars, many behind closed doors, where informality and
argument are vigorously promoted.
WEF officials recoil from hearing Davos called a mere conference. 'Davos is
not a conference; everyone there is an actor,' snaps Maria Livanos Cattaui,
the organisation's formidable managing director.
Schwab, the WEF's president and driving force, says he got the idea in the
late 1960s from reading Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber's bestseller, The
American Challenge. The book posited that US business skills were so far
ahead of those elsewhere that Europe would soon be dominated by American
multinational companies.
The shy but ambitious Schwab had just completed studies at the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard, and knew an opportunity when he saw it. 'I
thought, why not get European entrepreneurs together and introduce them to
the best American management methods?'
At the first conference, economist John Kenneth Galbraith and futurist
Herman Kahn, members of Schwab's network from his Harvard days, were the
drawing cards. The next two conferences flopped. Schwab muses that, having
heard and accepted the new management religion at the first one, people saw
no need to come again.
Then came the first oil crisis of 1973. 'We thought we would change Davos
into a place where the business community could meet its constituents,
particularly from the political side, but also trade unionists and
environmentalists,' Schwab recalls.
Casting the net a little wider did the trick and the WEF has never looked
back. Its membership, consisting of companies willing to pay Dollars 13,000
a year (Dollars 16,000 for financial institutions), has grown steadily  -
even during the current recession  - and now stands at more than 900. On top
of the annual fee, members pay Dollars 6,500 to send one person, usually
their chief executive, to Davos for the conference.
The annual meeting regularly packs in close to 2,000 people, comprising most
member companies, 600 invited academics, politicians and senior civil
servants, and 300 media representatives. Schwab has dreamed up several other
events and services to keep his 80 staff busy for the rest of the year. The
WEF arranges several mini-Davos-type gatherings, some about a specific
country, others on regional issues, and most of them successful. Ventures
into magazine publishing and an electronic mail system for members have been
less so.
All of this activity is organised from a crowded converted villa overlooking
Geneva. Schwab, something of an intellectual snob, cultivates a campus
atmosphere, with himself in the role of chancellor, coming up with ideas and
acting as a self-appointed ambassador at large to the world's most
influential people.
He is backed by a six-strong executive board, all selected in large part for
their academic qualifications. Mrs Cattaui, a 20-year veteran, is the
undisputed field general, shrieking orders and shouting down dissent from a
large office at the epicentre of the building. Two other middle-aged women,
Macha Levinson and Colette Mathur, help keep things on an even keel.
Immediately below them, three intense young men complete the executive
board. Turnover at this level and below is high, because most of the work is
drudgery and there is little prospect of advancement.
Still, the academic environment of the WEF headquarters is one that appeals
to the young multilingual postgraduates who seem to hover around Geneva.
They hope that in return for putting in long hours on WEF projects they can
achieve something that might have an impact on the big picture. And there is
fair chance that they will. The WEF team is always scanning the globe for an
opportunity to play a role on the diplomatic stage, using its independence
and Swiss neutrality as calling cards.
The Davos meeting of de Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi, for example, was the
public conclusion of a lengthy, secret process in which the WEF, at the
request of its South African corporate members, successfully mediated in the
building of bridges between the business community and the ANC.
But even to WEF insiders, it is something of a mystery how Schwab, a
colourless and socially awkward man, manages to woo the world's great and
good, and to attract year after year such a wide spectrum of people.
Prestige has a lot to do with it. As one long-time observer says: 'When
Schwab rings chief executives of even the world's largest companies, they
tend to pick up the 'phone.'
However, in the past couple of years, many of those same fee-paying
corporate members have begun to complain that the WEF's political interests
have become too dominant. To them, the once casual and clublike atmosphere
of Davos has been destroyed by the invasion of large numbers of third-world
and eastern European leaders, hoping to impress both members and the press
with their pleas for aid.
Schwab and his colleagues say they have heard the grumbling. The Davos
agenda this weekend is as elevated as ever, with the theme: 'Redefining the
basic assumptions of the world economy.' But the programme has been more
deliberately focused on economic and corporate governance issues than in the
past three years  - topics of concern to members.
In addition, WEF staff have been ordered to concentrate on customer care,
preparing personal agendas for most of the 800 or so corporate chiefs who
will attend. The number of media invitations has been cut by half, and
politicians have been told they are no longer welcome unless they leave
their retinues at home.
A similar shake-out is under way with the academic and bureaucratic star
guests. In recent years, some members have felt that Schwab has gone soft on
old friends, allowing people such as Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of
state, and Karl Otto Pohl, former Bundesbank president, to continue playing
prominent roles beyond their sell-by dates.
This year, for the first time, the three co-chairmen of the annual meeting
 -John Bryan, chairman of Sara Lee Corporation, Lee Kuan Yew, senior
minister of Singapore, and Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German
Bundesbank  - are all still in office.
These changes are only the visible tip of a change in WEF policy  - to go
for quality rather than quantity. Belatedly, the organisation seems to have
realised that it has a sound base and no longer needs to chase frantically
after new members and publicity for itself. Its corporate members are a
sufficient magnet to attract senior government officials and academics.
Some members feel that the club is already too large, and a decision has
recently been made to limit the membership when it reaches 1,000 and to
become more selective. Schwab says gravely that future corporate applicants
will be assessed on the basis of their global presence, their impact on the
sector in which they operate, and the intellectual contribution the chief
executive can make.
A renewed emphasis on quality is a luxury the WEF can now afford after years
of expansion. Its finances seem to be on a sound footing, although the
organisation displays a typical Swiss reserve on the subject of money. Last
year's report from the president records in a single paragraph that income
for 1992-93 was SFr23.8m (Pounds 10.9m), expenditure SFr23.7m, with the
SFr100,000 surplus raising the foundation's capital reserves to SFr3.5m.
Membership and conference fees make up virtually all the foundation's
income. On the expense side, WEF officials indicate vaguely that the annual
Davos gathering alone eats up SFr6m. Much of this is for renting premises
and hiring temporary staff, for security and for the transportation of
members and guests.
They claim they pay only modest fees to guests, and never to politicians in
office. 'In the past 12 years, we have never paid an honorarium over
SFr5,000,' Schwab says. The WEF does pay guests' travel and living costs,
and occasionally even charters aircraft to fetch them, notably 100 from
Russia last year.
For all the complaints, the Davos gathering, much like the Group of Seven
summit of leading industrial nations or the International Monetary Fund
annual meeting, has become an institution. Top people keep coming to it
because other top people keep coming to it.
Schwab himself calls Davos a brand, with the implication that competitor
conference organisers would be unable to undermine it unless the WEF managed
it very badly over a long period.
And some of the complaints about the political circus are probably a bit
disingenuous. It seems that company chiefs like to be able to go home and
announce casually to their colleagues: 'As Chancellor Kohl was saying the
other day in Davos . . .'
Many of them also like to ski.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Right road for spending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government has been deservedly hoist on the low taxation petard
with which it undermined the Labour party at the general election. Yet the
debate, however entertaining, is not illuminating. If taxes are to be
significantly lower, public spending must also be reduced. But such a
reduction would require radicalism, something that looks unlikely from the
government and almost inconceivable from the opposition.
The government's rhetoric about the need to control public spending has not
prevented the share of general government spending in gross domestic product
from returning to where it was when Mrs Thatcher took office. At 45 per cent
of GDP in 1993-94 the ratio is, in fact, one percentage point higher than in
1978-79. This does not mean that British governments have had no success in
controlling spending: at comparable periods of the economic cycle the ratio
was still higher, at 49 1/4 per cent in 1975-76 and 47 1/2 per cent in
1982-93. It does mean its success has been limited.
Success has been particularly limited in recent years. Between 1988-89 and
1993-94, general government spending will have grown by 16.1 per cent in
real terms, while GDP will have risen by a mere 1.3 per cent. Against that
background, the only alternative to higher taxes would have been still
higher borrowing, which would mean yet higher taxes in future. The
government was right to prevent that outcome, however painful the
consequences.
Higher ratio
Against the international background, the government's achievement is not
even that poor. Last December's Economic Outlook showed that every OECD
member state had a higher ratio of government spending to GDP in 1993 than
in 1979. The UK's ratio is even below the unweighted average, which stood at
51.2 per cent in 1993.
Only three OECD countries - Switzerland, Japan and the United States - have
ratios below 40 per cent. Two countries - Denmark and Sweden - have ratios
above 60 per cent, with Sweden teetering on 73.5 per cent. In between lie
the great majority. Most European countries have ratios above 50 per cent,
the exceptions being Ireland, Spain and the UK. Germany (50.8 per cent),
France (54.2 per cent) and Italy (54.8 per cent) all bear a somewhat higher
burden than the UK (47 per cent in these figures).
The OECD also shows where the differences arise. Compared with the UK, for
example, the US spends far less of its GDP on publicly provided health and
housing. Compared with the UK, Japan spends far less on defence and income
transfers. Again compared with the UK, Germany spends far more on income
transfers, which is still truer of other northern European welfare states.
Core function
Income transfers have, in fact, become the core function of the European
state, accounting for 26.8 per cent of GDP in Sweden in 1990, 23 per cent in
Denmark, 18.5 per cent in Germany, but 13.4 per cent in the UK, 11.9 per
cent in the US and only 7.8 per cent in Japan. In European welfare states,
provision of public goods and economic services, the classic functions of
the public sector, accounts for a far smaller share of GDP than transfers.
In the UK, by comparison, the two elements are equivalent in size.
Nevertheless, the UK's situation is not so different from that of other
European states. What the Department of Social Security in a recent pamphlet
calls 'social protection' (which includes health), accounted for 26 per cent
of GDP in the European Union in 1990. At 23 per cent, the UK's ratio is
again below the European average, but not wildly so. The world's top 10
spenders on social protection are European states and all face spiralling
costs.
The European states are on a treadmill. High public spending necessitates
high taxes which undermine incentives and exacerbate poverty traps. These,
in turn, lead to still higher unemployment and yet higher public spending.
If they are to get off the treadmill, they will have to be radical. But
radicalism is politically risky. The alternatives include more precisely
drawn priorities, greater reliance on private provision and more extensive
use of charges. Failing such radicalism from their governments, all European
electorates will continue to grumble about worsening services and, of
course, higher taxes.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Cross-Channel shopping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the European Union raised duty-free allowances on cross-border
shopping a year ago, British consumers have been quick to discover the
pleasures of a single market. Lured by lower prices, they have poured across
the Channel to stock up on drink and tobacco. By some estimates, such
purchases accounted for a fifth of all beer bought for home consumption in
Britain last Christmas.
But this bonus for consumers means a loss of business for UK producers and
retailers. There is also a problem for the Treasury. It has long relied more
than most European exchequers on revenue from high excise taxes, which
account for most of the cross-Channel price differences. But the tradition
of annual duty rises, beloved by successive Chancellors, is now threatened
by the law of diminishing returns. As much was acknowledged in the last
Budget, which left rates on beer and spirits unchanged.
But that has merely prevented a large discrepancy in retail prices from
widening further. As long as it persists, a strong incentive remains for
British shoppers to go abroad, and for 'parallel traders' to import alcohol
and tobacco cheaply for re-sale - a practice which is illegal but hard to
police effectively. At some point, something has to give.
British brewers, which are particularly threatened because of their heavy
dependence on their home market, have seized the opportunity to call for a
two-thirds cut in beer duties. So far, the Treasury is unimpressed, since
the proposal would involve foregoing much more tax revenue than is being
lost because of cross-Channel shopping. The brewers' solution is also out of
proportion to the problem because pubs, which account for four-fifths of all
beer sales, face no direct challenge from cheap imports.
Inflated premiums
The growth of cross-Channel shopping may in time serve to accelerate the
decline in pub drinking already under way. But that is a trend which the
brewers have actively encouraged. Since 1980, they have raised the pub price
of a pint, before tax, 60 per cent faster than inflation, to far above the
level in supermarkets. Equally, UK brewers which charge inflated premiums
for mainstream continental lager brands have only themselves to blame if
their sales and profits are now under attack.
The pursuit of such policies, in spite of falling consumption and excess
production capacity, suggests an industry which has grown used to operating
in a captive market. That is a luxury it is less likely to enjoy in future.
While there is a strong case for removing tax anomalies, the aim should be
to minimise trade distortions, not to shelter brewers' profits from the
disciplines of international competition.
Insular attitudes
However, insular attitudes are not confined to producers. The government has
also been slow to recognise that falling trade barriers have narrowed its
freedom for manoeuvre in indirect tax policy. Indeed, it appeared to assume
until quite recently that it could muddle along with its old ways regardless
of the exigencies of Europe's single market. Witness the Thatcher
administration's insistence in the late 1980s on building a customs hall at
Waterloo station to receive arriving Channel tunnel rail passengers.
Equally nonsensical was the spectacle of Mr Norman Lamont, when Chancellor,
admonishing other countries for discriminating against Scotch whisky exports
by taxing them excessively, while subjecting the same drink at home to some
of the heaviest taxes in Europe.
In recent months increased cross-border shopping has forced other EU
members, such as Denmark, with much higher indirect taxes than neighbouring
states, to cut them substantially. The pressures on the UK to do likewise
are likely to continue. This is not a comforting prospect for a government
struggling to reduce an already large budget deficit. But at least it cannot
claim to be unprepared. The Thatcher administration, after all, made much of
the competitive benefits of low income taxes. Britain also opposed Brussels'
earlier efforts to harmonise indirect taxes on the grounds that the level
should be influenced by the market.

<TEXT>
Sir, The first paragraph of Peter Norman's otherwise accurate account
('Cross-party group of MPs backs Clarke's fiscal policies', January 20) of
the Commons Treasury select committee's report on the November Budget gives
a misleading impression because it implies that opposition MPs backed the
chancellor's fiscal policies.
In fact, the published minutes of the proceedings of the committee show that
we supported two amendments which expressed our fears about the scale of the
tax increases announced in the last two Budgets, equivalent, as the
chancellor admitted to the committee, to 7p on the standard rate of tax. We
were (and remain) concerned that the severity of these rises would not only
'bear heavily on vulnerable sections of society' but also put economic
recovery 'at risk'.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Glimmer of confidence: The hopes of Lebanon's prime minister
to rebuild the 'Paris of the Orient'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reminders of Lebanon's former glamour can still be glimpsed amid the shelled
ruins of present-day Beirut. The gutted Hotel St Georges may today be
guarded by a solitary, bored Syrian soldier where once it greeted a
high-rolling cast of Gulf Arabs, arms dealers, spies and journalists. But
beside the adjacent marina, the scions of Beirut's wealthy still gather on
sunny Sundays in a bravura display of tanned flesh, chic attire and flashy
cars.
Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, is this week seeking, during a
visit to London, to rekindle the image his country once had as the 'Paris of
the Orient'. At a meeting yesterday with Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, he achieved one of his priorities: the restoration of
government-backed export credit insurance for UK exporters to the country.
As part of his ambitious plans to rebuild Lebanon as a regional economic
centre, Mr Hariri is also pressing for aid, which so far has come in limited
quantities from the west. In the City, he will be encouraging reticent
businessmen and financial institutions to re-enter what Lebanese officials
believe will become the region's fastest-growing capital market.
Above all, Mr Hariri will argue that, since becoming prime minister in
October 1992, he has massively boosted Lebanon's confidence in itself. Peace
 -agreed between Lebanon's belligerent factions under the 1989 Taif pact,
which strengthened Moslem political power at the expense of the Christians,
and ensured by the presence of 35,000 Syrian troops - is poised to bloom
into economic growth and durable political stability.
Lebanon's economic prospects appear to be promising. Since Mr Hariri arrived
in Lebanon from Saudi Arabia, where his construction business made him a
billionaire, Lebanon's ravaged economy has begun to recover. GDP growth last
year was about 7 per cent and the same is expected for 1994. A Dollars 600m
balance of payments deficit in 1991 has turned around, to an expected
Dollars 1bn surplus for 1993. Mr Riad Salame, Lebanon's central bank
governor, says Dollars 7bn of capital which left the country in the 17-year
civil war has come back since 1992.
But the most prized indicator has been the success this month of the share
offer for Solidere, the company Mr Hariri and his advisers created to manage
the reconstruction of 1.6m sq metres of central Beirut. The offering, to
raise Dollars 650m towards the cost of a 25-year project to create a leisure
and commercial district from the rubble of downtown Beirut, was
oversubscribed by 42 per cent. According to Mr Nasser Chammaa, Solidere's
founding general secretary, more than 90 per cent of the 20,000
subscriptions came from Lebanese nationals, mostly expatriates.
Solidere is the pivotal project in Mr Hariri's rehabilitation plans. Mr
Chammaa reckons it will create up to 20,000 jobs and could boost GDP by up
to 10 per cent over the next few years. Its success raises the prospect of
tapping more of the estimated Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn that Lebanese,
living in the country or abroad, hold overseas. 'It proves there will be no
problem in raising funds for future projects,' says Mr Freddie Baz, adviser
to Banque Audi, a Lebanese commercial bank.
For its supporters, Solidere epitomises what they call the 'Hariri effect':
the confidence generated by the expertise of a man of undoubted commercial
acumen. President Elias Hrawi intended precisely that effect when he invited
Mr Hariri to form a government in 1992.
But some Lebanese are suspicious of Hariri's businessman's approach to
government, believing there may be potential conflicts of interest in a
construction magnate overseeing Beirut's reconstruction. Most distrustful
are those who claim to have been dispossessed by Solidere, which, with
government backing, forced the exchange of Dollars 1.17bn worth of shares
for the property rights of about 130,000 people owning property in those
parts of central Beirut due for development.
Hundreds of such people contest Solidere's legality, believing they have a
case for its dissolution. 'Not only did they take our land cheaply, they
took it against our will,' says Mr Omar Daouk, a litigant whose family has
run shops in the area since the 1800s.
For many, Mr Hariri's wealth is both a blessing and a bane. It has enabled
Mr Hariri to pump-prime Lebanon's economic revival - he subscribed, for
example, for 19 per cent of the Solidere shares on issue. It has also
allowed him to establish teams of staff, some working apart from government
structures, undertaking some central reconstruction tasks.
But critics argue that his wealth has enabled him to avoid what they see as
necessary reform of Lebanon's government structure. 'He has basically
decided the public administration is hopeless, cannot be reformed, and has
set up a parallel administration,' says Mr Paul Salem, director of the
Lebanese Centre for Policy Studies, an independent think-tank.
Nevertheless, even most critics accept Mr Hariri's dynamism and commercial
skills offer Lebanon the best hope of recovery from a catastrophic civil
war, costing 140,000 lives and prompting 400,000 Lebanese to flee the
country.
The danger is that Lebanon's redevelopment is seen to rest on Mr Hariri
alone. For now, there is nothing to suggest Mr Hariri will go. Few see any
domestic political challenge. The peace signed between the Christians and
Moslems in 1989 remains in place. Moreover, Mr Hariri retains the confidence
of the Syrian government, which continues to keep Lebanon firmly under its
control and has deployed 35,000 troops on its soil since the late 1980s.
This 'pax Syriana' will remain the most important factor of Lebanon's
internal politics for some time. A Syrian-policed peace in Lebanon and the
control of such anti-Israeli groups as Hezbollah are seen in Tel Aviv and
Washington as important guarantees of success in broader Middle East peace
talks. The longer-term political stability which would enable Mr Hariri to
fulfil his plans for Lebanon will be influenced primarily, therefore, by
what happens in the resumed Washington peace talks rather than anything
which might happen at home.
In the meantime, Mr Hariri's chief role is to make a success of his
rebuilding project at home, while inspiring renewed confidence in Lebanon
abroad. If he succeeds, someone might usefully consider removing the Syrian
soldier from the door of the Hotel St Georges and start reglazing its
windows.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Labour can't bank on it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you accept popular mythology, the Conservatives won the election of April
1992 because they peddled two false promises. First, the depression would
end the day after Mr John Major had returned to Downing Street. Second, the
new Tory government would cut taxes, year after year after year. This bait
may have caught some gullible voters, but many deserted the opposition
parties, or voted Conservative, for a different reason. They trusted Labour
less than they disliked the government.
In spite of everything that has happened since that contest, history could
repeat itself at the next election, which need not take place until April
1997. Never underestimate the ruthlessness of politicians in trouble. Those
of us who watched Mr Christopher Patten, then chairman of the Conservative
party, campaign with a disregard for civilised discourse that must have been
foreign to his true nature will not easily forget the experience. His
counterpart next time - perhaps Lord Archer, or a similar fairground barker
 -will not shrink from repeating Mr Patten's unlovely performance. To be
sure, the weekend figures indicating that the taxes we will pay from April
will exceed those imposed by the then Mr Denis Healey in 1978-79 diminish
the force of Conservative protestations that their instincts are to keep
taxation low. But everyone knows that Labour's natural inclination is to use
taxes as a means of redistributing income, and to tax high.
That is why it is not sufficient for the shadow chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown,
to say that the Tories lied about taxes in April 1992. Of course they did.
They always do. They may think they are honest at the time, as Mr Major says
he was in 1992, but the effect of putting taxes up after promising to keep
them down is to lead people to wonder whether they have been taken for a
ride.
If memory serves, the Conservatives not only lie, they deceive, bamboozle,
hoodwink, mislead, double-cross, trick, cheat, cozen, fiddle, diddle, tell
porky-pies and practise extreme economy with the truth. Sir Anthony Eden
bought the May 1955 election by knocking 6 old pence (2 1/2 p) in the pound
off income tax and reducing the scope of purchase tax, the precursor of VAT.
In October he took back in indirect imposts what he had given away in direct
tax relief in April.
If the subject matter of electoral falsehoods is not tax, it is the chimera
of good times around the corner. In 1959 the then Mr Harold Macmillan paid
Colman, Prentis &amp; Varley - that season's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - to promote the
Conservatives as the party of prosperity. They won. Within a year the
pre-election inflationary 'go' was followed by a post-election deflationary
'stop'. Labour's then Mr Harold Wilson had the wit to use the same ploy in
the 1966 election, which was preceded by an outpouring of spending promises
and followed by the introduction of special employment tax. The voters never
learn.
Nor, it seems, does Labour. Since 1979 it appears to have disconnected
itself from the politics of victory. If it is to achieve office in the last
years of this century it must understand that the disinclination of southern
and suburban voters to support the party of the old north is cultural. This
phenomenon has yet to be addressed by the leader, Mr John Smith. Labour has
made much progress, and got nowhere. It is no longer the purveyor of
unilateral disarmament, nationalisation, open-ended subsidies to dying
smokestack industries, long queues, shoddy service and loony left councils.
The shadow home secretary, Mr Tony Blair, has rescued it from adherence to
the closed shop and the public perception that it is soft on crime. After
Black Wednesday, the Tories cannot accuse Labour of being the party of
devaluation.
Yet Mr Smith does not look like a winner. Four times rejected, his party
remains unmodernised. The trade unions still finance it, and exert influence
at all levels. At question time in the Commons Mr Smith may enjoy taunting
the prime minister with the latest figures on taxation, but he has produced
no evidence that he is thinking of ways to diminish the social spending that
makes them necessary. Labour's Commission on Social Justice, set up for that
purpose, may find it difficult to persuade Mr Smith to accept any radical
recommendations. What is Labour's economic policy? We only know what it is
not - that is, not very different from the Tories'. It aspires to full
employment, but how will it achieve this? It eschews taxation 'for its own
sake', but what does that mean? Why, apart from seeking office, does Labour
exist?
Such questions are most felicitously addressed by Mr Blair, whose mind
stretches beyond Labour's redoubt in the public sector unions. He considers
what touches ordinary voters. That is why he is one of the few British
politicians worth taking seriously. He is not a 'one more heave' merchant,
and he is too young to be a brainwashed party hack. Mr Smith is hamstrung by
the need to put party unity ahead of other considerations. He gives the
impression that he is waiting for the elect-orate to come around to the
fair-minded, centre-right way of thinking that was infused in him 20 or 30
years ago.
It is possible that the Labour leader's policy of doing very little and
saying even less may pay off. It generates few hostages to fortune: all the
Tories can say is that Labour has no policy. Nothing that Mr Major's
government has done since April 1992 generates any confidence that it will
find its feet during the coming year or so. Labour's best argument in 1996
(the most likely election year) will presumably be that 17 years is long
enough for a Conservative administration, and that it is time to throw the
incompetent rascals out. On present form, this should have a powerful
appeal.
Mr Smith would be unwise to bank on it. An Eden-style tax cut in the
November 1995 budget, accompanied by promises of more public spending and
followed by a quick election in April 1996 would be dangerous for Labour.
However hesitant the recovery, people may be feeling better off by then. Mr
Smith might be caught high and dry. Complacency is not an attractive
election manifesto. Resting on the unmasking of Tory deceptions of April
1992 will have little effect in April 1996. In short, Labour's present
strategy of taking no risks is the highest risk of all.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: To appease is to lose in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ANDREW R A HASKINS.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I congratulate you on 'Troops out, weapons in' (January 21), your
latest courageous editorial on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since the
start of the war, European (and notably British) policy towards Bosnia has
been based on the argument that only a negotiated settlement between the
rival parties can put an end to the conflict, and that military intervention
and/or an end to the arms embargo against the Bosnian government would
merely increase the suffering. Your editorial points out clearly why this
argument is flawed. It is flawed because in the absence of an effective
military lever there is no incentive for the Serb and Croat nationalists to
negotiate in good faith. European policy has been nothing more than a
justification for appeasement: a strategy which time and again history has
taught does not succeed.
It is time for a fundamental rethink of western strategy. An equitable
outcome can only be achieved if the arms embargo is lifted, and if the
Bosnian government is given full diplomatic support. At least then it will
have the chance to fight for the survival of its people on a reasonably
level playing field. The tragedy is that western governments could have
taken these bolder steps nearly two years ago. Had they done so, 200,000
deaths might have been averted.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A pessimistic analysis of executive
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR CHRIS SMITH.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Dixon, in his swan song on MSL's latest statistics of executive
demand ('Turn of the tide is confirmed', January 19), doubts 'annual demand
will ever again rise to even near the 40,202 tally of 1988'.
In 1993 the reported total demand was 16,309, being 13.3 per cent up on
1992, and, while the rate at which the tide is coming in is as yet uncertain
(another couple of quarters information will help), a figure in excess of
19,000 is probable for 1994 (an increase of more than 17 per cent).
In the four years from June 1981 to June 1985 the index more than doubled
(recurring annual increases of 19 per cent) during a period when inflation
averaged 6.2 per cent (per the Retail Prices Index).
At this stage in the economic cycle, and with initial indications that the
previously lagging indicator of total unemployment is reacting more promptly
to increased growth (which, on the most recent evidence, is also exceeding
expectations), I feel his analysis is unduly pessimistic.
This specific index may, if it is not amended for structural changes in
recruitment methodology and employment practices (such as short-term
contracting, interim management and temporary executives) fall short of
previous highs. But there are no underlying reasons why total executive
employment in the reactive 1990s should be less than in the previous decade.
What will change is the means by which executives are obtained, reflecting
both the increasingly flexible resourcing requirements of employers and the
relative size of the particular businesses and organisations concerned.
As recently as January 1992, when I was helping a client review its banking
facilities, the bank was surprised to be questioned on the terms of an
overdraft facility at 0.5 per cent over base rate with a minimum of 7.625
per cent as it could never envisage rates coming down to these levels]

FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Free market only rhetoric in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PHILLIP OPPENHEIM MP.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Harry L Freeman falls into the trap of confusing the free-market
rhetoric of US politicians with what they do in practice (Letters, January
21).
Mr Freeman is, for example, incorrect in saying that 'the long-standing US
policy of trying to pry open' markets aims to benefit all exporters. In
fact, bilateral US pressure to open east Asian markets has mainly profited
American producers - as with the deal which increased Japan's beef import
quotas, but primarily for US beef; or the agreement by the Taiwanese to
limit rolling-stock and signalling equipment contracts for a new rapid
transit line to American companies in order to buy off US pressure.
As for President Clinton's pledge to enter negotiations to ensure Caribbean
countries are not discriminated against as a result of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, Caribbean leaders will treat this with justified
cynicism, bearing in mind that recently the US again slashed sugar import
quotas, restricting competitive Caribbean sugar sales in the US to protect
large, inefficient but politically powerful Florida sugar producers.
Perhaps Mr Freeman also is unaware of the fact that the US has just further
restricted imports of low-cost Chinese textiles, along with imports from
poor countries such as Nepal, Mauritius and El Salvador. The US also
maintains a huge array of import restrictions on a vast range of products
extending from cars (restrictions on imports from Japan) and trucks (25 per
cent tariff) to peanuts (strict import quotas to protect American farmers)
and steel (import restrictions covering most imports, including those from
Japan).
Perhaps President Clinton should begin by prying open his own markets.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Birth pangs of PIA do not augur well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR MICHAEL GOLDMAN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The complacency of the letter from the president of the Life Insurance
Association (January 21) is breathtaking in its implication that there is
nothing amiss with the selling practices of the life insurance industry.
No doubt most transactions proceed smoothly and are in the interest of the
consumer (so they should be), but what about the thousands of elderly people
talked into home income plans, the thousands of members of occupational
pension schemes persuaded to transfer to personal pensions, the thousands of
home-owners who took out endowment mortgages when repayment mortgages would
have been more appropriate?
As a writer of reports on marketing subjects I come into contact with many
industries, all of which have special problems and feel themselves to be
misunderstood, but in my experience the life insurance industry is the most
obscurantist.
Its self-regulatory organisations all too often behave more like trade
associations than consumer protection bodies and the pangs that are
attending the birth of the Personal Investment Authority do not augur well
for its future.
It has not been to the interest of the British consumer that investment and
protection have become so intertwined in the world of personal financial
services.

Sir, Having recently assisted my wife through a natural birth, it seems to
me Nigel Spivey ('No place for pregnant fathers', January 22/23) exposes his
own fears about attending his child's birth rather than expounding an
argument for general male absence at birth.
He says: 'The natural state of affairs is for women to assist women.' If he
were to shoo away the 'semi-official sisterhood' gathered around his wife,
he will eventually realise the process of natural birth may require actual
physical support; in which case one patient, dedicated husband with stamina
can be a better bet than a multitude of gender sharers.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Chabrier's buoyant opera bouffe - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1991, Opera North celebrated Emmanuel Chabrier's 150th anniversary with
an exuberant production of his 'opera bouffe' L'Etoile. This year, the
centenary of his death, Opera North promises his 'opera-comique' Le Roi
malgre lui for later; meanwhile, to ensure that appetites are well whetted,
L'Etoile is back again in Phyllida Lloyd's delectable staging.
The crisis-ridden story is impeccably silly, far-fetched but not too
complicated, with a clever text by Leterrier and Vanloo (nattily Englished
here by Jeremy Sams). The music is as buoyant, original and witty as one
expects of Chabrier - and never just tacked on: it springs straight from the
ridiculous situations, and turns them into farcical gems. It is immensely
singable, at least for singers who appreciate the 19th-century French vocal
manners that Chabrier exploits and sometimes satirises. The excellent Opera
North cast swings into it with confident relish.
They have invaluable support from Valentin Reymond, who conducts the score
with no less grace than verve, idiomatic as could be. They also survive
Anthony Ward's designs - sets and costumes alike drawn from children's
fairytale books, and shamelessly exaggerated - with unshakeable aplomb.
In the breeches-role, Pamela Helen Stephen makes the lusty pedlar Lazuli
into a carrot-haired, full-voiced, ripely accented Scot; occultly linked to
him by astrology is King Ouf, as whom the tenor Paul Nilon is a model of
knowing style. Jonathan Best's glum astrologer abets him staunchly, Mary
Hegarty's Princess is brightly assured, and the unreliable Ambassadorial
couple are reliably impersonated by Alan Oke and Kate Flowers.
But it is always the composer's voice we hear: irrepressible Chabrier, the
'amateur' musical revolutionary who quit his civil-service job as soon as he
heard Tristan (at 39), the heir of Offenbach who was far more of a musical
ground-breaker than the older mini-master. Without Chabrier's untrammelled
example - the tricky firecracker rhythms, the fractured concision, the
brusque modulations, the lush, free-floating seventh- and ninth-chords - the
Debussy and Ravel we love might have never have become the composers they
were. And then where would we be?

FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: A Quebecois statement on life - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Watermans Arts Centre, Brentford is introducing the Quebecois play La
Deposition (The Statement) by Helene Pedneault to a British audience. This
90 minute psychological thriller rewards close attention without demanding
it.
The Statement was first staged in Montreal in 1988, and reached the Avignon
Festival in 1991. It has been translated by Mark Ravina, and directed by
Astrid Hilne for The Troupe, a company formed to bring world theatre to the
UK.
An Inspector is investigating a murder. The chief suspect and the victim's
daughter, Lena, describes it as an accident 'which began in childhood and
happened 30 years later.' The play turns on the question of Lena's collusion
in her mother's death. Was it a merciful release or a vindictive blow? This
evolves into an investigation where a whole life is called into question; it
is a technique begun and perfected by Robert Browning last century in his
dramatic monologues. Here it is taken even further.
The dialogue is dense and involved. The barge-footed Inspector gradually
grows into a sympathetic figure, and the recalcitrant suspect softens into a
kind of confession. There are two clips of video evidence from Lena's
sisters: one a prim paralegal and the other a blowzy mother. This is much
more like overhearing therapy than watching drama, but no less compelling
for that. At the end, the Inspector calls for help: 'Someone's fallen apart
in front of me. I don't know how to pick up the pieces.'
As a series of images for Quebec's relations with Ottawa, the play works
very well. Behind its questions of guilt, identity and the role of the past
there are resonances which work better in Quebec than Brentford: what it is
to break free from the past, and why present questions mean past answers.
You can love and hate the place you come from.
Susan Penhaligon plays Lena; she handles the role extremely well, finding
corners for psychosis and space for sympathy. Opposite her, Simon Wright is
an understanding Inspector. The play is topped and tailed by sea sounds and
whale music, perhaps an encouragement to take the long, cosmic view.
The Statement is in repertory at the Watermans Art Centre until February 5.

At their best Peter Greenaway's films - The Draughtsman's Contract, The
Belly Of An Architect - are as good as Bunuel's and better than Jean Luc
Godard's. The trouble is that, like his Spanish and French precursors,
Greenaway tends towards not only the weird but the studiously obscure. Full
of visual interest, cleverly used music, and splendid performances (all
depending very much on the director) his work too often makes you want to
hold his head under water until he explains what he's getting at.
This applies less than usual in his modern-day revenge tragedy The Cook, The
Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, which gets its first television showing today
(10.30 C4). It stars Michael Gambon as a violent crook who lords it in his
own restaurant while his wife (Helen Mirren) has it away in the loo with
another customer.
BBC2's series, Assignment, investigates the 'Yardies", violent West Indian
criminals who operate in the US and London (7.45 BBC2). Desmond Lynam
presents a new 'infotainment' series: How Do They Do That? (8.00 BBC1).

FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Music from the soul - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in the early evening, when the traffic is still chasing round
Parliament Square, the interior of Westminster Abbey is a surprisingly
peaceful haven. It was a wise decision to hold the opening night of the
BBC's Tavener festival there, as the composer's deeply religious music needs
the hallowed air within its walls, the space afforded by its lofty majesty,
if it is to breathe.
The weekend festival was one of the annual series which the BBC devotes to
portraits of 20th-century composers. With the exception of Janacek, featured
last year, all have been living composers at a stage in their careers where
a full-scale retrospective is due. John Tavener, who is 50 this week, has
reached that point and it is a useful coincidence that he has also been
caught at the height of new-found popularity.
The success of The Protecting Veil has prompted a widespread interest in all
of Tavener's music. As his style has become increasingly spare, he has been
conveniently grouped with minimalists like Part and Glass, Gorecki and
Nyman, who have simultaneously shot to popular recognition. The irony is
that no composer is more of an individual than Tavener, treading the
solitary path of spiritual self-discovery.
His music may be repetitive like theirs, but it has arrived at this
destination from a different place and for different reasons. At Westminster
Abbey we heard the Akathist of Thanksgiving, completed in 1988 and a central
example of what the mature Tavener is writing. Over a deep, bass drone a
chorus invokes the glory of God. The music edges forward reluctantly, as if
time is no object. Its chant-like melodies are unfolded by unaccompanied
voices, sometimes overlaid by tolling bells, sometimes wafted aloft by a
numinous halo of strings.
By the end of its 90 minutes' duration, the work has achieved exultation,
but without any struggle or dialectic. Tavener has simply stated his
material and, with minor variations, re-affirmed it with increasing
glorification. Received into the Russian Orthodox Church, echoing its
diatonic chants, breathing its rarefied air, he has sought to adopt as much
as possible of its language into all aspects of his music.
How well does the music communicate? In the calm of the Abbey it seemed to
me that the simplicity and beauty of the Akathist of Thanksgiving overcame
most of the potential drawbacks, despite a structure which brings the same
material round 11 times over. The blending of the counter-tenor soloists,
James Bowman and Timothy Wilson, was suitably other-worldly. The trebles of
the Westminster Abbey Choir floated in thirds like angels. Martin Neary
directed the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra.
At the Barbican, the festival's main venue, successes and failures were
evenly balanced. Some of the miniatures - the settings of William Blake's
'The Lamb' and 'The Tiger', the Sixteen Haiku of Seferis - showed how
effective Tavener's kind of simplicity can be, a single harmony or oriental
texture being striking enough to catch the imagination. Other, longer works
outstayed their welcome. Mandelion, an organ piece, wandered aimlessly;
Palintropos, in effect a piano concerto, amused itself with atmospheric
twiddlings which add up to nothing in particular.
Perhaps Tavener is more in tune with popular movements than his ascetic
image might suggest. As a young composer in the 1960s, he came to notice
with pieces like The Whale and Celtic Requiem, both recorded on the Beatles'
Apple label. The Requiem, a popularist theatre-piece with children, was
performed on Saturday by the City of London Sinfonia under Martyn Brabbins
and brought to life a slice of the 1960s. This was the decade of rock
musicals, jazz cantatas and oriental mysticism. Soon after Tavener set out
on his own spiritual journey.
In the 1990s his popularity has surged again, this time buoyed on the wave
of enthusiasm for his cello-and-orchestra work, The Protecting Veil. Steven
Isserlis was the soloist on Sunday with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under
Gennady Rozhdestvensky, playing the music with the same unhurried lyricism
that he brought to the best-selling recording. From the esteem accorded to
Gorecki, Nyman and others, it seems that the public is hungry for music
which is approachable like this, easy to absorb, gently uplifting. Whether
they appreciate anything of the long religious quest that has led Tavener to
write it is another matter.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Abstracted memories - Recent work by Anthony Whishaw
and photographs from the Hulton Deutsch collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The curving Concourse Gallery of the Barbican is a notoriously difficult
space for painters, who would rather put a flat canvas on a flat wall. The
gallery is also enormous. But Royal Academician Anthony Whishaw, at 63 one
of our more senior and distinguished artists, fills it without apparent
difficulty, and only with his work of the last eight years.
The paintings are abstracted rather than abstract, in that they simplify and
re-order the reference they make to real experience and the visible world.
Whishaw has said of his associative landscape paintings of the earlier
1980s, that he was extremely alive to the sensation one has at the periphery
of vision in walking through a wood, with twigs and moths flicking now this
way, now that. This sense of sublimated visual activity remains, though
turned now to the movement or presence of the figure, or groups of figures,
or of waves crashing on the beach.
He refers as much to art as to nature, to Japanese screen painting and, most
of all, to the Spanish masters, from Velasquez to Picasso and Tapies. Spain
is a country and culture he finds all-absorbing. The influence is clear
enough, yet in the studio interiors and courtyards, in his reworking of
cubism, and in his stiffer handling of the paint itself, he is closer,
perhaps, to Picasso's high-cubist colleague, the Frenchman, Braque, and most
of all to Braque of the last great studio still-lifes.
And like all his heroes - like Picasso himself, Braque, Goya and Velasquez,
indeed like all and any artist - whatever else he is, Whishaw is a
symbolist, concerning himself, openly and on a grand scale, with great
themes and universal experience. Even images of the landscape or the sea,
l'immensite of Courbet, readily take on such possibilities, but here, in
such series as his 'Blind leading the Blind', they become explicit.
Memory and Reflection is the subtitle to this exhibition. Whishaw makes much
of meeting an old woman whom he came upon, sitting alone in the village of
Bulcayado, now quite deserted, that was still her home. The paintings he has
made of her, 'Reverie', sitting in her empty house or by the sea, are at the
heart of his work, as they are at the heart of this memorable exhibition.
On the upper level of the Barbican's Art Gallery is All Human Life, a
personal selection of some 500 images from the Hulton Deutsch Collection.
Bruce Bernard, the photographic historian, was left to make his choice quite
unhindered by theme or prescription, which must have been a daunting, if
enthralling, undertaking. The collection is based on the old Hulton Picture
Library, set up in 1944 as the archive of Picture Post. It has since taken
over a number of other press archives and collections, and now amounts to
something over 15 million items.
Bernard, quite rightly, has trusted to nothing more than his eye for an
image and an idiosyncratic humour that is by turns sardonic, surreal and
very funny. Victorian and Edwardian photographs are included, and the period
of selection extends to the late 1950s, but no chronology is attempted. The
substance of the show is set in the golden age of photo-reportage, from the
1920s to the 1950s and the end of Picture Post itself.
Those times were as desperate as any, and here are horrors enough to account
for them, images of destitution and disaster, brutality and carnage. Yet
always it is the personal image that haunts the imagination, not the
soldiers dead in a ditch so much as the young, rapt faces of Nazi Youth, Dr
Goebbels running from his car, Stalin smiling.
But not All Human Life is so sinister, least of all in Bernard's mischievous
eye. Life goes on even though a child crawls in the Berlin gutter, or
homeless families camp in the mud of the New Forest. The Office Window Box
must still be dressed, the invoices still despatched from the Wax-Model
factory where a disembodied hand sits on the desk. There are still children
to feed, birds to stuff, races to be run, bikes to ride on the high-wire in
the back-garden, fun to be had.
Anthony Whishaw: On Memory and Reflection; Barbican Concourse Gallery until
March 6, then on to Ayr, Exeter, Huddersfield, Dublin, Newcastle, Newport
and Bolton.
All Human Life: photographs from the Hulton Deutsch Collection; Barbican Art
Gallery until April 24.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Business and Law: Review of suits against advisers to US
fraudsters - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The right of private litigants in the US to bring aiding and abetting
actions against accountants, lawyers and other professionals with secondary
involvement in securities fraud is under review by the US Supreme Court.
Plaintiffs' lawyers and the Securities and Exchange Commission argue that
denying private actions could deprive investors of their best shot at
recouping losses. Many investors who lost money in the recent savings and
loans (building societies) crisis, for example, were only able to recover
some losses by successfully suing accountants and law firms which had
advised the failed institutions.
The case under review, Central Bank of Denver v First Interstate Bank of
Denver, involves an Dollars 11m bond issue made in 1988 for which Central
Bank of Denver served as the indenture trustee. The bonds were secured by
property, and serious questions were raised about the accuracy of the
property's appraisal before the bonds were issued. Central Bank ordered a
new appraisal but delayed it until six months after the bonds were issued.
After the bonds went into default in 1990, First Interstate, which had
bought Dollars 2.1m, sued Central alleging it had intentionally or
recklessly aided and abetted a fraudulent scheme by delaying the appraisal.

FT  25 JAN 94 / People: BZW's new managing director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW Asset Management (BZWAM), principally known for its index fund
management expertise, is hoping to promote another side of its investment
activities, through the promotion of 37-year-old Jane Platt, right.
In charge of business development for the the whole of BZWAM since 1988,
Platt moves into the new position of managing director responsible for
equity investment management, looking after and developing funds currently
amounting to around Pounds 16bn.
BZWAM chief executive Donald Brydon says it has been 'very frustrating' that
his group's reputation has been almost exclusively confined to index fund
management when Pounds 16bn of a total of Pounds 42bn are managed in an
active style.
'We have never classed (active equity management) as a separate business, it
has hitherto just been a function,' says Brydon. The other three business
areas are fixed income, headed by Celia Cull; quantitative management, with
James Woodlock in charge; and property, run by Iain Reid.
Brydon adds that since 1986, funds under management at BZWAM have grown to
Pounds 42bn from Pounds 6bn. He specifically credits Platt with helping to
achieve that rate of expansion, as well as highlighting her contribution to
the group's investment business in France and Spain.
Platt moved to BZW from Mercury Asset Management. Earlier in her career she
had previously also worked for Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management.

FT  25 JAN 94 / People: Taube shifts investment gear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Rothschild's investment guru Nils Taube, who turned 65 last year, is
relinquishing his executive directorship of investment company St James's
Place Capital. But despite that, he is adamant that he will be devoting no
less time to his role as principal investment adviser to the J Rothschild
group.
'I was getting in at 7.15 am; maybe I will now get in at 7.20,' quips Taube,
who explains that the main point is that he is changing his 'contractual
relationship' with the company, moving to receiving fees rather being a
salaried employee. For those still in doubt, he emphasises: 'I can assure
you I am not retiring.'
Taube adds that a team of just three, including himself, are now managing
marketable assets of around Pounds 1bn. He had resented spending 'more and
more time on administrative matters that had nothing to do with investment'.
He is retaining other outside posts, including his non-executive
directorship of George Soros's Quantum Fund.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Civil jurisdiction is clarified -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court has clarified the extent to which the 1968 Brussels
Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and
Commercial Matters applies to judgments given in non-contracting states.
The ECJ said the convention, and in particular rules on lis pendens (actions
pending in other courts) and related actions, do not apply to proceedings,
or issues arising in proceedings, in contracting states concerning the
recognition and enforcement of judgments given in civil and commercial
matters in non-contracting states.
The Court gave its ruling in response to questions of interpretation
referred to it by the House of Lords in the context of enforcement
proceedings relating to a judgment of the High Court of Saint Vincent.
That court had ordered the defendants, Bracco Industria Chimica, and its
chairman and managing director, Fulvio Bracco, both domiciled in Italy, to
repay a cash loan of SFr9m claimed to have been made by the plaintiffs,
Owens Bank Ltd, in 1979.
The defendants denied the existence of any loan and alleged Owens Bank
relied on forged documents and false testimony. When Owens applied to
enforce the Saint Vincent order in Italy in July 1989, the defendants
claimed the order had been obtained by fraud.
When Owens Bank later applied to an English Court for a declaration under
the Administration of Justice Act 1920 that the Saint Vincent order was
enforceable in England, the defendants again said the order had been
obtained by fraud. They also argued that the English Court should decline
jurisdiction or stay the proceedings pending conclusion of the Italian
enforcement proceedings, relying on the provisions of the Convention
relating to lis pendens and related actions.
In particular, they contended the question whether Owens Bank had obtained
judgment by fraud was an issue which would be examined in both English and
Italian enforcement proceedings.
The ECJ noted that the procedure under section 9 of the Administration of
Justice Act 1920 involved the registration of the foreign judgment so that
it could be enforced in the same way as a judgment given by an English
court. The Court also took into account that section 9 provides that a
judgment may not be registered if obtained by fraud or if it concerns a
cause of action excluded from the jurisdiction of the English court for
reasons of public policy.
If such a judgment is registered, it is open to challenge in legal
proceedings and the court dealing with the matter may consequently order the
issue to be determined by a trial between the parties.
The ECJ, thus, defined the context in which the House of Lords asked it to
interpret the Convention as proceedings intended to pave the way in one of
the states party to Convention to the execution of a judgment given in a
civil and commercial matter in a non-contracting state.
The Court ruled the Convention does not apply to proceedings for the
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters in non-contracting
states nor to an issue arising in such proceedings, such as the question
whether the judgment in question was obtained by fraud. It said the express
wording of Title III of the Convention showed the procedures for recognition
and enforcement apply only to decisions given by a contracting state.
The Court also rejected the defendants' arguments that decisions relating to
an issue arising in enforcement proceedings, such as the fraud issue, were
independent of the enforcement proceedings and should be recognised in other
contracting States.
C-129//92, Owens Bank v Bracco, ECJ 6CH, January 20 1994.
Eurocontrol escapes EC rules
In the context of Belgian proceedings in which the German airline SAT relied
on an alleged abuse of a dominant position as a defence to claims by
Eurocontrol for payment of air traffic control fees, the ECJ held
Eurocontrol was not an 'undertaking' in the meaning of EC competition rules.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of the Ladbroke board after the retirement of former
chairman Cyril Stein continued yesterday with the appointment of two
non-executive directors.
Hugh Collum, chief financial officer of SmithKline Beecham, the healthcare
group, and Derek Williams, a director of Cadbury Schweppes, are to join the
board.
Williams' assumption of full duties is to be delayed, however, because of
his participation in a rival bid to run the national lottery. Williams, 55,
is a director of the Camelot Consortium of lottery bidders. Ladbroke is a
partner of MAI in the Games for Good Causes consortium.
To avoid any conflict, Williams will only take up his position on February
14, after bids have been submitted. Between his appointment and the award of
the lottery licence, Williams will not be present at board discussions or
receive papers relating to Ladbroke's bid.
As well as being a director of Cadbury Schweppes, Williams is managing
director of the Coca Cola and Schweppes Beverages joint venture. He joined
Cadbury Schweppes in 1975 as personnel director of Schweppes Beverages. In
1980, he became responsible for manufacturing and was made managing director
in 1984.
Collum, 53, spent 17 years in the brewing industry before joining Cadbury
Schweppes, where he was finance director. He became finance director of
Beecham in 1987 and co-ordinated and implemented the merger with SmithKline
Beckman.

FT  25 JAN 94 / People: Oftel old hand set to retire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Wigglesworth, deputy director general of Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, is taking early retirement from the end of March.
Wigglesworth, 56, a popular figure in the industry, is the last survivor at
the top of Oftel from its launch in 1984. He joined the fledgling watchdog,
the first of the utility regulators and the model for the rest, from the
Department of Trade and Industry.
When Sir Bryan Carsberg, the first director general, departed in mid-1992,
Wigglesworth took the helm for nearly a year before the arrival of Don
Cruickshank, the present regulator.
Wigglesworth is likely to be succeeded by civil servant, though his job will
not be advertised publicly in the first instance: Cruickshank, himself
recruited from the private sector, is keen to have a deputy familiar with
Whitehall.
Oftel has also appointed two new directors. Christine Farnish, Cambridge
council's assistant chief executive, is to be director of consumer affairs.
A graduate of Manchester University and University College London, Farnish
started her career as Senior Research Officer at the Countryside Commission.
Sarah Chambers moves from the DTI to become director of licensing. An Oxford
graduate, she joined the DTI in 1979. For the last 18 months she has been
part of the team reviewing the future structure and ownership of the Post
Office.
Cruickshank said the new appointments would help Oftel 'cope with the
increasing number of new operators and focus on getting customers what they
want.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: When waste is not wanted - Germany's
recycling legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ROSE and DAVID PERCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has no difficulty in persuading companies to recycle packaging -
they have to do so, by law. The scale of German recycling, however, has
caused problems for other countries in Europe.
By generating large surpluses of recyclable materials, which the German
market cannot absorb, it is cheaper for recyclers to obtain waste paper and
plastics from Germany than to collect them locally.
The surpluses have also caused domestic problems for Germany: the
private-sector organisation that collects the materials has run into
financial trouble as the costs of recycling escalate.
The regulation that helped to create this situation was the 1991 Packaging
Ordinance; the government proposes to amend this around March. The latest
draft provides for a relaxation in recycling targets and allows a limited
amount of the surpluses to be incinerated to recover their energy content.
However, most of the essentials of the ordinance would remain unchanged.
The ordinance compels German producers of packaging waste to take it back
for reuse or material recycling. Incineration for energy recovery is
currently not allowed. Manufacturers, fillers, wholesalers and retailers
must take back packaging from the link below them in the chain, beginning
with the retailer, who must take it back from the consumer.
For transit packaging, the new text softens the demand for material
recycling - it will only be required where 'technically possible' and 'the
additional costs . . . are not unreasonable in comparison with other
recycling processes'. This is apparently left to the holder's judgment.
This relaxation should help waste managers who take on the collection and
recycling duties of their customers and seek an outlet through energy
incineration. However, the revised ordinance needs to make the cost
comparison clearer.
In theory the take-back rule also applies to sales packaging. In practice,
retailers avoid turning their shops into rubbish dumps by belonging to a
government-approved independent collection and separation system, which
meets set collection and recycling targets.
This system is run by Duales System Deutschland, which charges packaged
goods producers and importers a fee for the right to display a 'green spot'
on their packaging - a symbol that tells the retailer it will not have to
take back that packaging from customers. Householders separate their
packaging waste, to be collected and passed to reprocessors without charge.
DSD's fee operates as a subsidy, financing collection and separation of
unlimited quantities of packaging waste.
This charge becomes the waste manager's sole source of profit.
The new text for the ordinance alters the current Dual System's targets. At
the moment, targets cover, first, quantities collected, and second, amounts
sorted, of suitable quality material. The new text abandons collection
targets under such a Dual System, and fixes minimum recycling rates as a
percentage of total packaging marketed.
The percentages (by weight, see table) are lower under the proposed
amendment, and instead of being brought in through two stages, there are
three.
In the ordinance the sorting targets are expressed as a percentage of
packaging collected, so the more that is collected, the more has to be
sorted. The minimum recycling rate is effectively the collection percentage
multiplied by the sorting percentage.
With the exception of glass, all targets for the first stage are higher.
However, they fall from January 1 1996, the most significant reduction being
for the following three-year period to January 1 1998. For plastics, half
the minimum target must be met by techniques ensuring new use through
melting, dissolving or turning into pellets.
The new text will permit energy incineration once collection targets are
achieved. Failing this, excess materials must be sent to the public
authority for incineration as commercial waste.
In 1992, the Federal Cartel Office ruled against any extension of DSD's
activities to industrial waste. The Dual System therefore applies only to
collections from households, cafes, bars and small businesses.
A companion measure, the Marking Ordinance, would apply from July 1 1995,
after clearance by the European Commission. This would require all packaging
to be marked with the word Mehrweg (multi-trip, or reused several times) or
Einweg (one-trip). Packaging manufacturers must indicate Stofflich
Verwertbar (recyclable), Verwertbar (if recoverable in another way) or Nicht
Verwertbar (non-recoverable). Polymers must be listed separately.
For one-trip packaging, an indication must be given on the pack of the
estimated disposal cost. This, however, could mislead the consumer, who does
not have full information about the packaging's cost-effectiveness.
Another country with recycling legislation is France. In 1992 it passed a
decree for household packaging waste under which, as in Germany, the
producer must either take it back or pass responsibility to a state-approved
organisation and pay for an identifying logo.
However, the French manage to avoid some of the pitfalls of German
legislation, even in its amended form. Thus France makes membership of a
government-approved collection scheme a legal requirement for fillers and
importers, rather than relying, as Germany does, on retailers to police the
system.
To keep supply and demand roughly in balance, France gives clean energy
incineration equal status with recycling. Also commitments from sectoral
recycling organisations predetermine collection and separation volumes of
the local authorities.
French local authorities are responsible for collection, and 'green spot'
licence fees are used to help them develop their systems. Germany still
follows the expensive, inefficient line of insisting on independent
recycling.
France is preparing a separate law for industrial and commercial waste which
makes maximum use of existing collection systems, an example that Germany
should follow. And in contrast to Germany's rigid targets, France does not
prescribe targets by legislation but imposes them through the machinery for
licensing the organising agency. This allows flexibility.
Germany's recycling targets are much higher than the maximum figures in the
draft European Union Packaging Directive. The directive allows member states
to set higher targets if the Commission confirms that they avoid internal
market distortions and do not hinder compliance by other member states.
Germany opposes this condition and, if challenged, will invoke article
100(a)(4) of the Treaty of Rome, which permits national environmental
protection measures after a harmonisation measure is passed. Arguably, the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg should rule that that this refers to
the EU environment as a whole rather than Germany's national environment.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A survivor's guide to the
recovery - The UK economy may be improving, but dangers still lurk for
companies striving for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So your business survived the recession. Now comes the tricky part,
surviving the recovery. More businesses go bust as the economy starts to
recover than fail during a recession. At least that was the experience in
1981-82.
This time around the experience may be different. Insolvency figures show
that company failures are actually falling. This may be explained by the
slow pace at which the economy is improvingdespite the wave of positive
economic statistics published so far in 1994. It may also be because
businessmen and women took such a pounding over the last four years that
they are reluctant to expand.
But it is too soon to say the pattern will not be repeated. The traps of
over-trading, poor cash-flow management and under-capitalisation are in
position and ready to snare the unwary once the economy makes a more robust
recovery.
This page will return to many of these themes in greater depth in the coming
months. But today it offers a quick route map around the hazards remaining
for growing businesses as they emerge from the longest recession in memory.
Beware over-trading
'My guess is that we will see over-trading problems emerge in the next 18
months because the recovery has not been strong enough yet to get people
into trouble.'
 -Nigel Males, Turnaround partner, KPMG It is a basic tenet of business that
a company making an accounting profit can go bust even when sales are rising
if cash flow is not enough to pay suppliers. New orders involve an increase
in stocks, work-in-progress and debtors and a consequent rise in the need
for working capital. Trouble looms if you are paying suppliers before you
are paid by your customers.
Yet a recent study by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, showed an alarming
lack of understanding of how much working capital is needed to expand. Half
the companies surveyed with sales of Pounds 5m to Pounds 150m, said they
expected to grow by up to 15 per cent in the next two years. But only a
third said they planned to raise any new money or increase their overdraft.
A simple example demonstrates that such alchemy cannot work - growth is not
possible without additional capital in some form. Take a typical
manufacturing company with sales of Pounds 10m that plans to grow by 17.5
per cent over 18 months. Realistic expectations, but the impact on cash flow
is startling.
Males says that if this company had a typical manufacturing cycle and, as
one would expect, had to pay its suppliers before its customers paid their
bills, the company could need Pounds 250,000 in additional working capital
to cover the 10 weeks before cash came in from the additional sales. As this
company could well have a capital base of only Pounds 500,000, the balance
sheet would clearly be put under pressure.
If margins are improving, it is possible the company could generate enough
cash. But others may not have this luxury. 'For companies with very rapid
growth there is a problem and banks will be less keen to provide overdraft,'
says Michael Queen, a director of 3i, the development capital group.
One solution may be to resist jumping on the treadmill of trying to increase
sales rapidly (more about this in the section on pricing).
Kidsons Impey, the accountancy firm, says a preferred option might be to
invest in capital equipment. This could increase profitability on existing
business, which would then provide internally generated cash to finance the
working capital demands of future sales growth.
Either way there would be a need to raise finance.
Raise capital
'Almost the defining feature of a small business is that it is
undercapitalised.
 -Graham Bannock, Consultant to DTI Last year saw a near record number of
quoted companies raising capital through rights issues. Some were
opportunistic on the back of a rising stock market. But many companies were
seeking shareholder support to finance a recovery in sales or investment.
The same rules apply to smaller companies. But many of the unquoted
companies appear to think they can grow without extra capital.
While consultants and accountants provide anecdotal evidence that banks have
been more supportive during the latter stages of this recession, they say
companies should be under no illusions. The banks are not necessarily going
to line up to finance the next stage of growth.
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, may try to cajole banks to
lend on the strength of cash-flow projections and business plans. But it is
unrealistic to expect them to increase unsecured overdrafts to fund growth.
'In essence companies are asking for equity on an overdraft for a lousy
return,' says Males.
Bank reluctance will be greater when a company makes an urgent request for
working capital - a sure sign that it has not planned the management of its
growth. Companies that want to grow must therefore be prepared to raise new
funds, even if this means dilution of control.
'If you have a coherent plan and a well managed management team there is no
shortage of finance,' says Queen. 'What businesses will have to get used to
is that financiers will increasingly demand quality proposals.'
Dilution of an owner-manager's control need not be as great as many suppose.
Queen says that packages of funds can be put together in a relatively short
period of time. For example, a company needing Pounds 500,000 might only
have to raise Pounds 150,000 in equity, while the balance could be provided
by the government's small loans guarantee scheme and overdraft.
Avoid under-pricing
'Many companies are doing a lot of bad business which is not profitable.
Most companies would be more profitable if they were a little bit smaller.
 -John Winkler, pricing consultant, Winkler International Possibly because
of the slow pace of recovery margins and profitability are hardening,
according to Queen. But there is a great temptation as orders begin to
reappear for order-starved companies to grab any business that comes along.
This can be fatal.
Companies should be rebuilding margins, but accepting any orders or giving
unnecessary discounts in order to secure them is exactly what the company
does not need. First, low-margin business uses capacity that could be used
for higher-margin contracts later; a 1 per cent price cut for a company
earning 10 per cent net margins leads to a 10 per cent reduction in that
margin.
Conversely, as the accompanying diagram shows, the most effective way to
rebuild margins is to put prices up. Cutting costs is almost as effective
and the least efficient way is to increase sales.
That said, pricing strategies need to be seen in an industry context.
Winkler says downward pressure on prices is much more intense than a year
ago, particularly for manufacturers who are large OEM (original equipment
manufacturer) suppliers.
If a business has survived the recession it will typically have already cut
costs, and removed overheads. But such businesses are increasingly faced
with demands from large customers for immediate 5 per cent price cuts and
the same in each of next two years.
Winkler says that rather than reducing this pricing pressure, the end of
recession has actually added to the problems - as orders increase, so the
biggest customers are demanding even more price cuts.
The only solution is to resist being 'seduced by volume' and to avoid
becoming dependent on one customer for more than a certain proportion of
sales.
'The only way in the long run is to be able to turn round to the customer
and stick two fingers up,' he says. 'You have to get yourself structured -
by putting all that business though one line or one plant - so that you can
walk away from the business.'
Winkler's advice to smaller companies is; 'Paradoxically don't worry too
much about market share; worry about profitability and margin management.'
Beware your bank
'If you are under water on your security, don't pay large amounts into you
account at one time. This could put your bank manager in the position where
he has to pull the plug'
 -Anonymous consultant Few banks would admit it, but companies in financial
difficulty may be more exposed to their banks when they start to recover
than in the depths of recession.
Company X's overdraft might have risen at the same time as the value of its
security was falling during the recession. As the recovery gathers pace it
finally receives a large cheque from a customer. If paid into the account,
it would not be unknown for a bank to take the opportunity to cut the
company's overdraft limit. While not actually pulling the plug, the bank
would effectively prevent company X from continuing to trade even though
prospects were improving.
Banks and accountants publicly say the best way around this, as in many
things, is to keep the bank well informed of likely cash movements. Ideally
the bank could be asked for an undertaking that the line would not be cut.
But privately consultants and equity providers say companies are hugely
exposed in these circumstances and need to protect themselves even at the
risk of upsetting relations with the bank.
One option is to pay large payments in slowly so that the overall overdraft
comes down only marginally. Another is to pay large cheques into a different
bank account.
Neither solution is ideal and again better planning would help. Just as a
company would never dream of becoming dependent on one customer or one
supplier, nor should it become dependent on one source of finance.
Review and consider
Factoring and invoice discounting. Companies, particularly fast-growing
ones, should consider using these two alternatives to the traditional
overdraft. Both are flexible, compared with an overdraft, as the size of the
facility generally increases in line with sales growth. One disadvantage is
that they can be expensive - possibly a third more than overdraft finance.
Recognise pressures on management. Queen believes managements are going to
have to live through times that will be as stressful and demanding as they
went through when the recession first hit. Having pared away layers of
management and sales staff, chasing new orders could stretch management
resources while taking on new sales staff will increase overheads before
orders are actually won.
Additionally, managers may be poached by competitors as sales increase.
Companies should review compensation packages for key people and consider
share option schemes to tie them in.
Review marketing strategy. Having survived the recession, the shape of the
market served may have changed dramatically. Some competitors will have gone
to the wall, others will have been greatly strengthened. Others may have
avoided cutting deeply into development budgets and will be bringing out a
new product range. In short, companies should not assume they can resume
pre-recession levels of sales or margins.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (5): Shift to client
power puts curb on costs - Diana Bentley investigates attitudes to
alternative billing and value for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Times change. In the ebullient 1980s large legal fees often merged
imperceptibly into total transaction costs and were accepted with the
optimism and confidence which characterised most of the decade.
But the grim realities of the recession have fostered new attitudes to
lawyers' remuneration, and established practices unlikely to be discarded
even in improved economic conditions.
'There has definitely been a shift in power to the client,' says John de
Forte of de Forte Associates, consultants to the profession. 'The pressure
on costs which started in other fields like auditing really predated the
recession - the growth in the 1980s intensified competition and caused the
breakdown of loyalty to advisers but the recession has accelerated the
changes,' he says.
Methods of costing which were considered common by late 1993 show a marked
difference from the 1980s. They reflect the flexibility and control now
considered to be important elements in managing legal services. It is
incumbent on in-house lawyers especially to monitor and reduce legal costs.
Most recent trends indicate that lawyers and clients have increased the
efficiency and reduced the cost of the delivery of legal services, but Mr de
Forte believes that new practices, are not cyclical, but structural, and
here to stay.
While most commercial and litigation work has traditionally been costed on
an hourly fee basis, 'Generally there is now a disenchantment with hourly
rates,' says Derham O'Neill of Clifford Chance, London. Hourly rates for
large City firms can average Pounds 260 for a partner, Pounds 140 for an
assistant; or Pounds 170 and Pounds 100 respectively in the provinces.
'Regional firms have done well recently, often because of their lower hourly
rates,' notes Mr de Forte.
Rates now are often agreed before work is begun, and are subject to
negotiation. Despite the fact that rates for partners or senior lawyers may
vary within a firm to reflect seniority or the complexity of work, many
clients, (including government bodies) prefer to strike one rate for all
partners for simplicity, and similarly for different levels of support
staff.
The practice of calling for competitive quotes from candidates for work has
had a greater impact. This has become commonplace, although many firms
remain uncomfortable with the practice. 'Tendering has always been used -
especially by government bodies, but its use has been extended recently,'
explains Mr O'Neill.
The stimulus has been, largely, dissatisfaction with high fees and the
uncertainty which purely hourly costing causes. Though tendering may be
dispensed with where highly specialised skills are required, it is
established as a sensible means of selecting legal services where a range of
firms provide equal expertise and experience.
But price is not, and should not always be, the deciding factor in
selection. Other key questions, says John de Forte, are how the firm will
prevent 'over-lawyering', and guarantee the proper relationship between the
matter and the expertise it requires. 'Clients are increasingly keen to get
value for money,' says Derham O'Neill. 'That can mean the selection of fewer
firms, but ones which can deliver appropriate quality - whether for
specialised or routine work.'
Diana Miller, Legal &amp; General group legal services manager, agrees. 'The
quality of the advice is always paramount and in-house counsel are well
placed to judge it, but we also consider closely the services we want, and
generally need service that is cost effective,' she says.
Another marked trend is the move to fixed fees, or fees agreed for the whole
job, but they also present problems for firms: 'Clients like fixed fees -
lawyers find them difficult,' says Derham O'Neill.
While lawyers' experience of the average relevant transaction can suggest
the appropriate fee, external factors can invalidate estimates causing
problems for clients and lawyers. 'Lawyers need to get better at developing
fuller specifications on what is and what is not covered by the fee,' Mr
O'Neill adds.
For a proper assessment of value for money, clients often need more
information on what the fee covers. Usually, distribution and use of
resources is critical. The awkward question remains: who bears the
additional cost where the fixed fee is understated, but capping (the
practice by which the firm agrees to take the risk on the override) is not
yet common in the UK.
On top of hourly rates, premium billing - or the addition of a lump sum to
reflect the complexity of the case and degree of responsibility - was common
in the 1980s, but Diana Miller says that premiums are now used less; the
market for legal services is more competitive, and it is more usual for
clients to expect a discount if for some reason the matter does not proceed,
or is unsuccessful.
For companies rationalising their legal services and able to provide regular
work of a predictable type, volume discounts can secure efficient services -
their growth is a sign of more flexible billing practices. Even given these
charges, the profession can look for no comfort from its most senior
members.
As recently as October 1993, in an address to the Bar's annual conference,
Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, attacked the fees charged
in particular to large corporate clients by solicitors and barristers in
contentious matters which, he said, were often out of all proportion to a
reasonable rate for the job.
Elsewhere, particularly in the US, where excessive billing has fostered the
growth of legal cost audit services, the way in which lawyers charge is
similarly being scrutinised. But in the US, too, options for charging are
greater.
Contingency fees for litigation have long been permitted in the US. Banned
in England as contrary to public policy, they are not permitted, either, in
civil law jurisdictions such as Germany, France and Belgium. Despite
arguments that they improve access to legal remedies, recent utterances from
Lord Taylor and others who fear they may boost speculative litigation,
suggest that contingency fees are unlikely to be approved in England.
But some formal changes are occurring. By this spring, a conditional fee
system approved by the Lord Chancellor's department will be permitted, under
which a lawyer may charge an 'uplift' or percentage of the normal fee where
the action is successful, but such fees will be restricted to personal
injury and insolvency cases.
The trend towards more efficient delivery of legal services, with manning as
an important aspect of this, should continue. Mr O'Neill expects that there
will be increased pressure to appoint smaller teams on matters involving
more multi-skilled lawyers.
For law firms, this will require broader training and an emphasis on highly
organised integrated delivery of services to reduce client costs. 'What
clients want is transparency and a clear idea about how work will be handled
and by whom,' he says.
Ms Miller of Legal &amp; General agrees. 'Legal fees are the same as any cost in
a business - suppliers of services can't bill indiscriminately, but need to
provide full information of how they charge and demonstrate they are cost
effective.'
Monitoring of costs is another area where improvements could be made to
ensure cost effectiveness, John de Forte says. Law firms need to provide
information in advance, details of current billing to date, work in progress
and anticipated overall fees compared to budget.
'Regular billing is an increasing trend and a good one which requires
discipline,' Derham O'Neill remarks. Overall, Mr de Forte says, controlling
costs should be just be one aspect of how you manage the whole relationship.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (6): Mediation is
quicker and cheaper - The UK is one of several countries following the US in
alternative dispute resolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Conflict is eternal,' notes Tony Willis, managing partner for litigation at
Clifford Chance - a good vantage point from which to make the observation.
But as impatience with the problems of litigation mounts, it is not
surprising that the UK is following the US lead in embracing alternative
dispute resolution (ADR) as a means of resolving contentious matters.
'Essentially, the heavy costs, delays, uncertainties and unwieldy processes
of litigation common to all common law countries are the main reasons for
people turning to ADR,' says Professor Karl Mackie, chief executive of the
Centre for Dispute Resolution (CEDR) in London. As he explains, 'the
evolving business culture characterised by rapid change, emphasis on fast
responses and getting value for money set against a Dickensian legal system
make a powerful cocktail for change.'
Mr Willis, who is himself experienced in ADR, confirms that the problems of
litigation are now often unacceptable to clients and advisers.
While in the US the term ADR usually includes binding arbitration, in the UK
it normally refers to non-adjudicatory techniques. 'For commercial
disputes,' observes Professor Mackie, 'mediation, which bears a close
resemblance to negotiation, is overwhelmingly the most popular ADR form in
the UK.'
Nevertheless, other techniques may be suitable for particular disputes.
Executive tribunals - called mini-trials in the US, and more formal in
nature - involve case appraisal by executive evaluators and a neutral
chairman; the judicial appraisal scheme launched recently by CEDR, similar
to the US 'rent-a-judge' system, provides retired judges and lawyers to
assess the legal merits of a case and to narrow the issues for those
considering litigation.
Though unsuitable in some cases, for example, where injunctive relief is
required, ADR generally offers many advantages over litigation, including a
wider range of solutions, a better control of risk and confidentiality.
Another significant benefit, says Roger Myddelton, Grand Metropolitan's
group legal director, is that ADR can help preserve the commercial
relationship because it need not involve allocations of fault. 'The process
looks forwards rather than backwards.'
But it is in the cost area where ADR's benefits are especially tantalising.
'For a major matter in the commercial court, costs can run into millions of
pounds,' says Mr Willis.
Costs at CEDR are based on the amount in dispute and range from several
hundred to over a thousand pounds a day, depending on the amount in dispute.
Most mediations, however, settle in one to three days: a recent
CEDR-arranged mediation of a dispute involving Pounds 27m, set for a 12-week
hearing, lasted just one day.
In the US, as in England, about 90-95 per cent of filed cases are resolved
before trial, so there is often little reason for companies not to try ADR
early on. But ADR is a more recent phenomenon in the UK than in the US.
Since its launch in 1990, CEDR has had some 360 cases, worth approximately
Pounds 1.5bn, referred to it, and mediation has a 90-95 per cent success
rate. 'After some initial reluctance ADR's growth rate shows a steep
increase,' says Professor Mackie. 'The influence of a skilled trained
mediator means it is much more powerful than private negotiation.'
The recent experience of Colin Gilbert, group legal director of Eurocopy,
bears this out. CEDR arranged a mediation for the company's Pounds 300,000
dispute involving a client and three leasing companies. The trigger to try
ADR was the desire to preserve the client relationship. Mr Gilbert says: 'I
thought there was little common ground, but I was astounded.'
The matter was resolved in just one day, with the parties representing
themselves. Costs were about Pounds 1,000 each. Mr Gilbert is experienced in
litigation; his estimate of legal costs on the matter was about Pounds
40,000 each. Surviving the experience successfully has cemented the
relationship between the parties, he says.
Most CEDR cases are domestic, but its international referrals are growing -
a consequence of the growth of international trade, the complexities of
cross-border litigation and the growing recognition of ADR's value.
Elsewhere, the trend is similar. Sydney is the home of the Australian
Commercial Disputes Centre, established with government backing in 1986. New
York has one of the oldest ADR centres: the Centre for Public Resources
(CPR). Interest is growing elsewhere. CEDR has recently received a European
Commission grant to consult on the development of ADR in continental Europe.
Yet despite the increasing interest in ADR among the private sector, and the
high settlement rates in litigation, courts in England until now have
provided no incentives to settlement. As Mr Willis of Clifford Chance points
out, while in Germany and France judges may intervene to influence the
parties to settle cases, in England they do not do so. 'But ADR can provide
the missing element,' he says. It may now do so.
Aware of public dissatisfaction with litigation, legal regulators are
beginning to recognise ADR.
The commercial court has now established a court-annexed ADR scheme,
prompted by the recommendations of the 1993 Heilbron Report on the civil
courts (which was damning in its findings). Legal advisers to court
litigants must ensure that parties are informed of the most cost-effective
means of resolving particular issues and disputes.
The commercial court clerk keeps a list of ADR services. This includes
numerous former commercial court judges and ADR bodies such as CEDR.
Prof Mackie notes that while the Lord Chancellor's department has expressed
an interest in ADR, no formal approach for discussions on the subject has
been made to CEDR.
Experts say that parties must be willing to seek an agreed solution for ADR
to be effective - but the spectre of full litigation is a spur. 'ADR nearly
always works better in conjunction with traditional means of adjudicative
dispute resolution, or at least with their availability,' says Mr Willis.
'ADR is not a panacea, and the sometimes arduous disciplines it requires
need to be learnt.'
While the take-up rate of ADR in England has been faster than in the US, Mr
Willis believes that the spread of business people with a detailed knowledge
of the area remains thin. Top management is likely to be most interested,
given its responsibilities, although the US practice of some chief
executives pledging to endeavour to resolve disputes by ADR may not take off
so soon in the UK.
Still, Mr Willis says that in many cases ADR presents a better solution in
resolving disputes and there is growing experience in the field. Education
and familiarity remain the key. 'People's scepticism is usually overcome
when they appreciate the system's common sense, simplicity and
effectiveness,' says Professor Mackie.
In-house lawyers have long seen effective dispute management as important to
their role. GrandMet's Mr Myddelton fosters ADR.
Of those in private practice, Professor Mackie says, 'lawyers have a
constructive role to play in ADR but some may feel there is no financial
incentive to encourage its use, so clients also need to be more assertive
with legal advisers.'
Nevertheless, he is optimistic. 'As lawyers become more experienced in ADR
they will develop a better sense of how it can contribute to their practice.
We are on the verge of a big growth in ADR.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (7): The neighbours
start to encroach - Accountancy's role in legal matters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been discreet surveillance over the last year of the London
offices of Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, by its curious
competitors.
The reason is an intriguing new extension to the premises which looks
strongly as though it is part of the firm, and yet which maintains an
independent stance.
It reflects a powerful new development in the growing trend for accountancy
firms to be involved in legal issues, in a way that has put some law firms
on the defensive.
The entity is Garrett &amp; Co, a small firm of lawyers based in Andersen's
building, sharing its logo and given initial financial support by the
accountants who have taken it under their wing.
But Garrett is registered with the Law Society, and practises independently
as a firm. Its partners are economically detached from their accounting
neighbours.
It gains from the relationship by having work referred work from Andersen's
worldwide network. Clients are not automatically sent to Garrett if they
need a lawyer in London, but those without any other strong preference may
well be steered in its direction.
Garrett is one of the more advanced attempts in the UK to link accountants
and lawyers. Intrigued rivals across much of the rest of Europe would be
less surprised and more bemused by the interest in changes in London.
Andersen already has well-established links in France and Germany. Several
other firms have similar links in more sympathetic jurisdictions.
The extreme position is reached in France. In spite of the presence of a
highly-regulated, segmented market for professionals in different
specialisms, KPMG Peat Marwick is linked to Fidal, the largest law firm in
the country. It also has links with law firms in Belgium, Italy, Spain and
Switzerland.
Roger White, senior tax partner with KPMG in the UK, stresses that Fidal
remains independent but that there is a great deal of cross-referral of
work. 'It reflects the desirability of delivering a whole range of services,
and ensuring a client does not go elsewhere,' he says.
In Germany, a more relaxed regime prevails than in France. Mixed
partnerships are widespread, particularly among medium-sized firms. They are
permitted provided each of the professions represented is governed by a
satisfactory set of ethical codes.
In the UK, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has
since 1992 allowed non-accountants to be partners in chartered accountancy
firms - up to one quarter of the total number.
Firms - which traditionally got around the barrier by hiring non-accountants
as partners in all but name - have taken advantage of the relaxation to
bring in actuaries, consultants, and large numbers of both barristers and
solicitors.
Some institute officials argue that they would have no problem allowing the
introduction of full legal services into accountancy firms. That points the
finger towards the Law Society as the stumbling block for change.
However, it is unlikely that even the institute would allow the majority of
partners in a firm to be non-accountants, at which point its own ability to
regulate would be called into question, and its professional monopoly
sacrificed.
There are signs of dissatisfaction with the current arrangements. An inquiry
by the Office of Fair Trading expressed concern that the existing
restrictions on professional practice might be anti-competitive.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has also
expressed concern in the past about the anti-competitive nature of the
status quo, with little apparent effect.
Equally, across the European Union, senior officials had suggested the idea
of a new cross-border, multi-disciplinary partnership. But Mr John Heggarty
of the Federation of European Accountants in Brussels says the proposals
were too restrictive and seem now to have withered away.
As a result, it would seem that, despite some political rhetoric, there is
far more likelihood that commercial pressures rather than governmental
regulation will most affect the position of links between lawyers and
accountants over the next few years.
Part of the problem for lawyers is that they have traditionally been
reluctant to market themselves. Accountants were helped by a far earlier
relaxation in professional restrictions on marketing in the early 1980s in
the UK, which gave them a head start.
As one observer puts it: 'In Germany it was difficult enough until recently
to have the same firm operating in Cologne and Bonn. The lawyers seem more
afraid of each other than of accountants. They have been much less willing
to work in large practices.'
That is not the case in the US, of course, where lawyers have tended to be
far more aggressive, leaving accountants as second-class 'bean-counters'.
Law firms in North America have grown enormously during the 1980s, and tend
to take the lead in both insolvency work and tax advice, for example.
The shift of accountants into the preserves of the law does not mean that
lawyers themselves are necessarily under threat, so much as the way in which
they have traditionally organised.
There are distinctive ways in which each group of professionals can find a
niche. Many areas of the law are of no interest to accountants. Even in
areas where there is a strong appeal, most notably tax work, the lawyers may
still often be needed to deal with interpretation of law, and the
accountants more with computations.
Equally, accountancy firms are hiring growing numbers of lawyers to work
alongside their own specialists in providing work to clients. However, their
ability to practise law is then restricted: notably they are not able to
make representations in courts, although they can before bodies such as the
Inland Revenue Commissioners.
That is not to say that the accountants do not want to encroach further.
Roger White of KPMG says: 'I find it difficult to believe that we would
become a major law firm. But we would like the ability to deliver some basic
legal services that might enhance our tax practice, such as the ability to
buy and sell land and draw up employee contracts and sale agreements.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (3): Marriages of
convenience - A look at cross-border corporate joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANA BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like marriages of convenience, joint ventures owe more to the parties'
perception of the relationships' worldly benefits than to more altruistic
motives.
But while joint ventures are of increasing importance in the European Union
for sound business reasons, they also involve a difficult balancing act for
regulators - especially for the EU, as it seeks to reconcile its need to
achieve the single market with its desire to maintain effective EU
competition.
Despite the recession, the number of 1991-1992 joint ventures declined more
slowly than takeovers and mergers in the EU. They also have a predominantly
cross-border character.
Community and international operations accounted for 72 per cent of total
joint ventures in 1991-1992. French firms predominated in joint venture
activity, followed by Germany and then UK companies - but they are also a
popular method by which Japanese and US firms increase their growth in
Europe.
Overall, the national, EU and international joint ventures across 12
industry sectors doubled in the five years to 1990. Increases in the
chemical, electrical and automotive industries were most pronounced.
Political factors have stimulated international trading. 'The advent of the
EU single market and the opening up of the former Soviet Union, China and
Eastern Europe to western and other investors, have contributed to the
recent increase in cross-border joint ventures,' says Jim Wheaton of
Clifford Chance, the London law firm.
But, given heightened trading opportunities, what is making joint ventures
so alluring? 'A common reason for engaging in joint ventures is to enter new
markets,' Mr Wheaton says, 'and the indications are that this trend is
rapidly increasing.'
Local knowledge, facilities, labour and customers can be provided through
local venture partners. 'Making a product in your own market and sending it
out into the world is increasingly under challenge,' says Brian
Woods-Scawen, corporate finance partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants.
'Companies need to understand markets from the inside, and joint ventures
also permit greater control than employing local agents and distributors.'
Accelerated technological change has often forced huge investment in
research and development. Organisational size has become critical in
corporate competitiveness, and so has the need for rationalisation and
restructuring. Fears of protectionism also prompt local alliances. Now, even
the biggest companies may lack time and talent for solo efforts. Joint
efforts also reduce risk.
'Administratively, joint ventures are more complicated, but constraints in
time, money, manpower and knowledge are all factors in considering joint
ventures,' says Wolfgang Schneider, assistant general counsel at Ford
Europe. Ford's alliances cover a spectrum of different aspects of the
business, from the production of components to the manufacture of a whole
vehicle.
'Joint ventures are usually prompted by numerous factors, but the percentage
of each factor varies with each case,' says Mr Woods-Scawen, 'and
understanding these reasons and choice of partner is often more important
than the precise structure.'
Despite the popularity of joint ventures, in the EU there are attendant
regulatory hurdles involving competition law. The EU's competition policy is
central to its aims, but as the EU is keen to foster efficiency gains in EU
industry, the past four years have seen an improvement in regulatory
treatment in the area.
Despite the level of merger activity, it was only with the Merger Regulation
of 1989 that specific EU merger control appeared. Mergers exceeding
threshold amounts of corporate turnovers are subject to compulsory
prenotification, but notifications must be dealt with rapidly and under the
'one-stop shop' principle.
Qualifying mergers are considered at EU level and do not usually involve
national authorities. The European Commission must decide within a month if
the transaction is acceptable. If it gives rise to serious doubts about its
competitive effect, it will be subject to a a detailed investigation for up
to four months. The record of approvals, however, is good. About 90 per cent
of transactions are approved at the first stage, after which they may be
approved subject to conditions.
Aligned to the merger policy, and closely affected by it, is EU policy on
joint ventures. EU competition law, however, differentiates between
concentrative and co-operative joint ventures. If the venture is
concentrative and threshold provisions of the Merger Regulation are met, the
venture must be notified under the Merger Regulation - and attracts the
one-stop treatment.
Co-operative joint ventures are less fortunate. Outside the scope of the
Merger Regulation they are assessed under the Rome Treaty rules on
anti-competitive agreements and abuse of monopoly power. The EU's
jurisdiction is not exclusive, and transactions may be examined as well by
relevant national authorities - a time-consuming process with uncertain
results.
'There is a crucial difference of treatment of the two forms of joint
venture,' says Michael Reynolds of Allen &amp; Overy's Brussels office, 'and it
is complicated by the fact that joint ventures take many forms.'
Jointly owned companies are the most popular. But partners may only put part
of their businesses into a new entity, contributions may be of a different
nature, and many also take place between traditional rivals.
A venture is considered concentrative if it performs, on a lasting basis,
all the functions of an autonomous economic entity. It is considered
co-operative in nature if it does not constitute such an entity - or if,
although it does constitute such an entity, it gives rise to co-ordination
of competitive behaviour by the parents in relation to each other or in
relation to the joint venture.
Jim Wheaton says: 'Leave parents with some involvement in the market, even
downstream or upstream, and there is a risk that there will be some
restraint on competition between parents or that there will be an impact on
third parties.'
It was the level of joint venture activity which made EU authorities
reassess their procedures. 'The success of the EU Merger Regulation
highlighted the failure of the commission to set up a satisfactory mechanism
to appraise co-operative joint ventures, Mr Wheaton adds.
Now the EC has improved its treatment of these alliances; from January 1993
the commission has been obliged to indicate - within two months of a
co-operative venture notification - whether it believes the venture is
compatible with EU competition laws or gives rise to serious doubts, and
requires further examination.
The EC's decision, however, is not binding as it is in relation to mergers.
Nonetheless, at national level, little progress is being made. Clearance is
needed under the competition laws of individual member states for
co-operative joint ventures. Because member states laws differ, applications
need to be tailored to their individual requirements. National rules on when
these laws apply also vary; in some, it is necessary to have a party with an
office in the state but in others sales only are required.
National authorities, experts say, can be tougher than the EC, as they are
looking at their own national markets rather than at the EU or the
international picture. The necessity for national appraisal, Michael
Reynolds says, 'is often a tortuous, fairly unpredictable route. One
national authority alone can hold you up.' Led by the OECD, there is some
talk of the need to harmonise national rules, but little progress is
apparent.
However, those states which have not had competition laws until recently,
such as Italy and Spain, have modelled their laws on EU laws. But Germany
and the UK have long had quite distinct competition laws. Attempts to
harmonise them may prove difficult.
While the distinction between co-operative and concentrative joint ventures
is often a fine one, differences in regulatory treatment remain significant.
But experts claim there is scope for structuring deals to ensure that they
are within the merger provisions - so the earlier the advice is sought, the
better. The setting up of a jointly owned company with its own finance and
sales force, making it an autonomous entity so that the parents withdraw
permanently from the market, is akin to merger - and unlikely to restrain
competition between parents.
A third party can be introduced to ensure that the deal meets merger control
thresholds. 'Clients are often willing to alter the commercial structure to
some extent to get different regulatory treatment,' says Mr Reynolds.
Still, companies understand the remaining hazards of the present regimes.
'The EU authorities have made an appreciable effort, involving self-imposed
disciplines, to improve the treatment of mergers and joint ventures,' says
Wolfgang Schneider of Ford. But he believes an even clearer framework could
be sought.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (1): Birth of a
business - Large law firms in New York and London now earn as much as 40 per
cent of revenue from work with an international element. But expansion
overseas is expensive. Will a handful of powerful law firms dominate global
practice?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE

<TEXT>
If the large Anglo-American law firms which dominate the international legal
services market ever doubted that the practice of law changed from a
profession to a business during the boom years of the 1980s, the recent
recession on both sides of the Atlantic can have left them in no doubt.
As spending on legal services in the 1980s in the US alone moved inexorably
through the Dollars 100bn a year mark in a welter of mergers and
acquisitions and property deals, lawyers must have felt they were in clover.
It meant hard work and long hours, but fees rocketed and so did profits. The
earnings of senior partners scorched past those of their counterparts in
finance and industry. Legends were born: Martin Lipton, senior partner of
New York's Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz, inventor of the 'poison pill'
defence; Joseph Flom, senior partner of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom,
king of M&amp;A. If this was business, then business must be easy.
The recession changed that - probably for good. For the first time, lawyers
were exposed to chill winds of competition as they fought for the dwindling
supply of high value work to drive the bottom line.
Clients who had stuck like limpets became fickle when legal services were no
longer in short supply. Forced to cut costs themselves to cope with the
economic downturn, clients haggled over fees. If they didn't get what they
wanted they went elsewhere. Profits stalled; law firms were forced to cut
staff. There was no more talk of huge Anglo-American law firms dominating
the international legal services market. The law business pulled in its
horns.
The recession held another lesson for lawyers - they are only just coming to
terms with it as recovery sets in. The legal services marketplace in both
Europe and the US is oversupplied; too many lawyers are chasing too little
work.
In spite of recent statements by Mr Flom that another boom in corporate
deals may be just around the corner, and the optimism expressed by Robert
Harman of Travers Smith Braithwaite, the City of London solicitors - which
is mirrored by others - that lawyers in Europe can look forward to an
increase in cross-border deals as business begins to adapt to the single
market - lawyers recognise that if they are to grow their businesses in the
1990s, they need new markets.
For most of them that means they must look overseas to the emerging markets
of south east Asia and eastern Europe. The problem which they all face,
however, is how best to service these markets and secure a slice of the
cake.
After three lean years, most firms simply do not have the resources to
finance and staff new overseas bases. But of the dozen or so on either side
of the Atlantic which do, only a handful see the future in establishing
international practices along the lines of the Big Six accountancy firms.
At the moment only Baker &amp; McKenzie (1,640 lawyers, speaking 60 languages,
based in 55 offices in 33 countries) can stake a claim to be a truly global
legal practice. But others make no secret of their ambitions in that
direction.
By the year 2000, they believe that global legal services will be dominated
by fewer than 10 US and UK firms. It is not hard to identify most of the
candidates.
From the UK: Clifford Chance, Freshfields and possibly Allen &amp; Overy if it
eventually merges with France's Gide Loyrette Nouel.
From the US: B&amp;M, Skadden Arps, Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue, White &amp; Case,
Shearman &amp; Sterling, Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton and Coudert Brothers.
Bruce Buck, head of Skadden's London office, believes the trend towards
global law firms is unstoppable. The business community is getting smaller
and volume of cross border work is growing fast. The legal profession must
adapt accordingly; firms which do not do so will be left behind.
Skadden's current strategy is to be able to practise local law in those
jurisdictions where the firm can add value for clients and make money at the
same time. But there are restraints on the speed at which global expansion
can be achieved - particularly, he says, in ensuring the quality of the
service provided.
Inconsistent quality of work is an accusation that has been levelled at
Baker &amp; McKenzie over the years by competitors deriding its unusual
structure of knitting local lawyers in different countries into its
international network. John McGuigan, B&amp;M's chairman, accepts that quality
is very important and that poor work done for a multinational client in
Bogota could damage relationships in more important markets such as Europe
and the US.
'We're only as strong as our weakest link', he concedes. But he feels the
quality issue can be over-emphasised. Imposing the way in which business is
done in one location or another is wrong because it fails to recognise that
there are different degrees of sophistication in the various legal systems
of the world, that local lawyers' qualifications may not be up to the
standards of the US and Europe, and that different issues are relevant in
ensuring clients get the right service.
'Some US banking lawyers believe that what they need to do in Jakarta is to
produce the same pile of closing documents they would in New York. They're
wrong,' he says.
UK firms with similar global ambitions believe that clients welcome the
ability to be able to use their own lawyers in foreign jurisdictions.
'They like it, provided they are going to get a service just as good as a
good local firm plus all the benefits of using an integrated firm with
knowledge of their business and with whom they have good relations at HQ,'
says John Grieves, senior partner of Freshfields.
But Mr Grieves and others accept that there may be more than one way of
dominating global legal services in future. Firms such as Linklaters &amp;
Paines and Slaughter and May in London, and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Davis Polk
&amp; Wardwell and Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore in New York believe it is unnecessary
to have offices world-wide in order to dominate the marketplace.
They point out that firms with the biggest number of overseas offices may
not be the most profitable. Baker &amp; McKenzie has the highest gross revenues
of any firm in the world, but is only ranked 40th in the US when measured by
profits per partner. Opening foreign offices to practise local law is not
ruled out by firms such as Linklaters. But in general, the 'best service' to
the client can be delivered by maintaining strong relations with the best
local law firms and referring work or working with them on individual deals.
Emerging markets are best tackled by following the investment banks. James
Wyness, senior partner of Linklaters, says: 'There is no way we are going to
set up in China and practise local law, but we would follow the investment
banks to Shanghai to do Shanghai listings and international privatisations.
The same is true of eastern Europe.'
But he accepts that such a strategy is only viable for the handful of firms
in the 'magic circle' used by the investment banks. For those outside it,
the problem of how best to deliver international legal services remains.
'My advice to them would be to check what their clients want and follow
demand, but even then only take on the work if you've got the right people,'
he says.
There is a third approach to the delivery of international legal services:
the formation of law firm affiliations such as the Minneapolis-based
Commercial Law Affiliates, a non-profit making organisation with member
firms in 180 cities around the world. They see it as the best means of
servicing the international requirements of their clients. Such
associations, which monitor the standards of their members, must seem to
provide the only practicable solution to the provision of international
legal services for most medium-sized commercial law firms.
As firms jockey for position in the international legal services market,
there is one possibility which few of them like to contemplate but which
could upset even the best laid plans: a merger between a large US and large
UK firm.
The heads of the top firms on both sides of the Atlantic are adamant that
this will not happen - the cultures and remuneration of US and UK firms are
too far apart.
But there are firms whose cultures, working practices and remuneration
structures are similar - for example, Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell of New York and
Freshfields of London. A merger such as that would be 'dynamite,' says Mr
Buck.
There is also another possibility to consider: a merger between one of the
Big Six accountancy firms, a big law firm and possibly even an investment
bank. Arthur Andersen and KPMG have already signalled their intentions to
move in on legal services and must be considering how best to capitalise on
their international networks.
If such a huge multi-national multi-disciplinary partnership were to emerge,
all bets would be off as to who will dominate global legal services by the
year 2000.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (2): Firms recognise
a need to build up locally - Following a frenetic rush, lawyers are
consolidating in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Catch the last flight from London into Prague on a Sunday evening, and you
are left in little doubt that the lawyers are cashing in on one of Eastern
Europe's more lucrative markets. Cashmere coats and bulky legal document
bags are everywhere.
But after the frenetic pace at the start of the decade following the
collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989, the mood has recently begun to change -
and the seats on the aeroplanes to empty.
All across eastern and central Europe, lawyers and other financial advisers
have been taking advantage of the restructuring of the former Communist
economies. Now they are entering a different, more sober stage of
consolidation.
On paper, there are more than 30 international law firms based in the Czech
Republic alone. Similar numbers crop up in the Slovak Republic, in Poland,
Hungary, Ukraine and Russia.
But Mr Milan Ganik, partner in charge of the Prague office of Squires,
Sanders &amp; Dempsey, an Ohio, US-based firm, insists on what he calls 'the
corridor test': inspecting the firms' offices to ensure they have a physical
presence.
Many firms rely on 'fly-ins' from Western European cities and just a nominal
place on the letterhead. Squires, by contrast, is one of the larger
international firms with a local presence, with more than 50 staff including
lawyers and a large number of professional support staff such as
interpreters and legal assistants.
Like a number of the other pioneering Western firms that moved east, Squires
found that most early business from the government. Lawyers signed
agreements to act as privatisation advisers, even to the extent of
temporarily debarring them from working for potential purchasers.
That made sound commercial sense at the time. The public sector was where
most activity was taking place, it had the money to pay bills from the
proceeds of sales, and it offered the chance to make powerful contacts for
the future.
Some firms also took advantage of what one executive derisively calls
'breakfast directors' hired more for their influence and potential marketing
power than any professional or business skills. Latterly, that tactic has
proved double-edged, as some former civil servants and politicians have
moved out of favour, or become increasingly tarred by the legacy of the
past.
But most firms that take central and eastern Europe seriously recognise the
need to build up a local staff. They are now beginning to see the fruits of
their early attempts to recruit Czech staff at junior levels - with a
post-graduate legal qualification obtained elsewhere.
This is creating new tensions as some of the most highly-qualified are
poached at substantial salaries by direct competitors or by companies. Even
if they stay, it can cause friction with more senior local staff suddenly
seeing their juniors receiving expatriate-style remuneration.
Mr Ganik argues that there will always be a need for external skills.
Western clients very often still seek 'cultural comfort' by using a firm
that has some Western-trained lawyers, he says.
A more disturbing trend of late for international firms in the region has
been the backlash against advice from foreign consultants. In the Czech
republic it has been fuelled by the collapse of some recent prominent
corporate deals. Critical comments were directed at White &amp; Case, another of
the firms with a large Prague presence, which acted on the Volkswagen-Skoda
joint venture which ran into difficulties.
It has been reinforced by hostile remarks made by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
out-spoken prime minister, who has criticised foreign advisers. His views
may be strong, but they reflect far wider calls for a distinctive,
nationally-inspired approach to economic and legal reform.
These concerns are echoed by Mr Petr Sramek of the Alliance of European
Lawyers, a group of independent firms across the continent which has
supported the establishment of a stand-alone member firm in Prague.
'Foreign firms eat the best clients and distort our legal practice,' he
says. 'They overcharge, and draft or impose contracts and legal concepts
that do not work here.'
He argues that there is still a 'missionary spirit' in the attitude of many
new lawyers coming to the east from other parts of the world, and that the
enthusiasm has created a substantial overhang of supply over demand.
Flicking through a five-inch-thick bundle of job applications from western
lawyers, he says: 'We need more Czech lawyers. The future here depends on
them.'
That is not to say that he is blindly in support of everything local. He
says most politicians in the country are 'second tier', and that much
legislation passed since 1989 has been too hasty and is riddled with
loopholes.
Equally, he says the judges are no more familiar with the laws than the
lawyers, and that they are applied differently in courts around the country.
Looking forward, many lawyers in the region argue that over the next few
years there will be a period of legal consolidation, as well as introduction
of laws on new areas Daniel Arbess, managing partner for Prague for White &amp;
Case, expects his firm to gather most business now from corporate finance
and capital markets work.
'The first stage was reshuffling the ownership deck (of companies),' he
says. 'The second stage is re-dealing the cards to make them more
profitable.' He also sees a shake-out of foreign law firms as inevitable.
'This is one of the most competitive legal markets in the world,' he says.
'And firms are likely to see diminishing business as local firms grow.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Technology: Exorcising Satan Bug - A new breed of multiple
viruses is threatening PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can a computer virus change its spots? Yes, say computer security experts,
who warn that a new breed of sophisticated computer virus that changes
itself into multiple versions is becoming more common and that it can outwit
some anti-virus software.
Known as polymorphic viruses, they are designed to hide from popular
anti-virus programs by changing themselves slightly each time they
replicate.
Businesses relying on older versions of anti-virus scanning software risk
leaving their PCs open to infection from polymorphic viruses. Such viruses
can produce as many as 2.3 trillion versions of themselves, making them
impossible to detect without the help of a new generation of anti-virus
software.
'There is no question about it, polymorphic viruses are definitely the wave
of the future,' says Phil Talsky, product manager at leading US anti-virus
software developer McAfee Associates. Talsky adds that the most common
polymorphic virus is the Satan Bug and it is infecting increasing numbers of
PC users. 'It recently entered our top 10 list of most often reported
viruses, at number nine.'
David Stang, head of US-based Norman Data Defense Systems and founder of the
International Computer Security Association, agrees that the Satan Bug poses
a computer security challenge. 'We are hearing more reports daily of Satan
Bug infections and it is a major problem for some organisations.'
The Satan Bug has turned up at some US government agencies where it has
infected several hundred PC systems. These include the Social Security
Administration and the Army Corp of Engineers. There have also been reports
that the Satan Bug has been found in European PC systems, and that Tremors,
another polymorphic virus, is affecting PC users in Germany.
However, they should not panic, Stang says. 'Becoming infected by any kind
of virus is rare and coming across the Satan Bug is even rarer. But if you
are unlucky enough to get infected, it is going to be expensive.'
The Satan Bug is not designed to erase data like some viruses, such as
Michelangelo, but it interferes with users trying to connect to a local area
network and will change file dates. It replicates quickly and can travel
across a local area network to infect other users.
Computer virus experts at IBM say polymorphic viruses should not trouble
most users. 'If users take proper precautions, polymorphic viruses are easy
to deal with,' says Steve White, manager of the high integrity computing
laboratory at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. 'We have not found a
very high infection rate among users by the Satan Bug and the whole issue of
polymorphic viruses has received more attention than it deserves.'
White and his colleagues at IBM have completed several detailed studies of
how computer virus infections propagate. They were the first to label the
Michelangelo virus scare two years ago as overblown and correctly predicted
that it would not cause much damage.
White points out that PC users face about the same chance of a virus
infection as they do of a hard disc failure, so proper backup procedures
should be a routine task. To eliminate a virus, users must detect and often
erase infected files and then reinstall them from an uninfected backup disk.
This can take several hours for each PC infected. The US Army Corps of
Engineers estimates that it lost more than Dollars 12,000 per hour in trying
to exorcise the Satan Bug.
McAfee's latest version of its ViruScan software can detect Satan Bug, but
users must delete all infected files.
While Stang says he has developed an anti-virus program that can detect and
erase the Satan Bug without requiring users to reinstall infected files,
Talsky says polymorphic viruses are more difficult to guard against since
they use encryption to hide from virus scanning software. 'Polymorphic
viruses are algorithm-based so we have to essentially crack their code first
and produce algorithms to counter them. Normally, it takes our programmers
one hour to modify our software to detect a regular virus, but with a
polymorphic virus, it can take us 48 hours to develop software that can
detect it.'
Researchers at IBM say they are working on an automatic system to detect and
analyse new polymorphic viruses. This will enable a faster response in
producing updates of anti-virus software and help slow their spread.
While computer virus experts concede that polymorphic viruses are written by
very talented programmers, the developer of the Satan Bug is believed to be
a 16-year-old computer enthusiast who uses the pseudonym Hacker4Life. There
is no US law prohibiting the writing of a virus program and programmers
often post their latest virus creation quite openly on local computer
bulletin board systems. There are about 2,500 known PC viruses.
Advancing computer technology could help solve this growing problem. Western
Digital, a US company making hard discs, has developed a chip, the
Immunizer, designed to monitor system activity and to block any suspicious
writing to the hard disc. However, the chip works only with certain newer
PCs.
On the software side, companies are developing different types of anti-virus
programs that, like the Immunizer chip, monitor what is happening within the
PC. If the software detects suspicious activity, it blocks it and flags an
alert.
Talsky warns that more polymorphic viruses are coming.
While the risk from a PC virus infection is small, there are important
safeguards all PC users should adopt. These include using the latest
anti-virus software. 'We produce new versions of ViruScan every six weeks,'
says Talsky. 'But there are a lot of people using older versions and they
won't get the full protection.' Any anti-virus software version written
before August 1993 is unlikely to offer protection against polymorphic
viruses. Users should contact their vendor and update their software.
All new software, no matter what its source, must be scanned for viruses.
'Most people avoid computer bulletin boards and shareware software, thinking
that they might be infected. But most of our calls are from users that have
been infected from commercial software, especially demo software disks,'
says Talsky.
Stang recommends that users with many PCs decide on a computer security
strategy. 'Some users apply the same security to all their systems. The
problem with this approach is that some systems should be better protected
while others may not need quite so much protection. If you tell each user
that they must spend five to 10 minutes each day scanning for viruses, that
translates into a huge cost in terms of staff time over the course of a
year. That can turn out to be more expensive than dealing with a virus
infection.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Technology: Robots ration costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNA KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new robot installation for packing military rations is helping the French
army cut costs and could even earn it some money. The FFr60m (Pounds 6.8m)
facility is automated and can respond quickly to sharp increases in demand
at times of crisis.
This could make it attractive to other armies and aid organisations, says
Colonel Hugues Keller, head of the facility at Angers, south-west France.
With an output of 24 rations per minute, the plant easily satisfies the
army's regular annual requirement for 2m rations and could produce two or
three times as much.
Developed as part of the army's cost-cutting programme, the facility
concentrates the production of military rations on one site. Before, there
were two. Also, says Keller, 'we have seized the opportunity and installed
state-of-the-art technology which will satisfy the needs not only of today's
army but also that of the next century'.
The robots fill cardboard cartons with the 18 constituents of a soldier's
daily food allowance. The 14 possible menus include tinned cooked meals,
chocolate bars, chewing gum, packet soup, water purification tablets, dry
crackers and paper tissues.
Each package must be put in the right position in the box so it can be
closed, sealed and covered in plastic film, ready to be packed for shipment.
At the centre of the system is a line of nine small robots from Californian
manufacturer Adept, each responsible for loading two different components
into the cartons from a conveyor.
The larger, more robust items such as the tins are put into the ration
carton first. These are removed from their boxes and fed directly to the
Adept line, one layer at a time, by three large robots from ABB Robotique
France, part of the Swiss-Swedish group. The smaller items are then fed to
the Adept robots.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Technology: Clinton's trio of successes - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH SHAPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The administration of US president Bill Clinton had very mixed fortunes in
its first year, but its efforts to promote government science and technology
programmes were rewarded with three successes. As a result, these now have a
better chance of contributing more directly to the US economy.
One important achievement was the administration's work in the last days of
the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks to have the draft
text revised to allow government-industry research partnerships to proceed
largely free of Gatt red tape. Such partnerships are a keystone of Clinton's
technology policy, one aim of which is to develop basic research insights
into competitive new products.
The 1990 draft text made government subsidies of industry projects liable to
retaliatory action. Government subsidies to industry for basic research that
were more than 50 per cent of a project's total cost were actionable, as
were government subsidies of an industry applied research project for more
than 23 per cent of the total.
The Gatt draft text had elaborate requirements for advance notice by those
forming such partnerships. Also, other nations could seek penalties through
Gatt if they deemed a subsidy hurt their trade.
This draft Gatt text would have made it risky for government officials to
sign up industry research, as they do now on a range of scientific and
technological projects. It would, for example, have imperilled the National
Institute of Health's relationships with biotechnology companies.
Computing the government's share in such projects would have been a
nightmare. It would also have been open to dispute, and therefore to trade
retaliation, if the Gatt subsidies committee judged the calculation wrong.
The prospect of retaliation from other governments if a government-industry
partnership invented a pioneering product might even dissuade companies from
forming such partnerships.
In November, science officials confronted US trade officials in a meeting of
Clinton's new National Economic Council, and the Gatt text was changed in a
last-minute session in Brussels.
The new text exempts all government-industry partnerships formed for
undirected basic research. Partnerships for industrial research are exempt
if the government share is less than 75 per cent. A new category of
'pre-competitive development' subsidies are allowed if the government share
is 30 per cent or less.
A second success was the approval of a new National Science and Technology
Council in the White House. It will be on a par with the NEC, the National
Security Council, and the Domestic Policy Council. Like these it will be a
forum to arbitrate conflicting agency positions.
The chairman will be the president, though vice-president Al Gore may
effectively be the chairman, while the day-to-day job will probably fall to
Jack Gibbons, the president's science adviser.
The council, along with its sub-committees, is to co-ordinate the Dollars
76bn (Pounds 51bn) government research and development programme, now spread
among dozens of agencies. It will decide how to implement tasks such as
basic research, communications and health. Importantly, Clinton wants this
new council to decide - with the Office of Management and Budget - how funds
should be allocated among competing agencies.
Clinton's third achievement was to get Congress to fund his research and
technology investments during the wrestling match with Congress over the
budget for fiscal 1994. Despite the feverish budget-cutting mood of Congress
and Clinton's agreement to cap federal spending for five years, research
survived - civilian research even increased.
The president also obtained funds for the technology investments he most
wanted: the 'clean' car, the data superhighway and global climate research.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Parts makers set for VW boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Component purchases in the UK by the Volkswagen group could rise to Pounds
400m this year, double the level of two years ago, UK-based executives of
the German carmaker indicated yesterday.
The estimate follows a visit by Dr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the
Volkswagen group's purchasing director. He arrived in the UK last week to
offer 360 senior executives of the UK's motor components industry the
prospect of substantially more business with VW.
Dr Lopez, the former General Motors purchasing director still embroiled in
industrial espionage allegations, told a meeting of components companies'
executives that he was hoping for a tenfold increase in quotations from
potential UK suppliers.
Volkswagen, engaged in a struggle to cut component costs and improve
productivity in Germany, has embarked on what Dr Lopez describes as a
'global sourcing policy' in pursuit of high-quality, low-cost parts.
Supplies from the UK have become an increasingly attractive prospect for
Volkswagen.
This is partly because of cost-competitiveness helped by sterling's
devaluation against the D-mark.
However, the components industry is also judged to have benefited
substantially in quality terms from its links with Japanese 'transplant'
factories in the UK.
These encouraged Volkswagen last year to set up a separate components
purchasing department at its Milton Keynes headquarters. This now employs
nearly 20 people and last year purchases rose to Pounds 300m.
Dr Lopez said VW had installed a computerised response mechanism, ensuring a
response within two weeks to all component quotations. VW is also making
available teams of its own engineers to suppliers needing to improve design
or other efficiencies. One such team has been active in the UK since
October.
Germany's other two indigenous car makers, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have also
been increasing their components purchases from UK suppliers, although from
a smaller base than VW.

Separate surveys published yesterday by housebuilders and estate agents
emphasised the continuing recovery in the housing market.
A Housebuilders Federation survey said 76 per cent of builders expected to
increase house sales this year. Another quarter expected house prices to
rise by 5-10 per cent while 57 per cent expected prices to rise by 1-5 per
cent.
A survey by the Board of the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents,
representing 4,200 estate agents handling about half of all UK house sales,
reported that net sales rose by 12.6 per cent last year while contract
exchanges rose by 10.1 per cent.

A woman turned down for a job after having her CV posted back to her with
the words 'four-year-old son' written across it won Pounds 760 compensation
at an industrial tribunal in Southampton yesterday.
The tribunal ruled that Miss Julie Crosbie, 26, a secretary, was sexually
discriminated against by the Wilky Group, a construction and civil
engineering concern, when she was interviewed for a secretarial post last
year.
At the interview Mr Adrian Smith, a divisional director of the company, was

A Confederation of British Industry survey yesterday painted a more
optimistic picture of business trends than last week's report from the
British Chambers of Commerce.
The CBI was unabashed by the discrepancy. It pointed out that most of its
replies were received after the start of January; the British Chambers of
Commerce survey was carried out between November 26 and December 17. The CBI
also said its report covered larger companies and included a wider range of
questions.
This does not account for all the discrepancies. Smaller companies, tied to
the fortunes of the domestic economy, seem to be performing better than
larger ones. This should have made the Chambers of Commerce survey, focused
on smaller companies, more optimistic than the CBI report.
An encouraging sign in the CBI survey is that orders and output are
increasing faster than forecast in the last report in October. Total new
orders grew at the strongest rate since January 1989, with a balance of plus
11 per cent experiencing an increase. That compares with just plus 5 per
cent expecting an increase in October. The trend also appears to be
strengthening, with plus 22 per cent - the highest figure since October 1988
 -expecting order growth to continue over the next four months.
The pound's recent strength does not appear to have had a substantial impact
on export orders. The balance of those experiencing an increase was plus 8
per cent while plus 18 per cent expect a rise over the next four months.
However, the percentage of those naming prices as the main constraint on
export demand rose to 56 per cent, from 52 per cent in October.
A balance of plus 9 per cent saw growth in manufacturing output over the
last four months, a slightly higher figure than in October. The CBI
forecasts that output will grow by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of
1994, based on its survey figure showing a balance of plus 16 per cent
expecting an increase. Furthermore, the balance of companies intending to
increase spending on plant and machinery over the coming year was positive
for the first time since July 1989. More companies have cut domestic prices
than raised them over the last four months, and the same trend is true in
export prices. There is a strong balance of plus 12 per cent in favour of
increasing prices over the next four months.
Price pressures are being eased by companies' tight control on costs. Unit
costs fell faster than at any time since 1958, when the survey was first
conducted, with 12 per cent more companies reporting a fall in costs over
the past four months than an increase, and 5 per cent more expecting costs
to decline than to go up.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Seeing the future in the Mirror: The Independent's survival
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the mist surrounding the negotiations on the future of The
Independent was blown away yesterday to reveal a smile on the face of Mr
Andreas Whittam Smith, the paper's main founder.
Mr Whittam Smith has successfully put together a consortium linking the
founders, the main existing shareholders - El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica
of Italy - and Mirror Group Newspapers to bid jointly for the 52.92 per cent
of the shares not already held by the consortium members.
If the bid is successful - and so far no price has been agreed nor formal
bid submitted - MGN would take a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing,
publisher of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. It would also
see Mr Whittam Smith becoming chairman of the company as well as
editor-in-chief.
'El Pas and La Repubblica asked me to be chairman; I would not have
suggested it myself,' said Mr Whittam Smith. He said he was convinced the
titles' independence had been protected.
'I think it is just the right balance, having partners but not being
smothered,' he said, arguing that MGN's 40 per cent would not amount to
financial control of the equity. MGN has also given undertakings that it
will not vote on the removal or appointment of editors.
The consortium proposal, which would give El Pas and La Repubblica together
just over 50 per cent of the equity, means that if Mr Tony O'Reilly,
chairman of Independent Newspapers in Ireland, pursues his interests he will
almost certainly have to submit a full bid for the company.
Mr Whittam Smith was yesterday emphasising the cost savings involved in
joining with a larger newspaper group. There will be separate editorial and
a separate 'marketing brain' to develop the Independent brands, but
virtually everything else will be shared.
Mr David Montgomery, MGN chief executive, emphasised yesterday: 'We are not
in the business of putting talented people on the streets.'
A slimmed down staff and joint operations in the 'back office' would remove,
it was suggested yesterday, the need for a high-profile chief executive at
Newspaper Publishing such as Mr Patrick Morrissey who now holds the
position.
As printing contracts come up for renewal, MGN will print The Independent at
its plants in Watford and Oldham and its new plant in Glasgow.
Under the plan, the Independent's staff would join MGN and the Telegraph
group in the Canary Wharf complex in London's Docklands, creating the
outlines of an informal grouping against Mr Rupert Murdoch's concentration
of five national newspapers in nearby Wapping.
'We are in the front line of trying to develop the collegiate system of
producing newspapers,' Mr Montgomery said yesterday. Such a collegiate
system would involve rival newspaper groups sharing as many services as
possible to save costs, while continuing to compete on areas such as
editorial and advertising.
For MGN the Independent investment would be 'a long and tough process'. But
it would take the popular newspaper group into a new sector of the market
with the hope of 'producing more titles from the same resources'.
In a sideswipe at Mr O'Reilly, the MGN chief executive suggested that
without such economies of scale The Independent refinancing 'would not be a
proposition'.
But Mr Whittam Smith is not home and dry yet. One Newspaper Publishing
adviser yesterday referred scathingly to 'an unpriced non-bid after five
weeks'. Pressure will now be applied to the consortium to come up with the
money as soon as possible so that the end game can begin.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Builders' outlook most upbeat since 1989
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more encouraging news for the government on the economy yesterday,
as the building industry published its most optimistic survey on work
prospects for four years.
The Building Employers Confederation said contractors during the final three
months of last year had enjoyed the biggest rise in inquiries from potential
customers since the beginning of 1989.
Sir Brian Hill, confederation president, said: 'If the construction industry
is a barometer for the rest of the economy, the underlying trend is
encouraging.'
According to the survey, contractors were 'more optimistic about output over
the next 12 months than at any time since the end of 1989'.
Thirty-one per cent of the 600 companies questioned expected to increase
output over the next 12 months. This compared with 47 per cent which
expected output to remain unchanged, and only 21 per cent which expected
workloads to fall further.
A further 38 per cent reported that inquiries from customers had risen
compared with the previous three months while 42 per cent said there had
been no change. Only 20 per cent reported a fall in inquiries.
Sir Brian said: 'Clearly output has now stabilised after its long decline.
It must be emphasised, however, that any growth in 1994 is expected to be
modest.
'Some contractors were still charging suicidal prices in the chase to win
work, and one-fifth of companies expected to reduce their workforces further
during the next 12 months.'
Sir Brian said that output was expected to rise by 'no more than 2 per cent
this year', adding that the industry had already lost 500,000 jobs since it
employed 1.8m at the height of the construction boom in June 1989.
He was also concerned that tax rises in April might undermine recovery in
the housing market. He appealed to the government to consider a further cut
in interest rates.
The confederation said inquiries from customers had risen in every area
except public housing and private industrial work.
It said environment department figures showed that the value of orders won
by contractors had risen by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 16.31bn in the first 10
months of last year. Since then most of the contracts had been awarded for
London's Jubilee line underground extension.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Tribunal awards mother Pounds 760
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A woman turned down for a job after having her CV posted back to her with
the words 'four-year-old son' written across it won Pounds 760 compensation
at an industrial tribunal in Southampton yesterday.
The tribunal ruled that Miss Julie Crosbie, 26, a secretary, was sexually
discriminated against by the Wilky Group, a construction and civil
engineering concern, when she went for a job interview last year.
At the interview Mr Adrian Smith, a divisional director of the company, was
said to have formed a 'stereotype view' of the unmarried mother and
muttered: 'This may have a bearing on your application,' when she first told
him about her son.
Miss Crosbie, of Farnborough, Hants, was interviewed for a secretarial post
at the Wilky Group headquarters in Farnborough but she said the interview
took a downward trend when she said she had a young child.
Mr Smith denied asking her if she had children. He said: 'I asked her if she
could work late. It was then that she said she could but that she would have
to check each time to make sure her son could be sufficiently looked after.
'It made no difference to her application as long as she could assure me it
would not impinge on her ability to do the job.'
He insisted he was unable to build up 'any rapport' with an 'aggressive'
Miss Crosbie during the interview and instead offered it to one of the other
11 candidates.
He said the woman who eventually took the job was also a mother.
The tribunal said it accepted Miss Crosbie's version of events and awarded
her the money for 'hurt feelings'. The amount was limited as the tribunal
decided 'that on the balance of probability' she would not have have been
successful in getting the job.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Pit closures could continue after sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal intends to complete most of its pre-privatisation pit closures
programme by March, leaving determination of the final size of the industry
to its successors.
That means the operators of the privatised industry might face politically
sensitive decisions on whether to close mines almost as soon as they have
bought them.
British Coal is expected to be in private hands by the spring, or next year
at the latest. But corporation executives and the government are working to
go ahead with almost all pre-privatisation closures by the end of the
financial year in two months.
They are likely to be cautious, leaving more pits open than the market can
sustain in the long term. Between five and eight of the 22 operating pits
face closure, leaving about 15.
All 22 pits will be offered to the private sector. But together with
opencast operations, the 15 or so will form the core of the five packages
the government will offer for sale.
Although the government has promised to be flexible in the negotiations, it
will be reluctant to close any of the pits operating after March.
Political considerations provide one explanation for the government's
approach. Although pit closures are less controversial than they were a year
or so ago, ministers are anxious lest they reappear as an issue while the
industry is still in state hands.
In addition, the government believes the new owners will be best placed to
decide on the number of deep mines they need once they take them over and
start running them.
The exact number of deep mines that will survive much beyond privatisation
will depend on how much more productivity the new owners can squeeze out of
miners, on how quickly they run down coal stocks and on how much opencast
mining they carry out.
It seems unlikely, however, that there will be much room in the market for
more than about a dozen of the 15 or so in the core packages.
NM Rothschild, merchant bankers advising the government on coal
privatisation, forecast two years ago that there was a future, after the
sell-off, for 14 pits.
Since then, however, the prospects for coal have diminished considerably as
a result of a marked improvement in performance by nuclear power plants and
a faster move than expected by generating companies into gas-fired
generation.
In addition, the 15 or so pits that will be offered for sale in the five
packages will face competition. That is because several pits closed by
British Coal in the past year are likely to be mined under licence by
private operators.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday published consultation documents on
the proposed licensing regime for the privatised coal industry.
He published a an explanatory note describing how the Coal Authority, which
will license mining, is to carry out its functions. The note also sets draft
model licensing documents.
British Coal Enterprises, the job creation agency established 10 years ago
to bring employment opportunities into coalfield areas, announced yesterday
it had placed 100,000 people in work.

FT  25 JAN 94 / A quest for the acceptable face of intervention: Andrew
Adonis weighs up the competitive edge of Michael Heseltine's aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine's announcement of a forthcoming government white paper
on competitiveness heralds no dramatic policy shift. Instead, it looks set
to bring together recent public and private-sector initiatives, add a few
more, and release the package with the kind of bang that no-one in the
government but the trade and industry secretary seems able to create.
The new policy tone came nearly two years ago, when Mr Heseltine succeeded
Mr Peter Lilley at the Department of Trade and Industry. In practice, Mr
Heseltine is no more interventionist than his predecessor, but he is keener
to admit how much intervention takes place - and determined to focus state
resources on addressing weaknesses.
As he put it to a Commons committee last week: 'I have been a minister since
1970 . . . and I must tell you that all governments intervene all the time;
the only question is what form it takes.'
The backdrop to the white paper is deepening concern at the capacity even of
top-notch UK companies to compete, particularly against rising industries in
Asia.
A report last year by IBM Consulting Group, part of the US computing giant,
claimed from a study of 202 UK manufacturing sites that only 2 per cent were
world-class, although three-quarters believed they could match the best
international standards.
As a first step, Mr Heseltine has given improved export promotion a high
priority. He is 'signing up' ambassadors to a new approach. Where more than
one UK company is bidding for a state contract abroad, the government will
generally put its lobbying weight behind just one bid 'whereas before it
often just stood aside'.
Mr Heseltine is even expecting ambassadors and their staff to be available
for video-conference briefings with people gathered in new 'Business Links'
being established across the country. Electronics components producers in
Swindon should be able to ask, say, the British consul in Chicago about
developments in the US mid west's vehicle industry.
Spreading best practice is another key theme. Two months ago the
Confederation of British Industry launched a 'competitiveness forum' geared
to highlighting excellence in manufacturing industry and spreading the word.
Twenty companies have been designated so far; briefings by senior executives
and one-day 'best practice focus sessions' are being organised with the host
company vetting the guest list to avoid commercial sensitivities.
US practice is a strong influence, with its 'competitiveness councils' and
annual bench-marking.
So far, however, Mr Heseltine's initiatives have been more limited. To date
he has:
Split up the DTI's trade and exports division, with 80 named officials
responsible for each export market under a director-general of export
promotion.
Set up a competitiveness unit headed by Mr Bob Dobbie, which is working with
trade associations to 'benchmark' industrial sectors against their
counterparts abroad. The results, unpublished, are said to make depressing
reading.
Established 'Business Links' as local outlets for DTI services currently
handled by its nine regional offices, also tapping the resources of local
Chambers of Commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils. As yet only four
have been set up, the largest of which is in Birmingham. But the target is
200 within two years.
But how much conviction is there that the new structures will make a
difference? At last week's Commons trade and industry committee meeting, Mr
Heseltine was asked, from his experience as an entrepreneur in the 1960s,
what the government could have done to help him. 'Abolish the DTI,' came the
reply.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Wind farms may be sold off: Taylor Woodrow's participation
in the sector's biggest operator is under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's windpower industry may face a significant setback as Taylor
Woodrow, one of the most important industrial players in the market,
considers its involvement in the sector. The construction company is
understood to be reviewing the future of its wholly owned Wind Energy Group
subsidiary (WEG). A sale of the business is thought the most likely outcome.
WEG owns a third of National Wind Power, the biggest operator of wind farms
in the UK, which runs three of the nation's 19 wind farms. National Power,
the UK's largest electricity generator, owns the other two-thirds of the
company.
British Aerospace, which previously owned WEG jointly with Taylor Woodrow,
pulled out last year.
A similar decision by Taylor Woodrow would raise questions about the
finances of wind power when it also faces growing opposition from some
environmentalists and planning authorities. They have complained of noise
and unsightliness.
National Wind Power owns wind farms at Cemmaes in Powys, Llangwyryfon in
Dyfed and Cold Northcott in Cornwall producing a combined 21MW. It operates
a fourth for Yorkshire Water at Chelker in North Yorkshire.
The three National Wind Power farms were shut down temporarily before
Christmas during high winds which damaged three of the 66 turbines.
The company expects to start operating some of the turbines this week and
all of them by the end of April. The problems, however, may have delayed a
decision by Taylor Woodrow to seek a buyer for its interest.
The construction group, after incurring a Pounds 66.1m pre-tax loss in 1992,
made a Pounds 10.1m pre-tax profit in the first half of the current year. It
has told shareholders it intends to free itself from peripheral activities
in order to concentrate on its core businesses of construction,
housebuilding and commercial property and merchanting.
As part of this review Taylor Woodrow has been considering the future of its
windfarm business - which remained profitable until the shutdown.
WEG, formed with British Aerospace in 1978, offers design and supply of
equipment as well as operation of windfarms.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Hurd warns Foreign Office staff on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, yesterday met about 600 members of the
Foreign Office's London-based staff to spell out the difficult challenges
facing the Diplomatic Service.
The one-hour 'full house' meeting, called by the staff unions, elicited
little enthusiasm from most staff - particularly the junior officers, whose
expectations of assurances on pay and working hours remained largely
un-satisfied.
'It was entirely predictable,' one staff representative said. 'Mr Hurd was
his usual consummate diplomatic self, but managed to avoid answering many of
the practical questions put to him in writing.' The foreign secretary began
his presentation by emphasising the satisfaction that could be gained by
working for the Diplomatic Service, still one of the most desirable jobs in
the public sector.
He also assured staff that the government intended the Diplomatic Service to
remain a 'core' public service.
However, he stressed that it would be spread much more thinly because of
financial constraints, and gave little hope to its junior members, who claim
to be badly underpaid.
He was no more encouraging in response to complaints that some officials,
particularly in senior grades, were obliged to work unreasonably long hours
without adequate financial reward. Mr Hurd 'fully supported' a cut in long
hours. But he said it should be achieved through a reduction in paper flow
rather than through a specific allowance.
Grades of first secretary and above would not be paid overtime. They could,
after all, expect greater compensations in their subsequent careers.
In particular, he warned staff they would have to live with money-saving
schemes, such as the market-testing programme, affecting some Foreign Office
services which had been opened to outside bidders.
Mr Hurd said the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, could not carry out his
anti-inflation or budgetary policies without keeping a sharp eye on public
expenditure including money allotted to the Foreign Office.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Total of Lloyd's agents heavily cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of members' agents at Lloyd's of London has fallen by nearly a
third over the past 12 months, signalling continued rationalisation among
businesses trading on the insurance market.
Only 46 members' agents - which handle the affairs of the individual Names
whose assets have traditionally supported the market - will trade in 1994
compared with 65 in 1993 according to figures from Indemnity Insurance
Services (IIS), an insurance broker and Lloyd's advisory company.
Ten years ago more than 250 agencies handled the affairs of Names but the
number has fallen sharply following losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the
past five years.
Lloyd's is pressing agents to transfer many of the their functions - such as
holding Names' deposits - to a new central services unit run by the Lloyd's
Corporation, which administers and regulates the market. The initiative is
part of a move to improve the market's overall efficiency.
Members' agents are also under intense legal pressures. Lossmaking Names
have alleged that the advice provided by many in the 1980s was poor, and
have targeted agents in more than a dozen separate legal actions.
Already the financial resources of many agents have been stretched by the
cost of contributing some Pounds 50m to a Pounds 900m proposal that Lloyd's
has offered lossmakers in an attempt to settle disputes outside the courts.
The agents named in the legal actions have net assets (aside from insurance
cover) of no more than Pounds 80m according to the document that details the
terms of the offer.
Legal action became more likely last week when two large groups of
lossmaking Names voted against accepting the deal, making it unlikely that
Lloyd's will be able to secure its 70 per cent majority - by value of the
offer - necessary for the deal to go ahead.
A meeting of the Devonshire Names Action group last night overwhelmingly
opposed an offer of Pounds 45m compensation, and said legal proceedings
would start once the February 14 deadline for accepting the offer had
passed.
Meanwhile, IIS claims that the number of Lloyd's syndicates will decline in
1994, with 53 of the 228 syndicates active last year either merging or
closing. Four new syndicates will start underwriting in 1994.
In spite of the decline in numbers, both individual agents and syndicates
will be bigger. Lloyd's ability to accept insurance premiums will rise from
Pounds 8.7bn in 1993 to at least Pounds 10.5bn in 1994 following the
attraction of new corporate capital to the market.

The Department of Trade and Industry has told life companies to make the
best estimate they can of their exposure resulting from mis-selling of
personal pensions to individuals leaving occupational pension schemes.
Debate has focused on concern about mis-selling to people transferring out
of schemes where they had already left the company. However, the DTI wants
also to be certain about life insurers' exposure on sales of private
pensions to people who opted out of schemes where they were still employed.
It has asked the companies to deliver their estimates by the end of the
month.
Although the number of 'opt-outs' is much smaller than the estimated 500,000
pension transfers, in cases where there is a need for compensation,
individual payments are likely to be much higher.
The DTI inquiry is directed at establishing whether the exposure of any life
company threatens its solvency.
The department has advised life companies that where they are likely to have
a liability, this should be recognised either in the mathematical reserves
or in the provisions made in the accounts. Different methods will be
appropriate for different types of company and the business they write.
Companies must file returns within six months of the year-end to the DTI.
Where a specific provision for mis-selling does not appear in a life
office's returns to the DTI or in its accounts the company must provide it
separately to the department.
Both the DTI and the life industry recognise that this first estimate is
bound to contain several uncertainties.
TSB earlier this month made what it called 'prudent' provisions - estimated
to be no more than Pounds 10m - for possible compensation payments to its
55,000 pension transfer customers.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Paisley scorns declaration as 'pay-off' to IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Downing Street declaration is a down-payment to the IRA and a negotiated
surrender of Northern Ireland's constitutional link with the UK, the Rev Ian
Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said last night.
He told an audience of Conservative MPs that the document was designed to
give the terrorists a say in shaping the province's political future.
Arguing that the declaration would also strengthen the Irish government's
role in Ulster's affairs, Mr Paisley said Dublin now had the right to decide
'the sort of institutions and structures to be set up in Northern Ireland.
'Cross-border bodies with a permanent unionist minority and, as proposed by
Dublin, with executive functions, are the next stage on the surrender road,'
he said.
The DUP leader's words came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, called
on Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, to lift the ban on his entry to the
US. Insisting that Sinn Fein was not engaged in armed struggle, Mr Adams
said US authorities could help the Northern Ireland peace process by
allowing him in to the US. The Sinn Fein president has been invited, along
with other leading Ulster politicians, to address the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy in New York next week.
Mr Adams recently failed in his appeal against an exclusion order keeping
him out of mainland Britain.
Meanwhile, the political talks process involving the province's
constitutional parties continued in Belfast yesterday afternoon with a
meeting between Mr Michael Ancram, a junior Northern Ireland minister, and
the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party's four Westminster
MPs.
The Northern Ireland Office said the two sides agreed on the need for
further early progress in the talks 'across all three strands'. They plan to
meet again soon.
An unexploded letter bomb was found last night at a girls' school run by
nuns in the Irish Republic border town of Dundalk. Police believe it had
been sent by an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Pensions code sought by funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should consider implementing regulatory reform of pension
schemes through codes of practice rather than legislation, the National
Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, said
yesterday.
The Department of Social Security has invited comment on proposals to reform
the regulatory regime for occupational pensions prepared by its Pensions Law
Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode.
The association said legislation could be years away, while many elements of
the proposals could be in place by the autumn if there were a code of
conduct.
Mr David Morgan, chairman of the association's parliamentary committee,
said: 'In endorsing this robust new system and supporting most of the Goode
recommendations, we are concerned that uncertainty over the two years until
any new legislation could come into effect would make it difficult to plan
with confidence.'
The association conceded that codes of conduct were not legally enforceable,
but 'the Inland Revenue has worked with codes of conduct for years and try
breaking one of those'. It said that failure to comply with voluntary codes
of conduct should cost schemes their tax-exemption rights.
The association recognises that at least some of the elements of the Goode
Committee recommendations, such as the creation of a new pensions regulator,
will require primary legislation.
In its response to the report, the association urged changes in the most
crucial element of proposals for pension fund reform - the requirement that
all schemes meet a so-called minimum solvency requirement ensuring that they
could meet 90 per cent of all liabilities if they were suddenly wound up.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Cheerful Tories do their sums: The tide may be turning
against Labour in Birmingham for local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham Conservatives look remarkably cheerful. Not for them the
discomfort of rhetorical twists on 'back to basics', paternal confessions
about love children, Iraq amnesia and allegations of gerrymandering. They
scent power.
The campaign for May's local elections in the UK's largest metropolitan
authority has already started. Mathematically, the Conservative position is
promising. The party needs a gain of four seats to break Labour control, a
gain of 10 to become the largest party on the city council and a gain of 16
to win overall control.
The party hopes for an election decided on local issues. One of the three
main priorities on the Conservative local election platform is what Mr
Bernard Zissman, the Tory leader, calls 'waste in the Birmingham council'.
Certainly Mrs Theresa Stewart, who came to the Labour leadership from the
left of the party, has had three difficult months. There have been rows, and
some have been serious, such as those about spending priorities and whether
more should be spent on education and less on prestige civil projects such
as the International Convention Centre. Some have been trivial, attracting
ridicule: for example, the accusation that the council tried to ban
Christmas by having Christmas lights without Christian symbols.
Labour tightened its grip on the council in 1990, but lost ground at the
last local election. At the 1992 elections, the Conservatives won 11 seats,
taking their total to 43. Labour was left with 61 and the Liberal Democrats
13, with one held by an independent.
This shifting political balance is not unknown in the city. 'Birmingham is
untypical in that, historically, there is an even balance between the
parties,' said Dr Carl Chinn, Birmingham University's community historian.
Labour has had a majority since 1984. Dr Chinn said: 'Labour has been in
control longer this time than the normal cycle of six to eight years. It
takes three or four years to build up the vote and then three or four years
to lose it again.'
So there are two contradictory trends. The cyclical trend favours the
Tories. However, disillusion with central government favours Labour on the
assumption that there is no surge of popularity for Mr John Major's
government over the next four months.
Mrs Stewart, who has been Labour leader of the council since last autumn,
relates control in Birmingham to control of the national government. 'The
real pattern in Birmingham is a vote against the government. The only break
was 1982 after the Falklands war.'
She dismissed Labour losses in 1992 because they happened just after the
general election. 'People were carried along on that tide, Labour people
were despondent,' she said. In fact, the Tories won local government seats
although they lost three parliamentary constituencies in the city.
Mr Zissman sees it differently. 'This is a very parochial city,' he said.
'People are interested in what's happening. Even if you think the
Conservative government is lacking in popularity, the Labour council is no
more popular.'
Once the question of management is stripped out, there are similarities
between the Conservative and Labour approaches to future policy. Both put
education as their top priority. The Conservatives have put forward a plan
to offer free development land to companies willing to undertake the
refurbishment or new construction of schools. Mrs Stewart said: 'My top
priority is to get more money into the schools, trying to do it within the
budget process.'
After that, Mrs Stewart puts priority on social services and housing, and Mr
Zissman on law and order. Now that big spending projects for the city
centre, with the building of the International Convention Centre and the
amelioration of the traffic system, have been either completed or are under
way, the parties' attention is directed to the suburbs - where the votes
are.
But the burning local issue is one which the political parties can do very
little about: the shutting of old hospitals and the plans for new medical
complexes. Conservative and Labour alike oppose the plans. Dr Chinn
remarked: 'Any party which came out in favour would be massacred.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Banham changes Ridings' boundary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shift in the boundary between the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire is
the only change in plans from Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission
for Lincolnshire, Humberside and North Yorkshire compared with its
provisional findings for the area last June.
Lincolnshire will remain the same while the other two counties each see the
removal of one 'tier' of government, and the amalgamation of several
existing authorities.
The change shifts Selby District Council, and the portion of Boothferry
District Council which includes Goole, from the East Riding to the West
Riding. The new creation is closer to the old boundaries of the West Riding,
according to Sir John, but produces a disparate collection of communities
spreading from the banks of the River Humber to the border with Lancashire.
York is to be turned into 'greater York' in a move welcomed by the local
Confederation of British Industry. Surrounding district councils attacked
the plan, and said it did not have popular support.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Funds urge code instead of laws

The government should consider implementing regulatory reform of pension

Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, said
yesterday.
The Department of Social Security has invited comment on proposals to reform
the regulatory regime for occupational pensions prepared by its Pensions Law
Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode.
The association said legislation could be years away, while many elements of
the proposals could be in place by the autumn if a code of conduct were to

with confidence.'
The association conceded that codes of conduct were not legally enforceable,
but 'the Inland Revenue has worked with codes of conduct for years and try

voluntary codes of conduct should cost schemes their tax-exemption rights.
The association recognises that at least some of the elements of the Goode
Committee recommendations, such as the creation of a new pensions regulator,
will require primary legislation.
In its response to the report, the association urged changes in the most
crucial element of proposals for pension fund reform - the requirement that
all schemes meet a so-called minimum solvency requirement ensuring that they
could meet 90 per cent of all liabilities if they were suddenly wound up.
The Goode Committee proposed that schemes be required to add assets
immediately if its assets fell below that level.
The association, in its paper, said that the proposal could force employers
to add cash when they are least able, thus forcing them to reduce the value
of guaranteed benefits offered by the scheme or to abandon defined benefit
schemes in favour of defined contribution schemes.
'In a prolonged bear market, a sound but less than fully funded defined
benefit scheme will be a better method of pension provision for its members
than a defined contribution scheme,' the association said.
Currently, calculations of solvency at wind-up are based on whether a
pension scheme has sufficient assets to purchase fixed-interest annuities
for all members. But as interest rates fall, annuities become far more
expensive and a scheme that is solvent during a period of high interest
rates may be technically insolvent at wind-up if rates fall.
However, the association is also urging the government to go further than
the Goode Committee recommendations on funding by requiring each scheme to
set a compulsory long-term funding plan. Once agreed, the plan should be
binding on the employer and disclosed to members.

FT  25 JAN 94 / DTI seeks extent of pension exposure

The community charge grant scheme will be extended into 1995-96, Mr David

local authorities' loss of income following the Pounds 140 general reduction

Mr Curry said extension of the scheme would enable local authorities to

Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, yesterday ruled that
Langbaurgh-on-Tees Borough Council, Cleveland, acted anti-competitively when
it refused to disclose details of its workforce's pay and conditions to a
private company bidding for a contract.
The council believed the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees)
regulations (Tupe) covered the contract, which meant the bidder would be
obliged to accept the workforce on existing terms and conditions. But it
refused to say what these were because its own workforce was bidding for the
contract. It will now have to offer the contract again.

Staff at Girobank, a subsidiary of Alliance and Leicester building society,
have voted to strike and take other forms of industrial action in protest at
a 1.5 per cent basic pay offer plus Pounds 300 lump-sum bonus payments.
The executive of the National Communications Union is expected to notify the
bank that its 3,300 staff will begin an overtime ban from midnight on
Wednesday next week. Other disruption is likely to follow unless the bank
improves its offer. In the postal ballot 1,317 bank staff supported strike
action with 933 against.
The result was more overwhelming when staff were asked whether they were

FT  25 JAN 94 / Employers' worries 'hamper NVQs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over both the costs and the content of the new competence-based
National Vocational Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications
remain reasons for the failure of employers to introduce them into the
workplace, according to a survey published today.
NVQs and SVQs are intended by the government to be a main plank of its
strategy to improve vocational training. But academics have criticised NVQs
because the qualifications are based on what people can do, with little
examination of what is known or understood about a subject.
The survey, carried out by the Institute of Management Studies for the
Department of Employment, was the first big assessment of NVQs and SVQs. It
estimated that, for the UK as a whole, about 5 per cent of companies were
using NVQs and SVQs.
The survey found that large companies made greater use of the qualifications
than small companies. The institute added: 'While the majority of employers
in the survey had heard of NVQs/SVQs, only a relatively small number had
started using them.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / MPs sharply criticise second Welsh agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conduct of another Welsh development agency was sharply criticised by
members of the Commons public accounts committee last night. The MPs also
questioned the effectiveness of the Welsh Office in scrutinising the
Development Board for Rural Wales and for the lack of disciplinary
sanctions.
The attack followed the committee's scathing report last year on some
activities of the Welsh Development Agency.
The committee yesterday questioned Mr Michael Flanagan, the agency's chief
executive, and Mr Michael Scholar, the Welsh Office permanent secretary,
after a report by the National Audit Office criticised the agency's housing
allocation policy and a car leasing scheme. This report followed a finding
by the ombudsman for local administration that there had been gross
maladministration.
The agency allocated houses under a published set of rules but also under
another, unpublished set. The housing officer was involved in allocating a
house to himself and to his former wife. Under a car leasing scheme, there
was irregular expenditure of Pounds 27,000 in 1991-92.
Mr Robert Sheldon MP, the committee chairman and Labour MP for
Ashton-under-Lyne, referred to it as a 'sad story', and Mr Michael Shersby,
Tory MP for Uxbridge, said it was 'a disgraceful state of affairs'.
Mr Scholar and Mr Flanagan acknowledged that it had been unlawful to
allocate houses under unpublished rules.
Several MPs commented on the lack of sanctions taken against the agency by
the Welsh Office. Mr Scholar said that Mr Flanagan had been rebuked and the
housing officer admonished but no other disciplinary action had been taken
yet.
Asked what action had been taken by the Welsh Office in the light of the
criticism of the Welsh Development Agency, Mr Scholar said a compliance
review of all the Welsh non-departmental public bodies had been set in
train, and also an efficiency scrutiny of the Welsh Office's sponsorship of
these agencies.

FT  25 JAN 94 / November deadline set for opening milk market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milk Marketing Board has set November 1 as its new target for opening
the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to competition.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, said he hoped significant concessions made
by the board in its plans to become Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers'
co-operative would prove acceptable to Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture
minister, and the dairy trade.
Government and European Commission objections to some aspects of the plans -
on the grounds that they could undermine competition - forced the board to
abandon its original date of April 1 for freeing the market. The ministry
said talks to resolve the problems were not concluded yesterday, as had been
hoped, but that 'considerable progress' had been made and they should be
wound up shortly.
The board, which has acted as sole buyer of milk from farmers for the past
60 years, told government officials it would separate two of its main
assets.
Mr Dare said that Genus, the cattle breeding service which has a book value
of Pounds 20m, would become an unquoted company. Its shares would be
distributed to the country's 28,500 dairy farmers according to how much milk
they produce.
The board has also agreed that National Milk Records, which holds data on
the quality and quantity of milk produced by individual cows and is valued
at about Pounds 3m, will initially be turned over to the residuary body that
will wind up the board's affairs, provided that farmers are adequately
represented on the body.
Mr Dare said the records might eventually be linked up with the
independently run Animal Data Centre.
The board hopes to persuade the Dairy Trade Federation to accept the
concessions it has made on Milk Marque's system for selling milk to dairy
companies. It has agreed to allow an independent arbitrator to check that
Milk Marque applies its selling rules 'fairly and evenly' to all buyers
during its first two years, and has offered to fund this service jointly
with dairy companies.
The board aims to submit its revised plan to the government early next
month. If it wins government approval, the plan is to float Dairy Crest, the
milk processing subsidiary, in July.
The sale has to precede abolition of the board because it will provide
working capital for the new co-operative.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Tunnel route fails to end doubts: Decisions are awaited on
sections in north and mid Kent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The route for the Channel tunnel rail link announced by Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, will bring relief to hundreds of residents in London
and Kent but continuing uncertainty on two stretches of the line.
A two-mile extension of tunnelling in Islington, north London, will be
welcome on the most densely populated part of the route. The tunnel, which
starts at Barking in east London, will now extend to just east of the
Caledonian Road in Islington. Previously it was to have ended in Dalston.
Two Kent villages - Hollingbourne and Sandway - will also be spared the
worst effects by short tunnels.
But residents of Ashford and the surrounding villages face continued
uncertainty while the government decides whether to stick by its chosen
route, involving some tunnelling, to the north of the Kent town. The
alternative is to take the line above ground through the town centre,
linking directly with the new international station now being built.
But this route would adversely affect villages to the north-west where the
line rejoins the confirmed route. Mrs Rita Boyle of a local action group
said: 'This would require a completely new route through eight miles of
unspoiled countryside.'
Residents of Pepper Hill, on the edge of Northfleet in Kent, also face
continued uncertainty. The tentative plan takes the line in a shallow tunnel
under their homes, raising fears of vibration.
Three sites are still in the running for intermediate stations, although a
fourth, at Nashenden, has been dropped. The choice will be between Ebbsfleet
and Rainham, which are both near the M25 motorway, although on opposite
sides of the Thames, and Stratford, which would link in to local Underground
and British Rail routes.
A call from Kent County Council for a longer tunnel at Blue Bell Hill, where
the line passes under the North Downs, has not been accepted. Additional
tunnelling would have added to the cost of the project. As it is, the
planned extra tunnels will add Pounds 26m to the costs.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Howard ready to retreat over police structure bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is preparing a tactical retreat on
one of the most important elements of legislation to overhaul the structure
of the police in the hope of defusing opposition in the Lords.
Whitehall officials believe that Mr Howard is ready to bow to demands from
opponents of the bill that the government drop its proposal that the home
secretary appoint the chairman of each police authority.
That provision brought a stinging attack last week from a succession of
former home secretaries led by Lord Whitelaw, still one of the most
influential figures in the Tory establishment. Lord Whitelaw argued that the
change would produce a dangerous politicisation of the police.
Mr Howard has yet to formalise the government's response, but it is
understood that he wants to react quickly rather than allow the issue to
drag on.
The government's education bill is already stalled in the House of Lords
because of strong opposition from - among others - Tory peers.
The view in Whitehall is that a decision by Mr Howard to cede the point on
the appointment of authority chairman would not undermine the central
objective of the legislation - to improve police efficiency.
The main elements in meeting that objective are seen instead as the plan to
end local authority dominance of police authorities and to give chief
constables much greater autonomy in local policing.
But it remains uncertain that the tactical retreat now being considered  -
and still to be approved by the cabinet - would defuse opposition to other
elements of the bill.
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, last week attacked a separate provision
authorising the appointment of new officials to manage the offices of
justices' clerks. He said this could threaten the impartiality of
magistrates' courts.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Benefit changes could swell jobless total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a quarter of a million people could be added to Britain's official
unemployment register as a result of government plans to tighten the rules
for claimants of invalidity benefit.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told MPs yesterday that
introducing a new system for disbursing invalidity benefit could mean that
between 1995 and 1997 a total of 280,000 current recipients would be forced
actively to seek work. Ministers have stressed these are 'worst case'
figures, and the number of people who end up claiming unemployment benefit
will depend on the strength of the economy and the number of jobs available.
However, one Conservative backbencher warned last night that the new system
of incapacity benefit could have a 'definite upward impact' on unemployment
in what could be the two years before a general election. The MP said:
'There is a presentational problem here, and it is one which has inhibited
the government from introducing this measure in the past. The government
will have to make a big effort on presentation and in finding training
schemes for those affected.'
Mr Lilley announced the potential impact of the measure at the start of a
second reading debate on the incapacity for work bill. The legislation will
bring in an objective medical test for all recipients of incapacity benefit
from April 1995.
Mr Lilley said the current system of invalidity benefit was open to abuse,
with the number of claimants trebling over the past 15 years. 'Is there
really an epidemic of incapacity?' he asked. 'Of course not.'
He assured MPs that about 800,000 current recipients of benefit with acute
medical problems would not be liable to a benefit review at all. But in
response to persistent questioning Mr Lilley said that about 95,000 people
could find themselves actively seeking work in the first year of the new
benefit, and 190,000 in the second.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the all-party social security committee,
said yesterday that the measures would effectively unwind the government's
Restart scheme, which in the late 1980s reduced the jobless numbers by
allowing more people to claim invalidity benefit. 'This legislation will
backfire on the government because the jobless figures will go up at the
wrong time,' he said.
However, Tory backbenchers were adamant that the measure, which will save
about Pounds 2bn in its first two years, needed to be introduced. Mr Matthew
Banks, Tory MP for Southport, said: 'Too many people are claiming the
benefit who are simply not entitled to it.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Heated response on Pepper Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Residents in Pepper Hill, Kent, were outraged yesterday by the announcement
of the route for Union Rail's channel tunnel rail link.
Committee members on the A2 Rail Action Group, who have campaigned for more
than three years for a rail route that would skirt the Pepper Hill estate of
355 homes near Gravesend, were disappointed that Mr John MacGregor had
postponed a decision on the precise route the rail link will take through
their community.
Daphne Bannister, a Pepper Hill resident for eight years, said: 'It makes me
sick - all this worry and upset and still we do not know any more than we
did before.'
Mr MacGregor's announcement that there will be no tunnel running under the
electricity switching station near the estate, however, drew hot protests
from committee members.
Mr Ted Gaish, a committee member said: 'Our position is that the tunnel goes
under the switching station or forget about it. The group is ready to fight
the route tooth and nail and the residents of Pepper Hill will not stand for
this.'
By eliminating the possibility of an underground tunnel beneath the
switching station, Mr MacGregor left two proposed route options open These
are: building a tunnel underneath estate homes, or building a viaduct over
nearby fields. Pepper Hill residents want neither of these options, but as
there is no decision on the route, they have no case yet for compensation,
and blight in the area is severe.
Mr Robert Hibbin bought his house in 1992 for Pounds 74,000 and in November
it was valued at Pounds 58,000. The surveyor noted that the effect of the
channel link had reduced the house's value.
Mr Hibbin said: 'We have been blighted on something that we are still not
sure is going to happen. But I think we will stay blighted until the rail
link is finished and that could be up to 10 years.'
Many residents have seen the value of their homes plunging for more than
three years. Pat and David Henderson, say the price of their home has fallen
from Pounds 95,000 in 1990 to Pounds 65,000 in October.
Mr Henderson said: 'When you have worked for 28 years hoping to retire when
you are 55-years-old with the property making a bit of money, and you find
you can't get a good price for it you find that your dreams of an early
retirement have been taken away.'
Mrs Henderson said the action group would now call a public meeting of all
residents and begin planning negotiations with Mr Jacques Arnold, their
local MP.
The group has considered legal action against Union Rail, although the cost
could be prohibitive.
Resident Deana King said: 'We can all see the benefits of the rail link but
we are being punished because we are not being compensated or treated
fairly.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Girobank staff vote to strike on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff at Girobank, a subsidiary of the Alliance and Leicester building
society, have voted by a comfortable majority to strike and take other forms
of industrial action in protest at a 1.5 per cent basic pay offer plus
Pounds 300 lump-sum bonus payments.
The executive of the National Communications Union is expected to notify the
bank that its 3,300 staff will begin an overtime ban from midnight on
Wednesday next week. Other disruption is likely to follow unless the bank
improves its offer. In the postal ballot 1,317 bank staff supported strike
action with 933 against.
The result was more overwhelming when staff were asked whether they were
ready to take action short of striking with 1,691 supporting that position
and 559 against. The turnout was just under 63 per cent.
Union officials pointed out that staff attitudes had hardened since last
autumn when they had recommended acceptance of the bank's offer in a
consultative ballot. The staff agreement ended on July 1.
The NCU say the staff feel the basic rise of 1.5 per cent is too low and too
much of the money increase is unconsolidated. But the bank said staff could
expect actual rises of 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent this year, around Pounds
500 on average.
It added the staff are angry that the offer is not generous enough, coming
after Girobank made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 64.4m in 1992, the best it
has ever made and senior management had secured substantial pay rises.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: India chooses operators for radio paging
service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's telecommunications department has chosen 15 companies to operate
radio paging services in 27 cities, nearly a year after more than 80
companies bid for licences.
The government's letters of intent to the companies, all joint ventures with
foreign partners, mark another step in India's attempts to part-privatise
the telecommunications sector.
Formal licences will be issued once the companies accept the terms and pay
licence fees and other charges.
The delay in announcing the contracts has been attributed partly to a court
action by unsuccessful bidders in last year's award of contracts for
cellular networks in Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, and partly to the
fact that India's telecommunications policy is still under review.
The government has given some companies as many as 10 licences to operate
competing services in big cities. Steamers Telecom and its Indian partner,
India Telecomp, owned by the Delhi-based Sanjay Dalmia group, has licences
for 10 cities, including Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras and Bangalore.
Hong Kong's Hutchison Max has licences for seven cities, while Arya
Communications, associated with Motorola of the US, has two, for Bombay and
Bangalore.
Other companies involved in the joint ventures include Fones West of the US,
Telecom International of New Zealand, Champion Technology of Hong Kong,
Singapore Telecom International, France Telecom Mobiles, and Easycall
Communications of the Philippines.
As many as three operators, constrained by a stipulation that applicants
have a foreign partner which could hold up to 51 per cent of the venture,
will compete in 15 cities, including the four largest - Delhi, Bombay,
Calcutta and Madras. Customers can be charged no more than Rs150 (Pounds
3.19) a month for the service. In Bombay, the country's most lucrative
market, the highest bid was Rs105m over the initial three-year period, which
would mean a revenue of Rs420m (Pounds 8.9m) for the department from the
four companies licensed for that city. Delhi commanded a peak fee of
Rs75.6m, followed by Rs45m in Madras and Rs42.3m in Calcutta.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Recycling has neighbours crying foul -
Complaints of cheap waste exports to European countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Germans dutifully put their waste paper into the blue bins on their
doorsteps, few could imagine that such environmental-mindedness has resulted
in a bitter battle of words with their European neighbours.
In 1993, Duales System Deutschland (DSD), the national waste management
scheme, collected 4.4m tonnes of used household packaging. Launched in
mid-1990, the organisation was set up after parliament adopted a
ground-breaking law which imposed collecting and recycling quotas on
packaging waste. Within two years DSD had extended its activities to nearly
all German households.
'Germans are the master collectors of the world,' Mr Klaus Topfer, federal
environment minister and architect of Germany's greenest laws, recently
boasted.
But the implementation of the ambitious recycling law has raised hackles in
Germany and in the European Union. The problem is that DSD has collected
more packaging waste than it can recycle in the country. So Germany has had
to export large quantities of waste.
In 1993 about a third of the 350,000 tonnes of plastic packaging waste
collected by DSD was exported to foreign countries. Similar numbers apply to
paper and other packaging materials, with the bulk of the exports ending up
in France and Britain.
Both these countries, in a colourful adaptation of the terminology of
international trade conflict, have indignantly accused Germany of dumping
subsidised waste materials in their countries, undermining their recycling
arrangements. With too much packaging waste in their hands, German recyclers
(which are paid by DSD to recycle the collected waste) have in turn offered
foreign companies a high price for taking German waste.
For example, German recyclers are believed to have paid up to DM600 (Pounds
235) a tonne to a foreign counterpart to get rid of plastic waste.
The practice has led to decreasing prices for some packaging waste,
especially paper, in other European countries and is hampering the growth of
their waste industries.
Britain and France, under pressure from their recycling companies,
especially those that do not have contracts with German partners, have
argued that Germany's ambitious recycling scheme leads to unfair trade
practices because it indirectly subsidises waste exports at the expense of
private recyclers abroad.
'Germany's waste policies are effectively killing other European recycling
schemes which assume that there is a positive price for used packaging,'
says Mr Thomas Carter, first secretary for the environment in the British
embassy in Bonn.
After 18 months of wrangling between members countries and lobbying by the
packaging industry, the other European environment ministers outvoted
Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark last December on an EU directive on
packaging waste.
The directive requires that, within five years, a minimum of 25 per cent of
packaging waste, and a maximum of 40 per cent, should be recycled. Within 10
years environment ministers would have to agree to 'substantial increases'
in these percentages.
The directive amounts to a slap in the face for Germany, whose own recycling
quotas are higher than those it lays down. Germany already recycles 66 per
cent of its used paper, 55 per cent of glass containers, and 48 per cent of
tin cans. Moreover, Germany's recycling law will increase these targets to
70 per cent for these three types of packagings from January 1 1996.
However, according to the directive, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark,
which also have ambitious recycling targets, will be able to continue
meeting their high quotas. But they will have to prove that they have
domestic recycling capacity for any amount collected above the EU limits.
Mr Topfer says he will fight to amend the directive when it goes before the
European Parliament. The German Environment Ministry argues that the EU
directive on packaging waste violates the free trade spirit of the EU. It
adds that, if the directive was adopted, Germany would bring the matter to
court, arguing that the EU treaty allows exceptions for member states in
matters relating to the environment.
'Our legal experts are studying the issue right now. Secondary raw material
should be traded freely in the European Union and no limits can legally be
imposed on such trade,' explains Mr Thomas Rummler, adviser at the Bonn
Environment Ministry.
Bonn says the issue has been exploited by French and British waste
management companies that do not have contracts with DSD and therefore have
not received money to take German waste. The ministry says British companies
exported 68,673 tonnes of used paper to Germany in 1992 - nearly three times
more than German companies exported to Britain.
According to officials at the French embassy, the directive has sparked
protests from waste management companies that would lose their contracts
with DSD. 'Those who were winning before are now crying out,' says an
official.
But the directive should allow for a harmonisation of waste recycling
schemes in other European countries so that distortions can be ironed out.
Most other European countries have adopted recycling schemes similar to
Germany's (such as the eco-emballage system in France) but which are
effective on much smaller scales.
In the long term, however, expanding recycling schemes will have to confront
the problem of falling prices for waste packaging and falling profits for
recyclers.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Swedes pick German tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish government has chosen the German tank, Leopard 2, for a
long-awaited multi-billion krona defence contract, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
It has ordered 120 in the improved S series and has the option to buy
between 160 and 200 second-hand Leopard 2s. A further 80 tanks in the new
series may be ordered, but a final decision on this is unlikely before 1997.
Mr Anders Bjorck, the Swedish defence minister, said yesterday the German
tank had been chosen rather than the French Leclerc and the US M1A2 Abrams
because it was significantly cheaper. He added that it had also performed
better in trials.
He declined to reveal the value of the contract, although it is believed to
be around SKr6bn (Pounds 500m). The order is being placed with Krauss Maffei
on the basis of significant counter-purchases.
The first tanks will be delivered in October 1996. Most will be assembled in
Sweden. Celsius, Sweden's leading defence group, said: 'Although it's too
early to say what counter-purchases will be involved, it will certainly be
worth several billion kronor to us.'

<TEXT>
Banque Nationale de Paris has syndicated finance for eastern Europe's first
concession motorway, designed to connect Hungary to the west European
network. Construction began in December on the Ecu 329m (Pounds 245m)
project.
A consortium led by Transroute International, a subsidiary of the French
highway operator, is building 42km of dual carriageway to complete Hungary's
M1 motorway between Budapest and the Austrian frontier. There it will link
up with Austria's A4 motorway to Vienna.
Completion is scheduled for the end of 1995, in time for the Budapest Expo
in 1996. Later a 15km spur will extend from the main route to the Slovakian
border to join up with the highway to Prague in the Czech Republic.
The motorway sections begun yesterday are missing links in the
Trans-European Motorway system (TEM) and between the two halves of Europe.
Eastern Europe's former communist regimes neglected highway development and
most countries' motorways do not extend far beyond their capital cities.
The M1 concession is also a test case for build-operate-transfer (BOT)
projects both in Hungary and in eastern Europe.
The private sector will finance total project costs, including capitalised
interest, of Ft32.5bn (Pounds 214m).
Members of the Elso Magyar Koncesszios Autopalya consortium will meet
roughly a fifth of the cost through equity. The London-based European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development is taking a 10 per cent stake and
France's Caisse des Depots et Consignations will hold 13.9 per cent.
Transroute International, the operator, will control only 4.2 per cent; and
Strabag, the Austrian building contractor, is the largest shareholder with
21 per cent.
The remainder of the financing will be evenly divided between
forint-denominated and international borrowing. The consortium plans to
issue forint bonds, stimulating Budapest's capital markets. The EBRD has
committed Ecu129m in equity and loan financing.
The Hungarian authorities hope that the progress of the M1 concession will
speed up similar tenders for three other motorways to link Budapest with
neighbouring countries. Completion of the motorway projects and two toll
bridges are expected to involve about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) in
investment.
The Transport Ministry's motorway directorate intends next month to name a
preferred bidder for construction of 130km of highway to take the M5
motorway south-east of Budapest towards the Serbian and Romanian borders.
In contention are a partnership of Grands Travaux de Marseilles and
Transroute, and another French consortium led by Bouygues, the building
contractor.
East European countries are faced with budgetary stringency and a pressing
need for infrastructural development to stimulate the economy and provide a
foundation for new investment.

FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: German chemicals giants target China

<TEXT>
More than five years after Chinese politicians first talked seriously about
opening up their economy, German chemicals companies are at last starting to
invest serious money in the People's Republic.
Late last year, for example, Bayer signed an umbrella deal, committing a
preliminary Dollars 200m (Pounds 135.1m) to half a dozen joint manufacturing
ventures and licensing deals to make products ranging from fly sprays and
Agfa film to engineering plastics.
It capped the agreement with the establishment of a holding company in
Beijing to take care of central administration and steer negotiations with
future joint venture partners.
BASF, making a similar push, is pressing on with further investments in
dyestuffs to feed the booming Chinese textiles industry.
A joint venture deal with its 49 per cent partner, Shanghai Dyestuffs, will
start production next year. The company is also ready to invest in new
capacity to produce monostyrene and polystyrene, suitable for numerous
applications in consumer and industrial markets.
The company will sign the joint venture contract early in February.
Mr Jurgen Strube, BASF chairman, is reluctant to discuss the scale of his
spending plans, divulging only that the investment would be more than DM100m
(Pounds 39m).
However, he made the tendency plain late last year when he said that his new
medium-term investment programme for the company's chemicals business
(excluding gas) allocated 35 per cent of the total to German operations,
compared with 45 per cent in the five years to the end of 1993.
Both Bayer and BASF, which already have annual sales of around DM500m each
in China, have concluded that political and business conditions make early
investment essential. 'Exports from Europe are not economic if you consider
them on a full-cost basis,' says Mr Strube.
Far Eastern chemicals suppliers, such as those in Hong Kong and Singapore,
which increased their annual exports into world markets by an average 22 per
cent and 17 per cent respectively during the 1980s, are far more
conveniently placed.
But China also wants inward investment both to supply its home market and
earn foreign exchange. With the likes of Du Pont and Shell busily examining
prospective joint-venture partners, the Germans cannot afford to be left
behind.
Political uncertainty remains a concern, and continued economic growth at
recent rates cannot be assured. But on the basis of market considerations,
the time is right to move, says Mr Strube.
'China has the capacity to absorb a huge amount of chemicals. Plant for many
of our products requires minimum capacities to be competitive, and it is
only in the past two years that demand has reached a scale which makes
investment economic,' he adds.
Although he refuses to discuss planned polystyrene capacity, he notes that
China's current requirements are mostly imported and that there are almost
limitless possibilities for applications in packaging and industrial and
consumer products in a developing industrial nation.
However, Mr Strube acknowledges that there are still hurdles to be overcome,
including some set up by western industry in the past. 'China in the past
was always a market where people exported their excess capacity. The
competition was very stiff and the Chinese have always been very good
entrepreneurs,' he says.
'The trouble is they are used to buying chemicals at low prices and they
find it very hard to give that up.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Aspin's deputy named as defence secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr William Perry, deputy US defence
secretary, to move up into the top Pentagon post in place of Mr Les Aspin,
taking on a position that Mr Clinton has found difficulty filling to his
satisfaction. He said Mr Perry was 'a real pro' who had 'the right vision
for the job'.
After asking Mr Aspin to resign, Mr Clinton had named retired Admiral Bobby
Ray Inman as his successor, but Adm Inman last week withdrew his name,
complaining of a conspiracy of newspaper columnists against him.
Although Mr Clinton said yesterday that the job was 'absolutely,
categorically not offered to anyone else', efforts were made to interest
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, or former
Senator Warren Rudman, a respected Republican expert on defence and
budgetary issues.
Mr Perry, a 66-year-old mathematician whose role as number two at the
Pentagon has centred on management and acquisition issues, told the White
House on Saturday that if pressed for an immediate decision, he would have
to say no, for family reasons.
By Sunday afternoon, however, he had agreed to take the job.
In President Jimmy Carter's administration, Mr Perry headed the Pentagon's
research operations and was an early champion of stealth technology.
Before returning to Washington last year he was managing director of
Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco investment banking firm, and headed a
Silicon Valley consultancy.
He said yesterday that implementing the force structure proposed by Mr
Aspin's 'Bottom Up Review' within Mr Clinton's proposed defence budget would
be difficult but achieveable.
'In order to carry out the Bottom Up Review with the funds proposed for it
we will have to manage the Pentagon very well,' he said.
Although he is expected to be more organised than the intellectually fertile
but sometimes unfocused Mr Aspin, Mr Perry's limited political or foreign
policy experience means he is unlikely to be the answer Mr Clinton has been
looking for to the shortcomings in his national security decision-making
structures.
Mr Aspin will stay at the Pentagon until Mr Perry has been through
confirmation by the Senate.

<TEXT>
Long-awaited reforms to Chile's capital markets, due to be discussed by the
house of deputies today, are expected to become law by the end of the month.
The reforms, championed by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance
minister, seek to broaden options available to Chile's powerful investment
institutions and to regulate the stock market more effectively.
Deputies will vote on amendments to the bill introduced last week in the
Senate intended to expand investment possibilities and to soften some of the
bill's regulatory clauses. This is the final stage of a year-long
legislative process which has been hostage to party bickering and relentless
lobbying of congressmen.
New legislation will allow privatised pension funds (AFPs), which have
amassed savings of Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) since 1981, to increase their
foreign investments and to expand options at home. The amount AFPs can
invest abroad will be raised over four years from the present ceiling of 3
per cent of funds to 12 per cent. The original bill, before Senate
amendments, envisaged a 10 per cent maximum.
There will also be a 6 per cent floor in an effort to force pension funds to
spread their risk. Chileans are obliged by law to invest 10 per cent of
their earnings in an AFP.
At home, pension funds will be allowed to buy stock in a broader range of
companies and to provide project funding and venture capital.

<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court ruled yesterday that anti-abortion protesters who block
clinics can be sued under the tough US racketeering law, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The decision by Chief Justice William Rehnquist overturned a lower court
ruling that anti-abortion protesters were not covered by the federal
racketeering law.
Judge Rehnquist said the racketeering law does not require proof that the
protesters' actions were motivated by an economic purpose. Anti-abortion
groups argued they were motivated by moral and political reasons and thus
were not covered by the law.
The ruling was a major victory for the Clinton administration and for
abortion rights activists, who have long sought to use the racketeering law
to deter the blocking of entrances to clinics and the harassment of
employees and women seeking abortions.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Clinton, riding high, heads for rough country: On eve of the
State of the Union address. Jurek Martin reviews the state of the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By one yardstick, President Bill Clinton has good reason to look forward to
presenting his first official State of the Union address to Congress
tonight.
He will speak after a first year of legislative achievement unmatched by any
newly-elected president since Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, with the economy
cruising along very nicely and a budget deficit now projected at a mere
Dollars 180bn (Pounds 122bn), and, in consequence, with his own popularity
rising back to where it was when he assumed office.
He could take encouragement from the fact that his initial address to
Congress last February (technically not a State of the Union message) was
considered by all a raging success and that he has clearly taken the
leadership in enunciating public concerns about the great issues of the
moment - healthcare, crime and gun control, and reform of the welfare
system.
By another measurement, however, his remains an afflicted presidency, still
struggling to find consistency. He is currently embarrassed by problems
finding a new defence secretary, troubled by the Whitewater investigations
into his financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s, and, overseas,
disturbed that the Russian commitments to reform given him in Moscow only 10
days ago now look very suspect, while the situation in Bosnia deteriorates
by the hour.
Moreover, both parties in Congress remain deeply divided over what to do
about healthcare, crime and welfare reform, reducing the president's chances
of clear cut victories. Mr Clinton declared over the weekend that 'gridlock'
was over, a post-North American Free Trade Agreement sentiment officially
shared by the leadership of both parties, but declarations of its demise may
yet, like reports of Mark Twain's death, prove premature.
Even before any of the big issues come to the crunch on Capitol Hill, his
most immediate problem is next month's Senate debate on the balanced budget
amendment. Passage against his wishes would not only encourage Republicans
but might persuade Democrats up for re-election in November to desert the
presidential cause on other matters.
Also, Ross Perot, the third force in contemporary US politics, promised over
the weekend to mobilise his troops in favour of the balanced budget and
against healthcare reform. Many members of Congress are afraid of his
grassroots power.
Still, one of the great advantages of the ceremonial State of the Union
message is that it gives the president an unchallenged pulpit to go over the
heads of a carping capital and talk to the nation about his agenda and
rationale. The specifics may be lightly touched on but the broad themes are
intended to strike important national chords.
Mr Clinton has done this effectively in a series of recent speeches on the
question of individual responsibilities to social issues aimed both at
minorities and at the broad middle class. Tonight's address is likely to
draw heavily on the one he gave last October in Memphis at the Rev Martin
Luther King's old church in which he urged communities not to wait for the
government to solve all their problems.
This theme cuts across party lines and underpins Mr Clinton's own claim to
be a 'new kind of Democrat' practising simultaneously fiscal responsibility
and a tough, but caring, approach to social problems, including crime (the
president may well endorse the populist drive to impose mandatory life
sentences on anyone convicted of three violent offences).
Inter-connected inside this framework are all the component parts of his
ambitious domestic agenda, which, he is convinced with some justification,
are broadly what the country wants and needs. Several recent polls have
found that crime and healthcare have supplanted the economy, the focus of
his first year, as the dominant national concern.
It is likely, therefore, that domestic issues will dwarf foreign policy in
tonight's address. Whatever his apparent difficulties overseas, the public,
into which he is so finely tuned, simply does not follow the twists and
turns in Russia, Bosnia and elsewhere.
A Washington Post poll published over the weekend found 67 per cent
satisfied with his conduct of external relations, even though a
hypercritical Washington establishment fumes daily over the shortcomings of
his foreign policy team's performance.
Thus it may be sufficient for Mr Clinton merely to point to the Nafta
victory and Uruguay Round trade accord, to promise to maintain pressure on
Japan to open its markets, to highlight Nato's new approach to the former
Warsaw Pact countries and to re-emphasise his commitment to democracy and
reform in Russia and elsewhere in eastern Europe.
He could, if he wanted, borrow one line from his speech in Brussels two
weeks ago about the impossibility of the US controlling 'every event in
every country every day'.
But the Clinton target tonight will be the audiences that helped put him in
office to solve national problems. He will claim he has made a very good
start but that much tough sledding lies ahead. Not long after he sits down,
predictable applause ringing in his ears, he will be finding out again how
tough it can be.

companies available for AFP investment will be raised from the current 40 or
so blue chips to more than 200.
The bill also includes a stiffer regulatory framework to ensure new freedoms
are not abused. New rules will be introduced on corporate governance,
privileged information, and the independence of AFP directors - though some
of these elements were weakened at the Senate stage.
Nevertheless, prison sentences are to be introduced for cases relating to
the abuse of confidential information. Also, brokerage houses with members
represented on the board of a company will be prohibited from dealing in
stock of that company.
Together with reforms of the banking sector, also close to becoming law, Mr
Foxley said the new law would 'permit an enormous impulse towards the
modernisation of Chile's financial sector'.

Venezuela's banking system, shaken by the failure of Banco Latino this
month, is now facing a wave of heavy withdrawals by important clients,
bankers said yesterday, Joseph Mann reports from Caracas.
At the end of last week, corporations and wealthy individuals began to make
large withdrawals from several commercial banks, and demand for US dollars
spiralled to an estimated Dollars 350m-Dollars 500m last Friday, according
to some estimates. These figures represent several times the usual daily
volumes of dollar sales.
Heavy withdrawals continued yesterday, bankers said, and demand for dollars
remained strong. About 11 of the more than 40 commercial banks are reported
on the central bank's 'watch list' and have had liquidity problems in recent
days.
Most holders of small accounts appear not to have been panicked by the
crisis.
The government yesterday began to provide banks suffering from 'temporary
liquidity problems' with liberal financing under an emergency assistance
plan announced last week. At the same time, officials and representatives of
the banking community told the public to ignore rumours and trust the
banking system.
Hundreds of account holders at Banco Latino blocked traffic in central
Caracas yesterday, demanding immediate payment of their deposits. The
government has issued confusing information on when the bank will reopen and
how much depositors will receive initially. Currently, the plan is to reopen
the failed bank today or tomorrow and reimburse clients with deposits of up
to Dollars 925 (Pounds 625).

Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation appear to have struck a
compromise on security at border crossings, paving the way for the
long-delayed implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank area of Jericho.
Egyptian, Israeli and PLO officials yesterday said there had been a
breakthrough after two months of bitter dispute about who should control the
Gaza-Egypt and Jericho-Jordan borders. A final agreement could be possible
this weekend when Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, meets Mr Yassir
Arafat, PLO chairman, in Switzerland.
Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, who visited Israel yesterday
to help consolidate the progress made between the two sides, said: 'All of
us know that a lot of progress has already been made. . . so the remaining
points are indeed few.'
Mr Peres said after meeting Mr Moussa: 'We've created the basis for an
agreement with the PLO. . . We don't have an agreement yet but we have the
basis of such an agreement.'
Officials stressed that further work was needed on two other issues: the
size of the Jericho area and the size of an Israeli military security zone
around Jewish settlements which will remain in Gaza. But they said
resolution of the border issue made agreement on other issues much easier.
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting at the Egyptian Red Sea resort
of Taba briefly discussed less sensitive matters such as telecommunications,
then decided to suspend talks until after the Arafat-Peres meeting.
Officials said the turning point in the stalled talks had come after Israel
agreed to accede to a PLO demand that Israeli security checks of
Palestinians at the border would be conducted by 'invisible' electronic
technology rather than physical contact. The PLO, in return, had agreed to
withdraw a demand for a Palestinian police presence on the crossings. Israel
had also offered free passage of Palestinians from the Jordan border into
Jericho after the PLO gave up its demand for control of roads leading to the
border.
Mr Yoel Singer, legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry, and Mr Ahmed
Qurie (Abu Ala'a) of the PLO are expected to meet in Paris tomorrow to draft
an agreement before Sunday's Peres-Arafat meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, signalled he had agreed to the
compromise and said there had been 'improvement' in the talks, but warned
that obstacles still remained.
The apparent breakthrough came as Israeli delegations prepared to meet
separately and in secret with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestinians in
Washington to resume the search for a comprehensive Middle East peace.
Mr Arafat yesterday met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for the first time since
1990 to try to settle differences and win back Saudi financial and political
support suspended after the PLO backed Iraq in the Gulf war. Saudi Radio
said Mr Arafat and the king met in the capital Riyadh.

<TEXT>
Japanese share prices plunged yesterday amid fears of political turmoil
following the defeat of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform
bill.
The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares fell 954.19 points or 4.9 per cent,
the largest single-day drop since August 1991, as shaken investors and
dealers, who had accumulated shares in anticipation of the vote's passage
through parliament, rushed to unload their holdings. The unexpected
rejection of the reform bill came after the Tokyo market closed on Friday,
depressing Japanese stocks traded overseas.
Early today stocks showed a firmer trend, with the Nikkei average about 150
points above its close yesterday of 18,353.24 after an hour's trading. Ms
Manae Kubota, the Economic Planning Agency minister, said the recovery
reflected expectations that the government would soon take steps to
stimulate the economy.
However, traders expect further turbulence on the Tokyo stock market this
week due to the uncertainty surrounding Mr Hosokawa's efforts to formulate a
compromise package of the reform bills by Saturday. 'There's no knowing how
much the market could fall if Mr Hosokawa is forced to resign,' warned Mr
Takashi Kanasaki, a director at Yamaichi Securities.
But Mr Hosokawa yesterday put on a brave face, saying share prices would
rise eventually, while Mr Jiro Saito, the vice-finance minister, said the
fall in the stock market would not change the government's assessment of
economic conditions.
If pessimism among domestic investors persists, buying by European and US
investors, who have so far supported Japanese stocks in favour of weak
south-east Asian stock markets, may also peter out.
On the foreign exchange market, worries over political confusion also
prompted selling of the yen against the dollar yesterday; it closed down
Y0.80 at Y112.10.
The diminishing prospects of an imminent revival in the economy also fuelled
hopes of an early cut in the official discount rate.
Yields on the No 157 10-year benchmark bond declined 11.5 basis points to
3.205 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 94 / London cabinet backs Patten over Hong Kong reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government will not proceed to the second stage of its
electoral reform plans until the fate of a first bill, now before the
Legislative Council, is clear, Mr Chris Patten, the governor, said
yesterday.
Mr Patten held consultations in London with a cabinet sub-committee
including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, on the future course of the governor's proposals to
broaden the democratic franchise in the crown colony.
The cabinet proffered strong support to Mr Patten, giving him discretion to
decide, in consultation with Mr Hurd, on the content and timing of the
second stage of the the reforms.
Speaking after the meeting at Downing Street, Mr Hurd said that no decisions
had been taken about the second bill, but that legislation had to be in
place by July for elections in 1994 and 1995 to be held in an orderly way.
Mr Patten said: 'We will obviously be deciding on which is the best way
forward in the light of our success in getting the first bill through and
other factors at the time.'
The first bill covers issues said by Britain to be non-controversial. The
proposals to which China most objects have been left for possible inclusion
in the second.
Mr Hurd and Mr Patten repeated a call for Beijing to resume negotiations
which broke down in November after 17 fruitless rounds. China, which assumes
sovereignty in 1997, says it will overturn reforms introduced without its
agreement.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Vietnam's communists fear their success: Cadres meet to
review the market reforms that have alienated many
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam government officials and Communist party cadres are gathered in
Hanoi to assess the progress of their market reforms, which are rapidly
transforming the economy.
Since they were first hesitatingly introduced in 1986, the reforms have made
remarkable progress - perhaps too much, in the eyes of party leaders who are
worried that they are losing control of the economy and losing touch with
the population.
There is no suggestion that Vietnam's economic transformation will be halted
but senior party officials are worried about the social consequences of the
reforms they have introduced.
Rising unemployment and a widening gap between the mostly urban rich and the
rural poor are causing social tensions which some party cadres fear could
surface in an imitation of recent peasant unrest in China.
Vietnam is now one of only five countries ruled by a Communist party and
party leaders are acutely conscious of the fate of their former allies in
eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, much of which they blame on the
reforms introduced by President Mikhail Gorbachev and his supporters.
This is the first time the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has held a
national conference mid-way through the five-year cycle between congresses.
In Vietnam, as in the country's huge northern neighbour, China, the party is
trying to reform the economy while resisting calls for any change to the
political structure. The party is still the only legal one in Vietnam and
its leaders have no plans to relinquish its power.
Now they are increasingly worried that they are losing touch with ordinary
people in the country, especially with young people who have diminishing
loyalty to the ageing revolutionaries who still run the country.
'We should carry out properly the task of broadening the party's membership,
especially among the youth and women,' general secretary Do Muoi told the
conference. 'We should rejuvenate the party ranks.'
Mr Do Muoi and his colleagues have reason to worry. Young people in Hanoi
are becoming increasingly rebellious and appear to be more interested in
western music and culture, than party politics.
Last year, some 50,000 people joined the party, which now has a membership
of almost 3m out of a population of 71m. However, many people say they
joined the party because they had to or simply to boost their job prospects,
rather than for any deep ideological commitment.
Party leaders, many of whom are in their sixties or seventies, are widely
seen as out of touch with ordinary people who have to adapt rapidly to their
changing lives.
On the streets of the capital, few people are even aware that the national
conference is taking place and even those who do know show little interest.
To mark the occasion, Party buildings and main roads through the Vietnamese
capital are festooned with red and gold banners proclaiming 'Long Live the
Glorious Communist Party of Vietnam]' and 'Our President Ho Chi Minh Lives
With Us Forever]'
One woman selling piles of oranges and apples by the roadside commented: 'Oh
yes, they always have banners for something. I don't know what these are
for, though.' She and the other traders nearby, several of whom had recently
lost their jobs at state-run factories, said they had more pressing concerns
such as making enough money to feed their families.
Elsewhere, a young woman was sitting in front of a newly bought television,
apparently not paying much attention to a report on the evening news about
the party conference. 'They just talk and talk and talk,' she said, 'but
they don't do anything.'
This may sound just like the routine grumblings of people in many countries
about their politicians. What makes these comments so remarkable in Vietnam
is that just two or three years ago almost nobody would have dared to say
these things, certainly not to a passing foreigner.
The report to the national conference by the party central committee makes
repeated calls for political stability and stresses the need for vigilance
against 'all plots and acts of the enemy', 'the scheme and acts of 'peaceful
evolution' by hostile forces' and 'the way of life consisting in running
after money'.
However, outside the party's inner halls, people from all levels of society
want to run after money; they are being encouraged by the government to
start small businesses and to make profits. Throughout Hanoi, and across
Vietnam, people are heeding this call. Tens of thousands of cafes, shops and
other small enterprises have opened in the past few years.
In other ways, many young people have also become alienated from the party.
They gather in cafes to listen to western rock music and race their
motorcycles around the streets of the capital late at night.
To these people, who are searching for new influences and ways to escape the
controls of the party, Mr Do Muoi's warning against 'the tendency towards
'commercialisation', propagation of heterogeneous cultures and depraved way
of life' is faintly ludicrous.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Mozambique's fragile peace process risks too-easy
derailment: A nightmare scenario is of ex-soldiers turning into armed
bandits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MAPUTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Against the odds, the peace accord which ended Mozambique's 17-year civil
war has held for over a year. Like everything else in this exhausted
country, the peace agreement has been designed, financed and implemented by
western donors, in one of the most radical experiments in foreign
intervention of Africa's post-colonial history.
The United Nations is spending Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 405,000) a day on its
peacekeeping operation in Mozambique. The World Bank and the donor community
are pumping Dollars 1bn into the economy this year, an amount equal to the
country's entire gross domestic product.
Foreign advisers provide Mozambique with a semblance of government. Donors
will also be paying for the country's first multi-party elections scheduled
for October, the demobilisation of two rival armies, and the repatriation of
1.5m refugees.
Some donors are even willing to finance the transformation of the Mozambique
National Resistance (Renamo) rebel movement into a political party. Renamo
atrocities are hardly ever mentioned in Mozambique today. Despite this huge
and concerted international effort, there is much that could derail
Mozambique's fragile peace process.
The demobilisation of government and Renamo soldiers is behind schedule,
which in turn has delayed formation of a new, integrated army. Both the
government and Renamo agree elections cannot take place until the old armies
have disbanded.
To date only 13,000 troops (less than a fifth of the estimated total) have
shown up at the assembly areas set up by the UN late last year.
Few weapons are being handed over to the UN military observers. Instead, a
brisk cross-border arms trade goes on, with many of the weapons originally
supplied by Pretoria to destabilise Mozambique's Marxist government finding
their way back to their country of origin. Mr Aldo Ajello, an Italian
diplomat in charge of the UN Mozambique operation, says the peace process is
being delayed because of indiscipline in government ranks.
For many officers, the end of the war spells an end to lucrative
side-businesses such as smuggling. Others fear there will be no place for
them in the new 30,000-strong army, and do not believe government promises
of six months' wages to help them start civilian lives. Most of them are
owed back pay, and there have been riots.
'The greatest threat to the peace process is the 20,000 officers and
non-commissioned officers who will be jobless after the October elections,'
says an ambassador in Maputo. 'The economy is too weak to employ them.' 'My
nightmare scenario', says another diplomat, 'is disgruntled former soldiers
terrorising the countryside as armed bandits.'
Donor governments are now discussing a special aid package to pay the
salaries of some 55,000 demobilised soldiers for up to two years. The World
Bank estimates it would cost Dollars 20m.
A more immediate financial concern is to set up Renamo's leader, Mr Afonso
Dhlakama, in business. Mr Ajello persuaded the UN to establish a Dollars
7.5m trust fund to help budding political parties in the former one-party
state.
But the trust fund has proved to be too paltry and too restrictive for Mr
Dhlakama's needs. 'Dhlakama is regarded as an African chief,' explains Mr
Ajello, 'and he needs to be able to act like one. He needs money to pension
off his generals, to distribute largesse.'
Again, donors are trying to come up with a political war-chest of Dollars 4m
to help Mr Dhlakama fight the forthcoming elections. Mr Ajello admits the
plan is controversial, but he believes donor governments must pioneer the
funding of new political groups if democracy in Africa is to have a chance.
'When we have a peace-keeping operation that costs Dollars 600,000 a day,
Dollars 4m is a small premium to ensure the future stability of Mozambique,'
Mr Ajello says.
Mr Dhlakama, for his part, says he will not contest the elections unless the
donors come up with the goods. 'We signed the peace accord because the
international community promised us money,' he says. 'We need offices,
vehicles, accommodation for my men who are coming out of the bush. If we
don't get the money, we won't go back to war. But we won't fight an election
on unequal terms.'
Above all, Mr Dhlakama needs money to be able to employ advisers capable of
devising a political programme for Renamo, a movement with no coherent
ideology, no nationwide organisation and no governing skills.
If elections were held tomorrow, many believe Renamo would win. The
Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo), in power since independence in 1975,
has almost exhausted its credibility with the country's long-suffering
inhabitants.
Frelimo lost its political direction when it abandoned Marxism in favour of
World Bank funding in the mid-1980s. Government has become paralysed by
Frelimo's internal power struggles, with Marxists fighting the new
technocrats and black supremacists seeking to squeeze out the few whites who
continue to hold public office. President Joaquim Chissano seems incapable
of dealing with the rival factions.
Even if the demobilisation exercise is completed in May, logistical
difficulties remain in the organisation of national elections in a country
which has never voted, where the vast majority of the 16m people are
illiterate and one-quarter of the population is still displaced by the war.
While some foreign observers fear donors may be forcing the pace of
Mozambique's transition to democracy, others argue that elections are
desperately needed to invest the new government with the legitimacy that
both Frelimo and Renamo lack.
Mr Ajello, while promising to complete the UN's mission by the October
deadline, sounds a note of caution: 'Whoever loses the election will feel
that he has also lost the war. That is why the opposition must be given a
political and economic stake in the future of this country.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / Vehicle output falling behind US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese vehicle production recorded its sharpest fall for 19 years,
underlining the depressed state of the economy, according to a report on the
car industry published yesterday.
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said vehicle output fell by
10.2 per cent last year to 11.2m units and projected that it would fall
below 11m this year.
As a result, Japan is expected to lose its status as the world's largest car
producer, relinquishing its position to the US for the first time since
1979, according to the organisation.
Car output fell by 9.4 per cent in 1993 to 8.5m units, the third consecutive
year of decline. Exports of all vehicles fell by an estimated 11 per cent to
5m units, reflecting the impact of the strong yen, while domestic sales were
down by just over 7 per cent.
Among the leading carmakers, Mazda was the worst performer, with a 19.7 per
cent fall in output, followed by Nissan, with a 14.5 per cent decline.
Further evidence that the end-of-year gift-buying season failed to encourage
Japanese consumer demand came with the publication of figures showing a 1.8
per cent drop in December sales from the Japan Chain Stores Association.
That brings to 2.4 per cent the decline in chain store sales for the whole
of 1993.
The Bank of Japan yesterday contradicted recent market speculation that it
might try to stimulate demand by cutting its official discount rate, which
has stood at a record low of 1.75 per cent since last September.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, said the easing in credit over
the past few months was creating the conditions for a recovery. Companies
had made progress in reducing excess stocks, but personal consumption and
industrial investment remained 'lacklustre', said Mr Mieno. He was
addressing the start of a two-day meeting of branch managers, whose reports
on regional economic conditions will be an influence on the bank's monetary
stance.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Hosokawa begins moves to salvage political reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday made no headway
in trying to salvage an agreement on political reform before his time runs
out at the end of the week.
Parliamentary officials of the ruling seven-party coalition last night met
members of the opposition Liberal Democratic party to try to form a joint
panel of the upper and lower houses, as a forum for hammering out a
compromise.
They failed to agree, and plan to meet again today.
The LDP blamed 'co-ordination' problems. The party is divided between a
minority who seek a watered-down version of the political reform plans - the
leadership's official line - and a majority who have strong reservations
over the proposed abandonment of Japan's multi-seat constituency system.
In one small sign of possible progress, the leadership of the Social
Democratic (socialist) party, the largest coalition partner, said it was
ready to meet the LDP. There proved to be more anti-reform socialist rebels
than had been expected, and it was their defection which resulted in the
upper house voting down the reform plans last Friday.
If, as is likely, Mr Hosokawa fails to get an agreement by the end of this
parliamentary session on Saturday at midnight, the bills will expire. Mr
Hosokawa will then be under pressure to carry out his implied promise to
resign, despite the fact that he is Japan's most popular politician.
The Keidanren, the leading business federation, yesterday called on him not
to dissolve parliament and call a snap general election. Prolonged political
uncertainty would further damage the economy, warned Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the
Keidanren's chairman. He called on the government and opposition to join
forces to enact political reform and to complete a long-delayed economic
stimulus package forthwith. Political observers believe that if Mr Hosokawa
does resign, he would hand over the prime ministership to a leading member
of the seven-party coalition, rather than calling an election straight away.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and leader of the Japan Renewal party, set
up last June by defectors from the LDP, or Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of
the New Harbinger party, another former LDP splinter group, are mentioned by
Japanese political commentators as front-runners for the job.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday gave a further indication of its readiness to discuss human
rights with the west by agreeing to receive a senior US government
specialist on the issue in Beijing next month.
Following a meeting between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state, and Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, in Paris yesterday, it
was agreed that Mr John Shattuck, the US assistant secretary for human
rights, would visit the Chinese capital to help Washington determine whether
to renew most favoured nation trade treatment for China's exports.
Mr Qichen said he did not believe the question of trade should be linked to
that of human rights - as they are in US legislation - 'but we are ready to
discuss all these issues'. US officials described yesterday's meeting, which
also touched on the problem of North Korea's possible nuclear weapon
ambitions, as constituting another step in the gradual improvement of
Sino-American relations.
More obliquely, Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, used a
separate meeting yesterday with Mr Qichen to underline to the Chinese
minister 'the need, in an increasingly unified world, for a certain
relationship between general conceptions of human rights'.
But, in its eagerness to make up for its recent exclusion from the Chinese
market, France is far from making Beijing's human rights record a
pre-condition for a better commercial relationship. Indeed, Mr Balladur who
is to visit China in March, has agreed to Beijing's condition that France
will sell no more offensive weapons to Taiwan, beyond its recent sales of
Mirage jets and navy frigates.

FT  25 JAN 94 / US pledges backing for Bosnia action

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and France yesterday sought to play down divisions in western policy
towards Bosnia with a pledge by the US that it would join in possible air
strikes in Bosnia in support of United Nations efforts to protect and feed
refugees.
After meeting his French opposite number, Mr Alain Juppe, Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, said: 'It is now understood the US
is prepared to carry out its commitment at Nato to use air power.'
The meeting, which had ostensibly been called to 'clarify' the French and US
position towards Bosnia, came as confusion over the threatened air strikes
risked reopening divisions within the alliance over Bosnia.
Two weeks ago the Nato summit had warned of possible air strikes if UN
forces were thwarted in opening the Bosnian airport of Tuzla to aid and in
relieving peacekeepers in Srebrenica. using Mr Juppe said: 'We are going to
try to do this, and if anyone tries to stop us we will use air power.'
In Washington, however, President Bill Clinton took a more pessimistic view,
doubting that international action could stop the carnage in Bosnia until
the Serbs, Moslems and Croats 'make up their own mind to quit killing each
other'. He implied that the allies, in consultation with the UN, were still
not agreed when and where to deploy air strikes.
On the diplomatic front, French President Francois Mitterrand told Mr
Christopher that France would soon put forward new proposals relating to the
war in Bosnia, but did not give any details.
Earlier Mr Juppe indicated his hope that a stronger US endorsement of the
European Union proposal to carve Bosnia into three ethnic regions would
increase the chances of it being accepted.
The comments came as Britain, France and Canada stepped up their discussions
over the possible withdrawal of the United Nations protection forces in
Bosnia. Following the visit by Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary,
to Bosnia last week, he is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, in New York next Monday before going on to Washington for
discussions with Mr Christopher.
Meanwhile in Zagreb, General Jean Cot, the outgoing French commander of UN
troops in former Yugoslavia, yesterday said reforms were under way to
improve peacekeeping. He spoke after swearing in General Sir Michael Rose of
Britain as the new deputy in charge of UN troops in Bosnia.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Diplomatic woes complicate Macedonia's reform efforts: The
many obstacles to viable statehood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Savo Stankovic, Macedonia's leading exporter of printed circuit boards,
points to the factory he is having built outside Skopje, the capital: 'If
things were different, that plant would be on an industrial estate in
Greece.'
Until two years ago Computronica, Mr Stankovic's company, received most of
its orders from Greek electronics suppliers. But after Greece refused to
recognise the former Yugoslav republic, on the grounds that its name
amounted to a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia,
his Greek customers 'telephoned to say they were under official pressure to
stop doing business with Skopje'.
'Business was growing so fast I'd planned to apply for incentives offered
under the Greek foreign investment law, for manufacturing high-tech products
there. Instead, I was questioned by the Greek police during a business trip
and then refused a visa.'
Because bank loans were not available while Macedonia was struggling for
international recognition, Mr Stankovic had to invest his own capital,
together with funds provided by German customers, to build the Dollars 8m
(Pounds 5.4m) plant at home. He says he already has orders, worth Dollars
650,000 a month, from Germany and Turkey.
Mr Stankovic's experience underlines how Balkan politics have exacerbated
the problems facing Macedonian businesses since the republic broke away from
Yugoslavia in 1991. Just as Macedonia was starting the transition to a
market economy, UN sanctions were imposed against Serbia, its main trading
partner.
Although Macedonia is now a UN member developing ties with several European
Union member states, Greece continues to harass its neighbour, refusing
entry to Macedonian passport-holders and delaying shipments of oil and other
Skopje-bound goods that come through the northern port of Thessaloniki,
Macedonia's closest outlet to the sea.
Greece objects not just to Macedonia's name, but to its flag, which carries
a sunburst symbol associated with the northern Greek dynasty of Alexander
the Great, and its constitution, thought by the Greeks to endorse an
expansionist vision of uniting with Greek Macedonia.
The underlying fear is that Greece's Slav-speaking minority, never fully
assimilated and with strong ties to Macedonia, could one day adopt a
political platform calling for self-determination.
Hopes that Greece's current responsibility as EU president for promoting a
common foreign policy would stimulate a change in attitude were dashed at
the outset, when Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou refused to rule out
closing the border with Macedonia.
However, last night Mr Papandreou said Greece was ready to hold talks with
Macedonia under United Nations auspices if it offered 'practical examples'
of being prepared to reach a compromise.
Mr Papandreou, opening a debate on the Macedonia issue, sounded more
moderate than in the past, making clear that Greece wanted Macedonia to
survive as an independent state. The Greek government was willing to
contribute to Macedonia's development, but still refused to recognise
Macedonia under that name.
Mr Kiro Gligorov, Macedonia's president, has said he is willing to sign an
agreement guaranteeing the border with Greece. He adds: 'We want to start
the dialogue with Greece in New York, under UN sponsorship, and work out a
package solution covering all our differences.'
Two years of diplomatic and economic isolation have taken a heavy toll, with
gross domestic product falling by more than 30 per cent since 1991. Per
capita income has dropped by half to less than Dollars 700.
Industrial production is collapsing, with Macedonia's steel and nickel
producers both close to shutting down because of difficulties in exporting.
The textile industry is operating at 30 per cent of capacity, according to
government officials.
A severe drought cut agricultural output last year by more than 20 per cent
and halted exports of early vegetables.
On the advice of the International Monetary Fund, Macedonia took the unusual
step of asking for donations from abroad to cover repayment of Dollars 85m
in debt owed to the World Bank.
Although the government hoped that Ecu50m (Pounds 39m) in aid promised last
year by EU member states could be used to cover the debt, only Dollars 20m
of that amount has been pledged so far, with the US contributing another
Dollars 5m. However, Mr George Soros, the international financier, has come
to the rescue, promising the Macedonian government a short-term bridging
loan.
The government has already agreed with the IMF on an economic reform
programme, in return for a stand-by facility of Dollars 35m this year. Once
its World Bank arrears are covered, Macedonia will be eligible for up to
Dollars 140m in fresh loans for infrastructure projects.
The best way to revive trade and eventually attract investment, the
government says, is to bypass both Greece and Serbia, and build new
communications links with Albania, Bulgaria and Turkey.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Super dinar fails to deliver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Serb-led Yugoslavia yesterday introduced a new currency - the 'super dinar'
 -as part of a package of economic measures aimed at stopping hyperinflation
and rebuilding the monetary system.
The Yugoslav government, in an attempt to restore confidence, claimed the
new dinar would be fully convertible, and backed up by DM500m (Pounds
195.3m) in hard currency and gold reserves. It would be pegged at a rate of
one German D-Mark.
However, yesterday inhabitants of Belgrade waited in vain for the new
banknotes to arrive in the Serbian capital. The payment of pensions was
postponed. There was scant hope of converting dinars into hard currency
after reports that the procedure would be complicated and take days.
Shopkeepers closed their doors, grappling with the complicated task of
introducing two accounting systems.
The economy of the rump Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has been
devastated after 20 months of United Nations sanctions, nearly three years
of war and the collapse of trade between the former Yugoslav republics.
Inflation ran at 1m per cent for December alone. Industrial production has
dropped by about 60 per cent in relation to three years ago. Almost half the
2.4m non-agricultural labour force is without jobs. The average monthly wage
last year fell to DM10 from DM550 in 1990.
Last autumn, with inflation in the trillions, the government slashed 15
zeros off bank notes in a bid to keep the dinar in use.
Old dinars, which yesterday were trading at 13m for one new dinar, will
remain in circulation.
But D-Marks have virtually replaced the national currency, and 'markici',
the Serbian nickname for pfennigs, are likely to remain the most treasured
commodity.
Belgrade economists said the government's reform programme failed to tackle
the economy's main problems, such as the need to cut public spending,
subsidies and military spending. Instead it relies on steep tax rises,
especially in the tiny private sector, to raise money for the empty state
coffers.
The programme will levy a range of new taxes on businesses, which some
companies, already hit by UN sanctions, fear will drive them out of
business.
Mr Jurij Bajec, an economics professor at Belgrade University, cautioned:
'This programme has a chance if the government takes it very seriously and
acts very responsibly.'
Mr Danijel Cvjeticanin, an economics professor, said Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic was afraid to shut loss-making factories. 'Most workers
are idle but are still paid. The state will now be forced to pay social
benefits rather than individual businesses.'

FT  25 JAN 94 / French consumer spending stays flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile nature of France's economic recovery was underlined yesterday by
the release of statistics which showed flat consumer spending on
manufactured goods in December.
The weak performance in December meant that fourth-quarter spending on
manufactured goods contracted by 2.1 per cent compared with the
July-September period, undermining hopes of a revival in demand. The
statistics also raised fears of a fall in overall gross domestic product.
'The results for December were surprisingly weak,' said Mr Jean-Francois
Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros. 'They show that consumers are still very
cautious in the face of rising unemployment and falling incomes.'
In addition to the uncertain economic outlook, the weak consumer spending
figures were blamed on the effect of increases in certain taxes. Duties on
petrol and alcohol were raised, as were social security payments. 'Part of
the fall in fourth-quarter spending probably reflected the delayed impact of
these measures,' said one economist.
Concerns about rising unemployment, which is currently in excess of 3.2m,
and about the sluggish state of demand, has prompted the government to
consider further measures. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has held
a series of meetings with business leaders and economic officials to discuss
what action might be taken.

FT  25 JAN 94 / EU enlargement pessimism: Negotiations by four newcomers set
to miss March deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations to bring Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway into the European
Union now look unlikely to be completed by the March 1 deadline required for
the enlargement to take place as planned in January next year.
With five weeks to go, progress on crunch issues like agricultural subsidies
is slowing down, negotiators on both sides acknowledge. Moreover, opinion
inside the European parliament, which has to approve the accession treaties,
is hardening against 'fast-track' ratification.
Because of elections to the parliament in June, the Strasbourg assembly has
set March 10 as the last date by which MEPs can examine enlargement, in time
for referendums in each of the four countries later this year.
Senior EU officials now believe that it may be possible to reach an outline
agreement next month on the main outstanding issues. But one official
admitted that 'there is no majority in the (European) parliament for the
fast-track' in the negotiations.
If Strasbourg insists on waiting for completed treaties, the official said,
membership for Austria, Sweden and Finland could be delayed to mid-1995, and
for Norway, which has the most obstacles to overcome, until January 1996.
There is nothing in EU law which requires Strasbourg to wait for completed
texts before starting ratification, officials say. But with MEPs clearly in
the mood to use the new muscle they acquired from the Maastricht treaty,
they are reluctant to be seen rubber-stamping 'headline' agreements reached
by the council of ministers of the Twelve.
Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of Socialist MEPs, the largest bloc at
Strasbourg, wrote last week in the Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter that
parliament's approval was not realistic before September, 'even if the
negotiations are concluded by March 1994'.
A more hopeful EU diplomat pointed to the achievement of reaching last
December's deadline to conclude the Uruguay Round, seen as improbable only
weeks beforehand.
'If we get this on to a Gatt plane, and everyone moves up an extra gear,
then maybe,' he said. Less sanguine Brussels diplomats point to the sequence
of missed Gatt deadlines; the four deadlines required before the European
Economic Area, grouping the Twelve and the applicants in a free trade zone,
came into effect this month; and the missed deadlines and extra European
summits needed to conclude previous enlargements in 1973, 1981 and 1986.
The current Greek presidency of the EU is prepared to call a special summit
next month if success looks likely.
But negotiations at senior level last Friday failed to yield hoped-for
breakthroughs.
Norway, moreover, raised the stakes by saying in writing that it cannot
accept EU objections to its hunting of whales and seal pups - an emotive
issue clouding already complicated negotiations with Oslo over farming,
fisheries and oil and gas exploration rights.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Britain unites German parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Left and right have joined forces across the German political spectrum in a
bid to abolish one of the few things which actually unites them - the
British budget rebate from the European Union.
The painful subject of the British rebate, successfully but bitterly
negotiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, re-emerged yesterday
as a German election issue when the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD)
called for its cancellation. With all the political parties gearing up for a
tough European election campaign, followed by a full-scale general election,
the whole question of Germany's own soaring net contributions to the EU
budget looks like emerging as a main theme.
Bonn's failure to negotiate its own budget 'abatement', or at least an end
to the British deal, is now under attack from left and right.
Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, said
it was no longer justifiable for Germany to be paying DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m)
a year extra to Brussels in order to reduce UK contributions.
Germany's own net contribution is expected to total DM23.4bn for 1993,
including the extra payment for the British. It has risen sharply over the
past six years, from DM10.3bn in 1987, to a forecast DM25bn next year.
The demand for a renegotiation has also been made by the conservative
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Mr Thomas Goppel, the CSU European affairs minister for Bavaria, has called
for either a new German rebate, or for abolition of the British rebate.
The irony is that the CSU is led by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, and therefore the man most responsible for negotiating Bonn's EU
budget relations. He is now under pressure both from his own party, and the
SPD opposition, because of his failure to win a better deal in Brussels.

The former chairman of the Efim state holding corporation, Mr Gaetano
Mancini, has been arrested on charges of false accounting and fraud. Italian
police are also seeking the former chairman of Efim's Alumix aluminium
subsidiary, Mr Corrado Innocenti.
The charges relate to consultancy fees paid when Efim's aluminium sector was
restructured at the end of the 1980s. Investigators are examining
allegations that fees in a L5.3bn (Pounds 2m) contract awarded to the
Moberis consultancy firm were swollen to provide L1.5bn in kickbacks.
Mr Mancini, 70, was the last chairman at Efim, whose large losses and heavy
indebtedness underlay the government's decision in July 1992 that it should
be placed in liquidation.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Chirac refuses to lead conservative Euro-fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's conservative coalition has been forced to continue its search for
someone to lead its campaign into this June's European parliament elections
following the refusal by Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR leader, to do
so.
Mr Chirac's refusal was couched in terms which made clear his determination
to challenge any attempt by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, for the
presidency in 1995. 'The constraints' of the Euro-election campaign would be
'a distraction', Mr Chirac said, from his goal of planning 'the big reforms
of our time'.
In fact, it was Mr Chirac's own aides who fuelled recent speculation that he
might head a joint ticket of the Gaullists and the UDF centre-right, perhaps
as a way of reminding the French electorate of the mayor of Paris's
existence.
For Euro-elections, French parties present national lists, often headed by
notables who on election immediately pass their Strasbourg seats to
underlings. In the end, Mr Chirac appears to have calculated that the risk
of doing badly in the Euro-elections, which voters see as an opportunity to
discomfit the government, outweighed his acute need for publicity.
To preserve his government's unity and his own poll standing, Mr Balladur is
urging RPR-UDF unity in the Euro-elections. But Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
the UDF leader, insists the two parties must share what he calls 'the three
unities' - a single programme, a single list of candidates and a single
parliamentary group in Strasbourg. This would involve the RPR joining the
UDF in the Christian Democrat group in the parliament.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK seeks role in European defence plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has invited the French and German defence ministers for a discreet
meeting tomorrow to discuss European military plans in the wake of the Nato
summit a fortnight ago.
The unprecedented trilateral meeting, which will be hosted Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, UK defence secretary, is indicative of a shift in the British
government's attitude towards European initiatives in defence.
The UK is now anxious to play a central role in plans to develop the Western
European Union (WEU) as the EU's defence arm, capable of deploying its own
forces for peacekeeping and other duties outside the Nato area.
Defence officials in Bonn described the talks, which are due to be attended
by Mr Volker Ruhe for Germany and Mr Francois Leotard for France, as an
'informal working meeting'.
The British government is concerned about the formation of a Franco-German
axis at the heart of European defence plans, and wants to use the meeting to
ensure it is not left on the sidelines.
This marks a sharp change since arguments two years ago about Franco-German
plans for a joint army corps.
Britain saw the corps, which is now due to include units from Belgium and
Spain, as threatening to undermine Nato.
British and US concerns have since been allayed by arrangements ensuring
that the troops could come under Nato command in a crisis. The Nato summit
highlighted the Clinton administration's support for a strong 'European
pillar' in the alliance, with less reliance being placed on US forces.
The ministers are expected to discuss US-inspired proposals for Combined
Joint Task Forces, designed to enable either Nato or the WEU to deploy
troops in response to emergencies such as Bosnia.
France, although it keeps its forces separate from Nato's command structure,
is due to participate fully in the plans.
These will involve special new headquarters arrangements at key Nato
commands.
Allies are also keen to ensure that Germany plays a full role, despite its
present constitutional difficulties over the sending of troops overseas.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Major braced for attacks on state pay freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was bracing itself last night for a fresh challenge to its
planned freeze on the public-sector pay bill as Labour's success in forcing
it on to the defensive over taxation provoked alarm among Conservative MPs.
Downing Street has confirmed that Mr John Major, the prime minister, has
received the first of the reports of the independent pay review bodies whose
recommendations cover about 1.5m public sector workers.
The first reports cover doctors, dentists and nurses and will be followed in
the next few weeks by several others, covering such groups as teachers and
the army.
The conclusions remain confidential but the speculation at Westminster last
night was that the review bodies would defy the Treasury's call for any pay
increases to be financed entirely from higher productivity.
Instead, the bodies may seek increases close to the 2.7 per cent that MPs
have voted for themselves. The case for such increases will be strengthened
by the government's admission at the weekend that the tax bill of the
average family will rise by Pounds 12.50 a week from April.
Mr Kenneth Clarke defended the need for tax rises again yesterday in the
face of a sustained attack from the opposition after the Treasury's
admission that the overall tax burden would soon be higher than at any point
under the last Labour government.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, produced another sheaf of official
figures to reinforce the opposition claim that the admission had destroyed
the Conservatives' claim to be the party of low taxation.
On the eve of today's House of Commons debate on the finance bill, Mr Clarke
said action to reduce public borrowing was essential to sustain the
recovery.
Few, if any, Tory MPs are likely to back a Labour move during today's debate
to force the government to drop the imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel.
But the strength of Labour's attack on the government's tax record was
reflected in a series of public demands from Tory backbench MPs for the tax
increases to be reversed before the general election due by 1997.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, echoed
the mood among his colleagues when he warned that the government would pay a
heavy penalty unless taxes were cut before the election.
Labour produced figures compiled by the Commons library showing that the
average family with a mortgage would see 10.7 per cent of their income taken
in income tax in the financial year beginning in April. This compares to 9.6
per cent during 1978-79, the final year of the last Labour government. When
national insurance was included, the proportion handed over to the Treasury
had risen from 16.1 per cent to 19.5 per cent.
Mr Brown accused the government of setting in place a 'five-year plan' of
tax increases, with the burden of taxation projected to rise to 38.5 per
cent by 1998-99. That compared with the high-point of 36.75 per cent during
the last Labour government.

FT  25 JAN 94 / CBI survey affirms steady economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy is improving steadily with few signs of an upsurge in
inflation, according to yesterday's Confederation of British Industry's
quarterly industrial trends survey. The survey endorses recent official data
showing a pick-up in output and contradicts more gloomy reports, notably
last week's survey by the British Chambers of Commerce.
Positive trends found by the CBI include improved business confidence, an
increase in manufacturing orders and output, and the first sign of an
increase in investment in plant and machinery since July 1989.
There appears to be continued downward pressure on costs, with more
manufacturers expecting to cut costs than at any time since the first survey
in 1958.
However, the CBI said it had two main areas of concern about the UK's
economic prospects in 1994. The first was the tax increases and government
expenditure cuts which 'will remove a significant proportion of purchasing
power from the economy'. The second was the recent appreciation of the pound
'which may well hold back export growth'.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said 'the
survey alone would not indicate a need to relax monetary policy further'.
But in view of 'the shadow of those tax increases', he thought it would be
'necessary and desirable to reduce interest rates'.
Business confidence increased for the fifth quarter in succession, according
to the survey. The number of firms which were more optimistic about business
in general exceeded those which were less optimistic by 27 per cent. This
balance, which indicates the trend, compares with plus 1 per cent in
October.
Optimism has been fuelled by an increase in output and orders. The balance
of companies reporting an increase in manufacturing output was the highest
quarterly figure since July 1989.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Channel rail route finalised: Planning blight removed for
hundreds - Project opened to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final route of the long-delayed fast rail link between London and the
Channel tunnel was announced yesterday.
The decision will remove planning blight from hundreds of homes and clear
the way for the government to bring in private sector partners.
The Pounds 2.6bn project has been dogged by delays and route changes for
nearly a decade and is not expected to be completed before 2002 - eight
years after the opening of the tunnel itself and nine years after the
completion of fast rail links on the French side of the Channel.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, confirmed that the government would
provide more funds for the project than had been expected, but said the
exact amount would depend on negotiations with the private sector.
Completion of the fast link into London will cut more than 30 minutes off
journey times and relieve pressure on the crowded commuter rail networks in
the south-east of England.
Two small sections of the route have still to be finalised, but the
government can now start preparing legislation.
The main decisions announced by Mr MacGregor were:
The choice of St Pancras rather than King's Cross as the north London
terminal.
A two-mile extension to a planned tunnel running into Islington in central
London to spare hundreds of homes from demolition or high levels of noise.
Two extra short tunnel sections in Kent to spare villages from disruption.
However, no final decision has yet been taken on the line of the route at
Ashford and at Gravesend in Kent, while the site of an intermediate station
has also been left to the private developers who will part-finance the line.
Three possible sites have been identified at Ebbsfleet in Kent, Rainham in
Essex and Stratford in east London.
At most, 40 homes would need to be demolished or acquired to make way for
the route, Mr MacGregor said, although more may be affected by increased
levels of noise.
The government plans to have legislation authorising the line ready by
autumn, but is resigned to a two-year battle to get it past parliamentary
oppos-ition.
Ministers drew comfort nevertheless from the muted response of Kent's
Conservative MPs, in sharp contrast to the savage criticism that followed
the announcement of the proposed line in 1986.
Mr Andrew Rowe, Conservative MP for Mid Kent, said: 'My constituents have
already lived in blight for five years; they are very likely to live in
blight for another 10 years.'
Kent County Council, which is in favour of the project, said it was
nevertheless disappointed that two sections were still not finalised and
said it would continue to fight for environmental improvements.
Ove Arup, an engineering consultancy involved in work on the route, said it
hoped to join the consortium that builds the link, either in a lead role or
as a junior member.

FT  25 JAN 94 / Consortium edges nearer to bid for Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium put together by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of
The Independent newspaper, yesterday edged closer to making a bid for
Newspaper Publishing, the company that publishes The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday.
The consortium said it was considering making an offer for the 52.9 per cent
of the company held by institutional shareholders and not already controlled
by its members.
The move came after Mirror Group Newspapers - a member of the consortium -
confirmed it was ready to take 40 per cent of the loss-making company. The
consortium also includes the founders of The Independent and the two largest
existing shareholders, the Spanish and Italian newspaper groups El Pas and
La Republica.
Detailed discussions on the price of any such deal are likely to start
immediately as pressure is mounting for an early resolution of the
struggling group's future.
Noting the announcement, Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper
Publishing, said a committee of non-executive directors would consider the
proposal. It would also discuss with the consortium the proposed terms.
It is believed that potential rival bidders, such as Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspapers of Ireland, are waiting to see what the Whittam
Smith-MGN consortium proposes before making a counter-offer.
However, it now appears that Mr O'Reilly might have to make a full bid for
the company if he wants to block a consortium bid. The members of the
consortium have signed undertakings that no one else can come in unless all
agree.
Mr Hay Davison said the board committee would 'assess the alternatives
available to Newspaper Publishing on their merits'.
Further delay is likely, however. It is unlikely that any alternative bids
for the company will be put before this Thursday's routine monthly board
meeting.
Mr Whittam Smith expressed delight at the consortium agreement. He said it
meant 'our editorial independence will be assured and we will be able to
reduce our costs with increased investment in The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday.' MGN has said it will renounce the right to vote on
the hiring and firing of editors.
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, conceded that Newspaper
Publishing would not be a goldmine, but said it represented a good long-term
investment that would take the popular newspaper group into a different
sector of the market.
At The Independent, journalists rejected the proposed deal with MGN as
incompatible with the editorial independence of the titles. The National
Union of Journalists chapel (branch) resolution also questioned whether Mr
Montgomery was a suitable person to be involved with The Independent.
Once a formal bid is made, the issue will have to be considered under
monopolies legislation. A reference to the Monopolies Commission is
automatic for newspaper deals involving combined circulations of 300,000
unless the life of a paper is threatened.

FT  25 JAN 94 / UK renews export cover to Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government yesterday renewed export insurance cover to Lebanon
for the first time since 1977.
The announcement coincided with an hour-long meeting in London yesterday
between Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Rafik Hariri, his Lebanese
counterpart. It signals increasing international confidence in returning
political and commercial stability following the end of the 1975-90 civil
war.
British ministers hope the move will make it easier for UK companies to bid
for some of the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of work to rebuild Beirut. The
initial credit facility is understood to be for Pounds 50m.
Premiums will depend on what assessment officials make of the risk of
operating in Lebanon.
Mr Richard Needham, British trade minister, said yesterday: 'The British
Export Credits Guarantee Department is one of the first export credit
agencies to go back on cover following the cessation of hostilities.'
British officials believe that French authorities have also provided an
export credit facility and that Italy has signed a trade protocol with
Lebanon.

FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: IMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of IMI offers a rare chance to buy shares in a financial
institution which has managed to accumulate capital rather than fritter it
away. Its caution in corporate lending in Italy has led to steady erosion of
market share but contributed to unusually stable profits. IMI has also
avoided more than token exposure to recent corporate failures - such as
Ferruzzi and Efim - which have blighted some of its peers. With a BIS
capital ratio of over 20 per cent, though, IMI looks overcapitalised.
Since it has no branch network and is dependent on wholesale markets, a
strong balance sheet and good credit rating contribute to a lower cost of
funds. The concentration of loans to a handful of groups, albeit
state-owned, also argues for a strong capital base. As the privatisation
programme continues, many of these loans will anyway lose their government
guarantees, so the ratio will tend to fall. Even so, investors might wonder
whether a capital ratio twice that of broadly comparable institutions, such
as Credit Locale of France, is really necessary.
This embarrassment of riches leaves IMI well placed to regain market share
in corporate banking as the Italian economy turns. But its real ambitions
lie elsewhere. Fund management, mutual funds and life insurance are already
producing good profits. If IMI can successfully manage the transition from
corporate bank to fully-fledged financial services group without recourse to
shareholders, its cautious approach to lending will not have been in vain.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Investment in Britain rises tenfold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian investment in Britain has risen more than tenfold, to almost
ADollars 16bn (Dollars 11bn) since Australia lifted exchange controls a
decade ago.
This makes Britain the biggest single offshore home for Australian
investment. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, 'Australia
sends about 35 per cent of its offshore direct investment to Britain, which
is eight times more than could be expected from the size of the UK economy.'
Australia is the fourth largest overseas investor in the UK.
The report also finds Britain is the second largest investor in Australia,
although only 7 per cent of its offshore direct investment goes in this
direction.
The strength of investment ties is surprising, given the shift in Australian
trade flows towards Asia and Britain's, toward Europe. Around 60 per cent of
Australia's trade is now conducted with Asia, while around 56 per cent of
British exports go to the European Union countries.
The report points out that the wave of Australian investment in Britain over
the past decade is largely accounted for by 16 companies - among them, Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Australian Mutual Provident Society,
which owns the Pearl and London Life insurance companies, and Foster's, the
brewing company which takes in Courage.
But it contradicts the widespread impression that much of this investment
took place occured in the mid- to late-1980s, when the last wave of
Australian entrepreneurs was at full power. The report says some ADollars
6.5bn was invested over the past five years, and cites a number of companies
 -such as Amcor, the paper and packaging group - which has made an initial
investment in the UK, as the first step to a European operation.
The report suggests a range of reasons for Australia's investment interest
in the UK, including cultural, regulatory and language similarities, and the
opportunity for expansion into other European markets.
It also says that some expansion-minded companies felt more comfortable
operating in the UK than in the highly competitive US environment. 'One
Australian manufacturing company commented that in Britain if you can be the
low cost/best quality producer you will win market share, but in the US you
may just bleed red ink as competitors keep down prices to hold market
share.'

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Governor Chris Patten's chances of getting the so-called non-controversial
parts of his democracy legislation through Hong Kong's legislature narrowed
at the weekend when the Legislative Council's biggest political party said
it would seek to amend his plans.
The Liberal party, a 15-member coalition of conservative politicians in the
60-strong council, said that in the interests of getting Britain and China
back to the negotiating table it would propose deleting all reference to
next year's Legco polls from a bill working its way through the council. But
it would support the governor's proposals for forthcoming local government
elections.
If the Liberals' amendment succeeds Mr Patten would be placed in a virtually
untenable position. One of the reasons talks between Britain and China broke
down late last year was the UK refusal to consider the colony's local
government elections separately from those for Legco.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Clinton backs California over tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Justice Department has kept President Bill Clinton's campaign promise
to California by backing the state in its 16-year-old tax case against
Barclays Bank of the UK.
In a brief filed last week with the Supreme Court, Mr Drew Days, the
solicitor general, argues that even if the US federal government has since
objected to California's unitary system of taxation, in 1977, when the
Barclays dispute began, it had merely expressed a preference for the
internationally recognised arm's-length tax method - not enough to throw out
the unitary method on constitutional grounds.
If California were to lose the case, it would have to pay around Dollars
400m of refunds to Barclays and other foreign-owned companies which have
disputed their unitary tax assessments. It could face another Dollars 1.3bn
of refunds in a related case brought by Colgate-Palmolive, the household
products group, involving US-based multinationals.
California would also lose another Dollars 2.4bn of taxes it has claimed but
not yet collected under the unitary method, in which companies may be asked
to pay taxes on a percentage of their parent group's worldwide income,
rather than only on income they have earned in California.
The Justice Department opinion is particularly important because the case
against the unitary method hinges on the constitutional argument that it
interferes with the federal government's powers over foreign trade.
As a fallback position, Mr Days argues that even if the Supreme Court
decided in favour of Barclays, it should dismiss Colgate's claim; and even
if it ruled against California in both cases, it should not order refunds,
as it has already changed its tax law in a way that meets the complaints
made against the unitary method by foreign governments.
Previous administrations have argued strongly against California but Mr
Clinton had promised to back the state if elected.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Czechs opt for early payout on state shares: A look at the
rush to sell privatisation vouchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An offer of immediate cash is enticing thousands of Czechs to part with
their privatisation voucher books now rather than wait for shares later in
the Czech Republic's second wave of mass privatisation.
The offer made by Epic, a Vienna-based consultancy and fund management
company, has attracted great interest and publicity, with hundreds of people
lining up outside offices in Prague and other Czech cities to sell their
voucher books.
'We've had people queuing overnight. It's been a tremendous success,' says
Mr Peter Goldscheider, Epic managing director.
Competition for subscribers between investment funds has been particularly
fierce with an estimated Kcs1bn (Dollars 35m) spent on advertising - roughly
five times the amount spent by funds in the first wave of privatisation two
years ago. In 1992 many funds tried to outbid one another with promises to
buy portfolios from investors at some future date for several times the
Kcs1,000 cost of their original voucher book. This assured investors a
risk-free profit on a relatively modest outlay, and encouraged massive
participation in the scheme.
About 6m Czechs bought voucher books, and the funds gained control of more
than 70 per cent of privatised companies' shares.
Epic has gone one step further by simply offering an immediate Kcs7,000 to
buy an investor's voucher book, with another Kcs1,000 paid later when the
shares are issued. 'We're not making any promises or offering people loans
as an incentive.
'We just cash out,' says Mr Goldscheider.
Analysts say Epic's offer is likely to be well below the future market value
of the privatised shares, but for many people it has the merit of simplicity
as well as providing immediate cash.
Mr Goldscheider will not say how many voucher books the company has bought
so far, or how long the offer will remain in force. 'We have a target, and
we'll stop when we reach it. We don't want to be too small or too big as
this reduces flexibility,' he says.
In the first wave, Epic attracted 110,000 investors with shares in about 60
companies to its Czech Coupon Invest fund, but it did not buy the shares
outright.
Interest in Epic's scheme has been especially strong among the elderly and
the less well-off - those who have benefited least from the past four years'
rapid transition to capitalism.
'Old people and people from the poorer regions tend to want to sell,' he
says. But they are not the only ones.
Epic's payment represents more than one month's average salary, and many
voucher book holders prefer to have the extra cash now rather than wait
until the shares are distributed. Others with shares from the first
privatisations have found it difficult to sell them, or they are still
waiting to receive money promised by funds almost two years ago. Many
investors complain they have not received any dividends on their shares.
Epic has taken on extra staff to answer phone calls and handle transactions
across the country at offices temporarily rented from Cedok, the Czech
travel agency. 'We have to move solicitors around the country to witness and
register every contract. Our people are working day and night in three
shifts just to process all this,' Mr Goldscheider says.
Unlike individual investors, investment funds can afford to wait in the
knowledge that they should easily recoup the costs of their investment. The
average value of shares secured with a Kcs1,000 voucher book in the first
privatisation wave is now Kcs20,000-Kcs30,000.
Even after deducting Kcs8,000 for each voucher book, plus the costs of
advertising and processing the transactions, Epic should not lose money.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): US oil sector - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tumble in the oil price late last year is unlikely to make much of a
dent in the earnings of the big US-based integrated oil and gas groups when
they report fourth-quarter figures this week. Cheaper oil will boost profit
margins in their refining and service station businesses - in some cases
more than offsetting lower earnings upstream in exploration and production.
Bouyed by this, and the prospect of benefits from cuts in costs, Mr Paul
Ting of Oppenheimer in New York has raised his fourth-quarter earnings
estimates for a number of the majors: Amoco to 83 cents a share, Chevron to
Dollars 1.60 a share, Exxon to 96 cents a share, Mobil to Dollars 1.40 a
share and Texaco to 87 cents a share.

MONDAY 24
Japanese coalition crisis
Members of Japan's ruling coalition meet the opposition Liberal Democratic
party in an attempt to revive the political reform bill, crippled by a
defeat in the upper house of parliament on Friday. Prime minister Morihiro
Hosokawa hopes to persuade the LDP to form a joint panel of the upper and
lower houses of parliament to agree to a watered down version of his four
reform bills. He has given himself until the end of the parliamentary
session on January 29 to get the bills through.
Mr Hosokawa said he would still attend the US-Japan summit in Washington on
February 11, to conclude talks on opening Japan's market to imports. Three
Japanese vice-ministers meet their US counterparts in Washington today for
critical talks on the bilateral 'framework' trade agreement.
Patten seeks approval
Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, attends a meeting of the British
Cabinet's Hong Kong sub-committee. The governor is expected to seek approval
to push ahead with his democracy proposals in the form of a second bill to
be put to Hong Kong's legislature in March.
US-China talks
US secretary of state Warren Christopher meets Chinese foreign minister Qian
Qichen in Paris. They will follow up treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen's
talks in Beijing last week. The US has said China's human rights record must
improve if it is to retain its most favoured nation trading status.
Council of Europe
The Council of Europe holds its winter parliamentary assembly from Monday to
Friday in Strasbourg. The main topic is the conflict in former Yugoslavia.
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, speaks on Tuesday and Israeli prime
minister Yitzakh Rabin on Friday.
Delegations from the parliaments of the Council's 32 member states will also
debate plans for new applicants after receiving applications from Russia,
Ukraine, Albania, Belarus, Croatia, Latvia, the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia, and Moldova. Entry depends on candidates passing the test of free
and fair elections and showing respect for human rights.
Greeks debate Macedonia
Andreas Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, opens a debate in parliament on
the dispute with the neighbouring former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over
its choice of name.
Papandreou shifted his position last week, saying Greece would be willing to
hold direct talks with Macedonia under UN sponsorship. Greece accuses
Macedonia of harbouring territorial claims against the northern Greek
province of Macedonia.
Lebanese PM
Lebanese PM Rafiq al-Hariri is due to start a three-day official visit to
London. He will hold talks with John Major, the prime minister, and Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary.
TUESDAY 25
Clinton's state of the union
US Congress reconvenes after its winter break. In the evening, it will hear
President Bill Clinton's second state of the union address. Clinton,
troubled by Whitewater investigations, but rising to new highs in opinion
polls, will lay out in his televised speech a heavy domestic legislative
programme. It will be topped by healthcare reform, but also includes
anti-crime initiatives, welfare reform and worker retraining.
Algerian reconciliation
The ruling High Council has called a 'national conference of reconciliation'
in Algiers to try to end an increasingly bloody conflict which has left more
than 3,000 dead. The Council has been running the country since the
cancellation in January 1992 of elections that the now-banned Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. Most opposition groups will boycott
the conference.
French Communist conference
The main task at the party's 28th congress (to Jan 29) is to chose a
successor to chairman Georges Marchais, 73. The veteran hardliner, is to
step down after 22 years. Who replaces him will be critical in determining
whether the ailing party will become a force in French politics again.
Banesto rescue
The Governor of the Bank of Spain meets the presidents of Spain's big banks
to discuss financing a rescue of Banesto, the bank whose board was sacked by
the Central Bank on December 28.
Portuguese strike
Portuguese civil servants, doctors and teachers have called a national
one-day strike in protest at proposals by prime minister Anibal Cavaco
Silva's centre-right government to limit 1994 public administrative sector
pay rises to 2 per cent. Transport workers also plan stoppages.
Union ban anniversary
Today is the 10th anniversary of the British government's ban on trade union
membership at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the
surveillance centre at Cheltenham. Unions plan a march and rally there on
Saturday.
Scott inquiry
British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd follows his predecessor Geoffrey
Howe, and prime minister John Major in giving evidence to the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry by Lord Justice Scott.
Burns Night
Scots of all nations will be marking the anniversary of the birth of
Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns in 1759, with generous helpings of
whisky and haggis.
WEDNESDAY 26
Irish budget Day
Bertie Ahern, finance minister (left), should have much more room for
manoeuvre in framing his budget than in previous years. He is favoured by
buoyant tax returns in 1993, promising growth prospects for 1994, and
additional receipts from privatisations. Mr Ahern is under pressure to
reduce income tax and employers' social insurance contributions. Specific
job-creation measures are also expected.
Southern African development
Ministers and officials from the 10-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) meet in the Botswanan capital, Gaborone, to discuss funding
with donors. On Thursday and Friday they discuss strategy.
SADC, whose members are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia, is at a crossroads. It
transformed itself 18 months ago from a co-ordinating conference into a
development community committed to closer economic integration. Its next
task is to formulate concrete strategies, especially on trade and
investment.
Delegates will also contemplate the economic implications of majority rule
in South Africa after April 27 and the likelihood that South Africa will
become its 11th member.
German economy
Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister (left), will present to the
cabinet his annual 1994 report on the state of the economy. The report is
expected to forecast growth of 1 to 1.5 per cent in gross domestic product
this year, an estimate more optimistic than that of independent analysts.
Holidays
Indian Republic Day (markets, banks and government offices closed). Chief
guest at the festivities is Singapore prime minister, Goh Chok Tong. India
hopes his visit will bring improved trade and investment relations with the
south-east Asian dragon economy.
Australia Day (markets closed).
FT Survey
FT Survey: Mobile Computing. Portables are more than an accessory for power
dressers, but they still lack sufficient battery power.
THURSDAY 27
Spanish general strike
Spain's two biggest trade unions hold a one-day national general strike in
protest at the Socialist government's plans to reform the labour market to
make it easier to hire and fire staff. Transport is likely to be badly hit
and stoppages will probably be widespread.
Bank of France meets
The newly independent Bank of France holds a council meeting to set the
bank's monetary policy targets for the current year.
Unfortunately, the meeting could not come at a more difficult time. France,
according to the Balladur government, is creeping out of recession, but
economic indicators for the past few months - and forecasts for the coming
year - are very mixed.
This will make the task of setting targets more than usually complicated.
Lithuanian president
Lithuanian president Algirdas Brazauskas is to meet European Commission
president Jacques Delors in Brussels. Lithuania will also sign up to Nato's
'partnership for peace' plan, becoming the first state in the former Soviet
bloc to do so. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has warned the west that
eastward expansion of the western defence alliance will only encourage a
nationalist backlash within Russia.
EIB results
The European Investment Bank publishes its results for 1993 and a review of
its current operations. Watch out for clues on how the fast-growing EIB
intends to follow up the European Union's agreement to invest more in a
trans-European networks in roads, rail and telecommunications.
Davos economic forum
Yassir Arafat, Shimon Peres, Helmut Kohl, Hans Tietmeyer, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Lee Kuan Yew, Benazir Bhutto, PV Narisimha Rao, Kenneth Clarke
and scores of other top politicians join hundreds of business leaders and
academics at the Swiss ski resort of Davos for a weekend of seminars with
the modest aim of 'redefining the basic assumptions of the world economy'
(to Jan 31).
The gathering, known as the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, also
enables the participants to indulge in skiing, public posturing, private
conspiring and general networking.
Social Trends
Social Trends, the annual compendium of British social statistics, is
published. It will focus on low-income households.
FT survey
FT survey: FT Exporter. Exporters across the globe now face brighter
prospects, following a year of feeble growth in the industrialised world.
FRIDAY 28
Vote on phone-tap scandal
Greece's parliament votes on whether former prime minister Constantine
Mitsotakis should be prosecuted by a special court on charges of ordering
illegal phone-taps of political rivals.
The debate comes as Mr Mitsotakis faces the possibility of another
embarrassing court case. The Culture Ministry has accused him of adding
artefacts looted from graves on Crete to his private collection of
antiquities.
Zambian budget
Finance minister Ronald Penza presents his 1994 budget against a deepening
crisis. Last year's budget promised tight controls on spending, big
reductions in the money supply, and 10 per cent inflation by the end of
1993. These targets have been missed, and austerity policies will have to
continue. Allegations of cabinet-level corruption have led to resignations
and dismissals, while donors are threatening to withhold aid unless Lusaka
cleans up its act.
Banco Latino
Banco Latino, Venezuela's second largest commercial bank, run by the
government after failing on January 14, re-opens to start repaying small
account holders up to USDollars 930 each.
WEEKEND 29-30
South African dissenters
On Saturday, the white right wing plans to announce a transitional authority
to rival the Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body managing
the country's transition to democracy.
The Zulu-based Inkatha party meets all weekend to decide whether to take
part in the all-race elections in April.
Referendums on Sunday
Kyrgyzstan holds a vote on presidential powers.  President Askar Akayev's
government recently resigned after a corruption scandal. The vote may also
test the IMF's credibility in the area, as Kyrgyzstan is the first Central
Asian republic to adopt its currency reform proposals.
Guatemalans vote on constitutional reforms
Guatemalans vote on constitutional reforms. These would bring forward
congressional elections, depoliticise supreme court appointments,
decentralise government spending, and reduce terms of office.
American Football
The Buffalo Bills play the Dallas Cowboys in the Super Bowl in Atlanta on
Sunday.

Monday: The Confederation of British Industry produces its quarterly
economic trends survey, a far-reaching report on manufacturing industry,
which should confirm that the improved pace of recovery continued into the
first quarter of this year. It should also show that price and cost
pressures remain subdued.
Tuesday: November construction and new order figures for the UK are
released. Recent figures have shown an improvement in the construction
market, and industry will watch today's figures to check that the gains have
been sustained.
Friday: US GDP is forecast to have risen an annualised 5.2 per cent in the
fourth quarter, while in the UK, non-European Union trade figures are
forecast to show another slim narrowing of the deficit. MP Nick Budgen'
private member's bill seeking greater autonomy for the Bank of England gets
a second reading.
France produces its visible trade balance figures for November. In October,
there was an impressive FFr8.7bn surplus, with the recession producing a
large fall in imports. Much the same picture is expected for November.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: A warning signal from Venezuela - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of Venezuela's second-largest commercial bank should raise
warning signals about the quality of Latin America's banks.
Many are raising funds in the international markets and still more are
paying high interest rates to secure foreign currency deposits; but there
are signs that investors are not adequately differentiating among different
institutions.
'There are a lot of second or third-tier Latin American banks having their
paper placed all over the world. The extent to which this risk is any good,
one doesn't know,' says Mr Paul Luke of Morgan Grenfell Debt Arbitrage and
Trading in London. 'It's unclear whether the market is adequately
differentiating between the different forms of risk.'
Mr Charles Prescott of the London-based bank credit analysis concern IBCA
says 55 banks from Brazil alone have issued debt in the inter-national
market without a credit rating.
Much of this debt has been placed directly into the hands of flight-capital
accounts held by individual Latin Americans, who are comfortable with the
risk they are taking. However, foreign investors without specialised local
knowledge are likely to demand more information than they are getting at
present.
Latin America's banking systems are a varied lot. Most are in a state of
flux, stemming in large part from the economic reforms which have changed
the nature of banking in much of the region. Institutions which once
survived by channeling money to the government and living off the wages of
inflation, have had to find private sector customers and have sometimes
proved inexpert at finding good risks.
As these upheavals take place, the practices which were common in Latin
banks in the past have not entirely died out. As in Venezuela, accounts are
sometimes not consolidated, allowing banks to shuffle assets from one
subsidiary to another to provide an optical illusion of a healthy bank. The
practice of making loans to executives or leading shareholders still goes
on.
Unhappily for the authorities, Venezuela's problems came in the very month
that new banking legislation, which would have dealt with some of these
practices as well as bolstering the capital of the banks, took effect.
In a bid to calm disquiet over the rest of the banking system, Venezuela's
government moved on Friday to relax monetary conditions in the banking
system in a bid to ease disquiet about other institutions. Mr Prescott
points out that the likelihood that a country's authorities will stand
behind a bank, while it may not provide much comfort to shareholders, is an
important element in analysing its credit risk.
The problems being faced by Venezuela now parallel in some respects the
difficulties faced by the Chilean and the Colombian banking systems during
the 1980s, when the government was forced to intervene to save some banks.
These banks are now emerging from these problems: legislation now before the
Chilean congress should resolve the remaining issue of subordinated debt
still owed to the government by banks in Chile.
In Colombia, the Banco de Colombia is also emerging from under the state
umbrella: it is undertaking an international placement of Dollars 220m
(Pounds 149m) in notes to be exchangeable into the bank's shares. Morgan
Grenfell and its Deutsche Bank parent are handling the issue - which will
account for around a third of the bank's capital.
In Mexico, the rapid privatisation of 18 banks and the expansion in the
economy led to a breakneck pace of loan growth. Now the economy has slowed
down, the loan quality of the banks deteriorated through much of 1993.
Trying to compensate for this, banks have kept high the interest rates they
have charged to customers, intensifying and possibly lengthening the
recession.
Elsewhere, worse may be yet to come. A report by two World Bank economists
in November suggested that many Brazilian banks were making hay out of
inflation (now touching 40 per cent a month) and that subduing inflation
'would threaten the solvency of some banks'.
Most bank analysts agree that a difficult period can be expected for
Brazilian banks once inflation is under control, before the banking system
eventually emerges healthier. This parallels the Argentine experience in
reducing inflation radically over the past three years.
The New York-based Thomson BankWatch says Argentina's 'regulatory
environment will continue to improve, with stricter capital requirements and
closer monitoring of the banks by the central bank.' Profitability, it adds,
'will remain above international norms'.
Nonetheless, in Argentina and elsewhere, it is hard for bank regulators to
keep up with the pace of change in the banking market. If it's hard for the
regulators, investors should tread warily.

TOKYO
The unexpected defeat of Prime Minister Morihiro's political reform bill in
the upper house last Friday is bad news for the stock market. The coalition
government will have to negotiate with the Liberal Democrats, the leading
opposition party, over a compromise. Share prices could plunge on
profit-taking if further political turmoil delays the announcement of the
economic stimulus package.
PARIS
Bouygues, the construction group, announces 1993 results tomorrow. The
company, which reported a 27 per cent reduction in first-half net profits,
has warned that full-year figures will be down on last year's FFr685m
(Dollars 117.29m). Skis Rossignol holds an analysts' meeting on Thursday and
BSN unveils 1993 sales figures on Friday.
WARSAW
Bank Slaski, the market's largest ever share listing, makes its trading
debut tomorrow. The bank, one of the nine being sold under the government's
privatisation programme, saw a massive oversubscription last month, with
more than 800,000 domestic and foreign applicants offering 7,993.2bn zlotys
(Dollars 372m) for 1,226.5bn zlotys worth of shares. Analysts expect the
500,000 zloty offer price to more than treble when trading begins.
DUBLIN
Investors are hoping for a mildly positive package from Wednesday's budget.
Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, which this month told analysts in London and
Edinburgh it expected domestic investors to replace foreigners as the
driving force in the market this year, believe the government may re-jig
investment tax treatment in favour of equity investors.
STOCKHOLM
SSAB, the steel company, is expected to announce 1993 net profits of around
SKr600m (Dollars 74m) tomorrow. Firmer prices and lower processing costs
have helped the recovery after 1992's SKr165 pre-tax loss.
ZURICH
Baer Holding is expected to unveil 1993 profit figures today. Tomorrow, the
Swiss Insurance Industry Association holds a news conference. Swiss Re has
analysts' presentations in Zurich tomorrow and in London on Wednesday.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: FRN investors offered a home on the range -
Risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have seen collared floating-rate notes, fixed-floater-fixed notes,
reverse and perpetual floaters. Now meet the latest structured product to
emerge from the laboratories of the Eurobond rocket scientists: the
range-floater.
In recent weeks this instrument has become all the rage, and hardly a day
passes without a handful of such deals hitting the Eurobond market. The past
two weeks have seen the issuance of more than Dollars 1bn of range-floaters,
also called corridor floaters, and syndicate officials say there's more to
come.
US dollar range-floaters essentially hinge on investors' outlook for US
interest rates. In order to make money, they have to hold the view that US
short-term rates will stay in a narrow band during the life of the note and
that interest-rate volatility will remain low.
The salient feature of range floaters is that, when the dollar London
inter-bank offered rate lies within a specific range, investors earn a much
higher coupon than they would otherwise receive on a plain-vanilla floater
from the same borrower. However, no interest accrues on the days when Libor
lies outside that range.
As an example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
last week issued Dollars 200m of one-year range notes. They pay a coupon of
three-month Libor plus 50 basis points when the three-month Libor daily
fixing falls between zero and 4 per cent in the first six months of the
note's life and between zero and 4.25 per cent during the second six months.
No interest accrues when Libor rises above 4 per cent during the first half
or above 4.25 per cent during the second half. US three-month Libor was
fixed at 3.25 per cent on Friday.
As a triple-A rated supranational borrower, the EBRD would pay well below
Libor on a plain-vanilla FRN. According to the EBRD's treasurer, Mr Rene
Karsenti, the deal beat its one-year funding target of around Libor minus
3/8 points.
Range floaters pay investors an above-market rate to compensate them for the
risk that interest may not accrue during some of its life.
'We are now in an environment where yields are so low that the only way to
get a yield pick-up is to take a market view,' says Mr Tim Skeet, senior
vice president on the syndication desk at Kidder, Peabody.
Many range-floaters have been issued by triple-A rated borrowers, making
credit risk a negligible consideration. Typical buyers of range-floaters
include money-market fund managers and commercial banks.
Even if Libor does fall outside the range during some of its life, it will
take a while before investors lose out. In the case of the EBRD note,
investors will earn the full Libor-plus-50 coupon if Libor lies within its
range on each day in the quarter; but even if Libor is within the range for
only 78 days, the investor will still earn around Libor flat - more than
could be obtained from a plain vanilla EBRD floater. 'Libor can fall outside
the corridor for a period of time and you can still have a good investment,'
says one dealer.
From the borrower's perspective, range floaters enable top-notch issuers to
get deep sub-Libor funding by swapping the proceeds into plain-vanilla
Libor-based funds.
'The value comes from the swap counterparty who agrees to pay the issuer the
difference between its sub-Libor funding target and the coupon on the days
when Libor is within the range,' explains a swaps trader. This leaves the
issuer fully hedged while the swap counterparty assumes the risk that Libor
stays within the range. The swap counterparty in turn can hedge itself with
the use of options strategies.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Search for value to continue - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stock market constantly searching for new peaks presents investors with a
heady environment, especially when it insists that all news must be good
news. The UK market is still riding strongly on base rate cut prospects and
the reality must be that the cut is not going to be delivered until the
chancellor of the exchequer wills it; he did not sound too willing on BBC
radio last week, so hopes must be projected forward yet again.
This week will leave the stock market relatively light on UK economic data
compared with last week. There are also fewer trading statements from the
big corporate names, except in the retail sector. This could be dangerous
because it leaves investors to continue the search for value in a market
where the word 'overbought' is becoming audible.
Plummeting yields on equities as prices race ahead have already brought the
dividend yield on the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index down to levels seen
only rarely over the past 20 years. With bond yields also declining fast,
investors have been driven to seek out 'value' in the higher yield areas in
equities, including, most notably, the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks.
This index, having outperformed the FT-SE 100 Share Index by almost 8 per
cent since January 1993, went into overdrive in the middle of last week,
outpacing and even leading the FT-SE 100 Share Index.
But any market index which can rise by 136 points on one day, and fall by 43
the day after, as the Mid 250 did in the middle of last week, is a hazard
for the unwary.
Fund managers are very cautious towards the non-Footsie stocks, remembering
how many relatively illiquid shares proved unsaleable for a long time after
the market crash of 1987.
Higher than average yields can highlight dividend risk as well as underlying
value, warns Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull.
Technical market specialists warn that market makers have been effectively
short of stock since the FT-SE Index stood at 3,050, just ahead of the
November budget.
Allowing for several catch-up opportunities since then, the genuine 'average
shorting level' is believed to be around 3,265 which leaves a lot of room
for market makers to welcome and encourage any correction in share prices.
Technical pressures of this nature can push prices downwards as well as
upwards if the market changes direction.
Derivative Securities, the UK-based specialist on equity market technical
factors, believes that, while a correction is still likely, only a few
stocks are in serious danger.
It identifies Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, as displaying clear
signs of being overbought following the response of the share prices to the
boardroom developments.
It rates as marginally overbought stocks ranging from British Airways, where
the shares are looking for higher traffic levels as global economies
improve, to Tesco, which last week commented on the trading outlook.

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN
Pakistani share prices were hit hard by yesterday's 'black Sunday' as the
Karachi Stock Exchange index, the KSE-100, fell by 129 points or almost 5
per cent of its value - the largest drop in a single day in recent history.
The heavy selling of shares, which came after a three month boom, was led by
the financial sector and some textile shares, stockbrokers said last night.
However, many brokers and market analysts were confident that the fall was a
temporary correction rather than indicative of a heavy selling trend.
'This was the reaction that everybody was waiting for,' said Mr Yasin
Lakhani, president of the Karachi Stock Exchange.
The KSE-100 index has risen by approximately 1,000 points, or roughly 70 per
cent, since the October elections won by Ms Benazir Bhutto.
HONG KONG
Hong Kong's stock exchange might extend trading hours to accommodate the
increased investor interest, Mr Paul Chow, the stock exchange's chief
executive, said in London last week. This would also mean that trade could
overlap with the London Stock Exchange's Seaq International trading system.
Professor Liu Hongru, chairman of China's Securities Regulatory Commission,
said at the same presentation that he was studying the possibility of
establishing a stock exchange in the north of China. This should introduce
more competition between the country's two other exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen.
LEBANON
Lebanon's stockbrokers have called for the reopening of the country's stock
market, closed since 1984. This move came as a secondary market was due to
be established to start trading next month in shares of Solidere, a company
that has been formed to rebuild central Beirut.
Central bank officials have said that the new market is a temporary measure
and that the Beirut bourse will eventually be reactivated.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: A bond issue with a twist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As new issues of Latin American bonds continued thick and fast last week,
the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais launched on Friday a Eurobond issue with
twist.
The issue - which Banque Indosuez, its arranger, says is the first sovereign
bond issue from Brazil since 1980 - carries warrants entitling holders to
buy preferred shares in the state-owned electricity company, Cemig.
The issuer is doubtless hoping to benefit from the current Brazilian 'rosy
scenario' which - for all the doubts about it coming to pass - has
apparently been driving the Brazilian stock market's remarkable rally this
month.
Under this, finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso succeeds in pushing
through an economic package which brings down inflation. This so adds to his
prestige that he wins this year's presidential election. He also manages to
close Brazil's debt deal with foreign banks by the deadline of April 15,
thereby improving Cemig's own debt profile.
Minas Gerais is issuing Dollars 200m of bonds, Dollars 100m with a five-year
maturity and Dollars 100m with a six-year maturity. The five-year bonds
carry a 7 7/8 per cent coupon and the six-year an 8 1/4 per cent coupon. The
conversion premium on the three-year warrants is 30 per cent over the
weighted average price of the preferred over the last month on the Sao Paulo
stock exchange.
The preferred shares are the eighth most liquid in Sao Paulo, and the
warrant offer represents about 5 per cent of outstanding shares. Cemig
generates about 8 per cent of Brazil's electricity.
Bombril, a household cleaning products manufacturer, placed Dollars 150m of
paper in August, in Brazil's first international equity warrants issue.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Earnings to remain the focus - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'nirvana scenario' embraced by Wall Street last week may quickly fall
out of fashion if the impressive new year rally comes to an abrupt halt this
week or next, as some analysts expect.
Be that as it may, simple faith in the staying power of the current
fundamentals - strong growth, low inflation and stable interest rates -
resulted in a nearly perfect string of sessions last week. Indeed, for a few
days at least, it has seemed like the best of all worlds for stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered past the 3,900 mark for the first
time on Friday, just two weeks after topping 3,800. The bellwether blue-chip
index finished at 3,914.48, for a weekly advance of 47 points and its fourth
record close in five days. (On Tuesday, the Dow was unchanged, matching the
peak achieved the previous session.)
With the US results season in full swing, earnings - rather than fresh
economic news and trends in the US Treasury bond markets - will remain the
focus, as investors look to see how individual companies performed.
Some leading pharmaceutical concerns, including Merck and Warner-Lambert,
will post their results today. The market, which has already reacted badly
to a slowdown at Pfizer, is anxious to see if price discounting has affected
the profitability of the rest of the underperforming sector.
The failure of the market last week to respond with enthusiasm to earnings
that matched or exceeded analysts' forecasts was a warning flag for Mr James
Solloway, head of equity research at Argus Research in New York. There were
some exceptions, notably Caterpillar and Apple Computer. But the market, by
and large, seems to have factored strong earnings into many share prices.
Mr Solloway believes this is a just one indication of 'the wear and tear
that develops near the end of a market rally', when stock values have begun
to run ahead of the fundamentals. While he believes the longer-term outlook
for equities remains bullish, he anticipates 'a couple of weeks of
consolidation' in the near term.
Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago, agrees
that the market is ripe for a setback, but believes it will put in a good
performance over the next few days. However, he warns that stocks are
approaching an 'overbought' position and expects the market to retrace its
December and January gains with a correction of about 10 per cent soon.
Just what will trigger the downward move is anyone's guess. Potential
catalysts include a further deterioration of the Russian reform process and
another uptick in industrial commodity prices.
Mr Joseph McAlinden, of Dillon Read in New York, points out that the
preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product, to be
released on Friday, may scare investors if it exceeds 5 per cent. Such a
level may bring forward a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary
policy.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: The Yen falls under the spotlight -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Yen appears likely to be a focus of attention this week with the weak
economy, political uncertainty, and an ongoing trade dispute with the US all
impacting on the cur-rency.
The market will be trying to assess the impact of the government's failure
last week to pass a political reform package. If this prevents the
introduction of a fiscal package aimed at stimulating the economy, this may
cause the Yen to weaken.
The outcome of yesterday's meeting between Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will also
be closely watched.
If progress is not made in curbing Japan's trade surplus with the US, the
Japanese unit will probably strengthen as an alternative means of closing
the gap.
The market will also be keeping a close eye on the release of fourth quarter
US GDP and durable goods figures. If these are as strong as predicted, this
should lend further strength to the US currency.
In Europe, a focus of attention will be Thursday's meeting of the Bank of
France monetary policy committee.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), argues
that good inflation figures and some worrying trade news, allied to D-Mark
weakness, give the Bank the opportunity to cut rates.
Were it to do so, following last week's Danish rate cuts, this would
represent an important decoupling of monetary policy by core ERM currencies
from the Bundesbank.
The outlook for sterling remains mixed as traders review the strength of the
UK economy. The market is likely to turn its attention today towards
investment in the CBI quarterly trends survey.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, argues that these should be
quite buoyant given the healthy state of returns on investment and tight
capacity constraints in the manufacturing sector. If they are not, this
would be an important signal to the government about the health of the
economy.

FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Danish rhetoric becomes reality -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Denmark's veteran central bank governor, must be singing
in his sauna. He is the toast of the financial markets following his success
in restoring confidence in the Danish krone, one of the main casualties of
the collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism last August, a feat
which has given him the freedom to cut Danish interest rates independently
of the German Bundesbank.
Indeed, the 69-year-old tree lover, who is due to retire at the end of this
year after 29 years at the helm of the central bank, has such confidence in
the krone's renewed stability that he said on television two weeks ago
Danish interest rates could drop as low as US levels - now around 3 per
cent.
His predictions, coupled with the rosy outlook for inflation and economic
growth in Denmark, had the same effect on the Danish government bond market
as waving a red flag in front of a bull.
According to Unibors Securities, yields on 10-year Danish government bonds
dropped 25 basis points to a record low of 5.89 per cent soon after Mr
Hoffmeyer's comments. At the same time, the yield differential between
German and Danish 10-year government bonds narrowed to less than 30 basis
points from 55 basis points two weeks earlier.
However, the market appears to have cold feet now Mr Hoffmeyer's rhetoric is
starting to become a reality. After last week's widely-expected
quarter-point cut in Denmark's discount rate to 5.75 per cent, which brought
it in line with Germany's discount rate, yields on 10-year Danish government
bonds widened to 6 per cent. In addition, the krone failed to strengthen
following the rate cut, breaking a trend to which the market had become
accustomed since the ERM collapse.
Mr Richard Gilhooly, international economist at Kidder Peabody in London,
points out that a further independent rate cut in Denmark could prompt
investors to switch into German government bonds, attracted by the higher
yield and greater currency stability.
Analysts at Unibors have also taken the view that the short-term limit for
the Danish bond market has been reached. 'Irrespective of the current
positive features of the Danish economy, most economic fundamentals point to
a widening of the Danish-German yield spread and not to a further
narrowing,' Unibors says in its latest weekly review of Scandinavian bond
markets.
They believe the Danish central bank will use any bouts of D-Mark weakness
to ease monetary policy further, which would push the Danish discount rate
through the German level. But they warn that this situation would be
reversed once the German economy showed signs of recovery, which would
strengthen the D-Mark's status as the anchor currency within the ERM.
Other analysts are confident there are more gains to be made in the Danish
bond market this year.
Mr Neil Williams, senior economist at Daiwa Europe in London, forecasts a
further cut of 150 basis points in the Danish discount rate by mid-year,
which would result in Danish government bond yields dropping below Germany's
by five to 10 basis points. 'Denmark is likely to be a rising star in the
first half of this year,' he says.
Mr Keld Holm, head of research at Bikuben Securities in Copenhagen, expects
the narrowing of the yield differential between Germany and Denmark to
stabilise at current levels in the short term but to narrow to about 25
basis points by mid-year.
Mr Holm is pinning his hopes on the Danish central bank's ability to
safeguard the krone's stability and to pursue its aggressive monetary
policy.
In light of Mr Hoffmeyer's recent comments, which suggest he might want to
have some fun in his final year, they could well come true.

Last week, the bund market was dispirited by the Bundesbank's decision to
leave short-term interest rates unchanged. This week, it is unlikely to take
cheer from two sets of data due in the next few days.
Baden-Wurttemberg and North-Rhine Westphalia, two of Germany's biggest
states, are expected to report inflation figures for January today or
tomorrow.
Other states report during the week and so it will be possible to get a
picture of German inflation for the month as a whole.
Last month pan-German inflation rose at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent.
Predictions for January range from 3.4 to 4 per cent, reflecting uncertainty
over the impact of higher indirect taxes on petrol.
A high outcome is likely to reinforce the Bundesbank's caution in bringing
the Lombard and discount rate down from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent respectively
where they have been since the end of October.
The second item of data will be the December growth in M3 broad money
supply. The Bundesbank has warned that the figure will probably be high but
confirmation of this will do nothing to cheer investors in the bund market.
In November, M3 grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent, well above the
upper limit of last year's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range.

Bond traders are bracing themselves for a volatile week. Government bond
prices are expected to fluctuate as a result of buying due to revived hopes
of an imminent rate cut and profit-taking on expectations of increased
supply.
Prospects of prolonged political turmoil stemming from last Friday's defeat
of the coalition government's political reform bill together with a further
delay to the announcement of an economic stimulus package, originally
expected this week, may support the No 157 10-year benchmark government
bond, which faced heavy selling last week.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has until this Saturday to reach a
compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party, the leading opposition.
The government's inability to take economic initiatives is likely to renew
expectations of a cut in the official discount rate.
Investors will focus on the central bank's branch managers' meeting, which
runs from today until the end of the week. The scheduled press conference by
Mr Yasushi Mieno, BoJ governor, is likely to provide further evidence of
economic weakness throughout the country.
Meanwhile, the 10-year bond auction on Wednesday might trigger concern over
increased supply, thus limiting a rally.

FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Euromarket spin-offs aid charities -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hefty profits earned by the underwriters of last year's bumper crop of
Eurobond issues - and the sizeable bonuses paid to many bankers - have left
market participants feeling more than usually flush.
Happily, car dealers and offshore fund managers have not been the sole
beneficiaries. In the last month, London's Eurobond syndication community
has spawned several imaginative schemes for raising money for charities.
Morgan Stanley launched an issue of zero-coupon perpetual charity bonds,
which has so far raised 'well over Pounds 100,000'. The bond structure is
simple: the investor buys a bond, in denominations of Pounds 1,000, Pounds
5,000 or Pounds 10,000, which does not pay interest and is never redeemed.
However, the investor does receive a bond certificate, and participating
institutions will be featured on 'tombstone' advertisements in the financial
press.
The money is channelled through The Charities Aid Foundation and distributed
to three charities, the Depaul Trust, which helps homeless young people, the
Samaritans, which offers comfort and support to people in need, and Relate
which advises couples and families in times of trouble.
'In the syndicate world, there is a very tight community, and all day long
we sit and price deals,' says Mr Michael Dee, head of Morgan Stanley's
syndicate desk. 'We wanted to put a positive spin on it.'
On December 7, Canadian-owned Wood Gundy donated all its trading and
syndicate profits from its London operation to Children in Crisis, which
helps the children of the former Yugoslavia. With staff contributions and
donations from clients, the firm raised Pounds 110,000.
The third scheme, dubbed Eurobonds in Action, is specifically designed to
thrive on the competitive nature of a market obsessed by league table
performance.
Participating banks have agreed to contribute a percentage of every bond
issue they arrange between the start of the year and Mardi Gras (February 4)
to Action Research, a charity which funds medical research.
For example, if a bank launches a Dollars 300m issue, it contributes 0.001
per cent of the value of that issue - in this case, Dollars 3,000 - to the
charity .
Mr Denys Firth, director of debt capital markets at SG Warburg, and his wife
Victoria, who is on the London fund raising committee of the charity,
persuaded 19 Eurobond houses to participate.
The market timing, always a prime concern for syndicate officials, could not
have been better. 'I doubt if there is any other time in the market when we
could have achieved this,' said Mr Firth.
Mr Firth's market instincts did not let him down: the flow of new Eurobond
issues, always heavy at the start of a new year, has already reached Dollars
50bn so far this month, and could set a new record.

Plotting the course of US economic growth these days demands a good
understanding of the effects of natural disasters. First there was last
summer's flooding in the mid-West, now an earthquake in southern California
and an arctic blast that last week froze much of the East. To what extent
are these events holding back - or in some cases stimulating - economic
activity?
Fourth-quarter GDP figures, to be released on Friday, will provide an
indication of just how robust economic growth was in the final months of
1993. The previous quarter was up 2.9 per cent from a year before -
restrained to some degree by the floods, but still a healthy bounce back
from the sharp slowdown in the first half of last year. That surge continued
into the last three months of the year, aided in part by the one-off effects
of a post-flood catch up in activity.
Expectations for fourth -quarter growth have been hastily revised upwards in
recent days, from the 4.8 per cent level which had been the market's
previous view. Now, estimates range from 5 to 6 per cent, reflecting strong
consumer spending growth and an upturn in residential construction. That the
fourth quarter figure would be strong has been long expected: whether the
bond market has fully priced in such a rise is another thing.

The main event of the week is likely to be the first auction of the year -
Wednesday's offer of Treasury 6 1/4 per cent 2010 stock. The size of the
issue - Pounds 2.75bn compared with a recent range of Pounds 3bn to Pounds
3.75bn - and the fact that the second part payment is not due until March
'suggests this year's funding programme is virtually complete', according to
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International
(Europe).
Mr Peter Fellner, gilts strategist at NatWest Markets, argues that the
smaller size of the auction indicates the Bank of England may prefer to
continue with regular monthly auctions rather than have larger, less regular
offers.
Last week's retail prices figures, which showed inflation slightly below
expectations, create a favourable background for the issue. Long gilt yields
fell by around 25 basis points on the week.
There is little economic news to influence the market this week, with only
today's CBI Industrial Trends survey and Friday's non-European Union trade
data. The next major event will be the Bank of England's inflation report on
February 8. In the interim, gilts may well be caught in the crossfire
between US Treasuries (where the next interest rate move is still expected
to be up) and German government bonds (where the next interest rate move is
expected to be down).

FT  24 JAN 94 / The Markets: Cloudy picture for US economy - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the events of the past week are anything to go by, US economists will
have to adjust the statistics for early 1994 not just for the effects of
earthquake, flood and freeze, but also for plagues of locusts and outbreaks
of boils.
We will know on Friday, when the advance GDP estimates are published, if the
US economy was really growing at 6 per cent in the closing months of 1993,
as the White House and the US Treasury have been predicting. But the
geological and meteorological events of recent weeks mean that we don't
really have much idea about what the numbers will be for the first quarter
of 1994.
Locust-adjusted, the US economy is probably still careering along. Mark
Turner, who runs Putnam Investments' global fixed income funds from Boston,
offers one of those anecdotes which are always far more compelling than the
dry statistics. When he started to renovate his house a few months ago, he
says, his builder had a so-so order book. Now, it's completely filled for
the next four years, with a mixture of residential and commercial work.
'Boston was first into the real-estate slump, and it will probably be the
first out,' says Mr Turner. That means you can't necessarily generalise to
other parts of the country. But still, the tale is another piece of evidence
about the scale of the US recovery.
In manufacturing, for example, we could well discover this spring - divine
afflictions permitting - that the US has enjoyed six months of industrial
output growing at an annual rate of over 10 per cent. General Electric,
perhaps the most diversified of big US companies, reported fourth-quarter
earnings from continuing businesses up 22 per cent over the same period the
year before.
Despite all this growth, there seems no sign yet of inflationary pressures.
Wait till the second half of the year, says Mr Turner's colleague Jonathan
Francis, Putnam's global strategist: 'That's when the chickens are going to
come home to roost.' GDP growth will slow, perhaps to around 2 1/2 -3 per
cent. Productivity growth, which has been swamping any wage pressures, will
disappear. And after the sharp rise in output of the early part of the year,
capacity utilisation will be around the 85 per cent level, the point at
which upward pressure on costs and prices usually starts to appear.
'If we're going to see an inflationary threat, it's going to be in the
second half of the year,' said Mr Turner.
Note that 'if'. It is what distinguishes this bond market rally from its
predecessors. At this point in any previous cycle - in recent memory, at
least - there would have been no 'if' about it. By now, inflationary
momentum would be irresistible. This time, the bond market cannot make up
its mind.
Back to 1894
One reason for this uncertainty, touched on in last week's column, is the
debate over the impact of 'globalisation' of markets on the developed
economies. At a micro level, the shift of manufacturing to south-east Asia
and (to a lesser extent) to Latin America, promises all sorts of disruptions
to western financial markets - to corporate bond markets just as much as to
equities.
At a macro level, though, the rapid growth of the non-OECD world could bring
unalloyed benefits. That, at least, is the conclusion reached by Sushil
Wadhwani and Mustaq Shah of Goldman Sachs in a recent paper*. As part of
their argument, they return to the period that exercises a morbid
fascination for British economic historians: the years between 1870 (when
Britain produced roughly a third of world industrial output) and 1914 (when
the UK share had fallen to only 14 per cent). In the same years, the US
share rose from around 23 per cent to 36 per cent.
For much of the period, the general price level fell in the UK. This, say
the authors 'is consistent with the notion of global competition exerting a
deflationary impact', though they accept that other factors may also have
been at work, including the behaviour of the money supply. Throughout those
years, bond yields were on a long-run down-trend, and UK productivity growth
lagged behind that in Germany and the US. The striking thing, however, is
that Britain's overall economic growth rate was not significantly slower, at
around 2 per cent, than in much of the earlier part of the century. And in
the last quarter of the 19th century, UK equities provided a real return of
over 8 per cent a year, a high figure by any standards.
Of course, at the turn of the century the UK equity market remained
undeveloped, with many big companies in family hands. Still, assuming that
these figures are representative, they lead the Goldman economists to a
number of interesting conclusions: Fast growth in the rest of the world does
not rule out acceptable growth in mature economies. Global competition may
indeed hold down developed-country inflation, creating an attractive
long-run environment for bonds. Equities may continue to outperform
fixed-income investments, though not by as much as is usual. And though
developing economies may in general provide better returns, there will be
periods when OECD stock markets do better.
Plumbers
A clutch of product announcements from Hewlett-Packard last week symbolised
the way in which the computer industry's old conventional wisdom is dying.
The old wisdom said that mainframes, minicomputers and workstations, though
undermined by personal computers, would retain important for serious
applications, the ones that keep a business going. Big computer companies
would have to slim down, but they could retain their existing business model
(lavish sales staff, lots of hand-holding, high gross margins). That belief,
already sickly, will finally succumb in 1994. Last week HP launched powerful
new workstations and 'business servers' which are replacements, in effect,
for old-style minicomputers, themselves replacements for old-style
mainframes.
HP's new machines perfectly illustrate the trend. The most significant
numbers about them are not the 16Mb or 60MHz that litter the HP releases;
they're the Dollars 3,995 price for the workstation. Not only is that
dangerously cheap, comparable with top-of-the-line PCs - it's also
consumer-style pricing, sneaking in just under the thousand dollar mark.
That's it, guys: once that shift happens, the old comfortable
business-to-business certainties go out of the window. And so does the gross
margin.
You knew all this? All right, but did you realise just what was happening to
the new conventional wisdom, too? People who long ago wrote off the
mainframe have been talking excitedly about 'the coming OS wars', the
looming battle between various new operating systems for desktop computers -
one from Microsoft, one from Apple and IBM, one from Novell, and so on. One
of these would take over from Microsoft's MS-Dos, the current industry
standard. Which was it to be?
In truth, since the operating system does a computer's most boring
housekeeping tasks, anyone who could get excited about OS wars would
probably love a TV show called Battle of the Sanitary Engineers.
It's all beside the point, anyway. HP also announced last week that its new
computers, though they have their own operating system, would also be able
to run any program written for Microsoft's Windows, the visual front end to
MS-Dos. Other companies have already pulled off the same trick. Windows has,
in effect, replaced MS-Dos as the world's standard, and the OS wars are
irrelevant.
Conclusions: 1. Microsoft's Bill Gates has done it again. 2. Only computer
companies that, like HP, have adapted to the new world can hope to survive.
3. If the prices in any industry suddenly shift from figures ending in zero
to ones ending in 95 or 99, watch out for companies whose cost structure and
volumes can't make the shift, too.

FT  24 JAN 94 / The Markets: Tax squeeze may force G7 to revitalise economic
co-operation - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's most exclusive club is in decline. A year ago, Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
freshly in-stalled as US Treasury Secretary, was champing at the bit to
breathe new life into the Group of Seven countries, comprising the US,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
As finance minister of the world's most potent industrial democracy, he
appeared to believe that more co-operation and less megaphone diplomacy
among the G7 could ease, if not solve, problems as diverse as Europe's mass
unemployment and faltering economic reform in Russia. This month, Mr Bentsen
has been globe-trotting, but mainly in east Asia. His talks in Japan
yesterday were tacked onto a round-the-world trip that started in Moscow and
continued in Indonesia, Thailand and China.
Little has been heard of the G7 of late. After years of huffing and puffing
over trade, it took a back seat in the final negotiations that secured the
Uruguay Round trade agreement in December.
US President Bill Clinton's plans for a special G7 meeting to tackle
unemployment, proposed last summer, have been painfully slow in reaching
fruition. After many delays, a meeting of labour and finance ministers has
been scheduled for mid-March, although officials are still unclear what will
be discussed.
G7 leaders, including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, have cast doubt
on the value of their annual economic summit. The meeting will be held again
this year - in Naples between July 8 and 10 - but is likely to be a low key
event compared with past extravaganzas. The group appears to have decided
that a low profile is the safest approach to the present difficulties in
Russia. In the past, the G7 has tried to guide events with an economic
carrot and stick.
The only known response to last week's exit of economic reformers from the
government in Moscow was a telephone call among senior officials on Friday
which seems to have reached no clear conclusions. There is strong case for
saying that such reticence is all to the good. International co-operation
can create rather than solve difficulties. Arguably, some of the problems of
the late 1980s - Japan's bubble economy and the UK's high inflation, for
example - can be blamed in part on over-enthusiastic attempts to co-ordinate
exchange rates and monetary policies among the G7.
Instead of grand international gestures, G7 nations in recent years have
concentrated on solving their own domestic economic problems first. Whether
by accident or design, one positive result has been a fall in inflation to
levels last seen in the 1960s.
The upper chart, based on projections in the December Economic Outlook from
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, suggests that
big industrial countries, by pursuing the Sinatra doctrine and 'doing it my
way', may be returning to synchronised and steady growth. But the bottom
chart, showing how taxes are due to rise as a share of national output in
Germany, Britain, Japan and the US, prompts some second thoughts. The lines
on the chart do not seem to rise dramatically. But they constitute a large
scale fiscal contraction in countries that together account for two thirds
of OECD output.
Only now is debate getting underway about the impact of the tax rises in the
countries concerned and opinions vary widely.
In the UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the
financial secretary, admit that the Pounds 8.4bn of tax increases due in
1994-95 will check the pace of recovery but are confident that the upturn
can be maintained. Others are less sure, hence the pressure for lower
interest rates.
Similar uncertainty surrounds the impact of higher US federal taxes which
will take effect very soon. Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist of Lehman
Brothers, told a recent investors' conference in London that the higher tax
rates, which are concentrated among wealthier households, are 'simply too
small in total and too narrowly focused to bring the economy down'.
Taking the opposite view last week was Mr Lacy Hunt, the chief US economist
of HSBC Holdings, which now has Midland Bank among its group members.
He estimates that the tax increases will take Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) a
week from consumers. This may seem small in a Dollars 6 trillion-a-year
economy. But Mr Hunt contends that the average US personal income tax rate
will reach a new record of 20 per cent this year and that the households
most affected by the higher taxes account for 18 per cent of consumers'
expenditure. The outcome, he says, will be a drop in the economic growth
rate to 1.5 per cent next year.
Germany's tax plans put other nations in the shade. The Bonn government's
annual economic report, to be published this week, is expected to project
increases of between 4.5 and 5.5 per cent in government revenues this year
as part of a multi-year programme of tax rises to pay for unification.
The OECD estimates that by 1995 western Germany will have experienced a
cumulative increase in its tax to GDP ratio of 5 percentage points since
unification. While Bonn believes the German economy should grow by 1 per
cent to 1.5 per cent this year, economists are sceptical. Mr Gerald Holtham,
Lehman Brothers' chief international economist in London, believes Germany
faces 'unprecedented consumer weakness' because of the government's actions.
It is highly unlikely that the combined impact of these independent fiscal
squeezes has been discussed by the politicians responsible for them. It may
be that world growth is sufficiently dynamic to overcome the contractionary
forces involved. However, it would be reassuring to know that potential
pitfalls have been considered.
The G7 would be a good place to start.

FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Full-year deficit for Amdahl of
Dollars 580m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, reported continuing losses for
its fourth quarter as it struggled to adjust to weak demand and fiercely
competitive pricing in the market for IBM-compatible mainframe computer
systems.
Fourth-quarter losses were Dollars 40.9m, or 36 cents per share, on revenues
of Dollars 443m. In the same period last year, the company recorded net
income of Dollars 2.4m, or 2 cents a share, and revenues of Dollars 745m
For the year, including third-quarter pre-tax restructuring charges of
Dollars 478m, net losses were Dollars 580m, or Dollars 5.09 a share, on
revenues of Dollars 1,68bn. In 1992, Amdahl incurred pre-tax workforce
reduction charges of Dollars 25m and suffered a net loss of Dollars 7m, or 6
cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 2.5bn.
Fujitsu of Japan, which holds a 44 per cent stake in Amdahl, has agreed to
provide the US company with Dollars 100m in low-interest loans, according to
reports from Japan - which also say Fujitsu will provide Amdahl with
high-speed work stations to be sold under the Amdahl brand name.
This month, Amdahl announced an agreement with Fujitsu jointly to develop a
new generation of mainframe computers. The agreement will reduce research
and development costs, it said.

FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Decline in profits slows at
Banco Central Hispano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano, Spain's largest bank in terms of assets, saw net
group profits after minorities drop by 8 per cent last year to Pta48.4bn
(Dollars 338m). The bank claimed it had turned round the balance sheet after
sustaining a 22 per cent fall in group income in 1992.
The results, which were ahead of analyst estimates, were the most keenly
awaited among those of Spain's top financial groups following the
intervention by the authorities at troubled rival bank Banesto at the end of
last year.
Pointing to the group's continued weakness in the basic lending business,
BCH's net interest income shrunk by 4.8 per cent to Pta299bn, but its
operating profit margin, including fee commissions and what the group called
financial operations, rose by 11.8 per cent to Pta465bn.
Financial operations, understood to be mainly foreign exchange and public
debt dealings, earned the group Pta81.5bn, against Pta19.8bn in 1992.
However, this is essentially a non-recurring item because it was realised in
the exceptional circumstances of sharp falls in interest rates and of a
rapidly weakening peseta during last year's European currency turmoils.
Net profits at BCH, which is still absorbing the impact of the 1991 merger
between Banco Central and Banco Hispano Americano that created the group,
are not expected to recover until next year.
The 1993 operating profit, however, showed a strong 26.2 per cent increase
to Pta172bn which allowed BCH to set aside Pta110bn for non-performing loan
provisions, up from a Pta86.4bn allocation for bad debts in 1992.
Aside from provisioning, BCH's balance sheet was penalised by a 39.7 per
cent fall in income to Pta7bn from the group's industrial assets, which
include some of the recession-hit domestic economy's top companies, and by a
12 per cent fall to Pta41.6bn in extraordinary income through disposals.

FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Trizec makes further provisions
of CDollars 287m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trizec, the Calgary-based property development group which is in the throes
of a debt restructuring exercise, has taken further write-downs to reflect
the slump in the North American commercial real estate market.
As a result of provisions of CDollars 287m, Trizec suffered a 1993 loss of
CDollars 312m (USDollars 238m), or CDollars 1.57 per share, despite a 13 per
cent rise in rental income.
The loss in 1992 was CDollars 544m, or CDollars 3.28, due largely to the
write-down of Trizec's investment in Bramalea, another financially stretched
developer which was restructured last year.
Trizec, controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, submitted a
debt-restructuring proposal to securities holders last August.
It is expecting a response from a crucial group of senior debenture holders
in the near future. In the meantime, it has suspended all principal and
interest payments.
Trizec has total debt of CDollars 4.8bn, but about two-thirds is held by
operating subsidiaries and is not included in the recapitalisation talks.
Moore Corp, the business forms maker, will eliminate 3,000 jobs worldwide as
it restructures and expands into information services, writes Robert Gibbens
in Montreal .
The USDollars 210m restructuring will result in a USDollars 155m after-tax
charge against fourth-quarter earnings, which will result in Moore reporting
a loss for 1993.
Moore, with annual sales of USDollars 2.5bn, has 150 plants in 57 countries
and 23,000 employees. Its biggest market is the US.
The paper forms business has been hit by the electronic revolution. Plants
will be closed in several countries, though the company would not be
specific.
One-quarter of the restructuring will affect the European subsidiaries but
the first major impact will come in the US where the order management system
will be revamped to cut overheads.
Canada's Labatt Breweries has capitalised on the domestic success of its
innovative ice-brewed beer by licensing the process to Coors, the
third-biggest US brewer.
Coors said it will use the ice-brewing process to produce a new brand, known
as Coors Arctic Ice, to be launched in nine US states in mid-February.

FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kellogg lifts fourth-quarter
earnings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kellogg, the US maker of ready-to-eat cereals, overcame the competitive
threat from unbranded rivals and increased net profits by 17 per cent to
Dollars 149.9m in its fourth quarter. Earnings per share rose by 22 per cent
to 66 cents.
However, the quarter's performance outshone the full year's. Net income of
Dollars 680.7m in 1993 was slightly below the previous year's Dollars 682.8m
(the latter figure excluding the effect of accounting changes).
But Kellogg said that if all unusual gains and losses were excluded from the
figures, net income would have been 6 per cent ahead.
Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive, said the results had been
achieved amid unprecedented competitive activity, difficult recessionary
conditions in several important markets, and unfavourable currency exchange
rates.
Sales volumes of ready-to-eat cereals continued to grow during the year,
particularly during the fourth quarter, Mr Langbo said. But he warned that
the growth pattern shown in the fourth quarter was not necessarily a good
guide to long-term performance.
'Our advertising and promotion investment rose during the fourth quarter due
to extremely competitive conditions in the US and a high level of marketing
activity internationally,' he explained.
'We see no let-up in competitive intensity in 1994. We are committed to
meeting all competitive challenges, but hope to moderate promotional
spending in the US.'
In the fourth quarter Kellogg authorised further share buy-backs of Dollars
300m this year.

<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana will take nearly full control of its 48-per cent
unit Banque Sudameris as a result of Dresdner Bank, Banque Indosuez, Paribas
and Union Bank of Switzerland pulling out, Reuter reports from Paris.
Dresdner, UBS, Paribas and Cie de Suez's Banque Indosuez each have 12 per
cent of Banque Sudameris.
Sudameris said the shareholders were planning to give up their
participations whereas Banca Commerciale Italiana, through its wholly owned
subsidiary Comit Holding International, would increase its own to take
majority control.
Banque Sudameris, a French bank whose main business is in Latin America,
said it would propose a capital reduction through a share buy-back, to a
shareholders' meeting on February 23.
An official said the bank would buy in the four banks' stakes and cancel
them, leaving BCI with 99 per cent. The price of the buy-back would be
announced later. The bank's total assets were FFr26.37bn (Dollars 4.51bn) on
June 30 1993 with a net worth of FFr2.46bn.
The Italian government plans to privatise BCI next month.

FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: China loosens foreign bank rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign financial institutions are to be allowed to conduct yuan-denominated
business on an 'experimental basis' in China.
Mr PK Mathur, Chase Manhattan's senior China representative, described the
move, which was welcomed by Western bankers, as a 'serious step in the right
direction'.
Previously, foreign bank branches had effectively been shut out of the local
currency market.
Friday's announcement, in a communique issued after a meeting in Beijing of
the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee (JEC), is certain to hasten the
scramble by foreign banks to gain a foothold in China.
Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, told Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
visiting US treasury secretary, that Beijing would allow foreign banks to
deal in yuan and would also open additional 'major cities' to foreign
financial institutions.
Foreign bankers expect the Chinese to move cautiously because of concerns
that China's debt-ridden and under-capitalised state-run banks would be
hard-pressed to compete with foreign institutions.
Foreign branches are likely to be restricted to accepting yuan-denominated
deposits from existing customers. Lending in local currency to joint
ventures would be permitted on a limited basis.
About 60 foreign branches and six joint-venture banks and finance houses
have been established in China since a gradual reform of the banking system
began in the early 1980s.
The foreign bank presence has been largely restricted to coastal cities and
special economic zones, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Dalian,
but it seems likely that branches will be permitted in major inland centres
such as Wuhan and Shenyang. Beijing itself has been off-limits to foreign
branches.
Chinese officials are also saying that restrictions on foreign insurance
companies will be eased. At present, only one foreign company, American
International Group, has been permitted to establish a presence in China.
Mr Chen Yuan, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's central bank,
told the Sino-US joint economic committee that an additional 'one or two'
foreign insurance companies would be allowed to enter the domestic market.
However, Mr Chen warned that it would 'take time' for China to work out a
plan to allow foreign financial organisations to conduct yuan business. He
said that the time was not yet ripe to open the securities market to foreign
companies since further work was needed on securities regulations.
The Chinese official said the State Council, China's cabinet, had recently
approved regulations governing the management of foreign financial
institutions, and these were expected soon to be made public after further
revision.

FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Eurotunnel in issue to
Bombardier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, is to seek the approval of
shareholders in its British and French companies for a further share issue
to Bombardier International, the Canadian manufacturer of its rolling stock,
writes Charles Batchelor.
Up to 25m Eurotunnel shares were allotted to Bombardier in December under
the settlement of its claim against Transmanche Link, the main contractor
for the tunnel, for costs arising from changes in the rolling stock design.
The French arm of Eurotunnel, Eurotunnel SA, will hold an extraordinary
meeting to discuss the latest share issue on January 31, while the UK arm,
Eurotunnel, will hold its meeting on February 17.
In the 'very likely event' that the 50 per cent quorum for the French
company is not met, its meeting will be adjourned until February 17 to
coincide with the UK meeting.
The share issue is intended to tie Bombardier's fortunes to those of the
tunnel.
ESC Wagons, the company created by Bombardier to build the trains, is also
to receive FFr700m (Pounds 80.4m) in phased cash payments.
On Friday Eurotunnel's shares closed at 568p.

FT  24 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes heads for market with Pounds 90m
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wainhomes, one of the 25 largest housebuilders in the UK, is poised to
announce plans for a stock market listing, together with an offer for sale
to raise money for expansion.
The exact amount to be raised has still to be decided, but the issue is
expected to value the group at about Pounds 90m.
It will be the latest in a series of fund raisings by large and medium-sized
housebuilders seeking to exploit the recovery in the private housing market.
Nearly Pounds 500m was raised by UK housebuilders from rights issues alone
last year, mostly to buy land. Last week Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based
housebuilder announced that it was raising Pounds 19.1m from a 1-for-4 issue
at 88p a share.
Wainhomes was formed in 1989 by the merger of three privately owned
housebuilders operating mainly in north-west England. These were: Whelmar, a
former housebuilding subsidiary of Christian Salvesen based in Chester;
Wainhomes, based in Standish near Wigan and, Lanley which operated in the
Preston area.
The merged businesses have proved resilient during the recession, with
pre-tax profits never falling below Pounds 5.3m for the year to March 31
1993. This compares with a peak of Pounds 8.6m during 1989-90.
The company is expanding into other regions, including Yorkshire, Hampshire
and Dorset and the south-east Midlands.
Sales outside the north-west are likely to account for about 200 of the 900
homes expected to be built during the 12 months to the end of March.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits to be about Pounds 6m, with turnover likely
to exceed Pounds 70m.
Net borrowings of Pounds 12m, representing gearing of about 25 per cent, are
expected to be wiped out following the offer for sale. This will leave the
group in a strong position to increase its landholdings of 2,400 plots,
which at the current sales level is equivalent to just under three years'
supply.
The company in recent years has concentrated on buying small sites, which
are less attractive to large volume builders. It believes this approach has
enabled it to achieve better margins as well as providing more outlets.
Institutions own 35 per cent of the shares. Another 33 per cent belongs to
the family interests of Mr Bill Ainscough, owner of the original Wainhomes
business. Mr Trevor Hemmings, former owner of Lanley, has a 17 per cent
stake and 15 per cent is held by former managers of Welmar, which acquired
the company in a management buy-out from Christian Salvesen.
Following the offer for sale and listing, Mr Gavin Reed, vice chairman of
Scottish and Newcastle brewery group, is expected to become non-executive
chairman of Wainhomes. Mr Ainscough will become deputy chairman. Mr Ron
Smith will remain chief executive.

FT  24 JAN 94 / UK Company News: All eyes on a regional success - Midland
Independent Newspapers' flotation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Independent Newspapers, which publishes the Birmingham Post and
Mail, is hoping to raise more than Pounds 100m in a flotation planned for
March.
Although no price has yet been set, the hope is that the regional newspaper
group taken over in a management buy-out in 1991 will be capitalised at more
than Pounds 150m.
The announcement today of the flotation by way of a placing and public offer
covering more than 50 per cent of the shares, will be accompanied by results
for the year to December showing group turnover on continuing operations of
Pounds 70.7m, up from Pounds 65.2m previously.
The group will also report operating profit on continuing operations before
exceptional expenses (mainly interest on the MBO finance) of Pounds 15.2m,
compared with Pounds 13m.
The management team of six which, led by Mr Chris Oakley, the chief
executive, organised the buy-out from Ingersoll Newspapers, will share
equally in 7.5 per cent of the equity. The stake could rise to 17.5 per
cent, depending on performance until June 1996.
The flotation will almost certainly create six new newspaper industry
millionaires, at least on paper.
The flotation, the first totally regional newspaper group to come to the
stock exchange for a number of years, is likely to focus attention on the
regional newspaper industry.
Although sales of regional newspapers have been in gradual decline - total
sales dropped from 17.4m in 1981 to 13.8m in 1992 - well managed companies
have been increasing profit margins.
Despite the recession, MIN for instance has increased operating profit
margins on continuing operations from 8.9 per cent in 1991 to 21.4 per cent.
All six members of the management team at Birmingham have worked in
newspapers all their lives and had often felt constrained in trying out new
ideas while working for other groups.
'We knew what to do to get costs down, but we also thought we knew what to
do to build revenues and sales given the right policy. We were at it from
the first day (of taking over),' says Mr Oakley.
The group has also pursued a strategy of expansion into the East Midlands,
so that it can offer advertising coverage of the entire region.
Last year it acquired 20 free weeklies from Thomson regional group, ranging
from Derby to Northampton. The papers had been losing Pounds 2m a year.
'We made them profitable from the week we owned them,' says Mr Oakley, who
came from the Birmingham Post as editor in chief and soon after became
managing director.
MIN's main titles mostly lost circulation last year, but the fall was below
the industry average of between 3 and 4 per cent.
The Evening Mail at 205,000 was down just under 3 per cent for the year, the
Birmingham Post circulation rose nearly 1 per cent to 26,000, the Sunday
Mercury lost 2.5 per cent to 150,000 and the Coventry Evening Telegraph
dropped just under 2 per cent to 88,000.
Apart from cutting costs, setting tough advertising targets and pushing
ahead with geographical expansion throughout its region, the MIN management
has developed a range of new publications from What's On titles to county
magazines.
'We are locking up our market place. What we are trying to do everywhere is
to have a whole range of products to give advertisers a choice,' the MIN
chief executive explained recently.
The choice includes being able to deliver leaflets, catalogues and sometimes
even products such as chocolate bars to every home in the region.
James Capel, broker to the issue, which is being sponsored by Morgan
Grenfell, is publishing research on the regional newspaper industry this
week. It forecasts substantial profits growth in the short term as the
cyclical recovery in advertising, particularly classified, gets under way.
The stockbroker believes that in the longer term the sector remains
attractive, despite growing competition from the electronic media, because
barriers to entry are high and competition though fierce is rational.
On MIN itself James Capel says the company enjoys a dominant market position
in Birmingham and Coventry and 'is a good way of getting exposure to the UK
regional newspaper industry.'
Mr Oakley is already looking beyond the flotation and considering expansion
outside the Midlands, if he can find the right acquisitions. 'We believe we
could go to Swindon, or Darlington or York and produce 20 per cent-plus
profit margins,' he says.

FT  24 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke Pounds 82m HK bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke, the leisure and property group, is to reap an Pounds 82m windfall
this year from the early termination of a management contract for its Hilton
hotel in Hong Kong.
The funds will be used to reduce the UK group's Pounds 1.3bn debt. Ladbroke
has already announced its intention to withdraw from commercial property,
valued in the books at Pounds 860m, to cut borrowings.
Ladbroke said yesterday that Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate
which owns the hotel, had offered to pay Dollars 125m in compensation for
the management contract. The proceeds will be included as an exceptional
profit in the group's results for 1994.
The Hong Kong Hilton had been one of Ladbroke's most profitable management
deals, and was due to run for a further 20 years.
In the year ended December 31, the hotel contributed management fees of
Dollars 6m. The contract is due to expire before the end of next January,
when 'Hutchison Whampoa will . . . review and evaluate the hotel's future,'
Ladbroke said.
Hutchison Whampoa is believed to be considering a sale of the centrally
located site, given the buoyant property market in Hong Kong. An alternative
use of the site would have been impossible due to the conglomerate's
obligation to Ladbroke.

Coda, the Harrogate-based software company which is coming to the main
market early in February, is hoping that an early move into 'open' systems
will propel it to the front of the international accountancy software field.
Open software is written to a specific industry standard; it will run on any
computer or computer network which complies with that standard. It is being
demanded increasingly by customers.
Coda ranks 14th in a market dominated by the large US companies Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Software and Computer Associates and the fast-growing German
challenger, SAP.
According to IDC, the marketing consultancy which compiled the list, no
other player has more than 3 per cent of the market. Coda has 1 per cent.
'We could be fourth,' muses Mr Rodney Potts, co-founder and chairman 'We
should be fourth.' To do so, it will have to overtake companies including JD
Edwards, Walker Interactive, Ross Systems and Software 2000. Last year Coda
made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.75m on revenues of Pounds 23.5m.
The prospectus is published today in the run up to the placing, which should
provide the best part of Pounds 25m, less expenses, to invest in research
and development and geographical expansion. Warburgs is managing the
placement.
The UK is seeing something of a renaissance in the development of
accountancy packages. Sage has established itself as market leader in
personal computing packages, while Quality Software Products continues to
show promise in very large scale modular packages.
Coda's product, featuring a fully-integrated unified database, is aimed at
companies turning over at least Pounds 100m.
Coda started 15 years ago by developing its software for three mid-range
computer families: Hewlett Packard, Digital Equipment and International
Business Machines.
In 1990, it began to develop an open systems version and now claims it is
its most highly featured product.
Expenditure on research and development is about 13 per cent of turnover,
which is written off in the year it is incurred.
Coda's second strategic aim is to develop critical mass in key international
markets. It sells only through wholly owned subsidiaries, rather than
dealers.
Mr Potts defined critical mass as a sound, locally recruited, management
team, 20 staff, up to 40 customers and between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m
profits.
The US accounts for 46 per cent of group sales.

FT  24 JAN 94 / China becomes joint ventures hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China and Russia have emerged as centres of international takeover activity
with overseas companies investing more than Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.8bn)
there in the past 12 months, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
The firm's annual survey of global takeover activity, published today, shows
that investors in China took part in partial acquisitions and joint ventures
worth Dollars 15.2bn, up from Dollars 5.2bn in 1992. The value of companies
purchased outright rose from Dollars 89m to Dollars 287m.
The increase meant China was second only to the US in selling equity stakes
and joint venture opportunities.
Russia, where the value of partial takeovers increased from Dollars 349m to
Dollars 6.6bn, was ranked fifth, behind Britain and the Netherlands.
Mr Richard Agutter, chairman of KPMG's corporate finance department, warned
that the pace of future investment in Russia could be undermined by
right-wing electoral gains. Uncertainties over the political future of Hong
Kong had slowed UK investment in China, he added.
The total value of worldwide cross-border mergers and acquisitions,
meanwhile, declined 14.6 per cent to Dollars 64bn last year as many
countries endured recession. KPMG said uncertainties over the Maastricht
treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade talks also persuaded companies to postpone M&amp;A plans.
Japanese companies made some of sharpest cutbacks, with the value of their
outright acquisitions falling by more than 86 per cent from Dollars 4.3bn in
1992 to Dollars 558m last year.
The value of partial takeovers and joint ventures by Japanese groups also
fell sharply - down more than 70 per cent to Dollars 4bn. Mr Agutter blamed
the decline on Japan's slowing domestic economy, and he said similar factors
held back activity in France, Germany and Italy.
The value of outright acquisitions by French companies fell by almost half
to Dollars 5.9bn; German groups cut purchases by 21 per cent to Dollars
3.2bn; while the Italian total fell more than 92 per cent to Dollars 463m.
'Companies in all these countries are being more cautious. They don't want
to buy outright any more, they prefer to share the risk,' he said.
Britain and the US, however, increased M&amp;A dealings. Outright acquisitions
by British companies more than doubled to Dollars 13.5bn, while purchases by
US groups rose from Dollars 14.5bn to Dollars 15.3bn.
Mr Agutter highlighted deals such as Unilever's Pounds 220m takeover last
December of Ortiz-Miko, the French frozen foods manufacturer, and BT's
decision to take a Dollars 4.3bn stake in MCI as examples of increased
activity. He said confidence in North America and the UK was also reflected
by an increase in 'global capital flows' - KPMG's valuation of total
purchases and disposals. This figure rose from Dollars 203bn in 1992 to
Dollars 216bn last year.
Forecasting increased activity in 1994, Mr Agutter said there would be more
joint venture agreements rather than outright acquisitions.
The amount spent by companies on European cross-border mergers fell by 40
per cent last year to Ecu31.35bn (Pounds 23.3bn), the lowest level since
1988, according to a survey by Translink, the cross-border M&amp;A adviser.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Looking back to get the future in
the frame - WH Smith/Menzies/MFI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's largest newspaper, books, stationery and music retailers -
John Menzies and WH Smith - are expected to announce increases in interim
profits this week.
Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group, is expected today
to announce increased profits for the six months to October from Pounds 3.8m
to between Pounds 4.1m and Pounds 5m. As with other retailers announcing
results, however, analysts are at least as interested in what it has to say
about the Christmas trading period. They expect a reasonably strong
performance from Early Learning Centre, Menzies' educational toyshop chain,
with sales rising by up to 8 per cent, but less strong trading from the
Menzies chain, though sales are expected to have risen by up to 4 per cent.
WH Smith reports on Wednesday, and profits are expected to be up from Pounds
40.2m to Pounds 42m-Pounds 46m for the six months to November. Sales
increases for the first half may be flattered somewhat by weak comparatives
from the year before, with the second half comparatives getting more
difficult. But strong trading is expected both in the first half and over
Christmas from the UK retailing and distribution businesses, with sales
rises possibly into double digits.
However, there may have been some loss of margin in the music business, and
analysts suggest results from the US may be less good than hoped. Losses may
have been cut slightly at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with Boots.
Thursday sees interim results from furniture retailer MFI, with analysts'
uncertainty about its performance reflected by the wide spread of forecasts
from about Pounds 17m to about Pounds 25m - up from Pounds 12.7m last year,
excluding the profit on MFI's sale of shares in Carpetright. Its comments on
the January sale period will attract attention, following market rumours
that trading may have been dull.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Return to profits predicted for steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the biggest US steel companies are predicting a continuing sharp
upturn in their operating performance this year, in the process pushing the
industry as a whole back into profit after one of its most prolonged periods
of losses.
Results released by two of the six big integrated steel producers last week
indicated that soaring demand from carmakers and the construction industry
had already driven the steel companies' output and prices sharply higher.
US Steel, the US's biggest producer, said sales in the final three months of
last year were 28 per cent higher than a year before, at Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1.01), helped by an 18 per cent rise in the amount of steel shipped
and a series of price rises. 'The market outlook is solid, with order book
levels high through the first quarter,' added Charles Corry, chairman of US
Steel's parent company, USX.
Robert Darnall, chairman of Inland Steel, which turned an operating loss of
Dollars 173m in 1992 into a profit of Dollars 27m last year, was even more
optimistic. 'We expect a continued improvement in our operating results of
at least the same magnitude as we experienced in 1993,' he said.
The heightened demand for steel has meant that producers have been operating
at near-full capacity, supporting the price rises introduced last year. US
Steel said it was operating at 98 per cent of capacity in the final months
of 1993, compared with 84 per cent at the end of 1992. Inland Steel, held
back by the shut-down of a blast furnace and coke plant, sagged to 74 per
cent.
The demand for their products in the US has already made the steel companies
among the best-performing on Wall Street so far this year.
US Steel on Friday reported net income for the last quarter of 1993 at
Dollars 124m (Dollars 1.67 a share), compared with an after-tax loss of
Dollars 225m (Dollars 3.80 a share) the year before. Inland Steel made a net
loss of Dollars 20m (79 cents a share), compared with a net loss of Dollars
67m (Dollars 2.15 a share) the year before.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Reasons for Big Blue to feel more
cheery - IBM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's far too soon to cheer a sustained recovery at International Business
Machines, but the stock market expects hard evidence in tomorrow's results
that Big Blue is beginning to lose the worst of its big blues. For Mr Louis
Gerstner, appointed to 'the toughest job in corporate America' just under a
year ago, the results will be the first indication of the effectiveness of a
recovery strategy that has often seemed understated if not invisible.
The principal task has been to begin the transformation of a company
designed to sell mainframe computers at high gross profit margins into an
organisation able to survive on the low margins typical of the personal
computer business. Mr Gerstner has already grouped mainframes, minicomputers
and workstations together and placed a new emphasis on 'client server'
computing.
With bloodbath in the industry continuing, revenues are likely to be flat at
around Dollars 63bn. But the scene should be set for 2-3 per cent growth
next year, about half the industry average. Earnings per share of about 63
cents are predicted for the final quarter of 1993, giving a full-year loss
of 8 cents per share against a surplus, before restructuring charges and tax
of Dollars 2.36. IBM UK was the company's blackest spot last year. Its
performance in 1993 may be a litmus test of IBM's recovery.

A tough and erratic year for continuous ink jet printer makers is expected

leaders in a market dominated by UK-owned companies, Domino's share price

Despite continuing sluggishness in the US and Germany, there has been some

The spate of retailers' Christmas trading statements draws to a close this
week with announcements expected from fashion groups Burton and Next on
Thursday. Analysts are expecting only a moderate increase in sales at
Burton, with a stronger performance from department store group Debenhams
than from the high street chains. They are also nervous that earlier hopes
that margins would have been held may not be fulfilled. Next is thought to
have had a strong Christmas, with sales up as much as 14 or 15 per cent.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Checking Lonrho's 'normal'
temperature - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's annual results for the year to September 30, to be announced
tomorrow, are the first it has published since Mr Dieter Bock, its German
joint chief executive, started the process of making the international
trading group a 'more normal company', in his words. Last autumn, he
succeeded in having non-executives appointed to the board for the first time
in 20 years and in setting up an audit committee to review auditing
procedures and financial performance.
The figures will, therefore, be of particular interest to see if the audit
committee's influence is apparent - and whether the company statement
contains any tell-tale signs of the state of the battle between Mr Bock and
his fellow joint chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland. Analysts believe that
profits from ongoing businesses doubled last year to around Pounds 80m and
that the figure including gains from disposals could be as high as Pounds
140m.

FT  24 JAN 94 / State-run groups get used to new identity: Europe's
governments are finding both political and commercial reasons for turning to
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, JOHN RIDDING, QUENTIN PEEL, HAIG SIMONIAN, PETER WISE
and KAREN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation in Europe seems to have acquired an unstoppable momentum.
Across the Continent, the idea that the state should own or operate
commercial assets has lost its political force. In some cases, governments
are driven to privatise by the need to reduce their ballooning deficits. But
there is another powerful and deep-seated argument, that of commercial
logic.
In a growing number of sectors, from telecommunications to cars, there is
competitive pressure on companies to form cross-border alliances. The
private sector is reluctant to get involved with state-owned companies. For
many of Europe's state-owned giants, privatisation has thus become a
condition for staying in the game.
If the political argument is secondary, it is still important. In Italy, for
instance, it matters a great deal whether privatised companies should end up
controlled by a handful of old-style industrial empires or should have a
wide shareholder base. If the former, runs the argument, the country cannot
put its scandal-ridden past behind it. Thus, privatisation becomes in itself
a political weapon, as it was in the UK in the early 1980s.
FRANCE: The French programme, launched last October by the centre-right
government of the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, is Europe's largest.
It involves 21 public sector groups and should raise more than FFr250bn
(Pounds 28.70bn). The implications go far beyond a much-needed boost to
budgetary receipts. Some of France's most powerful industrial and financial
groups, such as Elf-Aquitaine, Renault and Union des Assurances de Paris,
should soon be in private hands.
The government is also motivated by a desire to ease the shackles on state
industry and encourage efficiency. 'The French government should not be in
the business of making cars,' said industry minister Mr Gerard Longuet,
referring to plans to privatise Renault.
The programme has got off to a strong start. The first two privatisation
issues - Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the country's biggest banks, and
Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group - were heavily oversubscribed by both
individual and institutional investors. The biggest operation on the list,
the sale of most of the government's 51 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine, was
launched last week.
The sale of a large part of public sector industry will mean an extension of
alliances between French business groups. The absence of powerful pension
funds, and the government's desire to ensure management stability and the
French identity of privatised companies, has led to the development of the
so-called noyau dur - core groups of long-term investors.
Some companies on the privatisation list, such as Rhone Poulenc, have
behaved like private sector companies for many years. But the state will
retain an influence. In the first few privatisations launched by the
Balladur government, for example, some of the core shareholders are
themselves state-owned companies.
More directly, the government will retain a golden share in some of the
privatisation candidates deemed to be strategically important or politically
sensitive, such as Elf. Political influence may also work at a personal
level. While avoiding a witch hunt of chief executives of public sector
groups, Mr Balladur has installed his own appointees at several key posts.
GERMANY: The federal government in Germany is pressing ahead slowly but
steadily with its privatisation plans, including its jewel, Deutsche
Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly. The 16 state governments, as well
as local authorities, are showing far less enthusiasm, with the notable
exception of Bavaria.
The privatisation process for Deutsche Telekom, valued at between DM40bn
(Pounds 15.60bn) and DM60bn, is at the point of decision. Cross-party
agreement is necessary to change the constitution, as it will be to sell the
51 per cent stake the government still holds in Lufthansa, the loss-making
national airline. In both cases, it is not so much concern over future
ownership of the assets that is holding up the process, as fears over the
jobs and pensions of state employees.
The government's chief success so far has been in selling off random bits
and pieces of the portfolio, rather than headline-catching jewels. In
December, it sold its remaining 50 per cent of the
Industrieverwaltungsgesellschaft (IVG), a property holding company, for some
DM700m.
The most mature plans now are for the sale of the government publishing
venture, Bundesanzeiger Verlagsgesellschaft, motorway service stations
(Autobahn Rast und Tank AG) and Rhein-Main-Donau AG, which built the
Rhine-Main-Danube canal, jointly owned with Bavaria.
The latter has promised to dispose of some DM2bn of its assets, with a deal
already done on the sale of Bayernwerk, Germany's third-largest electricity
utility. Other plum state shareholdings under fire include Lower Saxony's 20
per cent holding in Volkswagen, and North Rhine-Westphalia's 43.5 per cent
stake in the Westdeutsche Landesbank, the most acquisitive of Germany's
public sector banks. Neither of those Social Democrat-ruled states shows any
sign of wishing to dispose of their lucrative investments, in spite of the
acute financial squeeze on all their exchequers.
ITALY: After a series of false starts, Italy's ambitious privatisation
programme began in earnest last year. The list of assets for sale covers the
most successful subsidiaries of the big Iri and Eni state holding companies.
Disposals began late in 1993, with the privatisation of Credito Italiano,
Italy's seventh-biggest bank, raising about L1,750bn (Pounds 697.10m). In
December, Eni followed with its Nuovo Pignone engineering arm for about
L1,100bn.
The focus this year is on the banking sector. On January 31, the treasury
will float about half its controlling stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano,
the big Rome-based financial services group, for up to L2,200bn.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, another IRI-controlled bank, will follow in
February. IRI will dispose of its entire 57 per cent stake, valuing the
transaction at about L2,500bn.
The remaining deals are less advanced. Investors should be offered a first
tranche of shares in the big Ina life insurance group by the middle of this
year. And 1994 should close with the sale of a first slice of shares in
Enel, Italy's electricity generating authority.
The timing for privatisations scheduled for 1995 is less certain. According
to the treasury's forecast, the year should bring the disposal of much of
the Stet telecommunications group, restructured into Telecom Italia, and the
sale of a large proportion of Eni's oil and gas activities, probably under
the well-known Agip banner.
The deals have been accompanied by measures to stimulate popular share
ownership and increase liquidity on the relatively small Milan bourse. Not
all these plans have been successful. But probably the biggest stimulus has
come from outside the government's orbit. The fall in interest rates
worldwide has revived interest in the equity market, pumping billions of
lira into equity funds and leading to a much greater public awareness of the
potential attractions of the bourse.
PORTUGAL: The weight of state-owned companies in the Portuguese economy is
due to be halved by the time the current term of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the
prime minister, ends in October 1995. The main aim is to reverse a wave of
Communist-led nationalisations that turned key industries and almost all the
financial sector over to state control following the 1974 revolution.
A key aim of the centre-right government is to promote the growth of private
Portuguese entrepreneurial groups. It has imposed limits of around 25 per
cent on foreign holdings in most privatised companies.
Forthcoming privatisations include the second phase of the sale of the state
oil company Petrogal, Banco Sotto &amp; Pinto Mayor and the steel company
Siderurgia Nacional.
GREECE: Greece's privatisation programme has been thrown into disarray by
the victory of Mr Andreas Papandreou's Socialist government in last year's
elections. No renationalisation is expected. However, the Socialists called
off the proposed sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE, the telecoms company,
and have frozen agreements with foreign financial advisers.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Bentsen warns of US-Japan trade deal review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, warned yesterday that his country
would have to re-examine the basis of its bilateral trade agreements with
Japan if negotiations failed to make substantial progress by next month.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, is to meet President Bill
Clinton in Washington on February 11.
Mr Bentsen refused to spell out what the re-examination might entail. But
his statement shows that the US has no intention of letting up pressure on
the embattled Japanese government, which has had to defer other business
while it attempts to reach a compromise with the opposition on political
reform.
'I do not mean (the re-examination) to be a threat. But we are just facing
the realities of the situation,' Mr Bentsen said yesterday after meeting Mr
Hosokawa and Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. He said the discussion had
been 'very candid'.
The US wants Japan to open its market to greater imports and to take
measures to reduce the country's record Dollars 120bn-a-year trade surplus.
Mr Bentsen said: 'Japan is out of step. It has the lowest penetration of
manufactured imports, and it has the lowest foreign investment levels among
the major nations.'
The negotiations' sticking point appears to be the creation of indicators to
ensure that any agreements are properly implemented. The Japanese fear that
any objective criteria would form a commitment to set aside certain market
shares to overseas companies.
Mr Bentsen said: 'From our perspective, we would far prefer no agreements to
weak agreements. They would have to include indicators to show we are making
progress.'
Mr Bentsen also called for a sustained and strong fiscal stimulus by the
government. He said Japan had promised in the past to do what was necessary
to achieve strong domestic demand-led growth and a highly significant
reduction in its current account imbalance. In theory a domestic recovery
would draw in imports.
'If you look at the figures, that hasn't happened yet. In addition, the
forecasts are not very encouraging,' he said.
Mr Fujii had agreed it was not in the interests of Japan or the rest of the
world for Japan to have such a large trading surplus, Mr Bentsen said. The
finance minister yesterday promised serious and vigorous efforts to launch a
new stimulus package, including tax cuts to spur domestic demand.

FT  24 JAN 94 / OECD joblessness study focuses on capital tax: Long-term
unemployment linked to crime and drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher taxation on capital to offset reductions in non-wage labour costs is
one of several radical proposals for reducing unemployment suggested in a
study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The draft policy conclusion of the long-awaited report, which is likely to
shape debate at President Bill Clinton's Group of Seven jobs summit in
March, emphasises the need for greater flexibility in labour markets to
increase employment, but falls short of advocating wide US-style wage
differentials and labour market deregulation.
The report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, has
just been sent to the 24 member governments. It is not due to be published
until June. It finds little evidence that trade with low-wage countries is a
big cause of unemployment in the developed world. It does, however,
explicitly link long-term unemployment to rising levels of crime and drug
abuse and an 'unravelling of the social fabric'.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general who was commissioned by
member states to produce the report in June 1992, rejected the accusation
that he was being alarmist about the effects of unemployment. 'There is a
link between unemployment and crime and drugs, and I would be happy to see a
mandate from member countries to study that link,' he said in an interview.
He said the US had much more employment flexibility than Europe but at the
expense of social solidarity, and he warned that a policy emphasis on
flexibility and deregulation alone could lead to social dislocation.
The OECD's policy proposals have eight points at their core: nurture an
entrepreneurial climate; improve labour force skills and competences;
enhance the diffusion of technological knowhow; increase wage and labour
cost flexibility; reform job security provisions; increase working-time
flexibility; encourage a switch from passive to active labour market
measures; and reform benefit systems to increase work incentives.
On cutting non-wage labour costs, the report says: 'A significant
revenue-neutral cut in payroll taxes could yield important increases in
employment over the medium term.' With international co-ordination, the
burden should be switched to consumption taxes, environmental taxes or
higher effective taxation of capital income.
On training, the report says that levy systems - where companies pay a
proportion of the wage bill on training or pay an equivalent levy - have
been a disappointment. But the OECD does suggest that countries should
reform accounting standards for training expenditure and allow the costs of
training to be written off over the lifetime of the asset and not just when
the cost was incurred.
It also argues that statutory minimum wages can have a negative effect on
employment and that their redistributive goals can be achieved more
effectively through income supplements.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the 22 per cent rise in the CAC 40 last year, the French bourse has
started 1994 in more subdued mood. As elsewhere, the worry is whether the
economy can deliver the performance the market's rating now demands. The
French government's obsession with a strong franc at the cost of high real
interest rates has squeezed the economy hard. Unemployment remains above 12
per cent. Consumer confidence is fragile.
Official statistics suggest the French economy is on a slight upward track.
But there could be a sharper rebound in corporate earnings this year. The
high levels of provisioning, which caused corporate earnings to undershoot
expectations last year, could produce a suspiciously strong recovery in
1994. The other great hope is that continuing interest rate cuts will cause
an avalanche of cash to slide from money market funds into equities. That,
though, will be at least partially absorbed by new equity issues. Quite
apart from the FFr55bn of privatisation sales pencilled in for this year,
the corporate sector will continue to launch rights issues to ease strained
balance sheets.
The market will thus probably remain jumpy until the economic uncertainties
are resolved. The savage treatment handed out to Alcatel-Alsthom after
issuing a profits warnings suggests it will be unforgiving of any
disappointment. That makes privatisation of Elf Aquitaine a particularly
delicate task. Its payment of an uncovered dividend shows how keen it is to
underpin the shares. But the French government cannot afford to be
over-ambitious about the sale price.

FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite their strong rise in recent weeks, Nestle shares have been thrown
into the shade on the Swiss market as financial stocks have surged ahead.
But Nestle's forecast of a 5 per cent increase in 1993 sales confirms its
solid progress. Trading momentum has picked up since last autumn and Nestle
will report a 1.7 per cent increase in volume growth for 1993. That falls
short of its target rate of 4 per cent a year but compares favourably with
most international food groups.
Nestle has been making good volume gains in higher value-added areas, such
as pharmaceuticals, which will help protect group margins. But its markets
in Europe have remained tough. Delays in dealing with Perrier threaten to
dilute earnings, but restructuring at its US operations appears to be
bearing fruit. However, Nestle's great appeal stems from its exposure to
fast-expanding economies in Asia and Latin America. With 23 per cent of
sales coming from emerging economies, Nestle is the best placed food group
to ride the wave of global growth.
Nevertheless, the company has much work left in the old world. It has yet to
make sense of weak market positions in European pet food, canned products,
and frozen foods. This suggests higher restructuring charges may disfigure
its accounts in years to come. Despite its prodigious cash flow, Nestle may
also be temporarily constrained by year-end gearing of around 55 per cent.
That hardly bothers it in the normal run of events, but suggests it would
have to use paper to consummate any grander designs on L'Oreal.

FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: The balance in power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has yet to produce
his verdict on the generating companies, despite a promise to deliver it by
mid-January. His report may not now be published until next month.
Investors, probably correctly, have concluded that the delay implies that
talks are still going on which will avoid the companies being referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The regulator seems to want National
Power and PowerGen to agree to dispose of some generating plant and accept a
voluntary cap on spot electricity prices. Since the companies probably have
more to lose through an MMC reference, they are under pressure to agree. On
the other hand, practically none of the important political constituencies
now want a reference, so the regulator is a little hemmed in.
If a deal is done, there will probably be some impact on profits. The
generators' high dividend cover and provisions do, however, offer a defence.
Even so, with the shares now yielding 20 per cent less than the market
average, a good part of the growth prospects are already in price. By
contrast, the regional electricity companies are still cheap, with above
average yields, since investors regard them as pure utilities. Yet their
financial strength and dividend growth prospects are not those of a utility.
The strong cash flow and low ratings may soon attract predators. If the RECs
do not move quickly to unlock the value of their National Grid holdings, and
return other excess capital to shareholders, someone else may do it for
them.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Rowland allies near agreement to resign from Lonrho board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four of Mr Tiny Rowland's closest supporters on the board of Lonrho are near
to agreeing to resign from the company in return for payments equivalent to
two years' salary.
The move would leave Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive of Lonrho with Mr
Rowland, in control of the international conglomerate. Since joining Lonrho
a year ago, Mr Bock has been battling with Mr Rowland to transform the
trading group into a more orthodox company.
The resignation deal may be announced on Tuesday together with the group's
annual results. Shareholders' approval for the payments will probably be
sought as the four directors are on one-year contracts - any compensation
arrangements above the contractual obligation must be put to a shareholders'
vote.
The directors discussing the terms for early departure are Mr Rene Leclezio,
chairman, and Sir Peter Youens, both in their 70s, and the two deputy
chairmen, Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, who are in their mid-60s.
Last year, Mr Bock succeeded in appointing non-executives to the Lonrho
board for the first time in 20 years. His priority for months has been to
arrange the resignations of a few directors closely linked to Mr Rowland.
Severance pay for the four, which could be around Pounds 500,000 each for Mr
Spicer and Mr Leclezio, has to be generous since Lonrho's articles of
association make the departure of any director conditional on that
director's consent. Directors can only be removed with the unanimous
approval of the board.
However, some Lonrho shareholders are likely to be reluctant to agree to
such generous departure terms. Rather than risk a public dispute over the
payments, Mr Bock had originally considered paying the four their
contractual entitlements and then a further amount, described as consultancy
payments, equivalent to an extra 12 months' salary. That would have avoided
a shareholder vote.
However, Mr Bock is keen that the company should be seen to be following the
Cadbury Committee's code on corporate governance and felt that avoiding a
shareholder vote would not be within the spirit of the code.
At the group's annual meeting in March, shareholders will be asked to vote
in favour of changes to the group's articles of association which would
allow directors to be removed by a simple majority and the introduction of a
retirement age of 65. Mr Rowland, who is 76, would be exempt from this rule.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Anglo-Irish co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Anglo-Irish strategy for bringing peace to Northern Ireland has not yet
brought about a ceasefire, but that is no reason to abandon it. Launched
shortly before Christmas over the signatures of both Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, its
great strength is that it is a joint enterprise. This confers a political
advantage that the terrorists cannot match. It puts London and Dublin
unequivocally on the same side in promoting the use of the democratic
process as the sole legitimate means of solving the problem of two
communities living together on one island.
In contrast the perpetrators of violence appear to be divided. The Irish
Republican Army is evidently unwilling to stop its murderous campaign.
Perhaps it is unable to do so, for fear of provoking self-destructive
in-fighting. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, speaks of an opportunity for peace, but has not shown himself
capable of delivering a ceasefire. Instead he has ducked and weaved, talking
of time for consideration, asking for clarification, trying to shift the
blame for the violence to the British - in short, playing for time and
appealing to a wide range of public opinion.
'Unionist veto'
Mr Adams' argument, and in particular his insistent objection to what he
calls the 'Unionist veto' over any future pan-Irish settlement, was
demolished by Mr Reynolds on Thursday night. In an important speech, the
Taoiseach recalled the UN charter, the Helsinki Final Act, the UN
declaration on principles of international law (1960) and even South Korea's
acknowledgement that reunification with North Korea should not be sought by
violent means. All these authorities, plus Irish history, were invoked in
support of the contention that 'the people of Northern Ireland have the
right to determine by a majority whether they wish to stay with Britain or
join a sovereign united or agreed Ireland'.
The Irish prime minister noted that his joint declaration with Mr Major also
recognised the right of self-determination of the nationalist - that is,
Catholic - community in the north. But a united Ireland could not be
achieved by either political or military force, only by persuasion.
'Accordingly, there is not merely no moral justification, but also no
coherent ideological basis for a continuation of armed struggle,' he said.
IRA isolated
Given time, the persistent demonstration that the IRA cannot justify its
attacks, even to most people in its own natural constituency, will isolate
it, both within these troubled islands and internationally. The speech by
the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, on Thursday night
pursued a similar objective. Rejecting negotiations with Sinn Fein while
violence continued, Sir Patrick offered 'clarification' of how the
nationalist party could be brought into the political process, once the use
of arms was renounced. He thus showed that Britain might be flexible,
without abandoning the principle that a ceasefire must precede serious
talks. Mr Major's weekend reply to a letter from Mr Adams was in the same
vein. This sensible strategy, and the entire Anglo-Irish concordance, would
be enhanced by a removal of the ban on the use of Sinn Fein voices on
British radio and TV, following the lifting of more draconian restrictions
by Dublin.
No-one can expect with confidence that this approach will end IRA attacks.
The UK government should nevertheless proceed with talks on new
constitutional arrangements for Ulster, while taking care to keep Dublin on
side at every step. It is well placed to ask for Mr Reynolds' wholehearted
support for and co-operation with security responses to whatever level of
violence occurs. The Irish government has at last published a bill that
would close legal loopholes in extradition procedures. It can no longer
plausibly defend the possession of certain explosives and weapons as
political offences to which extradition would not apply. Likewise, if
further security measures, even draconian ones such as internment, have to
be considered, Britain and Ireland should act in unison. Whatever Mr Adams
does next, the alliance of purpose between London and Dublin is the most
powerful enemy he has faced.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Diplomatic disquiet: The frustrations caused by cuts and
savings in the Foreign Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was almost a whiff of revolution in the air in Whitehall, when it was
announced last week that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, would
address the massed ranks of his department - at the request of the staff
trade unions.
It is an unprecedented event and could attract as many as 1,000 London-based
staff, who will gather today in the grandiose surroundings of the Durbar
Court, restored to its original Victorian splendour a few years ago.
The fact that Mr Hurd has agreed to address such a meeting demonstrates that
he recognises diplomats may have genuine cause for anxiety, not only about
their career prospects but about the future of the foreign service as a
whole.
Though the damage done to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's reputation
by Mrs Margaret Thatcher's constant sniping and criticism has largely been
repaired by the present govern-ment, financial constraints have provoked
fresh worries.
That does not mean that there is an atmosphere of militancy in King Charles
Street. Most of the staff, and even their unions, concede that Mr Hurd is a
good boss, as well as a good foreign secretary. One or two have even been
heard to say, somewhat rashly, that he is 'the greatest foreign secretary
this century'.
Others, much less flattering, merely consider that he is very successful at
not rocking the boat, but that he has not shown an inordinate amount of
imagination in the formulation of policy. One middle-ranking diplomat, who
refuses to attend today's meeting, said it would be 'just like a journalist
listening to a press release being read out by a Foreign Office spokesman'.
Yet almost everyone agrees that Mr Hurd has done his utmost to defend his
department against the assaults of the Treasury, and that he was
particularly successful in his damage limitation exercise during last
autumn's public expenditure survey.
Nevertheless, in spite of small increases in money terms during the
three-year period covered by the survey, 1993-96, there will be a cut of 11
per cent in real terms in the FCO's overall budget over the period, fuelling
fears of reductions in both posts and staff.
Though the administration says that it does not 'anticipate' reductions of
diplomatic posts 'at the moment', there can be little doubt that this will
happen in the longer run, in spite of the opening of 20 new posts since
1990.
Undeniably, there has been a steady decline in Britain's overseas
representation over the past decade. The FCO's overall manpower fell by 19
per cent between 1980 and 1990, though it has since risen again by some 5
per cent, as a result of the opening of new posts and the introduction of
new visa regimes.
Comparisons with countries of similar size and importance, such as France
and Germany, show that Britain is falling behind. Last year, Britain had 217
posts abroad, compared to France's 291 and Germany's 230. At the same time
Britain's overseas staff of 2,500 was much lower than France's 4,600 and
Germany's 3,200.
Further concern among staff has been caused by the outcome of a recent
management study which showed that the hours being worked by many officials
were far too long - in some senior cases as much as 70 or even 80 hours a
week, instead of the 41 hours for which they are paid.
In addition, a market-testing programme covering 12 internal services has
raised fears that more jobs will be lost or staff transferred. The services
include language training, information technology, research, security,
transport and some aspects of communications, and involve about 15 per cent
of the Foreign Office's staff. In the first year of its operation, the
programme, which opens up these services to competitive bidding by outside
companies, has allowed the FCO to achieve savings of Pounds 6m.
A blockage of appointments to senior grades, caused by the fact that
retirements, usually about 15 to 18 annually, will be much lower over the
next two years, has added to the malaise of a service which recruits only
about 20 'fast-stream' candidates out of more than 2,000 applicants each
year.
It is clear that, even if there is unlikely to be any blood on the elegant
pavement of the Durbar Court, Mr Hurd will nevertheless be unable to evade
answering some delicate nitty-gritty questions. Morale-boosting statements
about the status and continued role of the Foreign Office on the world
stage, though welcome, will hardly be sufficient.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Tokyo, time to compromise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Morihiro Hosokawa became Japan's prime minister last summer, ending
38 years of unbroken rule by the Liberal Democratic party, he rightly
identified reform of the country's corrupt and antiquated political system
as his coalition's principal task. By that yardstick, the defeat of his
electoral reform proposals in the upper house of parliament on Friday
represents a serious setback. It has undermined, perhaps fatally, the
government's cohesion and credibility on the main issue that brought it to
power.
Worse, it leaves Japan floundering without effective leadership in the face
of the most serious economic recession since the second world war and at a
time of mounting US pressures over trade. Vital decisions on stimulating and
deregulating the economy are being held hostage by the row over reform.
Unless it is swiftly resolved, economic confidence will take a further
battering and, as Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, made clear in
Tokyo yesterday, Japan's international difficulties will multiply.
That things have come to this pass is not Mr Hosokawa's fault. His reform
bill had the potential to make Japanese politics cleaner and more
transparent by replacing the current multi-seat constituency system with a
mixture of single-seat districts and proportional representation, and had
been endorsed by the lower house of parliament two months ago. Friday's
failure reflects rather the fissiparous nature of his seven-party coalition,
and in particular the implosion of its largest component, the Social
Democratic party, 17 of whose members crossed the floor to vote with the
opposition LDP. Mr Hosokawa is now in the ironic position of relying on the
power brokers of the LDP itself - the only party which can assure him of a
majority - to salvage at least part of his plan.
Important change
Painful as it may be for the prime minister, a compromise between the
government and the LDP on political reform is both necessary and desirable
before the current parliamentary session closes on Saturday. Such a
compromise is not impossible, for the LDP has proposals of its own. Although
they dilute Mr Hosokawa's plan in various ways calculated to benefit the
LDP, they retain his most important change - that to single-seat
constituencies, which would foster competition between parties on policy
grounds rather than encouraging individual politicians from the same party
to buy votes with cash and favours as at present.
Stagnant economy
It is not just on the electoral system, however, that the government and the
LDP need to reach some accommodation. The stagnant state of the economy is,
if anything, a more pressing case for concerted action. In spite of repeated
promises of an economic stimulus package in recent months, Mr Hosokawa has
failed to deliver, and his coalition now looks less likely than ever to be
able to agree on such necessary measures as a cut in income tax. Neither the
domestic economy nor Japan's trading partners can tolerate further delay.
Here, too, the onus is on LDP leaders to show statesmanship and recognise
their self-interest in lending Mr Hosokawa a helping hand.
There will be those in the LDP who, for ideological or electoral reasons,
oppose such co-operation. But the alternative - an early election under an
unreformed electoral system - would hardly serve a useful purpose. Voters
outraged by the politicians' failure to agree on political or economic
reform would most likely deliver another weak coalition that would simply
prolong the political and economic agony, preside over a further
deterioration in Japan's relations with the US, its most important partner,
and deepen popular mistrust of the political class.
Mr Hosokawa may be a transitional figure in a situation of unprecedented
political fluidity. But the fact that he is one of the few politicians to
whom the general public disaffection does not apply shows that his declared
goals of political reform and economic deregulation are in tune with the
desires of the electorate, as well as with the demands of Japan's
international partners. From them and from his political rivals, he deserves
support in managing an orderly transition to the fresh elections that are
all but inevitable in a few months.

Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, is always banging on about the virtues
of a free press. But not all his officials agree, judging by an unusual
alliance to stop the film premier of the BBC documentary, Chairman Mao: The
Last Emperor in the colony's Foreign Correspondents Club.
It's no great surprise that Xinhua News Agency, China's official mouthpiece,
didn't want the club to show the offending film tonight. But the FCC was
piqued to find the local Hong Kong censor was also being awkward.
Such interference has upset Philip Bowring, the ex-editor of the Far East
Economic Review and FCC president, who opines that Hong Kong's tough
censorship law is an example of the sort of legislation the governor ought
to be repealing, not enforcing. No doubt Patten can be relied upon to turn a
blind eye if he wants to keep opinion formers on side.

Who will get the job of selling Europe to the Brits? The search for a
candidate to run the European Commission's London office is looking
increasingly jinxed; at least one prospective applicant has declined the
offer. The recruitment has stalled thanks to an internal EC argument over
whether to pick an in-house candidate or gamble on an outsider.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator and senior UK
commissioner, believes that spreading the net will ensure the best quality.
Other bureaucrats, notably David Williamson, secretary general, are pushing
for an insider to run the 25-strong London office. So Geoff Martin, the
temporary stand-in, must rate his chances. However, the post has been
unfilled since last May which raises the question of whether it is being
kept open for an unlucky Tory MEP who loses a seat in the forthcoming
European elections. Surely not.

Who should determine the performance-related pay of TSB directors? The

signs are that the UK's sixth largest bank intends to branch out and give

The dear old TSB has introduced an executive bonus scheme which will mean
that the pay of chief executive Peter Ellwood and his top team will be
affected by how the bank's financial performance compares with an average
drawn from a select group of competitors, including Abbey National, Lloyds
and Royal Bank of Scotland.
It may be a laudable attempt to restrain top people's pay at a time when the
banking sector is generating increasingly vast profits. But it does add a
rather random and extraneous element into the calculations. After all, what
good is it to TSB shareholders if everyone else flops in 1994-95?.

FT  24 JAN 94 / A giant burnt by hot metal: Metallgesellschaft's ills
highlight the failings of Germany's system of corporate governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the evening of Saturday December 4, bankers and industrialists gathered
at the home of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, in the
smart town of Kronberg just outside Frankfurt.
The party was to celebrate Mr Pohl's 64th birthday, but the mood turned
sombre when Mr Hilmar Kopper, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank,
mentioned to fellow guests that all was not well with Metallgesellschaft,
Germany's 14th-biggest industrial company.
The day before the party, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the Austrian who was then
Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, had visited Deutsche Bank with an
urgent request for cash to stem mounting liquidity problems at MG Corp, the
company's US trading subsidiary.
That weekend, officials from Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the two
biggest banks in Germany and among the main shareholders in
Metallgesellschaft, put together DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m) of emergency funds to
cover mounting cash-calls triggered by MG Corp's speculative trading in oil
derivatives.
'A technical problem,' is how Mr Kopper described the liquidity crisis a few
days later.
This original assessment proved an understatement. Within weeks, Mr
Schimmelbusch had been sacked, together with his finance director, and four
other board members had left. Metallgesellschaft restated its losses for the
year to the end of September at DM1.8bn and said it may lose at least
DM1.5bn from its exposure in oil-futures markets. This brought the company
to the brink of collapse. Bank creditors recently agreed to fund a DM3.4bn
rescue package for the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial
conglomerate.
A corporate implosion of this scale is rare in Germany. Not since the AEG
electricals group went bankrupt in 1982 has so large a German company come
so close to the edge. 'The whole thing came as a dreadful shock,' said one
banker last week. 'Everybody is asking how it could happen.'
The affair, afflicting a company with annual sales of DM27bn and 58,000
employees is not merely embarrassing. It has prompted an unusual degree of
soul-searching among senior German bankers and managers confronted with a
public demonstration of their own failings.
The story of the company's debacle is a complex tale of one man's
personality and the inadequacies of Germany's system of corporate
governance. At the centre is Mr Schimmelbusch, a Jesuit-educated businessman
who could deflect criticism from older bankers with the same success that he
could charm the foreign financial community. His command of English made him
a favourite with Anglo-American financiers, few of whom remained unpersuaded
by his rhetoric.
When he took the job of chief executive of Metallgesellschaft in 1988 after
15 years with the company, he was regarded as just the man to inject a new
lease of life into what had become a dull operation. 'He was seen as a
Messiah who could at last get things done,' said a senior Frankfurt fund
manager.
He quickly embarked on a bold diversification strategy which took the group
away from its old core businesses of mining and metals into areas such as
environmental technology. The strategy led to an explosion of sales until
1992. But his acquisition spree failed to deliver the immunity to recession
in the old cyclical businesses which it was designed to achieve.
Metals prices fell, triggered by cheap imports from the former Soviet bloc
after the end of the cold war. Losses of DM124m in 1991-92 at Kolbenschmidt,
the car components subsidiary, and of DM290m for the same period at Schiess,
the machine tools offshoot, compounded heavy losses from metals smelting and
mining. Substantial investment in modernising the group's smelting
facilities compounded the misguided strategy. As a result, profits tumbled,
debts mushroomed (the group owes more than DM9bn) and cashflow evaporated.
To generate revenues Mr Schimmelbusch aggressively promoted MG Corp's risky
oil-futures activities in the US. The volume of oil which MG Corp contracted
to deliver on a long-term basis is understood to have increased tenfold to
nearly 170m barrels during the course of last year.
It was a gamble which failed when the oil price turned down, leaving its
hedging strategy exposed as inadequate. 'He was like a juggler who had to
keep bringing more and more balls into the air to keep the public happy,'
said a banker.
Mr Schimmelbusch's ability to keep the act going almost until the last
minute - barely a month before his dismissal his contract as chief executive
was renewed for another five years - highlights at least two important
failures of control.
The first is that Metallgesellschaft's financial control systems failed to
avert MG Corp's adventures in the US oil-futures market, or to provide any
indications of problems until it was too late.
This is not solely an internal issue. As Mr Tyll Necker, president of the
BDI, the Federation of German Industry, remarked last week, increasing
numbers of German industrial companies engage in financial market dealings,
in part to counter weak demand for their traditional products. 'Those
companies which do this sort of thing must be certain that they introduce
tough internal rules, and ensure that they are adhered to,' he said.
The second failure of control is broader: it is that of the two-tier board
system. Under this system, responsibility for a company's affairs is divided
between the supervisory board, in charge of supervising management
performance, and the management board, responsible for the day-to-day
running of the business. In the case of Metallgesellschaft, the supervisory
board did not prevent Mr Schimmelbusch's risky ventures.
Some 35 per cent of the company's shares are owned by Deutsche and Dresdner
banks, Daimler-Benz and the insurer Allianz, all prestigious names in German
finance and industry. Their representatives sit on the supervisory board,
together with a crop of distinguished outsiders. The board is chaired by Mr
Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank head of corporate finance. He has yet to
make any public statement on the affair though a formal company statement
last month said that Mr Schimmelbusch was sacked for failing to keep his
supervisory board informed of developments at MG Corp.
Mr Schimmelbusch's ability to deliberately mislead when his back was against
the wall was demonstrated on Friday December 3, the day he visited Mr
Schmitz with an urgent request for money. Mr Schimmelbusch was asked by the
FT to comment on rumours that MG Corp was in difficulties and that it needed
extra funds. He denied the rumours, adding that the meeting that morning was
routine. He invited the FT to see documentary proof that all was well at the
US subsidiary, but when pressed the meeting never materialised.
Critics of the German twin-board system argue that supervisory board members
are often caught off guard because they enjoy such close relationships with
the managers they are supposed to supervise.
'The position of influence enjoyed by banks on supervisory boards is open to
question as never before,' Mr Otto Lambsdorff, a leading member of the Free
Democratic party and chairman of DSW, Germany's largest small shareholder
organisation, told the FT this week. 'They look after the company's capital
market issues, they advise on mergers and acquisitions, and in some cases
they own big share stakes as well. Is it not surprising that their judgment
as supervisory board members is clouded?'
These comments are pertinent in the Metallgesellschaft case as Deutsche and
Dresdner banks both backed Mr Schimmelbusch's acquisition spree, reaping
plump advisory fees and interest income on loans in the process.
Mr Lambsdorff argues that more supervisory board members should be
independent. To reduce the influence of banks, he would like to limit the
number of different supervisory board seats occupied by one individual from
10 to four, and to ban banks from owning more than 10 per cent of industrial
companies.
Other critics of the board system have suggested alternative reforms:
Professor Ekkekard Wenger, a noted shareholder activist, says that Mr
Schimmelbusch was able to shield the poor performance of the company behind
opaque accounts. Had the true state of operating performance been obvious in
1991-92, as it would under US accounting rules, it is unlikely that Mr
Schimmelbusch would have survived so long as chief executive, he said.
One banker who attended the rescue talks said he hoped that the affair would
act as a catalyst for greater openness in German corporate life. This may be
optimistic. The first reaction of German bankers has been to batten down the
hatches: few details have so far emerged from the boardrooms of Deutsche and
Dresdner banks of the postmortem currently under way.
The big banks' close and extensive links with industry are at the heart of
the German model of corporate capitalism and are unlikley to be relinquished
without a fight. For decades the world has admired this model. But the
Metallgesellschaft debacle has exposed the fault lines at the heart of the
system.

FT  24 JAN 94 / The gas meter cometh . . .: Metering plans will be crucial
to liberalising the UK gas market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent weeks, the gasman has been calling on 1,000 homes in Edmonton,
north London, to fit a little electronic gadget to their gas meters. It is
the first practical step in the revolution which faces the UK domestic gas
market following the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, to abolish the monopoly enjoyed by British Gas.
The gadgets read the meters every six hours and transmit the information by
radio to a nearby receiver from where it is piped into British Gas
computers. The company can thus monitor gas consumption four times a day
rather than, as before, through the three-monthly meter readings.
The gadgets are part of an experiment by British Gas to improve its
management of the UK gas system and cut the cost of reading meters. But they
could help pave the way to the competitive market which Mr Heseltine wants
to develop later this decade. The changes will be pioneering insofar as no
leading industrial country has ever tried to liberalise gas sales to the
extent planned in the UK.
The intention is that, after 1998, every household in the country should be
free to buy its gas from as many as half a dozen competing companies.
Although households will continue to receive their gas through the same
pipes as before (these will still be owned and operated by British Gas),
their supplier will be responsible for injecting enough gas into the system
to meet its customers' demands. The supplier will therefore have to keep
close tabs on its customers' consumption.
One way this could be achieved would be by attaching the Edmonton gadgets to
customers' meters. These are made by Motorola, the US electronics company,
and cost about Pounds 10 each, including installation.
However, British Gas has also been trying to develop a new generation of
meter, which incorporates more sophisticated metering techniques as well as
the reading and transmission capability. Last month it launched a venture
with Gill Electronic, a tiny high technology company which won a contest
held by British Gas to design a meter for the 21st century. One of the main
specifications was that it should be no bigger than a building brick.
Mr Mike Gill, the founder of Gill Electronic, expects his company to be
producing the meters at a rate of about 100,000 a year within 18 months.
'This new technology will bring dramatic changes to the metering industry,'
he says.
He declines to say how the new meters will be priced, but British Gas has
indicated that they should cost about the same as standard meters, or about
Pounds 50 each.
One big - and so far unanswered - question, though, is who should pay to
have the new meters installed? With potentially 18m households involved, the
cost could be immense. Moreover, are the meters even necessary for the free
market to operate?
These questions are a big worry for the independent gas suppliers that want
to break into the domestic market. Their concern is that householders will
think they have to go through the cost and inconvenience of installing a new
meter if they want to change suppliers. This impression might be reinforced
by the fact that people initially had to buy new telephones if they wanted
to use Mercury, the independent competitor to British Telecom. This could
lead to powerful consumer resistance which could block gas market reform.
Mr Mark Petterson, general manager of Total Gas Marketing and chairman of
one of the industry groups looking at free market issues, says: 'There is
not a need for new meters.' He argues that daily balancing of demand and
supply in the gas network can be done by a process known as 'deeming'.
Every household which opted for a new supplier would be 'deemed' to use a
specified amount of gas based on its previous five-year record, and the
independent gas supplier would pipe enough gas into the system to meet the
deemed demand. If there was a surplus or shortfall, this would be corrected
between the supplier and British Gas periodically when the meter was read.
But this is not the way British Gas sees it. The company is worried that it
would have to 'back stop' the market by making up for any temporary
shortfall in supply, even though it could impose penalty charges on
suppliers that fail to supply enough gas.
Mr Nick White, a director of Arthur D Little, the consultancy firm which is
advising British Gas on the transition to a free market, believes the only
equitable way to balance the system is to install automatic metering
equipment in all households. He says that 'deeming' will prove too imprecise
and will lead to arguments between suppliers. These arguments could be
fierce because the UK operates a tight supply system, with only two big
storage areas to provide flexibility.
Mr White says that small suppliers, which are likely to operate on thin
margins, could face large penalty charges if deeming is not sufficiently
accurate to ensure they supply enough gas. In some cases these penalties
might be enough to lead to a company having to withdraw from the market.
Sophisticated meters would also be necessary if the market was to evolve to
the point where an individual household could buy gas from several different
suppliers. A customer might use one supplier in the day time, but switch to
another in the evening because it was offering better peak-time rates. If
so, the meter would have to distinguish between use at different times of
the day, probably based on four-hourly time blocks.
At an even higher level of sophistication, a combined gas and electricity
meter could be programmed to calculate which source of power gave the best
value at any given moment, and switch the home-heating system accordingly.
Since many of the new gas suppliers will be joint ventures between
independent gas companies and local electricity companies, the scope for
joint metering - and meter reading - will be considerable. 'It's early days
yet, and a lot of thought has to go into this,' says Mr Peter Bryant, deputy
chairman of United Gas, which has links with several electricity companies.
However, he does not think that new meters will be an issue in the early
days of the new market. 'May be by 2000,' he says.
Many of the issues to do with the actual operation of the new gas market
will be set out in a new Network Code, which will be debated between the gas
industry and Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the new head of Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, over the coming months.
With her strong penchant for competition, Ms Spottiswoode is not expected to
insist on issues such as metering if they obstruct the free market.
But she realises that metering also raises fundamental issues of competition
which must be cleared up before a liberalised market is introduced. In a
speech last week she noted that the ownership of meters and the right to
read them could convey a commercial advantage to the companies involved.
Another concern is that gas suppliers might use meters as a way of 'locking
in' customers and keeping out competition. Last month, Mr Gregor McGregor,
director of strategic development at Ofgas, put out a consultation paper
which foresaw the market developing with both daily and non-daily metering.
But ultimately, it will depend on how eagerly consumers embrace the novel
idea of leaving British Gas for new suppliers. The independent gas companies
will be setting out to woo them shortly.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK caught between two systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SARAH ATKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to Joe Rogaly's excellent piece ('It is a moral issue',
January 18) I would like to add the following points.
If we now lack national self confidence and self-belief it is because, as a
society, we are fragmented and caught between two conflicting value systems:
modern capitalism and the monarchical state. What we have ended up with
after 14 years of single-party rule is the worst of all worlds: capitalism's
downside - low wages, poor skills, a crumbling infrastructure and vast
extremities of wealth - operating within a constitutional settlement that
serves the interests of an elite, is open to political interference and
inappropriate to the needs of a late-20th century democracy.
The national malaise is therefore more than simply a disenchantment with
politicians. If our institutions are deficient then the need for
far-reaching reform is long overdue. A new constitutional settlement would
not solve all our ills at a stroke but it would begin to create a culture of
citizenship and give us some sense of common purpose and shared identity.

<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Strife in Mexico' (January 20), you fail to mention
that without the Salinas administration's reforms, long-term financial
stability and, therefore, lower-cost, long-term financings would be further
unattainable for the population than they are today. Only in the past
several years has a 15-year business loan or mortgage been conceivable for
any but a small fraction of the population.
With or without democratic reform these measures, secured by international
treaties, will go a long way to enabling the people in Mexico to put food on
their own tables.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rethink building allowance 'defect'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID DAWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a press release of January 13, the government announced that it
proposes to introduce legislation to 'rectify a defect' in the legislation
relating to the allowances attaching to commercial buildings in enterprise
zones and industrial buildings elsewhere.
The supposed 'defect' is that the owner of such a building who becomes
entitled to capital allowances may dispose of a valuable interest in the
property, through a long lease, without a clawback of capital allowances.
However, to anyone with a modicum of financial awareness, that supposed
defect is not a defect at all. Additionally, the fact that investors in such
buildings are able to make such a disposal was specifically recognised by
legislation enacted in 1978 (Section 37 of the Finance Act 1978).
The enterprise-zone allowance is a government subsidy given through tax
shelter. It is, perhaps, ironic that such a subsidy is very often useless to
a person who may wish to occupy a building constructed in an enterprise
zone. They rarely pay full rates of corporation tax. The market, however,
provided an answer. A whole industry has grown up around making efficient
use of tax allowances but this does not comprise a raid on the Treasury. The
arrangements simply ensure that the benefits granted by government are
utilised to subsidise the cost of construction of enterprise zone buildings.
This has a two-fold effect.
First, it means that a building is constructed where otherwise it would not
be. In other words, investors may take a risk where the cost is tax
subsidised. Second, it means that rents, or premiums on long leases, paid by
occupiers are reduced. After all, rents, or premiums, are the method by
which investors recoup their investment. Lower investment costs mean lower
rents or premiums.
Any amendment of the sort announced will not itself stop investments based
on enterprise zone or industrial buildings allowances. It will, however,
make some form of financing more difficult to structure, meaning that
lawyers, accountants and bankers will charge higher fees. The proposed
amendment was announced by Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury but I instinctively feel that this is not his 'bright' idea.
No matter who thought it up, I would urge the government to think again.

no doubt observing my advanced age and strong protest - he said he would let

FT  24 JAN 94 / It's the business cycle, stupid: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slogan 'It's the economy, stupid' is indelibly associated with Bill
Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Yet although it made good sense then
to focus attention on immediate ills, such as high unemployment, such an
approach is now a political liability. The relevant question today is not
the vitality of the recovery (that can be taken for granted, arctic weather
and earthquakes notwithstanding), but where the US stands in that constant
of economic life: the business cycle.
How mature is this cycle? When will the economy run out of capacity and
begin to face inflationary pressures? The question seems daft until you
recall that the US will shortly enter its fourth year of relatively robust
growth. Given that the preceding recession was mild, it is not safe to bet
that the economy will still be strong when the New Hampshire primaries open
in two years.
Some deceleration from the 6 per cent annualised growth of the fourth
quarter seems assured. But given the accumulated momentum, growth may level
off at 3.5-4.0 per cent. Paradoxically, such strength poses risks, warns Mr
William Brown, chief economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank. Calculations
by the Federal Reserve and others indicate the economy's long-run potential
rate of growth is only 2.0-2.5 per cent. Excess capacity is thus
disappearing rapidly: the rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing
industry is already close to the 83 per cent level previously associated
with rising inflation.
And the US labour market is entering the inflation danger zone. Allowing for
demographic trends, Mr Brown reckons a jobless rate (on the current
definition) of about 5.75 per cent constitutes 'full employment' in the
sense that any further reduction in unemployment would cause accelerating
inflation, and thus be unsustainable. The jobless rate has plunged 1.5
percentage points to 6.4 per cent in just 18 months. At this rate of
decline, the US will hit full employment in about nine months.
Once cyclical expansions really get going, they are hard to control. If the
Fed is to prevent inflation rising, it may thus have to tighten policy quite
aggressively. Against conventional wisdom, Mr Brown predicts that Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, will raise short-term interest rates,
currently 3 per cent, by a quarter point before delivering his
Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony in late February. (The conventional
wisdom is that rates will not be raised until March or possibly even
mid-year.)
Thereafter the squeeze will have to intensify: by the end of this year short
rates will be 4.5 per cent, rising to 5.5 per cent late in 1995. This sounds
draconian. Yet although an increase of 2.5 percentage points would probably
put a large dent in equity and bond prices, it would hardly be tough by
historical standards. In the past six business cycles, short rates have
risen by an average of 5.7 percentage points; even if one ignores the
inflation-prone 1970s, the average increase was 3.8 percentage points.
The JP Morgan analysis, however, is only as good as its assumptions. Some
Wall Street economists - for example Mr Bruce Steinberg at investment house
Merrill Lynch - believe industrial capacity is growing much faster than
official figures imply. He also rejects conventional estimates of long-run
potential growth on the grounds that corporate restructuring has raised US
productivity growth.
In his view, productivity is rising at about 1.75 per cent a year against
just under 1 per cent in the 1980s. Since the labour force is growing at
about 1.25 per cent, this means the potential growth rate is now about 3 per
cent. There is thus more slack in the economy than conventional estimates
suggest.
One might add that standard measures of inflationary pressure could be
equally misleading. Most experts (including the Fed) agree that the consumer
price index overstates inflation, which is actually nearer to 2 per cent
than the measured 2.7 per cent. Anxieties provoked by corporate 'downsizing'
and record levels of white-collar unemployment may also mean that the
jobless rate consistent with stable inflation has fallen. At any rate it is
hard to believe that many employees will be bold enough to start
aggressively demanding higher pay in the near future.
It is thus possible that the current upswing could persist for several more
years without generating much inflation. The economic landscape is changing
in fundamental ways. The economic rise of east Asia and the adoption of
market principles in much of the developing world - as well as some formerly
communist countries - represents an historic extension of the global market;
more intense competition should exert downward pressure on inflation in
mature economies, such as the US.
Yet as Mr Brown points out, the extraordinary divergence in business
operating rates in the US and Europe in recent years suggests that national
economies are less integrated than many suspect. In particular, service
sectors (two-thirds of most economies) are largely insulated from foreign
competition. You cannot therefore assume that excess capacity in trading
partners - or competition from the likes of China and Mexico - will prevent
the US economy from overheating.
Since monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, the prudent
course is surely for the Fed to tighten policy quickly and then debate the
existence of a 'new economic order'. Taking the medicine early also makes
political sense. Mr Clinton would surely prefer a modest firming of rates
this year to a monetary crunch while campaigning in 1996.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Performance pay and bargaining rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE CLANCY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Power workers accept merit pay' (January 15/16),
requires clarification. The new agreement for professional and supervisory
staff in Eastern Electricity covers a package of terms and conditions,
including the introduction of performance-related pay (PRP). However, the
statement that the trade union's acceptance of PRP ends our participation in
pay bargaining for this group does not reflect the terms of the agreement.
Performance appraisal categories will determine precise individual
increases, but the product of the trade union's negotiations will be paid as
a minimum to individuals who meet or exceed targets. In addition, we have
secured the right to represent members over objective setting and their
year-end appraisal rating. Indeed, the new scheme does not go into full
effect until 1996; this provides a phasing-in period negotiated by the trade
unions due to our reservations about the efficiency of PRP as a method of
rewarding and motivating professional staff.
It is important that the impression given by the article is corrected, as
too often trade unions are portrayed as unable to come to terms with PRP. We
have successfully combined the protection of collective pay negotiations
with rewards for individual achievement in the PRP system. There is nothing
in this acceptance of PRP that is incompatible with strong trade union
representation into the future.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: Dark and desperate down in the pit - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decline of the British coal industry is one of the most dramatic events
in recent British history. Less than a decade ago, the National Union of
Mineworkers could threaten to bring down a government, and sometimes
succeed. The miners were regarded as the salt of the earth even by former
Conservative prime ministers: buying them off was a price worth paying. And
when Margaret Thatcher stood up to the miners' strike in the mid-1980s, she
was by no means certain the union would be defeated.
By now, there are only about 20,000 miners left and British Coal is on the
verge of being privatised. Here is a play about the coal face, written from
the inside. Mike Cullen's The Cut is the best first full-length work by a
British dramatist for some considerable time. Not only does it break new
ground in terms of subject, it also observes the classical virtue of
confining the action to one place - namely the pit, some 3,000 feet
underground.
There are only four characters, all miners. Daylight is never seen; the
miners shy away from the surface as if it represents a reality not be faced.
That does not mean that it is all solidarity. Politics underground are as
intense as those above. Because of the location, designed at the Bush
Theatre by Suzanne Fields, events are more dramatic.
Cullen was an electrician at a Scottish colliery before he turned
playwright. His knowledge of the industry must be unsurpassed in the
theatre, and the way he draws on it is one of the fascinations of the piece.
The Cut is full of technical detail; without it, it would be a lesser play.
To take a small example, an elderly miner (Sandy) is plainly suffering from
pneumoconiosis; Cullen lets the coughing speak for itself.
The writer has borrowed one incident from the 1984-85 strike. In South Wales
a concrete post was thrown from a motorway bridge on to a taxi taking a
miner to work; the driver was killed. Cullen embroiders this into the wrong
man being jailed for the offence, and another being killed because he was a
witness.
For the rest, however, this is a tale of miners quarrelling with miners, of
the most militant being the first to take the redundancy money when the
strike is lost and others pushing for management jobs under privatisation.
Hessel, the only really unpleasant character, has packed in the union
because the only way to have clout is to act from the inside. By the end of
the play, he is the new under-manager.
The plot is sometimes obscure, and not only because of the heavy Clydeside
accents. There are masses of four letter words. But none of that is a
defect. This is one of the few occasions where the swearing is a natural
part of the language and not a substitute for thought. Being underground may
have distorted the miners' intelligence; it has not necessarily diminished
it.
The Cut is directed by Martin McCardie and performed by a relatively new
Scottish company, Wiseguise Productions. It is a thriller because it takes
some time before the full villainy of Kenneth Glenaan's Hessel emerges.
Earlier one might suspect the equally excellent (but framed) Frank Gallagher
as Salter. Jim Twaddale's McGee is one of those panicky characters in
between.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: Pledge to move back to town - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the man in the street, or on the by-pass, the planning process, which
has such an impact on our everyday lives, remains a great mystery. We all
know that there is a complex, intrusive and defiantly bureaucratic planning
system which, in theory, regulates the shape of our environment.
The system is meant to keep the planning process clean, decent and legal. It
is also meant to reflect the democratic will of Parliament and, through the
complex system of local democracy, reflect the will of the people.
But a glance at the condition of many of Britain's towns and villages shows
that there are other, more powerful, forces at work: economic, political and
market forces.
When Baroness Thatcher was prime minister she had regular private meetings
with property developers, builders and retailers with the aim of simplifying
and speeding up the planning process.
The result was the 1980s boom - the spread of by-passes and motorways and
the over-supply of superstores and offices.
From 1986 to 1992, development was focused on out-of-town locations and as a
result the traditional high street has been under tremendous pressure. As we
park our cars outside the supermarket, there are lingering worries about the
empty shops belonging to anxious traders in the smaller towns. The lower
levels of consumer spending in the past few recessionary years have not
helped and there is no doubt that competition from the shopping centres
built in the 1980s has had a direct effect on the town they 'serve'.
One of the little known aspects of planning is the Planning Policy Guidance
Notes. These notes, known as PPGs, which appear regularly as supplements to
planning Acts and government circulars, set out government policy on
different aspects of planning.
It was 'PPG 6 Major Retail Development', issued in 1988, which seemed to set
the seal of planning approval on the major out-of-town shopping
developments. Now, in an almost complete volte-face, a revised version of
the retail development guidance note has been issued, emphasising the need
to revitalise town centres.
Many will feel that the new guidance is a belated reaction to the
proliferation of new developments: the stable door is being closed long
after the retail runners have galloped all over the kingdom.
The new guidance note does, however, offer a balanced view that would permit
further out-of-town or edge-of-town retail development, providing it does
not affect the vitality *something in here (HP) *
and trading viability of a town centre. There is an implied desire to
encourage development that is accessible by more than one form of transport
 -after all, the 1991 Census revealed that 23.9 per cent of the nation's
households do not have access to a car. Environmental considerations are
also stressed with references to the the need to avoid increases in
car-borne trips in an effort to reduce pollution and congestion.
Mr John Gummer, secretary of state for the environment, made a forthright
and pointed speech at last week's seminar on planning and development
control, organised by the Town and Country Planning Association.
He pledged his help to those who are willing to, 'achieve the quality of
traditional town centres which they value, and put the heart back into
cities'. Good urban design in town centres, he said 'demands vitality in the
urban property market'.
Vitality flows from people's decisions to shop there. In turn that depends
on a positive approach to planning and managing town centres.
It also means discouraging development on green-field sites on the edge of
cities.
'Out-of-town shopping centres require people to travel by car. They deny the
opportunity to make one journey serve several purposes. Business parks on
the by-pass also demand that people drive to work; and having driven to work
they have to drive out for their lunch, or to pick up a few items for their
evening meal. Such developments are derisive - they deny access and choice
to those without a car; they are both car-dependent uses.'
Mr Gummer went on to say that we should learn to see the car as a servant
not as the determinant of the way we build. When it comes to the future of
town centres he was very clear: 'I want to see town centres which serve the
whole community and provide a focus for retail development where the
proximity of competing businesses facilitates competition from which
consumers benefit. I want to see town centres which contain variety and
activity, and in which a whole series of different uses are encouraged.
'Such diversification of use can ensure that the economic activities
reinforce each other, and make town centres more attractive to local
residents, shoppers and visitors. I want to see a range of activities -
entertainment,restaurants and cafes, health and educational activities.
'Towns need to be places where people choose to live, and work and enjoy
themselves. I want to see us improve the quality of our towns so that we can
reduce the pressures of urban sprawl and the development of green field
sites.'
These are stirring and appropriate words for the next decade. But are they
in time to bring about the renaissance of our towns and the improvement in
the quality of urban life that is so necessary?

FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: A dip in the deep end - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new fringe theatre in London, The Bridewell, has opened at the St Bride
Institute at Bride Lane, Fleet Street. It deserves to be a roaring success.
The auditorium is built over a disused Victorian swimming pool - around the
walls is a raised wrought-iron gallery, and above, a glazed roof.
The pool was built in 1893, and was closed in 1972.
Last year, Carol Metcalf and her company, Breach of the Piece, staged Much
Ado About Nothing in the shallow end of the pool, and the idea of a theatre
emerged. After five months' work, Pounds 400,000 from the Institute and some
non-invasive design by Lloyd Leroy Architects, the theatre opened.
The pool itself is now the orchestra pit.
The theatre's owners and governors, the St Bride Institute, are planning
exhibitions and conferences in the space; the theatre's artistic director,
the tireless Metcalf, can offer the theatre for a single early-evening
after-work corporate show or a lunch-time revue (imagine how many people fit
into a 25-metre swimming pool).
The schedule includes Sondheim's Pacific Overtures later this year, but the
Bridewell has opened with Shakespeare.
Julius Caesar gave the world the 'most unkindest cut of them all'; this has
nothing to do with the Lorena Bobbitt case in Virginia, and everything to do
with getting Julius Caesar down to two hours on stage with a small cast.
The result is more a recital than a play.
The essentials of Julius Caesar remain, although the actors need to relax
much more and the action of the play needs to quicken.
The modern dress works well, particularly with video links to the battle
scenes and studio speeches from Brutus and Mark Antony.
The shortened version of the play offers itself as Brutus' tragedy, the
dilemma of a man torn between instinct and judgment: the part is well played
by Clive Paget.
Caesar stays alive long enough to show he is worth killing, Cassius lurks
hungrily throughout, and Casca (successfully cast as a woman) is blunt to a
fault.
Elsewhere, the play depends so much on ceremony (this is where 'standing on
ceremony' comes from) and crowd scenes which are all sweaty nightcaps and
foul breath, that a scaled-down version risks missing the scope and reach of
Caesar's ambition.
In action, this theatre has great potential for large scenes and intimate
moments. But in Caesar the actors occasionally traded lines like water-polo
players tossing a long pass across the pool.
The lighting could also be more focused to divide up the big stage, and the
music should be more martial.
Carol Metcalf directs.
But this is a sound start to what should be a fine new career for the
converted swimming pool.
No jokes about Brutus' line: 'Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept' - that would be too shallow a view of this deep play.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: Roving singers offer new blend of recordings - A
virtuoso display by an amateur choir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Presumably there still are amateur choirs up and down the country which
pride themselves on singing unaccompanied choral music, but we do not hear
much of them on recordings any more. The rise of the professional chamber
choir - a striking feature of musical life in recent years - has put paid to
that.
These new choirs are made up of roving freelance singers, who move from one
group to another as and when they are needed. The singers know each other
well and can re-group into perfectly-blended ensembles on demand. They are
professionals in every sense, each with an accountant behind his or her
shoulder.
Depending on the music being performed, about four of each voice make up a
choir, the altos being women or men as preferred, sometimes a mix of each.
The Sixteen, founded and directed by Harry Christophers, keeps close to that
total, as its name implies. Its altos are all men, sweet-toned, but not
often making their presence felt. Otherwise the choir's singing at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Thursday was clean, accurate, expressive - professional in
the best sense.
At its finest it gave a virtuoso display of what a choir like this can
achieve. The re-issue of the original recordings of Benjamin Britten's
unaccompanied choral works in the past year or two has been valuable as
historic material, but how bumbling they sound by comparison, how
delightfully amateur. Britten wrote brilliant music for choirs and a couple
of Sunday afternoons in the church hall are not enough to get it right.
The Sixteen is engaged on recording all the composer's choral music, which
means the singers have it on the tips of their tongues. The central section
of the Hymn to St. Cecilia whisked past, a model of lightness, as each fugal
entry chased after the one before. The late cycle of medieval lyrics, Sacred
and Profane, is not among Britten's best work, but it sounds far more
convincing when its close-packed dissonant harmonies are sorted out as
clearly as they were here.
For this all-English programme Britten was paired with Purcell. Heard in
close proximity, Purcell is revealed as the more ambitious in his response
to the words. In just a few minutes the anthem 'Blow up the trumpet in Sion'
covers an enormous amount of ground, from brassy choral fanfares to
mourning, to affirmation.
The Sixteen has all this well within their grasp, though Christophers moulds
the music so suavely that his performances can sound over-cultivated. Solos
from within the choir were confidently taken.

The number of scheduled airlines continues to increase in spite of
predictions of another big collective financial loss for the industry for
1993.
Worldwide, 110 scheduled airlines started services last year, while another
84 closed shop, either through failures, withdrawals from scheduled flights
or mergers.
According to a year-end survey by ABC World Airways Guide the net gain of 26
last year was 50 per cent more than in 1992.
Among airlines starting scheduled services in 1993 were the Bahamas-based
Laker Airways, Air 2000 and British World Airlines, two UK carriers which to
date had been exclusively charter, and nine new entrants in CIS states.
Famous names to disappear from the scheduled market include UTA (merged with
Air France), Denmark's Sterling Airways, Nationair of Canada and MGM Grand
Air in the US.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Unsafe passage to the CIS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Internal air travel in the former Soviet Union is fraught with difficulties.
Cancellations, long delays and overloading of flights in some CIS states are
frequent, particularly in the Trancaucasus. It is not known whether
aircrafts are regularly maintained.
Travellers are advised where possible to fly directly to their destination
on an international flight originating from outside the former Soviet Union.
But even this may be disrupted if a threatened strike by Russia's air
traffic controllers goes ahead. The controllers complain that they often
have to work with outdated and unreliable radar and communications
equipment.
Last week a Russian investigation commission said 'an extremely serious
error' by an air traffic controller nearly caused a mid-air collision
between two western jumbo jets over Russia's far east in late November.
Once safely in the former Soviet Union, however, there are now few
difficulties in conducting business in, for example, the oil-rich state of
Azerbaijan, provided you avoid the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and border
areas. The UK Foreign Office says it is safe to travel to Azerbaijan.
Visitors to the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe say they have to cope with a
nightly curfew, rising crime and power shortages. On arrival in Dushanbe
declare all foreign currency and valuable items such as jewellery, cameras,
computers, etc.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel: 'But which one goes first?' - The confusing
choice of trains between London and Gatwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business travellers arriving at London's Gatwick airport now have three
choices of rail service into the capital. In theory, this should make it
easy for weary voyagers to pick the first train heading in their direction.
The reality is sadly disappointing.
The choices are part of the run-up to the UK government's railway
privatisation programme. The Gatwick Express, the non-stop link between the
airport and London's Victoria station is to be privatised this year. It now
faces competition from two divisions of British Rail - Network SouthEast and
Thameslink.
The problem with such variety is that, if it is to be useful, we have to
know that there is a choice, and have enough information to make one.
If you are travelling to Gatwick from central London, a flashing neon
information board at Victoria station tells you which Gatwick Express leaves
next. But what you really need is one that tells you which service leaves
next, regard-less of the operator.
Business travellers leaving the flight arrival hall at Gatwick, on the other
hand, have to make their first choice as they move towards British Rail's
booking hall. Two large posters stand over the entrance; one advertises the
Gatwick Express, the other BR's Thameslink service to the City of London.
Now here is a real, and useful, choice - between travelling on the Gatwick
Express into the capital's Victoria station, with its excellent connections
and proximity to the West End, or making your way via Thameslink to London
Bridge, the City Thameslink station, and then King's Cross for stations to
the north. But by the time you have reached the station booking hall this
choice has probably been lost under an advertising onslaught from the
Gatwick Express.
The booking hall appears to have been decorated for a papal visit. Maroon
banners hang from the ceiling promoting Gatwick Express. The first three
booking windows, inevitably decked out in maroon, are for Gatwick Express.
Beyond those booking windows are the ones for BR's Network SouthCentral
service to Victoria. This service is three minutes slower than Gatwick
Express's, but slightly cheaper.
But what flight-weary travellers are probably most interested in is which
will get them to Victoria first. When trying to buy a Network SouthCentral
ticket, I was told by staff at the booking window that there was a faster
alternative. I was not told I could choose an alternative destination, via
Thameslink, or that the Network SouthCentral train might leave before a
Gatwick Express anyway.
The most useful information in the booking hall is a modest-sized, framed
poster summarising the destinations available, the prices and the frequency
of service. These are displayed by the booking windows - which means that
after queueing for a ticket you may discover you have been waiting in the
wrong place.
Tickets are transferable between the services, but I could see nothing to
inform the average traveller of this. Supplements have to be paid if you
move to Gatwick Express.
So how do the services compare? Gatwick Express's principal advantage is
that it leaves every 15 minutes, and is clearly signposted at both ends of
the journey. The trains are immaculate, with extra room for luggage. The
price is Pounds 8.60, or Pounds 13 for club class (Dollars 12.72 and Dollars
19.24 respectively).
SouthCentral has older stock, is less comfortable and has probably arrived
from Brighton, or elsewhere in the south of England. It can therefore be
quite full. Network SouthCentral plans to run a service every 15 minutes
from May. The price is Pounds 7.50 (Pounds 11.30 first class).
Thameslink currently runs twice an hour, but has plans for more frequent
services. It charges Pounds 7.50 to London Bridge, Pounds 8 to City
Thameslink. The trains are clean, roomy, but not as comfortable as the
Gatwick Express. Thameslink is useful if you want to go direct to the City
of London or to make a connection to the north at King's Cross.
My Gatwick Express from Victoria to the airport was smart, clean and
air-conditioned. At another platform was a Network SouthCentral train, which
was crowded and grimy - but it left first.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Routes for crowd-lover and loner - A city
not built for athletes / Joggers' Guide - Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo is a joggers' nightmare. Parks are few and far between, often dusty
and invariably crowded. Pavements are rare outside the centre. In the summer
the city is so hot and humid it is often uncomfortable to walk, let alone
run.
Yet finding places to jog or walk is not impossible; it just requires more
effort than in many other cities:
The most popular jogging route is in the centre: a 5km circuit, with a
shorter variant. The route is along a pavement around the moat that
surrounds the Imperial Palace.
It is within walking distance of many top business hotels, such as the
Imperial and the Palace, or via Hibiya station on the green Chiyoda subway
line. Often crowded in the mornings, most of the route runs parallel to a
six-lane highway.
Further along the Chiyoda line towards Shinjuku, the best park to run in is
Yoyogi Park in Harajuku, the largest in Tokyo (get off at the Harajuku stop
on the Chiyoda line).
One of the big attractions at the weekend is the variety of Japanese
lifestyles on display, from exotic punks to families in formal kimonos
attending the nearby Meiji shrine.
The more adventurous might want to go further afield. A favourite spot for
walking on a Sunday night is the docks at Shinagawa: ask a taxi driver to
take you to the Shinagawa Futo Wharf. As Japan is such a law-abiding place,
the area is neither patrolled by dogs nor enclosed by barbed-wire fences.
People walk along the dock, a mile round-trip, simply by dipping under a
chain.
The area is deserted. Cranes stretch out towards Yokohama and Tokyo bay as
airliners land at Haneda airport. The best view of Tokyo as a city is framed
beneath the newly opened Tokyo Bay bridge. In the height of summer the docks
are one place where there can be cool breezes.
Another favourite beat is along the tow path of the Tamagawa River, which is
a 25-minute rail journey from the city centre.
Catch the purple Hanzomon line to Futako Tamagawaen. Then walk down the
river towards the exclusive neighbourhood of Den en Chofu. The walk takes
about an hour.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Management: Honesty is the best policy - Tom Farmer,
chairman of Kwik-Fit, offers advice on how to build a culture of integrity /
Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have always believed that most people are fundamentally honest and,
provided they are given the proper opportunity and recognition, they will
give of their best. While there have been occasions when I have been
disappointed, it is a view that has served me well throughout my life. With
the correct recruitment policy and people it is the only approach that you
can take when running a business, whatever its scale.
Honesty is an intangible quality for which it is impossible to legislate.
You can have as many rules as you want but if people choose to break them
then there is little that you can do to stop them. It is the responsibility
of management to create an environment which reduces temptation by having
adequate controls which are sound but not stifling.
The most effective deterrent is to build within the company a culture based
on pride in one's job. Not only will this improve the quality of the service
or product offered, and produce profit, it will mean that an act of
dishonesty becomes a betrayal of oneself and one's colleagues. This culture
must stem from the top down and the attitude of management towards their
people is a vital element in its creation.
I have found that the best results are achieved by treating people as you
would wish to be treated. People must be provided with a decent working
environment and all the facilities they require to do their job. A proper
pay scheme must be in place which reflects their contribution and everyone
should have the opportunity to share in the profits they help to create.
Everyone should know what is expected of them and should have received
sufficient training to enable them to be fully skilled in that task. There
should be opportunities for everyone to develop to the best of his or her
abilities; the promotion prospects and training programmes within the
company should encourage ambition.
Last year we served 4m customers - the majority of which were making a
'distress purchase'. At Kwik-Fit we aim for '100 per cent customer delight'.
It is a standard that we have set ourselves and a promise to our customers
that is the main theme of our advertising on which we spend around Pounds
10m per year.
Unfortunately we do not achieve this in every single case. Two years ago we
were the subject of criticism by a consumer magazine. While we did not agree
with all aspects of their analysis, their findings taught everyone within
Kwik-Fit a valuable lesson. It showed that people who did not follow their
training and the company's procedures could jeopardise the company's
reputation.
This criticism made us review our operating practices. While we had
procedures and training programmes in place we found that they were not
always being carried out effectively.
BS5750, together with Investors in People, identified the areas for
improvement and helped us to plug the loopholes which can arise in any
company's operations. The company which is honest acknowledges where there
are areas for improvement and accepts criticism which can be turned into a
force for good provided proper steps are taken to make change.
We publish our results within 15 working days of the year end. We
established systems to improve our profitability but we have realised other
benefits. Our people know our culture and it is made clear that anyone who
breaks the rules has no place within the company.
We have not always managed to achieve all the things I have outlined above
all of the time. I know that because human beings are fallible, there have
been occasions when someone has been let down - but we try and we keep
trying to develop and maintain our standards. It must be an obsession and
what I would describe as a 'magnificent obsession'. I have found that our
principles form the basis not only for an honest culture but a profitable
business.
Next Monday: Lew Platt of Hewlett-Packard concludes the series with tips on
how to keep close to your employees.

FT  24 JAN 94 / The Monday Interview: Tony O'Reilly's independent standpoint
 -The boss of H. J. Heinz tells of his plans to break into British media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Tony O'Reilly, head of H. J. Heinz, the international food giant, has a
mission statement on his desk these days which has nothing to do with the
importance of brands or the future of the Irish rugby team, subjects he
cares deeply about.
His favourite mission statement at the moment is the one produced by
advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for the founding of The Independent
newspaper promising that it 'should be independent from all groups'. As he
plans his counterattack to the proposition likely to be unveiled this week,
that could make Mirror Group Newspapers a 40 per cent shareholder in
Newspaper Publishing, the loss-making publishers of The Independent,
O'Reilly is placing considerable emphasis on independence.
Selling newspapers is all about perceptions, the former Ireland rugby
international says, and a newspaper sold as independent has to be seen to be
so.
'I have no doubt the only way to have a future (for the Independent), the
only reason for its being depends on it being even more independent,' says
O'Reilly. What will readers think, he asks, if 'suddenly 40 per cent is now
owned by a fairly lurid left-wing paper' although he concedes some say the
Daily Mirror may not now be as left-wing as it once was.
O'Reilly has already made an indicative offer of about Pounds 30m for up to
29.9 per cent of the group. A more formal proposal could be tabled for a
Newspaper Publishing board meeting on Thursday.
That bid is the latest of O'Reilly's attempts to win a slice of the British
national newspaper market. This week will be crucial in determining whether
he wins a seat at the top table of British newspaper publishing, to sit
alongside the international media magnates such as Conrad Black and Ruper
Murdoch whom he regards as his peers.
O'Reilly was fascinated by the launch of The Independent in 1986.
'The Independent represented a breaking of the mould in British journalism.
In presentation and style it provided something new. Not breathtakingly new
but an interesting niche approach to a vibrant market. This was an
interesting brand and one I was personally excited by,' he says.
Now he is determined to take a stake in the newspaper he much admired and
play a part 'in the slow process by which the fortunes of the paper are
mended'. He says is not looking 'for something that is going to be a quick
buck'.
For years O'Reilly has wanted to expand his newspaper interests from his
original base in Ireland and in particular into the UK national press.
International ambitions
Whenever there is talk of a national UK newspaper being for sale, O'Reilly's
name always comes up. He failed in an attempt to buy MGN when a majority
stake of the group was held by administrators. His international ambitions
suffered a setback when he lost out to Conrad Black in the battle for John
Fairfax newspapers in Australia.
'We haven't so much been banging on the door (of UK national newspapers) as
banging on the side door,' says O'Reilly. He is well known to be one of the
most highly paid executives in the world as chief executive of Heinz. He
began his rise to the top when, in his own words, he 'redefined what
agricultural marketing was all about' by launching the Kerrygold campaign
for Irish butter when he was 26.
His background in food does not mean he is without serious newspaper
credentials. With the help of a management team led by Mr Liam Healey,
O'Reilly expanded from his Dublin base to encompass commercial radio in
California, Australian Provincial Newspapers in Queensland (controlled by
O'Reilly family interests), an outdoor advertising business, half of the
cable television business in Ireland and a joint venture with United
Newspapers which produces a hybrid of the Daily Star for the Irish market -
an edition that sells 90,000 a day.
O'Reilly's template for the future of The Independent would involve a spread
of minority shareholders to ensure independence. They would then buy all the
services they needed, such as printing, on the open market.
The would-be shareholder in Newspaper Publishing is not without allies. He
has been approached by another potential investor in the company, a
newspaper group which he declines to name but whose credentials, he says,
are impeccable.
'We have not got another shareholder lined up but we have had an approach,'
says O'Reilly, and suggests that the potential shareholder could be on board
by Newspaper Publishing's Thursday board meeting - the first to consider the
various bids and proposals on offer.
He clearly envisages a continuing role for Andreas Whittam Smith, principal
founder of The Independent. It would probably not be as central as that
being suggested by the consortium Whittam Smith is putting together with
MGN. Under this proposal, existing shareholders El Pais and La Repubblica
would hold 51 per cent with the founders holding nearly 10 per cent. Whittam
Smith would remain editor-in-chief, one of seven directors and possibly even
chairman.
'The reality (on Whittam Smith) is that almost like De Gaulle - L'Etat,
C'est Moi,' says O'Reilly. However, it is thought that he has identified a
candidate who would be brought in to edit The Independent on a day-to-day
basis.
Clear vision
His aim is to have shareholders at Newspaper Publishing with cash,
experience and a clear vision of what The Independent is about. He does not
believe he can be shut out. Mr Ian Hay Davidson, chairman of Newspaper
Publishing, has made it clear that he wants to see at least one alternative
to the Whittam Smith consortium on the table on Thursday.
The Heinz bos says he would be flexible in his approach to the future of
Newspaper Publishing and would be prepared to work not only with the
founders but also shareholders such as El Pais and La Repubblica.
He says that playing rugby for Ireland taught him how to cope with losing.
But that is not something he is prepared to do now. 'Although we will not
make a solus offer for the entire company, we are very very determined,' he
explains. This is a battle he has no intention of losing.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Management: Principles to fasten on to - Trifast is a
pioneer of partnership sourcing. Andrew Baxter reports on the background to
its flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the average hard-nosed stock market investor, laudable concepts such as
partnership sourcing, just-in-time delivery and total quality management
tend to take second place to cash flow, gearing and dividend payments.
But for Malcolm Diamond, managing director of Sussex-based Trifast, they are
three guiding principles for business. After a decade using them, and
persuading customers to work in partnership with Trifast, he is hoping to
convince investors of their importance too.
Trifast is going public next month in a Pounds 15m flotation that will raise
Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m for the company - most of the rest will go to its two
founders, who are cashing in a big part of their stake. The pathfinder
document is due to be released on Wednesday.
In financial terms, it is an unexceptional deal, and Trifast's products  -
some 70,000 different types of industrial fasteners with names like the Binx
Nut and the Hank Rivet Bush - are unlikely to get City types salivating.
But, apart from offering an investment in a barometer of the UK electronics
and electrical industry, where most of Trifast's fastenings end up, it is
also a rare opportunity to invest in a UK pioneer of influential management
ideas.
Diamond, who has worked at Trifast for 19 years and been its managing
director since 1984, talks about them with as much commitment and enthusiasm
as on the subject of the latest technology for putting heads on to screws.
He says the principles are much more than just a philosophical framework -
there is a clear link between their adoption and the financial performance
of the company, which trades as TR Fastenings.
The practice for which Trifast has gained most recognition is known as
partnership sourcing. This involves it becoming sole supplier to a customer,
normally for all its fastener needs, and often supplying direct to the
production line.
With a high degree of trust on both sides, paperwork can be cut to a
minimum, the customers' stock levels can be reduced and Trifast gets the
security of long-term business in return for giving a better overall
service.
Up to this point, partnership sourcing has much in common with another new
approach known as 'fastener management'. In this case a supplier such as
Trifast takes responsibility for all the customer's fastener needs, in line
with the trend towards the contracting out of 'non-core' services.
But the partnership approach goes further, as it leads to a cradle-to-grave
relationship on each of the customer's products. The supplier gets an early
look at planned products so that it can work out its own schedules and make
suggestions to the customers, and also receives early warning of when a
product is to be replaced.
Partnership sourcing has become increasingly important in the information
technology and electronics industry, where short product cycles and the fast
pace of change make such a relationship mutually beneficial - if not
crucial, especially for the supplier. Other fastener companies, such as
Infast, part of Haden MacLellan Holdings, are also developing such
arrangements with customers. Partnership sourcing is also being promoted
more widely by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of
British Industry.
Roger Hardman of James Capel, Trifast's broker, claims partnership sourcing
is part of a virtuous triangle which also comprises JIT and TQM. 'None of
these philosophies is much use without the others,' he says. 'It's all
indicative of an approach that puts the customer first.'
Trifast's involvement with partnership sourcing began a decade ago when IBM
UK wanted to reduce costs by thinning its supplier base. 'They told us we
were an average supplier of fasteners, but our attitudes were better than
average,' says Diamond. 'So we were selected as a guinea-pig - because with
so many types of fastener there is so much scope for things to go wrong.'
Initially staggered by the demands on quality and delivery made by IBM in
return for becoming a single supplier of fasteners, Trifast has now won two
of the computer company's 'market driven quality' awards and gained
sufficiently in confidence to take the concept to other customers.
Diamond likens partnership sourcing to a supermarket which customers use
because of the overall package - the convenience of shopping in one place,
known reliability and quality - even though some individual items might be
found more cheaply by going round several shops in the high street.
The challenge, says Bob Stevens, group quality director, is to convince
purchasing managers to look at overall costs rather than price and to accept
that partnership sourcing can lead to savings even if it does not put money
in their hands. The costs and time involved in repeatedly contacting a batch
of fastener suppliers, asking about price and delivery and choosing the best
deal, are frequently overlooked.
'Very rarely do fasteners exceed 1 per cent of total purchasing,' says
Diamond, 'but the overheads often exceed that.' Once the core relationship
is established, however, there are some useful spin-offs for Trifast. Some
IT suppliers are using the fastener supplier to bring in items such as
cabling and industrial gloves on its regular trips to fill the fastener
bins, says Martin Phillips, director responsible for sales to the IT and
electronics industries.
Partnership sourcing and fastener management have taken off for Trifast in
the past five years, comments Stevens, and it now has 70 customers using
such arrangements. This represents just 2 per cent of its customer base of
3,500, but already accounts for about a third of its annual sales and could
reach half, says Diamond.
For investors, there are two points about such arrangements. First, the
margins on this business are generally higher, says Diamond.
Just as importantly, partnership sourcing 'locks in' the supplier to the
customer, insulating at least part of the business from the vagaries of the
traditional customer-supplier battleground.

<TEXT>
Thomas Oursin is the new secretary general of the European Investment Bank,
the highest staff position at the Luxembourg-based bank, writes Lionel
Barber. His appointment bears the fingerprints of Sir Brian Unwin, former
head of the UK Customs and Excise who took over as EIB president last year.
Sir Brian wants to improve communications with his political masters in
Brussels, and to make sure that the EIB can shape policy as it expands its
lending portfolios and takes a leading role in the European Commission's
strategy to promote economic growth and competitiveness inside the EU.
Oursin, a 63-year-old German who worked at the World Bank, joined the EIB in
1974 and has a reputation for being sociable and skilled at absorbing
briefs. His last job was head of the directorate dealing with operations
outside the EU, such as Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. He replaced
Dieter Hartwich in the post as from January 1.

<TEXT>
Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst, will not seek election to the
company's supervisory board when he retires next year, writes Christopher
Parkes.
His unexplained decision is a departure from German business tradition -
especially strong at Hoechst - whereby top managers normally end their
careers supervising the activities of their successors.
The announcement followed promptly on the heels of a press report on Friday
that present members of the supervisory board did not want him. The report
said his conduct during a series of chemicals leaks and accidents a year ago
was considered to have severely damaged the group's reputation.
During late February and early April 1993, after 10 years clear of
noteworthy accidents or spillages, the company reported almost 20 within
less than two weeks. Hilger was condemned in the German media as an
'insensitive technocrat' after he blamed fate for the 'statistical
frequency' of the accidents, which resulted in one death.

FT  24 JAN 94 / People: Buba's new baby banker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerd Hausler, one of only two candidates ever to pull off a 'one' in the
tough apprenticeship exams for fast stream Bundesbank officials, seldom
fails to make an impression, writes Katharine Campbell. So it comes as no
surprise to German central bankers that, at the tender age of 42, their
smooth-talking colleague is expected to succeed Gunter Storch in the
council's seven-man directorate when Storch retires at 68 next month.
Hausler would be the most youthful director ever - Helmut Schlesinger, Buba
president until last October, was hitherto the youngest when he was promoted
at 48. With his fluent American and French and his bulging international
contacts book, he should also inject a cosmopolitan air into council
proceedings.
As well as showing talent in the bank's basketball team, Hausler worked for
most of the 1980s as the then president Karl Otto Pohl's personal assistant.
A veteran of the international department, he had also earlier had a spell
at the Bank for International Settlements as pa to Gunther Schleiminger, who
was general manager. He has run the main credit department since 1990.
Closely associated with the Free Democratic party, he is also a natural
replacement for the similarly aligned Storch, thereby maintaining the
tradition that one member of the directorate is of liberal persuasions.
With the approval of the Bonn cabinet already secured, formal confirmation
of the appointment now appears to rest only on the signature of Germany's
president Richard von Weizsacker.

FT  24 JAN 94 / People: Cheung - leading light in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden death of Michael Gale understandably overshadowed another
announcement Hongkong Telecommunications made last Wednesday - the
appointment of Linus Cheung, 45, as the company's chief executive from May
1, writes Simon Holberton.
Cheung (or, Cheung Wing Lam as he is known in the Chinese-language press)
was, until his appointment, the most senior Hong Kong Chinese executive with
Cathay Pacific, the Swire-controlled international airline based in Hong
Kong. Earlier this month he had been made deputy managing director of Cathay
with responsibility for the airline's worldwide commercial activities.
Cheung's rise at Cathay - which, like most other British-owned companies in
Hong Kong, is dominated by expatriate managers whom nice young girls would
be happy to introduce to their mothers - is due in no small part to the
business skills he displayed in developing Cathay's business in Taiwan.
Former colleagues in business and government - Cheung did a two-year
secondment at the Hong Kong government's policy unit, or 'think tank', in
the late 1980s - describe him as a highly polished performer. Indeed,
'smooth' is an adjective most often used to describe him.
He is 'totally user-friendly in a cosmopolitan world', in the words of one
former colleague. 'He is a highly motivated almost restless commercial man
with a genuine sense of social responsibility.'
Cheung is a leading representative of the post-war 'Hong Kong generation' -
born and brought up in Hong Kong, many of the brightest came to notice at
Hong Kong University in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His contemporaries
are now leading lights in local politics, the law and business.
But with his appointment to the top of the pile at Hongkong Telecom Cheung
can claim to have outshone them all.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Cleveland carve-up sets off election row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh controversy has grown from last week's decision to replace Cleveland
County Council with four unitary authorities. The argument is over whether
elections for the four should be held in May this year or next.
The new councils will come into being in April next year and will have the
same boundaries as the present four districts. The argument about the
election date has split local parties. Cross-party district councillors tend
to favour delaying elections until the new unitary authorities are in place
next year.
But some county councillors believe that district representatives who expect
to start handling county work soon should seek a mandate from the electorate
as soon as possible.
District councillors will play an important role between now and April next
year in determining how their authorities absorb the roles of the doomed
county council, including education and social services. The council has
21,865 employees and a Pounds 404m annual budget.
County council Tory group leader and Middlesbrough district councillor Mrs
Hazel Pearson, who is 'sad and disillusioned' by the government's handling
of the reorganisation, said: 'It would be totally wrong that a council
elected at district level takes on the mantle of a county role without going
to the electorate.'
Cleveland's Labour leader Mr Paul Harford agrees. 'People who are going to
dictate the level of services should put their manifesto to the electorate
before, not after,' he said.
Mr Bryan Hanson, Labour leader of Hartlepool district council, said: 'We're
always getting new duties to perform, like Care in the Community last year.
I see this as us recovering those duties we lost in 1974 (the last
reorganisation). Whether we have elections before or immediately after is
irrelevant.'
The timing of elections in Cleveland has wide implications as it is the
first mainland county on which a reorganisation decision has been made.

<TEXT>
At least one of the chefs working for Town &amp; County Catering used to be in
the army Catering Corps. Cooking for the troops amid exploding shells on the
Falkland Islands was, he admitted, 'good training' for what he was
undertaking last night.
For at Earls Court in London, 5,410 guests assembled for the UK's biggest
sit-down dinner since 1925.
Then, it was a gathering of 8,000 freemasons at nearby Olympia in the
presence of Albert, Duke of York - later King George VI - at the Masonic
Million Memorial Fund dinner, held to raise Pounds 1m to build the
Freemasons Hall as their headquarters and a memorial to masons killed in the
first world war.
Yesterday was a more 1990s occasion: a corporate junket for worldwide
distributors and agents of agricultural machine producer New Holland, a
joint venture between carmakers Ford and Fiat. The catering budget alone was
'well into six figures', with the total cost undisclosed.
If that might have left Prince Albert bemused, then last night's
entertainment certainly would - US singer Ray Charles, performance artists
on stilts and bungee jumpers suspended from the ceiling illuminated by a
laser show.
He might have been more at home with the menu. Diners last night enjoyed
salmon, chicken consomme, beef forestiere with vegetables and new potatoes,
British and Italian cheeses, and pears in filo pastry. The freemasons in
1925 sat down to a dinner of salmon with cucumber, lamb Victoria, chicken
garnished with tongue, York ham, tutti-frutti ice cream and gateau.
Last night's dinner took on the air of a military operation. As Mr Stephen
McManus, divisional director of Town &amp; County, explained: 'It's all down to
logistics and communication. For an event like this to be a success, it
comes down to the planning.'
It took a year of planning to assemble 450 tables, laid with 10,000 items of
linen, 135,000 pieces of cutlery, china and glassware, surrounded by 5,410
chairs, and served from eight mobile kitchens. It also took a touch of
military discipline to prepare 50,000 canapes, 370 gallons of consomme, 1
tonne of salmon, 1.4 tonnes of beef, 5,500 stuffed pears, 9,000 petits fours
and 10,000 bread rolls.
Mr Malcolm Emery, who headed the team of 128 chefs and 800 serving staff, is
used to feeding 38,000 people a day as head of catering at Wimbledon, but
even he had served only 2,500 at one sitting before. 'This is the biggest
thing I've done in 20 years,' he said.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Banham attacked over council plans: Controversy dogs reform
proposals in north-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission is expected today to recommend the abolition
of Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils and the retention of
Lincolnshire.
Sir John Banham, commission chairman, faces widespread opposition to his
proposal to create three new local-authority areas, to be called 'Ridings'
even though they will not correspond to the long-standing North, East and
West Ridings of Yorkshire that were abolished when Humberside was created in
1974.
In Lincolnshire, he is expected to confirm his provisional recommendation
that the two-tier status quo, with a county council and eight smaller
district councils, should be maintained, in spite of guidance from Mr John
Gummer, the environment secretary, that he expects all-purpose unitary
authorities to be created.
The Association of District Councils will call for Mr Gummer to reject the
option, suggesting that smaller unitary authorities could be created.
Hull and York would become unitary authorities under the plans for north of
the Humber.
Local Conservative MPs have attacked the 'Riding' label, as the old Ridings
included large tracts of the county, including Leeds, Kirklees and
Sheffield, which are now run under metropolitan authorities.
The original proposal for the North Riding - which was to include Richmond,
Northallerton and Scarborough - was denounced as 'Shambleshire' by the
Association of District Councils on the grounds that it would be
unmanageably big. The East Riding was to include Beverley, Goole and Selby,
while the West Riding would be based on Harrogate and Skipton.
Sir John also faces calls from Cleveland for his resignation
after it was revealed in a local newspaper that he had told the
Plymouth-based Western Morning News that he favoured the idea of one large
unitary council for Cornwall.
Sir John, a Cornishman, said that if a county-wide Cornwall council were
abolished, 'the representation of Cornwall would go by default and it would
more difficult for Cornwall to punch its weight in the south-west'.
Mr Ronald Allan, editor of the Middlesbrough-based Evening Gazette, which
has campaigned against Sir John's proposal that Cleveland should be split
into four unitary authorities, pointed out that Teesside's population was
almost identical to Cornwall's. He said: 'The fact that Sir John has used
the arguments that he rejected for Teesside to push the case to retain
Cornwall as a county shows that there is absolutely no logic to this whole
commission.'

The Treasury is to sell Forward, the troubled civil service catering agency,
to Sutcliffe Catering Group, a subsidiary of the Granada leisure group.
Sutcliffe has an annual turnover of Pounds 370m and employs 20,000 staff. It
already has about 2,000 contracts to provide catering services to public and
private sectors. Forward's turnover for 1993-94 is expected to exceed Pounds
30m.
The privatisation of Forward follows the discovery by the National Audit

FT  24 JAN 94 / Radio 2 may be moved to Midlands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The BBC is considering moving the headquarters of Radio 2 to Birmingham from
central London. It would be the first time that a national BBC radio network
has been based outside London, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Radio staff were told last week that Mr David Hatch, chief adviser to Mr
John Birt, the BBC director-general, would be carrying out a feasibility
study. Mr Hatch is a former managing director of BBC Radio. The decision
reflects growing attempts to move programme production outside London.
The BBC will give details today of its new combined news and sports service,
which will be called Radio 5 Live to reflect its new task of covering the
latest breaking news and sports stories.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Builders fear lost business from stamp duty changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to stamp duty rules announced in the Budget are causing alarm among
housebuilders and commercial property companies, which fear that deals
currently being concluded may be disrupted.
Accountancy firm Price Waterhouse says the changes will mean that, for the
first time, stamp duty will be applied fully to part-exchange house sales,
land swaps between builders and internal leases agreed between parent
companies and subsidiaries.
Until now stamp duty on exchanges of property or land has been levied only
on cash paid to make up the difference in the value between the properties.
With the threshold for stamp duty set at Pounds 60,000, this has meant that
little or no duty was paid.
Price Waterhouse claims that the Pounds 70m the Treasury has estimated it
will raise in 1994-95 is small compared with the disruption and extra costs
to industry from additional property valuations.
The Law Society has written to the Inland Revenue seeking clarification of
the changes, which have already come into effect. It wants any subsequent
modification of the rules by parliament to be backdated to allow companies
and individuals to reclaim stamp duty paid unfairly.
About Pounds 55m of house sales involve part-exchange deals. The
Housebuilders Federation fears that some purchasers who had not expected to
pay stamp duty will pull out or seek to renegotiate terms.
The changes will also affect land swaps, in which builders with too much
land in one region exchange with a builder with excess land elsewhere.
Mr Roger Humber, director of the Housebuilders Federation said: 'These
transactions do not create any immediate profit for the companies but
improve the efficiency of the industry. Any subsequent gain can be taxed in
the normal way when properties are sold.
'Stamp duty on part-exchange house sales will raise only Pounds 3m but will
add an unnecessary complication to transactions.'
The British Property Federation is concerned that companies which negotiate
leases with subsidiaries for 'good internal accounting reasons' will be
penalised by having to pay stamp duty on these deals.
It says companies renegotiating terms of lease arrangements will have to pay
stamp duty on the full market value of the building even though there has
been no change in ownership or occupation.
Mr Don Draper of Price Waterhouse said: 'The government may find it has no
alternative but to withdraw the proposals.'

FT  24 JAN 94 / Power industry decision delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry's regulator, needs
extra time to decide whether to refer the power generation industry to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
He originally hoped to reach a decision in the middle of this month, and
last week electricity stocks gained sharply in anticipation of a deal. But
an announcement now seems unlikely before next month.
Last week Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asked Prof
Littlechild to brief him on progress. The absence of a decision is one of
the factors holding up the government's planned review of the nuclear power
industry. The terms of reference for that, which were due in December, also
face a delay until next month.
The hold-up is due to the difficulty in hammering out an agreement with
National Power and PowerGen, the two largest generators, over prices and
commitments to offer for sale generating plant that is not needed. In
December Prof Littlechild said he would have to settle these issues if a
reference were to be avoided.
Prof Littlechild also said in December that he wanted to discuss plans for
reforming the electricity pool - the wholesale electricity market whose
complex arrangements have been blamed in part for rising electricity prices.
But apart from an exchange of letters last month, nothing has happened.
The threat of a monopoly reference is one of the biggest uncertainties
currently facing the electricity industry. However, analysts are
increasingly confident that a deal can be reached, particularly now that
large energy users have said they do not think a monopolies investigation
would be useful. Lex, Page 14

FT  24 JAN 94 / Half of dairy farmers join co-op
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost half the 28,500 dairy farmers in England and Wales have now signed to
join Milk Marque, the farmers' co-operative which is to be formed from the
Milk Marketing Board.
The board, the monopoly buyer of milk for distribution and processing for
more than 60 years, meets the government today to complete changes to its
plans to turn itself into Milk Marque.
Government objections to its original plans have set back introduction of
competition to the market from April to August or October. But Britain's
largest dairy companies are already scrambling to secure milk supplies
before the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales becomes a
competitive free-for-all.
Many companies are promising farmers higher prices for their milk, which
could lead to a rise in the price of the doorstep pint. But many farmers
believe they should stick together in the face of the powerful dairies.
Mr George Harrison, a dairy farmer from Clifton in Cumbria, said: 'By
joining Milk Marque, I was thinking that as farmers we'd all hold together
and that way keep our power. But there's always a small minority that think
otherwise and go for the extra money.'
Mr Chris Wood, a neighbouring producer, is one of the dairy farmers
attracted by the extra cash. He plans to sell his milk to a cheesemaking
plant in Appleby which is run by Express Dairies. Express has offered him a
premium above the price paid by Milk Marque, giving him an extra Pounds
2,000 in the first year.
With milk supply in England and Wales limited to 85 per cent of the market's
needs by Brussels quotas, dairies will have to pay more money for their
supplies in the free market - the current system for setting wholesale
prices keeps them artificially low.
Low wholesale prices have led to widespread overcapacity in the dairy
processing industry - estimates put it at between 30 per cent and 60 per
cent. Intense competition for milk supplies is expected to see the closure
of many processing plants.
Mr Richard Atkinson, another Cumbrian dairy farmer, said that is why he has
decided not to tie himself to the local Appleby plant, but is leaning
towards signing with Nestle. 'Nestle has enormous financial backing and has
a strategy of concentrating in the UK and Holland - you're assured of a
market,' he said.
While the shake-out in the industry is likely to favour the bigger, stronger
dairies, producers fear the days of the smaller farmer are also numbered.
Since transport costs make up the bulk of the expense of handling liquid
milk, it is more economic for the dairies to send tankers out to the bigger
farmers rather than make many small collections.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Brian Redhead - Voice of Today: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has often been said (mainly by its producers, admittedly) that the Today
programme on BBC Radio 4 sets the day's agenda for politicians and
journalists alike. Any truth in this should be credited chiefly to Brian
Redhead, who died yesterday at the age of 64.
A scholarship boy from Newcastle upon Tyne, he joined the Manchester
Guardian when he came down from Cambridge, and rose rapidly to become editor
of its sister paper, the Manchester Evening News. When he left in 1975 to
succeed Robert Robinson as presenter of Today, the breakfast programme was
mixing news and entertainment.
It was Redhead as much as a new generation of producers who turned it into
the grittier all-news programme which was sought out by Cabinet ministers
wishing to catch the ear of the prime minister early in the day. Baroness
Thatcher, who was a dedicated listener, said yesterday: 'The breadth and
depth of his knowledge were quite outstanding, and I always enjoyed being
interviewed by him.'
Mr John Major said: 'I shall remember him for his feisty interviewing style
and the ever-present twinkle in his eye. He will be greatly missed.'
Redhead said the job was 'the best in journalism'. Just before 5am in the
Today office you could always hear him coming: he whistled all the way down
the long corridor from the lifts. It irritated some of his colleagues -
which only encouraged him, as did their grumbles about his intellectual
arrogance. They could not deny that he was well-read, quick, politically
astute, and could handle any interview at the drop of a hat.
His main interest outside journalism was religion. Yet it was only after
William, one of his four children, was killed in a car crash when he was 18
that Redhead became a regular churchgoer. He was due to retire this year
from Today and there had been talk of his then taking holy orders although
he recently denied this.
He leaves a widow, Jenni, two sons and a daughter.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Offence of 'racial violence' proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of a new criminal offence of racial violence is proposed today
by the Commission on Social Justice.
Racial discrimination, says the commission, is a barrier to social justice
in Britain and a specific offence of racial violence is one of the measures
required to combat it.
The commission, which was set up by Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader,
also calls for the law against incitement to religious hatred in Northern
Ireland to be extended to the whole of the UK. It urges action to prohibit
employers from rejecting job applicants because of their religious
backgrounds.
The Commons home affairs committee is conducting an investigation into
racial attacks and is considering the value of a specific criminal offence
of racial harassment. Even if it recommends creating one, however, the
government is unlikely to do so.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, told the committee last week he was
not persuaded that the case for an offence of racial harassment had been
established. He said the courts could already take all relevant factors into
account when passing sentence under existing law, and the main problem was
the difficulty which the police often faced in identifying those responsible
for racial attacks.
Mr Howard said that if it could be shown that any changes in the law were
needed, he would prefer to amend the existing Public Order Act rather than
introduce a new offence.

FT  24 JAN 94 / C&amp;W to invest Pounds 27m in undersea cabling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, is to invest about
Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) in a new undersea cable system for the eastern
Caribbean, in a significant upgrading of its long-distance capacity in the
region.
The system, 1,730km long, will link 14 islands in the eastern Caribbean from
the British Virgin islands in the north to Trinidad in the south.
It will provide a platform for the region's telecoms needs for the
foreseeable future, underlining C&amp;W's long-term commitment to the region.
The cost of the system is expected to be Dollars 60m. France Telecom and
AT&amp;T, the US long-distance operator, will take initial investment shares of
18 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. C&amp;W's initial share is 66 per cent
of the Dollars 60m project.
C&amp;W has 29 businesses across the Bermuda, Caribbean and Atlantic region. Its
main holding is a 70 per cent stake in Telecommunications of Jamaica, which
made pre-tax profits of USDollars 44.8m last year on revenue of USDollars
175m. It has a 75 per cent stake in Barbados Telephone Company and an
exclusive franchise in Cayman.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Clarke says Iraq case claim is 'tosh'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday dismissed as 'tosh' and 'outrageous' claims that
he had conspired with other ministers to suppress evidence in the failed
Matrix Churchill case.
The chancellor said that if the Scott inquiry stated he had suppressed
evidence in the Matrix Churchill case, 'I would carry on protesting my
innocence but I would resign'.
Speaking two days before Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is due to
give evidence to the inquiry, Mr Clarke said: 'The suggestion of conspiring
with ministers to suppress evidence to see that innocent men are convicted
is outrageous.
'It is, I suggest, tosh and far removed from anything you could picture.' He
told BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme that the allegations had caused
him 'more annoyance than anything else in my political career'.
Mr Clarke was one of the ministers who signed certificates seeking to
prevent secret government documents being made available to the defence in
the Matrix Churchill trial.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Britons show up poorly in charity survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's notion of itself as a philanthropic nation that gives generously
to charity is challenged by an international study published today.
It shows that, while a majority of Britons make donations to charity, the
amounts they give do not bear comparison with donations made overseas. A
British charity supporter donates an average of only Pounds 2 per month -
one-sixth of the amount of a US counterpart, and far lower than Canadian,
French or Spanish donors.
The survey, the first international comparative study of giving and
volunteering, illustrates the seriousness of the dilemma facing the British
voluntary sector. It is coming under increasing pressure to provide
additional services while the public still finances charities with small
change.
The British are far more likely to contribute relatively small amounts than
donors in any of the other four countries surveyed: 19 per cent of British
donors give less than Pounds 1 per month, compared with only 2 per cent in
Canada and France, 4 per cent in the US and 8 per cent in Spain. While 11
per cent of British donors are shown by the survey to give more than Pounds
10 per month, they are overshadowed by 28 per cent in Canada, 26 per cent in
the US and 21 per cent in Spain.
The bright spot in the findings for British charities is that the proportion
of the population donating to charity - 65 per cent - was the highest of any
of the countries surveyed except Spain, where the results were influenced by
large numbers of people buying tickets for charity lotteries. But although
only 27 per cent of the French population had made a recent charitable
donation when the survey was conducted, the average amount given was Pounds
10.10.
One explanation for the disparity may be that street and door-to-door
collections remain the most common way of raising money from individuals in
Britain. French donors are more likely to respond to advertisements or
appeal letters.
Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the Charities Aid Foundation which
co-ordinated the research, said that while giving to good causes was a
strong and established part of the British culture, the results suggested
that 'we do not value the role played by charities to the extent that some
other countries do'.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Midlands business warns on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders in the Midlands have warned Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that the tax increases taking effect in April could choke
economic recovery unless they are balanced by a cut in interest rates.
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of the West Midlands regional council of the
Confederation of British Industry, said: 'The anticipated cut in interest
rates is necessary to make sure that the tax increases don't dampen down
consumer confidence.'
Mr Geoff Nicholls, chairman of the East Midlands CBI, said that if the new
taxation had the effect of cutting the public's confidence then it would
halt recovery.
Although the business chiefs agree that there is steady growth in the
economy, in the east Midlands there is concern about the rise of sterling to
around DM2.60. This provides, in Mr Nicholl's view, further justification
for a cut in interest rates. 'Our worry is primarily that, if we keep them
high, the pound will stay high.'

that their future lay with 'the rest of the Irish people', Tim Coone and
David Owen write.
Interviewed on RTE Radio in Dublin, Mr Adams said that if the government did
so, Sinn Fein would be 'flexible' and would seek 'a peaceful development
towards an accord which everyone can give allegiance to'.
His remarks dealt a further blow to faltering hopes of peace because such a
move would require an unlikely climbdown from the government. Ministers have
consistently said they will not join the ranks of the 'persuaders'.
Yesterday's comments came as the Loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster
Freedom Fighters, said it carried out Saturday's two fire bomb attacks on
stores in Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland.

FT  24 JAN 94 / London hospitals to learn fate next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Decisions on the future of some of London's best-known hospitals have been
deferred until next month.
An announcement had been scheduled for this week, but work on a final
package to be presented by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is
continuing.
The government is committed to cutting hospital beds in the capital and
shifting resources to family doctor and community services. But complex and
politically sensitive considerations are involved. If a package is agreed
this week the announcement is now likely to come around February 2 but it
could be delayed further.
One of the most controversial decisions involves Guy's and St Thomas'
teaching hospitals. Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Trust Board was asked to consider
ways of locating all services at one hospital, but it responded with a
proposal to retain both sites.
Since the trust board made its recommendation in November, it has been asked
by the government to evaluate further possibilities including single-site
options. Among these have been the possibility of housing the hospital at St
Thomas', and moving King's College medical school to Guy's buildings.
Studies have shown that a combined Guy's and St Thomas' hospital could be
accommodated on either site but the trust board does not believe sufficient
capital funding would be available to achieve this. A twin-site solution is
therefore a strong possibility although several options remain before
ministers.
Another sensitive decision concerns the future of the Royal Marsden cancer
hospital's Chelsea buildings. A government-commissioned review of specialist
services has recommended a transfer to a site at Sutton, Surrey. This
provoked a powerful campaign to keep the Royal Marsden in Chelsea and a
decision to close it would court unpopularity for the Conservatives ahead of
May's local elections in London.
Some health service managers believe single-speciality hospitals such as the
Royal Marsden will not prove cost-effective in the new contract-based
internal market. An option for ministers would be to defer a decision,
leaving the market to decide whether the Royal Marsden has a future at
Chelsea.
The forthcoming decisions do not only concern hospitals facing possible
closure. Others risk the removal of services which could make them
uneconomic in the internal market.
The trust board of St Mary's, Paddington, has told the government that
proposals to withdraw its cardiac services would lose it Pounds 6m, or 6 per
cent of turnover, and another Pounds 2m in private patient fees - 28 per
cent of private-wing income. The hospital says that health service cardiac
surgery has risen from 440 to 660 cases this financial year and is forecast
to rise to 750 next year.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Tories find low-tax flagship not so watertight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It never rains but it pours. The government must feel as exposed to the
political downpour as the British people have been to the weather. Now the
reputation of the Tories as the low-tax party is being swept away by the
flood.
A written parliamentary reply released on Friday by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the
financial secretary, showed that in 1994-95 a single man on average pay will
lose 28.6 per cent of earnings in income tax and national insurance
contributions, up from 27.6 per cent in 1992-93. If value added and other
indirect taxes - but neither the community charge nor council tax - are
included, then the total burden upon that same man will be as high as 41.4
per cent of income in 1994-95, up from 39.8 per cent in 1992-93.
How will the burden in 1994-95 compare with that in 1978-79, the last year
the Labour party was in power?
Badly, is the answer. In that year the burden of income tax, national
insurance, VAT and other indirect taxes upon a married man with two children
on average earnings, for example, was 32.2 per cent of income. In 1992-93 it
was virtually the same, at 32.7 per cent, but by 1994-95 it will have jumped
to 35 per cent.
For a married man on three-quarters of average income the increase will be
from 27.4 per cent of income in 1978-79 to 31.2 per cent in 1994-95. But, in
keeping with Tory philosophy, the rise will be smaller for someone on 1 1/2
times average earnings, from 36.1 per cent of income in 1978-79 to 37.7 per
cent in 1994-95.
Still more pain is to come. Chancellors Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke
have raised taxes in 1994-95 by Pounds 8.4bn (1 1/4 per cent of gross
domestic product) above their level in 1992-93 (from an indexed base). Only
these increases are reflected in the above calculations. But between 1994-95
and 1996-97 a further Pounds 8bn in extra taxes is to be imposed.
The proper start for discussion of the fiscal burden is not with taxation,
but spending. In the short term governments may borrow, rather than tax. In
the long term, revenue will have to be raised, either to service debt or in
the form of the inflation tax.
General government spending - excluding privatisation proceeds - is forecast
to be 43 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The share was virtually identical,
at 44 per cent, in 1978-79. It is hardly surprising that overall tax burdens
in the two years are also similar, with non-North Sea taxes, social security
contributions and community charge, as a share of non-North Sea GDP, at 34
3/4 per cent in 1978-79 but forecast at 35 1/2 per cent in 1994-95.
Comparisons of just two years will not do. A peacetime spending peak was
reached, under Labour, at 49 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1975-76: the figures for
1978-79 followed subsequent spending cuts. The post-1975-76 trough was
reached under the Tories in 1988-89 at 39 1/4 per cent of GDP: the forecast
for 1994-95 reflects subsequent sharp increases.
This gives some credibility to the Conservative argument that it is the
low-spending and therefore the low-tax party. But an increase in the ratio
of public spending to GDP of almost six percentage points in five years also
discredits that claim.
In 1994-95 the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast at 5 1/2 per
cent of GDP, down from 7 3/4 per cent in 1993-94. In 1978-79 the PSBR was
the same. So, almost identical spending burdens should result in similar tax
burdens.
Indeed, they do. But the overall tax burden is expected to be slightly
higher in 1994-95 than in 1978-79. One reason is the changed structure of
general government receipts. In 1978-79 9.4 per cent of government revenue
was not taxes, but 'other receipts'. This category is forecast to be down to
6.4 per cent by 1994-95. The government has lost income from rent, interest
and dividends, which has fallen from 8.6 per cent of general government
receipts in 1978-79 to 3.8 per cent in 1994-95, in large part because of
privatisation.
This is a minor point. If spending and deficits are the same, taxation is
almost entirely a matter of shifting taxes around.
The share of income tax in receipts has been falling, but that of social
security and indirect taxation - particularly value added tax - has been
rising. Marginal rates of income tax have been falling, but the value of
allowances has been sharply eroded. As a result of these changes, the burden
of taxation on income has also been shifted from those on higher incomes.
Even between 1992-93 and 1994-95 a married man with two children on 10 times
average earnings will see the burden of his income tax and national
insurance rise only from 37.3 to 37.7 per cent of income.
During the period of Conservative government, the tax burden has been
shifted from visible to less visible taxes and from more visible forms of
income taxation to less visible forms of income taxation. The attention paid
to the basic rate of tax has been the outstanding example of this technique.
Lowering the marginal rate while sustaining the average rate of tax is good
for incentives. But the overall tax burden can be lowered only if the burden
of spending is also reduced. It may be cheeky for Labour to complain, since
it has also protested incessantly about all the spending 'cuts'. But how can
the Conservatives respond convincingly? They are, after all, not supposed to
be the party of high public spending.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Smith keeps focus on big prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith would be delighted if tomorrow's Commons debate on the finance
bill implementing Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget ended in government
defeat. And he would be overjoyed by a strong Labour showing in this year's
local and European elections.
But the big prize from which the Labour leader's eye will not be diverted is
victory at the next general election. That is the context in which the
deepening political row over tax should be seen.
Of course, Labour whips would welcome with open arms any Tory rebels in the
vote on the government's proposals to impose value added tax on domestic
fuel that will follow tomorrow's debate.
But they hold out little hope of more than a token defection. The generosity
of the government's compensation package for pensioners hit by the tax has
seen to that.
Not even Mr William Powell, arguably the foremost Tory rebel over VAT on
fuel, plans to support the Labour amendment. The MP for Corby reasons that
tomorrow night's vote will not in fact be about VAT on fuel, but about
whether to give the finance bill a second reading.
What Labour leaders really hope will be achieved by tomorrow's debate - and
the argument that raged at the weekend over the respective tax burdens
imposed by Labour and Tory governments - is a further chipping away at the
image the Conservatives have traditionally enjoyed as the party of low taxes
and economic competence.
It is a slow and deliberate process. If in a couple of years during the next
election campaign the Tories are deterred from plastering Britain's
billboards with an updated version of the 'Labour's tax bombshell' posters
of 1992, it will be a sign that the Labour leader's strategy is working.
But so far the party is operating at only half-throttle. It can ruthlessly
attack the high taxes the Tories are levying in their efforts to bring the
public sector borrowing requirement under control. What it cannot do is
state categorically that taxes would be lower under Labour.
This is because the party has - quite deliberately - given not the faintest
inkling of the detailed economic policies on which it will fight the next
general election.
Its economic commission is just beginning the process of constructing a
watertight economic platform. Until the party unveils the fruits of its
labour, Mr Clarke can keep arguing that the Conservatives would tax less
than their principal opponents in any given year.

FT  24 JAN 94 / MPs to debate policy openness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs to debate policy openness MPs will this week consider a Tory
backbencher's bill which seeks to inject more openness into the process of
making monetary policy.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South West, is proposing that the
Treasury's periodic instructions to the Bank of England should be published.
His bill would also force a government that wished to change its chief
objective of monetary policy from price stability to draft a parliamentary
order.

The latest Sedgwick Noble Lowndes index of executive pay shows that pay for
senior managers has risen much faster in the past year than for most
employees and well beyond the 1.5 per cent ceiling demanded by the
government last year for public-sector workers. The rise in the retail
prices index is still below 2 per cent and the government is seeking to
freeze the public-sector pay bill.

FT  24 JAN 94 / ANC looks at how to pay for its programmes: The ambitious
economic goals of South Africa's probable new rulers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now for the hard part. As the African National Congress stands on the
threshold of the political kingdom in South Africa, ANC leaders at the
weekend launched a new and more difficult battle; the struggle for economic
power without which political rights are meaningless.
'No political democracy can survive and flourish if the mass of our people
remain in poverty, without land, without tangible prospects for a better
life,' says the foreword to the ANC's draft Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP), endorsed at a weekend conference of ANC allies. 'We must
not perpetuate the separation of our society into a 'first world' and a
'third world' - another disguised way of preserving apartheid.'
The crux of the problem is how to raise the mass of South Africa's people
out of third-world poverty. The draft programme dodges the hard choices, and
is probably better understood as an election manifesto than an economic
plan. It sets ambitious goals - over the next five years, 1m homes will be
built, 2.5m houses electrified, clean water, sanitation and health care
provided for all. But financing is at best vague, at worst unrealistic.
Nothing is costed, no priorities are set; all options (including the
perennial threat of nationalisation) are left open.
However, the programme provides the clearest indication yet of the policies
of the new government, which is likely to be dominated by the ANC. The
document conveys caution about the speed of implementation, as well as a
commitment to fiscal discipline and the need to maintain macroeconomic
balance, which white South Africans and foreign investors will find
reassuring.
'We must finance the RDP in ways that do not cause undue inflation or
balance of payments difficulties,' it says, adding that 'the vast bulk of
the RDP will be financed by existing resources organised, rationalised and
directed within RDP guidelines'. The current budget deficit of 6 per cent of
gross domestic product would not be exceeded and the overall tax burden, as
a percentage of GDP, would remain the same 'until strong growth is
achieved'. The commitment to a budget deficit not exceeding 6 per cent of
GDP is further enshrined in a letter of intent sent last December to the
International Monetary Fund and signed by the ANC.
Still, Mr Trevor Manuel, ANC economics head, makes clear the 6 per cent
ceiling will not apply beyond the 1994-95 budget - he says it would be
preposterous to assume RDP can be funded without borrowing more - and ANC
plans for 'increasing the efficiency of consumption expenditure and
improving the revenue recovery capacities of government' display a touching
faith in the powers of the new broom.
Mr Manuel points out that a budget of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn) for a
nation of 40m people is already not small; and World Bank figures show South
Africa already spends more than twice as much on education, as a percentage
of GDP (7.3 per cent in 1993), as any other nation in its income bracket,
and more even than high-income countries.
On health, only Hungary and the UK spent more proportionately than South
Africa; Sweden spent only a tenth as much.
Most of this money goes to fund the bloated bureaucracy, which can only
increase in the first years of an ANC government: nine new provincial
administrations will be set up under the constitution; the RDP proposes
creating a host of state or parastatal bodies - a national housing bank, an
implementation commission, all the apparatus of the centrally planned state
 -and affirmative action will swell the civil service further. It is hard to
accept the ANC's optimism about vanquishing corruption and inefficiency
overnight.
A few months in power will probably reveal to the ANC all the contradictions
inherent in its plan: it calls for 'people's power' to be exercised at all
levels, while simultaneously demanding a high degree of central planning;
and it proposes huge spending increases without concomitant rises in
revenue.
The document ponders a host of new taxes: 'reconstruction levies' in the
form of taxes on capital transfers, land and luxury goods; a new national
insurance charge; and privately, ANC leaders are still debating a specific
wealth tax as a levy on assets.
'When the crunch comes, which way will they jump? Will they slow
implementation, or raise taxes?' asks one businessman, who notes that ANC
leaders are at best reluctant converts to market economics. Most ANC leaders
still pursue a moral approach to economic questions, arguing 'it must be
done, it should be done, therefore it will be done', says another
businessman.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Australian investment in UK soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian investment in Britain has risen more than tenfold, to almost
ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7.4bn) since Australia lifted exchange controls a
decade ago.
This makes Britain the biggest single offshore home for Australian
investment. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, 'Australia
sends about 35 per cent of its offshore direct investment to Britain, which
is eight times more than could be expected from the size of the UK economy.'
Australia is also the fourth largest overseas investor in the UK.
The report finds Britain is the second largest investor in Australia,
although only 7 per cent of its offshore direct investment goes in this
direction.
The strength of investment ties is surprising, given the shift in Australian
trade flows towards Asia and Britain's, toward Europe.
The report points out that the wave of Australian investment in Britain over
the past decade is largely accounted for by just 16 companies - among them,

FT  24 JAN 94 / Minister quits over funds allegations

<TEXT>
Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, has lost his second senior
minister in as many months. Mr Alan Griffiths, minister for industry,
technology and regional development, resigned at the weekend amid
allegations that party funds and electoral office facilities had been
misused in a private business interest.
Mr Keating said in a statement that Mr Griffiths had informed him of
'serious concerns' about the possible misuse of funds, but added: 'He told
me that he had no involvement at all in any of these matters and that his
lawyers are satisfied that on the material presented to them. . . in their
opinion he is not guilty of any wrongdoing or impropriety.'
The departure of Mr Griffiths comes only a month after Mr Dawkins, the
treasurer, announced his intention to resign - and ultimately to leave
politics - for personal reasons. While Mr Dawkins was a more senior
politician and a member of Mr Keating's 'inner' circle, Mr Griffiths, aged
41, has been viewed as one of the Labor party's rising stars.

North Korea appears to be backing away from a promise made to the US
agreeing in principle to full international inspections of its seven
declared nuclear facilities.
Negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency
on these inspections have reached an impasse after Pyongyang said it would
bar full access to a 5MW reactor and a 'radiochemical laboratory', believed
to be a plutonium reprocessing facility, at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
North Korea said at the weekend it had agreed in re-cent talks with the US
to allow inspections that would guarantee 'the continuity of (nuclear)
safeguards'. But it was under no obligation to accept full IAEA inspections,
since it had only 'suspended temporarily' its March 1993 decision to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The IAEA wants to inspect the reactor's fuel rods and substances used in the
radiochemical laboratory to guarantee that the North has not diverted
plutonium for its suspected nuclear weapons programme.
But North Korea will only permit the replacement of film and batteries for
surveillance cameras at these sites. The IAEA has refused the offer, stating
that the North must submit to the full range of IAEA inspections initially
accepted in 1992.
North Korea claimed it agreed to new, limited IAEA inspections in return for
the promised suspension of this year's US-South Korean 'Team Spirit'
military exercise, which has not yet been announced.
Pyongyang appears to be toughening its stance on regular IAEA inspections of
its declared nuclear facilities, explaining that they will only be allowed
after the US holds another round of high-level talks with the North in an
attempt to improve relations.
The US has rejected that demand, saying it will discuss improved ties only
if the North permits regular IAEA inspections and renews talks with South
Korea on denuclearisation.
The US has indicated that if North Korean fails to reach an inspection
accord with the IAEA, it will ask the UN Security Council to impose
sanctions on Pyongyang. China and Japan are urging caution in transferring
the issue to the UN since it could increase tensions in the Korean
peninsula.

FT  24 JAN 94 / LDP aid sought for reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Members of Japan's ruling coalition today meet the opposition Liberal
Democratic party in an attempt to revive political reform plans, crippled by
a revolt in the alliance's own camp.
Proposals for the most radical reorganisation of Japan's scandal-tainted
democracy for more than 45 years were voted down at their final hurdle in
the upper house of parliament on Friday.
A defiant Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has staked his job on
reforming the political and electoral system, vowed over the weekend to
soldier on. Mr Hosokawa also said he would, as planned, meet Mr Bill
Clinton, the US president, for the US-Japan summit on February 11, to
conclude talks on opening Japan's market to imports.
The government would make 'serious and vigorous efforts' to launch economic
stimulus measures before the US summit, said Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance
minister. Fears that an urgently needed economic stimulus package will be
delayed beyond its expected arrival in the next few days are expected to
trigger a fall in Japanese share prices today.
Mr Hosokawa hopes to persuade the LDP to form a joint panel of the upper and
lower houses of parliament to agree to a watered-down version of his four
reform bills. This will be discussed today by directors of the lower
chamber's steering committee, from the government and LDP.
Such a panel would need a two-thirds majority for a new scheme, before it
could pass the amended plan to both houses for adoption by simple majority.
However, the chances of success are overshadowed by the fact that an unknown
number of LDP politicians oppose the reform plan's proposed abandonment of
Japan's unique multi-seat constituency system.
The surprise vote against the plans, at what had appeared to be the climax
of a five-year national debate, provoked a stream of support for political
reform in the weekend press.
The next stage is unclear. Several Japanese political observers yesterday
predicted that Mr Hosokawa might resign after the US summit and then hand
over the reins of the coalition to Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, or
to Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary.
However, this would be only an interim leadership, according to Mr Minoru
Morita, a popular political commentator, who believes the present drama is
an early step in a political realignment that will take many years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN
The Japanese press pinned the blame on the Social Democratic party for last
Friday's unexpected defeat of the political reform bill in the upper house.
Many papers carried front-page pictures of SDP defectors brandishing green
opposition ballots, while the Asahi Shimbun, the left-leaning daily, ran a
picture of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, party leader, bowing deeply in apology to
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who masterminded the political reform offensive.
The Asahi, however, also pointed a finger at the Liberal Democratic party,
the leading opposition group, claiming in its editorial that the
scandal-ridden LDP rule created the need for political reform, and it was
the LDP which failed to implement reform while in power.
The leading national dailies also managed a jibe at Mr Ozawa, for whom they
have had little love ever since he lashed out at two leading national papers
for unfavourable reports. The Mainichi Shimbun called the bill's defeat a
rejection by the upper house of 'Ozawa GHQ's steamroller tactics'.
With only a week to work out a compromise reform bill, pessimism prevailed
in the papers' predictions on the fate of reform.
The Yomiuri Shimbun, the conservative daily, urged against an agreement
where an anti-corruption bill is separated from electoral reform - a plan
suggested by LDP elders and some SDP members - calling it a 'deception' by
politicians trying to save their own necks.
Fears were also raised over the economy. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the
business daily, warned against 'anarchy on the economic front', also
predicting a delay in tax reform and confusion among economic planners and
the financial markets.
Most of the press were vague on the fate of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime
minister, who pledged to resign if political reform failed to pass through
parliament. The dailies carried comments by the LDP's Mr Michio Watanabe,
former foreign minister, that he would not pursue Mr Hosokawa's resignation.
Even the sports tabloids provided some political analysis. Tokyo Sports,
known for its lurid headlines, explained that the turmoil over political
reform was just another version of the popular sports games between rivals
Keio and Waseda (Japan's version of Oxford and Cambridge), dubbing it a
match between Mr Ozawa, a Keio graduate, and LDP leader Mr Yohei Kono, a
Waseda man.
UNITED STATES
Great disasters are a regular occurrence in southern California and the
region's main newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, is equipped to deal with
them.
After winning a Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the 1992 riots in Los
Angeles, the LA Times produced the same sort of blanket reporting after last
week's earthquake.
Even the paper's slimline east coast edition - a model of compactness and
clarity which some Californian readers beg the company to send them in place
of the advertisement-laden local edition - offered seven complete pages on
the 'Disaster before Dawn' and its aftermath.
Besides one editorial and opinions from outside contributors, the LA Times
contained articles by 18 bylined reporters, and gave credit for their
contributions to another 132 people on the editorial staff and 24 special
correspondents.
In its editorial, the LA Times remained strictly practical, concentrating on
the implications of the quake for the region's freeway and rail networks.
From the other side of the country, the New York Times editorialists were
unable to get so close to the ground; instead, they mused weightily on 'the
precariousness of human life on the edge of nature's immense, imponderable
forces'.
But for most people, the earthquake was a television event, with the first
reports coming on the Monday morning news shows. Even the venerable Mr
Walter Cronkite, fortuitously in Los Angeles on personal business, made a
brief report.
His successor as CBS's anchor, Mr Dan Rather, is usually so obsessed with
natural disasters - especially hurricanes - that he can be counted on to
turn up. This time, however, he did not broadcast from Los Angeles until
Tuesday, beaten to the draw by Mr Peter Jennings of ABC and Mr Tom Brokaw of
CBS.
BURMA
There is something quaint about The New Light of Myanmar, the official
newspaper of the Burmese military junta.
The absence of real domestic news or debate, the plethora of irrelevant
foreign stories taken from news agencies ('With 80 foreign news reports' the
paper boasted on Friday), and the bizarre, empty formulas used to describe
the activities of government ministers have the flavour of the press in a
Soviet satellite state during the 1970s.
Previously called The Working People's Daily, the NLM is required reading
for students of Burma, just as Pravda was scrutinised by Kremlin-watchers in
the heyday of Soviet communism.
Rangoon diplomats are always alert for clues to the thinking of Burma's
secretive rulers: Why was such and such a general not shown in the
photograph on page four? Why was this speech given more prominence than that
speech?
One big news item last week was the latest session of a national convention,
whose members are being coerced by the junta into drafting a new,
pro-military constitution.
But more prominence - the diplomats noted - was given to daily mass rallies
by the Union Solidarity and Development Association (Usda), a group founded
four months ago to support the junta and probably to become its future
political wing.
Reports of these rallies are reassuringly predictable. Columns of people
march to a sports ground; a leader addresses the rally and condemns the
'wily tricks of neo-colonialists'; the people unanimously approve six
motions (including one in support of the forthcoming constitution); the
'mammoth gathering' then closes with either 'thunderous applause', or, more
usually, 'tumultuous chanting of slogans'; people then depart in an orderly
manner.
The NLM blithely ignores the reluctance with which people attend these
rallies (most are civil servants and schoolchildren bussed to the site) and
the guerrilla methods used by Burmese citizens to express displeasure with
Usda functions (by cheering in the wrong places, and crowding at the exits
to get out before the end).
With Orwellian audacity, the NLM last week published an editorial in praise
of truth. 'As always,' it said, 'truth shall prevail, and when more of our
brethren realise who it is that drives a wedge between us (the editorial
does not say who is driving wedges) and how much we must together resist
such dastardly acts, we will come out the victor. In truth we trust.' Up to
a point, Lord Copper.

Victor Mallet in Rangoon.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Economics chief learns not to upset the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds more like (Finance Minister) Derek
Keys'. That is the South African business community's idea of a compliment,
its way of saying that African National Congress economics chief Trevor
Manuel increasingly tailors his economic rhetoric to the hard South African
realities stressed by Mr Keys.
Mr Manuel is a politician, not a technocrat (Mr Keys pretends to be the
opposite, though his political skills are not inconsiderable). But in the
two years since he was brought in as political head of the ANC economics
department, the 37-year-old Mr Manuel has rapidly scaled a steep learning
curve in economic theory.
Bombarded by economic home truths from business and international financial
institutions, Mr Manuel has avoided saying things which increase the blood
pressure of businessmen and investors and sink prices on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange.
In a weekend interview, he opposed the imposition of a wealth tax - an idea
which remains popular among many ANC leaders - preferring instead a
'reconstruction bond' which would attract voluntary capital from domestic
and overseas sources, as well as measures to compel life offices to commit a
percentage of assets to 'socially desirable investments'; he stressed the
need to proceed carefully with any tax increases, noting 'if every time you
need money you raise taxes, you can't govern'.
But the firmness of his commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline and
macroeconomic balance remains to be tested. In the days before the burden of
political office descends, Mr Manuel knows he can please the markets without
disappointing the electorate. All the hardest choices can be avoided until
forced on the ANC by the pressures of government.

Libya has sharply cut its budget forecast for 1994 because of difficulties
caused by UN sanctions, Reuter reports.
'The cut amounts to several billions (dollars),' Prime Minister Abouzid Omar
Dourdah said yesterday after the commission of the General People's Congress
adopted the draft budget. Figures for the new budget were not made
available.
'As a result of the unjust UN sanctions we have been forced to cut our
expenses in several domains such as education and health,' said Mr Dourdah.
The budget was set in such a way that Libya would rely less on oil, its main
source of revenue, he said.

Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has announced new measures designed to
prevent a build-up of liquidity in the country's financial system and to
combat further inflationary pressures. writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
From today residents will no longer be able to sell short- term monetary
instruments to non-residents, including treasury bills and government
securities. From the beginning of next month commercial banks will also have
to lodge with Bank Negara all funds in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, held
by foreign institutions in non-interest-bearing accounts.
Large amounts of funds have been attracted into Malaysia in recent months,
drawn by the country's strong economic performance and soaring stockmarket.
Bank Negara says it is determined to ensure that short-term speculative
funds do not destabilise the economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Intensive diplomatic activity yesterday injected momentum into the Middle
East peace process as Israel and the PLO expressed cautious optimism about
progress in stalled peace negotiations and Jerusalem renewed an offer for
unconditional talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
The signs of progress came on the eve of the resumption of suspended peace
talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours, due to begin in Washington
today.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel was 'pretty close' to
reaching agreement with the PLO after he met Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
in Oslo on Saturday. Mr Peres said Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala'a) of the PLO and
Mr Yoel Singer, an Israeli legal adviser, would meet in Paris during the
week to summarise points of agreement and exchange documents.
Mr Peres said there was a more than 50 per cent chance a final agreement
could be reached when he meets Mr Arafat again at the Davos Economic Forum
in Switzerland next Sunday.
In Cairo Mr Arafat said: 'There are some points we haven't agreed on but
there are some obstacles we managed to overcome.'
Neither Mr Peres nor Mr Arafat confirmed the details of the progress reached
in Oslo. Mr Arafat yesterday briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the Oslo
talks. Officials said Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, would visit
Jerusalem today to help consolidate any achievements.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, endorsed the view that progress
had been made in Oslo. 'I believe an Israeli clarification and its position
in principal matters of security has begun to bear results.' Mr Rabin also
said he was ready to meet President Assad without any prior conditions in
order to advance the peace process.
Following the meetings in Cairo, Mr Arafat was scheduled to fly to Saudi
Arabia for the first time since the kingdom severed ties with the PLO for
siding with Iraq in the Gulf war.

US government officials mobilised 'the biggest urban aid programme in US
history' over the weekend to help victims of the Los Angeles earthquake.
The National Guard erected tents and kitchens in parks and playing fields to
shelter up to 5,000 homeless people and those afraid to return to their
damaged dwellings. Red Cross shelters are housing a further 7,000 people and
feeding another 3,000.
Health authorities sent teams of doctors and nurses to makeshift camps over
the weekend as hospitals reported a growing number of exposure-related
illnesses.
With many doctors' offices and chemists closed, there is growing concern
about health care. Eighteen hospitals in the region have closed all or part
of their facilities because of damage and staff shortages.
Governor Pete Wilson said yesterday the quake had surpassed Hurricane
Andrew, a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.2bn) storm, as the costliest natural
disaster in US history. As the city was hit by three more sizeable
aftershocks, the death toll was reported to have risen to 56.
President Bill Clinton announced the release of Dollars 283m (Pounds 191m)
to help disaster relief efforts, bringing the total amount of federal aid to
Dollars 639m in funds for low-interest loans, Dollars 41m for emergency
highway repairs and Dollars 143m in emergency grant funds. This week, an
emergency appropriations bill is expected to be presented to Congress
seeking additional spending for earthquake repairs.
'Los Angeles will come back. Together with the people of Los Angeles, we'll
help to make that happen,' the president said in his weekly radio address on
Saturday.
By yesterday, over 25,000 people had applied for financial assistance at
government emergency aid centres or by telephone. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which last week came under sharp criticism for its
inadequate response, said that it would open six additional centres where
earthquake victims can apply for housing grants and low-interest loans.
Mr Richard Riley, education secretary, said his department 'is fully
committed to making sure that we do everything necessary to help restore the
Los Angeles schools'.
Damage from the earthquake is more widespread than initially thought,
officials said. South Central Los Angeles, the site of riots in 1992, has
sustained substantial damage. The worst hit areas are to the north, in the
San Fernando Valley, and to the west, in Santa Monica. The central business
district of Los Angeles emerged largely unscathed.
Seismic experts studying the uneven pattern of damage now believe shock
waves bounced off the mountains round the San Fernando Valley, exacerbating
the impact on some areas and reducing it in others.

FT  24 JAN 94 / US carmakers see off foreign competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the big three US carmakers, increased
their sales of cars and light trucks in the US by 10.5 per cent last year,
gaining market share at the expense of both Japanese and European vehicle
producers.
Helped by strong performances by Chrysler and Ford, the big three captured
73.9 per cent of the US light vehicle market, up from 72.2 per cent a year
earlier.
The total light vehicle market rose 8 per cent to 13.92m from 12.89m a year
earlier, the highest level since 1989. Sales of new cars rose 3.7 per cent
to 8.52m, but the strongest growth came from the light truck sector -
pick-ups, four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles
 -where sales climbed 15.5 per cent to 5.4m and accounted for 39 per cent of
the total light vehicle market.
The share of imported cars and light trucks fell to 16 per cent from 18.6
per cent.
Japanese vehicle makers have lost market share for the last two years,
falling to 23.1 per cent from 24.3 per cent in 1992 and 25.7 per cent in
1991.
Honda sales fell by 6.8 per cent but Nissan, the second largest Japanese
carmaker, succeeded in reversing several years of US decline by lifting
sales 17.2 per cent.
The fortunes of European carmakers in the US market have been in decline for
several years and their light vehicle market share fell again to only 2.3
per cent.
Several European carmakers have abandoned the US market in recent years,
most recently Peugeot and the Rover group's Sterling cars operation.
Of the survivors Alfa Romeo, part of the Fiat group of Italy, suffered a
53.1 per cent fall in sales to only 1,325.
The Volkswagen group, the only European volume carmaker remaining in the US
market, has also suffered a drastic fall with total light vehicle sales
dropping by 31.5 per cent to 62,064.
Sales by the VW brand fell 34.7 per cent to 49,536, while sales by its Audi
executive car division dropped 15.1 per cent to 12,528.
BMW of Germany has gained ground, however, with an aggressive pricing policy
and was the leading European importer in the US after boosting sales last
year by 18.8 per cent to 78,010.
Jaguar, the UK luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, has also halted its
decline, increasing US sales by 46.7 per cent to 12,734.
Forced by rising losses to abandon the US car market a couple of years ago,
the Rover group has been enjoying increasing success with its Land Rover
utility vehicles, which increased sales last year by 15.9 per cent to 4,907.
The company is aiming to quadruple US sales in the next couple of years with
the launch later this year of the Discovery range.
Although Japanese vehicle makers lost market share last year, they continue
to increase North American production.
The output of cars and light trucks in North America in Japanese plants and
at Japanese/US joint ventures managed by Japanese producers rose last year
by 6.6 per cent 2.15m.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Ankara warned on trade taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey has made big strides in liberalising its trade regime over the past
decade, but the economic benefits have been marred by rapid inflation,
swollen budget deficits and insufficient competition in the domestic market,
according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In a report on the country's trade policies and practices, the Gatt
secretariat says rampant inflation - currently exceeding 70 per cent a year
 -has been hard to restrain because the authorities have printed money to
finance large public deficits.
The government is also over-reliant on trade taxes, Gatt says, noting that
their share in the total tax revenue has risen from 12 per cent in 1980 to
18 per cent in 1990. As trade taxes become a diminishing source of revenue,
Ankara will have to find other ways to reduce the budget deficit and service
its foreign debt.
Turkey hopes to reach customs union with the European Union in 1995, which
will mean duty-free entry for EU goods and adoption of the EU's common
external tariff.
Gatt also notes that real wage increases, unmatched by productivity gains,
have eroded Turkey's competitiveness, leading to big trade deficits.
The report, the latest in a series on Gatt members' trade regimes, came at
the end of a week which saw a plunge in the value of the Turkish lira
following a downgrading of the country's credit rating by two US ratings
companies.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Bosnians renew air-strike plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fighting increased throughout Bosnia at the weekend following the failure of
talks last week on the former Yugoslav republic's partition.
Bosnian Moslems appealed for Nato air strikes against Serb gunners besieging
Sarajevo, the capital.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, said a mortar attack on
Saturday, in which six children died, was another Serb snub to a passive
world. In a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Mr
Silajdzic said: 'This act humiliates the international community, mocks the
dignity of the United Nations and renders senseless all of our efforts to
reach peace through negotiations.'
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, indicated yesterday during a
visit to Paris that there was uncertainty about the Nato strategy, despite
the alliance renewing its pledge at a summit two weeks ago to use air
strikes to prevent strangulation of Sarajevo and UN 'safe areas'.
Mr Christopher said he was confused about the French position towards Bosnia
and had to confer anew with Britain and Germany, but reaffirmed the US
commitment to Nato's position.
Lieut-Gen Francis Briquemont, outgoing commander of the UN Protection Force
in Bosnia, said UN forces were suffering a crisis of confidence as
politicians denied them the means to do their job.
In Bosnia, three children were reported killed yesterday in a Moslem attack
on the Croat-held part of Mostar while four civilians were killed in the
Croat enclave of Zepce.
Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur: Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian
prime minister, has launched a stinging attack on western countries for
their failure to act decisively in Bosnia. During a visit to Malaysia by
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Dr Mahathir said the west's policies
amounted to hypocrisy at its worst.

German unemployment will increase this year but the trend will reverse in
1995, when restructuring measures adopted by companies would be advanced or
finished, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, was quoted as saying
yesterday, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
According to the text of an interview to be broadcast on German television,
Mr Rexrodt said: 'The year 1994 will be a hard year with higher
unemployment. . . I assume this trend can be expected to change in 1995.'
The east German job market, which had already stabilised, would see more of
an upturn, Mr Rexrodt said.
West German unemployment rose to 2.49m in December, or 8.1 per cent. In east
Germany, the jobless total rose to 1.18m (15.4 per cent).

The Belgian government yesterday replaced Mr Guy Coeme as deputy prime
minister, after his resignation last week in the wake of a corruption
scandal over a deal to buy army helicopters, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The francophone Socialist party (PS) picked Mr Elio di Rupo, 43, formerly a
regional minister, to succeed Mr Coeme.
Mr Coeme and two regional PS politicians resigned on Friday over allegations
that the Italian company Agusta paid bribes to secure a contract in 1988.
All three have denied wrongdoing.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Fyodorov adrift in sea of promises: The leading reformer
fears the worst for Russia's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov's decision to resign as Russian finance minister
underlines what is widely seen as the chief obstacle to successful market
reform: rulers who cannot resist making promises they cannot keep.
'I can control the spending but not the promises,' Mr Fyodorov told the
Financial Times. 'Other people in the government think that just because
they are sitting in the White House (government headquarters), they have the
god-given right to spend money. . . They don't understand you cannot do it.'
Mr Fyodorov, a leading reformer, fears that spending in Russia is about to
run out of control, fuelling inflation and undermining any hope of
stabilising the Russian economy.
The first sign, since his announced departure, that the new cabinet is ready
to loosen the government purse strings came at the weekend: the first
spending decisions included a big increase in subsidies to the farm sector
announced by Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister for agriculture,
and a doubling in the amount of money the central bank will be asked to
print to support expenditure which cannot be covered by budget revenues.
Stung by the international outcry over Mr Fyodorov's resignation, a
spokesman for Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin said his new course
'contains elements of western market economics but takes into account the
special characteristics of our state, people and Russian traditions'.
It is possible Mr Chernomyrdin wants to restrict spending. But his recent
endorsement of a plan to spend up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) on a new
parliament building provides a telling example of how Russia's rulers, in Mr
Fyodorov's words, look 'at a problem and decide to throw money at it
regardless of whether this money exists'.
For all his tough words, Mr Chernomyrdin has appeared unable to resist the
pressure to make promises he cannot keep. The state owes about Rbs1,000bn to
the defence industry for weapons it ordered under pressure from the military
in the past year. Under pressure from agricultural lobbyists, it set
procurement prices for grain twice as high as those on an emerging free
market, but then failed to pay the money. It liberalised coal prices but
promised to continue paying subsidies to coal miners, without putting any
pressure on the industry to restructure or consider closing unprofitable
mines.
Such promises have left Mr Fyodorov in the uncomfortable role of having to
break them by telling people there are no funds - save by printing money and
fuelling inflation. And he adds that Russia's main problem is not so much a
lack of money but a waste of it.
'You find that in 90 per cent of cases, money is misspent or people did not
need it,' he said. Corruption and inefficient institutions meant that
subsidies rarely reached their targets, while those most in need of support
felt abandoned by the government. 'If you stand in front of the British
Treasury for an hour and shout, nobody will give you any money,' Mr Fyodorov
said. 'But here it works, so why should people stop doing it?'
Supporters of Russian reforms believe the west must and can help Moscow
cover budget expenditure which cannot be cut overnight. But they also argue
that this can happen only if spending is not in the hands of people like Mr
Zaveriukha.
If Mr Fyodorov leaves the government, he plans to focus on his role as a
deputy in parliament, to take his fight to voters ahead of new elections
scheduled for 1996.
'We have to talk to people more and conduct more propaganda to tell them how
things work. Then we will have a second chance in the elections.'
But pessimists believe a second chance may not materialise if, by that time,
Mr Chernomyrdin's muddling through goes so badly wrong that the people will
be ready for medicine more drastic than even Mr Fyodorov proposes.

FT  24 JAN 94 / New party aims to save the D-Mark: Bonn already sees Bund
freier Burger as right-wing threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WIESBADEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With plentiful supplies of coffee and cakes, and a fair amount of procedural
confusion, 120 worthy German citizens gathered in an unremarkable hotel in
Wiesbaden, the eminently respectable capital of the state of Hesse,
yesterday to found the latest challenge to the German political
establishment.
The Bund freier Burger (BFB), or Free Citizens' Alliance, plans to campaign
in the forthcoming European elections in June, and in the general election
for the German Bundestag in October, for freedom, the market economy, and
the preservation of the Deutsche Mark.
If it were not for that final ambition, the exercise might be dismissed as a
hopeless tilt at the creaking windmills of German democracy. But the desire
to save the D-Mark from being swallowed up in a nebulous European Ecu,
created by the Maastricht process of European economic and monetary union,
is one shared by about 75 per cent of the German population. It could prove
to be a real vote-winner at a time of widespread disaffection with all the
main parties of the political establishment.
At the same time there is more than a sneaking suspicion that the new party
is trying to steal a few leaves from the book of Mr Jorg Haider, the
right-wing leader of Austria's Freedom party, who has gained widespread
support and notoriety by appealing to latent xenophobia.
The BFB is the brainchild of Mr Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to
Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in Brussels and
principal challenger of the Maastricht treaty when it came before the German
constitutional court last year.
Mr Brunner looks more like a bank manager than a Don Quixote, with a round,
earnest face and spectacles. Yet he has lost his job and risked his career
in his determination to fight the treaty, and the overwhelmingly
pro-European Union establishment. He says Mr Haider is 'a sensible man with
interesting ideas'.
He is clearly regarded as a threat in some quarters. The founding meeting of
the party had to be moved at the last minute from the far more evocative
surroundings of Weimar, the home town of Goethe, in east German Thuringia,
because of a bomb threat to the Hilton Hotel.
Mr Franz Schuster, the Christian Democrat interior minister in the state,
declared the proposed party to be more dangerous than either the far
right-wing Republicans, or the even more extreme National Democratic party
(NPD).
Yesterday's meeting could scarcely have been called threatening. The
participants, mostly male and with an average age of 50, were almost
entirely solid representatives of the bourgeoisie, small businessmen, the
self-employed, professionals and professors.
They are all frustrated with the political process, and their former
political parties.
'All the parties have become the same,' Mr Ralf Gutmann, president of the
national dentists' association, declared. 'It is not bad to be conservative.
It is about preserving something.'
'The word bourgeois is not a swear word any more,' said Professor
Bernd-Thomas Ramb, who describes himself as an entrepreneur. 'It means a
consciousness of freedom with responsibility.'
Mr Brunner is clear that his main platform is anti-European. He does not
want to dismantle the European Union, but he wants to make sure it is no
more than a loose confederation of nation states. He does not want to lose
the D-Mark, and he wants to make sure Germany's money pays first of all for
German unification, before it is redistributed round the rest of the EU.
His problem is that he is plunging into an increasingly crowded market
place. Another 'citizens' movement', the Hamburg-based Statt Partei -
'Instead of a party' - decided on Saturday to organise itself on a national
basis. It is also clearly pitched at the disaffected bourgeoisie.
As for the far right, if that is where Mr Brunner ends up, he will have to
contend with the well-organised Republicans, as well as the Deutsche
Volksunion (DVU) and the NPD. They could all be forced to split the
conservative, nationalist vote, and thus all fail to gain the necessary 5
per cent support for a seat in any parliament.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Recovery eludes German chemicals
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German chemicals manufacturers' profits fell sharply for the fourth
successive year in 1993, and there is no sign of a lasting recovery,
according to Mr Gert Becker, president of the VCI industry association.
The world marketplace had undergone a fundamental change, and it was no
longer possible to make certain products competitively in Germany, he said
in a new year review.
Aggregate earnings tumbled 30 per cent in 1993, following a similar slump
the previous year and falls of 20 and 25 per cent in 1991 and 1990
respectively.
Prices in Germany for raw materials, labour, energy, environmental
protection, taxes and social welfare were far higher than in many other
countries. But industry's influence over these cost factors was severely
limited, said Mr Becker, who is also chairman of Degussa.
The indigenous industry could succeed only if it was able to bring
innovations to market. That depended on government willingness to reduce
bureaucracy and legal hindrances to investment, and popular acceptance of
the need for scientific and technical progress.
Government health reforms led to a 4 per cent drop in drugs production last
year, Mr Becker claimed, compared with an overall 3 per cent decline in the
industry's volume output.
Deliveries of chemical fibres fell 12 per cent; producer prices were down
2.6 per cent; and industry-wide turnover from these products slipped 5.5 per
cent to DM155bn (Pounds 60.5bn).
Production of basic inorganic chemicals fell 5 per cent while organic
chemicals prices were 6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The industry shed almost 5 per cent of its workforce, cutting 29,000 jobs,
said Mr Becker, adding that labour cuts would continue this year. Investment
dropped to DM9.5bn from DM11.3bn in 1992, while spending on research and
development was maintained at DM10.6bn.

FT  24 JAN 94 / France goes on the defence offensive: The quiet revolution
which sees Paris breaking away from its go-it-alone tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France is rapidly adopting a more international approach to defence, in a
revolution quieter in tone than the changes wrought to its commercial policy
by the Gatt world trade negotiations but more far-reaching in substance.
Indeed, French officials now fear that their European allies are taking too
parochial a view of the continent's security needs, in Bosnia and elsewhere.
This is a far cry from the go-it-alone tendency that has characterised
French defence policy for a generation since President de Gaulle pulled
France out of Nato's integrated military command in 1966.
The catalyst for the new policy was this month's Nato summit, which
crystallised the post-cold war shift of responsibility for European defence
from the US towards Europe. The new policy will be enshrined in a French
defence white paper due to be published next month, as the doctrinal basis
for the country's 1995-2000 defence programme to be presented to parliament
later this year.
'The best Nato summit ever, from France's viewpoint,' was how a senior
Elysee official summed up the Brussels meeting.
The summit endorsed the Maastricht treaty's concept of a European defence
identity. It agreed that Nato assets could be used by the Western European
Union defence organisation in purely European operations and proposed the
setting up of 'combined joint task forces'. This piece of military
gobbledygook is designed as political cover for bringing into Nato planning
a France that refuses formally to re-enter the alliance's regular integrated
command.
'We cannot put the 1966 decision in question,' Mr Francois Leotard, France's
defence minister, said wryly.
'It is now part of our military/cultural heritage.'
But France's satisfaction at Nato's green light for European defence is
tempered by its gnawing worry at the sharp decline of interest among many
European countries on matters military. Mr Leotard asked recently whether
'the concept of defence which is taking root in northern Europe' -
neutrality in Scandinavia, and lack of interest in countries like Germany
and the Netherlands - 'does not threaten to lead the whole of Europe into
inaction, then to disappearance'.
The decline can be measured in defence budgets. A senior French official
notes, with as much anxiety about German and British defence cuts as pride
in France's sustained spending, that 'of the 1994 military equipment budgets
of the nine WEU countries, France accounts for 42 per cent of the total.'
Despite all their past investment on defence, a majority of the French
people still do not seem anxious to cash in their peace dividend on the
ending of the cold war. Indeed, the forthcoming white paper will tell them
that their security is still at risk - though from different dangers which
require closer co-operation with fellow Europeans.
A current draft of the white paper, the first for 20 years, argues that
'defence of France's vital interests can be envisaged with Britain and
Germany', that this co-operation can include discussions on nuclear weapons,
and that France's military action will be increasingly directed at
prevention of direct/indirect threats to its wider strategic interests,
short of full-scale war.
As a result, Mr Leotard argues that the French themselves must learn to
think 'geo-strategically', as Americans have long done, and that 'having
been a net importer (from the US) of security during the cold war, Europe
must now have the capacity to export security.'
This, says the white paper draft, involves remedying France's weaknesses in
intelligence gathering, force projection and logistic back-up. 'These
weaknesses were acceptable, even deliberate in an earlier period. . . but
they are glaring and hardly tolerable when the international situation and
our political commitments require long-range intervention by our forces.' In
all arms programmes, as well as force deployments, France must co-operate
more with its European partners, the paper says, while not letting its
overall military spending fall below 3.1 per cent of national output.
Much of the white paper just elevates to the level of principle what France
has recently been doing in practice - setting up the Eurocorps and moving
towards Nato inside Europe, and contributing in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia
more troops to UN peacekeeping than any other country.
But will France's famous national consensus on defence hold if this defence
is defined in more international terms?
Defence policy has been popular in France precisely because it has been
relatively self-centred and because allies have been regarded in the last
(nuclear) resort as unreliable. Will French soldiers really be any readier
than others to fight for ill-defined causes in Europe's name?
Similarly, high French budgets have been accepted precisely because, in the
words of a top French officer, 'more than 90 per cent is spent at home - a
form of industrial policy'. Are French taxpayers ready to see more of their
money spent on German or British weapons? These are the contradictions that
France's new co-operative stance on defence will bring.

FT  24 JAN 94 / West's resolve dissolves into uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton of the US was right to warn his Nato partners at
their recent summit in Brussels not to make threats about military action in
Bosnia which were never likely to be carried out. The events of the last few
days have underlined precisely what he was talking about.
In spite of UN Security Council and Nato resolutions on the use of air
strikes - Nato leaders made a solemn declaration on the subject less than
two weeks ago - there are no indications that these are imminent. Indeed, at
least one of the countries with peacekeeping troops on the ground in Bosnia
 -Canada - has already made clear its opposition to such strikes. The
determination of others is also in doubt.
Yet the Nato declaration on the subject was couched in the clearest possible
terms. 'We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the United Nations
Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions on August 2
and 9 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangulation
of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in
Bosnia-Hercegovina,' it said.
After last Saturday's attack by Bosnian Serb gunners on a district of
Sarajevo only a few hundred metres from UN peacekeeping force headquarters,
in which six children were killed, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian
government's Moslem prime minister, appears fully justified in making his
latest appeal for Nato air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. Sarajevo,
after all, has been designated by the UN as a 'safe area,' a status which
has never been respected by the Bosnian Serbs.
After his unseemly squabbles with General Jean Cot, whom he obliged to
retire as French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
UN secretary-general, has at last confirmed he is ready to order air strikes
in Bosnia if asked to do so by his special envoy in Yugoslavia, Mr Yasushi
Akashi. But it seems doubtful, to say the least, whether he is prepared to
authorise such bombardments other than to allow Canadian peacekeeping troops
in the eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica to be relieved.
To confuse the situation even further, the main countries with peacekeeping
troops on the ground in Bosnia - France, Britain, Spain and Canada - have
adopted self-contradictory positions on the subject. On the one hand they
have put their names to the Nato declaration; on the other they have always
opposed military action which could put the lives of their own troops in
danger.
That situation would be clarified if, as Britain and France have intimated,
they withdraw their troops at the end of spring. But what, only a few days
ago, appeared to be almost a foregone conclusion, has once again become
questionable.
Both countries have made it clear that the decision to go or stay would not
be taken unilaterally but was one for all the nations participating in the
UN Protection Force (Unprofor) to take.
Furthermore, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, seems to be in
greater doubt about the wisdom of withdrawal after his visit to British
troops in central Bosnia at the end of last week than he was before.
The foreign secretary said that the UN aid effort in a region contested by
Bosnian Moslems and Croats was working better than was generally realised. A
record six aid convoys had got through two days earlier.
He added that British troops believed they should stay, not only because aid
convoys were getting through, but because there was a strong feeling in the
region that if Unprofor troops were to leave 'the savagery of the war would
be substantially worse'.
Hardly surprising, therefore, that a decision on whether to withdraw British
troops is not imminent.
With the UN, Nato and their main member nations in a state of suspended
animation, and the Geneva peace talks as deadlocked as they ever were, the
prospects for any further international action in Bosnia remain decidedly
dim.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Deadline set for aluminium accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has set a January 28 deadline for the world's leading
aluminium producing nations to reach agreement on a memorandum to reduce
oversupply, a spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The decision follows four days of talks among trade representatives from
Russia, Australia, Canada, the 12-nation EU as one body, Norway and the US.
The industry had noted at a conference last December oversupply of 1.5m-2m
tonnes, an EU statement said. The memorandum would put in place 'an
adjustment process by way of market forces that would reduce the imbalance'.
A sharp increase in exports to the west by Russia following a collapse in
its domestic demand is widely blamed for the current surplus, pushing prices
to record lows.
The talks in Brussels have focused on how cuts of up to 2m tonnes a year of
annual output could be shared among Russia and the world's other key
producers. The US is expected to make anti-dumping charges against the
Russian industry if no agreement is reached.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Tories' tax record challenged: Treasury discloses tax burden
will be heavier than under Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party's credentials as the party of low taxation were under
fierce attack at Westminster last night after the publication of damaging
figures showing that the government will from April take more in tax from
the average family than Labour did.
The opposition parties pounced gleefully on the disclosure, with Labour
accusing the government of making the 'biggest tax demand in history'.
Labour hopes to make it impossible for the government to label it as the
high-tax party, a tactic the Conservatives used to great effect in the last
election.
Ominously for the government, some Tory backbench MPs were comparing the
political impact of the tax rises with the poll tax, which attracted
terminal unpopularity after it was implemented.
Tory MPs are now braced for pressure from their constituents over the
heavier tax burden once people realise how much extra tax they are paying.
People will find out either by being informed by the Inland Revenue or
simply by higher deductions taken from their pay in April.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke hit back at Labour, arguing that taxes would
always be lower under a Conservative government than under Labour in any
given year.
At the centre of the row, which arose just ahead of tomorrow's crucial House
of Commons debate on the finance bill, was the Treasury's disclosure that a
married man on average earnings with two children would this year pay 32.9
per cent of his earnings in direct and indirect taxes, rising to 35 per cent
in 1994-95. That compared with 32.2 per cent under Labour in 1978-1979.
Labour backed up its attack by highlighting official figures showing that
the proportion of gross domestic product taken by tax, excluding oil taxes,
would rise to 35 1/2 per cent in 1994-95 and 38 1/2 per cent in 1998-99.
That would outstrip the high of 36 3/4 per cent taken under the last Labour
government in 1975-76.
Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Clarke insisted that
comparing current levels of taxation with the last year of a Labour
government was 'false'. He said: 'If you had a Labour chancellor now, taxes
would be much, much higher.
'At the very end of the Labour government, they did actually get tax down
below where we are at the moment, but that was one of the most irresponsible
things that Denis Healey (then chancellor) did in the run-up to the
election.'
But Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, accused his opposite number of 'tax
deception'.
'The facts are incontrovertible,' Mr Brown said. 'Tax is higher than under
Labour. Because the Tories will never tell the truth about their tax bills,
the country will never trust them on tax again.' Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal
Democrat Treasury spokesman, joined the attack, saying that forthcoming tax
increases were 'so large they have put the recovery at risk'.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the influential Tory backbench finance
committee, said it was vital for the government to re-establish itself as a
tax-cutting administration.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Smarter meter puts gas users in control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time is running out for two long-standing features of British domestic life,
the traditional gas meter and the meter reader.
British Gas aims eventually to replace both with a brick-size electronic
'smart meter'.
In Edmonton, north London, 1,000 homes have been fitted with a Pounds 10
device which reads the existing gas meter automatically four times a day and
transmits the reading to local collection points.
Bigger changes should come from a joint venture British Gas has formed with
Gill Electronic, a Hampshire company, to mass produce a new generation of
meters which measure consumption electronically and transmit readings to a
central computer.
The spread of smart meters will help pave the way for a fully competitive
domestic gas market in 1998, the deadline set by the recent monopoly inquiry
into the gas market.
Consumers will then be able to choose their gas supplier; even selecting
different ones for different times of day.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Yeltsin faces last-ditch plea on reform: Fyodorov
resignation rejected as western aid is threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the outgoing Russian finance minister, is expected today
to make a last-ditch plea to President Boris Yeltsin not to abandon the
course of reform he launched two years ago.
The meeting with the president was suggested by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
prime minister, after he unexpectedly rejected Mr Fyodorov's resignation.
Ahead of the talks, Mr Fyodorov had not, however, changed his intention to
quit unless at least some of his conditions for staying were met.
International alarm over the government's intention to use 'non-monetary
methods' to fight inflation was confirmed at the weekend by the new
government's first spending decisions.
Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister for agriculture who is close
to the pro-Communist Agrarian party, announced that the new cabinet planned
to spend up to Rbs14 trillion on agricultural subsidies in 1994. 'This is
fully within the scope of our state budget,' said Mr Zaveriukha, omitting to
mention that Russia as yet does not have a budget for 1994.
Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, said the Rbs14 trillion,
which compares with a Rbs15 trillion budget deficit for the whole of 1993,
represented an increase from 7 per cent to 10 per cent in spending on
agricultural subsidies. They have proved ineffective so far.
Mr Alexashenko also disclosed in an interview that the government had
decided on Saturday to double the amount of money it would ask the central
bank to print in the first quarter of 1994. The government had initially
arranged to ask for Rbs7 trillion, but on Saturday settled for Rbs15
trillion. Mr Alexashenko said increased reliance on such inflationary forms
of financing would push inflation up to between 35 and 37 per cent a month
in June-July from a present monthly level of about 20 per cent.
A US Treasury official accompanying Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, on
a visit to Japan was quoted as saying in Tokyo last night that the
International Monetary Fund seemed unlikely to release a Dollars 1.5bn loan
to Russia because the reforms 'have gone off track'.
Mr Fyodorov announced he was quitting after Mr Chernomyrdin rejected his
demands for the removal of both Mr Zaveriukha and of Mr Victor Gerashchenko,
the central bank chairman, who believes that tough monetary and fiscal
policy are not what Russia needs.
Mr Chernomyrdin, angered by Mr Fyodorov's announcement of conditions under
which he would stay in government, said only on Friday that his departure
was 'not a tragedy'.
But on Saturday, possibly surprised by the international outcry over Mr
Fyodorov's departure, Mr Chernomyrdin told the finance minister he would not
accept the resignation and could not understand why he wanted to leave. Mr
Fyodorov is said to have replied he could not understand why Mr Zaveriukha
had been appointed deputy prime minister and not he.
In another sign that he underestimated Mr Fyodorov's importance to
international confidence, Mr Chernomyrdin is said to have telephoned
Russia's representative at the IMF about the postponement of its next
mission to Moscow, which he had counted on to unblock a Dollars 1.5bn loan.
Prof Yevgeny Yasin, a senior adviser to Mr Chernomyrdin, said he had told
the prime minister that he needed 'Fyodorov much more than he needed
Zaveriukha . . . only a tough man like Fyodorov can resist the wave of
pressure for more spending'.

FT  24 JAN 94 / VW chief may sue over 'concealed' losses at Seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has threatened possible legal
action against former managers of Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, for
allegedly concealing immense losses that drove the whole group into a
DM2.3bn (Pounds 890m) deficit last year.
A meeting on June 23 of Seat's supervisory board, which includes VW
executives, was told the subsidiary would make a DM150m loss, Mr Piech said
in an interview with El Pas, the Spanish daily newspaper, yesterday.
Since then, group auditors had discovered that Seat's management had been
presented one day earlier with a report from Mr Eberhardt Muller, then
finance director, warning that the company was technically bankrupt because
its 1993 losses would exceed its capital of Pta80bn, about DM1bn.
Mr Piech indirectly accused Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, former Seat
chairman, of concealing the truth: 'Personally, and this has to be proven, I
believe at least three people on the management board of Seat must have
known about the report.'
Mr Daz was dismissed last September. Since then, VW has confirmed Seat lost
DM1.4bn in 1993. Restructuring costs, including closure of a Barcelona
factory, are estimated at a further DM800m.
From a German point of view, the DM150m loss estimate issued on June 23 was
deliberate misinformation. For Mr Piech, that was 'an action that could have
penal consequences'.
VW said independent auditors had been appointed to investigate, and that
decisions on possible consequences, including legal action, would have to
wait until they had reported.
Mr Piech, whose career so far as VW chairman has been blighted by the
criminal investigation of his new production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, and the Seat crisis, also forecast further losses in the first
quarter of the current year.
But he told a German newspaper the deficit would be a fraction of the
DM1.25m loss booked in the same period of 1993, and that the group would
return to profit by the year's end. Seat was the only subsidiary expected to
remain in loss, with a deficit of DM200m, he said.
The group's forecasts of a return to health are based partly on the planned
introduction of shorter working time at its six German factories. VW has
claimed the so-called 'four-day week' scheme would save it DM1.8bn a year in
labour costs. However, details of the controversial plan are yet to be
agreed with social security officials and trade unions.

FT  24 JAN 94 / Executive pay rises three times faster than inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's executives won average pay and fringe benefit increases worth 5.7
per cent last year, compared with an average increase of 3 per cent for the
workforce as a whole.
The executives' pre-tax pay boost is nearly four times the increase gained
by public sector workers in 1993 under the government's 1.5 per cent pay
policy.
The scale of executive pay rises, disclosed in a survey of more than 400
companies, could spark political controversy. It comes as ministers are
trying to impose a three year freeze on the public sector's pay bill, and as
retail price increases run at less than 2 per cent annually.
Despite calls by ministers and employer bodies for executives to set an
example by tightening their belts, executives do not appear to have taken
much notice, suggests the survey carried out for the Financial Times.
The pay increases are disclosed in the latest quarterly executive pay index
produced by the Sedgwick Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and
actuaries. The index covers 5,200 executives in 411 companies.
Total annual earnings of all managers up to chief executive level rose by
38.6 per cent over the past four years. Average annual executive income is
now Pounds 85,188 compared with Pounds 80,577 a year ago, the survey shows.
The average annual basic executive salary stands at Pounds 60,840 compared
with Pounds 57,488 at the end of 1992.
Executive benefits on top of basic salaries averaged Pounds 14,348 last
year, or 27 per cent of their total remuneration.
Performance related bonus payments, often linked to profits, rose by 16.7
per cent to an average value in December of Pounds 9,865.
The largest pay rises last year, of 6.1 per cent, went to directors below
the chief executive level in large companies with annual turnovers of over
Pounds 600m. Their average total remuneration rose to Pounds 164,129 a year
from Pounds 154,624, with their basic salary increasing to Pounds 117,461
from Pounds 111,450.

telephone number for reservations is 071-930-0700.
To use your FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card select a participating restaurant
from the list published in the FT.
Present your card at the end of the meal as you would any other major credit
card, sign the Transmedia slip for the full amount and keep your copy.
Transmedia, not the restaurant, gives the 25 per cent saving and therefore
the 25 per cent saving that will not be deducted at the restaurant but will
appear on your Visa, Mastercard or Delta statement.
Transmedia will charge your Visa, Mastercard or Delta account for the full
amount of the Transmedia charge slip and will process a corresponding
transaction crediting your account for the 25 per cent discount on the food
and beverage portion of the slip.
Continue to check the published list of restaurants as some restaurants may
be added or deleted. Restaurant directories will be sent to cardholders
updating participating restaurants after the initial promotion has ended.
Only the application form printed in the FT is valid. Photocopies or any
other reproductions will not be accepted. Closing date for receipt of
applications for the launch promotion has been extended until Friday,
January 28 1994.
Applications should be sent to FT/Transmedia Restaurant offer, PO Box 85,
Watford, WD2 4WQ.
Cards are expected to be sent within seven days of application receipt.
Transmedia will continue to accept card applications after the initial
closing date, but cannot guarantee delivery in time for the launch
promotion.
Following the end of the FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion, a
computer-generated random selection will be made of 1000 Transmedia
restaurant charge slips generated over the promotion period of Monday
January 24 to Friday February 11 1994. Charge slips selected entitle each
winner to receive a Pounds 50 Transmedia credit toward their next visit to
any Transmedia restaurant while continuing to enjoy a 25 per cent discount
with their Transmedia card. The selection will take place on Tuesday, March
1 1994. Winners will be notified as soon as possible after Monday March 7.
The Financial Times and Transmedia cannot be responsible for lost or stolen
cards, although Transmedia will make every effort to recover these cards.
Transmedia will provide restaurants with an updated list of invalid cards.
The card holder should inform Transmedia as soon as possible to expedite
this procedure.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed rate mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lenders have been issuing new fixed rate mortgages. Abbey National's range
includes 7.15 per cent (7.5 APR) fixed until the end of April 1999, 6.75 per
cent (7.1 APR) fixed until April 30 1997 and a fixed rate of 6.39 per cent
(6.7 APR) until April 30 1996.
The booking fee is Pounds 300 for the five year fix and Pounds 250 for the
others. There are early redemption penalties of between 60-150 days loss of
interest. First-time borrowers are being offered 6.25 per cent (6.5 APR)
until the end of April 1996 and 6.59 per cent (6.8 APR) to April 30 1997.
The booking fee for both mortgages is Pounds 90 and early redemption
penalties are 60-90 days loss of interest. The mortgages are not linked to
compulsory insurance-related products.
Nationwide building society has released a new two-year fix of 5.85 per cent
(7.7 APR) for first time buyers for a Pounds 95 fee. The rate for other
borrowers is 5.99 (7.8 APR) and the fee is Pounds 200. Borrowers will get a
free valuation and Pounds 250 'cashback'. The early redemption penalty is 3
months. There is no compulsion to take out insurance-related products.
TSB is offering a 10-year fix at 7.89 per cent (8.4 APR) for an arrangement
fee of Pounds 250 but borrowers have to take out the bank's buildings and
home contents insurance. All the mortgages are portable.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Scottish Provident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Provident has cut payouts on short-term with-profits endowment
policies, but lifted longer-term payouts slightly. A 25-year policy, taken
out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, will pay Pounds 56,760 this
year, up 0.6 per cent from last year, while a 10-year policy would pay
Pounds 6,478, down 5.3 per cent.
The company has also changed its annual bonus system, with different bonus
levels on the sum assured and previous bonuses, rather than a single level
as before.
So rather than 5.2 per cent overall on life contracts paid last year, this
year the figures are 4 per cent on the sum assured and 6 per cent on
existing bonuses. This rewards longer term policy-holders more, as they have
accumulated more bonuses.
Terminal bonus scales have been adjusted to pay more to longer-term
policies. Bonus rates on unitised with-profits policies have also been cut,
from 8.5 per cent to 7.75 per cent for life, and 10 per cent to 9 per cent
for pensions.
Royal Life has increased payouts on with-profits endowments by increasing
terminal bonuses. The pay out on a 25-year policy is Pounds 61,172, up 10.1
per cent, and for a 10-year policy, Pounds 5,878, up 0.1 per cent.
Reversionary bonuses on unitised with profits policies have been held at 6.5
per cent, but terminal bonuses have been raised from 25 per cent to 30 per
cent.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paramount now switches to Viacom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Paramount Communications last night recommended shareholders
accept a new offer for the company from cable group Viacom rather than a
rival bid from QVC Network which directors had previously endorsed.
The board's switch will not decide the outcome of the five-month, Dollars
10bn takeover battle, since shareholders are free to accept whichever offer
they wish and both bidders have until February 1 to raise their offers. But
it gives Viacom a at least temporary psychological advantage.
Paramount agreed to merge with Viacom last September and continued to
recommend its offer until December when, after pressure from the courts, it
switched sides and advised shareholders to accept a then-superior QVC offer.
Viacom this week made a fresh offer worth about Dollars 9.8bn, below QVC's
Dollars 10.2bn offer. But a significant number of investors prefer the
Viacom bid as it offers more cash and has a mechanism guaranteeing the value
of the shares offered to Paramount stockholders.
Mr Martin Davis, Paramount chairman, said last night the board decided,
following analysis from its legal and financial advisers, that the aggregate
consideration in the Viacom offer represented the best value available to
stockholders 'at this time'.
However, he said the board was prepared to 'revisit its recommendation' if
further bids were received.
Meanwhile, Paramount is terminating its merger agreement with QVC and
reviving its previously agreed one with Viacom.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Complex game in the souk: Dominic Lawson goes looking for a
chess set and falls for the carpet gambit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abdullah, the handsome young major-domo at our loaned villa in Marrakesh,
shook his head when we told him we wanted to visit the souk. 'I would never
go there,' he said. 'As foreigners you will be pestered until you take on a
guide. Then he will take you only to the shops run by his contacts. It's all
side-deals and hidden commissions.'
'Don't worry,' I said, 'we can take care of ourselves. And my wife runs a
store in London. She knows all about profit margins.'
'Marrakesh is not London,' sighed Abdullah, 'but all right, I'll drive you
there.'
Of those would-be guides who pestered us at the entrance to the souk, we
took pity on one who rested on a crutch. Once inside the market we soon
realised that the main purpose of the crutch was to deliver stunning blows
to other guides who wanted to poach us.
'What you wanna buy?' asked our guide, panting from the effort of repeatedly
swinging his crutch above the perpendicular.
'A chess set,' I said.
'Another chess set,' corrected my wife.
'I take you to the best place,' said our guide, and, hobbling at a startling
pace, took us on a route which seemed to double back on itself several
times. Finally we arrived, possibly next door to where we had started, at a
shop which indeed, seemed to contain nothing but chess sets. They were all
of identical design, a reminder that it is not just observance of tradition,
but also fantastic lack of imagination, which ensures that the Islamic world
retains its medieval integrity.
'These chess sets are all the same,' I said to the shopkeeper.
'No,' he replied, 'they are in many different sizes.'
'They are all too small,' I said, irritably.
Then I heard my wife's shout from the basement of the shop. 'Come and look
at this]'
Downstairs was the biggest chess set I had ever seen, the pieces sitting
fatly on a board which must have been at least a yard square.
'Not too small?' inquired the shop owner.
'Not too small,' I said. The man named an exorbitant price.
Then I noticed a big crack in the board. 'It can be repaired,' said the
shopkeeper.
'No,' said my wife, in the tone of voice I imagine she uses with
manufacturers bringing in faulty goods. 'Make another one exactly this size,
and we will come back in a week to pick it up.'
A week later we arrived back at the shop. No giant chess set. The owner
wrung his hands. 'You see sir, we had your new set in the window, when a
member of the royal family walked by. He wanted it. And in this country,
when a member of the royal family wants something, he can just take it. Do
you have such problems with the royal family in your country?'
Not waiting for my reply, he suddenly brightened. 'So we hid your chess set.
And now I will take you to it.'
Another tortuous route found us in a carpet shop. The carpet shop owner sat
us down. 'The chess set will be ready in half an hour,' he said. 'Would you
like to see some carpets?'
'No,' we replied in unison.
The rest you can guess. After about half an hour of noeing we finally
cracked and shook hands on a deal to buy two carpets. At exactly that
moment, as the carpet man's hand gripped mine, two colleagues staggered into
the room bearing the missing chess board. 'Oh, what a surprise,' said my
wife.
At the door of the shop, an incredibly old looking man waited, attached to a
barrow on to which our chess board, pieces and carpets were loaded. Bent
low, he dragged our possessions out of the souk and towards our car.
Unfortunately no such service exists at Gatwick airport: we had to drag our
own booty towards and through the Red Channel of the Customs ourselves.
'What have we here?' asked the customs officer. We tried to explain. 'Some
of that lot attracts duty at 33 per cent,' he said, finally.
'Why so much?' I asked. The customs man looked at me, amazed at the fatuity
of the question. 'Protectionism,' he replied.
Where were you when we needed protecting, I thought. I did not say anything
so tactless, of course: I hoped to do a deal.

FT  22 JAN 94 / No place for pregnant fathers: Even new man is superfluous
at a birth. Nigel Spivey finds women know best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once there was feminism. Feminism spawned new man: such a different animal
from his predecessors that he had to be called 'partner' rather than
'husband'. New man was a thoughtful type, whose thoughts were attuned to the
more refined vibrations of feminine sensibility.
It was new man who could rustle up a quiche, or a foot massage; new man who
vacuumed up the mosaic of crushed foods from a toddlers' get-together; and
it was, almost as a matter of logical progression, new man who became a
stalwart of the maternity ward. So it is that what was exceptional 30 years
ago - a proto-father assisting at the labour - has become a normal social
obligation.
As one who had fully steeled himself to meet this obligation (having
mastered, after all, the many pitfalls of shortcrust pastry), I have
something to report. New man, go home. Yes, when it comes to the crunch of
childbirth there is no place for a man, not even a new one.
It is women's business: it is (as they say) women's 'space'. The authors of
the old British Medical Association booklets will be happily nodding at
this. They told us so. Stick to boiling kettles or pacing along the hospital
corridors with bouquets and champagne: that is what the men were ordained to
do, once upon a time.
But I have some bad news for the BMA, too. Their empire of obstetrics is
being seriously challenged by the same women who have rebuffed new man. The
practice of delivering babies from mothers in supine positions; the use of
forceps, and local anaesthetics; Caesarean sections, and other surgical
interventions, such as episiotomies - all these medical techniques have been
questioned or discarded by the exponents of natural birth.
Natural birth is not an entirely new philosophy. Its pioneer more than two
decade ago was Michel Odent, from whose clinic at Pithiviers in central
France emanated many of the non-medical strategies for women to give birth
'actively', that is, to give birth whilst moving about, or exercising, or
even swimming, without recourse to pain-killers (the body, according to
Odent, releases its own), and without ever being treated or manipulated as a
'patient' in a hospital bed.
If not novel, though, natural birth is still a dynamic philosophy. Thus as
feminism gives way to post-feminism, or even neo-feminism, and women find
that there are some ancient female preserves from which they would rather
not be emancipated, so the definition of what counts as 'natural' insofar as
men are concerned is also shifting.
Those new men with an eye on the barometer of changing intellectual climates
will perhaps have anticipated the eventual exclusion of men from the rituals
of a natural birth. If our sophisticated lives are still subject to certain
primal patterns and necessities, and if today's women should be practising
how to squat and crouch like their Neolithic grandmothers, then men, too,
should be obedient to the same olden protocols which kept childbirth amid an
extended sorority.
As Sheila Kitzinger, one of the leading gurus of natural birth, has pointed
out, the evidence from virtually all known primitive societies is that men
do not take part in the delivery of children. The menfolk of the Amazonian
tribes may go through some symbolically empathetic pain or drunkenness at
the time of labour, but they are not in attendance. The natural state of
affairs is for women to assist women.
The American psychologist Robert Bly implicitly signalled this change of
attitude more widely when he urged new men to put aside their recipe books
and go howling among the giant red-woods.
Iron John, Bly's mythical paradigm for what a man should be, would never
have traipsed along to an ante-natal clinic, to join in those frankly rather
undemanding exercises which pregnant women perform. Bly's 'inner warrior' is
not thereby acting with callous indifference - merely accepting that this is
a territory that women know best.
As indeed they do, which is why I have been happily marginalised from the
comprehensive preparations of the semi-official sisterhood currently
gathered about my wife. There is enough of the new man left in me to want to
be present at the nativity itself, but only for surplus moral support. I
shall be of no real use on the occasion, and that is how it should be.

<TEXT>
Is she a mad-woman? Should she be drummed out of the teaching profession and
flung into the Thames? Is the plague of political correctness spreading into
our primary schools and warping the minds of infants?
The answers to those questions will depend of which general newspaper you
read, for they relate to the case of Jane Brown, head teacher of Kingsmead
primary school in the east London borough of Hackney. Brown was splashed
across the newspapers this week because she had rejected an opportunity for
pupils to see the ballet Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Opera House.
According to most reports, the sole reason for her action was that she
regarded Romeo and Juliet as a 'blatantly heterosexual love story', and that
until books, films and plays reflected all forms of sexuality she was
disinclined to involve her pupils in 'heterosexual culture'.
The first I heard of the story was on TV on Wednesday. But the reports
sounded so galumphingly one-sided that on Thursday I bought a copy of every
UK national newspaper, to see whether the story was more complicated than it
sounded on TV.
It was, and the results of my survey reinforced my belief that the lower end
of the UK newspaper market is capable of such viciousness that it ought to
be subjected to a penal rate of VAT - the proceeds to be given to the
quality newspapers to subsidise their efforts at serious reporting.
I divided my pile of newspapers into three categories: qualities (Times,
Telegraph, Guardian, Independent); tabloids (Express, Mail, Today) and
testosteroids (produced by inadequates for the enjoyment of inadequates:
Sun, Mirror, Star).
With two minor exceptions, the tabloids and testosteroids reported the story
as one thing only: an example of loony-left philistinism and creeping
political correctness. Said the Star: 'A loony school head rejected
cut-price tickets for her pupils to see Romeo and Juliet - because it WASN'T
a gay love story.' The Mirror's headline: 'Head Bans 'Hetero' Romeo and
Juliet.' The Sun's: 'Romeo, Romeo, Where Art Thou Homo?'
Only in the Sun and Today was an inkling provided that there may have been
other reasons why the head teacher felt disinclined to send her tots to
Romeo and Juliet.
To discover what those were, you had to turn to the qualities. The
Independent's story was stumpy and poor - almost as one-sided as the tabs'
and the testos'. Only in the Telegraph and Guardian was the complexity of
the story allowed to show through.
Said the Telegraph: 'While Hackney leaders, who have been trying to soften
the council's left-wing image, were furious, Ms Brown's colleagues defended
her. One said: 'She is not trying to promote homosexuality. All she was
trying to do was to prevent the children being fed a constant diet of gang
fights and killing. The school is on the edge of a notorious estate and
showing children yet more male stereotyping, feuding and knives is no joke.'
Perhaps, at day's end, opinion will settle in favour of John McCafferty,
Hackney council's leader - he is also a teacher of English  - who was quoted
as calling Brown an 'irresponsible individual' guilty of an 'absurd,
narrow-minded Californian concept of political correctness'.
On Thursday, the head teacher said she was 'dismayed at the distress I have
caused to parents, staff and pupils by the unwelcome media attention which
has focused on the school.' And she told a Hackney council inquiry that her
action had been 'wholly inappropriate'.
But by then the affair had been clouded by the media's rush to judgment.
Brown sounds to me like someone trying to perform a difficult job with
sensitivity - a victim of media shafting.
Does it matter? Yes, it does. Include the FT, and the UK qualities sold
2,432,993 copies last month. Combined, the tabloids and testosteroids sold
10,493,306 copies. The tabs and the testos outsell the qualities by 4.31:1.
If you ask me, a lot of the blame for the intolerance and viciousness and
ignorance and stupidity that we notice all around us derives from that
dreadful ratio.
The government must act. A simple little VAT rate - 33 per cent, perhaps a
touch more - on the tabs and the testos would suffice. This is a challenge
for Michael Portillo: a chance to show us he is more than a mouth.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER

<TEXT>
Choosing a career can be tough if you are born rich, and ashamed of it. So
George Ortiz was at a loss to know what to do when the family business was
nationalised.
Since the family business was tin-mining in Bolivia and his mother's father
was Simon Patino, one of the richest men in the world, young George found
himself with several millions to deal with. He decided to make a career out
of a hobby.
He became a collector of antiquities, transmuting tin into bronze, copper
and gold. Today he is acknowledged as having reached the top of his
profession: the cream of his collection, shown last year in St Petersburg
and Moscow, this week went on display at the Royal Academy in London.
There I found him, a slight figure, frenetic and wide-eyed, scuttling
between his beautiful possessions like a nervous hostess before a dinner
party.
Collecting is an odd sort of job, I thought, and collectors odd sort of
people. I said: you have described it as a kind of odyssey.
'Certainly,' he replied. 'And I cannot explain it. I can try to rationalise
it, but it was an unconscious process, emotional, as though I'd built a work
of art, as though I'd brought up a child. And suddenly it's reached maturity
and I exhibit: it all comes together, it's a harmonious whole.'
Is your life in this collection, or is it a hobby?
'That's a very interesting question. It may have been the answer to personal
need. It may be a hobby. But I think it's much more than that. It's perhaps
a frustration at not having been able to work in the family business.'
You could have taken a job.
'I could have, yes, but I was told my responsibility and duty was to my
grandfather. I should have had the courage, perhaps, to go out and do
something else but I didn't. So the only thing I have been able to do
entirely on my own has become my fortune.'
Is it bad for young people to inherit a lot of money?
'If they are very well balanced, well brought up, no. But there is no doubt
that adversity is the mother of progress and to be born privileged
financially makes you start with a tremendous handicap.'
Ortiz agreed he was paralysed by his money until he found an outlet. But is
collecting a career?
'In my case, exceptionally, I think one could say it is. I think - I don't
want to be pretentious - that the same way you have Mozart or Michelangelo
who are gifted to create their great works, I have not that gift but a
certain eye, the gift to perceive what artists have put into something.'
I suggested, ungenerously, it was easy to have a good eye if you had the
money to practise it. He said antiquities were not so expensive when he
began and he'd had to work hard to find them. 'I loved rally-driving when I
was young. My dream has always been to have a Ferrari, and I've never had
one my whole life because each time it's been an antiquity instead.'
About 90 per cent of his wealth is tied up in the collection. 'Nowadays my
total capital, stocks, shares, bonds, apart from my home and the art is far
less than some great fortunes have as income in one year - far, far less.'
I asked about provenance, a controversial subject in the antiquities market
these days. Have you ever had your fingers burned?
'Er, no. I'm very careful.' Anticipating the next question, he added: 'Man
has always collected since time immemorial, and always will. Collections are
at the basis of all our museums and all our studies of these cultures.'
There's the question of authenticity . . .
'Oh, not in my case. I'm sure. Nobody has questioned any of my objects.'
Was spending all that money on primitive objects a gesture, a statement
about wealth?
'I don't know. You're psycho-analysing me now. Maybe. Maybe.'
You were getting value for money but getting rid of the money, too?
'It's very possible. That's a very pertinent statement and I wouldn't argue
it.'
Did you feel oppressed by the wealth of your mother's family?
'Oh, I certainly suffered as a child. I was too sensitive and I felt the
difference was too vast. This sounds ludicrous and people will think I'm
absolutely mad but when when I was really young I was perfectly willing to
contemplate that both my parents and myself be eliminated, physically
irradiated, to make for a better world. Of course it was madness.'
Ortiz explained that a youthful flirtation with Marxism had evaporated in
the face of ideological freaks such as Pol Pot.
But there are other kinds of madness, I reflected, to which a collector
might be prone. Ortiz describes his first encounters with some objects as
'emotional, instantaneous, visceral'. That's called falling in love, I said.
'It's like falling in love. But afterwards it's completely different.' The
desire faded, leaving appreciation behind.
Ortiz has written as if some objects were destined to come to him. I asked:
When does appreciation turn into covetousness?
'Oh, I don't think I've ever coveted in that sense. Don't you think I have
enough? I've lost two or three objects I thought I really deserved to have
to nouveau-riche collectors.
'But that's life. I'm going to die soon and be separated from my objects. I
get just as much appreciation out of seeing a marvellous object in a museum
or even in other collections.'
Aren't you possessive?
'I feel possessive in the sense I feel responsible for my objects. And I
look after them as though they were my life itself - even better. I feel
responsible to keep them for civilisation.'
Where is the line between love and mania?
'Oh, I don't think I have any mania. Sadly in a way, and marvellously in a
way, this exhibition is enabling me to outgrow the collection.'
How do you mean?
'It's now fulfiled its mission as far as I'm concerned. I hope it fulfils
its mission for the world. I hope the visitors get nourishment out of it. I
hope they all find something that satisfies them, that makes them leave
enriched in some way, happier . . .'
You can imagine living without it, or dying and leaving it behind?
'Oh, of course. I must not be attached to any of these works of art when my
time comes to die.'
Ortiz rhapsodizes about the spirit of the ancient Greeks which started him
on his voyage. He is just as eloquent when castigating the materialism of
the modern age: accumulation for the sake of status and power.
But you have been accumulating, I said.
'I'm not accumulating for accumulation's sake. I'm accumulating because I'm
building up a collection that is an answer to a need and is a message.'
Your gratification is involved . . .
'It's a personal answer to a personal need, but I wouldn't call it
gratification. Not like gratifying a need to drink, or eating too much, or
too much sex, but gratification in accomplishing something in the best way
you can.' It was the gratification felt by men like Henry Ford, or Citroen
or the architect Pei. 'I think mine is creativity. It carries a message.'
Ortiz becomes breathless when describing the message he says his collection
 -his creation - is conveying to mankind: it is one of understanding, hope,
dignity, responsibility, idealism, the common humanity of us all.
Other millionaires, I said, would buy a newspaper, start a foundation or a
university. Yours is an unusual way to make a political point.
'It's totally unusual. But you see those others are great businessmen or
entrepreneurs who have made huge fortunes and then want to do something for
their name or out of idealism, or out of guilt. Or they want to have some
power or influence.
'But I haven't created an empire, I haven't built up a financial dynasty. So
instead of being able to paint or sculpt, perhaps, or become a politician
for reasons of being uprooted . . . I've done this.
Did it start as a selfish exercise and only later become spiritual?
'Selfish is a little bit harsh and a little unfair but you could put it that
way, yes. It certainly was centred on self, then I saw that the answer I had
found to my anguish, my questioning, were the answer for all men. In other
words, the answer to our problems is not with the system. It's
responsibility, dignity, self-respect, respect for the other. If you don't
come to peace with yourself and love yourself, you can't love anybody else.'
You should have been a clergyman, perhaps.
'No, because I don't like preaching. I want to show people, but people must
perceive by themselves.'
Although brought up a Roman Catholic, George Ortiz is an agnostic who -
unlike the authors of the figures he has collected - expects no after-life.
'All gods are the invention of man in front of the anguish of death,' he
said. 'I accept I disappear, but the future will have me in it.'
He says he will not sell his collection before he dies but leave it to his
four children to dispose of if they need to. All have had the best
educations. At their father's urging, the three sons, George, Oliver and
Nicholas, are learning to become streetwise: they have set up a store in
Vilnius, Lithuania, which employs 100. The daughter, Graziella, is at
university in the US.
I asked if he had made sacrifices.
'Sacrifices, no. How can one talk of sacrifice when one is as privileged and
well off as I am? But in the sense of choices I've sacrificed family life,
travelling, holidays, all sorts of things. You don't achieve - I don't mean
to be pretentious - this degree of perfection in such an ensemble without,
like Churchill said during the war, blood, sweat and tears.'
What keeps you awake at night?
'Nothing.'
Not people stealing from you?
'No. I don't even insure. I can't afford it. It's life. Tomorrow the plane I
take can crash. I could go in a store and a terrorist bomb goes off. It's
life.'
Is this the attitude of a man who is not self-made - who can say 'easy come,
easy go'?
'Possibly. It may relate to what you asked me about money earlier, spending
it on objects. I may have . . .' He searched for words.
A secret distaste for wealth?
'For wealth, but not for elitism.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Light out of darkness - Fragile survivors of the
Middles Ages collected in Cologne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is an exhibition to make you pinch yourself in case it is a dream.
There are no fewer than 70 north European panel paintings of the late 14th
and 15th centuries. Roughly half of these fragile survivors from the Middle
Ages and early Renaissance have been loaned from other museums and a handful
still belong to private collections. There are vestments and manuscripts,
including the delightful little Darmstadt Book of Hours which Lochner, the
most admired German artist before Durer, illuminated.
So obscure is Lochner, and so little represented outside German collections,
that this extraordinary exhibition is like a laboratory assembled so that
art-historians can test their hypotheses. Who were this innovative artist's
teachers and models? Who were his fellow-pupils, and whom did he teach?
These questions justify the exhibition, so the public has reason to feel
grateful. At the same time, this is also an exhibition which displays a more
profound contempt for the lay visitor than any I have ever seen.
Apart from labels saying 'Upper Rhine', 'Italy', 'Followers', and so on,
there is not a shred of information inside the gallery. Outside there are
tediously slow interactive videos. Unless you read German and feel like
balancing the hardback catalogue on your arm, you could leave the exhibition
knowing little more about Lochner and his contemporaries than when you
arrived.
He was born near Lake Constance and died in Cologne in 1451, a prosperous
master who invested his wealth in real estate. Probably he died from the
Black Death, which wiped out half the population of this exceedingly rich
city. Details of Lochner's life and work are conjectural and not one signed
painting survives. A few years ago, an heretical scholar even suggested that
the famous 'Adoration of the Magi' altarpiece in Cologne Cathedral is not by
Lochner. (It hardly needs saying that a trip to see this is a must.)
To the Wallraf-Richartz Museum's own collection of works by Lochner have
been added many others. My favourite was the 'Presentation in the Temple'
from the Gulbenkian Museum, which shows Lochner's gift for tenderness and
his original way with themes. Simeon looks at the lively, golden-haired
Christ Child in his arms with an expression which is grave and full of
foreboding. Contemporaries would have known to supply his words, 'Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.'
Frankfurt has loaned the two wings of the 'Martyrdom of the Apostles'. In 12
small panels, Lochner achieved the gayest, most varied compositions out of
the horrible litany of torture. These apostles surely sang as they died and
their executioners have the grace of dancers. The gold backgrounds and solid
haloes were the hallmark of the Cologne school. Arriving there in about
1430, Lochner wisely made it his own.
So much gold can become monotonous, particularly in comparison with Flemish
contemporary painters like Flemalle and Robert Campin, with their views
through windows onto landscapes and lively street scenes. The exhibition
shows how long it took for Cologne's burghers and churchmen to change their
view that paintings, like statues and books, should be gleaming and
hieratic, a foretaste of heaven.
The greatest Flemish masters are also represented by loans to the
exhibition. There are a half-dozen wonderful paintings by Jan Van Eyck (the
'St Jerome' from Detroit), Petrus Christus, Robert Campin and Rogier van der
Weyden (the lovely panel from Leipzig of the meeting of SS. Elizabeth and
Mary, both heavily pregnant).
There are guided tours which will give you the sadistic pleasure of standing
en bloc in front of important pictures such as Lochner's 'Last Judgment',
hung in a central bottle-neck, and preventing anyone else getting a look in
for minutes at a time.
The longest wait will probably be to see the magnificent triptych on the
last wall. It is not by Lochner but by an artist who, to my mind, is his
superior. Memling's 'Last Judgment' is a sublime vision of terror and
beauty.
Why does this masterpiece appear in the show? Because Memling was Rogier van
der Weyden's pupil, and accompanied him to Cologne where, like many other
artists, he looked hard at Lochner's 'Last Judgment'. However, Memling's
vision is far more novel and compelling than the Cologne master's. Here are
no feebly literal jaws of hell, no bloated bodies or condign punishments.
This is a hell of sickening vertigo in which elegant bodies plummet into
stygian smoke and flame. On the left side, the blessed walk up a glass
staircase of breathtaking beauty. A grey-haired man bobs a curtsey as St
Peter shakes his hand. At the top, angels slip sumptuous garments over
people's heads. Memling's vision is the grandest finale to an exhibition
which, despite its lack of information about the pictures on show, will
beckon to anyone who loves the northern Renaissance.

27 February, 1994. For information on Cologne, including hotel-bookings and

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Well tuned to Boccherini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Quatuor Mosaques, four young 'period' string-players of unrivalled
excellence, is briefly in residence at the Wigmore Hall with a four-day
mini-festival devoted to the chamber music of Haydn and Boccherini that
should bring happiness to all who sample it.
Haydn and the Italian-born, Spain-based Boccherini were contemporaries.
Their fame in the later 18th century spread comparably, if differently,
wide. Both were hugely prolific. For these reasons and many others besides,
numerous parallels between the two have long been drawn by chamber-music
historians, invariably to Haydn's greater glory.
The bounteous pleasures of Thursday's opening concert were supplied equally
by the beauty of the music and the justness of its evaluation - with
performers like these, style- and period-conscious not merely in their
sound-producing traits but in their effortlessly intimate approach to
ensemble performance, there was never any danger of Haydn's greatness
obliterating the lesser figure.
Two Boccherini string quintets framing the programme, with the Belgian
cellist Roel Dieltens as fifth voice, exposed with the most subtle interplay
of parts the elegantly musical personality that underlies all of his
choicest creations. Today, when charm is a characteristic widely despised
and 'aggressive' more often than not an adjective of praise, there is a
temptation to scoff at the ripely civilised qualities of a work such as the
C major Quintet, Op 28 no. 4.
Here, in a reading of exquisite gentleness which constantly searched out the
softest, sweetest modes of audience address, the most graceful tones of
voice in the singing of Boccherini's delightful melodies, that temptation
was immediately banished. The Mosaques encouraged the listener to admire to
the full the genial virtuosity of the part-writing, with its delicate
evocations of Spanish guitar consorts and intriguing blends of violin
texture.
And even if the quartet's performance of Haydn's farewell to string-quartet
composition, the two-movement 'torso' numbered Op. 103, had earlier raised
the listener to an entirely different level of musical experience, it
remained possible afterwards to appreciate Boccherini according to his
genuine, palpable merits.
Wigmore Hall, London W1: series sponsored by Friends of Wigmore Hall; final
concert tomorrow evening

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Sheppard in a minor key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is commonly held that as a jazz musician you must pay your dues before
moving into the premier league: you have to earn the right to do your own
thing. British saxophonist Andy Sheppard has worn out more than a few reeds
on the way up and is now expressing himself vigorously and variously all
over the place. Last Saturday his Small Co-Motion - a duo with keyboard
player and composing partner Steve Lodder - filled Norwich Arts Centre. A
new and funky recording from the quintet In Co-Motion is out now on Blue
Note and a live recording of the 10-piece Big Co-Motion is released next
month.
Sheppard likes to chop around. In Paris he used to play on forklift trucks
with performance art troupe Urban Sax. He sits on the front row of
adventurous big bands led by George Russell and Carla Bley and plays
opposite pianist Keith Tippett in turbulent free improvisation. Last year
Big Co-Motion travelled to Nigeria and Outer Mongolia on British Council
tours.
For his foray into the Near East, however, Sheppard came equipped for
congenial self-indulgence and intimate riffing with Lodder's synth. Opening
with the soprano and a swarming bee tone layered over twinkling
accompaniment before moving on to the soulless fuzz metal effect of the Ewi
(electronic wind instrument), Sheppard showed his considerable firepower.
Dank soprano improvisation with delay gave way to well punctuated excursions
from Lodder and some tenor madness.
But minor key ruminations were the theme for most of the evening. Linear
improvisation run along a repeating and recurring folky mantra is a feature
of much jazz, and indeed modern music in general. The melancholic, wistful
effect created by Sheppard and Lodder here is mildly stimulating because
they are both fine musicians. But, as if you had been listening in to two
friends jamming gently at home, you do not go away with much of substance to
remember. Sheppard is always good value in any shape or form - however
blurred the outline. But his solo exertions in the context of a fierce brass
section and the exhilarating writing of the Big Co-Motion are more
rewarding.
Small Co-Motion at the Blackheath concert halls tonight. Big Co-Motion at
the Barbican, February 25.

It is strange to reflect that Italy was the cradle of ballet, before the
French and Russians adopted it. Right up until the beginning of this
century, Italian dancers were the most eminent stars in the ballet world,
and Italian ballet training perhaps the most influential.
Today, Italian ballet training has no high standing. Alessandra Ferri and
Viviana Durante, two of the world's leading female dancers, are Italians who
came to London to complete their training and to launch their international
careers.
How odd, then, to see the Birmingham Royal Ballet, an unstellar ensemble
dancing Frederick Ashton's unglamorous classic La Fille mal gardee in Turin
last weekend. Not all seats were filled; some Torinese opera subscribers
chose not to occupy their seats. And those who attended did not at first
know how to react. Could a ballet really be this rural and comic and
touching and humane? Could dance steps really be arranged with this much
intricacy? Could so much tender detail be poured into a work whose plot is
so simple? Could sophisticated Northern Italians enjoy something as homespun
as this?
The answer was yes - eventually. The opening performance was, by all
accounts, politely received, no more. At the second performance, large
numbers of the audience were sufficiently delighted to rush forward to the
stage, to bathe in the dancers' radiance as they applauded. The next day the
critics of the Corriere della Sera, Giornale, and La Stampa proclaimed the
opening performance of Fille to have been a triumph, delicious, a joy.
One must compliment Peter Wright, the BRB's artistic director, on using La
Fille as his calling-card. Last year the Royal Ballet (the Covent Garden
branch) came to Turin with Mayerling and Anthony Dowell's stagings of Swan
Lake - productions that you would have thought anyone could tell would fail
on the European continent. The BRB is not the better company - La Fille is
danced slightly better by the Covent Garden ensemble - but many Torinese
certainly now think it is. Certainly La Fille becomes the Birmingham
dancers; I have not admired this troupe's dancing so much for several years.
Ashton's skill in characterisation was the most remarked-upon feature of the
ballet; with especial delight found in the travesty playing of the grouchy
but warm-hearted Widow Simone ('la mamma') and the happy simpleton Alain.
But people also exclaimed with amazement that never before had they seen
ballet with the harmony, structure, and fluency of music - that watching it
was like reading a score. I, who have probably seen La Fille over 60 times,
found myself discovering new felicities in its construction - and yet
envying those were discovering it for the first time.
During my brief visit, I was able to watch the company's first two casts.
Irek Mukhamedov, a guest star from Covent Garden, danced Colas. He had a few
more problems with the steps than when he first took the role at Covent
Garden two years ago, and he forces a few features of the characterisation.
But you could still feel the virile charm and Bolshoi sweep that makes
Mukhamedov so immensely impressive a dancer.
Tiny, pert, Sandra Madgwick was his Lise. The sharp coloratura of her
dancing, the impetuous fun of her playing have made her a splendid inheritor
of this role since her student days. Perhaps she is at times too sharp, too
shy of bringing out the melting lyricism of the ballet's more lovelorn
passages; but her dancing is as naturally brilliant as birdsong. David Morse
and Vincent Redmon, as Simone and Alain, gave performances that at all
points made the ballet's detail (and thereby its entire world) more real.
The second cast, by one of those happy flukes, had several more flaws and
yet was altogether even more delightful. Dorcas Walters lacks all the
finesse for Lise's dances, but the brightness of her jump on the one hand
and the gentleness of her playing on the other makes her performance varied
and absorbing; Sergiu Poberezhnic, attentive but weak as a partner and
generous but tense as a soloist, has tremendous warmth and youthful panache
as Colas; Edwin Mota was an exaggerated but sweet Alain. And Michael O'Hare
was a marvellous Simone; I have not seen the episode when he suddenly wakes
and blearily snaps straight back into action so vividly done for many years.
Above and beyond any of the dancers, I praise the company's young conductor
Philip Ellis. Each time I hear him, I think he is the best thing to have
happened to British ballet music since the late Ashley Lawrence. He shapes
the music of such minor composers as Auber, Herold, and Minkus with the
brio, love, and finesse it deserves; he lends sparkle to otherwise weak
dancers; and to precise dancers he gives stimulus and power. Playing under
him, the orchestra of Turin's Teatro Reggio gave the score unusual elegance
and wit.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Scorsese the celluloid crusader - Nigel Andrews asks
the director why he has exchanged blood and bullets for Merchant-Ivory
finery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When people heard that Martin Scorsese was to film Edith Wharton's novel The
Age Of Innocence (opening in Britain next week), it was open day for the
jokesters. 'Raging bull in a china shop]' cracked some. 'Genteelfellas]'
quipped others. We live in a world where directors are typecast as much as
film stars: so what was a man famed for spraying audiences with blood and
bullets doing making a film for the James Ivory school of fin-de-siecle
finery?
Scorsese fans have long claimed him as the most inventive and visceral
director in modern America: the man who in films like Mean Streets and Taxi
Driver turned film grammar on its head and showed that cogent storytelling
could go hand-in-hand with dazzling stylistic adventurism. Scorsese in
person is a small, manic, dapper man with machine-gun speech patterns. Ask
him why he was drawn to Wharton's turn-of-the-century tale of high society
and best behaviour - of hearts never allowed to show they are broken - and
he quickly shoots holes in the stereotyped image of himself.
'There are different types of film I'm interested in making, and they're not
necessarily the kind I made in the 1970s. It's twenty years since I made
Mean Streets] Age Of Innocence came out of a reflective period in my life,
when I wanted to make a 'romantic' film. At the same time I wanted to find a
modern way to tell a period story.'
Modern - but let no one rush off to the movie expecting 'F'-words or Robert
De Niro crashing through the French windows waving an automatic. By modern
Scorsese means - well, what he has always meant. 'You don't just film the
material. You re-interpret every scene through the lens. Where do you want
the audience to look? How do you begin a sequence? At what point?
'In a scene where Daniel Day-Lewis (as hero Newland Archer) is talking to
his lawyer, we start with a gigantic close-up of a cigar being clipped and
then puffed on. Then we have a wide angle of the room in which the camera
comes flying to an over-the-shoulder shot; then . . .' And so forth. You
have to see the disruption of costume-movie camera etiquette in The Age Of
Innocence to believe it - and to believe that it can work.
But with Scorsese the camera has always been a St Vitus presence. The place
where he did change his habits for the new film was in the dialogue and
performances.
'What fascinates me about the time Wharton wrote about, that period of New
York high society, is that people edited their thoughts before they spoke.
In Raging Bull or Mean Streets or even Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More
there's no such editing. People come right out with their thoughts, often to
the detriment of the person who said it - 'I didn't mean that, I meant
this]' With Wharton's people every word is carefully chosen. There's this
intensity of restraint.'
Hence the casting call to British actors to fill out Wharton's tale of a
rich, emotionally repressed New Yorker (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose friends and
family (Alec McCowen, Miriam Margolyes, Richard E. Grant . . .) look on
aghast as he falls for a divorced Polish countess, played by the film's
almost lone American Michelle Pfeiffer.
But The Age Of Innocence seems less un-Scorsese-ish a project the more one
ponders it. The way people express or fail to express their feelings - in an
arc all the way from the cataracts of street gab of De Niro's Johnny Boy in
Mean Streets to the lumbering inarticulacy of De Niro again in Raging Bull -
is the heart of his cinema. These heroes, or anti-heroes, use words as fists
and fists as words. They grow up in a big city milieu where survival
requires the interchangeable use of mental wit and physical weaponry.
Scorsese to this day does not see his reputation-making film Taxi Driver - a
'vision of Hell' according to some critics - as anything but a realistic
picture of New York City. 'All the images seen through the De Niro
character's eyes, you could say, yes, they add up to one of the nine circles
of Hell. Or to Purgatory. There's a religious element there. 'I'm God's
lonely man' Travis (De Niro) says, and Paul Schrader (the scriptwriter)
based his script on Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground.
'But for me, I made the film because I knew how this man felt. You have
these feelings of exasperation, of helplessness, in a city like New York.
Everybody's wrong, nobody's right] Everybody's right, nobody's wrong] There
are the racial problems and the injustices . . . it's a city caving in,
eating itself up. How do you survive? How do you stop killing yourself and
taking people with you?'
It is a world Scorsese himself grew up in, and for years he floundered with
his own crisis of response and identity. As a teenager he wanted to go into
the church, but found that he kept going into cinemas instead. 'It was a
refuge, in a way, a dream. Or a 'dream state'. It was a place to go and rest
and explore your own emotions through other stories and other characters. It
was a catharsis for me, like moving paintings.'
And paintings keep coming up during conversation. He gave up the altar to
move into the arts; but what kind of artist would he have been if born
before the age of cinema? 'A painter.' And why does he find so much
inspiration still in old churches? 'Because frescoes were an early form of
cinema. You know, 'Here is the resurrection, over there is Hell.' And people
would criticise it like a movie. 'Oh it's much too gory, too violent] We
don't need that sort of thing in a church]''
As for the longest answer he gives me during our whole conversation, that
too is about painting: his search to find the right pictures for people's
houses in The Age Of Innocence. It led him, in a pilgrimage towards dramatic
truth, all the way from period accuracy - consulting the New York Historical
Society to find out what artworks the real-life prototypes for Wharton's
characters actually owned - to a sophisticated cinematic symbol-patterning.
One example is the character whose staircase is lined with paintings by the
Hudson Valley artists. 'I thought that up with the designer Dante Ferretti.
As you go up the stairs, you're taking a trip up the Hudson Valley, finally
ending on a scalping, which puts everything else in perspective about polite
American society at that time]'
For Scorsese violence is the subtext of life - or American life - however
much the social or cultural surface may camouflage it. He experienced that
hidden violence himself three years ago, when good manners in the Bible Belt
buckled like an earth tremor over his film The Last Temptation Of Christ.
'I was very surprised,' he says, 'at the level of emotion and confused
information that response to the film brought about. In France they burned
theatres; in America I had death threats. I knew there'd be controversy, but
I hoped that out of that, religious concepts would be discussed
intelligently around the world. Not just Christianity but other religions. I
think more films should be made in the West about Islam; so people get to
understand the lifestyle of Arabs, ancient and modern. It would help to
dispel the fears of an isolated country like America.'
Scorsese's evangelistic view of movies does not stop here. Indeed it does
not stop anywhere. One senses a crusading or religious spirit informing
nearly all his perspectives on cinema. Asked what happened to the impulses
he once planned to put into the priesthood, he does not hesitate to say they
went into his films. 'If you have a gift, the actual working out of that
gift is a form of prayer. It's a religious act.' And asked what special
power cinema has beyond other arts, he has a missionary answer.
'Imagery is such a powerful thing. I was lecturing on film preservation
around the time when the Holocaust exhibition opened in Washington. And all
week they'd been showing documentaries of the period, and I said 'Imagine if
all this film hadn't been preserved]' In a funny way, you can read all the
books you want, but to see one photographic or moving image of what happened
 -the famous shot of the Nazi with the riding crop under the chin of the old
woman, forcing her to look up - that alone says so much to future
generations. That's what the power of film is.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Cultural tug-of-war divides Scots - The row over
Scotland's new National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The room was designed to seat 250; in the event, 1,000 turned up. University
lecturers in tweed jackets stood alongside old ladies in mackintoshes, young
women tending babies and at least one judge of the court of session at the
meeting earlier this week to protest against the decision by the National
Galleries of Scotland to locate a new gallery not in the Scottish capital,
but in Glasgow.
It was the climax of a controversy which has been the chief talking point of
Scotland's chattering classes since early December. Each day there have been
broadsides in the letters and features pages of The Scotsman. Last week its
Glasgow rival The Herald devoted four pages to the issue. Next week it will
be debated in the House of Lords.
The controversy involves not just art but Scottish nationalism and the
perpetual rivalry of Scotland's two biggest cities.
It concerns a plan to create a National Gallery of Scottish Art, intended to
tell the history of Scotland and its art. It will take paintings by Scottish
artists from two Edinburgh galleries, the National Gallery of Scotland on
The Mound, and the Gallery of Modern Art. It will also absorb the entire
Scottish National Portrait Gallery, also in Edinburgh, which will close. The
new institution will be built at Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow.
The idea of creating a National Gallery of Scottish Art was launched in 1991
by Timothy Clifford, the ebullient Englishman who is director of the
National Galleries of Scotland, and by Angus Grossart, the terse merchant
banker who is chairman of the galleries' trustees.
It sprang from a desire to relieve the serious shortage of space in the
Edinburgh galleries, which means that paintings by Scottish artists have to
be taken down to provide space for exhibitions, while hundreds of Scottish
paintings lie in store.
The Portrait Gallery's collection of paintings of leading Scotsmen and women
over the centuries would form the nucleus of the new gallery, blended with
other paintings by Scottish artists such as Raeburn, Wilkie and Cadell from
the National Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art. It would tell the
history of Scotland visually. Landscape paintings would illustrate
Scotland's geology and topography.
At the time Clifford said Edinburgh was the most logical place for the new
gallery, but added: 'It is up to Glasgow to come up with wonderful
proposals. We are ready to be seduced.'
That is exactly what happened. Whereas Edinburgh reacted sluggishly, Glasgow
with typical assertiveness offered the trustees several locations, promised
to lend the new gallery some of its best paintings and commissioned
architects such as Sir Norman Foster and Terry Farrell to produce designs.
Glasgow consistently made the running: a consultants' study showed that on
economic grounds Glasgow was the best location: the sites were cheaper, the
population was bigger and the existing Kelvingrove art gallery and museum
had higher attendances than the Edinburgh galleries.
The ten trustees repeatedly postponed a decision. But in the end the
economic arguments for Glasgow, reinforced by the knowledge that the
trustees represent Scotland rather than Edinburgh (several of them come from
Glasgow) made Kelvingrove inevitable. It was announced on November 30.
People in Edinburgh reacted with horror to what had happened. The decision
meant that some of the best-loved paintings would leave Edinburgh for
Glasgow. Raeburn's famous picture of the Reverend Robert Walker skating on
Duddingston Loch - which the gallery uses as its logo - would go for some
years to Kelvingrove.
The rights and wrongs of a National Gallery of Scottish Art had been debated
intermittently since 1991. Now the arguments against it came pouring out.
They boil down to two.
First, the new institution would mean herding Scottish art into a ghetto. As
Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow's Art Galleries, said in 1991 (he has
since changed his mind) the most successful galleries in other countries try
to cross-fertilise the art of different nations rather than separating them
into compartments.
By the same token it would severely weaken the National Gallery. Though the
gallery has listed those Scottish paintings that will stay, art historian
Duncan Macmillan says the Scottish collections should be the heart of the
National Gallery. 'Without them it becomes the National Gallery of Nowhere
in Particular, or perhaps the International Gallery of Anywhere Else but
Scotland.'
Secondly, the new institution means destroying the Portrait Gallery, created
in 1889 and one of only three in the world. Paul Scott, a leading
campaigner, calls it one of the most treasured possessions of the Scottish
people: it should be kept intact and remain in the Scottish capital. It is
this which arouses the strongest feelings.
At this week's public meeting Clifford defended his plan and Spalding
pricked a few consciences when he asked: 'If the Portrait Gallery was
closing and if Edinburgh had been successful in the bid it made (to have the
new gallery) would you all be here tonight?'
Edinburgh campaigners say they do not object to a new gallery being built
somewhere else, even Glasgow, but with a different configuration. But they
voted overwhelmingly for the trustees to reconsider or resign. None of the
trustees was present.
Yet even if the trustees stick to their decision it is far from certain that
the new gallery will go ahead. The Scottish Office has said that it will not
contribute to the Pounds 20m cost. Glasgow may stand a better chance than
Edinburgh of qualifying for EU funding but this is far from certain.
Grossart talks of tapping private donors and getting money from the National
Lottery or the Millennium Fund. But it is difficult to believe that the
government, which will control those funds, would direct them to a project
which so many people oppose.
Increasingly eyes are turning to Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. He has
the final say and could veto the scheme or order a review. To many people,
possibly including some of the trustees, that might come as a relief.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Small fish in a big pond - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Thatcher liked the idea of her statue mounted above the English
entrance to the Channel tunnel - 'Britannia resisting the Continental
Hordes', perhaps. But Eurotunnel, niggled by her failure to provide
Government cash for the enterprise, ignored the suggestion. Now the greatest
building project of the century seems doomed to be completed with only a
minimal contribution from the artists of the age.
But when passengers start to arrive at Waterloo later this summer to catch
the direct train to Paris, they will be greeted in Nicholas Grimshaw's award
winning new terminal with one lone, but striking, work of art - 'Channel
Fish' by the French artist Jean-Luc Vilmouth.
Vilmouth is the winner of a competition organised by Public Art, the group
responsible for locating art in the environment, against competition from,
among 80 others, Ron Haseldon, Simon Patterson, and Peter Greenaway. The
French artist's concept is piscine - fish made of steel mesh coated with
fibre glass and suspended from the ceiling. These are not static fish. They
wriggle, and to spectators in the first floor waiting room they will
resemble a shoal of fish weaving in formation down the curve of Grimshaw's
opaque building.
At the moment five fish, varying in length from three to five metres, are
guaranteed, thanks to a Pounds 70,000 contribution from the BR subsidiary
looking after the rail link, European Passenger Services, boosted with
Pounds 24,000 under the government funded Business Sponsorship Incentive
Scheme. But an extra Pounds 40,000 is needed to acquire another five fish to
make up a decent shoal, and companies likely to profit from the Tunnel are
being approached for support.
The fish are sand eels, a delicacy in France but not familiar in the UK.
Vilmouth is best known for an installation in Grenoble, 70 metres long and
featuring hammers pattering on to clocks. Public works of art are compulsory
in official buildings in France; this has led to much bad art but also a
tradition of municipal and corporate patronage.
In the UK, public art is still not widely accepted but this could be
changing. The Pounds 1m invested by Stuart Lipton in sculptures for his
Broadgate development in London has more than paid for themselves in prompt
lettings and popular approval, while Birmingham's International Convention
Centre is another successful project heavily endowed with art, selected by
Public Art.
It remains a reproach to all involved that the sole artistic haul from the
Channel tunnel is half a dozen French fish.
*
It was always predicted that 1994 would be the year that the arts would
suffer from lower government and local authority grants, reduced
sponsorship, and falling box office revenue. The consequences have arrived
early.
As usual the smallest have come off worst. Ten arts organisations in London,
including Double Edge theatre group, Greenwich Mural Workshop, and Islington
Arts Factory, have lost their London Arts Board grants. The LAB, faced with
a 2.25 per cent reduction from the Arts Council, has kept things ticking
over with standstill grants for most of its 140 clients. A few special
cases, such as the Drill Hall and Camden Arts Centre, get good uplifts, but
it is curtains for the ten. Timothy Mason, LAB's chief executive, is trying
to bolster regional arts groups in the capital at the expense of small
neighbourhood activists.
At the other extreme Jeremy Isaacs, general director at Covent Garden, must
decide soon whether to drop one of the most awaited productions of the
season, Puccini's La fanciulla del West, with Domingo scheduled to appear
twice and Gwyneth Jones making what could be her last appearances at the
Garden. With a frozen Arts Council grant, and box office below target,
Isaacs is tempted to replace this expensive opera with another revival,
Tosca. This is what cuts in arts funding mean - not wholesale closures but
candle-end economies.
It also means taking fewer risks. Another hard pressed opera company, Welsh
National Opera, is also dropping a planned production, Smetana's The Two
Widows, which opened recently to mixed reviews at the London Coliseum. It
would look much better on the WNO's small Cardiff stage but it cannot afford
to take chances at the box office.
Finally the Barbican has rationalised away 15 jobs from the 172 employed in
the City of London's arts centre. Here again falling revenues has been the
driving force behind greater efficiency.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Acrostic competition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shakespearian sonnets and Spenserian stanzas, free verse, carols, cantatas
and choruses, poems in French and in Italian were all inspired by our John
Major acrostic competition. There were literary ruminations on the state of
both the nation and the England cricket team - and, less predictably, on the
nature of John and Norma's love life.
Runner-up was Bernard McGinley of London with an extract from his lively
literary epic The Blokiad. There were two winners. William Hopkin, aged 8,
gave us haiku which began:
John Major,
On his nose
Has spectacles
Not freckles.
A book token, rather than a bottle of champagne, goes to William - if only
he would send us his address, which he omitted to include on his entry.
The alliterative acrostic of joint winner RE Hurst of Yorkshire was as much
fun to recite as it is to read:
Juggling, jinking, jollying, jetting
Owling, scowling, opting-outing
Hushing, halting, hamming, hailing,
Never nothing, nothing nailing . . .
A magnum of champagne is on its way.

<TEXT>
THE MAN IN THE ICE
by Konrad Spindler
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99 305 pages
To call this 'the archaeological event of the century' smacks of hyperbole.
The man who was hacked out of a glacier in the Tyrolean Alps in September
1991 may have been over 5,000 years old, but he was not a chieftain or a
demi-god. He bore no fine insignia, commanded no great armies, patronised no
bards and had no stores of gold. Nameless, illiterate, astray from his home,
he was found by chance; and he survives in spite of, not because of, the
clumsy effort to extract him from the ice. His promotion as the Tutankhamun
of the North seems thoroughly perverse.
Yet the Iceman commands our imagination in ways a pharaoh never could. No
doubt he led a wolfish and niggardly life, but his simple masteries of
Alpine subsistence will appeal to anyone with a flinty spark of the Boy
Scout in them. He carried a pannier on his back, whose frame was made of
hazel wands and larch wood. He wore an impervious belt pouch, with
fire-kindling devices inside.
Two containers, made of birch bark, were found near his body; his last meal
had been of dried ibex, perhaps from an animal he had earlier dispatched
with his bow. At the time of his death, he was carrying a slightly
unfinished yew bow-stave; and the contents of his deerhide quiver reveal
that he had some work to do on his arrows, too. A small flint dagger served
as his penknife, and he also had a copper-bladed axe, which the first
discoverers of the lceman took to be a quaint Victorian ice-pick. All these
items bespeak an enviable ingenuity, and the sort of survival skills which a
modern commando would hardly match.
Tenderly documented in this book, the lceman's clothes are particularly
instructive. He wore a knee-length cape of plaited grass, a snug bell-shaped
cap, and various layers and leggings of leather and fur: his leather bootees
were grass-upholstered too. But of course the insulation was not enough.
Trapped in bad weather at an altitude of over 3,000 metres, he lay down,
probably exhausted. In a short while he was frozen under a pelt of snow.
And that makes a second claim upon us. Pity rises easily for this
proto-Alpiniste. Just as, with the wretched people of Pompeii, one can
rebuild a melodrama from the figures caught in Vesuvian ash, so a mixture of
fantasy and detection yields a story for this wizened nonentity. The romance
concocted by Professor Spindler is that the Iceman was escaping a local
pogrom, in which his village had been destroyed. He may have escaped after a
struggle, for several of his ribs were recently broken before his death; at
thirtysomething, he may have lost all that he loved (including his best
bow). Perhaps a Neolithic Titus Oates, the poignant loneliness of his end is
only tempered by the consolation of his archaeological utility.
Fully-dressed and equipped Europeans of 3000 BC have never been preserved
like this before: for proper burial normally ensures their organic
reintegration with the world. The Iceman's loss of rights, then, is a
scientific gain.
In this book, and elsewhere, the lceman has achieved a type of saintliness.
It is born of his portable herbal nostrums, his epic little journeyings, his
wisely-made accoutrements: all of which say more about modern yearnings for
the state of noble savagery, not our passion for Neolithic knowledge. But
there may be one predominant subliminal motive for canonising the Iceman.
According to a Swedish system of determining kinship amongst populations, a
man who lived over 5,000 years ago has a certain ratio of generational
contact extended over the centuries. In short, as Professor Spindler puts
it, the Iceman 'must be distantly related to us all.'

A HISTORY OF SIN
by Oliver Thomson
Canongate Press Pounds 17.99, 278 pages
Years ago John Sparrow, then Warden of All Souls and not noted for his
Christian piety, was seen to take the chaplain of Winchester College by the
elbow after attending Morning Chapel. 'That was a most interesting hymn we
sang just now. 'New sins forgiven'. Do drop me a card with the latest list.'
Social rules are as old as human culture and the breaking of them just as
old. They are constantly evolving and diverging, even to the point that
different cultures or successive generations may hold rules which are
contradictory. Oliver Thomson has attempted to map the vast range and
variety of these social norms, especially the nasty ones.
History of Sin falls into two main sections with a brief epilogue, in which
he tries to peer in to the future. The first section is designated 'The
Nature of Moralities'; the second is an extended canter through human
civilisation from 1,500,000 years BC to 1992 AD.
In the process Mr Thomson demonstrates a breadth of reading which is
mind-boggling. There are over 400 books listed in the Bibliography, and a
note that the list does not include the Holy Books of the great religions.
The author's canvas is global, would-be cosmic. One has a feeling that he
would love to be able to list some strange barbaric customs culled from the
Third Planet of Alpha Centauri. A hitchhiker's guide to the ethical systems
of the Galaxy must surely be his next endeavour.
The enterprise is of course potentially fascinating; a comparative
anthropology of the development of morals pursued with intellectual rigour
and with a sustained thesis is likely to be enlightening. But the sheer mass
of material and the multitude of generalisations drawn from the exhaustive
collage of instances he has collected make it difficult to find here any
coherent analysis. Mr Thomson is more concerned about public policy than
with personal morality.
Reading between the lines one may sense a deeply compassionate man
struggling with the perennial beastliness of human beings who have so
persistently quenched the small flames of compassion, cooperation and
altruism under a tide of cruelty and institutional violence and then
compounded the felony by commending barbaric customs as virtues.
Accumulating multitudes of instances does add colour; the virtues, but more
the vices, of other peoples and ages have undoubted fascination.
Open the book on any page and the eye will be caught by an intriguing
instance or illustration. (Nothing prurient.) Did you know that Timur the
Lame built a tower of 70,000 skulls? That in Bombay it was at one time a
capital offence to paint a moustache on a sleeping woman? That the Amish
people forbade buttons? Do you know about cannibalism, pederasty, human
sacrifice or ritual prostitution from the Andes to Tibet? About
anitsemitism, racism, the Inquisition? About flagellation or fanatical
puritanism? Here it is docketed and dated. But the endless listing and
enumerating of instances eventually reduces history to natural history - row
after row of butterflies pinned on a board.
Too much detail is not the only problem. There are significant but undefined
distinctions between ethics, morals, cultural norms and social taboos.
Fashions in shoes are different from issues of justice and mercy. The
language context of sin is normally religious; it is an offence against the
Divine. 'Immorality' has a different language context, so does 'ethical'.
There is not enough account of the progress of moral philosophy without
which ethical analysis is impossible. The result is the relativisation of
all moral judgment which leads in turn to the inevitable frustration of any
attempt to write a history of sin except as an immense collection of learned
vignettes with commentary.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Books: Thrilled to bits by new trends - JDF Jones finds
today's private eyes have nothing whatsoever in common with Miss Marple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
Not all of us read Tolstoy every night of the week. Some of us need to take
a break. My colleague William Weaver, for example, when he relaxes from his
work translating fiendishly high-brow Italian novels, reads a crime story or
two after supper.
This is the area where the thriller - when it is not an ambitious foray into
the art of fiction, as with Greene or Le Carre - has its principal, useful
and decent function: to entertain. Usually there is little for reviewers to
say about a new thriller because of most of the writers, including some of
the most successful, work to a formula. When the new Gerald Seymour (The
Fighting Man, HarperCollins Pounds 14.99) or Colin Forbes (The Power, Pan
Pounds 14.99) appears in the bookshops the reader knows what to expect and
critical comment is usually superfluous. But the genre has another
fascination - the search for the unusual, the off-beat, the fresh talent, a
new trend.
Some of the best fun I have had this winter has come from Susan Wittig
Albert, who has produced a genuinely new version of the American woman
private eye, a breed which no longer seems as startling as she did when Sara
Paretsky created VI Warshawski, when Liza Cody gave us Anna Lee, and before
everyone else piled in with formidable heroines who have nothing whatsoever
in common with Miss Marple.
Ms Albert's first novel, Thyme Of Death (Pounds 7.99, 260 pages, in
paperback-original) is published in the imaginative Mask Noir list of
Serpent's Tail. Her heroine is China Bayles, a feisty feminist lawyer light
years distant from the mean Chicago streets of Paretsky, who has thrown up
her profession to open a herb shop in Pecan Springs, deep in the heart of
Texas.
China has her shop and her ex-cop boyfriend and her New Age neighbour and a
relish for the simple charms of smalltown daily life. Then the murders
start, the TV personality arrives in town, the lesbian intrigues multiply,
the boyfriend wants a wife, not an independent woman friend. It is splendid
entertainment and certainly makes a change after Anna Karenina. The only
weaknesses are that the villain is inadequately developed and we (men) are
told more than we want to know about cooking and clothes, but such blemishes
can be forgiven - after all, we try to forget that VI Warshawski's second
name is Iphigenia.
*
Another oddball discovery this season is Alan Davidson's Something Quite Big
(Prospect Books Pounds 9.99, 286 pages). Davidson is the fish man - the
British ex-ambassador who has written prize-winning books about fish and the
cooking of them - and it is now revealed that, 20 years ago when he was a
diplomat at NATO, he wrote what his publisher correctly describes as 'a
romantic thriller'. The idiots at the Foreign Office forbade its
publication, and no doubt vetoed his 'K' when he had it printed privately.
At last it is available, and turns out to be an absolute delight,
amateurish, non-violent, erudite, sentimental, and utterly unlike any other
thriller that will be published this year. The plot has to do with the
kidnapping of an entire Senior Political Committee of NATO diplomats by a
gang of (before their time) environmentalists. It is very much an insider's
joke about the profession of diplomacy (the abducted officials happily
settle down to an exercise in drafting a communique) but the joke is
accessible and the result can only be described as charming. It does not
matter that the dialogue also reads like a communique. Perhaps it should be
reviewed by our Diplomatic Correspondent.
*
Once upon a time Michael Dobbs, Mrs Thatcher's youthful aide, was also an
amateur and apprentice thriller writer. That was how he created the villain
of the decade, Francis Urquhart, in House of Cards (much helped by Ian
Richardson's TV performances). Now Dobbs has become the professional, but he
will need more than Richardson to rescue his latest, The Touch Of Innocents
(HarperCollins Pounds 9.99, 271 pages).
Again we are offered an allegedly insider-view. There is a dastardly and
charismatic Defence Secretary ('A man, like a good malt, improving with age.
And moist, pale blue eyes': who he?); a star woman television journalist; a
contract for the Duster joint-venture fighter aircraft; a politician's
daughter on drugs . . . But it is a curiously incoherent, ill-paced tale,
not helped by an evident obligation to appeal to the American market: it
turns out to be 'about' a woman's independence, motherhood, custody, which
is all very fine except that this has to be inserted into the routine
formulas of the 'political thriller'. Our Political Editor has sent it back
to me.
*
Once upon a time Peter Driscoll wrote a good thriller, The Wilby Conspiracy,
which was turned into an even better film with Nicol Williamson. His latest,
Spoils Of War (Bantam Pounds 15.99, 318 pages) is routine stuff set in Iraq
and Kuwait after the Gulf War and redeemed by the quality of the local
detail. There are various Arab villains, a breaking marriage, sympathy for
the Kurds, a rather pale hero. It deserves to be reviewed by our Middle East
Editor.
*
Tim Sebastian is one of the TV reporters who have cashed in on their fragile
fame to produce best-sellers purporting to tell the story behind the news.
Special Relations (Orion Pounds 14.99, 308 pages) is based on the corniest
idea of 1994, that the US President and the British prime minister (female)
had a grand affair 30 years ago in Oxford and have had no contact with each
other since then. Now they have to sort out a crisis about missile silos in
the Ukraine.
'(He) 'You feel just the same'. (She) 'There's more of me'. She turned
towards him and ran her hand down his stomach. 'And there's less of you'.
(He) 'That's not very flattering'. She giggled again. 'I didn't mean there.
I meant your waist . . .''
Who on earth can these people be? I must ask our Defence Correspondent.

RUDYARD KIPLING: SELECTED POEMS
edited by Peter Keating
Penguin Pounds 5.99, 229 pages
KIPLING THE POET
by Peter Keating
Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 25, 270 pages
'And a woman is only a woman; but a good cigar is a Smoke'. 'Take up the
White Man's Burden/ Send forth the best ye breed . . .'
It is difficult to think of another English poet - apart from Shakespeare -
who has had so many of his lines turned into popular sayings as Kipling's
were. The most memorable seem today to be the epitome of political
incorrectness. Even so Kipling sprawls across seven pages of the Oxford
Dictionary of Quotations while Donne, say, is contained in three and a half.
The last time Penguin gave us an edition of Kipling's poems - in 1977 at
Pounds 1.25 - it was called Rudyard Kipling: Selected Verse. In Peter
Keating's selection just published the word 'Verse' in the title has been
replaced by 'Poems', and in his critical book that appears at the same time
Keating argues forcefully that Kipling was a true poet, not just a writer of
verse.
Kipling himself always referred to his poetry as verse to distinguish it
from the outpourings of the fin-de-siecle poets who were his contemporaries.
When in 1941 TS Eliot began the work of bringing Kipling the poet in from
the cold by writing an essay on him, followed by a selection of his poems,
he called this A Choice of Kipling's Verse, thus perpetuating the second
division term. Kipling's posthumous respectability as a poet dates from
Eliot's selection even though Leavis and others vehemently demurred.
Eliot's selection was widely reviewed and prompted two additional important
reappraisals, by Orwell and by Auden. They declared themselves to be
admirers but revealed, as Eliot had done, just how difficult it is to define
Kipling's poetic merits in the light of a tradition that includes
Shakespeare, Donne and Yeats. Orwell came to the conclusion that Kipling was
a 'good bad poet'.
Auden felt that Kipling's poems '. . . have the air of brilliant tactical
improvisations to overcome sudden unforeseen obstacles . . .' He also
suggested that, despite their amazing variety of material, the poems present
a recurring situation, the danger of encirclement '. . . by inanimate
forces, the Picts beyond the Roman Wall, . . . the Danes, the Dutch, the
Huns, the 'new caught sullen peoples half devil and half child', even the
Female of the Species.'
Kipling's muse began to work overtime when he was a pupil at the United
Services College in Devon and for the rest of his life it never stopped. His
father published his juvenilia in Lahore in 1881 as Schoolboy Lyrics. Half a
century and hundreds of poems later, Kipling published 'Storm Cone' in the
Morning Post. In this poem he warned his countrymen of the threat posed by a
resurgent Nazified Germany. Four years later, in 1936, Kipling died.
'The present book' says Keating 'is not only a study of Kipling as a poet,
but also a life of Kipling as revealed in his poetry.' Because Kipling
responded as a poet so strongly to contemporary events it does help to know
the historical and biographical background. Here Keating, formerly an
English don at the University of Edinburgh, is at his most useful. His
explanations complement those given in 1973 by Charles Carrington in his
edition of The Complete Barrack-Room Ballads.
Keating, for example, further elucidates one of Kipling's most celebrated
poems 'The Absent-Minded Beggar'. It appeared first in the Daily Mail in
1899 at the height of the Boer War. Its intention - hugely successful - was
to raise money for serving men's wives and families. Hence the odd title:
the beggar's (ie the duffer's, ie the soldier's) 'absent-mindedness' about
his family's needs was a typically ironical touch:
'When you've shouted 'Rule Britannia,' when you've sung 'God Save the
Queen,'
When you've finished killing Kruger with your mouth,
Will you kindly drop a shilling in my little tambourine
For a gentleman in khaki ordered south?'
Keating points to the time when Kipling was living in Villiers Street, by
Charing Cross Station, almost next door to Gatti's, one of the Victorian
Music Halls, and shows how cunningly he adapted the catchy rollicking
rhythms of the popular Cockney songsters to his needs.
As a patriotic gesture Kipling waived his copyright in 'The Absent-Minded
Beggar' and the poem spread like wildfire. Sullivan set it to music, Lily
Langtry recited it on stage, it appeared on handkerchiefs, scarves, biscuit
barrels. There was even a backlash from the great Albert Chevalier who sang
a parody of it suggesting there were more deserving causes in the inner
cities. 'Through the roll of the drums hear the cry from the slums, and pay]
pay] pay]'
It clearly belongs with the Barrack-Room Ballads (first published in
book-form in 1892) though Kipling did not put it in a book of poems until
1914. It is through the Ballads that Kipling as a poet makes his greatest
appeal. Enjoyable to read to oneself they work even better in performance.
Keating comments on their use of Cockney dialect, their roots in the
dramatic monologue, the way succeeding collections reflected Kipling's
shifting points of focus, from land to sea, from common soldier to ship's
engineer (see that magnificent Calvinist ballad 'McAndrew's Hymn'), from
India to South Africa.
But Keating also shows how much more there was to Kipling as a poet than the
Ballads - verses celebrating his love of the Sussex countryside, imitations
of Horace, the terse epitaphs during the first world war (in which Kipling's
son was killed) in the manner of the Greek Anthology, elegies, protest and
didactic poems, poems about animals and nursery lyrics.
Keating succeeds in plotting the course of Kipling's life exclusively
through discussion of his poetry; but, as he says, a peculiar feature of
that poetry was how frequently poems were written as an accompaniment to
Kipling's stories. Whereas many writers of fiction head a chapter with a
quotation from a poem, Kipling often wrote whole poems to serve as
chapter-headings and end-pieces. Several of these poems then took on lives
of their own in revised or expanded form.
'If', Kipling's best-known poem, is a prime example of this process. It
first appeared as the closing poem to the story 'A Priest in Spite of
Himself' in Rewards and Fairies. Kipling said this poem was based on Dr L S
Jameson, leader of the Jameson Raid. Keating sheds a flood of light on many
poems by tracking them back to their places of origin. Both confirmed
Kiplingites and those taking Kipling up for one more try are likely to
benefit from Keating's work.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: Hard climb to the downhill - Winter Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cities that bid passionately for the Olympic Games tend towards an envious
belief that once the Good Fairy of the International Olympic Committee has
granted her benediction everything will be wonderful. Some of the winning
cities know different, however.
Lillehammer, for example. When Gerhard Heiberg, one of Norway's leading
industrialists, was drafted in to head the country's Winter Olympics project
one year after Lillehammer received the IOC's nod, he found chaos.
'There were no budgets, no schedule. People thought the government would pay
for everything,' recalled Heiberg, 54.
Three weeks before the Games open, on February 12, Heiberg sits in his
Lillehammer office a calm man. Every venue is completed, tested and
polished. Sponsors are in place and happy. Income is running ahead of budget
 -although Oslo will still pick up two-thirds of the total Pounds 650m cost
of the Olympiad.
'In Norway things have to happen in a calm, well-planned way or everyone
gets very nervous,' said Heiberg. He spends two days a week in Lillehammer,
on secondment from his full-time job as chairman of the Aker group.
'Last-minute changes are not at all the Nordic style.'
I commented on the contrast between Lillehammer and Barcelona 1992 - where
workmen were often still completing Olympic sites with an hour to go.
Heiberg shudders at the thought. 'Latins are much more flexible - for good
or bad,' he said. 'But I can tell you that we could start the Games tomorrow
if asked to.'
When a skier clutching the Olympic torch leaps off the Lysgardsbakkene ski
jump, visible from Lillehammer's main street, to begin the opening ceremony,
it is certain that the world will pay more attention than ever before to the
Games of snow and ice.
One reason is the shift of the Olympic calendar so that winter and summer
Games alternate every two years. Previously they occurred in the same year -
such as Albertville followed by Barcelona - making life difficult for
everyone from sponsors to TV broadcasters.
'It will enable the winter games to come into their own and grow, rather
than be the Little event before the Big event,' predicted Juan Antonio
Samaranch, IOC President. That has certainly been true internationally. What
has especially helped the 1994 Games achieve lift-off in Norway is the
country's success in Albertville two years earlier.
Its skiers and skaters achieved nine golds out of a total of 21 medals,
second overall to Germany. It was an extraordinary performance for a country
of only 4m people, where many disciplines such as Alpine skiing and
bob-sleighing are quite alien to a pragmatic sports culture of cross-country
skiing and skating.
'We were very fortunate that this happened just two years before
Lillehammer. It created a wave of enthusiasm,' added Heiberg. 'At a time of
rising unemployment and economic worries Norwegians wanted a cause to
believe in.'
His style was to lead from the front. When the downhill course opened at
Kvitfjell, 15km north of Lillehammer, Heiberg was the first person to make
the descent; the gradient touches 60 per cent in places. Top skiers such as
Alberto Tomba have said it is one of the toughest tracks in the world.
'I was scared like never before in my life - until they persuaded me to open
the bobsleigh track. To this day my legs still shake when I think about the
bobsleigh. Nothing could make me do it again,' said Heiberg, who claims his
managerial style is to delegate everything.
Media moguls and IOC dignitaries alike will find themselves housed in a
simple Nordic style that is far from their custom. Lillehammer is a tiny
town (20,000 people) that aims to remain somewhere James Stewart could
retire to.
'Some of the Olympic committee members coming here won't be happy,' said
Heiberg, who knows full well that the IOC members have a built-in default to
first-class. 'We don't have any five-star hotels here and we're not
interested in building any.
'This is a beautiful agricultural part of the country with long traditions.
Why should we build something looking like Japan or America? I told Mr
Samaranch four years ago that we are going to do these Games the Norwegian
way.'
