FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: Winter greens - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
You know those calendars which show tiny greens perched precariously on
clifftops, with minuscule tees 100ft below? l have news. Places like this
really exist. I have recently played in one of the world's most unusual golf
tournaments. It took place - as it does every year - in mid-winter, on the
island of Arran, off the west coast of Scotland.
The Arran Challenge is held at Shiskine Golf Club, near the tiny fishing
village of Blackwaterfoot. It is a curious tournament. It lasts 10 days,
although most 'foreign' competitors (anyone from the mainland) do not stay
that long. You are required to play 36 holes although you can play as many
practice rounds as you choose.
To describe the conditions while I was there as cold, wet and windy would be
to fall a full-wedge short of accuracy. Most people would not have put a
disobedient dog out in them. Players sat in the bar of the only hotel
drinking Scotch broth and Scottish beer until they felt brave enough to go
outside.
The course has only 12 holes. This is a much more convenient number than 18,
since you can get around in a 1 1/2 hours. The locals claim it is the only
12-hole course in the world (although I have it on good authority that
others exist in Ireland and Australia).
The course is short, (six of the 12 holes are par-threes and only one is par
five) but in spite of this, and in spite of the fact that several
international golfers have played it, par was not broken for more than 40
years.
'We've had some Walker Cup players here,' says John McLean, the tournament
organiser (who will tell you without the hint of a smile that the course is
as good as Augusta or Pebble Beach). 'For some strange reason though, they
never seem to score very well here. l think they underestimate it.' The
course was designed over the years by three Open champions, Willie Fernie,
Willie Park and James Braid. Two attempts have been made to extend it to 18
holes, but world wars intervened on both occasions.
'The challenge starts well before you tee it up on the first,' McLean said.
'It doesn't finish when you sink your last putt either. Just getting to and
from Arran at this time of year can be a test in itself.'
To reach Blackwaterfoot, you must make your way to the depressed Ayrshire
town of Ardrossan, board a ferry for the 70-minute crossing to Brodick, then
journey 10 miles across mountains.
The course is eccentric. At the third hole you play to a slim post high in
the sky some 130 yards away. The right club for distance is somewhere
between a driver and a nine-iron, depending on the wind. The right
instrument for elevation is anything from a catapult to a rocket launcher.
There are reasonably handicapped golfers still trying to hit a wedge as high
as you need to hit one here. The third is by no means an exception.
This is old-fashioned golf at its most capricious. There are blind shots
galore (three on the first three holes) and marker-posts everywhere. At the
second, a par-four of 375 yards, there is a blind second shot. Fair enough.
What some would argue is not quite so fair is the Swilcan-type burn which
hides like a trip-wire at the front of the green.
As far as l know there were no Walker Cup players this year, just a bunch of
rough and ready hackers willing to pit themselves against the sheep and the
elements. Legend has it that Americans and Australians have travelled over
for the event, but l saw no evidence of them either.
I did not win the Arran Challenge. It was won by a local. No surprise there,
locals have won for the last three years. Because the competition lasts 10
days, they have the advantage of being able to wait for a gap in the wind
and rain before darting out to play their rounds. Some of us had to catch
the ferry. We feared that the weather would set in, the ferry would not sail
and we would be stuck on the island.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: Racing 4,000 miles to a photo-finish - The third leg
of the Whitbread race ends today. It will be close / Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the past three days the Tasman Sea has been almost a psychiatric ward
for sailors. The Whitbread fleet has been converging on Auckland for
probably the tightest finish of a single leg in the history of the race.
Competitors have been just a few miles from rival yachts, desperately trying
another sail combination or a better downwind angle in the hunt for another
ounce of speed.
Kiwi nationalism is adding to the competitive spirit. Four of the leading
half-dozen boats have either New Zealand crews or skippers. What the All
Blacks are (or were) to rugby, so the NZ sailor is to professional yachting.
Ross Field, in charge of the W60 class Yamaha, is a typical example. With 24
hours of racing left, Field was in third place just 11 miles behind fellow
New Zealander Chris Dickson at the helm of Tokio. Both yachts are funded by
Japanese sponsors.
'Tension is rising and we know we've got a boat race on our hands. I get
terrified every six hours just before we get a new position update on the
computer,' said Field over the Inmarsat link. Having been pre-race favourite
in the W60 class, Yamaha has had a disappointing race so far but first place
into Auckland's spectacular Waitemata Harbour would compensate for a great
deal.
'We are carefully planning the slightest move on deck. Everyone aboard is
aware that we can't afford the slightest mistake in either the way we sail
the boat or the tactics.'
British skipper Lawrie Smith, at the wheel of the pan-European W60 entry
Intrum Justitia, is one of Field's tormentors. Several times the satellite
race results system has shown them in joint first place with an exactly
equal distance remaining to Auckland.
Since joining Intrum just a few days before the start to leg two, Smith has
shown himself capable of finding extra speed in the radical and still
somewhat unexplored W60 class. Just pointing the boat at the finish and
trimming the main is no longer enough.
'A top helmsman can get another knot out of these W60s in comparison with a
journeyman. They are that sensitive,' he said. 'Working the sails a bit you
get another. Get the exact right sail up and you'll get another.
'Suddenly you're doing 17 knots rather than 14 and in a six hour period
you've taken a big chunk out of the guys you're chasing.'
This analysis certainly held good in the first few days at sea after leaving
Fremantle. In that period Winston, skippered by the America's Cup legend
Dennis Conner with six New Zealanders among the crew including co-skipper
Brad Butterworth, made a brave and successful break.
This time last week Winston was 150 miles ahead of the nearest pursuer. The
lead had been gained by diving south in the first days out of Fremantle.
Conner's gamble paid off when his crew found stronger breezes on the bottom
edge of the Roaring Forties.
However, Smith has justified his reputation as one of the most calculating
minds in yacht racing. Choosing his own course and consistently moving a
knot or so faster than the opposition by sailing better angles, he reeled in
Conner and then passed him. Yesterday, Winston lay second, five miles behind
Tokio.
Chris Dickson, driving Tokio with the single-minded determination which is
his trademark, played much the same game as Intrum. However, in spite of
Dickson's undoubted brilliance he may be too much of a one-man band on
board. In the endgame of earlier legs he has helmed for up to 30 hours
non-stop, but the knife-edge approach to Auckland has simply taken too long
for that to be possible.
And in the middle of this knife-fight is the maxi-ketch New Zealand
Endeavour. Although racing in a different class to the fleet W60s, skipper
Grant Dalton has the most overpowering of reasons to want to lead the
Whitbread armada into Auckland.
In the 1989 / 90 Whitbread he was in charge of Fisher &amp; Peykel, the ketch
that was narrowly beaten on every leg by Steinlager II. Dalton looked likely
to be first into Auckland as the two yachts approached the outer reaches of
Waitemata Harbour with F&amp;P fractionally ahead. Off Bream Head a sudden
squall knocked both boats flat. Steinlager II recovered quicker and crossed
the line six minutes ahead.
Dalton's chagrin was agony to behold. This time he has had to endure the
W60s overtaking NZ Endeavour as the breeze freshened, then regaining the
overall lead as the weather went light once more.
'Morale had started to sag a little when the wind didn't moderate. Watching
the 60s scream past doing two to three knots more than us was not a pretty
sight,' said Dalton. 'Now if the weather stays light we've got every chance
of being first in.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: An uncertain start - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great appeal of sport is its uncertainty. When Steffi Graf is two
service breaks down in the third set against Jana Novotna in the Wimbledon
final, you wonder, can she escape? When England are three points ahead of
New Zealand at Twickenham with five minutes to go you ask, can they hold
out? When Australia have lost nine wickets against England at Lords and need
10 runs in the last two overs for victory, you agonise, will they survive?
The uncertainty principle was at work this week in Melbourne. I do not
remember as exciting an opening to a Grand Slam Championship as we have had
during the first three days of the Ford Australian Open. On three successive
days in the first round the three top ranked men in the world were all in
serious danger of losing. Two survived, but only just. The third was beaten.
There was no clue on day one that the two-time defending champion, Jim
Courier, seeded three, would have any trouble from fellow American, Bryan
Shelton, the first black player to win a tournament since Arthur Ashe. True,
they had never played before but, with a world ranking down from a high of
55 in 1992 to 99, the 28-year-old Shelton was hardly expected to offer more
than token resistance to the toughest match player in the business.
Enter the uncertainty principle. Courier was not quite ready for a full
frontal assault from a serve-and-volley terrier who had decided to risk all
on big shots, even if it meant conceding points on extravagant errors. It
almost worked. From the first ball Shelton chipped and charged, lunged and
leapt with an enthusiasm that was infectious. Even before he broke the
champion in the ninth game Shelton had won over his Aussie audience. They
like a scrapper, and they showed it as Shelton won the set 6-4. 'I was
thoroughly enjoying the experience and I think they saw that in my face,' he
said later.
Courier regrouped in the second set and swept through it in 43 minutes. This
was more like it] A break in the opening game of the third set should have
cracked Shelton's spirit. Not a bit of it] He broke back at once, survived
four break points on his own serve in the ninth game and then raced to 6-1
in the tie-break. Courier clawed back to 4-6 but was powerless as Shelton
pounced on a short ball to ram a forehand volley fast and true across the
advancing Courier.
Order was restored in the fourth set as Courier brought himself level.
No-one was ready for what followed. Courier was broken in the opening game
of the fifth. Shelton raced to 3-1 and then had the champion 0-40 on his
serve. An upset was about to happen.
Enter the uncertainty principle. In spite of a 14th double fault, Courier
wriggled free and held his serve. Shelton was broken in the next game as he
delivered a 19th double fault. The momentum had swung to Courier and he
broke again in the last game for a 4-6 6-1 6-7 6-2 6-4 victory that had
spanned four hours and 42 thrilling minutes. 'At 3-1 I was already preparing
my acceptance speech,' said the loser. 'But Jim played well and I've got to
hand it to him - when the chips were down he played some great shots.'
On day two it was the turn of another black American to step into the
spotlight. MaliVai Washington, a 24-year-old right-hander, ranked 26th in
the world, had lost all four of his matches against Michael Stich. Their
latest meeting, at last December's Grand Slam Cup had been a simple 6-3 6-1
affair. But in Melbourne in 1992 Washington had led by two sets to love.
No one, least of all Washington, was quite prepared for Stich's poor form.
The hero of Germany's recent Davis Cup success and the winner of last year's
ATP Tour Championship should have been brimful of confidence. But his
normally reliable backhand simply refused to function and his serve was not
the lethal weapon it has been. Washington had something to spare in his 7-6
6-3 3-6 6-2 victory.
'It's the best win I've had in a long time and it's nice to beat the number
two guy in the world,' he said. Stich had no excuses: 'He hung in there and
didn't make as many unforced errors as I made. I just played a terrible
match.'
On Wednesday when an unheralded Russian, 19-year-old Yevgeny Kafelnikov from
the Black Sea town of Sochi, pushed the world No 1 Pete Sampras to the
limit. After dividing the first four sets they produced some dazzling tennis
in a fifth. Tall and slight, the fair-haired Kafelnikov returned the Sampras
serve with impudent assurance. A 3-1 American lead was wiped out with some
glorious driving that had Sampras shaking his head in disbelief. 'He has
some of the best groundies I've ever played against,' said Sampras. 'He's
going to be in the top 20, if not better, in the next couple of years.'
With Kafelnikov leading 5-4, Sampras was just two points from defeat on his
service. The reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion refused to panic and
won the next two points. The 6-5 lead to Kafelnikov became 6-6 with another
solid American service game. After a long struggle Sampras broke for 7-6.
This, surely was the end.
With remarkable coolness the youngster hit three stunning returns. Now it
was 7-7. How would it end? The question was answered in the next game when
Kafelnikov tried to stretch his cramping left leg. He could no longer find
the service power that had embarrassed Sampras. The Russian lost his serve
and was powerless against two huge Sampras aces as the American held serve
for victory. 'It was a big scare for me . . . I could easily have lost that
match,' he said.
This inspiring match had lasted three hours, 25 minutes with the result in
doubt until the last. Long live uncertainty]

FT  22 JAN 94 / Property: In search of a country living - Do you want a
rural lifestyle? Gerald Cadogan looks at barns and farm buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmer Richard Carlton looked at his barn. 'There was only a horse in here
six months ago,' he said. Now at Lower Farm, in the village of Bucknell,
near Bicester, Oxfordshire, half the barn holds the offices of NMA
Marketing, a property marketing consultant company.
The other - soundproofed - half is home to the newly-formed Glass Gramophone
Company which remasters golden-oldie hits from scratchy 78rpm records to
make compact discs. Across the yard, Carlton is converting another barn and
he has one more to tackle.
Carlton's barns are nothing special in themselves - many barns are listed
buildings, but not Carlton's. They were too small to house modern farm
machines and were not really needed for the farm: the barn with the horse
had been built as a milking parlour in the 1920s - but Carlton does not keep
cows. So he sought an alternative use for them.
He obtained outline planning permission to convert one of the barns into a
house but as it was the closest to his own farmhouse, he was not eager to
sell it. Holiday lets were not as good an option in north-east Oxfordshire
as they might have been in the Cotswolds to the west. Nevertheless, he may
eventually convert other buildings for holiday use.
His choice was to create industrial units for letting. Although deep in the
countryside, Bucknell is just three miles from junction 10 on the M40 (where
a service station opens shortly). And Cherwell district council liked the
idea of units. It felt they would bring business to an area badly hit by the
departure of the US Air Force from Upper Heyford, and would avoid adding to
the stock of local rented dwellings. And, as the barns and farm are in the
village area, they would not distort the traditional pattern of
self-contained villages separated by fields that planners try to maintain.
When the scheme started NMA arranged the let through James Offen, Carlton's
agent, and had the office fitted to its own specifications. NMA moved in
just before Christmas. The staff enjoy the new freedom of a roomy office
with high ceilings and windows that look out over fields.
Next door, Glass Gramophone asked for plenty of soundproofing in the walls
of its recording studio. Nothing must disturb its work of cleaning the sound
by removing the hiss, crackle and pop on discs by artists such as George
Formby and Duke Ellington.
Carlton is pleased with the result although he admits it is strange having
neighbours on the farm for the first time in many years.
Barns are, of course, commercial buildings. They were never intended to be
homes and often do not convert well. For example, how do you put windows
into long, blank walls designed to keep the elements away from the produce
stored inside? How do you introduce an upper floor? Or cope with big barn
doors, that open into what is, in effect, a great hall? In the 1980s, when
buyers snapped up every manor, farmhouse and rectory in the country, barns
were an easy substitute. Old and substantial, and as rooted in country life
as seed-time and harvest, they offered instant heritage. But there have been
plenty of bad conversions.
Besides offices, barns make fine workshops, theatres, concert halls, dance
halls (real barn dance nights are back), restaurants and tearooms. All these
uses can keep the excitement of the building's space and height, which is
difficult in a barn made into a three or four-bedroom and two-bathroom
house. But one objection planners may have to commercial use is a lack
sufficient parking space.
Isolated barns are especially difficult. Some district councils will not
allow conversions where the properties are in the middle of fields. So
should they be left to become roofless ruins? Or be dismembered for their
stone and slates? The unsentimental answer may be yes, either course may be
appropriate. If a barn does not have a cottage attached, planners see no
justification for a green-field single development breaking the habitation
pattern.
Costs are also a factor: an isolated barn might need a long, solid drive and
utilities are expensive to install over long distances. Councils also fear
the barn-house might be the thin end of the wedge: applications for a tennis
court or a swimming pool may follow.
Not all councils are so purist about isolated barns if new plans retain a
building's character. English Heritage might become involved if the building
is listed and in principle the organisation prefers commercial or community
use to residential.
Whatever the use, buyers should check with local councils on what is
allowed, and whether residential planning permission could change to
commercial or vice versa. Sellers will almost certainly have obtained
outline permission before putting the barn on the market.
Besides the units at Bucknell, three studio workshops in old farm buildings
at Tresprison near Helston in Cornwall are available to rent from Philpott
Homes.
Yorkshire Water is selling several barns and old farm buildings (some
isolated) in the glorious country of the Washburn valley near Harrogate, in
Yorkshire, through joint agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe and Dacre Son &amp; Hartley.
Prices start at Pounds 75,000. They need work but could be a good buy for
tele-workers who require only a fax and a modem, and would like to arrange
the conversion themselves.
Lane Fox offers a listed barn for Pounds 42,500 in the village of Moreton
Pinkney, built in the typical Northamptonshire style of alternating courses
of light and dark stone. A timber tithe barn, at Etchinghill, near
Folkestone, Kent, comes to auction on January 28 in Maidstone. Auctioneer
Clive Emson expects it to sell for about Pounds 65,000-Pounds 75,000. At
West Marden, in the South Downs, Sussex, on the border with Hampshire, a
brick and flint barn is available for Pounds 78,000 from Jackson-Stops. Its
strict planning permission runs out in December.
Converted barns on offer include a timber barn at Pakenham, near Bury St
Edmunds, Suffolk (Bedford, Pounds 175,000), and a group of farm buildings at
Church Farm, near Castle Cary, Somerset (Jackson-Stops, Yeovil, from Pounds
140,000).

FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Up to the waist in snow - Michael Woods samples the
various means of transport in arctic Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SILK-soft nostrils of Svartir, the impatient Icelandic pony towing the
sledge behind, puffed hot, steamy breaths over us. Svartir was in a good
mood though often she is a sluggard, falling farther behind on the half-hour
journey along the frozen road leading deep into the Finnmark countryside.
Tonight she was with us all the way as the sledges hissed and the ponies
clip-clopped and jingled in the semi-darkness across the snow. Our
destination was Ongajoksetra, near Alta in the area of arctic Norway known
as Finnmark where, in Turid Kjellmann's kitchen, we drank a warming mixture
of red wine, cherry juice and cinnamon called glogg before starting our
meal.
Even with Svartir's impatience, travelling by horse-drawn sleigh turned out
to be a good deal calmer than dog-sledding the following day when we
travelled from Alta on to the empty Finnmark plateau.
The huskies arrived at our starting point in blocks of individual kennels
bolted to the back of a pick-up truck; they were so anxious to be off that
they almost burst through the doors. Once out and attached to the single
trace, they yowled and barked with enthusiasm and strained to be away.
As a precaution, the trace had been attached by a slip knot to the tow bar
of the truck and, with all 16 dogs in place, even that began to slither
slowly over the snow. Finally the driver of the dog team slipped the knot
and our sledge shot off at high speed.
The local policeman was to have been one of our sledge drivers but he was
unable to be with us. Instead he had to go in search of a missing woman. She
had set out on cross-country skis late the previous afternoon to visit
friends but had not arrived. What seemed to us a foolhardy expedition was
apparently an everyday journey for the Norwegians, who learn to ski at about
the time they learn to walk.
As I discovered for myself when I tried to go for a walk without the benefit
of skis, the thick blanket of snow which cloaks the landscape is almost as
confining as water, and I found myself floundering waist-deep in the stuff.
The only way forward was to follow snow-mobile tracks. The snowy wastes were
deserted. Tracks told where fox and mountain hare had woven a complex story
in the night. Like an omen in the emptiness a raven flew overhead, croaking
like an old donkey.
We stopped our dogs to drink coffee, boiling the water on a fire built on
top of birch twigs in a hole dug in the snow. We sat round the rim on
reindeer hides, chewing dried venison and drinking our hot brew in the
silence as the fire grew hotter and sank deeper and deeper into its pit.
Even the dogs were quiet, anchored and strung out along the trace like
dog-shaped washing in black and white. The silence was soon to be shattered,
though, for just around the hill were the snow-mobiles on which we were to
continue our journey; the odour of dogs was replaced by the smell of
exhaust.
The snow-mobile is the arctic equivalent of the Harley Davidson and brings
out a lust for speed in the most staid. We set off down a designated track
to Jotka mountain lodge for lunch. The Alta area is noted for its trees. It
is not that they are special, just that there is nothing else this far
north.
Alta catches the last vestiges of warmth from the Gulf Stream, just enough
to allow birches to raise their heads tentatively above ground level. They
punctuate an otherwise featureless landscape plateau with shades and tones.
Threaded through the trees, our route was marked by staves, a necessary
precaution because even in spring it is possible for several inches of snow
in a single night to obliterate the track.
These staves are also important because of the need to restrict
snow-mobiles. The advent of such fast, all-terrain vehicles has changed the
face of the north and the lives of the reindeer-herding Lapps, now more
properly called Sami.
The Sami no longer need to camp out with their deer, moving with the herds
as they search for food. Instead they live in nearby towns, racing out each
day to seek the deer on their snow-mobikes.
The resultant erosion, together with high levels of over-stocking to pay for
such expensive machines, has destroyed areas of reindeer moss, the lichen
staple of the deer in winter. Herds are being reduced sharply in order to
control matters, while the snow-mobiles are required to stick to certain
trails.
Judging by the exhibition of lassoeing which we watched, that tradition,
too, is on the decline. Two Sami tried to ensnare the reindeer antlers but
they seemed unskilled; it was no surprise to find that they prefer to bribe
their reindeer, gathering them around a bag of concentrated food rather than
chasing them with lassoes.
Up to their knees in snow, the reindeer looked even smaller than I had
expected as they scraped away snow with insulated, fur-covered noses to
reach the moss beneath. We had come to see these deer with their owner,
Kirsten Bent Gaup, one of the few Sami still to own a herd. The male deer
were bare-headed for they lose their antlers after the autumn rut; they are
thus disadvantaged during the winter when the calf-carrying females, which
retain their antlers, need food more urgently. As they crowded around
Kirsten, it was the cows that prodded their way to the best of the food she
was dispensing.
In spite of the harsh climate and the months of winter darkness, the people
of the north and their reindeer are great survivors. The woman, lost
overnight, turned up safely if a little late, perhaps confirming the Samis'
notorious disregard for punctuality and lack of urgency. 'If you are in such
a hurry,' their saying goes, 'why didn't you arrive yesterday.' Perhaps
Svartir was trying to do just that.
Michael Woods flew to Norway with SAS and travelled with Norwegian State
Railways (London tel: 071-930-6666) which runs tailor-made arctic Norway
holidays from Pounds 1,000 for five days. These include horse and dog
sledging, snow-mobiling and visiting Sami reindeer and their herders. A
padded suit is provided along with boots, gloves and hat for a small extra
sum.
Specialist clothing is also available in Britain from Mountain Equipment
(customer service department: 061-366-5020) and Helly Hansen (0234-266966).

FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Mugged by the magic of Rye - Nigel Andrews admits to
an addiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry James called it the 'ceremony known as afternoon tea' (first sentence,
The Portrait of a Lady). Many believe it was the main reason he settled in
England. We can picture the great man, his vast egg-like face surveying the
British landscape until he espies - ah] Rye] For here, on a hillock
overlooking what was once the sea, stood and still stands the most beautiful
town in south-east England and the perfect place for the pluperfect repast.
Cobbled streets clamber past half-timbered tea rooms. The hiss of kettles
swells like a siren at 3.45pm. And when you have been stung for the price of
a cuppa in Elizabethan surroundings, you can move happily off to be stung by
the antique shops all around.
I am a Rye addict and probably incurable; a regular visitor ever since
studying HJ at university. Scholastic zeal took me to the Georgian corner
house where the master dictated his late novels and entertained the
illustrious: Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, Rudyard Kipling and Co. Lamb
House is a must. Its frozen, limpid dignity tells us much about Henry James,
good and bad, and the garden is a delight on a summer's day.
But if I came for James I stayed - or kept returning - for Rye itself. Here
is that rarity, a town that lives in the present while still seeming to
breathe with the lungs of the past - a town so unscarred that it needs no
gussying up by its tourist board.
In fact, the 'Rye Tourist Initiative' has been going to the other extreme
lately and risking infamy by official vandalism. The body in question is
thinking of removing the famous cobblestones - I ask you - from Rye's
thoroughfares, including Mermaid Street, its masterpiece of the
cobbly-picturesque.
This uphill river of stones surges past historical-architectural gems before
washing up against the fabled, fabulous Mermaid Inn: a brick-and-timber
former smugglers' hostelry that creaks and tilts and winks and boasts a
prize main bedroom called Dr Syn's Bedchamber (named after Romney Marshes'
top smuggler), last notably slept in by the Queen Mother.
Rye's greatness lies in its having survived time and trouble and tourism
initiatives for nigh on 1,000 years. Back in the 16th century it was the
foremost town in Sussex; 400 years before that it was eminent enough to
become, with neighbouring Winchelsea, one of the two prestigious Ancient
Towns attached to the Cinque Ports.
Now lapped by flatlands, Rye was lapped centuries ago by the English
Channel. In Tudor times 400 ships lay at ease in her waters and Queen
Elizabeth I stopped by to dub the place 'Rye Royal'.
Old pictures and prints show the same beautiful, huddled-housed,
church-crowned promontory. You must make sure, if you have only a day, to
see the following landmarks:
Land Gate and Hilder's Cliff. After threading the 14th century archway, you
climb a rising street that overlooks marshland, fishing craft and, far off,
the oddly magical bulk (on the right day) of Dungeness power station.
The Old Grammar School. A 'masterpiece of brickish aplomb', as one guidebook
says. A wine-red 17th century building in the Kew Gardens Dutch style, it
towers over High Street, unhumbled even by its present status as a discount
shop.
Ypres Tower. 700 years old and looking every minute of it, this
mini-fortress and one-time prison was built by Henry III. For the first half
of this century it was a mortuary; now it is a museum.
St Mary's Church. Reformation and pre-Reformation styles mix in the building
that crowns Rye's hill.
What else should you do before sunset and dinner at, I suggest, the
succulent Landgate Bistro? Probably dash to the town hall to check out its
handsome facade and weird cache of memorabilia, including a gibbet-cage and
a pillory; eyeball two picturesquely jettied buildings, the Flushing Inn and
Fletcher's House; and wander up and down, down and up, the High Street.
I have taken friends to Rye. I have astonished them with the cobbled streets
(who will dare to remove them?), refreshed them in quaintly gnarled
tea-rooms, expounded the town's history, and generally tried to mug them
with its magic. It always works. Rye is not so much a place out of time,
more a place where different times are conjurable and vivid every time you
turn a corner.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Quiet times for Egypt's King Tut tat sellers - The
best time to see Egypt's temples may have been now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hearing where we spent the new year, people look at us with the kind of
respect due to someone who has come back from Bosnia. 'You went to Egypt]
Wasn't that dangerous?' We demur. Ten days in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan were
fascinating and unforgettable. Yes, we would go back like a shot.
Not that this is the happiest phrase, given the prevalent view of Egypt as a
country in the grip of bearded fanatics who shoot anyone in a swimsuit. It
has been a disastrous period for tourism, Egypt's second most important
currency earner. On December 27, while we were there, the most serious
attack on tourists to date took place when Moslem extremists bombed and
fired on a coach carrying Austrians in old Cairo.
Meanwhile, we were at Aswan, congratulating ourselves on our prescience. At
the new and comfortable Ibis Island Hotel, hovering waiters outnumbered
sunbathers. It was the same at Luxor, where in the heat of the afternoon
barely a handful of sun-worshippers lay beside the Winter Palace's pool. The
moon was full, but there seemed to be no honeymooning couples under the
royal palms which once witnessed King Farouk's indiscretions.
For a century, tourism has been the life-blood of a town such as Luxor. Now
there is little for the sellers of King Tut tat to do but draw on their
waterpipes. The mood is one of dejection and, so far as one can tell, anger.
When we took a sail in a felucca, the captain made mint tea on his primus
stove. Suddenly he stood up and announced that if he found the 'bad men' who
had scared away the tourists, 'I will catch them and eat them with my
teeth]'
Luxor and Aswan have foreign-run luxury hotels to suit all pockets, although
for elegance and architectural distinction the Old Cataract Hotel at Aswan
is unsurpassed. Whether hotels have one star or five, though, they are all
short of guests. Ask the price of a room and managers say they are
negotiable.
Winter is peak season and, even now, Karnak, Thebes and the Valley of the
Kings are far from deserted, especially if you dawdle in the morning or
coincide with a cruise ship.
The best plan, for mature travellers with a sense of humour, is to reject
organised tours and travel independently. From Luxor, Cairo and Aswan, it is
possible to do all the major sites with guides hired through local
companies, or to do the sites alone. For around Pounds 25, you can hire a
taxi from 7am to 7pm.
After two centuries of tourism, it is almost banal to enthuse about the
monumental remains of the pharoahs, Ptolemies and Romans. In the Cairo
suburbs there are the Giza pyramids with the astoundingly elegant Barge of
Cheops - often skimped by tour companies. There is Memphis and the majestic
stepped pyramid at Sakkara.
In Upper Egypt, there is Luxor where, last October, to boost falling
revenue, Tutankhamen's tomb was reopened in the Valley of the Kings. Then
there are the temples of Karnak, Luxor, Abydos - where the head of Osiris
was said to rest - Dendera, and yet others.
Aswan is a prettier, less pressured town than Luxor, and the place you go to
for visiting the temples rescued from the waters of the Aswan high dam.
Philae is small and, even now, uncomfortably crowded. At the other end of
the dam, few people go to New Kalabsha where a family of tame sand foxes
plays in the sanctuary of Marul. Further upstream, reached by bus or
aircraft, lies Abu Simbel.
It is only possible to imagine what the ancient mystery cults might have
been like when there is silence in the huge temples. Peace reigns in the
huge Ptolemaic temple of Hathor at Dendera, where for centuries people went
from all over Egypt for the new year festivities.
Figures appear from the shadows, muttering the names of deities until paid
off with a note or two. On the temple's massive roof, it is completely quiet
and one sits for an hour or so, just gazing at the panorama with its
contrast between barren desert and cultivation.
In his book, Egypt, Land of the Valley, Robin Fedden described the Nile as
'like East Anglia with the form and tone of Provence'. It is a richly
beautiful landscape, utterly engrossing to watch. Egrets slowly criss-cross
the fields and hoopoes perch on the lemon trees. There are palm trees and
pigeon roosts, water buffalo and camels which sway past laden with sugar
cane.
Village houses are made of mud or bricks fired in kilns beside the road. If
their owners have made the pilgrimage to Mecca, they paint scenes from the
journey on the external walls. Electric pumps send Nile water gushing into
the clover and sugar cane, but the shaduf (buckets on pivots) and
Archimedean water wheel are still used.
The average fellahin family has six children, which explains why there are
so many people. Women squat outside washing clothes and making bread.
Children jog past, two or even three to a donkey, waving at tourists and
often darting into the road. Driving is best left to the Egyptians,
particularly at night, when the practice is to switch off headlights and
then flash them wildly at oncoming traffic.
The contrast between upper Egypt and Cairo, traffic-choked, squalid and
chaotic, could not be greater. Yet Cairo also has to be seen, and we found
four days too short. Its medieval heritage is one of the most impressive of
any city in the world, although shamefully neglected by the authorities.
Its principal Islamic monuments are architectural gems: Ibn Tulun, the
exquisite Madrasah of Sultan Hasan and the noble mausolea of the Mamluks in
the North Cemetery. Egyptians appear totally relaxed about non-Moslems in
mosques, providing they are modestly dressed (no shorts) and remove their
shoes. I would always cover my head, too, although many Arab women did not.
Even in seething Cairo, it was obvious how blessed a time it was to be
sight-seeing. At the Great Pyramid on a Friday afternoon, foreigners were
outnumbered by Cairenes picnicking in their best clothes.
More extraordinary still was our visit to Cairo's Egypt Museum. By
lunchtime, the Japanese and Arab visitors had gone, giving a parting caress
to the statues they passed. That left us almost alone in the upper
galleries, where case after case displays the Tutankhamen finds, his war
chariots, sandals, linen, furniture, throwing sticks and perfume jars.
It may be that our persons were at marginally greater risk in Egypt rather
than in rain-sodden London. (It last rained in Aswan four years ago.) Our
choice, however, was to believe people living or doing business in Cairo who
insisted on Egypt's reputation as an unusually safe place for foreigners.
Strolling in the evenings we felt completely safe. We succeeded in avoiding
gastric misery by eating conservatively and only in first-class restaurants.
The most unpleasant experience was a glass of Omar Khayyam rose - Egyptian
wine can be lethal.
All the guidebooks comment on Egyptians' warmth and kindness towards
foreigners, and they are right. The commonest word one hears is 'welcome'.
One of the next commonest is 'baksheesh' from children in the street. Part
of the scene is the begging, the need to be for ever tipping, and the street
hassling. Instead of letting these customs get under your skin, it is better
to ignore them as an inconvenience more than compensated for by the
Egyptians' good manners and love of a joke.
After all, it is Egypt's Islamic traditions which make a holiday there such
a rich experience. Inshallah - as pious Egyptians frame every future wish -
I will return to the Nile. As for the temples, the best time to be there may
have been now.
Patricia Morison's trip was organised by the Egyptian State Tourist Office:
168 Piccadilly, London W1. Tel: 071-493-5282. She flew Egypt Air to Cairo,
Luxor and Aswan, and in Cairo stayed at the Rameses Hilton, which is quiet
and central.
Sight-seeing and shopping are aided by using the three Tour Maps of Islamic
Cairo, available (Pounds 3 each) from the Travel Bookshop at 13 Blenheim
Crescent, London W11, tel: 071-229 5260.

FT  22 JAN 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and his companion Lucy Dicker are finding their trip round
world is hardly one long holiday: they have been hit by illness, injuries
and theft. They are still on course to ski every day in 1994 but events have
made the extra challenge of skiing 5,000 miles during the year a very tough
one.
Arnie reports from North America: 'After a hacking cough, I lost my voice
and then the use of my left arm after falling twice on my shoulder. We later
lost our video camera, stills camera and credit cards.
'But we've been given such a warm welcome everywhere that our spirits have
not been damped. We have already driven more than 4,000 miles and skied in a
score of US resorts - but if this is Saturday it must be Canada . . .'
Full reports on the expedition will appear each month in Weekend FT.
There is still time to win a skiing holiday for two in Zermatt or runner-up
prizes of champagne by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT
on January 1 (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).

FT  22 JAN 94 / Skiing: White-outs and bolt-holes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh snow is a little like make-up - it can hide the wrinkles of the
starkest ski resort and make it appear snug, cosy and even attractive.
Tignes, great ski area that it is, has always had an unfortunate reputation
for being ugly, which I never thought it fully deserved, even without snow.
But then, ugliness is in the eye of the beholder.
Having seen Tignes recently with almost more snow than it knew what to do
with, I found myself feeling quite affectionate towards it, especially up at
Val Claret, where a magical circle of bars and restaurants provided a
nightly welcome as we waded through the ever-increasing snowdrifts from our
self-catering apartment in Hameau du Borsat. (Somehow, despite one's best
intentions, self-catering apartments never produce much in the way of
catering when competing with the smell of garlic wafting in from nearby
restaurants.)
Because Tignes is above the tree-line, skiing through almost constant
snowfall can become quite wearing after a couple of days, and eating out
becomes especially comforting.
During our stay, the best snow was high on the Grande Motte, now quickly
accessible via the gleaming yelow and blue 'caterpillar' funicular which
rushes dizzily through rock and ice to the top in seven minutes.
Here we enjoyed a rare treat - a break in the weather which allowed the sun
to hover in a cloudless blue sky. It was suddenly so warm that we were able
to bask outside the Restaurant Panamarique and soak up the inspirational
scenery before an exhilarating descent back to Val Claret.
We didn't enjoy such luck the following day: attempting a similar run, we
were enveloped in a white-out and had to ski virtually blind. At times like
this, shelter and lunch loom large in your thoughts and we found a tasty
bolt-hole.
The 600 students battling it out in the British Universities' Ski
Championship did not enjoy quite the same options: come blizzard or
white-out, they carried on at a relentless pace and it came as no surprise
that the Scottish contingent - used to skiing in all weathers  - dominated
the proceedings. The only regret was that cheering them on  - or even seeing
them - was well nigh impossible.
Such was the concentration of snow that even a visit to neighbouring Val
d'Isere had been fraught with difficulty. However, we made the effort and
crawled down in our game little car where we bumped into Martin and Graham
Bell, still ski-racing for Britain after all these years.
Alberto Tomba, the Italian slalom ace, is another regular visitor and
Charles Arnould, director of the Hotel Latitudes, told us that he had been
let loose in the kitchen to cook his own pasta.
Arnould recalled: 'We tried to persuade him to let us cook it for him but he
was adamant. It's the same whenever he vistits us, he always insists on
cooking his own pasta.'
Perhaps Tomba and I should swap accommodation next time we are in the area:
he would make good use of a self-catering apartment and I would love to be
cooked for and waited on hand and foot at a four-star hotel.
Travel arrangements and accommodation in Tignes for Arnie Wilson, the 600
racers from 40 universities, plus 700 other non-racing students, were made
by Touralp (UK) Ltd, tel: 071-602 1952

FT  22 JAN 94 / Gardening: Wild beauty tamed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The more you see, the sharper your tastes become. Gardeners spend their
middle years forgetting that they began by liking things which now seem
beneath them. Time passes, tastes broaden and we all come back for another
look at the old untouchables.
I am not about to praise heather. Instead, I must pay a tribute to an
outstanding performer of the past three months, although its name conjures
up a bush with branches like fishbones, covered with berries which are much
too bright for their background of yellow brick. Cotoneasters are given a
wide berth by gardening converts (by converting they feel they have escaped
from them). Like most converts, they have bolted too quickly and owe their
past another look.
Throughout this winter, cotoneasters have been magnificent. Huge crops of
berries are supposed to predict a cold winter, but we can now infer that a
huge crop on a cotoneaster predicts floods and an earthquake. There is more
to the family than the common horizontalis, the fishbone form which turns up
on home extensions. Think of China, their natural home, of bees, berries and
beauty when nothing else is out.
A bad plant can also be a good plant in a bad place. The fishbone
cotoneaster will grow anywhere, even in a wind-corridor beside the dustbins,
but we should not assume that the rest of the family deserves nothing
better. It includes some star turns, of which my favourite is Exburyensis,
an evergreen hybrid which was bred by one of the Rothschilds' gardeners. Its
berries are a heavenly shade of pale yellow and appear from late October
onwards. The narrow leaves are up to 5in long and remain green while the
berries are at their best.
This fine plant will grow on a wall and so gardeners tend to put it on a
north wall believing it will grow anywhere. And it will, reaching 12ft and a
manageable width.
But it is twice the plant if it faces west or south-east: the sun plays on
the berries and the plant can be brightened in the summer by a clematis
growing through its stem.
Its pair in the family is another hybrid, cornubia, which also arose at
Exbury. No other cotoneaster has such brilliant red fruit and it remains
dazzling well into November. Again, it tends to be tucked into shade or
pinned on to angular walls between London neighbours.
Left to itself, it will spread far and wide and develop too many side-stems.
It is much better if it is pruned each spring and limited to a single trunk
and encouraged into the shape of a tree. I have seen superbly-trained
Cornubias, pinned up a west-facing wall on London houses where its growth
has reached to the fourth floor after six years.
These two children from Exbury are exceptional evergreens, but there is an
equal from the wild which gardeners underestimate. Cotoneaster lacteus was
brought back from Yunnan 80 years ago, but gardeners neglect it because they
think it must be ordinary, a plant for cover beneath trees. After watching
it nearby, I realised that it has magic.
The way to grow it is as an evergreen hedge, lightly clipped in early spring
and allowed to reach a height between three and six feet. The hedge is thick
to the base if you clip it from its first year onwards.
It is cheap, completely hardy and varies in colour between a grey-green when
its shoots are young and fiery show of berries as the season ends.
On a clipped hedge they are prolific so long as you clip early and allow the
plants to flower in early July. The berries and evergreen cover are so good
that I prefer this variety to a hedge of franchetti, a more elegant shrub
when in leaf but not so bright in berry or so evergreen.
On both accounts, I prefer Cotoneaster conspicuus decorus which has reached
us from Tibet. This Tibetan in exile will grow almost anywhere in Britain
and bears the most beautiful berries in light shade. It lasts longer than
any other because the birds seem to ignore it. But it spreads to a height of
about three feet and makes a clump, not a hedge.
There is more, then, to this family than fishbones and too much scarlet. I
think we forget what wild beauties we have tamed. Life on an urban fencing
panel is a far cry from a hillside in western China. The more we see
cotoneasters pinned and splayed against a bad background, the harder we find
it to imagine them growing in a romantic site in an uncluttered landscape.
We need to disassociate them from the setting which we have imposed and then
we will start to recognise what useful beauty this despised family brings
with it.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Rome shows its warm smile in winter - Even after an
ordeal by traffic chaos, Tom Fort is enchanted by the golden and ancient
beauty of Italy's capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the balcony on the top of the palazzo, the Roman morning had a golden
tranquillity. The sun had risen beside the absurd bulk of the monument to
Victor Emanuel, making the curved tiles on the roofs below me glow, and
touching the ochre and apricot walls of the ancient buildings around.
Looking from left to right, I could see the Campidoglio, then the solemn and
severe Jesuit church of Gesu, the grandiose church of San Carlo ai Catinari,
and the shining dome of Sant' Andrea Della Valle. Garibaldi on his horse
frowned from the distant shadows of the Janiculum.
But the pale spiral above Sant' Ivo's church restored light and gaiety,
while across the river rose St Peter's, with the grey, professorial mass of
the Collegio Romano in the foreground to my right.
At ground level, peace gave way to mechanised bedlam. It was the last week
before Christmas, and Rome was going about its business in characteristic
style. I was there to assist a brother whose business is supplying smoked
salmon.
I was thrown the keys of the car, piled high with packages for delivery, and
told to be on my way. With my map-reading guide, a Scottish lady of noble
birth, thoroughly Romanised and highly diverting company, I set off, palms
damp, mouth dry, heart quaking.
Up the Via della Gatta we went, with the soaring walls of the palazzo above,
then round to the Piazza Venezia, where all Roman journeys seem to begin and
end. There the ordeal by fire is faced. From a dozen directions the streams
of traffic flood, bouncing over the cobbles, weaving, swerving, tacking,
darting, while a policeman on a pedestal seeks to restrain chaos from
turning into warfare.
I trust it is not xenophobia which suggests that the manners of the Roman
motorist are atrocious. No one lets anyone through, or says thank you. The
grateful wave is unknown; manual gestures are for impugning virility or
parentage. The dominant characteristic is a tense, vigilant aggression,
underpinned by contempt for all other road users and a finely tuned,
instinctive sense of timing.
The most dangerous drivers, they say, are nuns, who are inhibited by
Christian charity from observing the unwritten rules. I watched a sister
attempting to steer a Fiat Uno full of fellow sisters into a space big
enough for a two-ton truck.
Three times they all got out to examine the nature of the problem, while
behind them an almighty snarl developed. At last patience was exhausted. A
horn sounded, triggering a cacophony, as the black habits jumped aboard and
the little car edged forward.
Though I never learned to drive alla Romana, I acquired the disregard for
others necessary for survival. And I began to enjoy being a delivery boy.
The pre-Christmas period is one of frenzied labour for my brother.
Far and wide we journeyed, Caroline and I: to hideous hotels, where cocky
jobsworths tried in vain to duck paying; to friendly bars, where a
cappuccino and sticky bun were gladly given; to a princess who demanded a
startling discount and would not back down; to a smart restaurant where the
head waiter rebuked us for arriving when customers were present; to the
elegant Cafe Greco, where no such snobbery prevailed; and to a score of
flats and villas in suburbs posh and tatty.
It was not all work, though. On the Sunday before Christmas, in sunshine
warm enough for May, I set off towards the river. I strolled through the
prettiest square in Rome, the Piazza San Ignazio, which is built like an
opera set, and where at any moment you expect the shutters behind the
balconies to fly open and a Cavaradossi or Floria Tosca to appear.
I passed by the Pantheon, skirted the Piazza Navona and wandered past the
antique shops of the Via dei Coronari, until I came to the Ponte San Angelo,
with the squat, cocoa-coloured fortress of San Angelo beyond. Beneath the
Bernini figures on the bridge, a man with a ponytail was fishing.
Miracle of miracles, he caught something, a roach or chub or its Roman
equivalent, which must have weighed 1 lb or so. It kicked and glinted in the
sunlight, until he thrust it into a plastic bag full of water, in which it
floated belly up.
I watched him for a time, hoping in vain for a repeat performance. Then I
joined the crowds ebbing toward St Peter's. As midday sounded on the great
bells, the Pope appeared in cream robes at a distant window of the Vatican.
As his homily boomed over the loudspeakers, the throng below half-listened
and chattered.
A Dutchman resembling Samuel Beckett approached me. Billy Graham is the
reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he confided. 'I am afraid I do not agree,' I
replied. He looked mad enough to have a weapon under his raincoat, so I
drifted away, grinning amiably.
My brother took me to lunch at a resplendent villa near the Coliseum. I was
introduced as the fishing correspondent of the Weekend FT, and told the
hostess of my Rome exclusive: how I had seen a fish being caught in the
Tiber. She seemed impressed; in the main, though, the talk was not of fish
but, as so often during my stay, of the remorseless exposure of the
cancerous corruption of Italian public life.
Politically rudderless, Italy is sunk in recession. Trade in the smart shops
was sluggish and the restaurants were quiet.
Other aspects of life were blessedly unchanged. The market in the Campo dei
Fiori pulsed with life and colour, and the ice-creams at Giolitti's  -
visciole, fragola, myrtillo, mora - were as mouth-watering as ever.
It was nine years since I had been in Rome, and I had forgotten how lovely
the city is; lovelier still in winter than in the heat-soaked,
tourist-infested frenzy of summer, and friendlier.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Motoring: Mercedes aims for youth market and misses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
First, a cautionary tale. There was an old and much respected current
affairs magazine. New copies were read in the libraries of London clubs and
England's great houses and in first-class train and aircraft seats
everywhere. And old ones in doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms.
A few years ago the publishers decided its readers were getting old. We
must, they said, make our magazine appeal to the affluent young. So they
changed its editorial approach and waited for the subscriptions to roll in.
Nothing happened.
So what does this have to do with a motoring column? Substitute
Mercedes-Benz for magazine and a picture emerges.
Until recently, Mercedes-Benz was seen by financially successful people as
the world's most desirable car. Heads of state and captains of industry rode
in big ones. Smaller cars with the three pointed star were the choice of
mainly middle-aged businessmen - and their wives.
They still are. But for several years younger potential customers have
looked elsewhere, feeling they were not yet old enough to drive a Mercedes.
They went for BMW and Audi instead. (It is a problem Honda and Volvo are
familiar with.)
So, when it was time for the best-selling 190 to be replaced by the new
C-Class, Mercedes-Benz saw its chance. It knew what to do. Make the styling
curvier; use more powerful, multi-valve engines; improve the handling; and
liven up the paint colours and interior trim.
Has it done the trick? Are the affluent and trendy deserting their BMW
3-Series and 5-Series, their Audi 80s and 100s? It is early days. The new
compact Mercedes is selling well. But if BMW and Audi are worried about
their customers being seduced by the C-Class, it has not started to show.
From a little over Pounds 18,000 on the road, it is not cheap, though
neither is it extravagantly expensive. But it will hold its value. Number
crunchers at fleet management companies forecast that three years motoring
in a C-180 will cost less per mile than in a comparable Ford Mondeo or Rover
600.
I dipped into the C-Class collection some months ago in Germany. More
recently, I got to know a C-180 well during a week spent driving one in
Britain. The three-pointed star I always find reassuring to drive behind was
much less obvious than it had been on the 190 because the bonnet swept down
so steeply.
There was more space inside. The boot was even bigger. The driving position
was familiar. The 1.8-litre, 16-valve engine - slightly more muscular than
the old 190 E's 2-litre - was unexpectedly vocal during hard acceleration
but nearly silent when cruising on a motorway. The C-180 handled neatly,
rode as though it were a bigger car and was everything one expects of a
Mercedes-Benz.
Except, that is, for the interior. Mercedes-Benz offers the C-Class in four
versions - Classic, Esprit, Elegance and Sport. Differences are mainly in
trim level; Classic is the entry model, Esprit has lowered suspension and a
folding back seat; Elegance, a powered sunroof and windows; and Sport, alloy
wheels and stiffer springs. Never mind the names. You can have a 1.8, 2.0 or
2.2-litre four-cylinder or 2.8-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, or
four or five cylinder diesels of 2.1 and 2.5-litres capacity, with any trim.
I drove a C-180 Elegance. I should have known it was the luxury version from
the touches of polished wood veneer. But the interior ambience was otherwise
strictly fleet model Vauxhall Cavalier. The disagreeably patterned fawn
cloth trim may have youth appeal, though I doubt it. It certainly has none
for me.
All I can say in mitigation is that some of the other C-Class cars I drove
in Germany plumbed greater aesthetic depths. They were trimmed in cloth that
looked like surplus stock from a cheap-furniture factory. Standard colours
of the C-Class include primrose yellow and baby blue; shades I suppose the
naff interiors deserve.
But how can they do this to my favourite car? Do they really think this
lapse of good taste will be a turn-on for the under-30s? And finally, can
anyone please tell me what is the German for: 'don't throw the baby away
with the bathwater'. Without a rethink at Stuttgart, I fear that is what
Mercedes-Benz just might do.

FT  22 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: The first big-name designer - An exhibition
which harks back to a golden era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A collection of work by C F A Voysey, one of the most famous designers to
embrace the philosophies of the Arts and Crafts movement, will be on display
at the Design Museum in south west London from Monday.
Voysey was possibly the first of the big-name designers, the Sir Terence
Conran of his day. His furniture, his glass and cutlery - and most of all
his designs for wallpapers and textiles for Alexander Morton &amp; Co - came to
be as sought-after and easily recognisable to turn-of-the-century shoppers
as pieces by Philippe Starck and Vico Magistretti are today.
He worked during a golden era of British design when the whole of Europe
looked to see what Voysey and his friends - including George Walton,
Archibald Knox, Ernest Gimson and C R Ashbee - were up to.
But Voysey's interest and importance goes way beyond the fact that he
designed pretty things. He approached his work in a profoundly serious way,
believing that individual creativity, even idiosyncrasy, mattered greatly -
not simply as a matter of personal preference but because for him it was an
essential part of a civilised community.
***
He saw it as a means of keeping soul-destroying standardisation and
bureaucracy at bay. It went with having the courage of one's convictions,
with having standards that were incorruptible and absolute.
He is generally credited with being the first to consider the importance of
the complete design, 'designing from the inside outwards', believing that a
house, for instance, should be a composite whole and that the building, the
interior and all the minutiae which make it up should work harmoniously
together.
Thus he liked to design everything himself from the building to the light
fittings, cutlery, carpets and furniture. A house for him, far from being a
'machine for living in' was a place for spiritual as well as material
shelter: 'A serene port in the storm.'
All his instincts led him to like simplicity, light and clarity. His
graceful houses, as Claire Catterall, the curator of this exhibition puts
it, 'filled with light, brought a breath of fresh air to the dark, formal
monumentality characteristic of most buildings of the Victorian period.'
His furniture designs were plain, yet graceful, usually made from untreated,
unpolished wood and incorporating simple, almost Shaker-like motifs such as
pierced hearts.
Like the Shakers, he too believed in a connection between beauty and God.
'All true culture,' he said, 'depends upon the love of truth, the love of
beauty and the love of God, and can never grow otherwise.'
Fine aesthetics were thus much more than just an aesthetic matter - they
were of moral import, too.
On show at the Design Museum will be some of his architectural drawings,
furniture and fittings, fabrics, wallpapers as well as objects as diverses
as telephone boxes and gas fires.
The exhibition, from the private collection of a family member, is sponsored
by BhS and is on at the Design Museum, Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD from
January 24 to April 24.

FT  22 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: Hello country cousins - What do you need to
wear to avoid looking like an untutored townie? Avril Groom advises on how
to dress for the great outdoors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM

<TEXT>
The country hick in town has been a source of fun for centuries, from The
Country Wife to Crocodile Dundee. Less has been made of the reverse
situation but now the wellington is on the other foot. Increasingly
insulated from rural reality, the town mouse is likely to make sartorial
mistakes when faced with the countryside.
Country dressing has codes which slowly change and which may no longer fit
the townie's stereotyped vision. The owner of a West End country outfitters
who divides his time between London and the shires says he now sees far more
khaki wax and loden in SW1 than in Wiltshire.
The aims of country dressing are to keep warm and dry, and to merge
discreetly with the surroundings. There are several ways stylistically to
achieve this but all are based on the same principles - the build-up of
practical layers to vary depending on the weather.
So far, outer layers have mostly exercised the minds of technical fabric
experts. A fine membrane of waterproof but 'breathable' Goretex or
dry-cleanable Sympatex now lurks, unseen and efficient, inside both
traditional tweed shooting coats and casual padded parkas.
Tough, Goretex-lined cottons have threatened the supremacy of wax finishes
though traditionalists still swear by heavy 'farmer's weight' wax for real
rain and thorny terrain, and more colour variety has given these coats a new
lease of life.
The waterproof leather which Timberland pioneered 20 years ago now makes
coats as well as boots and ways of keeping it supple through years of
wetting and drying are being developed.
The inner layers of all-weather clothing are now coming under scrutiny.
Cotton fleece fabrics are popular to provide warmth and filter moisture away
from the body, but they are bulky. Fleece finishes are now being applied to
thinner cofton knit fabrics to wear as underlayers. So-called thermal
underwear has also evolved, with finer, softer fibres, such as silky-feeling
Tactel, and a higher aesthetic element.
In fashion's current layered mood everything can be on show not least, when
the going gets warm, a lace-edged fine-knit 'body' or a ribbed collarless
T-shirt. Knickerbox's deep green, lace-trimmed thermals or Levis' dark
rib-knits are good country colours.
Style is as essential as practicality. The art of country layers is that
they should look artless but still as if they belong together. The effect
may have taken time and thought to achieve but no-one should ever know this.
The easiest way is to pick one of the classic country styles and stick
broadly within it, adding one or two surprise elements to prevent
stereotyping.
For instance, young countryfolk like the pioneer style of padded parkas,
chunky sweaters, lumberjack shirts and tough cord or fatigue-style trousers.
Break this outfit up with a still-bulky, heraldic-looking sweater based on a
point-to-point jockey's jumper, or a soft tartan jacket that conveys more of
British tradition than backwoods US.
The popular Navajo-style mix of blanket jackets and denim needs sleek, plain
suede or Aran-pattern knits to stop it looking like the costume for a
B-movie version of Hiawatha.
The swathes of knitted layers, mostly cashmere, which the rich favour for
country wear need to be in subtle mis-matched neutrals and contrasted with a
coarser-textured, bulky overlayer to have the sharp edge of current fashion.
And the twills, cords and waxes of English country-house style shape up with
a new palette of rich autumn shades and a touch of bold knit pattern or
lumberjack check.
The quickest way to spot an untutored townie is by the feet. Fine leather
shoes well-spattered with mud are inappropriate. People whose dress code
demands polished leather can choose Sam Walker's shiny but water-repellent
brown boots, or Cole-Haan's robust but elegant-looking styles. The more
rugged still choose Timberland or the even tougher French Paraboot, footgear
of the French Foreign Legion.

FT  22 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: Carving a crafty niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who are tempted to think of wood-carving as a simple utilitarian
skill, the touring Crafts Council exhibition will be an eye-opener.
Like all real crafts, woodcarving has a rich and interesting past and,
equally importantly, a vibrant present. The two are intimately connected and
for those who are interested in the craft it is the exploration of the links
between the present and the past that makes this exhibition so illuminating.
The carving of wood for domestic use - whether it be a butterpat-maker in
Somerset, a stirring spoon in Zimbabwe, a drinking vessel in Indonesia, an
old printing-block in India - goes back thousands of years but what gives
joy to the eye and a lift to the heart is the love and skill which carvers
have brought to their craft.
Here, too, is a chance to come across much grander work - pieces by such
luminaries of the craft scene as Ernest Gimson, Sidney Barnsley, Eric
Sharpe, George Jack - as well as what is probably, for scholars of the
genre, the highlight of the exhibition, the panel by Grinling Gibbons, whose
work in the late 17th century is generally agreed to mark the apogee of the
craft.
It is divided into sections, encompassing architectural applications,
furniture and fine woodwork, the home (food and drink); the home (personal
effects); recreation (outdoor life and music, games and toys); and trades,
professional and crafts. And it gives a wide-ranging and comprehensive view
of the craft, from the 17th century (Grinling Gibbons' panel) to the present
day.
We see carving that is ornate and almost over-blown (a mahogany candlestand
of unknown provenance); we see it weird and witty (Howard Raybould's mirror,
Fiona Clark's chameleon coathook, David Cox's International sound box); we
see it streamlined and fastidious (John Makepeace's rhythm chair); we see it
friendly and domestic (the kitchen and domestic utensils).
Those who are devotees of Guy Taplin will be pleased to see one of his
boldly carved ducks.
If you favour a strong contemporary air you should look to the furniture and
fine woodwork section and the work of David Cox, Howard Raybould, and Tim
Stead. They give an invaluable view of the contemporary scene. Lindsay
Anderson's oil-painting on lime-wood is a unique work, haunting, moving and
inspirational. It shows just what modern woodworkers have to offer, whether
in the public or private domain.
Of course, as in any exhibition, some works are more to one's personal taste
than others - this is exactly as it should be. This is a celebration of
diversity.
For me, as for many others, possibly the most moving pieces are not the
grand panels and elaborate carvings, they are the small, homely pieces - a
lovespoon, made by an unknown Welsh sailor, a snuff box made by a blind
carver, David Lewis' potato masher, a biscuit print roller, and a
gingerbread mould.
My favourite work in the whole exhibition, the one I long to take home and
keep, is a late 19th century malt shovel, lovingly carved and exquisite in
its simplicity.
This exhibition is a timely reminder that simply because things have a
utilitarian role to play in life there is no reason for them not to be
beautiful - rather the reverse is true. Because they are the essential
elements of everyday life, it matters even more that they have an inherent
aesthetic appeal. The spoon that we use every day, the door we open all the
time, the hook we hang our coat on, the box we keep our trinkets in - that
these should be beautiful or witty, charming or dramatic matters.
Not for these carvers the simplest and easiest means to an end. The chance
to celebrate their craft has been seized and taken to the greater enrichment
of us all.
The Woodcarvers Craft is on the move and opens at the Usher Gallery, Lindum
Road, Lincoln LN1 1NN on January 30 (until April 5) and after that will go
on to Bradford in West Yorkshire, Glasgow and, finally, Hove in East Sussex.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Food and Drink: A nicer crowd in Hitler's old haunt - Giles
MacDonogh visits a Weimar hotel with a colourful past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weimar is unique. Elsewhere in Germany or Italy there are small towns filled
with palaces, but none has the literary associations of Weimar. Almost
everyone who was anyone in German literature spent some time there and many
made it their permanent home.
In spite of a couple of senseless American bombing raids in the last month
of the second world war, their relics are still there: you may still drop in
on Schiller in the morning, see Goethe before lunch and visit Nietzsche in
the afternoon.
Even under the old East German regime, Weimar enjoyed special privileges.
The presence of the National Theatre made it a sort of German
Stratford-upon-Avon. Those who went were often compelled by the vagaries of
East German transport to stay the night. Unlike other East German towns
there were plenty of places serving solid Thuringian food.
Since what the Germans now call 'the change', the food has improved beyond
measure. Arriving in a snowbound Weimar between Christmas and the New Year I
dropped in on the Weisse Schwan, the restaurant which Goethe so warmly
commended and which stands next to his house on the Frauenplan.
One west German gastronomic magazine has included it among the country's
'best tables'. I certainly enjoyed a seasonal roast goose with a fine,
crunchy consistency, served with Thuringian dumplings and shredded Savoy
cabbage. Apart from a few, cheap Italian restaurants-cum-pizzerias, most of
Weimar's tables existed before 1989. There is even, in the shadow of
Herder's church, a famous fish restaurant which does a thousand different
things to herrings.
One newcomer with a distinctly western liveliness about it is Zum Zwiebel in
the Teichgasse. The owners bought this old building for a song a couple of
years ago and turned it into the town's best pub-restaurant. The food is
wholesome and unpretentious. I liked my Soljanka soup: a spicy potion from
the Ukraine introduced to the East Germans by the Soviets. I sometimes think
that the recipe for Soljanka soup will be the only positive achievement the
Soviet Union leaves behind. I followed up the soup with a good, earthy, pork
knuckle.
Another place where one may eat local specialities is in the
Elephantenkeller on the Market Square. Here the dishes are more refined, and
the vaulted cellar with its stone arches is a rather more impressive
setting. Here is the place for red lentil soup and Thuringian Bratwurst with
mashed peas. Decent wines are served in 20cl jugs.
The Elephantenkeller is underneath the Hotel Elephant, one of Weimar's two
famous old hotels. The other is the Russischer Hof on Goetheplatz. But,
while the present owners of the Elephant have spent millions of D-Marks
putting the hotel back on its feet, no such rehabilitation has taken place
at the Russischer Hof. The menu in the main dining room may exhibit some of
the trappings of 'modern' German cooking; but the drab decoration, the
coffee, the poor orange juice and, above all, the sharp practices of the
waitresses in the breakfast room, made me more grateful that I was paying
that little bit more to stay at the Elephant.
Both the Russischer Hof and the Elephant are hotels with fabulous pasts; but
in our century it is the Elephant's story which has been the richer of the
two. The reason is simple enough: the Elephant was Adolf Hitler's favourite,
and it still bears his stamp. Even in the early years Hitler stayed at the
Elephant and nothing changed after he achieved power in January 1933.
On Schiller's 175th birthday, November 10 1934, Hitler arrived to celebrate
the occasion in Weimar. Two days later the Nazi Volkische Beobachter
newspaper reported: 'The Fuhrer lodged as always at the Hotel Elefant (sic)
in the Market Square which, until the late hours of the evening was
surrounded by a solid wall of people.'
That was the old Elephant, a building which dated back to 1521. In 1937,
Fritz Sauckel, Gauleiter of Thuringia and later organiser of wartime slave
labour, reported to Hitler that the Elephant was in danger of falling down.
Hitler decided that the old hotel should not be restored, but replaced by a
new building constructed by Hermann Giesler, architect of the Adolf
Hitlerplatz in Weimar,
It is well known that Hitler was passionate about architecture, but just how
large a role he played in the designing of the Elephant is revealed in
Giesler's autobiography.
The architect was summoned to Berlin to receive the commission. Hitler
wanted a modern hotel 'which expresses our feelings about life', he said. It
had to have a large hall, dining rooms and, facing on to the garden, a
large, light breakfast room which could serve for parties and be used
together with the hall. The hotel was to have all the 'requisite comforts .
. . it should combine elegance with solid execution in all its details,'
said Hitler. It was to be an up-to-date hotel with lifts, and telephones and
wireless sets in every room.
Turning to his Gauleiter he added: 'Sauckel, make sure that the prices of
the rooms remain low. Even if I don't drink alcohol myself I feel a hotel
bar is necessary. It could be placed in the cellar. It goes without saying
that there should be a cellar restaurant with its own kitchen for preparing
simple dishes.'
Hitler even demanded that the Elephantenkeller should be accessible from
both the hotel and the street. It still is.
The new 'Haus Elephant' reopened its doors in November 1938. Hitler came
down to look at the hotel and his flat overlooking the garden at the back.
When Giesler went to see him he had purloined a little Cranach from the
museum to hang in his room. 'Giesler, the name is fitting. It is not just a
hotel, it is a house in which I am happy to live.'
The Elephant has not changed much, except that you meet a nicer crowd of
people there these days. In clearing away the debris of the past, the new
owners - Flamberg Hotels - unwittingly pointed up the Giesler-Hitler
creation: the black marble surrounds to the portals have been put back.
Busts in the hallway add to the 1930s feel of the place. Only here and there
a little of that art which Hitler would have called 'degenerate' has been
hung on the walls. In the main hall, a strict double cube, comic strip
scenes from Wagner's Ring have been painted in the panels of what is now
called the 'Richard Wagnersaal'.
It was there that I spent new year's eve. At first with an elderly couple,
she from Halle he from Oppenheim-am-Rhein. Then I was moved to a table
occupied by three strong silent types from Dortmund who did not cheer up
until the third bottle of Franconian wine. Latterly I was joined by four
Americans and the party began to swing.
A couple of actors performed scenes from Goethe and, while we ate, a band
played popular tunes of the type which Richard Wagner would have paid to
avoid. Still, it fitted the mood of the occasion. When the bells were rung
at midnight we went out on to the balcony from where Hitler once hectored
the crowd in the market place. But on December 31 1993 we put it to better
use as we watched the festive fireworks break over Weimar's night sky.
It was a late night. When I awoke I found that the hotel had left a tray in
my room. On it I found a bottle of mineral water, an Alka Seltzer and a
little, pink marzipan pig. 'The pig brings good luck,' one of the
Dortmunders had told me. I could not see it doing anything for my stomach.
The present owners of the Elephant might wish to play down Hitler's role in
designing the new hotel and choose instead to remember the other worthies
who graced its beds and public rooms: Goethe, Schiller, Franz Liszt, Richard
Wagner and Thomas Mann; but Hitler's contribution is also part of Weimar's
extraordinary story, and they should realise an elephant never forgets.

Since my article on the progressive dilution of the major gin brands last
year I have received a number of letters from readers who have been scouring
their local supermarkets for an alternative to Gordon's. All of these gins
have retained the former standard strength of 40 per cent. Waitrose makes a
proper London Dry, but it it also sells another, cheaper gin at 37.5.
Several readers have also drawn my attention to two own-label gins which
have maintained the old level of alcohol: Tesco's and Morrison's. I
neglected to mention Bombay Gin made in Warrington, Lancashire, by a
subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan. It uses a wider range of botanicals, or
flavouring elements, than most and the flavouring material is steamed rather
than 'boiled up'. The result is a gin with a laudable complexity. It is sold
in Britain at the higher strength of 43 per cent and is perfect for a gin
and tonic.
One of Austria's most talented chefs, Herbert Lackner, was in London this
week to promote the Austrian food festival planned for the spring in the
Cafe Mediterranee, St James Court Hotel, Buckingham Gate, Westminster, SW1.
Lackner's touch with foods which can be the despair of amateur chefs -
sauerkraut and dumplings to name but two - is light and sure. If you think
Austrian food is all about hearty soups and one-pot dinners then this will
be an eye-opener. Lackner, of the Die Gersberg Alm in Salzburg, will cook at
the Mediterranee from March 7 to 25. Tel: 071-834-6655.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Food and Drink: What happened to taste? - Jancis Robinson is
scornful of the wine world's trend in technotalk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year at about this time Peter A. Sichel, one of Bordeaux's more urbane
wine producers, organises a London tasting of his wares (which includes
Chateaux Palmer, d'Angludet and a host of more commercially conceived
liquids).
A member of the Anglo/French/Scandinavian branch of a family whose origins
in the wine business go back to mid-18th century Germany, he has a broader
view of the wine world than many. Based in Margaux, a village famous for the
subtlety of its wines, he has expressed exasperation with what he perceives
as an infatuation, on the part of wine buyers and commentators, with big,
full-bodied, obvious wines.
His note accompanying this year's invitation, however, highlights a new
trend among wine commentators, if not quite (yet) in wine commentary.
He says: 'There have been gnomes making wine in Bordeaux for some 2,000
years, but they have generally been confined to the cellars, allowed out
only once a year in order to declare that the most recent vintage is the
best they have ever produced, before being returned to obscurity for another
12 months.
'We have learned that modern communications require that they reveal at
least some of their science. We have four highly proficient wine makers in
our company, so we are bringing them all to London for our annual tasting.'
He is no fool, this man. He is pandering, in the least servile way possible,
to the fact that over the past two or three years wine writers have become
increasingly besotted with what one might call the technotalk of wine.
People who, in the main, were only too proud of their innumeracy, or their
grade nine in physics O-level, now pin oenologists against the winery wall
and quiz them for hours on end about fermentation temperature gradients,
clone numbers, yeast strains, and the exact proportions of free-run juice
versus what came out of the Willmes - or was it Bucher? - press. Oh, and
what setting was the press on? I know this, because I do it myself.
What has come over us all?
We can use only a fraction of this information in print but, collectively,
we seem to be suffering an epidemic of Need To Knowness, rather like the
general newsgathering climate in the US after Watergate.
Not that there has been a Winegate. We are doubtless acting under the
influence of all those highly trained New World technicians who have the
inclination to substitute technotalk for an evocation of personal
philosophy, and the need to substitute it for historical anecdote.
It does sometimes help to know, for example, what the total acidity of a
wine is, but in most cases what is important is how acid it tastes, for
which no technotalk is needed.
Watch this space for a return to the mid 20th century school of wine writing
evoked by such book titles as Wayward Tendrils of the Vine and Stay Me With
Flagons.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Cookery: Easy on the appetite and the purse - Simple and
succulent squid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the meat feast of Christmas I favour simpler meals that major on fresh
fruit and fish. Fruit is easy to come by with apples, pears and citrus in
plentiful supply. The last tartly scarlet cranberries can still be found and
the first thin, sharp and juicy pink stalks of forced rhubarb are just
coming in.
Spankingly fresh fish presents more of a problem. Fishermen need holidays
like the rest of us and supplies are always erratic at the turn of the year.
Recent stormy weather has made matters worse. Such fish as is to be found on
fishmongers' slabs can look as hungover as some of the customers and it may
smell fishier than it should. Frozen offerings imported from farther flung
seas may prove a better bet.
Last week I bought a solid block of small, white squid and hacked my way
gratefully through them. Very delicious they were and modestly priced, a
double reassurance when faced, as one is at this time of year, by a
maelstrom of buff-enveloped bills that bring home the cost of Christmas.
A menu we particularly enjoyed - easy on the appetite, easy on the purse and
no hard labour for the cook - began with a salad of watercress and juicy
slices of pear scattered with shavings of Parmesan. Squid with saffron rice
formed the main course, and syllabub glasses filled with Bramley snow
brought dinner to an agreeable close.
SQUID WITH SPECKLED SAFFRON RICE (serves 6)
One of the attractive features of this dish is the fact that the rice can be
cooked ahead, packed into a mould and reheated when needed. This leaves only
the squid to cook just before serving - 5 minutes work at most.
1 1/2 lb squid;  1/2 lb cherry tomatoes;  3/4 lb basmati rice; 1 large
onion; 2 oz black olives; 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes soaked in olive oil; 1 1/2
pt fish stock; a generous pinch of saffron threads; a pinch of ground fennel
seed; a bay leaf; a few sprigs of thyme; a garlic clove; a little olive oil;
wedges of lemon or lime for serving.
Chop the onion finely and soften it in a little oil over very low heat.
Meanwhile, thoroughly wash the rice under a cold running tap and leave to
soak for 5 minutes. Pound the saffron strands with mortar and pestle and
soak them in a little of the hot stock.
Tip the drained rice into the onion pan and stir to coat every grain with
fat. Pour on the boiling stock, add some salt, the saffron liquid, ground
fennel, bay leaf and a sprig of thyme and bring to the boil. Cover tightly
and simmer for 5 minutes.
Cut the sun-dried tomatoes into snippets. Scatter them over the rice, cover
again and continue cooking for 5 minutes more or until the grain is tender.
Halve and stone the olives. Stir them into the cooked rice. Remove the bay
leaf and thyme. Check seasoning and spread the savoury mixture in a large
shallow dish to speed cooling. When cold, pack the rice firmly into an oiled
ring mould.
Clean the squid if this has not already been done, first pulling the heads
and innards out of the body sacs. Cut off the tentacles by slicing through
the web of flesh that bunches them together and remove the hard beaks from
the centres. Wash and dry the body sacs inside and out and slice across into
thin rings.
Skin the tomatoes and lay them in an oiled gratin dish. Sprinkle them with
leaves stripped from a sprig or two of thyme, add a grinding of pepper and
cover with a dome of foil.
Shortly before serving reheat the rice and bake the tomatoes. The rice,
loosely covered with oiled foil, will need about 20 minutes at 400`F (200`C)
gas mark 6. Slip the dish of tomatoes into the oven for the last 5-10
minutes only, at which point the squid can be cooked.
Dust the pieces of squid very lightly with seasoned flour and fry them in a
little very hot oil flavoured with a garlic clove cut in half. (Unless a wok
or other really large pan is used, it may be best to cook the squid in two
batches.) Fry over high heat, stirring frequently, until the flesh loses its
pearly translucence and becomes tender. A minute or two is plenty if the
squid are small; too long and they will turn from firm and tender to albino
rubber bands.
Discard the garlic and mix the cooked squid gently with the tomatoes.
Unmould the rice onto a hot serving dish, pile the squid and tomatoes into
the centre of the ring and garnish with wedges of lemon or lime.

FT  22 JAN 94 / FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion: A good meal, a bottle of
wine and 25 per cent off - Nicholas Lander updates the FT/Transmedia
invitation to 1,000 free meals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times restaurant offer starts on Monday.
It is still not too late to take part if you would like:
 - A 25 per cent discount on all food and wine consumed in one of the
restaurants on our list.
 - The chance to win a free meal for two. 1,000 free meals for two are on
offer to those taking part in the scheme during the three weeks starting on
Monday.
Some of our readers are likely to win more than one free meal. For every
time you eat at one of the restaurants in our scheme, you get 25 per cent
off the cost of that meal, plus an extra chance of winning a free meal for
two. And there is no limit on the number of free meals that you may win.
The key to this offer is a plastic card, the FT/Transmedia Restaurant card,
offered free for six months. How it works and how to get it are explained in
more detail below.
Since we announced the scheme at the beginning of the year, the number of UK
restaurants in the scheme has doubled to 210. The list on this page gives an
idea of the range; but the number is growing daily as Transmedia signs up
more participants.
In addition, there are 2,400 restaurants in the US which will accept the
card. If you use it in the US you will get the 25 per cent discount, but
will not be eligible for the promotional free lunch draw.
You will get a directory, regularly updated, of the restaurants in the
scheme. As the numbers grow, this will offer a wide choice of eating places
throughout the UK and in the main centres in the US.
The spread is already pretty good.
The main point of this scheme is that it does not just come to an end after
the promotional period. For the first three weeks you get the chance of
winning one of the 1,000 free meals, plus the 25 per cent discount.
For six months you get a 25 per cent discount without any cost. After that,
you can still use the card, but an annual charge will be made.
The mid 1990s is no time for another 'fine dining club', nor do FT readers
need reminding of where they can go for the best and, inevitably perhaps,
the most expensive cooking.
Your FT/Transmedia directory of British and American restaurants can provide
a much broader and, I hope, more useful service.
There are restaurants in which the chef/proprietor is the obvious
attraction: David Adlard in Norwich, Chris Oakes in Stroud, Richard Smith in
Moulsford, Stephen Bull in London and John Dicken at Dickens, Wethersfield,
Essex.
Restaurants around the City: Alba, Ashtons, Beauchamps, Mr Garraways and La
Paquarette.
Good neighbourhood restaurants which you can now enjoy more frequently:
Glaisters, SW10, Newtons, SW4, L'Artiste Assoiffe, W11, Waltons SW3,
Willoughby's N1, Crowthers, SW14 and the two branches of Hunter's in
Winchester and New Alresford, Hampshire.
Even restaurants in top London hotels - the Grosvenor House, the Mayfair and
several other Inter-Continental hotels - which will reduce the cost of your
overall stay in the West End.
There are also restaurants which can easily be appended to a more cerebral
experience - the Archduke just by the South Bank Centre, the Wigmore
Restaurant by the Wigmore Hall and Les Partisans in the centre of
Edin-burgh.
A collection of good wine bars and pubs with restaurants - Le Metro, SW3,
Fino's, W1, the Fox and Anchor, EC1, and the Ebury Street Wine Bar, SW1 -
and Japanese (Ajimura, W1), Chinese (Red, SW3; Yien, N10), Greek (Daphne,
N1), Indian (The Red Fort, W1 and Addab, W8), Thai (Bahn Thai, W1)
restaurants too.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Poker with the plastic pirates: David Spanier meets the men
gambling on turning Las Vegas into Disneyland with slot machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Eurodisney is hurting badly and America remains in semi-recession,
theme parks are booming on Las Vegas Boulevard, making Nevada's pleasuredome
bigger, more vibrant, more vulgar and more lucrative than ever.
Last month Kirk Kerkorian's MGM Grand, the world's largest hotel-casino cum
theme park - 5,005 rooms and 170,000 sq ft of gaming space - opened in Las
Vegas.
Kerkorian's project is so big that it is hard to comprehend. In London, the
site would cover an area from Cambridge Circus in the north to Downing
Street in the south, and from St James's Square in the west to the northern
end of Waterloo Bridge in the east. Yet, it is merely the latest in a series
of new theme-park casinos.
Last month the Luxor hotel-casino, a shiny black pyramid, opened. There,
guests 'tour' an indoor river Nile by barge to view the kitsch-Egyptian
interior. The light shining out from the top is claimed to be the most
powerful in the world.
A week after the Luxor's inauguration, the night sky was lit by the
spectacular destruction of the Dunes, one of the outdated, old-style casinos
which was blown up to celebrate the opening of Treasure Island.
This massive block stands next to the Mirage, built four years ago by
flamboyant entrepreneur Steve Wynn as first of the new theme-park properties
designed to set a trend of family-orientated entertainment.
In front of Treasure Island, a pirate ship and Sir Francis Drake's
Hispaniola face each other across the entrance to the casino, sails
billowing, crews aloft, pennants flying. Every half-hour, their cannons
flash and roar until one of the galleons, holed amidships, keels over and
slips under the water. The pirates always win.
Even in a town of gleaming synthetic wonders, however, the vast, blue-green
MGM Grand is something else. First, it is expensive: it cost Dollars 1bn.
Second, it is a challenge to the long-established and world-famous
Disneyland, not far away in southern California. Third, the very name MGM
(and its famous lion) tap into one of America's deepest cultural veins - the
magic of movies. The lion forms the 88ft-high gateway to the casino, opening
on to the famous yellow brick road which leads up to the emerald city of Oz.
The MGM Grand took only two years to build from start to finish: surprising,
since the casino area alone - to which people (mothers and fathers minus
children) are intended to gravitate after the theme park - is so big that it
is divided into four areas: the Emerald City, Monte Carlo, Hollywood, and
Sports.
Close by the MGM are two other new properties, the Luxor pyramid and the
Excalibur, 28 stories high and built on a medieval theme of jousting
knights.
Opposite is the Tropicana, a comparative pigmy of a casino-hotel with only
2,000 rooms, fronted by brooding Easter Island statues. Walkways over the
city's neon-lit Strip will link these casinos and help to reduce the
traffic.
Kerkorian, who is in his mid-70s, remains full of vim. He jogs and plays
tennis in between buying and selling companies.
He has spent a lifetime wheeling and dealing in casinos and airlines and
much else besides, yet has managed to remain a private figure. He describes
himself as 'just a country boy who got lucky.'
The question remains: why should a man of his age, already a millionaire
many times over, devote so much time, energy and money to building something
like the MGM Grand?
Kerkorian wanted to create the biggest and the most glittering casino the
world had seen.
He had done it before with the International (sold to the Hilton hotel
chain) and the first MGM (bought by Bally, the casino, hotel and health club
operator). But he likes the razzmatazz of casinos and wanted, yet again, to
go one better than anyone else.
'I can't see anything detracting from Las Vegas for many lifetimes,' he
says.
MGM's president is Larry Woolf, a quiet, laconic, witty man who started as
an assistant waiter in a restaurant. As chief executive officer, his task
was to pull together a variety of talents from different areas of the casino
business, and weld them into a team.
Woolf has no doubts that his boss has got it right: 'Kerkorian is a man who
stays above all the noise. He has wonderful judgment of what a business is
worth. Whether it's an airline or an automobile company or a casino, he
knows exactly the right price to buy or sell.'
The test of the MGM will be the theme park: if it attracts the public, the
gaming revenues will follow. Woolf says: 'We are going to give people
everything they want - and then some.'
Las Vegas continues to break records. In 1993 it drew about 22m visitors,
close to the total for all of Britain. Even in recessions, growth goes on,
if at a slower rate. Will that change? 'No,' says Bob Maxey, who led the
planning team at the MGM. 'The market is so deep, you can't even plumb its
depths.'
Yet, gambling on its own is not enough as Atlantic City, on the east coast
in New Jersey, has discovered - to its cost. The public is not so gullible:
most players understand that they will lose. The difference is that a visit
to Las Vegas includes excitement and entertainment.
The new theme-park casinos cater for family holidays. The razzle-dazzle mix
of themes - cowboy, circus, medieval, South Seas, Roman, oriental, movies,
space age - might seem garish, outrageous and artificial. But it crackles
with fun and energy.
Gambling remains the most important source of revenue in Las Vegas. However,
the days when the state of Nevada had a near-monopoly on legal gambling are
over. The moral stigma attached to gambling, especially in the conservative
mid-west and south, has faded. Gambling has been legalised in many places.
Lotteries - many for huge prizes - operate in 37 states and there is casino
gambling in 15 if riverboats and Indian reservations are included.
There are plans to make gambling legal in New Orleans, Kansas City and St
Louis. Beyond this, there is pari-mutuel (Tote) betting in many places on
horses, dogs and jai alai (a version of Basque pelota). In total, gaming
industries in the US had gross revenues in 1991 of about Dollars 26bn, or
0.6 per cent of the country's disposable income.
But the intense competition means that many of the gambling towns, resorts
and casinos will not survive. In Las Vegas itself, many of the older
properties have gone bust, overtaken by the mega-resorts. Kerkorian is
betting Dollars 1bn that the MGM Grand (slogan: 'Watch Us Roar in '94') will
become a beacon by which all other attractions measure their success.
Even so, it will have to fight to get the lion's share.

FT  22 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: More sex please, we're British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today, all being well, I shall hear what the Germans and the British think
of each other. Top journalists from each side will tell me about
'British-German National Stereotypes and the Media' at the Goethe Institute
in London.
This to stop the British depicting the Germans as ranting madmen in leather
coats or potbellied drunks in leather shorts.
But I dread it. As a patriot I think of the Island Race as honest,
upstanding, decent and so on. But recent events have only confirmed the
German impression that we are, in the words of Reiner Gatermann, London
correspondent of Die Welt, 'obsessed with sex'.
The Anglo-Saxon concern with other people's sex lives remains of some, but
dwindling, interest to most of our neighbours. The British are for their
part fascinated by the different attitudes in France, where a law on privacy
reinforces the national preference for ignorance about what happens behind
others' bedroom doors.
Few take much interest in Germany either, where attitudes are just as
easy-going. Many years ago the papers there reported that a politician was
robbed in a park; they did not mention that he was with a prostitute at the
time even though the fact was common knowledge.
The one occasion when the ban seemed to be lifted was in the case of the
skater Katarina Witt, but that was because of her alleged involvement with
the East German regime - and the note in the daily record kept by the Stasi
(secret police) read: 'Sexual intercourse: 8 minutes.'
German journalists can reel off a list of public figures and name their
mistresses. Yet the British stereotype of the Germans excludes relaxed,
irregular relationships; I had always assumed a German mistress would have
to be registered at a local Liaisons Registration Office, or
Stadtischeverhaltnismeldeamt. But this is not so.
The only expert on German sexual attitudes I have come across is Anne
McElvoy of The Times, now in Moscow. She originally made her name writing
from Berlin.
In another publication some time ago she recounted her experiences at the
hands of German men who sought a a deeper relationship with her. As I have
never been an attractive young woman and, anyway, have led a life of
invincible chastity, I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of her
observations, but they ring true.
They can be confirmed by those monumentally anaphrodisiac films on
late-night German television which consist of what one might call Tyrolean
erotica. It is evident that the notorious streak of romanticism in the
German soul does not extend to transactions between the sexes.
If German attitudes resemble the French, their basis is entirely different.
Many leaders of the Third Reich demonstrated that a seamlessly respectable
domestic life did not preclude revolting excesses elsewhere.
This provides the other side of a coin familiar to readers of this paper: a
colourful and varied emotional life does not preclude political integrity.
The French don't even make that connection: for them the acquisition of a
mistress is a reward of success which not only marks out the man, but gives
the woman a useful leg up the ladder of life.
In Germany, attitudes are based on the view 'boys will be boys'. The Germans
ally their preparedness to accept the inevitable with a tolerance of
self-indulgence unknown in Anglo-Saxon puritanism. 'Illicit' sex is a safety
valve.
Maybe writing about sex is the British safety valve. Certainly I am
sometimes surprised by the concerns of many of my colleagues - and then
think that they must have much more fun than I do in pursuing their
professional interests.
As the man from The Sun said to me: 'It's more interesting than the Belgian
budget.' Perhaps I too suffer from the real vice anglais, prurient
voyeurism.
In his recent reporting of the British scene, Die Welt's Gatermann has been
most struck by the scale of the investigative resources deployed in
reporting MPs' sex lives. It was inspired by the apparent contrast between
what government ministers were preaching and what they were practising.
'I would not like to dig into the private lives of people who are so
sanctimonious,' Gatermann told me. He meant the lives of the journalists,
not the politicians.
Today's Goethe Institute seminar is designed to tackle the 'negative
aspects' of stereotypes like, presumably, 'the British are obsessed by sex.'
But what if they are founded on fact?

FT  22 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Put yourself in the picture -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several times over the last year or two a customer has put a page from a PC
magazine under my nose and asked: 'Why can't I have pictures like that on my
computer?'
The advertisement in question usually shows a screen from a personnel
records database, and among all the lines of text describing the employee's
address, national insurance number, salary and so on, there is a picture of
the employee - usually a sultry brunette.
Not only are managers interested in storing pictures of their staff on
computer, especially sultry brunettes, but if they could hold pictures of
their products that might be even more useful. An instantly-available
picture on a computer screen could be invaluable for a salesman
demonstrating a range of products, for an order clerk taking a customer
order, or for anyone needing just to check what the product looks like.
Pictures on a computer system mean graphics - and graphics mean Windows 3.1.
Unfortunately, apart from a few cheap systems at the bottom end of the
market, nobody writes stock control packages under Windows. They write them
under fast, secure environments such as DOS and Unix, which do not lend
themselves to graphics.
Technical problems have made the idea impractical. Graphics files are
enormous, with a single picture occupying several hundred kilobytes of disk.
It would take an age to load the picture from disk into memory. And moving
files of this size from one PC to another would bring your whole network
grinding to a halt.
Recently I have seen a product which solves these problems - DOSview. This
provides excellent quality pictures and works with your existing stock
program written under Dos, Unix, Novell or whatever. There is no need to
reprogram the existing stock system, which continues to work just as before.
You simply run DOSview alongside it.
DOSview has been developed by Thinkware / JSS, a jewellery manufacturer and
distributor which is now marketing it.
Using DOSView you first take a photograph of the product and store the image
on file. Thinkware use either a video camera or a scanner directly linked to
the computer. The operator slides the piece of jewellery under the video
camera, which then photographs it, transmits it to the computer and stores
it as a 300k standard graphics (Tiff) file. DOSview then automatically
compresses the Tiff file, reducing it from 300k to 8k, with only a marginal
loss of picture quality.
So DOSview has solved the first problem. It enables you to build up a
database of pictures, each of which is a manageable size.
Displaying the picture is simplicity itself. Suppose you are running your
stock control package and want to see a picture of stock item number 123456.
Simply highlight the number 123456 and press an F key. DOSview looks through
its database, and displays a picture of item 123456 in a window on the
screen. You can zoom to display the picture over the full screen. You can
show pictures of several items at once and even in full-screen mode the
quality is good.
DOSview runs under Windows. It links to your existing stock package by
saving the number 123456 to the Windows clipboard as a graphics image, and
comparing this image with the list of part numbers in its own database of
pictures. No other link is required.
The beauty of this approach is that it bypasses a host of technical
problems: no need to interface with proprietary file formats, the curse of
accounting software; and no problems integrating Windows-based graphics with
other text-oriented operating systems.
I spoke to two users of DOSview. Both were enthusiastic. One runs a 15-user
Unix system. He said DOSview had taken half a day to install and has worked
perfectly since. The other had teething troubles but said this was partly
because he had bought some of the equipment himself. DOSview is an assembly
of equipment made by different manufacturers. A start-up package of a
software, video camera, a beefy 486/66mhz 200mb PC to run the graphics and
interface cards costs about Pounds 5,000. If you buy all the parts from
Thinkware it takes responsibility if anything goes wrong.
Several software suppliers have expressed an interest in DOSview. First off
the blocks is SBS, whose Exchequer accounts package I have praised before
(tel: 0202-298008). They will offer a DOSview link in their new order
processing package due out in February.
Other potential users are companies that have a stock or personnel system
and want to upgrade it to store images. To date, the only options available
have been time-consuming, complicated and expensive. Thinkware has provided
a pioneering product which is cheap, ingenious, elegant - and works.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A traveller's tax allowance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughter is spending a year travelling and plans to return on April 9,
1994. Her only income is from renting out her flat, and a small amount of
dividend income and building society interest.
Does she qualify for her personal allowance to set against her income in
1993/4? Would it make any difference if she returned before April 5, 1994?
Every Commonwealth citizen is entitled to a personal allowance, regardless
of whether they are resident in the UK, by virtue of section 278(2) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as amended. You may like to ask your
tax office for the pamphlets IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to
tax in the UK) and IR87 (Rooms to let: income from letting property).
Even if your daughter is not a Commonwealth citizen, she may still be
entitled to a personal allowance for 1993-94 on some other grounds.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A home or a tax liability?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My parents are both over 80. They have little income: a pension and interest
from a Pounds 35,000 fixed deposit with a building society. Their only
substantial asset is a four bedroomed house in London worth about Pounds
300,000.
They have made a will in which each leaves everything to the other and
ultimately to me as their only child. Is this the most efficient method of
minimising inheritance tax?
Assuming that all assets are left to the surviving spouse, then on the death
of that person, inheritance tax of Pounds 74,000 will be payable as the
first Pounds 150,000 would be covered by the nil rate band and the balance
would be subject to tax at 40 per cent.
We assume that the building society deposit should remain in the estate of
the surviving spouse to provide income. For inheritance tax purposes, the
most efficient approach would be to own the house as tenants-in-common and
for a half share of the house to be left in trust for the children with the
surviving spouse retaining the other half. This would utilise the nil rate
band on the first death, thereby saving Pounds 60,000 of inheritance tax and
reducing the tax charge on the second death to Pounds 14,000.
While this would be tax-efficient, the surviving spouse may not feel secure.
The children could, in theory, force a sale of the home. A trust can be used
to improve the position but there can be no greater financial security than
owning the property in your own right. This reply was provided by Barry
Stillerman of Stoy Hayward.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Investing while abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I plan to go to Singapore for two years to work full-time. I intend to
return to the UK at the end of the contract.
I wish to leave my building society deposits and equity investments in the
UK, except that I will ask for the interest on the former to be paid gross.
I do not plan the income from these investments to be remitted to Singapore
so that (as I understand) this income is not taxable there.
1) How will the tax on the interest income be calculated for the three
years?
2) Shall I be able to reclaim the tax credit on the dividend income received
during these years? If so, at what rate?
3) Is CGT payable on disposals of my present investments if they are made
during my absence abroad but before April 5, 1996?
4) Am I eligible to make PEP investment in full for the tax years of my
departure and return?
5) Would my non-resident status and / or my liability for tax on foreign and
UK income be affected if I retain the directorship of a UK company?
1) The interest will be fully taxable in the UK, subject to your personal
allowance. It is doubtful whether you will be able to arrange for it to be
paid without deduction of tax; if you do, your tax credit payments for
1995-96 will be restricted accordingly, as explained in concession B13 in
the free booklet of extrastatutory concessions, IR1.
If the interest is subject to tax in Singapore, the rate of UK tax for the
period of your residence in Singapore may be limited to 15 per cent, by
virtue of article 7A of the Singapore-UK double taxation agreement (as
amended in 1977).
2) To the extent that your personal allowance for 1995-96 exceeds your UK
interest, you will be entitled to tax credit payments at 20 per cent (on the
aggregate of the relevant dividends and their tax credits). If the dividends
are subject to Singapore tax, you may be entitled to tax credit payments at
a minimum rate of 5 per cent (on the aggregate) for the period of your
residence in Singapore.
3) It is possible that you will be exempt from CGT in respect of sale
contracts made in 1995-96, either because you will be regarded as neither
resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK for that year, or by virtue of
article 9 of the double taxation agreement: 'A resident of one of the
Contracting States who does not carry on business in the other Contracting
State through a permanent establishment situated therein shall be exempt in
that other Contracting State from any tax on gains from the sale, transfer
or exchange of capital assets.' However, you have not given us enough
precise data for a firm opinion, so you should seek local professional
guidance if the amounts of tax are large enough to justify the expense.
4) Yes. Ask your tax office for pamphlet IR89 (personal equity plans).
5) Unless you remained outside the UK for the whole of 1995-96, you would
probably be regarded as resident and ordinarily resident in the UK for that
year, as well as for the years either side of it. Everything would then
depend upon the dual-residents' tiebreaking article: 2(1)(g)(ii).
You should find the text of the Singapore-UK double taxation agreement (as
amended) in volume 2 of the British International Tax Agreements, volume 6
of the British Tax Encyclopedia, Butterworths Tax Treaties, or volume F of
Simon's Taxes.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Number one flowerpot man -
Concentrating exclusively on up-market terracotta has taken Jim Keeling from
a 'dogsbodyship', to selling pots worth up to Pounds 750,000 a year. Clive
Fewins visits him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Keeling is Britain's number one flowerpot man. He has achieved this
remarkable position and a tenfold increase in turnover in the last decade by
developing an old-fashioned cottage industry.
In 1985, in an interview with the Financial Times, Keeling explained why he
did not intend to employ a sales staff nor to buy automated equipment to
beat off foreign competition. Far from being a business plan for extinction,
this strategy has enabled him to grow from an annual turnover of Pounds
75,000 in 1985 to Pounds 750,000 and to hold on to his gains through the
recession.
Keeling, the founder of Whichford pottery, is about the opposite of the
popular idea of a successful businessman. He is thoughtful and restrained -
a Catholic convert, who is greatly concerned that we should all be able to
realise our own 'inner journey'.
He is, however, undeniably Britain's leading maker of flower pots: he has
written two books on terracotta gardening.
His output ranges from the small terracotta flowerpots that graced every
potting shed before the age of plastics, to giant baroque urns adorned with
decorative fruits and acanthus leaves that cost up to Pounds 1,300 each.
In between comes a range of wallpots, Italianate jars, exotic ewers, pastry
pots, barrel-style pots, ornate troughs, animal figured pots, wallpots,
rhubarb forcers, strawberry barrels and a host of others.
They are all hand-thrown, and made from a blend of local clays mixed and
refined at the pottery.
It all started almost by accident. Shortly before going to Cambridge 22
years ago Keeling spent a summer reconstructing ceramics on an
archaeological dig in the Middle East. Then he gained what he calls a
'dogsbodyship' at a small pottery near Farnham in Surrey.
Keeling recalled: 'The buildings were falling down and I had no proper wage.
But I learned to throw and I specialised in plant pots from the word go. I
was taught to be very economical with materials and effort - that is how to
do it properly. Fortunately I have been able to pass on this throwing
tradition to nine others.
'The experience only lasted six months but it was a vital time. On my best
day I managed to throw 720 pots.'
In 1974 Keeling and his wife Dominique moved to Middle Barton in
Oxfordshire, where they bought a cottage for Pounds 15,000 with the help of
a Pounds 12,000 legacy and a small mortgage. Keeling then turned a nearby
barn he rented into a pottery. He financed this with a Pounds 5,000 bank
loan guaranteed by his father. He built a kiln from scrap metal and spares
and made little money out of potting for the first two years.
After three years the pottery was turning over Pounds 25,000, employing a
sales agent and training the first of several local young men, one of whom
is still with him, to be potters.
'I was working desperately hard, teaching myself to throw up to 60 15-inch
pots a day,' Keeling said.
He realised that if he could guarantee quality and continue to sell his pots
there was money in terracotta.
By the time the couple left Middle Barton in 1972 they had a turnover of
Pounds 36,000 (of which nearly 30 per cent was profit) a staff of three, and
a catalogue with 45 styles of pot.
Keeling took out a Pounds 30,000 mortgage to finance the move to a second
dilapidated cottage, eight miles away in Whichford, in the Warwickshire
Cotswolds.
There he resolved to stay with terracotta. 'I was fascinated by the basic
flower pot shape and was keen to produce as many variations as possible. I
also knew that by using terracotta I could make bigger profits than other
potters,' he said.
Three months later he was wondering if he had made the right move: 'I was
desperate to sell pots. The business was not known in its new surroundings
and I had a running battle with the planners over signs. I needed to sell a
lot more pots to finance expansion, yet found it increasingly difficult to
persuade the trade to buy from a small English producer.'
A friend suggested an exhibition in a warehouse in east London that was
available for weekend lets. Thanks to some national press coverage the
venture took Pounds 5,000 in the first three hours. The pottery's entire
stock went in two days.
'I was getting the full retail price by selling direct. The experience
opened my eyes and showed me the way forward was by direct selling,' Keeling
said. 'It also convinced me that there was a big future if I could increase
production.'
He took out a Pounds 40,000, 10-year loan from Lloyds bank, and set about
building a Pounds 33,000 pottery. He expanded his range and made strenuous
efforts to attract the attention of professional gardeners.
He steered away from garden centres and stores selling cheap imported
terracotta pots and pursued an unashamedly up-market policy.
'At Whichford I am keen to uphold the best manual working traditions,'
Keeling said. 'Here we have taken a good look at our hand-thrown tradition,
decided what works, and added to and improved on that.
In his 11 years at Whichford, Keeling has increasingly relied on advertising
and today more than half his sales are direct. Gardeners beat a path to the
pottery and he has expanded regional sales at country homes and nurseries.
Twenty per cent of his output is exported, about 20 per cent is sold to
garden centres, and the rest is sold by mail order.
Whichford Pottery holds a sale and 'open house' in the three weeks before
Christmas during which it disposes of a large number of seconds. This helps
to fill the gap at the time of year when production tends to fall below the
target of 1,000 pots a week.
'By and large we produce things we enjoy making. We also do a lot of
one-offs and adapt designs for grand gardens and the stately homes trade,'
Keeling said.
Turnover is likely to be down from the anticipated Pounds 750,000 this year
as Keeling has been developing new ideas and doing little throwing himself.
He is optimistic, however, that the company will show the Pounds 100,000
profit he likes to see at the end of each year.
He still owes Pounds 12,000 to the bank but, is in a good position to expand
if he chooses.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Offerings for investors tempted by
equities - A look at trusts being launched to meet the demand for stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong performance of the UK stock market last year and excitement at
the prospect of high levels of growth in the Far East have led to a spate of
new offerings from investment houses. With interest rates low, money has
been piling into equities.
Schroder and Gartmore investment trusts (see right) have both packaged their
new UK funds to appeal to the personal equity plan market in the run up to
the end of the tax year. Both are UK funds, the first focusing on growth and
the second on both income and growth. The other UK fund, Saracen, will
invest in smaller companies, while Edinburgh Fund Managers and Martin Currie
are looking for growth in the East. Newton's Distributor fund is an
international fund aimed at those seeking income.
Two of the funds are unit trusts, the rest are investment trusts. For unit
trusts, the launch period may be an attractive time to buy since discounts
are usually on offer. Martin Currie, for example, will knock one percentage
point off the initial charge for new buyers.
However, investors moving into an investment trust may be put off buying at
the launch, because they pay full price for shares which often start trading
at a discount. This is because of the costs of the issue. Many fund
management groups try to compensate for this by issuing free warrants with
parcels of shares.
A warrant gives you the right to buy shares in the trust or company on a
future date at a fixed price, often the original offer price. As the warrant
is usually exercised in the future, you would normally expect the share
price to have moved well above its issue price by then, so the warrant gives
you a very attractive buying opportunity.
Warrants can be sold separately from the shares, and their price rises as
the share price moves upwards. The value of the warrant after a while should
be enough to cancel out the discount on the ordinary shares.
For example, investors in the the Edinburgh New Tiger trust will receive one
warrant for every five shares they buy. These warrants have a 15-year life,
and the first exercise date is three or four years away. EFM hopes that the
price of the warrants when they start trading could account for about 7p a
share, compensating for a possible discount of 4p or so on the actual
shares. The Saracen Value Trust and Schroder UK Growth Fund will also be
issuing warrants on a one-for-five basis.
Split capital trusts aim to get around the same problem of the discount by
dividing up the share capital to form parcels that are attractive to
investors with particular needs, so that steady demand prevents the shares
from falling to a discount.
For example, the new Gartmore trust is aiming its ordinary income shares at
private investors wanting income, and using a Pep for tax shelter, while the
zero dividend shares may appeal more to institutional investors.
It may not seem a good time to enter the UK stock market, which performed
strongly towards the end of last year but Peter Sedgwick, chief executive of
Schroder Investment Management, believes that there is still more to come.
He says that the emphasis on income funds has left a gap in the market: 'Now
that yields on the UK market have fallen in anticipation of a recovery in
profits, the emphasis is switching to growth stocks.'
Edinburgh Fund Managers' New Tiger trust combines two of the popular
investment areas of the last few months: emerging markets and smaller
companies.
Although the fund will be invested in Asia, it will avoid the established
markets of Hong Kong and Singapore; other markets such as South Korea and
Taiwan may soon be excluded as too developed. New Tiger will be looking at
the smaller markets, such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, and only
using Hong Kong for its exposure to China, Vietnam, Laos etc.
South Asia is also on the menu - EFM has just bought a stake in an Indian
fund management group, so more investment there can be expected.
The launch has been timed for funds to be invested immediately after the
Chinese New Year in mid-February, traditionally a quiet time for south-east
Asian markets, with a chance of bargains to be had.
NEWTON
Name. Distributor Fund.
Aims. To achieve a total return of income and capital growth from a
portfolio of UK and international equities and to allow investors to draw on
capital to supplement income.
Yield. 3 per cent.
Minimum investment. Pounds 6,000
Charges. 6 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual.
Pepable? Yes, at no extra cost. Minimum Pep investment is Pounds 3,000.
Comment. The fund is aimed at income seekers who will be able to withdraw up
to 9 per cent annually. The withdrawal levels are 3 per cent, 5 per cent, 7
per cent and 9 per cent. The income can also be left to be reinvested. The
fund's aim is to replenish, in real terms, the capital withdrawn under the
terms of the plan but, of course, cannot guarantee this.
Newton is well-known for its Income fund which currently yields about 3.2
per cent and is top of its sector over seven years and five years, and third
over three years (to Jan 1, source: HSW).
The minimum investment and charges are relatively high.
See Serious Money, page II
GARTMORE
Name. British Income &amp; Growth Trust.
Aims. Investment in UK shares with a higher than average yield.
Terms. Ordinary income shares at 100p, zero dividend shares at 116p or
packaged units combining the two. Prices may change before offer opens on
February 15.
Yield. 9.3 per cent on the ordinary shares (in the form of income), 8 per
cent on the zeros (in the form of capital growth), and 4.4 per cent on the
packaged units.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000.
Charges. Issue expenses capped at 4 per cent; annual management fee 0.5 per
cent, except for Peps.
Pepable? Yes, for an initial charge of 1 per cent, and annual management
charge of 0.75 per cent.
Comment. This issue is timed so that investors can transfer shares into a
Pep on either side of the tax year-end, using one or both years' allowances.
But the yield on the trust is not over-generous: Gartmore's own Shared
Equity trust is higher. The fund needs to grow at 5 per cent a year if the
income shares are to be repaid with no loss of capital in 2002.
SARACEN
Name. Saracen Value Trust.
Aims. To invest in smaller companies (from the FT-SE SmallCap index), with
the aim of achieving long-term capital growth.
Yield. Similar to average smaller company yield.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000
Charges. Issue expenses capped at 3.5 per cent, with a 1 per cent annual
management charge.
Terms. Ordinary shares at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares. Offer opens: February 10.
Pepable? Yes, independently.
Comment. As Saracen Fund Managers is a new outfit, and this is their first
trust, there is no track record to check. But James Fisher, the main manager
of this fund, was previously a fund manager at Scottish Amicable, in charge
of Pounds 1bn of funds, mostly invested in smaller companies. Smaller
companies are a popular investment area at the current stage of the economic
cycle. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index rose by about 39 per cent
last year (more than the FT-SE), and if the recovery gathers pace, there
should be more growth to come.
SCHRODER
Name. UK Growth
Aims. To achieve high capital growth through investing in UK equities.
Yield. In line with the FT-A All-Share.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000
Charges. The annual management charge will be 0.75 per cent; issue expenses
capped at 4.5 per cent.
Terms. Shares are on offer at 100p, with warrants attached on a one-for-five
basis.
Pepable? Yes, for an annual fee of 0.5 per cent on top of the 0.75 per cent
annual management charge on the trust and an initial charge of 5.25 per
cent. Minimum investment in the Pep is Pounds 3,000.
Special terms. The initial Pep charge is waived during the launch period
planned for February 9-March 2. Those investing solely in the Pep will
receive free warrants during the launch.
Comment. Schroder already has a successful UK growth unit trust and the
investment trusts will be managed by the same team. The UK Enterprise trust,
launched in 1988, is second in its sector in the five years to January 1 and
fourth in the three years to January 1, according to Micropal.
EFM
Name. Edinburgh New Tiger.
Aims. Long term capital growth by investing in quoted smaller companies in
emerging Asian countries.
Yield. Zero.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000 (monthly savings scheme to be launched
later).
Charges. Issue expenses capped at 4 per cent. Annual management fee 1.2 per
cent.
Terms. Ordinary shares offered at 50p, with one free warrant attached to
every five shares. Offer period January 29 to February 18.
Pepable? No.
Comment. This trust's target area - which includes India and China - is home
to more than half the world's population, and is developing rapidly. Its
economies are growing at an average of more than 6 per cent a year. Smaller
companies have so far escaped the close attention of international
investors, so their shares are not yet overvalued. These are volatile
markets, and the ride could be very rough at times, but investors taking a
long-term view should be rewarded. The same team is already responsible for
the successful EFM Dragon trust.
MARTIN CURRIE
Name. Asian Opportunities.
Aims. To achieve capital growth through investment in Asian markets
(excluding Japan and Australasia).
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000
Charges. 6 per cent initial; 1.25 annual management fee.
Special terms. Initial charge reduced to 5 per cent during the launch period
scheduled for February 14-28.
Pepable? Yes, at no extra cost but only qualifies for a maximum Pep
investment of Pounds 1,500, since more than 50 per cent of the investment is
outside the EC.
Comment. Martin Currie says the fund will complete its Far East range which
comprise a Japan fund and a Far East including Japan fund. It launched an
offshore Indian Opportunities fund last year and has an Emerging Markets
fund. Its International Growth fund has a good track record and came second
in its sector in the 10 years to January 1, according to HSW.
The markets of Asia are volatile but Martin Currie hopes that since the new
fund will have a broad spread of investments from China to the Middle East,
risk will be lessened.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
December. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the
month in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your
sale, and the balance will be your taxable gain or loss*.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold
them in December 1993 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by
the September 1985 figure of 1.487 gives a total of Pounds 8,922.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 4,078,
which is within the 1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares
bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The Retail
Price Index in December was 141.9.
*For shares sold on or after November 30 1993, it is no longer possible to
use indexation to create, or to increase, a loss.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: A rival stock exchange - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a a 1950s TV western series The Cisco Kid, the Kid and his partner,
Pancho, 'fought for justice' in New Mexico.
Another Cisco is currently fighting for justice but this time for small
companies in the UK. The City Group for Smaller Companies has chosen 'Cisco'
as its abbreviated name.
The group includes stockbrokers, venture capitalists, merchant bankers, and
others who believe that a new exchange should be created to trade in the
shares of small companies.
This new exchange could be run by the London Stock Exchange or by an
independent organisation. Will there be a shoot-out in the City?
The London Stock Exchange has already announced its intention to close the
Unlisted Securities Market 'following an extensive review which concluded
that the market's distinct identity had been eroded since 1990 by
convergence in the regulations and cost of joining the Official List and the
USM.' It is investigating a possible replacement for the USM and has
commissioned a market research survey, the results of which should be known
in March.
Meanwhile, Cisco is looking into ways of organising and financing an
independent, smaller companies exchange. It too, expects to produce its
findings in March.
As a private investor, I would like to see a strong, independent rival to
the London Stock Exchange. But I feels it would be a mistake to saddle it
with a name such as 'The Enterprise Market'. This seems to be the choice
adopted by both parties investigating the need for it.
To me, such a name implies that the market will be solely aimed at new
enterprises carrying much more risk than other companies. It makes it seem
like a junior market from which companies would feel they have to graduate
to a full listing.
If the new market is used by private investors as very high risk - or, even
worse, as a dumping ground for shares which institutional investors might
otherwise have difficulty in getting rid of - then it will have no hope of
emulating the US-based Nasdaq.
Founded in 1971 to cater for small companies, Nasdaq has rapidly grown to
become the world's second largest stock market in terms of volumes traded.
Companies such as Intel, Apple and Microsoft, which all started on Nasdaq,
have not felt the need to 'graduate' to Wall Street. Nasdaq is recognised as
a fully-fledged exchange. Indeed, more overseas companies list their
American Depository Receipts on Nasdaq than on any other US exchange.
When Nasdaq started, it was able to offer something different: fast and
efficient electronic share dealing. A new exchange in the UK would not have
such a unique selling point because the London Stock Exchange took advantage
of Big Bang to follow Nasdaq's example.
What, then, could a new UK exchange offer to make it attractive to investors
and ensure its financial viability?
It could charge much lower fees to companies seeking a stock market listing
but it would still need to ensure that not too many crooks found their way
in. It would have to organise a proper regulatory system.
A new exchange could have much longer trading hours than the London Stock
Market. But one of the most attractive selling points could be in settlement
systems.
With the traumas of Taurus and Crest and having to cope with all manner of
vested interests, the London Stock Exchange suffers in ways which ought not
to afflict a completely new exchange.
All companies quoted on the new market should use a depository system
whereby a company - vetted and monitored by the Bank of England - would hold
share and bond certificates on behalf of the beneficial owners. The shares
would not be registered in 'marking name' (nominees) but in the actual names
of the investors concerned. Any investor who wanted a share certificate
could get one printed out free by the depository company.
The new exchange (and the depository company) should offer much better
compensation schemes than are currently available from existing
organisations. This would demonstrate to investors that the new market was
fully aware of its obligations to provide an honest and efficient service -
since automatic compensation would be paid, not only for any losses due to
fraud, but also as a result of any hiccups in the system - in much the same
way as many utility companies now make payments if they fail to achieve
certain specified time targets.
New legislation should be introduced to give the new exchange a kick-start.
There are a number of companies which are reluctant to gain a full stock
market quotation because of the tax situation of current shareholders. The
same rules regarding inheritance tax relief and roll-over relief on unquoted
and certain other companies should be extended to cover companies quoted on
the new exchange.
It also seems unfair that a company with a limited track record can come to
a market in a blaze of publicity and promote the offer price for its shares
while a company that already has a market listing (and a good track record)
is unable to advertise that its shares are a bargain at current prices.
Companies quoted on the new exchange should be allowed, within reasonable
restrictions, to promote their own shares.
The new market should also adopt a very high profile and engage in all
manner of educational and promotional activities - from direct mail shots to
TV advertisements to promote its activities and encourage people to invest
in the companies traded on the exchange.
The new exchange might then not only improve the current lack of liquidity
in the small companies sector but stand a reasonable chance of further
expansion and giving investors the opportunity to benefit from the results
of genuine competition.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Yes, you can defer CGT - Caroline
Garnham is cheered by reinvestment relief on gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Details of a way of deferring payment of capital gains tax, published in the
Finance Bill last week, really are as good as expected.
The reinvestment relief for CGT operates to relieve all gains no matter how
they are made, provided the gain is reinvested in the shares of an unquoted
trading company, whether your own or a family company, or a company run by a
complete stranger.
The relief may not appeal to everyone, since unquoted trading company shares
are regarded as inherently risky. However, there are circumstances,
particularly within entrepreneurial families, where this relief could be a
way of postponing payment of the tax indefinitely.
To give you an idea of how it can be made to work, take for example Mr
James:
Mr James sold his retail business five years ago. He reinvested part of the
proceeds - Pounds 700,000 - in the freehold of a shopping centre which has
since increased in value (after inflation) by Pounds 200,000.
His daughter, Jennifer, has a pre-packaged food business which she runs
through an unquoted private company. The company needs additional finance to
expand and Mr James is willing to assist, especially if he can sell his
interest in the shopping centre and avoid an immediate charge to tax on the
Pounds 200,000 gain.
Provided Mr James invests at least Pounds 200,000 (that is, the gain on the
sale of the shopping centre) in ordinary unquoted shares of his daughter's
company, his gain on the shopping centre can be deferred until the sale (or
gift) of the shares in his daughter's company.
Let us further assume that since the sale of Mr James' retail business, he
has been a full-time working director of his daughter's company. Let us also
assume that he invests Pounds 250,000 in his daughter's company, which is 30
per cent of the ordinary share capital. His investment in Jennifer's company
will now also start to qualify for retirement relief.
Assuming Mr James works full-time for the company for a further five years
before selling his 30 per cent stake for Pounds 400,000, not only would the
gain of Pounds 150,000 attract 100 per cent relief, but in addition the
Pounds 200,000 gain rolled over from the sale of the shopping centre would
also attract retirement relief (on the first Pounds 100,000 at 100 per cent
and the remaining Pounds 50,000 at 50 per cent at current retirement relief
rates).
Alternatively, let us suppose that Mr James is in poor health and has not
worked for the company. He would like to sell his shopping centre to help
his daughter but is reluctant to do so for fear of incurring a high CGT
charge which would be avoided if he kept the shopping centre until his
death.
With this new relief, Mr James should be able to avoid not only the CGT
charge, but inheritance tax as well.
If Mr James were to sell his shopping centre and reinvest Pounds 250,000 to
take a 30 per cent stake in Jennifer's business, on his death all gains,
including the rollover gain on the shopping centre, will be exempt and the
shares in Jennifer's company should qualify for business property relief and
be totally exempt from IHT as well.
Mr James need not necessarily become involved in the decision-making process
of Jennifer's company. It is possible for him to gift his shares in
Jennifer's company into a trust for himself and appoint Jennifer as a
Trustee. Jennifer will then remain in full control of the decisions
affecting the company and, assuming Mr James can claim relief for gifts of
business assets, putting the shares into a trust will not give rise to an
immediate charge, nor will it affect his eligibility for full CGT relief and
IHT relief on death.
The new reinvestment relief is not limited to sales. For example, if Mr
James gave his freehold interest in the shopping centre to his son Paul,
say, as a wedding gift, the tax on the gain (as calculated against market
value) could still be avoided, provided Mr James invests a sum equivalent to
the chargeable gain made on his shopping centre in unquoted private company
shares such as in Jennifer's company.
Of course, as with all reliefs where the gain is deferred, if the company
and shares do not qualify and continue to qualify then the tax becomes
payable immediately.
As you would expect, there are a number of irritating conditions which must
be satisfied before the relief is available. One of these is that if the
company holds more than half of its chargeable assets in land, it will fail
to qualify. There are provisions which permit the reduction of the value of
land by securing debts against it.
Therefore, if your land is relatively too high in value, the company could
raise money using the land as security. In addition, or alternatively, it
could invest in chargeable assets and thereby reduce the company's interest
in land to less than half. In addition, you must continue to monitor the
chargeable assets of the company to make sure that over the years, the value
of the land does not increase beyond the value of the company's other
chargeable assets and thereby disqualify the company.
If this were to happen, all is not lost. Provided you invest more money (up
to the value of the held-over gain) in other unquoted shares within the time
limits, the held-over gain will not become chargeable.
The new reinvestment relief is a useful addition to the other reliefs
already available. Unfortunately,there is little harmonisation between the
reliefs. To qualify for the 100 per cent IHT business property relief you
must hold 25 per cent or more of ordinary shares, whether they are quoted or
unquoted; for retirement relief you need to hold at least 5 per cent of
unquoted qualifying shares; and, for reinvestment relief, the relief is
available no matter what your holding is, provided your shares are unquoted
qualifying shares.
If you give business assets (and claim relief for gifts of business assets),
you will not be liable for the tax but the person to whom you give the
assets will be, although only when they dispose of them. However, if you
sell assets and reinvest the proceeds in unquoted trading company shares
(and claim reinvestment relief), you would still be liable for the tax on
the gain but it will be deferred until you dispose of them.
Avoid do-it-yourself tax mitigation schemes because of the complexity
created through the legislation.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pep bombardment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors will be bombarded with mailshots and advertising campaigns in the
coming months, to tempt them into a personal equity plan before the tax year
ends on April 5.
All income and gains made within a Pep are tax-free and this has made them
enormously popular. Over Pounds 9.2bn has been invested in general Peps,
which were first sold in 1987 and into which Pounds 6,000 a year can be
invested.
Since 1992, an additional Pounds 3,000 can be put in a single-company Pep.
There are more than 870 schemes to choose from, so investors do not lack for
choice. Chase de Vere, which published its annual Pep guide this week, also
includes performance figures for unit, investment trust and single company
Peps.
The top performer among the unit and investment trusts over three years is
Hill Samuel's UK Emerging Companies unit trusts with growth of 185 per cent
(figures are offer-to-offer, so the initial charges are not taken into
account, with gross income reinvested). The fund was launched in 1989 to
invest in companies with a maximum market capitalisation of Pounds 50m.
Personal Assets - managed by Ivory &amp; Sime - and Law Debenture, both
investment trusts, were next, growing by 179 per cent and 171 per cent
respectively. The first invests in the UK and the US, while Law Debenture,
which is managed by Henderson TR, has a broad international spread.
The remaining funds in the top 10, in decreasing order of performance, were
St James' Place Pep Progressive unit trust, Henderson TR Electric &amp; General
IT, Glasgow Shires IT, Perpetual High Income unit trust, Fleming Fledgling
IT, the ordinary shares of Finsbury Smaller Companies IT and Pembroke unit
trust.
The Pep with the weakest performance was Equitable Special Situations which
grew by 20 per cent over the period.
The Pep leaders of the FT-SE 100 companies over one year were British
Aerospace (with growth of 283 per cent), Powergen, Granada Group, Royal Bank
of Scotland, Standard Chartered, British Steel, Blue Circle, Great Universal
Stores, RMC Group and Schroders.
Single company Peps are often used to transfer shares acquired under an
employee share option schemes. Only one company's shares can be held at any
time, but it is possible to switch between them.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Check your pension options - Expert
advice is needed to prevent short-term gain becoming long-term expense /
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign assignments are viewed by many employees as a lucrative and exciting
perk but the short-term financial gains can be undermined by long-term
damage to your pension.
It is wise to seek expert advice to check the value and security of pension
arrangements because there is no UK standard expatriate pension package.
There are several options to consider - remaining in the UK scheme, setting
up an offshore arrangement, or joining the local scheme in the country of
assignment. Helen Cox, partner with international law firm Clifford Chance,
said: 'Whatever arrangement you settle for, it is important to check that
you are not losing out in terms of the continuity and level of your pension
benefits. In some expatriate contracts, employers guarantee that you will be
no worse off as a result of your secondment than if you had stayed in the UK
in the main company scheme.'
Remain in UK company scheme
Under UK law it is possible to remain in the company scheme for up to 10
years provided your employer meets qualifying rules, although you might hit
a three-year time limit if your company is a UK subsidiary of a foreign one.
Brian Waite, international consultant with actuaries William M Mercer, says:
'Most employees going abroad for a single assignment for, say, three or five
years, prefer to stay in their UK company pension scheme if they think they
are going to return to the UK at the end of the assignment. All their
benefits will then come from one source in one currency, and they do not
have to chase around trying to track down benefits from overseas employers
when they come to retire in 30 years.'
Taxation is the main stumbling block in any expatriate pension package and
retention in the UK scheme is no exception. Most schemes in Europe, for
example, work on the principle of tax deferment and so, although they allow
tax relief on contributions, the pension itself is taxed (with some
exceptions such as the tax-free cash lump sum on retirement in the UK).
Clearly, employees who claim relief on contributions in one country but pay
tax on the pension in another, upset the fiscal balance. As a result many
foreign tax authorities will treat an expatriate's pension contributions
paid by the UK employer to the UK scheme as extra income and will tax them
accordingly.
The EU is struggling to create a more equitable and flexible system to allow
expatriate workers to remain in their home country scheme and retain all the
tax reliefs, but progress is slow and in the meantime exiles should check
carefully how their pension contributions will be treated for tax purposes
in the country of assignment.
Unfunded promise
It is not the pension promise that causes difficulties but the funding of
that promise. For this reason some employers offer an 'unfunded promise'
where the usual pension benefits are provided during the secondment but
there is no fund to back that guarantee.
In spite of their apparent simplicity, there are significant risks
associated with unfunded promises. For example, how safe would your pension
be if the company went into liquidation or was taken over by a hostile
predator? What would happen if you left to work for a rival company and
tried to take a transfer of pension benefits? Where there is no specific
fund earmarked for the pension covering the period of secondment this could
prove very difficult.
Offshore trusts
Offshore pension trusts can be an effective and tax-efficient way of
providing pension benefits for senior executives, particularly if their
career makes it impossible for them to remain within the UK company scheme.
The trust, often sited in the Channel Islands, can be designed to provide
higher benefits and earlier retirement than the main UK company scheme.
Where the employee plans to retire abroad the trust can be set up to pay
benefits in different currencies.
Offshore trusts are complex and must be arranged by a reputable firm of
benefits consultants and legal experts and should be backed by
documentation.
Other options
If the job abroad is for a foreign employer, it is worth looking at the
local company pension scheme. In some cases, membership of the company
pension scheme may be a condition of employment.
If you join a foreign scheme, you should qualify for employer contributions
and all the tax reliefs associated with locally-approved pension
arrangements. The downside is that because of different minimum qualifying
periods, you may have to work for several years before you have the right to
any pension at all. Furthermore, it may be difficult to transfer your
benefits out of the country if you leave.
Other alternatives include a local individual private pension plan, if this
type of product is available, or an offshore plan. Beware of offshore plans
sold by insurance companies. Charges and commissions may be very high and
the contract may lock you into a fixed period of contribution. If your
secondment is cut short and you return to the UK you could face punitive
early termination penalties.
State pensions
State pensions are funded through national insurance contributions.
Normally, when you work abroad for more than a year, you will leave the UK
social security scheme and pay into the local system. While UK pensions are
meagre, in most European countries they are more substantial.
A pan-European Union system allows you to aggregate the number of years you
have paid national insurance contributions in different EU countries in
order to meet the various minimum qualifying periods that apply. However,
when planning for retirement, it is important to remember that the age at
which you can claim the state pension varies from 60 to 67 depending on the
country of source.
Next week: retiring abroad.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market soars to unexploded heights and we wait to see what directors
will do. Some do nothing much, some sell a little to take profits, others
continue to deal for personal financial planning reasons.
Nobo Group produces office equipment. In the second week of January, the
company announced interim results strongly ahead of the same period last
year. The share price has moved up on the back of it so the sale of 200,000
shares each by Peter Kent, the non-executive chairman, and Reginald Barr,
the chief executive, is not surprising. Each director retains considerable
quantities of stock. Sales should aid market liquidity.
Thomas French &amp; Sons, the home decoration company, appears in both the sale
and buy columns. Final results were announced at the beginning of January
and M Snapes was appointed as a new chief executive. He then bought 100,000
shares. The chairman and erstwhile managing director, Thomas French, sold
100,000 shares to Snapes and sold the other 250,000 shares for a beneficial
trust.
A Beckman Plc is involved in both textile converting and merchanting and
property investment. Melvin Lawson, an executive director bought 120,000
shares for 55p, increasing his holding to over 900,000.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Trouble on two wheels - All bikes
are becoming harder to insure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four wheels are good, but two wheels can be better, especially in city
traffic jams. More and more people are taking to motorcycles and bicycles to
get to work or get around. But thieves are also keen on bikes: they are left
in the open for hours at a time, are easy to sell for a quick profit, and
provide built-in getaway transport. The fashion for expensive mountain bikes
and lots of accessories has added to the temptation.
BICYCLES
Finding an insurer to cover your bicycle for an affordable price is becoming
increasingly difficult, particularly if you live in one of the cycle crime
blackspots. London, Bristol, Oxford and Cambridge are among the areas where
insurers are no longer enthusiastic about providing cover.
'Bristol for some reason is almost a Bermuda triangle for cycles,' says
Elaine Court, of AUA Insurance in Norwich, one of the few remaining insurers
with a stand-alone bicycle policy. It no longer covers cycles in central
Bristol, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Southall, or anywhere with a London
postcode. Residents of other areas are divided into three premium
categories. So a bike worth between Pounds 350 and Pounds 400, owned by
someone living in a rural area, would cost Pounds 37.50 a year to insure,
while a person living in Croydon would pay Pounds 56.25 to cover the same
bike. Children and students are excluded.
Students have a tough time getting insurance from most specialists: their
claim levels are twice as high as normal, according to West Mercia Insurance
Services, of Wombourne, near Wolverhampton. It will not cover students aged
18-25, although its partner firm, Harrison Beaumont, will cover cycles as
part of a student possessions insurance policy. The other possibility for
students is to get their parents' home contents insurer to extend cover to
their term-time address.
One firm which used to specialise in cycle insurance is almost giving up.
Graham Brown Insurance Brokers will not be taking on new cycle business
because of unexpectedly high levels of claims, although existing customers
will still be covered.
Some of the cycling organisations, such as the Cyclists Touring Club, in
Godalming, Surrey, and the London Cycling Campaign, still have insurance
schemes for their members, though it is becoming more difficult to get such
schemes underwritten. The CTC also offers travel cover for cyclists touring
abroad.
Theft or damage are not the only problems faced by cyclists. If you cause an
accident with a car, or hit a pedestrian, they could sue you for damages.
Most cycle insurance policies cover legal liability, but personal accident
cover (for any injuries you suffer) is usually extra.
Security is a consideration. The invincible cycle lock is yet to be
invented, but insurers will not be sympathetic if you use only a flimsy
chain. Some will not cover you for leaving your bike outside all night, or
if you leave it chained up outside work all day. Make sure your pattern of
use is covered before buying a policy.
The majority of cyclists opt for cover under their home contents insurance,
which can work out cheaper than a specialist policy. For example, General
Accident's main home policy covers bikes worth up to Pounds 200. After that
they have to be specified, and an additional premium paid, ranging from
Pounds 3.20 to Pounds 5 per Pounds 100, depending on the area. Many insurers
impose a limit on the value of bikes they will insure, often somewhere
between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000. Home contents policies often include an
element of personal liability cover as well - check that yours does.
But be warned: your cycle is probably your highest-risk possession, and a
string of claims will put a black mark on your insurance record. It could
cost you more than the cycles were worth. Your premiums may rocket, or you
may have to accept a high excess, and if you try to change insurers, you may
be turned down.
The alternative is to follow Lord Justice Scott's example - buy a cheap
undistinguished bicycle and do not insure it. Even if you have to replace it
every year or two, it could work out cheaper overall, particularly as an old
rust-heap is less likely to be stolen than snazzier modern models.
MOTORCYCLES
Motorcyclists have also seen premiums rise steeply in recent years. Norwich
Union, which has the largest share of the motorcycle insurance market,
stopped covering younger bikers a few years ago because claim levels were so
high. Now it has introduced a new rating system which it hopes will make
premiums better matched to risks, and has started offering comprehensive
cover for the under-28s again.
Traditionally, motorcycles were rated on a combination of rider's age,
address and size of engine. The exact model or value of the motorcycle was
not taken into consideration. With modern motorcycles, however, there can be
large differences in performance, value and expense of repairs between
models with the same engine capacity.
Norwich's new Premier Bike policy assigns motorcycles to one of 17 groups,
in the same way that cars are underwritten, depending on the model, its
price and so on. It also pays attention to the driver's age and address.
Allen Burton, of the Birmingham-based Motorcycle Action Group, says even
this rating system may not give a true reflection of risks. For example,
Burton says age is not an accurate guide to accident risk: experience is
more important. Many weekend bikers in their 30s and 40s, may have less
experience than a 20-year-old, and so are more likely to crash.
MAG introduced an insurance scheme for its members six months ago, and has
been able to negotiate lower premiums, as MAG members are likely to be more
experienced than average. The premiums depend on experience, and the model
of motorcycle, taking into account its value and attractiveness to thieves,
and also how expensive it is to repair.
Traditional-style motorcycles such as Harley Davidsons can be cheaper to
repair than many modern Japanese motorcycles, unless they are vintage models
for which parts are difficult to find. Streamlined modern motorcycles often
have 'fairings' - plastic or fibreglass shells around the front wheel and
handlebars - which can crack in even minor accidents, and have to be
replaced whole, at a cost of about Pounds 1,000, Burton says. A Harley might
only sustain a minor dent in the same circumstances. However, Harleys are
highly attractive to criminals, so their overall premium rate is still high.

<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott has been an enthusiastic cyclist for 'between 25 and 30
years', writes Jimmy Burns.
He has never had an accident and never been insured. His first bike was
second hand. He never chained it up and it was eventually stolen. For the
last 20 years he has been on a slightly newer bike. 'I bought it for about
for Pounds 80 - it was the cheapest in the shop. This time I invested in a
padlock and chain.' Why no insurance for a judge who bicycles to his inquiry
every morning? 'I've never really considered it. It is not clear that it is
cost effective.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's annual results for the year to September 30 are the first it has
published since Dieter Bock its German joint chief executive, started the
process of making the international trading group a 'more normal company.'
Last autumn, he succeeded in having non-executives appointed to the board
for the first time in 20 years and in setting up an audit committee to
review auditing procedures and financial performance.
The figures will therefore be of particular interest to see if the audit
committee's influence is apparent - and whether the company statement
contains any telltale signs of the state of the battle between Bock and his
fellow joint chief executive, Tiny Rowland.
Analysts believe that profits from ongoing businesses doubled last year to
around Pounds 80m and that the figure including gains from disposals could
be as high as Pounds 140m.
John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group, is expected to
announce on Monday increased profits for the six months to October from
Pounds 3.8m to between Pounds 4.1m and Pounds 5m.
WH Smith reports on Wednesday, and profits are expected to be up from Pounds
40.2m to between Pounds 42m and Pounds 46m for the six months to November.
Sales increases for the first half may be flattered somewhat by weak
comparatives from the year before, with the second half comparatives getting
more difficult.
Thursday sees interim results from furniture retailer MFI, with analysts'
uncertainty about its performance reflected by the wide spread of forecasts
centring on about Pounds 22.5m-Pounds 23m - up from Pounds 12.7m last year -
excluding the profit on MFI's sale of shares in Carpetright. Its comments on
the January sale period will attract particular attention.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts overshadow the performance of
Pibs - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reviews of 1993 reported the strong performance from gilts but few mentioned
the strength of other sterling bonds.
For instance, total returns from permanent interest bearings shares - fixed
interest-paying instruments issued by building societies - ranged from 35
per cent for Halifax 12 per cent, to 46 per cent from Bristol &amp; West 13.375
per cent. Of the 46 per cent gain, 34 per cent was tax-free capital gain and
12.4 per cent was the gross amount of income.
Predicting the future value or direction of your capital is pure speculation
and one rarely recommends Pibs for capital growth. Therefore, the 1993
capital gain should be regarded as a bonus which will almost certainly not
be repeated in 1994.
However, one certainty is that investors who bought the Pibs with a 12.4 per
cent income yield will receive the same in 1994 as in 1993, and 1995, and so
on. Investors in most types of bonds (but not in Pibs, which will normally
never be repaid) know from the outset when, and how much, the bonds will be
worth at the maturity date.
That is why institutions hold large bond portfolios within life, pensions
and other investment funds. Last year saw record sterling bond issues of
Pounds 22.6bn in addition to Pounds 60bn of new gilt issues.
We recommend bonds for financial planning and to form the core of most
portfolios to which equities can be added.
You can buy bonds through a broker or authorised adviser. Market forces will
determine the capital value, except upon maturity, which will be what was
promised at the time of purchase. In the meantime you receive interest
payments from the issuer.
When you buy the bond, you need to be certain that you know for how long you
wish to hold it, how much you want to receive back, and the income that will
be paid in the meantime.
You must also believe the issuer can afford to keep its promise (remember
that unlike dividend payments which can be reduced or omitted at the
discretion of the board, bond interest is a contractual obligation and
failure to pay could force a company into liquidation).
Finally, the bond markets are always developing. Last week saw the
re-emergence of the once large corporations sector.
Investors buying the new corporation issues have been achieving attracting
yields of 65 basis points above comparable gilts, but they are not
specifically guaranteed by the government.
Michael Dyson is a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets. This
is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients directly. Readers
interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: A bond designed for pensioners - A
look at the pros and cons of the latest National Savings product designed
specifically for the over-65s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Far Side cartoon advertising the Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond from
National Savings shows animals waiting in pairs to go into the ark to escape
the flood, and has a caption promising a guaranteed income, come rain or
shine.
What looks appealing as storm clouds gather can, however, seem rather less
so if the weather changes.
At present, the bond's combination of features seems attractive. The 7 per
cent gross interest rate, fixed for five years and paid monthly on a minimum
of only Pounds 500 is a mix not available elsewhere in the market. The
maximum investment is Pounds 20,000.
The government announced the bond in the Budget specifically in order to
help pensioners of 65 and over because so many had seen incomes drop as a
result of falling interest rates.
At the same time, it did not want to lock investors irreversibly into an
interest rate that might be generous now but could trap them if rates rose
sharply.
The solution is the two-month withdrawal period. Investors can withdraw
money from the bond, provided they give 60-days notice and suffer the loss
of 60 days interest.
Launching the bond, Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, said that
he believed this feature was as important as the interest rate itself. It
would enable people to move if they wanted to do so, but would not unfairly
give them 'a one-way bet'.
Knowing that you will not inevitably be left behind if the market moves on
clearly makes the prospect more tempting.
The drawback is that to make the most of this flexibility requires quite
sophisticated judgments about the speed and scale of interest rate
movements.
For those who use the monthly interest to supplement their incomes - some of
those in mind when the bond was designed - the loss of two months' payments
may also be a significant disincentive to shifting their investment, even if
interest rates have risen.
All investors will automatically be paid their interest gross (on the 19th
of the month) and so people who do not pay tax will not have to go through
the process of reclaiming it.
If an investor dies before the five-year term is completed, there is no
financial penalty. The bond can either be transferred to someone else of
eligible age, or can be realised.
Other products available do, however, match or better individual aspects of
the bond, and are not restricted to a particular age range.
The National Savings capital bond series H, for example, offers 7.25 per
cent compound interest guaranteed for five years from a minimum of Pounds
100. Like the Pensioners bond, interest is taxable but is paid gross.
However, the interest is only paid on maturity and no interest at all is
available if the bond is repaid within the first year.
Some banks and building societies offer monthly interest on fixed-rate five
year bonds, but none of these starts as low as Pounds 500, and none offers
as much as 7 per cent gross. The range is broadly between 5-6 per cent.
National &amp; Provincial building society's escalator bond, which guarantees
that the rate will rise over the term, does have a minimum of just Pounds
500.
For that minimum, the rate rises from 4 per cent in the first year to 6 per
cent in the fifth year if interest is paid monthly, and is 0.5 percentage
points higher throughout if the interest is paid yearly. But the penalty for
early repayment is loss of 180 days' interest.
Another product comparable with the pensioners' bond are Tessas (tax exempt
special savings accounts). Most pay interest annually but some will do so on
a monthly basis. According to Moneyfacts, Coventry building society offers a
monthly income Tessa at 6.75 per cent on Pounds 1 upwards, while Stroud &amp;
Swindon building society offers the same rate on a minimum of Pounds 3,000.
Both offer 7 per cent if interest is paid annually.
These interest rates are variable, but the fact that the products are
tax-free could mean that for some people they offer a better real rate of
return, at least for the moment.
The pensioners' bond went on sale yesterday. People can call for a
prospectus and application form using a free 24-hour a day telephone line
(0500-500000) or can fill in the coupon attached to the advertisement in the
press. If you apply using the coupon, you have a 28-day cooling off period
in which to change your mind.
Application forms will be available in post offices from 10 February.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: If the price is right the choice is
big - There are more types of mortgage on offer than ever. Scheherazade
Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton consider their infinite variety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
Many prospective house buyers have been biding their time until the market
bottomed out, but estate agents and would-be sellers are now hoping that
recent rises in house price indices will flush buyers into the open.
If you are one, and particularly if you are a new buyer, the choice of
mortgage may be greater than ever before. There are traditional variable
rate loans and many fixed-rate mortgages are available.
In addition, some lenders have introduced mortgage packages to help
borrowers pay off mortgages more quickly than the usual 25-year term.
How to pay back the mortgage
The choice may at first seem overwhelming, but all mortgages fall into two
basic types: repayment or interest-only. This division is created because
any loan comprises two parts: the original capital borrowed and the
interest.
Repayment mortgages
Your monthly repayments cover both the interest and capital so that at the
end of the traditional 25-year term, the whole loan has been paid off. The
main virtue of this type of mortgage is its simplicity. As long as you
maintain monthly commitments, the loan is guaranteed to be paid off at the
end of the term.
The main drawback is that each time you move, you have to redeem the
mortgage and start from scratch with another loan. Since you will usually be
paying more in interest than capital in the early years of the mortgage, you
could find that your payments are mostly of interest if you move frequently.
It can be argued that although repayment mortgages are safe, interest-only
loans are better because the borrower can invest the portion which would
otherwise go towards paying off the capital, giving him the opportunity to
make money over and above the original loan.
Interest-only mortgages
As the name suggests, your monthly contribution only covers the interest on
the original sum borrowed. At the end of the 25-years, the onus is on you to
pay off the capital in one go. This method obviously has its attractions at
times of relatively high inflation. In 1969, the average house cost Pounds
4,640, an amount which seems enviably small today.
Neverthless, you cannot leave everything to inflation, particularly in times
of low inflation. The mortgage savings packages suggested by lenders are all
equity-linked - an endowment, a pension, or a personal equity plan.
Endowment mortgages still account for most new mortgages, although they have
fallen from their 1988 peak. Their popularity is due in no small part to
firm recommendation by banks and building societies, who earn commission on
their sale.
Your monthly payments consist of the interest to the building society and a
premium to an insurance company, which invests the money on your behalf and
also throws in some life assurance.
Mortgage-linked endowments are usually for a fixed 25-year term. You need to
continue them to maturity to get the full benefit, so once you have one, you
carry it with you each time you move, although the underlying mortgage may
be switched to a different lender (see below).
Pension and personal equity plan-linked mortgages occupy the 'niche' end of
the market and are both highly tax-efficient.
However, many do not like the idea of using some of their pension savings to
pay off their mortgage. Pension mortgages are also inflexible because the
benefits cannot be taken until retirement age. This can mean making interest
payments for more than 25 years if you are a young borrower, which is a
needlessly expensive procedure.
Peps allow you to invest up to Pounds 9,000 annually in the stock market
with income and capital gains free of tax. However, you are at the mercy of
stock market fluctuations.
Some lenders, notably Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, will allow
you to take out an interest-only loan without linking it to a specific
product and leave it up to you to decide how to invest to repay the capital
sum.
Fixed rates
With mortgage and interest rates at 20-year lows, people have been rushing
to fix their interest payments. The most recent Council of Mortgage Lender
figures for the third quarter of 1993, show that 61 per cent of new
mortgages taken out were fixed rate, compared to 27 per cent just one year
earlier.
The costs of a fixed rate mortgage include paying a booking or
administration fee of Pounds 200-Pounds 300. Try to avoid fixed rates tied
to insurance-related products. And there will be early redemption penalties
 -the fee for early repayment of part or all of the loan.
Choosing a short-term fix of, say, three years or less, leaves you exposed
to the risk that the fix ends just as interest rates rise again. But
fixed-rate offers of more than five years are likely to be higher than the
standard variable rate of 7.64-7.74 per cent.
Reducing the burden
Stepping up repayments
If you are lucky enough to find monthly repayments easily affordable now
that interest rates are low, you will save on interest if you reduce the
size of your original borrowing.
This option becomes more attractive as monthly payments become more
expensive. Mortgage interest tax relief will be restricted to 20 per cent
(from 25 per cent) in the 1994-95 tax year and to 15 per cent the following
tax year (see table). Miras remains capped on the first Pounds 30,000 of the
loan.
You should talk to your lender about the best way of making lump sum
repayments. In most cases, you will need to state that the money is for
repaying the capital and instruct the lender to recalculate your monthly
interest payments accordingly.
Otherwise, most lenders will treat the money as overpayment of interest and
will not take it into account until the end of their financial year.
It has never been in lenders' interest to encourage repayment of capital,
since they lose interest. However, Yorkshire Bank, a tiny player in the
mortgage market, today launches its Flexible Payment Mortgage which
encourages borrowers to step up their repayments, although they can drop
back to the minimum level if they need to. This minimum payment level is set
at 8 per cent. Since the bank's current variable rate is currently 7.65 per
cent, the overpayment of interest is taken into account.
Lump sum repayments of as little as Pounds 25 can be made and interest is
calculated on a daily basis so that the next payments reflect the lower
interest. The borrower can also choose the date on which to make the
payments and whether to do so on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. The
fee for the mortgage is Pounds 150 - the same as for the bank's standard
repayment mortgage.
A small increase in monthly payments can make a huge difference. If you paid
the minimum on a Pounds 60,000 loan from the bank, monthly payments would be
Pounds 468.39 and the interest would amount to Pounds 76,341 at the end of
the 25 years. But if you decided to overpay by less than Pounds 7, so that
monthly payments were Pounds 475, you would wipe Pounds 14,046.56 off the
interest.
UCB Home Loans has a similar product but charges Pounds 25 each time you
vary the payment.
Old endowments
First-time buyers are not the only ones with mortgage choices. Existing
home-owners can also take their pick of repayment or interest only
mortgages, with all the different repayment methods. But if you already have
an endowment policy taken out to cover a previous mortgage, your decision
becomes more complicated. If you want a repayment mortgage, what do you do
with the endowment? If you choose an interest-only loan, what happens if the
endowment is not enough to cover a new loan on a bigger property?
Ian Darby, of specialist mortgage bankers John Charcol, says the first piece
of advice must be to hang on to the endowment. Since these are long-term
savings vehicles, you will get the highest return if you carry on paying
premiums into the policy until its scheduled maturity date (but see below
for other options).
If you want a straight repayment mortgage this time, the endowment policy
will become redundant as a mortgage repayment method, but you can keep it
going as a free-standing savings policy - it is simply no longer assigned to
the building society. This is only a good idea if you can afford to pay
capital and interest on the new loan in addition to endowment premiums.
Alternatively, if you have an endowment due to deliver, say, Pounds 100,000,
but you need to borrow Pounds 150,000 for your new property, you could
structure the new mortgage so Pounds 50,000 is repayment, and the remaining
Pounds 100,000 is interest-only, covered by the existing endowment.
Or you could make the whole mortgage interest-only, and then choose whether
you want a second endowment or perhaps a Pep to cover the extra Pounds
50,000. Darby says building societies are becoming more flexible about
repayment methods, so other savings vehicles, such as unit or investment
trusts, or employee share option schemes, could be built into the equation.
If your existing endowment is due to mature in 15 or 20 years' time, you
could consider repaying the rest of the new mortgage over the same period,
rather than going for the usual 25 years. While interest rates are low, and
if you have spare income, this could be worthwhile and affordable.
Cancelling the endowment
If for any reason you cannot afford to carry on paying premiums on your
existing endowment, there are three main options. But Darby warns:
'Virtually all the alternatives, from surrender, to auctioning your policy,
to making it paid up, do not represent good value, given the investment that
people have already made in their premiums.'
Making the policy 'paid up' means that you pay no further premiums, but the
money you have already paid is still invested, and continues to grow until
the original maturity date. When it matures, the policy will not be worth as
much as if you had paid all the premiums, but there may still be a decent
lump sum.
If you do not want to pay any more, and you would rather cash the policy in,
you can either surrender the policy to the life company, or sell it to
another investor, through an auction or a broker. You usually get more by
selling than surrendering, but much less than by keeping it on. If the
endowment is less than five years old, or if it is from a company with a
poor investment record, it may be difficult to sell.
It is best to talk to an independent adviser and discuss all the options
before deciding to discontinue an endowment.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Bulls take a run on the middle range - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in a week when London stocks closed at record levels, the 135.5 point
jump in the FT-SE Mid 250 index on Wednesday was the stuff of bull market
legends replete with tales of terrible squeezes and aborted buying
programmes.
Lacking such drama, the rise in the broad market could not even muster much
new economic justification. Ken Clarke squelched hopes of an early interest
rate cut by invoking the spectre of inflationary Chancellors-past. 'Nigel
Lawson. . . would agree looking back that he had already reduced them too
much' when he gave in to public pressure and kicked in the after-burners on
his late-1980s boom.
The FT-SE 100 rose 83.6 points on the week to a record close of 3,484.2 and
a gain of 1.9 per cent since the begining of the year. More impressively,
though, the FT-SE Mid 250 pushed on to an 8.3 per cent year-to-date rise,
closing up 190 points at 4,105.8.
The index, which captures the 250 largest companies below the top-tier 100,
has been out-performing the Footsie for a while. Strategists see it as a
more effective way than the Footsie to play the UK economic recovery.
Judging by the way investors piled into it this week, creating market
turmoil in their wake, they believe its attractions will last a while.
The day the UK left the ERM in September, 1992, shares began their unchecked
run up. As the chart shows, the two indices tracked each other for a few
months but by the beginning of last year the Mid 250 began to pull away.
This month, it has raced ahead. Investors bought Pounds 3.4bn worth of
shares in the index in the first four days of this week, against Pounds
10.6bn all of last month.
The vault on Wednesday, when non-Footsie stocks accounted for a hefty 70 per
cent of the day's trading volume, was the index's largest one-day gain since
it was started two years ago. Part of the gain was attributable to technical
factors, particularly a severe stock shortage. One Swiss-based house was
said to be caught out trying to amass enough shares to underpin a warrant on
the Mid 250.
Illiquidity is a problem. The market capitalisation of the 100 index is
Pounds 570bn, an average of Pounds 5.7bn per company. Even so, investors can
be frustrated trying to buy or sell the bottom 20 or so Footsie stocks in
quantity. The Mid 250 has a market capitalsiation of Pounds 173bn, an
average of Pounds 700m per company. The smallest is Amstrad at Pounds 235m.
Not only is stock hard to come by, but investors tend to buy for the longer
term.
'You have to work as hard to put half a million pounds into a 250 stock as,
say, Pounds 200m into BTR,' says Mike Bishop, a director of Gartmore, the
fund manager.
But do not be dazzled by the fireworks. 'There are investment trends here
that the illiquidity masks,' says Robert Buckland, UK equity strategist at
NatWest Securities.
Investors are buying the stocks for their UK exposure. The general
manufacturers sector, for example, embracing contractors, building material
suppliers, engineers and other highly cyclical stocks, account for 32 per
cent of the Mid 250 against only 14 per cent for the Footsie. Electricity
and water stocks, favoured for their dividend growth, account for 11.2 per
cent against only 5.1 per cent of the Footise.
Many of the constituents also offer better exposure than big stocks to
currency and interest factors, argues Paul Walton, equity market strategist
at James Capel. 'If the major exporters lose out from weak European markets
and a strengthening pound then domestic stocks - typically smaller cap - are
better placed and moreover should benefit from any subsequent interest rate
cut.'
He forecasts that the Mid 250 and FT-SE Small Cap indexes, the latter
covering the bottom chunk of the All Share Index, will outperform the
Footsie by 15 per cent and 25 per cent respectively this year.
One might, however, draw a note of caution from a longer perspective. From
the end of 1985 to the end of 1988, the Mid 250 outperformed the Footsie by
about 25 per cent. By its subsequent trough, in September, 1992, it had
underperformed by about 9 per cent. Thanks to this week's gains, the index
is now about two-thirds of the way back towards its peak outperformance.
Corporate corroboration of the smaller company investment story came with
several items of company news. Spring Ram (kitchens and bathrooms), Stanley
Leisure (betting shops and casinos) and Crest Nicholson (house builder)
tapped shareholders for some Pounds 80m in rights issues.
Evidence of the potential for smaller companies' growth was also supplied by
Carclo, the engineering group. Its pre-tax interim pre-tax profits were up
41 per cent, thanks in part to successful integration of Arthur Lee, the
steel maker it bought in June.
The biggest story of the week - the rejigging of Guinness and LVMH's
cross-ownership - hardly fits the mould unless Tony Greener, Guinness's
chairman, has a particularly Machiavellian scheme in mind. The UK group has
swapped its 24 per cent stake in the French group for a 34 per cent stake in
its Moet Hennessy drinks subsidiary and Pounds 416m in cash. The new
arrangement could come in handy for Guinness if it tried to hive off a nice
little drinks business should LVMH's media and fashion adventures cause it
grief.
Tesco also conceded that smaller might be perkier. Three years ago,
launching a Pounds 572m rights issue, it extolled the virtues of its mammoth
72,000 sq ft flagship stores. The stock has gone down hill ever since. This
week it sharply cut capital spending, began depreciating its land and
buildings and talked of building more compact 20,000 sq ft Metro stores. The
switch spoke volumes about the suddenly less grandiose visions rampant in
the retail food sector.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Meeting a need for income - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Security and the desire for income are uppermost in many investors minds.
After years of high inflation and high interest rates which led to easy
double-digit returns in the building society, investors are only just
beginning to acknowledge that low interest rates are not an aberration but
may become the norm.
Fund management groups have been working hard to come up with products to
meet the desire for income, and this week the government pitched in with the
launch by National Savings of a Pensioners guaranteed income bond which pays
monthly income.
The fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five years is the best on the market
for sums as low as the minimum investment of Pounds 500 (see Page IV). The
snag is that only those who are aged 65 and above can take out the bond and
there is a limit of Pounds 20,000 per person.
What should other investors do? James Capel and Newton are the latest in a
line of investment houses to launch products allowing investors to make
regular withdrawals to supplement their income.
Both have been careful to avoid the word income in their product titles,
since they cannot guarantee that stock market performance will be good
enough to replenish the original investment.
James Capel, which forms part of HSBC Asset Management, has branded its
product the 'Generator' Personal Equity Plan, while Newton's latest unit
trust is called the 'Distributor Fund'. How do they work?
The James Capel Pep is attached to its UK Tracker fund, which attempts to
match the performance of the FT-A All Share index. Investors either put in a
lump sum (the minimum is Pounds 3,000 and the maximum is the Pep limit of
Pounds 6,000), or choose to invest a monthly minimum of Pounds 50.
They can then select a payout capped at 7.5 per cent, which will be paid
directly into their bank or building society account on the 15th of each
month (those choosing the savings plan have to build up to the Pounds 3,000
first). The payout can be varied, so investors can choose to reinvest their
dividends for capital growth. Charges are an initial 5.25 per cent initial
with an annual fee of 1 per cent, compared to 0.5 per cent on the fund
itself, because of the extra administration involved.
The Newton unit trust is based on a similar idea. It allows investors to
select a regular 'distribution' of up to 9 per cent which will be paid
quarterly. There is a Pep facility at no extra cost beyond the fund's fairly
steep 6 per cent initial charge and 1.5 per cent annual fee. The fund will
initially have a 65 per cent holding in UK equities, 10 per cent in
international equities and a 25 per cent holding of UK and international
bonds.
Any fund paying out more than the current yield on the FT-A All-Share of
about 3 per cent is going to have to rely on the growth of the market to
maintain the original capital. Otherwise, investors will find that their
capital is being paid back to them as income - something which they can do
for themselves in the building society.
Newton says that it believes it will be able, over a three year rolling
period, to replace the value, in real terms, of the capital which is
distributed. James Capel says it has fixed the 7.5 per cent maximum on the
basis of UK equities producing a total return over the past 30 years
(1962-92) of 13 per cent per annum.
However, there is no guarantee that equities will perform as well in the
future. Indeed, the total return figure for the the previous 30 years
(1932-62) was 9.5 per cent per annum and it may be lower over the next
30-year period. If performance is not high enough, the fund managers will
have to work very hard to replenish the capital.
How hard they work depends on how much the investor has regularly drawn and
on the performance of the market. The schemes work best, as you might
expect, when the market is buoyant.
The danger is that if the market falls and investors continue to draw, say 9
per cent, from the Newton fund, they may erode their capital to a point
where it cannot be built up to the same level again.
In the early 1970s when yields were low but the stock market was performing
strongly, many investors flocked into unit trust withdrawal plans, which
allowed investors to take a fixed percentage from the fund. However, the
extent of the 1973-74 stock market crash meant that many investors,
particularly those who had chosen to make withdrawals of up to 10 per cent,
found that the value of their original capital was all but wiped out.
Unlike Hypo F &amp; C's High Income plan, launched last year, which pays out a
regular 10 per cent a year, the level of withdrawals in the James Capel and
Newton products is left to the investor. This has the advantage of giving
him the ability to turn off the income tap when the market underperforms but
it also places on him the responsibility to do so. The danger is that if
investors becomes dependent on regular withdrawals for their income, they
may find it impossible to cut back.
There is nothing inherently wrong with these schemes, and indeed they may be
useful in fulfilling many people's needs for income, so long as the investor
knows the risks and is happy with the general investment strategy of both
funds and with the track record of the managers.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: FT Quarterly Review - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To most people, the benefits of investing offshore are far from clear. But
Kenneth Clarke's Budget did make one tax change that could give offshore
funds an advantage. The winter issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal
Finance, to be published with next Friday's paper and repeated with
Saturday's, considers the pros and cons of five types of offshore
investment. The survey section of the review focuses on domestic finance
matters, including school fees, the cost of going to university and paying
for a wedding.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Barclays charges move - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays is to give personal customers advance notice of charges on their
bank accounts, although no date has yet been set for the process to start.
This gives customers time to query charges before they are imposed, and
helps stop people going unintentionally overdrawn because of charges.
Barclays has been pre-notifying business customers for some time. Some other
high street banks, including NatWest, already give their customers advance
warning of charges, and it is likely to become a requirement under a new
banking code of practice. Lloyds recently announced it would introduce the
practice.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Debit cards are widely regarded as a replacement for cheques, according to
the Credit Card Research Group, and are used for cheaper purchases than
credit cards. The most popular outlets for the use of debit cards are
supermarkets, off licences and petrol stations, while credit cards
expenditure is more widely spread across the retail sector. Total plastic
card spending in the UK was Pounds 49.6bn in 1993 up from Pounds 43.9bn in
1992.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Personal equity plans increase in popularity - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal equity plans, which allow individuals to invest in shares without
paying income or capital gains tax, have become increasingly popular with
savers. The 1992-93 tax year saw an inflow of Pounds 3.12bn invested in
general plans - the highest since the launch of the first Peps in 1987. Some
770,000 new general plans were taken out during the course of the tax year.
Single company Peps, which were introduced on January 1 1992 attracted a
total of Pounds 640m into 250,000 plans by the end of the 1992-93 tax year.
Pep investment was changed from a calendar year to a tax-year basis from
April 1990. The Inland Revenue figures do not reflect withdrawals or growth
in plan values.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Dow climbs on its cyclicals and reaches peak - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If investors in US stocks were looking to the latest corporate reporting
season for some justification for the high levels to which share prices have
been pushed, they had plenty of good news to cheer them last week.
The first batch of results for the final quarter of 1993 painted a picture
of a corporate sector enjoying a faster-than expected pick up in demand at
home and considerable benefits from the prolonged round of cost-cutting and
restructuring of the early 1990s. Barring one or two nasty shocks in
pharmaceuticals and the computer industry, results generally came in at or
above the more optimistic analysts' expectations.
Whether the earnings momentum is enough to support share prices at their
current levels or push them higher is another matter. Dividend increases
have been more modest than the rise in earnings, as many companies continue
to rebuild their capital or conserve resources in anticipation of an
expansion in working capital in the months ahead. And with the dividend
yield on the Dow Jones Industrial Average already down at a lowly 2.6 per
cent or so, each new upward twist in share prices puts extra strain on this
valuation basis of the market.
But last week was not a time to linger too long over such thoughts. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average continued its climb to new highs, breaking through
the 3,900 barrier yesterday morning after ending the previous week at 3,867.
The Dow continued to outperform the broadly-based S &amp; P 500: by mid-day
yesterday, the narrow 30-stock average was up 3.7 per cent from the end of
last year, twice as much as the broader index.
It only takes a brief look at the composition of the Dow to work out why.
With its heavy weighting towards cyclical stocks, the Dow continued to
benefit last week from the craze for companies which would benefit from an
acceleration of economic growth. While it only contains two financial stocks
(JP Morgan and American Express), the 30-stock average has a wide range of
cyclical industries: chemicals (DuPont and Union Carbide), metals and mining
(Bethlehem Steel, Alcoa and 3M) and autos (General Motors), along with
Caterpillar, Goodyear and International Paper.
These have been among the stars of the stock market in recent days and
weeks. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment,
jumped by 8 per cent in a week capped by a stronger-than expected earnings
announcement yesterday. The week had begun in similar mood, with Chrysler
taking the market by surprise with the robustness of its growth and in the
process giving a lift to GM and Ford.
Not surprisingly, the chemicals and steel companies - which stand to benefit
from greater demand as auto makers and other customers expand - are also
among the biggest success stories of the year so far. Taking just those in
the Dow average, DuPont's shares are now 11 per cent higher than at the
start of the year, Union Carbide is up 12.5 per cent (it gave an upbeat
preview of its latest results) and Bethlehem Steel is 13 per cent ahead.
Neither steel nor chemical companies have much room to lift their prices,
given the worldwide overcapacity in both industries, but at least they can
expect to take up some of the slack from recent years while reaping the
benefits of cost-cutting.
This mania for cyclical industries served to overshadow a series of powerful
earnings reports from US banks. Against the background of sharply rising
profits all round, Citicorp stood out: not only has it bounced back from the
brink of disaster in only two years, but its latest figures suggested that
it could be one of the few commercial banks to see a sustained rise in
revenues in the coming quarters (unlike others, Citicorp clung fast to its
worldwide reach during the bad times, and is now benefitting from growth in
developing countries).
All of this had little to do with the stock market's obsessions last week,
though. The latest figures seemed a good opportunity to sell off bank
stocks, taking profits and moving into cyclical industries.
Also suffering was the pharmaceuticals sector, dragged down by weak sales at
Pfizer, which had seemed to offer better prospects for growth than most
other drug companies. Digital Equipment, which gave a downbeat view of
prospects for the first half of this year, dragged down technology stocks
for a while - good news from Microsoft and Apple later in the week helped
reverse the rot.
On balance, though, there was little to disturb the general sense of
well-being. Bar a round of profit-taking, Wall Street seemed to have
prepared itself for two more weeks of good profits.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: A tipple investors may like - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness, after all, may be good for investors. That was the market's view
this week after the UK drinks group radically reshaped its alliance with
LVMH, the French cognac, champagne and luxury goods company.
There was a time when there was no doubt about Guinness's benefits to
shareholders. Between 1987 and 1992, the group's share price rose 300 per
cent and dividends increased 158 per cent.
During those years, under Sir Anthony Tennant, the company was reaping the
rewards of reorganising the spirits business acquired in the controversial
takeover of Distillers Company. Brands such as Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky
were being refurbished, repackaged and repositioned. Distribution was being
brought under direct control and extended. Markets were buoyant.
Profits grew organically by over 40 per cent between 1990 and 1992 in spite
of the shadow of recession. But towards the end of that period, doubts began
to appear.
Growth slowed. For the first time for 13 years, pre-tax profits in 1992
fell, slipping 12 per cent.
Tony Greener took over from Sir Anthony in 1993 in a much more hostile
trading climate. Economic conditions in some of the group's most important
markets had deteriorated. Falling demand and over-production hit the Scotch
whisky industry. Guinness closed five whisky distilleries, with the loss of
700 jobs.
Brewing also had its problems - notably in Cruzcampo, the Spanish brewer. A
costly programme of redundancies was required there, too.
Some analysts began to mourn the demise of the de-luxe decade in the global
spirits industry, suggesting that more value-conscious consumers were
unlikely ever again to pay the price of premium brands.
Guinness's sliding share price reflected that sentiment - reinforced by
similar worries about the cognac, champagne and luxury goods business of
LVMH, its French partner.
The alliance came under frequent and questioning scrutiny. The success of
the joint distribution ventures it had established throughout the world
could be measured. They contributed 25 per cent of Guinness's spirits
profits.
But there was growing unease about the two companies' 24 per cent
cross-shareholdings. Guinness, with an indirect holding, was regarded as a
passive investor in LVMH with little influence to show for its Pounds 1bn
investment. The new-found enthusiasm of Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman, for
expansion into publishing and fashion did nothing to allay the concern.
Those worries continued to overhang the Guinness share price even after it
reached its lowest point, 400p, on the day that Crispin Davis resigned after
little more than a year as managing director of United Distillers, the
group's spirits division, last October.
The restructuring of the alliance on Thursday changed City attitudes at a
stroke. 'A strategic coup,' said Jonathan Goble, analyst at BZW. 'A positive
for Guinness,' said John Wakely, of Lehman Brothers. 'Good sense,' said Eric
Frankis, of Hoare Govett.
A 10 per cent rise in the share price confirmed that consensus.
Guinness has exchanged its 24 per cent indirect holding in LVMH for a 34 per
cent direct stake in Moet Hennessy, the group's cognac and champagne
business, and Pounds 416m cash.
Apart from the minority blockage rights of the stake, Guinness has also
negotiated pre-emption rights on the MH brands - Hennessy and Hine cognac,
Moet Chandon and Veuve Clicquot champagne.
It has thus become a commercial partner in the LVMH in which its real
interest lies and divorced itself from Arnault's plans for the group as a
whole.
The deal has been done as the markets for cognac and champagne are beginning
to improve - and at a cost of perhaps 4 per cent dilution in earnings per
share.
It offers prospects of increased co-operation and improved performance in
Asia/Pacific and other world markets.
Guinness's 1993 results will show that the decline in profits has been
checked.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Peasants]: Les paysans Francais - keepers of the countryside
wearing berets and striped jerseys? Or straw-burning troublemakers who stand
in the way of progress? Nicholas Woodsworth uses his family ties to
investigate a threatened way of life
</HEADLINE>

It is 15 years since I first met the Chauvin clan in the hills of Provence.
It was an exotic occasion, a country Christmas celebration to which I was
coaxed - neither entirely willingly, nor at ease - by my French wife-to-be
so that she might present me to her family. I was impressed, but also
intimidated, by the gathering. Here, at a long farm table flanked by four
generations of Chauvins, was a world in which I felt wholly alien.
The food alone was exotic enough. There were stews of wild boar shot in the
hills behind the house; baby quails - still complete with tiny beaks and
claws - sewn up and baked in the oven; omelettes stuffed with truffles
sniffed out of the earth by a much-prized family dog. To me, it was all
splendid, outlandish and totally new.
Even more exotic than the food, however, were the guests themselves: a
confusing array of moustachioed uncles, Gauloise-smoking grandfathers,
Pernod-sipping nieces. These people, I thought, were positively tribal:
between the 30 or so extended family members present, there was a
commingling, a sense of sharing through ties of blood which had nothing of
the Anglo-Saxon in its warmth and demonstrativeness.
The Chauvins were also different politically. I had never socialised with
Marxists before. Here, though, was a dining room full of militant leftists
and card-carrying communists munching Christmas cake as happily as anyone
else.
There was, however, something else that made this family so completely
different for me. It was simply their daily working lives. For the Chauvins,
as they themselves told me proudly, were paysans (peasants).
In England, the term belongs to an earlier, feudal age. Not so in France,
where few urban families have to look back more than a generation or two to
find roots deep in the countryside. Here, beside the little river Doa in the
Provencal back country, nothing at all separated the Chauvins from their
past: they remained tied to the soil as physically and emotionally as their
ancestors 400 years before. It was this sense of belonging, this deep
attachment to a long-lived peasant tradition, that impressed me most.
We all have an image of the paysan in our minds. In his most hackneyed form,
he is cycling down the road, a beret on his head and a string of onions over
his handlebars. There are variations. Sometimes, he is sly, calculating and
miserly. At other times, he is cheerful, loquacious and sociable. Even when
he has nothing at all to say, he still entertains by pushing his lips
forward and giving us that famous Gallic shrug.
Lately, though, the image has changed and the French peasant has stopped
entertaining us. He is no longer the amusing character from A Year in
Provence. He is the backward-looking reactionary who has tried to block
economic progress for the rest of us. In an effort to retain farm subsidies
and state protection for an outmoded way of life, he has set straw bales
alight on the French autoroutes, blocked Parisian traffic with tractors, and
done what he can to wreck negotiations on world trade. He has refused to
change with a changing Europe.
Is the new image of the French peasant a valid one - or is it as stereotyped
and misinformed as its predecessors?
Following that first meeting, I grew to admire the Chauvins tremendously.
They were a resilient, resourceful, hard-working clan. They never had much
money, but it seemed to me that they had something quite as valuable about
them: quiet self-assurance and satisfaction with life.
Later, I moved from France and lost touch with them. But, through the family
connection, I heard over the years that that satisfaction was fast
disappearing and that hard times had settled on the Doa. Not long ago, I
returned to find out for myself how an old peasant family and modern Europe
were getting along together . . .
Going nowhere at Les Gauds
Jean Chauvin, my wife's great-grandfather, had more sense of adventure than
money. He was not conscripted into the French colonial army but, as was
often the custom then, was paid to take the place of someone who was. He
survived the invasion of Tonkin in one piece and on his return, like
everyone in the family, took up farming.
Contrary to popular image, Provence is not a mild, beneficent land. It is
harsh: cold and windy in winter, dry and scorching in summer. In the Rhone
valley, flat land, good soil and plenty of water for irrigation give western
Provence rich fruit and vegetable crops. In Chauvin country, further to the
east in the flinty hills and valleys that eventually rise to become the
Alps, smallhold farming is an altogether more precarious affair.
Nonetheless, in the narrow Doa valley outside the market town of Apt, Jean
brought up four florid and brawny sons, each of whom in turn began farming
there. One still survives. With his wife Marthe, Aime lives at Les Gauds, a
tiny family hamlet of stone houses perched on the valley-side.
Aime Chauvin is not as active as he used to be: a few years ago, an accident
with a roto-tiller left him with one leg. But, at 81, he still gets around
in a Citroen with a hand-operated clutch; and, when visitors ask him, he can
still recall life at Les Gauds before any machines made an appearance there.
Together, we sat at the dining table and Tante Marthe poured me a small
glass of home-made walnut wine to take the chill off the winter's day. To
most people the bare, tiled floors and simple furniture at Les Gauds would
appear spartan. But, said Tante Marthe, compared with the pre-war years, she
and Aime live like kings.
Until 1938, there was no electricity in the valley and evenings were spent
in lamp-light. The toilet was outdoors, as was the well for water and the
stone basin for washing clothes. The shops in Apt were an hour's walk away -
and too expensive to use much, anyway. Marthe grew, raised or made most of
what they lived on right there - vegetables, pigs, chickens, olives, wine
and goat cheese all were tended by her busy hands. Ready money for other
daily needs came from the herd of sheep she kept. Horses to plough the wheat
fields did not disappear until the early 1950s when Aime bought his first
tractor.
Like the hands of all elderly peasants, Marthe's are battered and worn;
rarely, in the course of her working life, was there much time for herself.
Nor was there money, Marthe said, for simple things like a new dress or a
visit to the hairdresser. Instead, it went into buying, piece by piece, that
single most important peasant possession - land. By the time he retired,
Aime had added 11 hectares to the five he had inherited originally.
'Materially, things were not easy,' sighed Marthe, 'but it was a good life.
There was a wonderful closeness in families then, and between neighbours,
too. What is more, we all knew where we were going; we knew we would never
get rich but, with the produce from 16 hectares, Aime and I were able to
earn a living, raise our children, build a house, and equip the farm. That
is what hurts now. With all the will in the world, no young peasant could
produce enough on 16 hectares to do that today.'
Marthe and Aime were not speaking in abstract terms. The young peasant to
whom they were referring is their 38-year-old son, Daniel, who now owns the
farm. Land, once a fixed standard by which peasant prosperity was measured,
no longer has its traditional value - other factors have intervened. Unlike
his parents, Daniel has no idea where he is going.
Politics of survival at Le Marronier
A kilometre down the road, in a house under a broad chestnut tree, another
of Jean's sons set to tilling the earth in the 1920s. Not only was Louis an
energetic peasant-farmer, he was also a staunch anti-cleric and socialist
council member for Apt. Succeeding generations followed suit. Robert, son of
Louis, fought with a left-wing Resistance organisation during the second
world war. As teenagers in the turbulent 1960s and '70s, four of Robert's
six children joined the French communist youth movement.
Robert and I took a stroll around the 20 hillside hectares of cherry trees,
table-grape and wine vineyards, and marrow and melon fields that he began
laying out after the war with draught animals. They are now owned by
Rolland, Robert's son.
'When, like Aime, I was finally able to change my horses for a tractor,'
Robert mused, 'I thought: 'At last] Life is going to get better.' But it
didn't. We had to work all that much harder to pay for the tractors and stay
competitive with everyone else who bought tractors. The progress was
technological, not social. It wasn't real progress at all. But not even
technological logic applies any more. Through the '60s and '70s, the harder
you worked, the more you produced and the greater was your return. It
doesn't work like that now.'
We trudged up the soggy winter hillside, mud sticking to our shoes. 'Life
has been getting increasingly difficult for 10 years,' Robert went on.
'Every year, production costs rise: insurance, farm machinery, fertilisers,
insecticides, packaging, transport, cold-storage charges. But, in the same
decade, the prices we have been getting for our produce have stayed the
same, or fallen. In mathematical terms, it is simple - we can no longer make
a profit from what we do. Our concern now is just surviving.'
Could things be that bad? Talk to Rolland, Robert urged me. We found him,
thin and wiry, pruning in a vineyard. In the summer season, he is on his
feet and running from 4am until 10 at night. Now, in a slower season, he had
time to talk.
After Rolland took over the farm from his father in 1980, he worked it with
his wife, Josianne. They could not afford hired help because of high social
security contributions. In spite of the saving, they made little headway: in
the mid-1980s, each earned FFr5,000 (a little more than Pounds 500) a month
 -just enough to re-invest in the farm to keep it going.
Four years ago, things got so bad that Josianne had to take a job in town to
assure the family a viable income. Rolland created a farming partnership
with his cousin, Daniel, and they began working the two farms together. Last
year, each made FFr5,000 a month, the same sum that Rolland earned a decade
ago. They can no longer afford new investment.
Rolland was something of a hot-head in his youth. As a Marxist militant, he
used to take part in roadside ambushes of highway tankers carrying cheap
Spanish wine. Emptying them was a way of protecting the French market.
Today, like all the Chauvins, he has forsaken leftist politics - they have
failed entirely to answer the needs of the paysan.
Nor does he believe any longer that markets can be protected by crude means.
He knows the problem of falling local prices is a complex one with worldwide
causes: cheap agricultural imports from third world countries with low wage
and social security costs have made his own produce uncompetitive.
Raising trade barriers is not the answer for Rolland: in the end, he
believes, only global commerce will solve global imbalance. Nor are EU
subsidies an answer. At his level of farming, he said, they make up only the
shortfall between producer cost and market price. Breaking even does not
allow a centime of new investment; inevitably, farms become run down and go
broke. Already, Rolland knows of seven farmers in the area who have given up
and are doing garden maintenance for foreigners with holiday homes there.
Rolland cannot bear the idea of leaving farming for another job. It is the
only thing he has ever wanted to do, and he believes Provencal small farmers
might eventually succeed in a market not of quantity but of high quality. In
the meantime, he says, something must change. It cannot go on.
Robert, though, is not quite sure what changes are possible. 'I cannot see
the solutions to peasant decline and the frustrations that come with it.
Economically, I am not sure there are any.'
His real worry is over the political fallout; his years in the Resistance
have given him an uncomfortable perspective. 'Every day, we live in greater
uncertainty. I have seen it before. It is an atmosphere that breeds a
certain mentality - I am afraid of a resurgence of what I fought against in
the war. I thought I would never have to think of fascism again.'
Passion for the land at Les Jeans-Jeans
I left Le Marronier feeling low, but three minutes further down the road, I
cheered up. Les Jeans-Jeans is another tiny hamlet filled with the offspring
of yet another of Jean Chauvin's sons, Gaston. I arrived in time for lunch.
The Chauvins of Les Jeans-Jeans are a gregarious lot, with a generous sense
of hospitality and a great appetite for good things to eat and drink. They
have had their share of human tragedies and farming disasters, which could
be why they find such comfort in sociability. One does not stay a stranger
there for very long.
When Gerard Chauvin, a vast man with a great, biblical beard, talks about
the land, he shows as much enthusiasm for life as his great-grandfather,
Jean, ever did. Unlike his cousins, Rolland and Daniel, he keeps a herd of
50 goats. He is concerned about increasing regulation of his life by
Brussels. He has nightmares about EU bans on unpasteurised cheese, which
would wipe him out. But, for the time being, there is a good market for
high-quality French goat cheese, and it allows Gerard to pursue the only
life he cares about.
After a vast meal and endless glasses of home-made muscadet, he walked me
out through the fields towards the tinkling sound of goat bells. He talked
for much of the afternoon - about goats, mountain trout fishing,
sausage-making, hunting dogs, liquor stills, rabbit habits, delivering baby
calves and much more besides. Gerard loves these things with a passion.
I was somewhat reassured. If there were still people like that, I thought,
peasant life in Provence might survive after all, in one form or another.

FT  22 JAN 94 / The Long View: Profits take the lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
Rotation can make you giddy. There have been some big structural shifts in
the London equity market recently, with the big blue chips racing up over
Christmas, for instance, but the middle-sized stocks producing a spectacular
upsurge this week. With share prices on average at fairly giddy heights
there is a desperate search going on for value that might justify further
appreciation.
The underlying theory is that at a certain point in a bull market the main
driving force ceases to be the push from excess liquidity and begins to be
the pull from profits growth. Although profits have been rising for a year
or so now - the consensus expectation is that earnings per share for 1993
will have shown 15 per cent growth on average, against zero for 1992 - it is
primarily the fall in interest rates that has generated the higher
valuations.
That this is still the case was shown by the market's economically perverse
reaction on Wednesday to the news that December retail sales were supposedly
lower than in November. Never mind that peculiar seasonal adjustments
probably make the official Yuletide retail sales statistics almost
meaningless. The stock market fastened on to the idea that weak activity
would encourage the government to make an early cut in interest rates. If
business was indeed poor the impact on company profits would presumably be
negative - but about this the market appeared to care not one jot.
Nevertheless investors are exploring various sector themes. In the early
part of a bull market interest-rate sensitive sectors such as financials,
property and construction tend to shine. Somewhat later, consumer goods show
well and then, late in the cycle, capital goods sectors are likely to be
boosted by rising physical investment as output bumps up against capacity.
Recently many investors have been captured by the theme of rising commodity
prices as the global recovery gathers pace: hence, for instance, the success
of Mercury Asset Management's World Mining Trust in pulling in Pounds 426m
when launched last month.
But how great is the scope in general for British companies to achieve
significantly higher profits? Although in some parts of the world companies
are suffering severely from the recession - in Germany, for instance, and
especially in Japan - British companies weathered the last economic downturn
relatively well. According to the national accounts the profits of
industrial and commercial companies had already rallied to a 14.3 per cent
share of national income by the third quarter of 1993, making a sharp bounce
back from 1991's low point of about 11.5 per cent.
Stock market analysts are projecting further earnings per share gains of
about 15 per cent in 1994 and 13 per cent in 1995. The interesting point is
that these compare with much lower expectations for the growth of earnings
of employees, now running at only about 3 per cent and unlikely to rise very
substantially over the next year or two.
If the City analysts are right then the share of profits in income is set to
rise to around 16 per cent in 1994 and perhaps 17 per cent in 1995 - well
ahead of the 15 per cent share reached at the peak of the last cycle, in
1987. Part of the explanation may be the impact of the hugely profitable
privatised utilities which have progressively expanded the company sector
since the early 1980s (they account for about 22 per cent of the earnings of
All-Share Index constituents). But there is also the implication of a
substantial shift in economic power from labour to capital.
Over many years in the UK the growth of wages has been slightly higher on
average than the growth of company earnings per share: since 1960, in fact,
pay has grown at 10.2 per cent annually, and earnings per share at 9 per
cent (price inflation, incidentally, has averaged 7.8 per cent).
One explanation for the collapse of the inflation rate in the UK and many
other western countries has been the growth of competition from
newly-industrialising countries. But such brutal competition would surely
have produced more pressure on profits than has been seen (although it is
true that most of the impact would be focused on the relatively small
manufacturing sector). As it happened, however, the margins squeeze in
manufacturing was relaxed by sterling's sudden dive after Black Wednesday in
September 1992. The puzzle was that, contrary to historical experience, pay
inflation was not stimulated by that episode, so we have to assume the
development of an underlying labour surplus of a kind not seen since the
1930s.
If business is indeed becoming exceptionally profitable in the UK, there
will be other positive effects beyond a booming stock market: for instance,
the stimulation of output should quickly cure the capacity shortages which
have produced balance of payments problems even in the depths of recession.
But we also have to bear in mind that such conditions have not been
sustainable in the past; rising corporate income has quickly been
transmitted to wages, and sterling has tended to rise to less competitive
levels. This time, we have to project that slow growth of consumers' incomes
will be topped up by a fall in savings (or in practice, a rise in
borrowings) in order to sustain demand; and that climbing exports will not
send the pound too high.
It is also worth mentioning the importance of raw material input costs,
which have recently been exceptionally low - with the oil price, for
instance, back in real terms to where it was before the first oil shock in
the early 1970s. The investors who are piling into commodity shares to
exploit the first signs of an upturn in the commodity price indices ought
also to think of the possible impact of raw material price inflation on
corporate profits elsewhere.
In these tricky conditions you may need to perform a few gyrations to find
your way to the sectors where the best of these profits are going to be
earned.

The failure of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition to carry the day on
political reform might have been expected to send the yen lower. Whether or
not a general election now follows, the promised package of economic
stimulus measures will almost certainly be postponed. That can only be bad
for Japan's growth prospects, and makes another cut in interest rates more
likely. The strength of the Japanese currency in the face of these arguments
stems from worries over trade.
Yesterday's trade figures are a reminder that Japan's current account
surplus is still growing in dollar terms. That creates a natural demand for
yen which is not being offset by Japanese buying of overseas financial
assets. More importantly, if Japan cannot deliver a fiscal stimulus to get
its economy moving, the US might again be tempted to talk the yen higher as
a way of tackling trade.
With Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, visiting Tokyo this
weekend - and a meeting between heads of government still scheduled for next
month - much now depends on the US response. But using the exchange rate as
a trade weapon could easily backfire. If Japanese industry is lumbered with
an unfavourable exchange rate and deprived of a fiscal package, the outlook
for growth would be bleak. Managing the trade surplus lower would then be
doubly hard.

It is surely no coincidence that the government announced a review of
building society regulation on the same day its new National Savings bond
was launched. After the argument over the First Option Bond - which was
withdrawn in 1992 when societies threatened to raise mortgage rates - the
government is clearly keen to avoid another spat. Yet the 7 per cent yield
on the new five-year income bond is probably the minimum required to satisfy
pensioners. And reform to allow building societies greater access to the
wholesale money markets would make competition from National Savings easier
to bear.
Even without the latest National Savings launch, building societies have
been fighting a losing battle for deposits. The Pounds 121m outflow in
December announced yesterday underlines the point. A rise in the wholesale
funding limit - currently 40 per cent - would clear the way for another
round of Eurobond issues by societies. That would help them to defend their
share of the mortgage market against banks when the housing market turns.
Pushing the wholesale funding limit above 50 per cent would be tricky.
Societies' mutual status relies on the majority of their funds coming from
members. That might involve a wider review of legislation than the
government is prepared to undertake. Making it easier for societies to
convert into banks - as the Treasury has hinted it might - would provide an
escape route for those which found the straightjacket of regulation too
tight. The steady decline in the number of building societies - from almost
2,000 at the turn of the century to 105 today - might then have further to
go.

Despite the competition worries aired by the Office of Fair Trading, Mr
Michael Heseltine is clearly keen to avoid referring any of the television
sector bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It would, of course,
be extraordinary if he were to act otherwise, given that it was Mr Peter
Brooke who lifted the regulatory obstacles to industry consolidation.
Some fudge is therefore inevitable, and partial divestments may result.
Doubtless, the definition of the television advertising market will be
widened to include Channel 4 and satellite and cable. The Independent
Television Commission has already sketched a temporary solution, suggesting
that a combined Granada and LWT could own one advertising sales house and
half of another as long as strict Chinese walls were in place. That, though,
would hardly satisfy advertisers. Media buyers fear it would be difficult
for sales houses to remain truly independent  - especially as LWT's sales
house has been aggressively selling Yorkshire-Tyne Tees' air time against
Granada's.
One way to avoid conflicts of interest in advertising while permitting
consolidation of franchise ownership would be to force ITV companies to sell
sales houses to independent operators. That would also help clarify the real
worth of TV franchises. Publisher broadcasters, at least, would simply own
the right to a reasonably predictable fixed-term stream of income, dependent
on the level of original franchise bid. Whatever the precise value, it would
be nowhere near current bid levels.

Kingfisher's report on current trading disappointed those who had been
expecting a merry Christmas. But given the equity market's sunny
disposition, poor economic news is seen only as an opportunity for another
interest rate cut. While little will stop a market in such a gung-ho mood,
this focus on consumer confidence as a guide to interest rate movements may
be misleading. The Treasury, keen to maintain a broadly based recovery, and
mindful of the balance of payments, may well be paying more attention to
corporate investment intentions when deciding monetary policy.
That may mean that the consumer, who has led the recovery so far, will not
figure as prominently this year - particularly so when tax increases begin
to bite. The outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250 index also shows how
investor interest is focused on medium-sized capital goods companies and
away from the financial, utility and consumer dominated FT-SE 100 index.
High expectations for smaller companies are shown vividly by the rating of
35 times earnings on which the FT-SE SmallCap index is trading.
Still, that may not be wildly excessive given the much improved financial
position of companies. The earnings recovery required to sustain the market
may also be on the way. All of that is timely since interest rate cuts may
be slow in coming and gilts may have seen the best of the bull run. When
yields start to move up, attention may eventually shift to the long end of
the gilt market. The more fundamental support there is for equities, the
better underpinned they will be when the interest rate cycle turns.

FT  22 JAN 94 / M&amp;G faces criticism of executive option scheme: Move flouts
investor groups' corporate guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G Group, the UK's largest independent unit trust company, is facing
protests over a proposed executive share option scheme which some of its
institutional investors claim is against corporate governance principles.
The move is a potential embarrassment to M&amp;G, which, as a leading
institutional investor itself, has often taken a tough line on corporate
governance matters such as executive pay.
M&amp;G is asking shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on February 4
to approve a 10-year scheme that will allow executives to buy share options
at current market prices and exercise them after three years, providing the
share price rises. There are no minimum criteria on share price performance.
The move flouts recommendations from the UK's two largest shareholder
groups, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of
British Insurers, who want to limit executives' freedom to benefit from
options unless their company has genuinely improved its performance.
Both organisations have registered their objections with M&amp;G's directors.
M&amp;G has defended the scheme, saying that all forms of performance criteria
may be manipulated. Mr Anthony Ashplant, M&amp;G company secretary, said: 'We
think the market is more sophisticated than that and we think that the
market takes into account all the variables.
'Bearing in mind we are a large institutional investor ourselves, we thought
about the matter long and hard.'
Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the investment arm of
Britain's largest pension scheme and holder of a stake in M&amp;G, said: 'In
general, we prefer share options to reflect individual performance. And with
a fund management group particularly, you should not confuse a bull market
with genius.'
Despite opposition, though, fund managers believe it unlikely that M&amp;G will
be forced to alter terms of its proposed plan. Its single largest
shareholder, the Esmee Fairbairn Charitable Trust, set up by one of M&amp;G's
founders, Mr Ian Fairbairn, is thought likely to support it.
The issuance of share options to executives, sometimes at a discount of up
to 15 per cent to prevailing market prices, has allowed some executives to
earn what appear to be exorbitant salaries at a time when their companies
are performing poorly.
The NAPF and the ABI last June issued guidelines for boards of directors
saying share option schemes that did not contain performance criteria should
be rejected.
The NAPF in particular has urged that exercise of share options be limited
to companies whose share price has outperformed the market generally or the
sector specifically, irrespective of factors affecting the whole market.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Feltrim Names reject Lloyd's settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of any immediate settlement of the legal actions facing Lloyd's
of London faded further yesterday when loss-making Names on the Feltrim
syndicates voted overwhelmingly to reject the insurance market's Pounds 900m
settlement offer.
The Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market
 -are the third large group of loss-makers to turn down the offer in the
last two weeks.
Their rejection makes it unlikely that Lloyd's will assemble the 70 per cent
majority - by value of the offer - necessary for the settlement deal to be
declared unconditional next month. Without this, Lloyd's will face continued
legal actions.
Names' leaders believe that errors and omissions insurers, who cover Lloyd's
agents for negligence awards, would be able to fund improved compensation.
The 1,650 Feltrim Names taking legal action have been offered Pounds 237.5m
against losses to date of Pounds 599m. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the
Feltrim Names Association, described the amount as 'substantial' and
warranting 'serious consideration'.
However, the absence of any cap limiting Names' liability for losses still
to be reported was a 'structural deficiency'.
In addition, Names who agreed to the deal would give up their rights to take
legal action in the future. 'You will have no defence and be entirely at the
mercy of Lloyd's,' said Mr Hook.
The vast majority of about 1,000 Names at yesterday's meeting supported a
motion that the offer was not enough to 'outweigh the risks and
disadvantages of acceptance'.
Mr Hook estimated that by pursuing legal action the Feltrim Names could
obtain between Pounds 310m and Pounds 425m in damages.
'I have to believe that Lloyd's expects this offer to fail and have held
something back in reserve for obvious areas of improvement,' he said.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, said last week that the
offer was final.
Earlier this week, more than 1,000 Gooda Walker Names voted to reject the
offer by a majority of five to one.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Japan's ruling coalition fails to win backing for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan was plunged into political uncertainty yesterday when government plans
to reform the electoral system and curb corruption failed to win a majority
in the upper house of parliament.
The setback, after an unexpectedly large number of defections from the
ruling coalition, means Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, may now
have little option but to agree to the less radical alternative to his four
bills proposed by the opposition Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Tsutumo Hata, the foreign minister and leader of the coalition's
second-largest party, said: 'We're going to have to accept the opposition's
plan. We can't let this run and run.'
Failure to enact political reform would heighten public distrust of the
political process and damage Japan's international image, said Mr Takeshi
Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. Turmoil is
expected next week on the Tokyo stock market, which had risen recently on
hopes of government steps to boost the economy.
Mr Hosokawa said he would do his utmost to push a version of the four bills
through parliament by the end of the present session, January 29. He plans
to convene, early next week, a joint committee of the upper and lower houses
of parliament to negotiate a deal. 'I think there is room for compromise,'
he said.
But the chances of meeting the end of the month deadline are slim, meaning
that Mr Hosokawa will face pressure to resign should his reforms fall.
The vote is likely to provoke another realignment of political groups and
delay economic measures urgently needed to pull Japan out of recession.
Until yesterday, the government was planning to announce the measures early
next week.
Business leaders voiced dismay in spite of Mr Hosokawa's promise to publish
the pump-priming measures 'as quickly as possible.'
The upper house vote was to have been the final stage before the bills
became law after their adoption by the lower house.
However, 17 members of the Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest
but least dependable partner, defied their leaders' instructions and voted
against the government, driven by fears that the party would do worse under
the proposed electoral system than under present rules.
As a result, the government fell 12 votes short of a majority, by 130 votes
to 118. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist chairman, has hinted he will
resign.
The bills would scrap the present system of multi-seat constituencies for
the lower house and establish a mixture of proportional representation and
single-seat electoral districts. Donations to politicians would be banned.
Political reform has been under discussion since the 1988 Recruit scandal,
in which politicians received shares for favours.

FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclical stocks push Dow over
3,900
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Cyclical issues powered the bellwether US stock index over the 3,900 mark
for the first time yesterday, but the broader market sagged under the weight
of profit-taking and higher bond yields, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 22.52 ahead at 3,914.48,
but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ebbed 0.25 to 474.73. The secondary indices
were mixed, with the American SE composite slipping 0.07 to 484.74 and the
Nasdaq composite climbing 1.25 to an all-time high of 794.28.
Activity on the NYSE was heavy, with about 345m shares exchanged. Volume was
lifted by late trading related to the 'double witching' expiration of
options on individual issues and some stock indices.
Political uncertainty in Japan had little direct impact but an unfavourable
reaction in the bond market brought a restrained tone to early activity.
Late in the session, the yield of the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond had
edged up to 6.278 per cent amid concern that the failure of a reform package
to win parliamentary approval would cause Japanese investors to unload
securities.
On a day when no fresh economic data was scheduled for release, the
quarterly earnings of a few pivotal companies were in sharp focus. Most
notably, Caterpillar gave a big boost to the Dow when investors reacted
enthusiastically to its performance in the final reporting period. The stock
was marked up Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 98 5/8 , a new 52-week high, after
the heavy equipment maker announced net operating income of Dollars 1.46 a
share, against small loss a year earlier.
Other stocks whose performances are closely tied to macroeconomic trends
gave a lift to the blue-chip barometer, which topped 3,800 just two weeks
ago. Boeing climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 , improving on its
previous zenith, while Bethlehem Steel hit a new peak of Dollars 23 5/8 , up
Dollars 1 1/8 . 3M climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 112 3/8 and DuPont
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 . Some large-capitalisation computer stocks
somewhat offset the cyclicals' unflagging strength. Computer Associates shed
Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 38 in a further reaction to the company's
moderating growth in the last three months of 1993.
By contrast, new technology issues on the Nasdaq continued to rebound from
losses early in the week. Apple, up Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 33 3/8 , set
the tone after several Wall Street analysts upgraded the stock. At the close
of the previous session, the company posted a 75 per cent plunge in net
income.
Canada
Toronto stock prices closed sharply lower in busy trading, as plunging gold
and mining stocks helped fuel the retreat. The TSE-300 composite index
tumbled 40.44 points to close at 4,501.94.
The decline points to a market correction following the late-1993 rally that
carried strongly into 1994.

Brazilians equities closed flat in see-saw trading after a new wave of

FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): LVMH extends decline as Paris
slips back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were lower on balance, but seemed unaffected by the news from Japan,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS slipped back, having tested 2,260 at one point. The CAC-40 index
closed down 13.84 at 2,243.97, a week's loss of 0.8 per cent.
Turnover was FFr5.2bn. Investors continued to focus on LVMH following
Thursday's restructuring of its cross shareholdings with Guinness of the UK.
It weakened FFr50 to FFr3,849, some 5 per cent lower over the week. The
group commented yesterday that its sale of a 34 per cent stake in Moet
Hennessy to Guinness would help long-term profitability.
James Capel, sceptical about the group's strategy, commented that a further
de-rating of the stock could be expected, particularly as it had sold one of
its prized assets at the bottom of the cycle.
Among related issues Christian Dior gained FFr10 to FFr370 and Bon Marche
fell FFr15 to FFr720.
St Gobain was among the most active stocks after reporting better than
expected 1993 figures. The shares gained FFr46 or 7.4 per cent to FFr664,
with some switching out of Lafarge Coppee seen as the building materials
group lost FFr13.30 to FFr459.20.
Suez dropped FFr3.30 to FFr344.50 and had no comment to make on reports that
it might be considering the sale of its Groupe Victoire unit.
FRANKFURT's nervous depression was exaggerated by falling DAX futures prices
and selling on the DTB options expiry deadline. The DAX index closed 40.59
lower at 2,075.61, down 3.1 per cent on the week.
Turnover, inflated by the 'double-witching' in options and a large,
associated sell order from a foreign investment house, rose from DM9bn to
DM13.7bn.
The Ibis-indicated DAX eased only slightly in the post-bourse but Mr Jens
Wiecking, at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that there had been big
afternoon corrections, indicating US selling, three times in the last ten
days. In addition, he said, there was weakness in the bond market, with the
bund future breaking a medium term uptrend.
AMSTERDAM was swayed by technical factors on the expiry of futures and
options, and the AEX index closed the day up 3.54 at 428.42, a week's rise
of 1.8 per cent.
The major issues diverged widely with Royal Dutch, for example, rising Fl
1.90 to Fl 212.00 and Unilever down 70 cents at Fl 226.20.
Among the smaller issues, Sphinx, the sanitary ware and ceramic tile
manufacturer, added to Thursday's Fl 4.00 gain with a rise of Fl 4.50 to Fl
51.50, on news that it was to acquire Gustavsberg of Sweden, which operates
in the same sector.
MILAN picked up from early losses as domestic and foreign investors resumed
buying. The Comit index finished 4.10 lower at 613.61, for a 1.8 per cent
rise over the week.
Montedison added L31.40 to L996.50, in volume of 97.3m shares: this week's
huge volume figures have prompted speculation that one investor might be
building a hefty stake, although analysts note that many institutions are
rebuilding their holdings, having been short of the stock in recent months.
Insurers began lower, continuing the trend of recent days amid concerns
about delays in reimbursements from the state insurer INA. Generali picked
up late in the day to finish L380 higher at L38,470 and SAI was L115 higher
at L17,679.
ZURICH was easier before lower January inflation data for the city triggered
some buying during the afternoon. The SMI index finished down 6.6 at
3,039.3, 1.6 per cent higher on the week.
Oerlikon-Buhrle picked up SFr2.50 to SFr140 in response to its forecast of
higher 1993 profits after the market closed on Thursday.
STOCKHOLM rallied in late trading helped by strong overseas interest, but
the Affarsvarlden general index still lost 13.5 to 1,546.2, up 2.5 per cent
on the week, in turnover of SKr2.8bn.
Volvo B slipped another SKr10 to SKr634. After a firm share price rise since
December, the carmaker has been affected recently by worries over its long
term direction and, particularly, its relationship with Renault of France.
ATHENS recovered after the corrections of Wednesday and Thursday, the
general index rising 17.26, or 1.5 per cent higher at 1,149.37, up 3.9 per
cent on a volatile week.
ISTANBUL dropped 3.5 per cent amid profit-taking triggered by a surge in
short-term interest rates to prop up the lira. The composite index fell
951.94 to a provisional 26,072.92, down 9 per cent on the week.

FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Hangover for Germany after the party in
1993 - Prospects for Frankfurt equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's 46.7 per cent rise in Germany's DAX index was driven by hopes of
lower interest rates and the sheer weight of money looking for a home.
These hopes ensured that the market delivered its best performance since
1985. The climb was steeper than in 1989, when reunification euphoria
triggered a 35 per cent gain - and better in international terms than any
major market other than Hong Kong.
After the party comes the hangover, and the the cardinal question for 1994,
posed by Commerzbank in its review of investment opportunities for the
current year, is whether the German market will make a smooth transition
into a new phase of growth driven by earnings fundamentals.
On the basis of what has happened so far this year, such a smooth transition
is unlikely. The DAX has lost its momentum: having reached 2,266.68 on the
last trading day of 1993 it has sunk 8.4 per cent to close yesterday at
2,075.61
Underpinning the new mood of caution are at least three disappointments.
The first is that the Bundesbank is proving tiresomely slow in resuming its
interest cuts. Once again this week the Bundesbank failed to grasp the
opportunity to cut the discount and Lombard rates from the 5.75 and 6.75 per
cent levels established on October 22 last year. This compares to
expectations of a discount rate of 3.75 per cent by the end of the year -
expectations which are well discounted in current bund and equity prices.
The second is the fall-out from the Metallgesellschaft affair. The near
collapse of Germany's 14th largest industrial company has focused investors'
minds on the inadequacies of the German system of corporate control.
Foreign investors have placed their trust in the past in the German two-tier
board system, which reposes responsibility for monitoring management with
the supervisory board.
In Metallgesellschaft's case, an especially distinguished collection of
bankers and industrialists sitting on the group's supervisory board failed
to stop the oil-futures trading which helped lead to restated current and
potential losses of DM3.3bn, or around ten times the reported loss for
1992-93.
For international investors the affair poses disconcerting questions about
the level of control in place at other large German companies, many of which
are large conglomerates with myriad subsidiaries like Metallgesellschaft.
Also, given the scale of the accounting adjustment (which reflects
operational losses as well as the impact of the futures trading), it casts
further doubt on the reliability of German accounts.
The Metallgesellschaft example lends weight to the argument that German
accounting overstates a company's underlying operating performance during
economic downturn even if, when times are better, German accounts understate
what US or UK investors would understand as profits. When Daimler-Benz
published its accounts under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
conjunction with the listing of its shares in New York, it reported a
substantially higher loss than under German rules.
The third disappointment is that induced by Siemens' warning last week that
earnings for the current year will fall by between 10 and 15 per cent in the
current year, in spite of a rise in orders.
This was unexpected and has raised doubts about the soundness of earnings
forecasts for the many companies which will be reporting interim figures in
the second quarter of the year.
Add in the political uncertainty generated by the prospect of a multitude of
elections in Germany this year, and the three factors combine to make German
share prices look expensive, even after this month's correction.
According to Hoare Govett, the historic price earnings multiple for 1993 has
reached close to 40 times earnings whilst the prospective p/e for the
current year is at a record high of more than 25 times earnings. The London
broker predicts that total earnings for the German market will rise by 47
per cent this year, while the increase in some industrial sectors may be as
much as 76 per cent.
These increases reflect the consensus that the low-point of the German
downturn has been reached and that companies will this year start to reap
the benefits of their cost-cutting programmes. Hoare Govett does acknowledge
misgivings about a near 50 per cent rise in earnings against a backdrop of
modest economic growth - say an increase of 0.5 per cent in GDP this year -
misgivings that are likely to have been accentuated by the Siemens' warning.
Prospects are modest. A senior German fund manager says that investors can
look forward to a DAX level of 2,300-2,400 but refuses to commit himself to
say when. Accordingly, individual stock performance will play more of a role
this year than last.
Deutsche Bank Research likes car makers, capital goods and chemicals, whilst
underweighting banks and maintaining only a neutral commitment to the
insurance sector.
Hoare Govett, by contrast, underweights the automotive and metals sectors
and takes a neutral position in chemicals, consumer goods, utilities and
engineering.

Gold shares tumbled 5.8 per cent as the bullion price fell after reports of
the discovery of 1,200 tons of gold belonging to the former Philippines
president Ferdinand Marcos. The index shed 120 to 1,943 as Vaal Reefs fell
R15 to R422.00, Western Deep shed R13.50 to R159.50 and Freegold was R5.25
lower at R65.00. Industrials added 8 to 5,483 in slow trade as the market
found mild support, but lacked any clear direction. The overall index lost
70 to 4,785.

FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Misplaced optimism lifts
Nikkei 1.8%
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism over the political reform bill's passage through the upper house
pushed up share prices during the session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
However, worries over the economy emerged following the bill's defeat after
the market had closed, and traders are bracing themselves for a rush of
selling next week. This was reflected in trading in London where the
ISE/Nikkei index fell 36.89 to 1,256.58. The Nikkei index closed up 123.51
at 19,307.43, a week's rise of 1.8 per cent, after moving within a tight
range of 19,065.81 and 19,337.93. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 19.12 to 1,569.91.
Domestic institutions were on the selling side while foreign investors
continued to buy. Volume was 450m shares against 561m. Gainers led losers by
633 to 424 with 130 issues unchanged.
While the rejection of the bill by the upper house was not ruled out most
investors had remained hopeful. Towards the end of the session, buying led
by arbitrageurs pushed up the index.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone posted its 17 straight rise, advancing
Y25,000 to Y880,000. East Japan Railway, another benchmark issue for market
sentiment, gained Y5,000 to Y496,000.
Banks were higher on buying by foreign investors who are looking to increase
their weightings in the sector ahead of next month's launch of the Nikkei
300 futures, which is heavily weighted in the sector.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 71.22 to 21,074.78 in volume of 43.7m shares.
Roundup
Variations were seen in performance among the region's markets yesterday.
Bombay was closed after a strike in the city was called by a right wing
political group.
TAIWAN improved some 2.3 per cent up after a recovery in the financial
sector encouraged late buying.
The weighted index added 135.22 to 5,944.87, for a week's gain of 3.5 per
cent. Turnover eased slightly to TDollars 64.8bn from Thursday's TDollars
65.1bn.
Textile companies were among the day's best performers with analysts
expecting a turnaround in the sector helped by the threefold rise in
polyester fibre prices since last November.
HONG KONG overcame a weak start to end sharply higher after selective buying
pushed prices up in thin turnover. The Hang Seng index closed 194.53 or 1.7
per cent higher at 11,459.37, after dropping more than 135 points shortly
after the opening.
Turnover shrank to HKDollars 7.65bn from a heavy HKDollars 11.77bn on
Thursday.
Futures surged, with January Hang Seng index contracts erasing their steep
discount with a 490-point jump to 11,500.
SINGAPORE picked up on renewed buying by some institutional funds. The
Straits Times Industrials index rose 22.45 or 1 per cent to 2,281.73, for a
0.9 per cent fall on the week.
Malaysia's Promet, the most active share, ended unchanged at SDollars 1.85
after a day's high of SDollars 1.94.
SEOUL closed a roller-coaster session lower after profit-taking in blue
chips outweighed selective buying of low-priced shares. The composite index
closed 8.09 lower at 870.20, comfortably off a day's high of 881.60, and 1
per cent lower on the week.
Daiwoo, regarded as undervalued, saw the largest trading volume. The stock
went limit up Won800 to Won16,700 in volume of 1.3m shares.
Profits were taken in companies involved in the first and second mobile
telecom bids ahead of Monday's auction of Korea Mobile Telecom shares. Both
Sunkyong Industries and Kolon Industries went limit-down, losing Won1,300
each to Won35,600 and Won36,100 respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on bargain hunting and renewed foreign buying. The
composite index recouped 13.74 of the 60 points lost in the previous two
days to finish at 1,063.76, but was still 6.3 per cent lower over the week.
AUSTRALIA ended the week lower as some investors took profits. The All
Ordinaries index lost 15.9 at 2,250.3, up 2 per cent on the week. Turnover
ADollars 627.6m.
ANZ rose 6 cents to ADollars 5.27 after reporting satisfactory first quarter
results.

FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Redland strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building materials group Redland was one of the FT-SE 100's best performers,
the shares rising 23 to 622p, after stories that the shares were being given
a strong push by Cazenove, the company's own stockbroker. Cazenove wields
immense influence in the stockmarket but adheres strictly to a long-standing
policy of not commenting on its corporate and agency broking activities
'There has been some persistent and sizeable demand for Redland shares,'
said one building sector specialist, who added that the share price may well
have been pushed ahead by recent market stories that a series of Europe-wide
interest rate cuts could be in the pipeline.
A quiet day in pharmaceuticals was dominated by a positive trading statement
from Zeneca, up 10 to 818p. 'Not a dramatic bit of news' was how one analyst
described it, although others were more complimentary; Mr Nigel Barnes at
Hoare Govett said Zeneca and Glaxo, flat at 661p, were the only two stocks
that were still attractive in terms of yield. 'The rest of the sector has
been looking a bit tired,' he said.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' shares were up 4 at 436p, little affected by
NatWest's Securities issue of 50m warrants. Mr Nick Conington at NatWest
said that over the long term, the stock appeared undervalued. 'It's too
early to call the stock a buy - we have to wait and see,' he said.
Among supermarket groups, Park Food saw improved sales and earnings and the
shares climbed 3 to 294p, after touching 303p. The majors were weak on a
combination of profit-taking and lingering concerns over the industry's
direction in the wake of Tesco's trading statement this week. The company
cut its capital expenditure, made provisions for property write-downs and
signalled its intention to grow dividends, in the face of continuing margin
pressure. How market leader J Sainsbury will respond to the Tesco move is
the question being pondered in food retail circles, and it was concern over
this that saw the shares come off 11 to 460p. Tesco fell 5 to 243 1/2 p.
Food manufacturers were subdued, although Hazlewood declined 5 to 174p on
talk of poor Christmas sales.
Stores were mixed although Great Universal Stores surged 16 to 629p amid a
market rumour of an impending warrant to be issued by a leading securities
house. Talk of healthy margins at Marks and Spencer underpinned the shares,
up 7 1/2 at 459 1/2 p. WH Smith jumped 16 to 545p ahead of results next
week, while MFI Furniture, also reporting, slipped 1 1/2 to 167p. Despite
market talk of weak margins over Christmas, brokers close to the company are
confident of profits above the average of market forecasts. The range is
Pounds 18-25m.
Shares in business services group Inchcape, moved sharply ahead after Robert
Fleming reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The move follows
Thursday's recommendation from US investment bank Goldman Sachs and the
shares jumped 34 to 589p, on volume of 2.9m. Mr Mike Smith at Fleming said
the stock had been left behind due to uncertainty about trading at Gestetner
in which it has a 15 per cent stake and nerves about next Thursday's trading
update. Gestetner closed 12 ahead at 171p, following favourable comment on
its results.
European demand continued for British Steel following a Credit Lyonnais
recommendation earlier this week. The shares hardened 1 1/2 to 128 1/2 p as
turnover soared to 27m.

FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Standard surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upsurge in Standard Chartered shares continued unabated, with many
brokers, but few marketmakers, taken aback by the speed of the latest
upsurge. 'The marketmakers remain acutely short of stock and until this is
unwound and the mistaken bid stories dissipate, the shares will continue to
move up,' said one long-standing observer of the company.
Standard is due to report preliminary results on March 9 and is expected by
shrewd market observers to achieve pre-tax profits close to the top of the
range, said to be between Pounds 360m and Pounds 450m.
Talk of stakebuilding and bid stories are still regarded by the leading
marketmakers as wide of the mark. Lloyds Bank, which retains a near 5 per
cent from its mid-1980's tilt at the Standard, and at least one of the big
Swiss banks, are said to have taken a hard and long look at Standard, who's
Pacific Rim and African interests are the envy of the international banking
community.
Standard shares rocketed to a record 1360p, up 44 on the day and a massive
198 higher on the week. Turnover yesterday reached 1.5m shares. NatWest
Securities was a strong supporter of Standard yesterday; 'Standard has
underperformed by 3 per cent over the month, is trading on less than 10
times 1994 earnings and will see a sharp rise in both dividend cover and
balance sheet ratios,' the broker said yesterday.

The predatory television stocks, Granada and Carlton Communications, rallied
on the news that their respective bids would not be referred to the MMC
providing certain undertakings were met. The afternoon announcement caused
some confusion, with Carlton's shares - already marked down on the day
through profit-taking - dipping to 986 at one point before the company said
it had already indicated its willingness to give such undertakings. Shares
recovered to finish down 12 at 1006p, while Granada moved up 16 to 591p. LWT
were up 11 to 699p and Central down 50 to 3065p.
Elsewhere profit-taking knocked Reuters back 27 to 1897p and EMAP lost 9 to
close at 465p. Reed and Pearson were slightly stronger on the day, closing
at 902p, up 6, and 640p, up 6, respectively.

FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: New peaks on the Footsie following
GDP data - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market put its hopes of an early base rate cut back on the
shelf yesterday and moved to new peaks after the latest data on gross
domestic product, money supply and bank lending data indicated further
strengthening in the domestic economy. The FT-SE Index, led by the stock
index market, challenged the 3,500 mark to establish a new trading high
before closing 14.2 up on the day at 3,484.2.
The announcement that GDP had grown by 0.7 per cent over the final quarter
of last year brought a confident response from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, who repeated his budget forecast that the UK
economy will expand by 2.5 per cent this year.
Equities were uncertain at first, in spite of a firm performances overnight
in Far Eastern markets and on Wall Street. Second line stocks traded more
calmly as the interest returned to the Footsie, futures-related stocks.
Satisfaction with the economic data was quickly reflected in the futures
market where the March contract on the Footsie raced above the 3,500 mark
again. The FT-SE Index itself turned from its early fall of nearly 7 points
to touch 3,496.1, for a net rise of more than 26 points.
But the futures contract came off, and that proved to be the peak of the day
for share prices, although a firm start to the new session on Wall Street,
when the Dow Average broke through 3,900, buoyed London at the close.
The FT-SE 100 Share Index has risen by 183.6 points, or about 2.5 per cent
this week in good turnover. Seaq volume slipped to 979.7m shares, still at
the higher end of daily averages for the past 18 months. On Thursday, Seaq
volume of 1.1bn shares returned a retail worth of Pounds 2.53bn, around
twice recent daily averages.
But much of the excitement at mid-week came from the massive rise on the Mid
250 Index which has gained nearly 5 per cent since last Friday. Investors
have been buying Mid 250 stocks because they are on lower rating than the
blue chips which captured the buying interest in the dramatic advance in the
stock market before Christmas.
London was helped by strength in the leading oil stocks, on the back of US
markets, and by another round of substantial gains in stocks linked to Far
Eastern markets.
Traders said that buyers were highly stock selective, and are now shying
away from the highly rated blue chip stocks which are on prospective
earnings multiples of 25 times.
Base rate hopes were resurrected this week after news that retail sales
dipped last month, but the London market has been discouraged by the absence
of any move from the Bundesbank. The president of the German central bank
said yesterday that it appeared right to hold interest rate policy 'steady'
for now.
Although confidence on UK inflation prospects remains high, bonds slipped
lower yesterday as prices were readjusted at the end of a very successful
week for the sector. Short-dated issues recorded small losses, with the
longer end down by around  1/4 of a point. Index-linked followed the trend
of the long dated conventional government bonds.
Overseas and domestic demand for gilts, which has sustained the market this
week, was reduced yesterday although the GDP and money supply data was
regarded as within the bracket of market estimates.

FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expiry of the index options was the day's main feature in the
derivatives sector leading to strong volumes in both the index futures and
traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,486 and
promptly went into retreat as independent traders sold stock
The release of favourable GDP figures prompted strong buying of March, said
to have been led by UBS and Monument. A large part of the demand was due to
technical reasons ahead of the mid-morning expiry of the Index options and
it sent March crashing through the 3,500 barrier to peak at 3,517
March drifted for the rest of the session and finished at 3,490 on hefty
volume of 20,421 contracts.
Unwinding of positions as the index options expired brought closing turnover
of 52,913 contracts of which 20,165 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and
13,603 in the Euro FT-SE 100.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday gained strength across the board against major
currencies with the market anticipating the release next week of favourable
US economic data, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar fell earlier on fears that Japanese political turmoil might
jeopardise implementation of an economic stimulus package and prompt US
calls for a stronger Yen to narrow the trade gap between the two countries.
London dealers reported frantic early European trading, mainly the result of
position squaring among players who were long on dollars and short on yen.
After closing at Y111.510 in London on Thursday, the dollar fell to Y109.75
in early trading before recovering robustly as US investors bought the
currency at lower levels when they entered the market. It finished only
slightly lower than Thursday at Y111.210.
Commenting on the dollar's strength, Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ
International in London said: 'The focus next week will be on US growth
prospects and the numbers that are in prospect look like they are going to
be on the strong side.' Another view in the market was that with the outlook
for a fiscal stimulus to the Japanese economy having been removed by the
latest political setbacks, a monetary boost through a cut in interest rates
had become more likely.
The dollar was also supported by rumours that an important financier had
bought large amounts of dollars for yen and D-Marks.
Dealers were looking forward to tomorrow's meeting between US Treasury
secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen and Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa
and finance minister Mr Hirohisa Fujii for further clues as to the way the
dollar and yen will move.
The market yesterday appeared to reconsider the significance of the
Bundesbank's Thursday announcement cutting the minimum reserve requirements
of banks. After strengthening nearly a pfennig on Thursday against the
dollar to close in London at DM1.7358, the German unit yesterday gave up its
gains to close at DM1.7474. It also closed weaker in London against
sterling, finishing at DM2.6122 compared to Thursday's close of DM2.6029.
Analysts said that although the Bundesbank was clearly trying to ease
monetary conditions without cutting rates, the market had taken the view
that rate-cuts would not be delayed. Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer
said that it was right to hold Bundesbank policy steady for now, but that it
would not hold rates at current levels for longer than necessary.
Sterling struggled to make real headway yesterday despite an encouraging
batch of UK economic data. Fourth quarter 1993 GDP rose 0.7 per cent to give
a year-on-year rise of 2.5 per cent, slightly higher than forecast. December
bank and building society lending rose a higher than expected Pounds 4.1bn
while the M4 measure of broad money grew a provisional 5.5 per cent in the
year to December. Although the pound closed stronger against the D-Mark, it
weakened against the dollar in London to Dollars 1.495 from Thursday's close
of Dollars 1.4996. Traders said its subdued performance was a natural
correction following its recent appreciation. Dealers said it remains well
underpinned by solid UK fundamentals and speculation that Germany will relax
monetary policy in the coming weeks.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with late assistance of
Pounds 80m after earlier providing Pounds 2.256bn liquidity to the system.
The revised forecast of the liquidity shortage was Pounds 2.35bn.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Aluminium talks fail to
lift cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointment at the failure of leading aluminium producing countries to
reach agreement on curbing oversupply left the metal's prices at a low ebb
on the London Metal Exchange yesterday.
The three months delivery price had risen by nearly Dollars 12 to Dollars
1,217.50 a tonne on Monday in anticipation of the producers' meeting, which
was scheduled to run for two days and was widely expected to result in a
multilateral agreement to cut world aluminium production by about 10 per
cent - 1.5m-2m tonnes. Most of that rise was lost after the talks began in
Brussels on Tuesday, however, as a total news blackout left traders groping
in the dark.
Further modest losses were registered during the second day, partly in
response to indications that Russia, the main source of a flood of aluminium
into the west since the collapse of the Soviet Union, was proving determined
not to shift from its opening offer. Hopes were rekindled, however, by news
that the talks were to continue on Thursday. 'We decided we would keep
talking while we were still making progress,' said one delegate.
The apparent confidence of delegates at the opening of the third day of
negotiations further revived LME dealers' spirits and three months aluminium
bounced to Dollars 1,214 a tonne in the morning. However, the sight of
decidedly grimmer faces emerging for the midday recess brought an abrupt
turnaround in market sentiment and the price fell back to Dollars 1,186.75
at the close.
But the optimists were not done. Yesterday morning's announcement that there
would be a midday statement sent the price to Dollars 1,218 a tonne, only to
fall all the way back to Dollars 1,189 at the close, down Dollars 16.25 on
the week, after the announcement simply said that the talks would continue,
possibly over the weekend. Further negotiations will have to be conducted by
telephone and fax, however, as most of the delegates, including the
Russians, have gone home.
Disappointment with the Brussels talks cast a shadow over other LME
contracts yesterday, but copper and lead still ended the week with
substantial gains.
Copper's early strength seemed to be entirely due to speculative activity,
traders said, but lead benefitted towards the end of the week from reports
of increased replacement car battery demand in the US as a result of the
recent extreme cold in the eastern half of the country.
At the London bullion market the gold market held its own until taking a
tumble yesterday. Chart-inspired selling helped to push the price down to
Dollars 385.25 a troy ounce yesterday, off Dollars 7.05 on the day and
Dollars 4.75 on the week. Dealers dismissed any link between the weakness of
gold in London and New York with a television programme claiming that 1,240
tonnes of gold had been stored by Ferdinand Marcos, the late Philippines'
dictator, in Switzerland.
'The market was lethargic and had been all week. It wanted to go down and
needed an excuse,' one analyst told the Reuter news agency. 'This got blown
out of all proportion.'
At the London Commodity Exchange coffee was a big loser in midweek, when the
March futures position fell to Dollars 1,168 a tonne at one stage. But it
staged a partial rally on Thursday following Brazil's announcement that it
would roll-over producer debts, against which it is holding coffee as
collateral, removing the immediate threat of that coffee reaching the open
market.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swedish forestry sell-off aims
to raise SKr7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday launched its biggest ever privatisation, saying it hoped to
raise up to SKr7bn (Dollars 860m) from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in
the state forestry group, AssiDoman.
The government is offering 53.5m shares in the company, which is the fourth
largest Swedish pulp and paper group and one of the top 10 in Europe.
Unlike previous privatisation issues, this one will largely be directed at
the Swedish public. They will be offered 70 per cent of the shares, with the
balance being sold to foreign and domestic institutions. Foreign
institutions will be allowed to buy a maximum of 8m shares, equivalent to 7
per cent of the whole company.
Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's industry minister, said latest estimates showed
AssiDoman was worth between SKr10bn and SKr14bn.
The offer price will be fixed on March 9 on the basis of bids submitted by
institutions in the preceding days. The public offer will take place between
March 9 and March 21, while first dealings on the Stockholm stock exchange
are planned for April 8.
In adopting the proposed ownership structure and pricing mechanism, the
government hopes to avoid a repeat of the criticism which followed last
year's sell-off of defence group Celsius. Then the public share offer was 17
times oversubscribed.
AssiDoman has annual sales of SKr13bn and is Sweden's largest forest owner
and its biggest producer of sawn timber products. The state will retain a 51
per cent stake in the group.
AssiDoman intends to bid for Ncb, another Swedish forestry group, following
its partial privatisation. The terms of the offer, to be launched between
March 25 and April 22, have already been accepted by the government which
holds 51 per cent of Ncb.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Westinghouse sees weak earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of Westinghouse Electric, repeated warnings of
weak earnings in the first quarter of this year as the troubled US
conglomerate reported figures for the last quarter of 1993.
He said: 'We believe the first-quarter 1994 earnings will be down
substantially compared to the first quarter of 1993, primarily due to
increased pension expense, reduced licensee income, and a one-time
accounting change for nuclear fuel in 1993.'
The latest figures were weighed down by previously announced pre-tax charges
of Dollars 750m, marking an attempt by Mr Jordan, who joined the group last
summer, to strengthen the group's operating position.
At the operating level, Westinghouse made a loss of Dollars 328m in the
final three months of the year on sales of Dollars 2.6bn, compared with a
profit of Dollars 160m on sales of Dollars 2.5bn the year before.
The loss per share was Dollars 1.38 (Dollars 1.11 on continuing operations).
A year before, the company made a profit of 18 cents per share (a loss of
Dollars 3.74 a share after taking into account Dollars 1.4bn losses on
discontinued operations).
The company gave no breakdown of its various operating units in the latest
period, though it repeated earlier comments that both revenues and operating
profits at its environmental businesses were down 'substantially' in the
quarter.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Volvo gets back to nuts and
bolts - The new chairman of Sweden's car maker talks to Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to imagine a greater contrast to Pehr Gyllenhammar than Bert-Olof
Svanholm.
Volvo's newly installed chairman, elected this week to lead Sweden's top
manufacturer following the fiasco of the failed merger with Renault, is a
physically compact engineer, virtually unknown outside industrial circles
who is most animated when talking about the nuts and bolts of making a
company function efficiently.
This, clearly, is a very different character from Mr Gyllenhammar, the suave
lawyer who in 22 years at the top of Volvo gave the company enviable
international cachet and became one of the best-known and most-admired men
in Sweden.
Mr Svanholm, head of the Nordic operation of Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Swedish engineering group, considers his words carefully when asked
what kind of leadership he will bring to Volvo.
'My interest is not so much the national/global aspect of business as
perhaps Mr Gyllenhammar has shown. I am very much a team player, working
with the people, working with management, trying together with my colleagues
on the board to achieve company improvements in all areas,' he says.
'We are all aware that the car industry is one of the most competitive
businesses. Therefore a lot of attention will have to be paid not only to
the structural measures and the alliance with Renault, but to a very great
extent on cost improvements inside the company, from the balance sheet point
of view down to factory efficiency.'
Mr Svanholm quickly uses the three letters BMT - meaning 'before my time' -
to avoid direct comment on the dramatic events that led to his appointment.
But there is a clear message that he intends to do things differently and
ensure there is no repeat of the drama when shareholders harbouring
long-term resentments over Mr Gyllenhammar's autocratic rule over Volvo
finally revolted by rejecting his plan to merge with Renault.
First, Mr Svanholm will not work full time, or have any executive role, at
Volvo, as Mr Gyllenhammar did. 'It is important that Volvo now gets a
division between the management and the board,' he says.
Second, he sees a closer role for shareholders in plotting the company's
course.
'If things are going to be moved in a thorough way in a company it is of
course crucial that communication is floating freely through the system -
within the company, from the company to the board, from the board to
shareholders.'
If the choice of Mr Svanholm was initially a surprise, these attitudes
explain his attraction to the cabal of Swedish institutional shareholders
who precipitated the downfall of Mr Gyllenhammar and who chose him as the
successor.
His lack of a public profile or any reputation for glory seeking, combined
with a workman-like record in an engineering blue-chip as solid as ABB make
him a safe pair of hands. The big question is whether he will prove
sufficiently well-equipped to lead a company which faces severe long-term
industrial challenges and which carries the unusual but unavoidable burden
of the high expectations of the wider Swedish public.
What most Swedes want to see is Volvo firmly committed to an independent
future making cars.
Mr Svanholm has been understandably reticent about talking publicly about
strategy until he and the new board, together with Mr Soren Gyll, the chief
executive, and his management team, have worked out in detail what the
direction should be.
Top of the list is what to do about the three-year old alliance with Renault
now the merger plan is scrapped. The whole structure of the relationship,
from cross-shareholdings to joint purchasing arrangements, is under review.
Volvo must also decide how many of its interests outside the core truck and
car operations - which run from aero engines, through food and drinks to
pharmaceuticals - it wants or can afford to retain.
At this stage, Mr Svanholm gives little clue as to what his preferred
outcome is.
But there is a clear indication of what his regime may bring in one
important area of substance - organisational structures within Volvo.
His conversation becomes liveliest when talking about the projects he has
presided over at ABB to improve productivity and cost cutting.
He proudly points out that the so-called T50 project has in three years cut
throughput times at ABB Sweden by 47 per cent. He vigorously defends as
'very close to my heart' efforts made by Mr Gyllenhammar to introduce more
worker-friendly production techniques at Volvo.
'We are at a stage of paradigm change where we are leaving the functional
thinking behind and moving into process-oriented, flow-oriented
organisation, utilising the whole person - not just his arms and legs - and
thereby getting fantastic productivity improvement.'
Sweden, with its history of close co-operation between management and trade
unions, is well placed to achieve these changes, Mr Svanholm says. He talks
of 'taking out the wording of blue and white collar workers' to achieve a
'new Swedish model'. 'If I can contribute some of those ideas into Volvo, I
will be happy,' he says.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banesto fights for Portuguese
bank stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Espanol de Credito's new board has begun a concerted effort to keep
its controversial 50 per cent holding in Banco Totta e Acores, the big
Portuguese bank, following warnings from Lisbon that half its stake may have
been accumulated illegally.
Mr Alfredo Saenz, acting president of Banesto, and Mr Miguel Martin, deputy
governor of the Bank of Spain, met Mr Eduardo Catroga, the Portuguese
finance minister, yesterday in the hope of defusing a growing row in
Portugal.
This is centred on the apparent infringement by the former Banesto
management, which was dismissed by the Bank of Spain on December 28, of
rules governing the stakes foreigners may hold in Portugal's privatised
banks.
This month Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former president, announced that
Banesto holds 25 per cent of BTA directly and a further 25 per cent
indirectly. The size of the shareholding contravenes Portuguese legislation
limiting foreign ownership of BTA to 25 per cent.
The talks in Lisbon were expected to focus on a 'non-aggression pact' under
which Portuguese authorities would not force Banesto to sell the 25 per cent
of BTA it is believed to hold illegally. In return, Banesto would agree not
to call in loans totalling an estimated Es50bn (Dollars 286m) it has
extended to Portuguese shareholders of BTA.
Mr Saenz, who believes Banesto's purchase of BTA was the soundest of all of
the Portuguese acquisitions by Spanish banks in recent years, has been
shaken by the possibility that Banesto may be forced to lose control of
Totta.
Banesto made loans to Portuguese companies in which the Spanish bank has a
minority stake and the money was used to buy shares in BTA during the bank's
privatisation. This enabled Banesto to increase its indirect holding in BTA
above the 25 per cent it holds directly.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar result boosts shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Caterpillar, the US heavy plant and machinery maker, continued
their upward surge yesterday as the company reported another quarter of
strong recovery. They added Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 96 5/8 by midday.
Fourth-quarter losses of Dollars 2m the previous year turned into after-tax
profits of Dollars 148m this time, or Dollars 119m after an extraordinary
loss of Dollars 29m for the early retirement of some high interest rate
debt.
Earnings per share were Dollars 1.46 before the extraordinary item and
Dollars 1.17 after it, compared with a loss per share of 2 cents last time.
Caterpillar's share price has nearly doubled over the last year in response
to the sharp recovery in the company's financial performance.
Its profits are strongly linked to the economic cycle because its equipment
sells best when public and private sectors are spending on construction and
expansion.
The biggest single factor behind the latest quarter's turnround was a 16 per
cent increase in turnover to Dollars 3.2bn, with three-quarters of the
increase coming from higher physical sales and the other quarter from better
prices.
Nearly all the improvement took place in the US, where economic growth
stimulated demand. Volumes outside the US were more or less flat.
For the year as a whole, Caterpillar recorded a 14 per cent increase in
sales to Dollars 11.2bn, with higher demand from US industry more than
offsetting moderate declines in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin
America.
Net profits were Dollars 681m excluding the fourth-quarter's extraordinary
loss of Dollars 29m. Last year the company lost Dollars 218m, or Dollars
2.4bn after a Dollars 2.2bn charge for accounting changes.
Higher demand world-wide is expected to bring further profits growth this
year.

FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Degussa trims board at end of
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Degussa, the Frankfurt-based metals and chemicals group, is to round off its
two-year restructuring and decentralisation programme by thinning top
management.
The board is to be reduced from eight to six members, and the
responsibilities of two second-tier executives are to be taken over by the
main board.
Mr Henning Bode, 53, and Mr Alexander Mentz, 49, will leave the board at the
end of the current financial year in September.
Mr Bode's responsibilities for technical matters, including quality and
engineering, will in future be spread around the group's operating
divisions. The responsibility for base metals, formerly Mr Mentz's job, will
be taken on by Mr Gunter Wohlenberg, the main board member already in charge
of precious metals.
Degussa's interests in non-precious metals will be considerably reduced on
completion of the sale, agreed last year, of its Leybold subsidiary to
Oerlikon-Buehrle of Switzerland.
A company spokesman could not say whether the departing directors would
remain with the company.
Other changes include the main board assuming control over the industry and
speciality chemicals division and the inorganic chemicals business currently
headed by Mr Fritz Hahn and Mr Heinrich Wolf, both 60, and who will retire
at the end of the financial year.
The Degussa management, which yesterday announced an unchanged dividend of
DM7 for 1992-1993, has been widely praised for the efficiency and speed of
its rationalisation plans.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Midland Independent plans March flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail
and the Coventry Evening Telegraph, has decided on a March Stock Exchange
flotation.
The MIN board is believed to have taken the decision yesterday and an
announcement is expected next week.
The decision to go ahead with the flotation makes it very likely that Sir
Norman Fowler, chairman of the newspaper group, will give up the
chairmanship of the Conservative party later this year to concentrate on his
business career.
A chairman of a publicly quoted company is unable to be a Cabinet member.
Sir Norman has committed himself to MIN for the forseeable future and he is
therefore expected to give up the party chairmanship after the local and
European elections.
It is unclear exactly how much of the company, taken over from Mr Ralph
Ingersoll by a management buy-out team led by Mr Chris Oakley in 1991, is
going to be sold but it is likely to be between 30 per cent and 40 per cent.
Since the purchase, for Pounds 125m, the company has been expanding
throughout the Midlands.
The flotation should make paper millionaires of the management team of six
who organised the buy-out.
The group publishes a total of 31 newspapers and a number of weekly
specialist titles and regional magazines. In the six months to June it made
operating profits of Pounds 7.8m on turnover of Pounds 37.7m.
Turnover for the full year will probably top Pounds 70m.
MIN has been considering going to the market for some time but was holding
off because of uncertainties over the government's attitude to VAT on
newspapers.
Setting aside interest charges flowing from the original purchase, MIN has
nearly trebled operating profit in the period since Mr Ingersoll sold the
business.
The group's four main paid-for titles are the Birmingham Post, the Sunday
Mercury, the Birmingham Evening Mail and the Coventry Evening Telegraph.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Keeping the European dream alive - The
challenges facing Charterhouse following its change of ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While optimistic by nature, Mr Victor Blank does not overstate the chance of
him heading the first true pan-European merchant bank. 'That is the vision,
but I do not suppose it will happen in my working lifetime,' says
51-year-old Mr Blank.
Charterhouse, of which Mr Blank is chief executive, is now taking the first
steps. It is in the first weeks under the 90 per cent ownership of Credit
Commercial de France and Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank. The
remaining 10 per cent is held by its former owner, Royal Bank of Scotland.
Mr Blank's vision for his medium-sized City merchant bank is for it to form
the investment banking arm of its French and German parents while drawing on
its British roots. But for the foreseeable future, it will remain a UK bank
operating with the support, and partial direction of its shareholders.
Transforming Charterhouse will be a tough task. It does not have the capital
strength and breadth of leading UK investment banks such as Schroders or SG
Warburg. It has also suffered from a prolonged period of uncertainty over
its ownership since the possibility of a sale emerged two years ago.
Some of Charterhouse's competitors believe that it no longer has the power
of the mid-1980s when it carved out a niche in mergers and acquisitions. 'I
think they have rather withered on the vine, and the uncertainty over who
owned them has been quite damaging,' says one rival corporate financier.
Mr Blank's European vision is superficially attractive. It draws on some of
the same logic that persuaded Deutsche Bank to acquire Morgan Grenfell in
1989. He hopes to attract cross-border advisory work from medium-sized
companies of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 1bn market capitalisation.
But Charterhouse has a lot to prove. Royal Bank lost Pounds 35.1m in selling
the 90.1 per cent stake, including the writing-off of Pounds 23.1m goodwill.
Profits for 1993 were only Pounds 20.2m - the same as two years ago -
although the figure would have been higher but for Royal Bank's disposal
accounting.
Mr Blank is undisturbed by such unpropitious omens, arguing that the bank is
finally capable of pursuing a clear strategy. 'We didn't have the size to go
it alone, but we have set a marker. If any of our peer group think they can
simply operate from these shores, they are barmy.'
He thought of seeking European partners three years ago, when the mergers
and acquisitions boom of the 1980s was ebbing. The bank had made a name for
innovations - including several management buy-outs - but needed to find
ways of developing its corporate finance and venture capital businesses.
Commercial banks that bought investment banks in the 1980s acquired a
reputation of managing them badly because they did not understand the
deal-making culture. But Mr Blank believed that Royal Bank, far from
crushing Charterhouse by trying to integrate it crudely, had not made the
most of it.
Charterhouse thought that it should take charge of some of Royal Bank's
corporate relationships so that it could add its advisory and capital
markets services to Royal Bank's lending; it could not agree the idea with
its parent, however, and so asked for leave to seek an alternative strategy.
This eventually led it to the deal with CCF and BHF. The French bank already
had a significant merchant banking arm in its domestic market, but was
looking to expand into London. The German bank wanted a way of learning some
corporate advisory techniques alien to its home market.
Mr Blank thinks that BHF benefits by watching Charterhouse and other City
institutions at work. 'Merchant banking is a less sophisticated activity
there. I think it was important for them to invest in London to acquire the
skills they are going to need in their own market place,' he says.
For CCF, the acquisition is more a means of establishing a London presence.
Mr Jean Christian Metz, the CCF director on Charterhouse's management board,
says it could not simply establish a subsidiary. 'You can never grow as fast
in a country like Britain starting from scratch,' he says.
For the moment, the most obvious day-to-day effect of the change of
ownership is a video conferencing link established between London, Paris and
Frankfurt to encourage a flow of information. Mr Blank says that the links
mean that 'many times a day, people talk business to each other'.
Even joined together, the three institutions may find it difficult to
compete with more powerful rivals. These include not only Lazard Freres in
Paris and Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt but US investment banks such as Goldman
Sachs. Mr Blank says such powerful competition stimulates innovation.
'If you do not have a client list like Schroders, then you have got to have
creative ideas,' he says. He believes that Charterhouse can carve a similar
niche advising medium-sized companies that are looking overseas, similar to
that which it achieved in the last decade in domestic buy-outs.
As he admits, there is limited evidence after only a few weeks under new
ownership. Charterhouse still has to work to show that its vision of
pan-European merchant bank is more practical than other European dreams. Mr
Blank will have plenty for which to strive in his working lifetime.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EGM agrees new financial flexibilty for
Kalamazoo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalamazoo Trust, the traditional majority holder of the equity in Kalamazoo,
the computer services and printing systems company, yesterday agreed to the
erosion of its control at an extraordinary meeting in Birmingham.
Directors of the company, given new financial flexibility, are now likely to
make acquisitions of computer services companies in continental Europe. One
purchase will probably be completed shortly.
The Trust, once known as the Kalamazoo Workers' Alliance, has held 51.5 per
cent of the company's equity on behalf of the employees since 1971. It was
set up in 1948 by the Morland and Impey families and endowed with 39 per
cent of the equity. The original purpose was for the employees eventually to
obtain outright control.
The employees' equity is now likely to be diluted over the medium term to
about 45 per cent, as a result of decisions taken at the EGM.
Directors now have the power to issue shares up to the equivalent of 5 per
cent of the share capital. This will enable them to use paper as well as
cash to make acquisitions. The present board is anxious to take advantage of
sluggish markets in Europe to broaden its continental base.
The equity change comes against the background of a shift in emphasis at
Kalamazoo from printing systems to computer services. This has produced a
recovery in profits and encouraged the shares to rise this year from 26p to
a high of 116p, where they closed unchanged yesterday.
The EGM also agreed to a thrift plan allowing present and former employees
to save for the purchase of shares, with the company awarding one share for
every one bought. It approved share option schemes for senior managers.
Company directors have been negotiating for a dilution of the trust's equity
for at least three years, but latterly there has been some opposition.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca sees recovery in UK and US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcare markets in continental Europe remain depressed, while those in
the UK and US are gradually recovering, according to Zeneca, the
pharmaceuticals company, writes Daniel Green.
In its first quarterly trading statement since its demerger last summer from
ICI, it paints a broadly positive picture of its own trading in the second
half of 1993. All three of its businesses, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals
and seeds, and specialities, contributed to an improvement over the second
half of 1992.
Sales on the pharmaceuticals side improved, in spite of the continuing
decline of Tenormin, a heart treatment that was once easily the company's
best selling drug. Tenormin's US patents have run out and it is now subject
to competition from generic alternatives.
Pharmaceutical profits are expected to be slightly higher in the second
half. Agrochemicals and seeds continued to be depressed by the reform of the
European Union's agriculture policy, although there has been growth in
southern hemisphere markets.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Decision soon on Independent future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Newspaper Publishing, the publisher of the Independent and
Independent on Sunday, may be decided next week.
A board meeting scheduled for Thursday is becoming an effective deadline for
the submission of formal bids and offers.
There is a growing realisation that further delay could damage both the
credibility and future of the newspaper group which is believed to be
currently losing about Pounds 1.5m a year.
At the same time, considerable efforts are being made to calm staff fears
about the editorial implications of Mirror Group Newspapers taking a
substantial minority stake in the group.
The plan being negotiated by a consortium led by the paper's principal
founder, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, envisages MGN taking a 40 per cent stake.
The continental investors, El Pais and La Repubblica, would increase their
stake to 51 per cent with the founders holding the remaining block.
The deal would consolidate the position of Mr Whittam Smith who would remain
editor-in-chief. To remove fears of editorial interference it is believed
that MGN has agreed that it will not vote on either the removal or
appointment of editors.
The proposed board structure would also give MGN only two directors out of
seven. El Pais would have two directors as would La Repubblica. The final
directorship would go to a founder of the company, almost certainly Mr
Whittam Smith.
If a deal is finally agreed with MGN, a proposal will go forward to
Thursday's board meeting. Mr Ian Hay Davison, Newspaper Publishing chairman,
has made it clear he hopes to be able to put an alternative offer on the
table for the future funding of the paper.
Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group is expected to confirm a bid
for up to 29.9 per cent of the company.
The Irish group, which has only tiny newspaper interests in the UK, would
probably have less problem getting early agreement from the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission than MGN, which already owns three national newspapers in
the UK.
Mr Vincent Browne, editor and a minority shareholder of Dublin's Sunday
Tribune newspaper, in which Independent Newspapers has a 29.9 per cent
stake, has been ousted following a board meeting on Thursday, writes Tim
Coone.
No reason was given for his dismissal, which is bad publicity for Mr
O'Reilly, but the paper has been suffering from declining circulation and
mounting losses.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: World of Leather settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World of Leather, the USM-traded furniture retailer, has paid Pounds 150,000
in an out of court settlement with the distribution company which previously
handled the warehousing and distribution of its furni-ture.
The claim by the distributor was substantially higher than Pounds 150,000.
Each party will pay its own legal costs. World of Leather's costs are
expected to total Pounds 250,000, which will be accounted for as an
exceptional item in the full-year results.
World of Leather said that in the three weeks since December 26 its turnover
had increased by 20 per cent year-on-year.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Selective Assets beats benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Selective Assets Trust, managed by Ivory &amp; Sime to seek long-term capital
growth, lifted its net asset value per share by 31 per cent, from 155.95p to
203.76p, over the 1993 year.
The FT-SE-A All-Share Index, the trust's benchmark, improved 23.3 per cent
over the same period.
Mr Gordon Neilly, a director at I&amp;S, attributed the performance to the
trust's exposure to Asian and other emerging markets, and smaller
capitalisation growth stocks in North American and the UK.
Net revenue improved to Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 805,000), equivalent to
earnings of 3.72p (2.78p).
The single distribution for the year goes up from 1.2p to 1.45p.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: St Andrew Trust net assets rise 30%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong returns from UK smaller companies, coupled with good performances
from its continental European and Pacific Rim portfolios, helped St Andrew
Trust raise net asset value per share by 30 per cent in 1993.
The advance - from 249.5p to 324.8p - compared with an improvement of 23.3
per cent in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index.
The trust, 58 per cent-owned by the Ecclesiastical Insurance Office and
managed by Martin Currie, reported net revenue of Pounds 2.71m, up from
Pounds 2.58m, for earnings of 7.81p (7.42p) per share.
A recommended final dividend of 5.1p lifts the total to 7.8p (7.55p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shield Group, the estate agency, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 54,000 to Pounds 5,000 for the six months to September 30. Turnover
fell slightly, to Pounds 934,000 against Pounds 948,000.
Mr Norman Mazure, chairman, said the 'modest' profit was a reflection of the
cautious approach the directors had taken to the economic recovery. The
agency results had suffered, he said, because lending institutions had
disposed of a number of properties to BES funds.
Since the period end the group had diversified with the acquisition of Kamco
Computer Systems, a personal computers company.
There were losses per share of 3.2p (2.7p).

Malvern UK Index Trust, the UK's only investment trust with the objective of
tracking the performance of the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, raised net asset
value from 123.37p to 150.42p per share in 1993. This 21.9 per cent increase
 -excluding retained earnings - compared with a 23.3 per cent rise in the
Index over the same period.
Net revenue advanced from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 1.93m and earnings per
share grew from 3.77p to 3.99p. The recommended final dividend is 2.3p,
making a total of 4p (3.77p).
Taken together with the 27p rise in net asset value, total return to
shareholders over the year is 26 per cent, against the equivalent Index
return of 27.1 per cent.
As required by the trust's Articles of Association, shareholders are again
being asked to confirm that Malvern should continue for another year.
The trust is managed by Edinburgh Fund Manag-ers.

September 30.
Mr Michael Rusch, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said demand for

'We learned that the refrigeration industry operates very differently to our
main core business and that Acrokool's future would be much better served
with a more suitable partner.'
He added that talks were being held with a potential purchaser.
Turnover fell 16 per cent to Pounds 5.22m (Pounds 6.24m).
Earnings per share declined from 3.53p to 0.44p and the proposed final

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Park Food's seasonal loss rises - Sales of
hampers advance 16% over 'crucial' Christmas period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Park Food Group, which specialises in the sale of Christmas hampers,
yesterday announced an increase in losses for the six months to September
30, due to the seasonal nature of its business. However, it revealed
positive news on Christmas sales.
Pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.74m, compared with Pounds 3.22m, as a result of
higher expenditure on marketing in the run-up to Christmas.
Turnover advanced 26 per cent to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 9.1m). There were
stronger contributions from two peripheral businesses which produce airline
travel kits and cash vouchers for high street stores.
Mr Peter Johnson, chairman and a front-runner in the battle for Everton
football club, said that hamper sales, which account for 75 per cent of
group turnover, increased by 16 per cent over the crucial Christmas period.
The company claims a share of almost 40 per cent of the Pounds 300m UK
market for hampers.
Mr Johnson said firm orders were already up by 20 per cent so far this year.
'I am confident that profits for the full year will show a satisfactory
improvement.'
His optimism was demonstrated by a 25 per cent increase in the interim
dividend to 2.5p. Directors are also recommending a 2-for-1 scrip issue.
In the second half of the year, Park Food will gain a maiden contribution
from Handling Solutions, the promotions management company acquired in
mid-December for Pounds 9.3m.
Handling Solutions made a profit of Pounds 1.8m for the year to October
1993. With financing costs of 4 per cent for the Pounds 8.5m cash portion of
the acquisition, the company said it would produce a positive contribution
for the three months to March 1994.
The company, which is involved in promotional services, direct mail,
packaging and distribution, should also provide synergistic benefits.
Park Food has no gearing, and benefits from interest on substantial cash
balances from mail-order clients. At the interim stage net interest received
was Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 1.37m). Mr Johnson said he would not rule out
further acquisitions this year.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: The end is nigh for Bank of Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Edinburgh, a vehicle set up by three years ago to acquire small and
medium-sized building societies, is close to being wound up at a substantial
loss after its failure to take over any societies.
Bank of Edinburgh has been searching for new owners after its shareholders,
led by Scottish Amicable, asked to withdraw following the collapse of its
attempt to take over the Heart of England Building Society last March.
The Bank of England disclosed yesterday that the bank had given up its
banking licence. This was used to raise a small amount of deposits, and to
earn money by lending the bank's Pounds 5.9m capital and liabilities to
other banks.
Mr Russell Frith, finance director of the bank, said it had not yet decided
to close. 'We have decided that we must either find a new parent, or return
the money to the existing shareholders.'
In its last published accounts, for 1992, the bank had some Pounds 5.2m of
capital remaining from the Pounds 8m it drew from institutional investors.
The failure of the Heart of England bid led to a Pounds 1.58m write-down of
capital.
After repaying deposits to about 60 depositors, the bank is expected to be
able to repay only about half the capital it drew. Apart from Scottish
Amicable, other investors include life insurance companies and venture
capital groups.
The bank gained a licence when it took over the banking arm of Goode
Durrant, the financial services company, in 1992. Its original intention was
to acquire a number of societies and merge them into a single financial
services group.

<TEXT>
Brown &amp; Williamson, BAT Industries' US tobacco subsidiary, is to cut 700
jobs in a drive to maintain its competitive position in the US domestic
market.
The restructuring - a response to the cigarette price wars begun last year
by Philip Morris's decision to lower the price of Marlboro - will result in
a Pounds 45m charge against BAT's 1993 profits.
BAT said it expected to recoup the investment through increased
profitability over the next two years.
The reorganisation, which follows a review by McKinsey, the management
consultants, will streamline sales, marketing and administration. The sales
force will be reduced by 25 per cent and 20 per cent of the Louisville
headquarters staff will go.
B&amp;W expects the programme to be completed by the end of March.

FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Single premium side ahead at Allied Dunbar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Dunbar, one of the 10 largest UK life insurance companies, yesterday
announced its new business figures for 1993, showing steady growth in single
premium business.
The figures reflected the pattern elsewhere in the life industry, with
single premium business gaining, while annual premium business fell back, as
economic uncertainties such as fear of unemployment have made people more
reluctant to commit themselves to long-term policies.
Allied Dunbar's new single premiums rose sharply from Pounds 631m in 1992 to
Pounds 865m.
Within that total, however, there was a switch of business, as single
premium investments rose by 79 per cent to Pounds 548.6m (Pounds 307m), but
single premium pensions fell slightly from Pounds 323.5m to Pounds 315.8m.
New annual premiums also dropped slightly, from Pounds 162.1m to Pounds
158.5m.
New critical illness cover almost doubled, from Pounds 887m in 1992 to
Pounds 1.62bn. The company said the rise suggested a market trend towards
buying life and critical illness together, rather than buying just life
cover.
The company, which is a subsidiary of BAT Industries, attributed much of the
overall increase to its direct sales force, which numbers some 4,200 sales
agents.
National Mutual Life, a pensions specialist which markets entirely through
independent financial advisers, said yesterday that its new business had
risen to Pounds 236.1m, compared with Pounds 133.9m in 1992.
There was a particularly steep increase in its single premium new business
from Pounds 87.5m to Pounds 151.8m. Its regular premium new business also
rose, from Pounds 16m to Pounds 27.2m.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Epic tale with long shelf-life: The latest twist in the saga
of the British Library construction project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First it was the shelving, which scattered books and documents into open
space; then the wiring, which short circuited. Now it is the sprinklers,
which seem susceptible to rust. The construction of the new British Library,
one of the UK's biggest postwar building projects at an estimated cost of
Pounds 450m, seems to be becoming a metaphor for a nation in decline.
The saga of the library is a story of bureaucratic bumbling. The architect,
Colin St John (Sandy) Wilson, made his first tentative sketches for a
modernist Behemoth, softened by red brick, in 1962. The go-ahead for a
project, costed at Pounds 116m, came from Shirley (now Baroness) Williams in
1978. Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, influenced by the fact that her old
Oxford chemistry professor Fred Dainton was a leading advocate, finally gave
her approval 10 years later - although she caved in to Treasury pressure and
agreed a scheme which halved the size of the library, and added only 74
extra seats to make a total of 1,176.
As the projected costs have increased so have the delays, and now Dr Brian
Lang, chief executive of the library since 1991, is reluctant to commit
himself to a definite opening date. However, if the problems over the wiring
can be resolved, he is still hopeful of taking possession early next year
and welcoming the public in 1996.
Dr Lang is like a bridegroom waiting at the altar. His office is a prefab on
the St Pancras site and he is inextricably involved with the building, but
he accepts no responsibility for it. The Department of National Heritage
pays the bills - an estimated Pounds 52.5m in 1994-95 - and resolves
disputes among builders. Dr Lang's problems start if the British Library is
found wanting when its users move in.
Until the new setback over the sprinklers, which could take six months to
put right at an extra cost of Pounds 250,000, Dr Lang was feeling mildly
optimistic. Indeed there were plans to promote to the media a new,
on-target, building, and to take down the protective barrier on the Euston
Road, allowing the public to see the attractive Italian piazza which leads
to the library.
The confusion during the early stages of construction over the management of
the site had been much simplified when the formerly government-owned
Property Services Agency was privatised in 1992, and bought by construction
group Tarmac. The PSA had interfered constantly with its appointed site
manager, Laing, while only co-operating fitfully with the then Office of
Arts and Libraries, the ministry responsible for the scheme. In the same
year the OAL disappeared into the weightier Department of National Heritage.
A project director was appointed and Dr Lang says 'things are now much
better'.
At the same time the government seems to have decided that so much had been
invested in the library that it might as well finish it. The new minister at
the Heritage Department, Peter Brooke, was more of a books man than his
predecessor.
This has caused some anguish in the wider arts world which believes that the
funding of orchestras, theatres and dance groups has been sacrificed for the
mountain of bricks on the Euston Road. Mr Brooke found an extra Pounds 16.5m
from his department's budget for building costs in 1994-95, and the annual
grant-in-aid for day-to-day running of the British Library has risen from
Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 80.4m. But another of his responsibilities, the Arts
Council, paymaster to the performing arts, suffered its first ever cut in
funding, of Pounds 3.2m.
To justify the rise in the British Library grant, Dr Lang cites the
additional costs that are likely as it prepares to move out of its old home
in the British Museum, and 18 other buildings in London. He cannot yet
tackle the task of transporting 12m books into St Pancras. But he has pushed
through the completion of the British Library's northern base at Boston Spa,
near York, which will house 6m books; proceeded with automating the
cataloguing system; and is attempting to dispose of the surplus buildings in
London. At the St Pancras site, he contents himself with devising furniture
layouts.
Boston Spa enables Dr Lang to keep the Treasury sweet. By selling
information to business and academia, the library has increased its
revenues, and during 1992-93, in spite of the recession, receipts reached
Pounds 27m - up 3 per cent on the previous 12 months.
So while the short-term difficulties over sprinklers and wiring hark back to
the bad old days of the development, the political climate has improved
slightly in the library's favour. It has also been helped by the
transformation of the St Pancras area. When the site was selected it was a
wasteland. But the adjacent St Pancras Hotel, a Grade One listed Victorian
building, is being refurbished as offices and will act as a sympathetically
towered partner to the library.
Dr Lang is hoping that money from the planned UK national lottery will pay
for a visitor centre, a home for the National Sound Archive, and a bindery -
enabling the British Library to attract an estimated 1m visitors a year.
But the history of the library is a tale of hopes confounded. When it
eventually opens, the complaints may start as scholars, unhappy about being
decanted from Panizzi's beautifully domed room in the British Museum, fight
over the 150 terminals which will give access to behind-the-scenes staff who
will supply books and documents through a mechanical delivery system. More
obscure books will still be kept in Boston Spa, where the cost of storing a
book is 50p a year compared with Pounds 1.50p at St Pancras. But the
distance means at least a two-hour delivery time to London. The library will
remain a cultural football for decades to come.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Picking themselves up, dusting themselves off: Relief
co-ordination in LA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Arnold Newman considers himself fortunate. 'No tears have been shed in my
family,' he says. His hillside home in Sherman Oaks, a suburban community in
the San Fernando Valley, north of Los Angeles, is still standing. His wife
and eight-year-old daughter are alive.
Like tens of thousands of residents of Los Angeles, however, the Newmans'
lives were torn apart by this Monday's pre-dawn earthquake. On Thursday,
they joined about 500 others outside the Van Nuys Recreation Center to wait
for the opening of an emergency aid centre set up by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (Fema).
The Newmans need help. Their home is still standing, but the earthquake
damaged the roof, ripped plumbing from the walls and wrecked the interior.
Mr Newman's business - a pet store in a local shopping centre - was also
hit. 'We are being allowed in to feed and water the animals, but that is
all.' City officials have closed the shopping centre, pending an inspection
by engineers.
But Mr Newman's hopes are high: he believes he might qualify for a small
business low-interest loan. He is encouraged by reports that the Clinton
administration will 'cut through bureaucratic red tape' and start writing
cheques within the next seven to 10 days to people in need.
'I have to pay staff salaries, and for clean-up crews, and buy new stock. I
am out of business unless I can get help here. And perhaps they can help me
to make the house livable,' he adds. Since the earthquake, the Newmans have
been sleeping in their car.
Inside the makeshift emergency centre, one of 11 that has been opened in Los
Angeles, officials from a myriad of public agencies - federal, state,
county, city and local - are setting up tables and stacking application
forms. All the agencies should work together, President Bill Clinton urged
during his visit to Los Angeles this week.
James Lee Witt, head of Fema, which is spearheading the relief co-ordination
effort, is determined to avoid the confusion and delays for which the agency
has been widely criticised in the past. Months after the Loma Prieta
earthquake that hit the San Francisco area in 1989, victims were still
waiting for aid.
Already, he has announced plans to advance emergency funds to victims of
about Dollars 400m. Next week, he promises, the administration will seek
congressional approval for a 'supplementary appropriation' likely to be
billions of dollars. First, however, he must have 'a realistic assessment of
losses'.
Making that assessment is not easy. Insurance industry experts suggest that
total property losses may top Dollars 7bn. California Governor Pete Wilson
has suggested a 'ballpark' figure of Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn.
Mr Witt's priority is to provide emergency help for about 20,000 people
sleeping in city parks and cars. Working with the Red Cross, Fema is setting
up temporary shelters in schools, churches and any suitable building still
standing.
Water supply systems come next. Two large aqueducts that bring water into
the San Fernando Valley have ruptured. Mains have cracked and pipes are
broken in thousands of places. It may be weeks before full service is
restored and months before the water supply system is repaired.
'After we solve the distribution of water, housing is going to be the most
pressing human problem,' Mr Witt predicts. Thousands of Los Angeles
residents have found temporary accommodation in the homes of relatives and
friends, and so the full extent of the problem is unclear.
Schools, hospitals and other public buildings also need attention. About 100
schools are badly damaged; public libraries are teetering and government
offices wrecked. 'We have got to get the children back to school,' says
Senator Barbara Boxer, 'so that they can begin to see some normalcy in their
lives.' Three hospitals have shut.
Highways and bridges have collapsed. Already, work has begun on demolishing
sections of the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways. But it will take a
year to rebuild them, state officials say. Few believe such optimistic
projections: repairs to highways have yet to be completed four and a half
years after the Loma Prieta quake.
While the immediate needs are obvious, the long-term effects of the
earthquake on southern California's economy are more difficult to assess.
Already suffering from the cuts to its vital defence industry after the end
of the cold war, the 1992 riots and last summer's fires, Los Angeles has had
more than its share of recent misfortune.
Tourism, an Dollars 8.25bn industry in the Los Angeles area, is expected to
take the hardest hit as visitors go elsewhere. However, attractions such as
Disneyland and Universal Studios were back in operation 24 hours after the
earthquake and only 450 of the 91,000 hotel rooms in the region are
uninhabitable, say tourism officials.
Co-ordination among government agencies - whether it be advising would-be
visitors or handing out emergency aid - will be crucial in the months ahead.
So far, it is going well, officials say. 'I've never seen better
co-operation between different levels of government,' says Governor Wilson.
Yet Dick Andrews, director of the State Office of Emergency Services, says
there will be many difficulties. 'There are tangible actions that are taken
in the first hours and days after a disaster. People can see their
government in action. Then the problems become more intractable. There is a
tremendous opportunity for all of us to begin to find fault with the efforts
of others.'
Frustration and fear form a volatile mix. Many people leaving the emergency
centre in Van Nuys on Thursday are angry. 'All we got is an application form
and an appointment to come back next week. What good is that?' complains one
man. 'They just don't understand. How am I going to feed the baby?' cries a
young mother.
For Mr Newman, however, the visit is worthwhile. He will fill in the loan
application and hope for the best. In the meantime, talking about his
experiences seems to help. 'It took us almost 20 seconds to get out of the
bedroom. We were bouncing off the walls. We had broken toes and bloody feet
 -from the broken glass.'
In the early-morning light, he and his family became aware of the
devastation. The three-storey house on top of the hill had collapsed to one
storey. Their neighbours, miraculously, were unscathed.
Others were not so lucky. Two other homes had slipped down the hill. Firemen
were attempting to extricate a trapped woman. 'I asked if I could help and
they said fine, so long as I didn't let her know that her husband and child
were dead. We are so grateful to be alive,' says Mr Newman.

Sir, It is ironic that the NUT teaching union should accuse other unions of
'breaking the unity' over the teacher boycott ('Pressure on Patten eases as
two unions lift boycott', January 15). All the other five teacher unions
agree a famous victory has been secured for the teaching profession. Huge
changes have been secured to the national curriculum testing and assessment
system to slim down the workloads.
If any 'confusion' is created it will be in the minds of parents and the
public unable to comprehend why one union cannot acknowledge the enormous
progress that has been made and respond accordingly.
Recent history has some sad, if spectacular, examples of defeat being
snatched from the jaws of victory by unending industrial action in pursuit
of the total capitulation of the other side.

Sir, There is no doubt that the Elgin marbles 'housed in a museum (British)
which is universal in its scope. . .', 'constitute one of the greatest and
best-loved of its treasures' (Hawks &amp; Handsaws, January 15).
Personally, I am glad to admire them wherever they are. But I'm not quite
convinced about the method of payment the article proposes, 'if' the Greeks
were to buy them back. This is because, as it appears from your text, the
British do not seem to know if the Greek marbles were rescued by Lord Elgin
(according to the the British Museum's statement), or purchased, as Dr Susan
Walker, assistant keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British
Museum, is quoted as suggesting.
I therefore propose that we should let the price of the marbles be fixed
according to whether the marbles were rescued, purchased, or stolen by Lord
Elgin, as history admits.
Let's get real, this should be the only criterion for both parties involved
(olives, feta cheese and the three islands demanded in your article shall be
gratis to the British because, thank God, we have plenty of each).
I'm afraid this is how the 'market' works.

Sir, I hasten to respond to Ms Sylvia Webb's letter (January 17) about
Americanisms in books by British authors.
As the (British) author of a forthcoming book for a (British) professional
body, I was distressed to receive a catalog (sic) from my publishers,
describing the book I have allegedly 'authored'. When I took issue with this
usage, my complaint was dismissed on the grounds that the US is the largest
single market for English-language textbooks. (The fact that 'written' would
have been equally acceptable on both sides of the Atlantic was disregarded.)
Ironically, the textbook is on international marketing - a basic tenet of
which is respect for the language and culture of one's market.

Sir, You report ('Transport executives win aid for rail sell-off costs',

Can someone remind me why railway privatisation was thought to be such a
good idea? I can only remember two reasons: first, that it was impossible to
make any more public money available for railway subsidies; second, that
privatisation would reduce costs through efficiency gains. If neither
argument now applies, a great deal of public money is being spent on
reorganisation to no public benefit. William Wallace,

FT  22 JAN 94 / Back to basics, Tokyo-style: The defeat of reform proposals
may herald a return to traditional Japanese coalition politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's fiasco in the Japanese parliament marks a retreat from the
experiment that Japan embarked on last summer, when voters elected a
government dedicated to shaking up the political system.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the seven-party coalition which five months
ago ended 38 years of government by the Liberal Democratic party, was until
yesterday afternoon making decisive progress in his campaign to remove the
old, corrupt structures of Japanese politics.
The surprise defeat at the final parliamentary hurdle of his plans to
overhaul the political system, means the changes will be watered down and
the balance of power will shift away from the coalition and back towards the
LDP.
Mr Hosokawa's survival now depends on his ability to strike a deal with his
LDP enemies - who also happen to be former colleagues - on the plans to curb
political funding and scrap Japan's unique and scandal-prone system of
multi-seat constituencies.
His biggest coalition partner, the Social Democratic party, accidental
architect of yesterday's setback, can no longer be relied upon and is
unlikely to tolerate a deal with its arch-enemies in the LDP. The socialists
are, in any case, on the point of collapse after yesterday's humiliating
defection of 17 members, who crossed the floor to vote against the
government because they feared the proposed new electoral system would spell
the end of their party.
At the very least, the 17 defectors will be expelled from the party. On top
of this, the socialists' leader, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, hinted he may resign.
'The party's responsibility is grave,' he said, in what must seemed to many
like an ironic understatement.
Now that the socialists have proved a real liability, the parliamentary
majority of Mr Hosokawa's centre-right coalition is threatened and he needs
to find new allies. It is unclear what kind of grouping will succeed Mr
Hosokawa's alliance to face a general election likely in the next few
months. But political observers believe it will resemble the LDP - itself a
coalition of factions - if not be controlled by it. It is also likely to
include Mr Hosokawa. His straight-talking style and authoritative air as
scion of a famous Samurai family, has earned him a 60 per cent rating in
recent polls - a valuable electoral asset at a time when the image of his
profession is otherwise battered.
Mr Hosokawa is not the only one to have lost a big gamble. Yesterday was a
setback for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the 'shadow shogun' of the coalition, whose
departure from the LDP last summer helped precipitate its downfall. He has
been working ever since to destroy his old party as part of his strategy to
build a new power base.
Japan's political experiment has thus moved back more or less to where it
started, just at the moment when it was poised to achieve results. Japanese
television viewers could be forgiven for disbelieving their ears yesterday
evening when the NHK public network interrupted the final minutes of the new
year national sumo tournament to broadcast a press conference by a
stern-faced Mr Hosokawa.
Everyone knew the upper house vote would be close, but few had predicted
that Mr Hosokawa's plans would fare so badly, given that the lower house -
the more powerful of the two chambers - gave its blessing two months ago.
Even the LDP was surprised by the size of the margin - 130 votes against
118.
'This was completely unexpected. The coalition thought it could do
everything by sheer weight of numbers and by force. That is not the usual
procedure. That is why it had a revolt,' said Mr Kaoru Yosano, an LDP member
of parliament.
Mr Hosokawa has vowed to battle on, to try to negotiate some kind of reform
with the LDP in the few days left before the parliamentary session closes on
January 29. If he fails to pull off a deal by then, his government will
fall, along with its reform plans.
The LDP will drive a hard bargain. 'There is strong opposition in the party
to even discussing a compromise. We have been shamed publicly too many
times,' said Mr Yosano. At the same time, the LDP leadership does not want
to damage the party's already weak public popularity by killing reform
entirely. 'I strongly feel we must do something to regain people's trust,'
said Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president.
Mr Hosokawa said yesterday his next step would be to set up a joint panel of
the upper and lower houses, with 10 members from each chamber, to hammer out
a compromise. Under article 59 of the constitution, the panel needs a
two-thirds majority for an accord and then to pass the revised plans to both
chambers for approval by simple majority. Mr Hosokawa's chances of doing all
this by the end-of-the-month deadline are slim. If he fails, he would face
the choice of disbanding the cabinet, possibly with a view to re-forming it
with LDP help, or calling an election.
With Mr Hosokawa still keen to push ahead with reform, and neither side keen
on an election, the government is in no position to refuse the LDP's terms.
'The coalition is ready to accept all revisions of the package earlier
proposed by the LDP to prevent further confusion,' said Mr Yuichi Ichikawa,
a close ally of Mr Ozawa and secretary-general of the Clean Government
party, an influential group in the ruling coalition.
Negotiations will centre on the coalition's plan to reduce the size of the
lower house from the present 511 seats to 500, of which 274 would be elected
from single-seat districts and 226 by proportional representation.
The aim is to reduce the temptation for politicians to shower voters with
cash and favours - such as unnecessary motorways and bridges - to win votes,
and to increase the scope for competing on the quality of policy ideas.
Under the plan donations to individual politicians would be banned (although
donations to political parties would be permitted); the plan also proposes a
Y30.9bn a year public subsidy for parties.
Officially, the LDP leadership supports the general principle of scrapping
multi-seat constituencies, though some of its older members privately fear
that they will lose seats, some of which are dependent on generations of
careful local patronage.
The main changes sought by the LDP will be to increase the number of
single-seat constituencies, to divide the proposed single national
proportional representation district into several regional constituencies,
and to allow political donations to individual politicians. Crucially, these
changes would improve the LDP's chances of winning the next election,
because they suit a large party with efficient and rich local
organisa-tions.
Mr Hosokawa's future is uncertain and dependent on his success in the
frenetic bargaining in the weeks to come. However if, as seems likely, the
LDP manages to impose its will on the reform plans, Japan looks set to
revert to something like its traditional form of government - a broad
coalition of centre-right groups - but under a different political system.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Focus on student legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr N MCWHIRTER and Mr G RIDDICK MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Education bill stalled by angry Tory peers' (January 17),
overlooks the main deficiency of the government's proposed legislation on
student unions - that it concentrates more on the question of funding than
on the question of voluntary membership which lies at the heart of the
issue. Students are currently forced to belong to college unions which
engage in partisan and politically contentious activities.
Only a small proportion of political abuses by student unions involves
significant financial expenditure. For example, in the run-up to the 1992
general election, both the National Union of Students and individual student
unions carried out the 'Target 70 campaign' designed to help defeat
Conservative candidates in 70 marginal constituencies. As the then NUS
president, Stephen Twigg, stated: 'Let's work together, united on this
campaign. The government is our enemy.' (The London Student, February 27
1992).
In the recent past, more than 200 Conservative MPs and an overwhelming
majority of the public, as shown in opinion polls, have backed the
proposition that individual students should have the right to belong or not
to belong to a student union. It is this widespread opinion which initially
prompted reform - and which needs to be reflected in the bill. Only when
individual students have the right to 'vote with their feet' by walking away
from politically partisan college unions will most of the abuses be ended.
This need not mean that college authorities must take over the provision of
student facilities. The education bill would be improved if it provided for
the establishment of a facilities association which would offer only those
services which a college would supply if it were responsible for student
facilities. The bill should also provide for separate student unions, not in
receipt of public money and staffed by different personnel, and with
membership being voluntary.
It has wrongly been claimed by opponents of the bill that political abuse is
a thing of the past. Yet, in recent years, there has been a catalogue of
union discrimination against Conservative student associations in such
universities as Lancaster and Bradford.
The focus of the bill should be upon student democracy and the voluntary
principle, rather than funding.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Man in the News: Roll over, reformers - Viktor Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acclaimed victor of Russia's elections was the ultra-nationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky; the less obvious one was Mr Viktor Stepanovich
Chernomyrdin.
With the finesse of an astute politician, he had declared himself above
politics throughout much of the campaign - holidaying, then taking medical
treatment. The result, which gave no political force a dominant position in
parliament, was a perfect outcome for him. He continued to hold the prime
ministerial post because he stood not for any one of the many different
policies trumpeted by the various parties but for a little of each of them.
Unhappy and stumbling when first named prime minister in December 1992, and
saddled with radical economists whom he found at best uncongenial, he is now
his own man with his own cabinet. If he makes - or can claim  - a success
over the next year (which many think impossible), he will be in a position
to challenge for the presidency. He has shown not a scintilla of ambition
for the post: he is not the kind of politician who would.
Mr Chernomyrdin was one of the most successful Soviet enterprise managers,
rising to the top of the state gas monopoly in 1985, later revamped into a
state concern called Gasprom. He controlled what was, after oil, the
country's second-largest export earner, on whose gas flow large parts of
central and eastern Europe, especially Germany, depended. In May 1992, he
was appointed deputy prime minister responsible for energy, when President
Boris Yeltsin decided to dilute his radical cabinet with a few old-style
industrialists.
When, in December of that year, the pressure on the reformist Mr Yegor
Gaidar (then acting prime minister) to resign became irresistible, President
Yeltsin cast about for a successor. Mr Chernomyrdin emerged as a favourite,
leaping over more obvious candidates. His reputation for decisiveness, for
hard work and for belonging to no particular faction propelled him into a
seat for which, patently, he was unprepared.
His first appearance was shambolic. He called for a revival of heavy
industry and appeared to approve a decree re-imposing state controls on some
prices. He then renounced both. Then, a month after his appointment, he made
a speech at an international conference which was a model of reformist
rhetoric. The radicals, even shorn of Mr Gaidar (then presidential economic
adviser), still appeared to have their hands on the economic levers - the
more so since Mr Boris Fyodorov was brought back from the World Bank to be a
deputy premier in charge of finance.
Throughout 1993, when politics were dominated by the enervating battle
between parliament and president, Mr Chernomyrdin tacked cautiously. An
unguarded comment before the April referendum to measure support for the
president - to the effect that Mr Anatoly Chubais' privatisation campaign
was akin to Stalin's collectivisation of the peasants - was not repeated.
After Mr Yeltsin's victory in the referendum, he adopted the tactic of
conspicuous loyalty.
The suppression of parliament demonstrated how his power had increased. When
Mr Yeltsin announced that he was banning the assembly, it suddenly became a
matter of interest what his prime minister would say. His solid support,
coming after a not-too-indecent pause, was a reassurance. He had become an
independent player.
As the reformers sought to build on the president's success in banishing his
foes, Mr Chernomyrdin faded a little into the background. Yet he managed
still to protect Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, from
being fired, and always to keep a lifeline of credits to the industrial
enterprises.
While the election result traumatised the radicals, he, by contrast, calmly
began a round of talks with the leaders of all the parties represented in
the new parliament. He also gave an interview to Trud, the centrist daily,
promising an end to economic shock therapy, and began to bargain for a new
cabinet.
Mr Chernomyrdin must have been pleased at Mr Gaidar's surrender; Mr Fyodorov
was a tougher nut, refusing to leave. This week the latter sent a stinging
letter to Mr Yeltsin, saying the cabinet was sliding back towards communist
methods and demanding a commitment to reform, his way. Mr Chernomyrdin
ventured neither apology nor commitment, but did offer him a downgraded job
as finance minister. After a few days of stand-off, Mr Fyodorov resigned.
What Mr Chernomyrdin will do with his victory will decide the future of the
Russian economy. Few seriously accuse him of being a reactionary, but fewer
still would suggest he has metamorphosed into a radical. He gives no
indication of the extent to which he has imbibed the need to retain - or to
put in place - the totems of the radicals: in particular a tight credit
policy and rapid privatisation. The best bet is that he will continue to
regard inflation as the first enemy and will try to tame it. But he will be
a periodic victim to the demands of the industrial lobby and may be unable
to tread what Mr Alexander Shokhin, the new economy minister, called 'the
thin corridor between hyperinflation and industrial collapse'.
That corridor grows thinner by the day. The fall of the rouble, temporarily
stemmed by central bank intervention, showed a market fearful of the loss of
those who had striven to limit credit flows; a market with little faith in
either Mr Chernomyrdin or Mr Gerashchenko to continue the struggle.
Decisions such as that to merge the economic systems of Belarus and Russia
(in which Mr Chernomyrdin had a personal role), and to spend Dollars 500m on
a parliament building, are signs of a new confident carelessness with the
monetary system. It is not hard to construct a vision of a man pulled
further and further into stopgap, anti-inflationary measures - a man forced,
as he would see it, to reimpose the price, wage and planning controls to
which his instincts would probably guide him. There is a chance that Mr
Chernomyrdin will surprise us, but it is as narrow as the corridor down
which he must now walk.

FT  22 JAN 94 / A clear case of confusion: The UK economy is emitting
hard-to-decipher signals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past few days, the British economy has flaunted an increasingly
familiar mix of the good, the bad and the crazy.
Evidence of a strengthening recovery where price pressures are not an
immediate problem is impressive: unemployment dropping below 10 per cent in
December; a welcome quickening of manufacturing output growth in November;
headline inflation below 2 per cent last year; and yesterday's news that the
economy grew by a real, seasonally adjusted 2.5 per cent in the final
quarter of last year, compared with the same period of 1992.
On the other hand, a slight decline in retail sales between November and
December and a warning from the British Chambers of Commerce that growth
might be hitting a 'glass ceiling' prompted some to forecast an early
worsening of economic conditions.
Financial markets have this month reacted crazily in response to conflicting
signals. Ten days ago, news that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had
ruled out an early cut in bank base rates from 5.5 per cent triggered a
41.8-point drop in the FT-SE Index. On Wednesday, that decision apparently
forgotten, share prices soared as December's mildly disappointing retail
sales and a lower-than-expected jump in inflation last month revived hopes
of easier money.
Mr Clarke has done his best to calm the mood swings. The recovery, he has
said, is steady and strengthening. He has condemned as 'absolutely silly'
the hailing of good figures one day and bad the next. He has sought to
dampen interest rate speculation by stressing the need for a sustainable
recovery with growth that is 'really going to happen for some years ahead'.
But the chancellor is the man ultimately responsible for the radical changes
of mood. The tax increases announced in November's Budget, on top of those
still to take effect from his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget,
have made all conventional forecasts and projections subject to grave
uncertainty.
Nobody knows how the British public will react to April's cocktail of a 1
percentage point jump in employees' national insurance contributions,
reduced mortgage interest relief, the lower tax allowance for married
couples and the introduction of value-added tax on domestic fuel and power.
The tax increases planned for the financial year starting in April amount to
Pounds 8.4bn, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Add
those planned for 1996-97, and the cumulative effect will be 2.3 per cent of
GDP, according to this week's report on the Budget from the House of Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Committee.
Officials in both the Treasury and Bank of England agonised considerably
about the merits of a further interest rate cut before the chancellor met Mr
Eddie George, the Bank governor, for the first of their monthly discussions
of monetary conditions this year. But by the time the two met on January 12,
the reports of strong consumer demand over Christmas coupled with figures
pointing to accelerating monetary growth and falling dole queues had
persuaded both the Treasury and the Bank to put further monetary easing on
hold.
Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Today programme, Mr Clarke admitted on Thursday
that the increased taxation would 'check' the recovery. But he said the
upturn was strong enough 'to take it in its stride' and 'not to be stopped'.
He also said that more spending power would be going into the economy 'just
about now' as a result of mortgage interest rate cuts for the 8m borrowers
whose rates are changed annually.
The chancellor's claim was a reminder that the tax increases cannot be
viewed in isolation from the sharp fall in interest rates from 10 per cent
just before the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in
September 1992 to 5.5 per cent last November.
Much will depend upon how savers react to lower rates: and as the
accompanying article makes clear, they are a diverse group. The Treasury is
banking on a further decline in the savings ratio from 10.6 per cent in the
last year's third quarter, as low inflation, recovery in the housing market,
falling unemployment and a reduced burden of household debt strengthen
consumer confidence. The latest Gallup survey, published yesterday and
carried out between January 6 and 18, indicates a sharp increase in optimism
about the UK's economic outlook and less pessimism over household finances.
The volatile reactions of financial markets to the past month's economic
statistics show that Mr Clarke's goals remain imponderable. He is a
ubiquitous politician, but his explanations of policy can sound like saloon
bar verities, and it is clear that the markets do not yet know how to read
him.
Is he itching to cut interest rates as might befit a son of the industrial
Midlands? Or is he, like many others in the Tory party, so scarred by the
experience of the late 1980s, when rising inflation forced the government to
raise base rates to 15 per cent, that he will do his utmost to avoid putting
them up again?
Does his present reluctance to cut rates therefore reflect a fear of having
to raise them nearer to the general election that must be fought by the
spring of 1997? Or, with the government facing local government elections in
May and European elections in June, is Mr Clarke saving the next rate cut
for a month or two? He could then hope to hit two birds with one stone by
offsetting the contractionary effects of the tax increases, if these have
become apparent, while enhancing the feel-good factor among homeowners just
before the polls.
Another possibility is that the chancellor, like Mr George, with whom he has
established a good working relationship, is genuinely serious about the need
to get inflation in the UK firmly under control, and believes that there is
some way to go before this has been achieved.
There are plenty of signs that inflation in the UK is tamed rather than
defeated. The government's stated goal is to bring the underlying rate of
inflation, as measured by the retail prices index less mortgage interest
payments, into the lower part of the 1-4 per cent target range by the end of
this parliament. To achieve this, policy will have to keep bearing down on
inflation. Although this week's news on prices was better than expected,
underlying inflation has yet to fall below the 2.5 per cent mid-point of the
range.
In resisting pressure for rate cuts in recent days, Mr Clarke made clear he
is not a man to be blown off-course. The only problem is that it remains
unclear where that course is leading.

FT  22 JAN 94 / When savers don't prosper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone is talking about how wonderful it is that interest rates are coming
down. But what about people who took early retirement and invested their
lump sum in a building society?' Mr Peter Hutchings, 62, an ex-BTR
executive, speaks for many retired people. Over the past two years, he has
seen the gross return from his building society account fall from more than
11 to less than 5 per cent.
Government ministers say they receive more complaints when they cut interest
rates than when they increase them. It was partly to placate retired savers
that the government this week produced a Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond,
offering a fixed rate of 7 per cent paid monthly for five years.
Mr Hutchings is not impressed. Because he is less than 65 years old, he will
not be eligible to buy the bond. As he points out: 'A lot of people have
been retiring early over the last few years' and will not be able to
benefit.
Nevertheless, it is likely that the bond, which offers over 1 percentage
point more than similar building society products, will attract those who
like the security of a government-backed investment. Mr Herbert Maddocks,
77, a former chemical engineer from Chester whose income has fallen as a
result of lower rates, says he is impressed by the terms of the bond.
The elderly middle classes, a bedrock Conservative constituency, have not
all been hit. Most have corporate pensions, which have steadily increased
year by year, offsetting the effect of falling interest rates. Others have
diversified into bonds and equities, and have seen their capital rise
sharply in value as rates have declined.
However, caution has prevented some from reaping the full benefit. 'Our
investment income from the building society has dropped a hell of a lot over
the past few years,' says Mr David Burgoyne, 66, a retired civil servant
from Lincolnshire. He has mitigated this by moving some funds into equities,
but his wife, concerned about the safety of their capital, persuaded him to
limit his share purchases.
Falling interest rates are not the only problem for the retired. The tax
increases introduced in the two 1993 Budgets will start to affect their
incomes in April, particularly the imposition of VAT on fuel.
Mr Colin Firth, a retired accountant from Lancashire, has had second
thoughts about holidays after the effect on his income of interest rate
cuts. He calculates VAT on fuel will cost him a further Pounds 180 a year -
far more than the compensation package announced by chancellor Kenneth
Clarke in November. As a result, Mr Firth says he will have to cut back on
'luxuries' such as restaurant meals. Mr Burgoyne feels the same way: 'We may
have to cut back on luxuries such as package holidays and wine.'
The government will also be watching the reactions of a different set of
savers - those in work. As the tax increases kick in, it hopes consumers
will absorb the impact on their incomes by reducing their savings. There is
some sign of this already - the savings ratio fell from 11.7 per cent to
10.6 per cent between the second and third quarters of 1993 - but it has a
long way to go until it reaches the 5.4 per cent recorded in 1988.
Interest rates on many instant access accounts are now so low that many
consumers may decide it is no longer worth saving. But the effects are hard
to predict: some people may still be so concerned about the prospects of
unemployment that they continue to build up their nest egg.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Unpredictable ebbs and flows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US fund managers, when compared with their British counterparts, have tended
in the past to be thoroughly parochial. Not any more. Over the past 12
months, analysts have constantly detected American footprints behind
successive twists and turns in the global equity and bond markets. Yet there
is a paradox here, in that the US ran an estimated deficit on the current
account of its balance of payments last year of more than Dollars 100bn.
That implies that it had to import Dollars 100bn from abroad to finance the
deficit. How is it that a country importing capital on this scale could be
responsible for capital outflows that drove the rest of the world's markets
to record levels?
Part of the answer is that the global market in capital now operates on a
gigantic scale. Japan remains the biggest global saver, with a current
account surplus in 1993 that probably topped Dollars 140bn. But the smaller
European countries contribute significantly to the pot. Switzerland and
Benelux alone run current surpluses not far short of Dollars 30bn. And then
there are surpluses aplenty in the south-east Asian dragon economies, where
the Confucian virtue of thrift has a way of generating high capital exports.
If, as seems likely, the outflow of portfolio capital from the US last year
amounted to Dollars 130bn-Dollars 140bn, there will have been equal and
opposite flows in the form both of portfolio capital, direct inward
investment, short-term finance and so forth from the rest of the world.
Whereas in the 1980s much of the US deficit was bilaterally financed by
Japanese investors, the flows are now more diversified. Japanese capital
pours into Europe on a bigger scale; European capital goes to the US; and
since the global balance of payments has to balance, everything works out in
the end except in the official statistics, which fail to capture all the
movements. It follows from all this that predicting market trends on the
basis of balance of payments capital account movements is becoming
increasingly difficult.
Independent logic
The present pattern of international payments is likely to change
substantially over the rest of the decade as the US and most other large
industrialised countries reduce the structural element of their budget
deficits, which are a form of public sector dis-saving. The more normal
historical pattern, whereby rich countries export their savings to take
advantage of higher returns in the developing world, will reassert itself.
But whatever happens to the surpluses and deficits, the portfolio flow will
pursue an independent logic, because fund managers, especially in the US,
may continue to increase the overseas proportion of their funds.
It is precisely this structural change in the US investment portfolio that
has been moving the markets. The money that has poured out of the US banking
system and into bond and equity funds has spilled over into foreign markets.
More important, US life assurance companies and pension funds have been
persuaded of the virtues of diversification and are raising the foreign
content of their portfolios in order to reduce risk. SG Warburg Securities
estimates that if these institutions were to raise their target for foreign
assets to 10 per cent of the portfolio, it would generate another Dollars
300bn of net purchases of overseas assets, or Dollars 60bn a year over five
years. That would probably be more than enough to offset a sudden withdrawal
of mutual fund money in response to any increase in US short-term interest
rates.
Move markets
Japanese investors are the only other group with an ability to move markets
that bears comparison with the Americans. Here again, there has ceased to be
any obvious correlation in the 1990s between portfolio flows and the state
of the capital account. Despite a current account surplus that has gone from
Dollars 36bn in 1990 to more than Dollars 140bn in 1993, Japanese purchases
of foreign bonds and equities were negligible compared with the level of
outflow in 1989. But then in the last quarter of 1993 their foreign
purchases suddenly rose to more than Dollars 30bn, as they realised that
they were missing out on the rest of the world's boom when the domestic
market was sluggish.
If the Japanese economy starts to recover, the external account will shrink.
But Japanese portfolio movements will probably continue to obey a logic that
has recently been dictated more by perceptions about economies, currencies
and yield differentials than the balance of payments, or arm-twisting by
government bureaucrats. It would not be surprising if the outflow of
portfolio capital increases in the current year.
There is, of course, an alternative, contrarian, approach to cross-border
investment which argues that the foreign investor is usually the greater
fool to whom wiser domestic investors sell just before the peak of the
market. Certainly that could be argued of the Japanese, who sometimes appear
to compensate for their genius in manufacturing by creating bubbles in
finance. Maybe their sudden dash for foreign markets late last year should
be taken as a warning signal.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Labour attacks Major's 'corrupt' No 10 dinners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night accused Mr John Major of misusing Downing Street to raise
money for the Conservative party after the prime minister hosted the fourth
in a series of private dinners for leading businessmen.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, called the
dinners 'an old-fashioned, corrupt shake-down where desperate and tainted
politicians wine and dine businessmen and induce them to make large
contributions, often in secret.'
A senior government official said the prime minister had 'made very clear
that he does not use Number 10 for fundraising purposes'. But Conservative
Central Office confirmed that Thursday night's dinner was 'a private event'
paid for by the party.
Officials refused to release the guest list for the dinner, which is part of
a confidential series intended to help reduce the party's overdraft. It is
known that about 20 senior executives were invited from the banking,
manufacturing and service industries.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of the British Midland airline group, said the
prime minister gave a 'bravura performance' as he discussed the 'upbeat'
business outlook. Other guests included Lord Rothschild, chairman of St
James's Place Capital, the financial group; Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman
of Marks and Spencer; and Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of furniture retailer MFI.
Guests contacted by the FT said there was no discussion of fundraising
during the evening. 'It was a private meeting. No one mentioned money,' said
Mr David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers, the investment bank.
Senior officials have confirmed that there is never any direct discussion of
contributions. The dinners are billed as an opportunity for guests to put
their views directly to the prime minister. Guests would be contacted later
by party treasurers.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Ministers quail as Tory lords 'do their duty': Four of the
government's bills are facing serious trouble in the upper house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past, wrote LP Hartley, is another place; they do things differently
there. Indeed they do, as ministers are finding to their cost in the House
of Lords.
Like Baroness Thatcher before him, Mr John Major is discovering that the
permanent Conservative majority in the Lords does not guarantee support for
Conservative legislation.
The government is facing serious trouble on four bills in the upper house -
an almost unprecedented scale of opposition in a chamber dominated by
Conservative hereditary peers.
The latest outbreak came on Tuesday, when the police and magistrates' courts
bill, which implements reforms announced at October's Conservative party
conference, was savaged during its second reading debate.
A week earlier, the education bill, which reforms teacher training and
reduces the independence of student unions, was given an almost equally
rough reception.
There is also unrest - stoked on Wednesday by Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the
Lord Chief Justice - about some aspects of the criminal justice bill, which
amends the so-called right to silence for defendants in criminal trials.
And sceptical whispers are circulating on the Lords' red leather benches
about sweeping new ministerial powers contained in the de-regulation bill,
published on Wednesday.
Modern governments are not made and broken in the Lords. But ministers are
nervously aware that trouble in the upper house can spread rapidly to the
Commons if not smartly checked.
For the moment, Downing Street is trying hard to appear unruffled. But
concern is growing, as Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, told the cabinet
on Thursday.
The government is most concerned about the quality of the emerging
opposition, which ranges from prominent Conservative academics such as Lords
Beloff and Skidelsky on the education bill to the independent Lord Knights,
a former chief constable, and Lord Carr, a former Conservative home
secretary, on the police bill.
The most damaging criticism has come from Lord Whitelaw, Lady Thatcher's
deputy prime minister, widely regarded as the former prime minister's most
influential adviser until his retirement in 1988.
Lord Whitelaw did not mince his words. He told the Lords: 'When I find I am
anxious and concerned, surely it must be my duty to speak out firmly, and
that is what I am doing.'
As one senior minister put it, when a Conservative government finds that men
such as Lord Whitelaw think it their duty to speak out, something is going
very wrong.
Lord Richard, Labour's leader in the Lords, puts the government's problems
down to a mixture of arrogance and bad management. The Conservative
rebellion, he says, requires little assistance from Labour.
Others see the eruption of unrest as a response to the government's waning
authority. 'This is a classic sign of a weak government,' says a pessimistic
minister.
Peers are well aware of the rumbling divisions among Conservative MPs, which
have left some maverick backbenchers willing to oppose the government on
almost any issue.
With Mr Major's narrow Commons majority of 17, it is hard to threaten to
reverse Lords defeats in the Commons when just nine rebel Conservative MPs
can hold the government to ransom.
However, the Lords is hamstrung by the Salisbury rules, named after the
Victorian Conservative prime minister, under which peers do not oppose the
principle of legislation for which the government has a manifesto mandate.
But feelings are running high, as Lord Whitelaw's intervention showed. For
the moment, the cabinet has decided to wait and see what happens. But peers
say it is likely to take more than a few minor concessions to get the
government off the hook on which it has impaled itself.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Swiss bank sacks two London staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two London staff of UBS, the Swiss bank, have been dismissed and two others
have resigned following breaches of internal procedure, the bank said
yesterday.
Market sources said they believed the resignations and dismissals related to
an overstatement of profits on one of the bank's proprietary trading
positions. There is not believed to have been any collusion between the
individuals.
The bank said no losses were incurred by it or clients and the rule breaches
were not a criminal matter.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Sharp increase in written-off tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in business insolvencies between 1989 and 1992 led to a sharp
increase in the amount of tax that was written off by the Inland Revenue.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, said Pounds 1.69bn in tax was written off in 1992 - nearly three
times the amount written off in 1990.
The Inland Revenue attributed the increase to bankruptcies and to changes in
the way that insolvency was administered in those years.

Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, has received its second writ in connection
with assets contested by pension schemes formerly controlled by Robert
Maxwell.
Robson Rhodes, joint liquidators to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the
Maxwell-owned fund management company which handled most of the pensioners'
assets, is seeking more than Pounds 15m worth of shares from Credit Suisse.
The writ alleges that the shares were deposited during 1990 and 1991 as
security for a Pounds 50m facility provided to Robert Maxwell Group.
In 1992, the Mirror Group Pension Scheme filed a separate writ against
Credit Suiss for assets provided to Credit Suisse as security for the same
Pounds 50m loan. The civil trial for that case is set to begin next week.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Financial advisers warn over PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers yesterday warned
that it might support calls for statutory regulation of financial services,
Alison Smith writes.
Mr Bill Raynes, chairman, said the federation did not want statutory
regulation but was not prepared to accept the version of self-regulation
proposed for the personal investment authority (PIA).
The latest controversy was sparked by the PIA's decision that only nine of
its 19-strong board should be working in the industry. This prompted the
resignation from the board of Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of
Standard Life, who argued that this could not amount to self-regulation.
Mr Garry Heath, federation chief executive, said: 'Too many product
providers have locked the door of their closet and despite Jim Stretton's
principled stand have not come out and been counted.'
He added, however, that the federation had dropped plans to apply for
judicial review into the PIA board structure.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein delivers stinging blow to hopes for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an early end to the IRA's 25-year campaign of violence in Ulster
suffered a fresh blow last night as Sinn Fein responded scathingly to new
efforts by London and Dublin to breathe life into their peace initiative.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the only positive aspect about
an attempt by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to reassure
nationalists about last month's Downing Street declaration was the
recognition that clarification could be appropriate in future.
Mr Adams described the declaration as 'a masterpiece of ambiguity'. He said
it was absurd that the UK government would not 'supply the request for
clarification that has been put to them in quite reasonable terms by me'.
His remarks reawakened fears that a prolonged stand-off between the two
camps was in prospect. Mr Adams insisted, however, that the political wing
of the IRA was not 'searching for a 'no''. Sinn Fein was 'not going to allow
the British government to squander this opportunity for peace'.
He told Channel 4 News: 'It's not exactly the best government the British
people have had to rule them. It's a very dismal government on many domestic
counts and no different in terms of its dealing with the question of
Ireland.'
His remarks followed the delivery of a firm rebuff from Downing Street to
Sinn Fein's demand for direct dialogue on the declaration. Downing Street
accused Mr Adams of seeking to 'reopen issues for renegotiation' in a letter
sent to the prime minister earlier this month.
Publishing both this original letter and a terse response signed by a senior
government official, Downing Street told Mr Adams that there was 'no
question' of the joint declaration being renegotiated. 'That text, and only
that text, is what is at issue,' it said.
Mr Adams reacted angrily, accusing Mr John Major of 'a patently obvious
attempt to frustrate a genuine effort to end the stand-off'.
The release of the letters coincided with a Commons debate in which Sir
Patrick said Sinn Fein had given no 'particulars' of what it wanted
clarified. Talk of clarification was 'but a smokescreen to distract
attention' from whether 'all those now engaged in violence' would renounce
it.
Drawing on an earlier speech seeking to reassure nationalists and unionists,
Sir Patrick said the aspiration of a united Ireland by peaceful means was
'fully legitimate'. He hinted that Britain's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein
would be lifted only if republican leaders renounced terrorism.
Sinn Fein has said it will make no formal response to the Downing Street
declaration until at least the end of next month.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Lending boosts money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A post-Budget pick-up in private-sector lending boosted the broad measure of
the money supply last month and confirmed that the trend in borrowing is
firmly upwards.
Bank of England figures showed that sterling lending by banks and building
societies to the private sector - M4 lending - was a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 4.1bn last month compared with Pounds 0.55bn in Nov-ember. This took
the year-on-year growth rate of M4 lending - a good indicator of consumer
and company confidence - to 3.6 per cent from 3 per cent in the year to
November.
The broad money supply measure, M4, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent
last month compared with the previous month, a much stronger rise than
expected. It was up 5.5 per cent in the year to last month, the highest
growth rate since August 1992. It compared with 4.9 per cent in November.
Analysts said the acceleration in the M4 growth rate almost certainly
represented a bounce back from the very depressed November lending figure,
but nonetheless reflected a gradual upwards trend. Most of the growth was
concentrated in the company sector with personal-sector borrowing still
relatively depressed.
Figures yesterday from the British Bankers' Association showed that lending
by the UK's main banking groups last month was lower than in November, but
above the average of the previous six months.
Lending by the nine banking groups - which covers only a proportion of the
overall M4 bank and building society sector - rose a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 1.42bn in December compared with November's rise of Pounds 2.13bn.
Lord Inchyra, BBA director-general, said that in spite of the slowdown last
month, the longer-term trend in lending showed a definite advance from its
low point a year ago.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Labour claims some Tory MPs will refuse to support domestic
fuel VAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour claimed yesterday that 12 Conservative MPs will refuse to support the
government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel in a vote on
the finance bill next week.
Such a rebellion would be enough to ensure victory for a Labour amendment
reversing the phased imposition of VAT announced by Mr Norman Lamont, then
chancellor, in last year's March Budget. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor,
said the list was compiled from Conservatives who opposed the measure during
the passage of the 1993 finance bill or before the November Budget of Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
However, the list takes no account of the compensation package included in
Mr Clarke's Budget, which is believed to have satisfied many potential
rebels. The list was ridiculed by senior Conservatives. Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Brown had 'nothing better
to do all day than think up headlines'. Mr Brown said pressure on Tories
would be increased by revised Inland Revenue tax codings being despatched
this week.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Building societies face cash pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fierce competition for personal customers' savings contributed to a net
outflow of Pounds 121m of building society funds last month.
Figures released yesterday by the Building Societies Association also
highlighted the pressure that societies are under in the mortgage market.
Net advances last year totalled Pounds 9.4bn, compared with Pounds 13.5bn in
1992 - indicating a loss of market share to the banks, whose fixed-rate
mortgages have proved popular.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, said that with
interest rates expected to remain at or below their present levels in the
coming year, the intense competition for savings looked set to continue.
The figures showed an outflow for the second month running, following the
Pounds 400m net outflow in November. It is only the second recorded outflow
in December.
Last year societies recorded a net inflow of Pounds 2.2bn - a significant
advance on the 1992 figure of Pounds 295m but well below the levels of
recent years.
Societies are expected to step up their efforts to keep customers' savings
through products such as unit trusts over the coming months, even where this
could mean a shift from their own deposit accounts.
During the year there was an increase in retail funds of Pounds 10.7bn
because of interest credited to savers which was left in their accounts.
Mr Coles emphasised that societies would warmly welcome the government's
decision to review the 40 per cent limit on the proportion of funds which
societies can raise from the wholesale markets.
The announcement of a review of societies legislation, which will include an
examination of the wholesale funding limit, came on Thursday  - as the
government gave details of its guaranteed income bond for pensioners.
Societies expect some outflow of funds from savers eligible for the new
product.
Net advances last month were Pounds 624m compared with Pounds 880m in
November, while net new commitments fell to Pounds 2.1bn last month from
Pounds 2.8bn the previous month. Mr Coles said that the downturn last month
reflected a 'normal seasonal dip in activity around the turn of the year'.
In 1992, however, there was much less difference between the November and
December figures.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Consumers more optimistic in poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British consumers are more optimistic about the economic outlook although on
balance they still expect unemployment to rise this year, Gallup, the market
research group, says.
In its monthly survey for the European Commission, Gallup found that
consumers were less worried about their own financial position in spite of
the tax increases announced in the November Budget.
Although a majority still expect their own financial situation to
deteriorate over, the answers on household finance were the most positive
for four months. The number of pessimists outweighed optimists by 12
percentage points compared with 18 points in December. Gallup polled 2,035
adults between January 6 and 18.
As is often the case in January, when the sales are in full swing, there was
a sharp increase to 44 per cent in the number of consumers declaring that
the present was a good time to make a large purchase.
On balance, the number of people favouring a large purchase exceeded those
saying that it was the wrong time to buy by 19 percentage points - 15 points
higher than in December.
The survey found people equally divided over whether the economy would
strengthen this year. The resulting zero balance was 9 points up on that of
December and the most positive since September last year.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Whitehall 'protected ministers on Iraq'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asked civil servants
to draft parliamentary replies over the arms-for-Iraq affair with the aim of
protecting the government from further embarrassment on the issue, the Scott
inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Nicolas Bevan, a former Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office official,
said Mr Heseltine had suggested to Whitehall officials and fellow ministers
in November 1992 that there should be only a simplified statement on the
government's involvement.
The minister's intervention was to ensure the government would be seen to be
consistent in fielding questions about its guidelines on arms sales. 'Mr
Heseltine felt that the ground beneath his feet was shifting and he wasn't
sure it could be solidified,' Mr Bevan said.
In November 1992 cabinet officials, including Mr Bevan, advised the prime
minister that ministers had considered a change in guidelines restricting
arms sales to Iraq, but had decided against it. Ministers told officials to
interpret the guidelines more flexibly, but there was, Mr Bevan advised, no
change in substance.
Mr Bevan's advice was challenged by Mr Michael Coolican, a senior DTI
official. His view was that it was 'quite clear' that the way the guidelines
had been operated was different to information previously given to
parliament.
According to an internal DTI memorandum made available to the Scott inquiry,
Mr Heseltine believed that civil servants' drafts of parliamentary answers
concerning the guidelines 'run the risk of storing up trouble for ministers
when Lord Justice Scott delivers his report'.
The inquiry was adjourned until Tuesday when evidence will be given by Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.

FT  22 JAN 94 / GP drugs budgets to rise by 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has increased its allocations for general practitioner
prescribing by 12.3 per cent for 1994-95, compared with the current year, in
spite of ministerial claims last year that the National Health Service drugs
bill was already too high.
The health department said the rise meant it expected GPs in England to
spend Pounds 3.2bn on drugs. GPs prescribe about 80 per cent of drugs by
value, with the rest from hospitals.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said the increase was partly the result
of 'the continuing rise in the number of elderly patients and medical and
pharmaceutical advances'.
New drugs such as Glaxo's Imigran, the first mass-market migraine treatment,
launched last year, may have played a role in the higher bill.
But the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries responded to the
DoH statement by arguing that prices of drugs had actually fallen in real
terms. It said: 'Drug prices were subject to a 2.5 per cent decrease in 1993
and have been effectively frozen for the next three years.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Leak reveals government fears on traffic pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fumes and noise from the ever-increasing volume of traffic on British roads
pose one of the biggest threats to the environment, according to a leaked
section of a government strategy document due to be published next week.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, yesterday released
the excerpt from UK Strategy for Sustainable Development which Mr John
Gummer, environment secretary, is due to issue on Tuesday.
The document - part of Britain's commitments to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro - will set out government plans to put the UK on to a more
environmental footing in the long term. It aims to curb pollution and waste,
and to enable the UK to meet its international treaty obligations to clean
up the atmosphere. There will also be plans to preserve animal and plant
life and forests.
The leak, which contains some proposed final amendments, shows that while
the government is worried by the growth of traffic, it also wants to avoid
painting the threat in too controversial terms.
In an accompanying letter, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, asks Mr
Gummer to delete a comment that 'some road construction proposals threaten
protected nature sites and other sensitive areas'. He is also unhappy with
the statement that traffic growth in some parts of the country 'would
produce unacceptable economic and environmental consequences'.
The draft says the government will have to produce measures to influence
traffic growth.
Friends of the Earth said the document showed the government was far from
agreed on a sustainable transport policy.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Sky's the limit for soaraway Kelvin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Exclusive: the Queen Mother's killer corgi Ranger has savaged Fergie's
dog,' says the main article on the front page of this morning's Sun.
Students of tabloid journalism will instantly recognise the style of Mr
Kelvin Mackenzie, editor for 13 years.
But they will have to turn to the bottom of Page 2 to learn that it is one
of the last issues to be edited by him.
The archetypal tabloid editor, who rarely appears on television, is leaving
what used to be called Fleet Street to be managing director of British Sky
Broadcasting.
Mr Gus Fischer, chief executive of the paper's parent company News
International, said Mr MacKenzie deserved such a career move. 'He is very
smart,' Mr Fischer added. 'He can also be serious, very serious.' At BSkyB -
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a stake - he will join Mr
Sam Chisholm, chief executive, one of the few people in the UK media who is
every bit as direct in his language as Mr MacKenzie.
Mr Chisholm, who will be showing 47-year old Mr MacKenzie the ropes from
next Monday, said last night: 'The great thing about Kelvin is he is a
highly creative, very energetic man with a great deal of flair and
imagination.'
Mr Stuart Higgins, aged 37, the deputy editor of The Sun and acting editor
of the News of the World, will become only the third editor of the paper
since its relaunch by Mr Rupert Murdoch in 1969.
Mr MacKenzie was saying little last night about his new job. He did issue an
uncharacteristically bland quote about having had the best job in British
journalism for the past 13 years and was now on his way to one of the most
exciting challenges in television. Other than that he could not be
distracted from editing this morning's paper.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Council raids builders' offices in fraud probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour-controlled London Borough of Lambeth has taken the unprecedented
legal step of raiding the offices of one of its own sub-contractors,
confiscating documents and freezing funds as part of an attempted crackdown
on alleged fraud.
Mr Paul Claydon, the district auditor who last year attacked the south
London borough in a report, claiming that Pounds 20.2m had been spent
unlawfully, has backed Lambeth's 'unique' action, signalling that local
authorities will be encouraged to take a tougher stance on fraud.
In a management letter to council members, he says: 'I regard the council's
success in obtaining High Court orders as a sound, appropriate and
imaginative approach to the recovery of large sums which may have been
overpaid.'
Last October council officials obtained injunctions from the High Court
against Botes Building, a London-based maintenance company which carried out
work on council houses in six of Lambeth's 20 administrative areas.
Solicitors for the council, accompanied by independent solicitors, raided
Botes's offices and removed and copied thousands of documents.
Lambeth claims that it was overcharged a total of Pounds 4m by Botes
Building, and its managing director, Mr Ian Botes. There are three other
defendants: a former Lambeth employee; a consultant surveyor previously
retained by Lambeth; and a former director of Botes who left the company
last year.
Mr Botes and the company were ordered by the High Court to pay Pounds
100,000 into an account. This was raised to Pounds 250,000 by the Appeal
Court after an appeal by Lambeth.
Lambeth's claim concerns four contracts, three on individual properties,
including a building in Guildford Road, Stockwell, and one claim of Pounds
3.5m covering the council's maintenance contract, which includes thousands
of individual transactions.
Mr Justice Judge said there was 'powerful evidence to support the allegation
that the Guildford Road contract was marked by dishonesty and fraud on
Lambeth which involved employees of both Lambeth and Botes'. He said that
'by not earlier than early 1993 Mr Botes personally was aware of very
serious anxieties to which this contract was giving rise'. He added: 'In
spite of that knowledge he neither acted personally to ensure that the issue
was ventilated with Lambeth, nor did he instruct his staff to do so.'
However, Lord Justice Evans, speaking in the Appeal Court, said Lambeth's
claim for a Pounds 4m limit was 'clearly excessive on the material now
before us', and added that Lambeth's records were not yet up to date.
The court was told that Mr Botes had done a 'quick check' in October and had
arrived at an overvaluation figure - the difference between the value of
work Botes did and the amount Lambeth paid them - of Pounds 1m for the
maintenance contract. Lord Justice Evans said Lambeth 'should be free to
renew their application when clear evidence, simply stated, becomes
available to them to justify a certain or approximate sum as the value of
their claim in respect of the maintenance contract'.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Code of bank practice to change after complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The governing principles of the code of banking practice are likely to be
spelt out in a new section of the code when the second edition is published
shortly.
The expected revision would move the clauses setting out broad commitments
about how banks should behave from the introduction to the main body of the
code.
One of the arguments put forward by organisations such as the National
Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux for a statutory code of banking
practice has been that banks have been ignoring the spirit of the voluntary
code, and the change appears to be intended to meet that point.
At present, the principles say that banks should act fairly and reasonably
towards their customers, should try to give customers a good understanding
of how their accounts operate and how the banking system works, and should
maintain confidence in the security and integrity of banking and card
payment systems.
The new version is also expected to reflect concerns expressed by the
Consumers' Association and others that bank staff serving customers did not
know enough about the code, and that bank branches did not carry enough
information about it.
Changes to the code have been drafted by a joint working party of three
trade associations representing banks and building societies - the British
Bankers Association, the Association of Payment Clearing Services and the
Building Societies Association.
The working party received recommendations from an independent review
committee headed by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank
of England. The new edition is expected to be published by the associations
next month.
Other revisions are expected to require banks to introduce pre-notification
of charges on personal customers' accounts; and to tighten the wording that
requires banks to obtain the consent of customers before giving their

FT  22 JAN 94 / Caterpillar wins derecognition vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
White-collar staff at Caterpillar (UK) have agreed by a large majority to
end collective bargaining and accept the derecognition of their unions in
return for a package of inducements including lump sum payments of Pounds
500.
The vote was 103 in support of the offer with 45 against. Last week
supervisors and senior technicians at the company's digging-machinery plant
outside Leicester voted for union derecognition.
The company - the world's biggest manufacturer of construction equipment -
said staff had 'expressed their preference for working directly with the
management'. The unions involved were the MSF technical union and the Apex
white-collar section of the GMB general union.
The company added that this was 'part of an on-going strategy to expand
employee involvement'. It refused to say whether it would extend its offer
to manual workers.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Cash-with-order adverts reprieved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European Union plan that would have prevented advertisers from demanding
cash with customers' orders has been scrapped.
The EU's draft 'distance selling' directive has been amended, after strong
lobbying by UK advertising groups, and now omits all reference to the
proposed cash-with-order ban. Under the previous draft, consumers ordering
goods by post would have been entitled to wait for the goods to arrive
before forwarding their cash.
The Direct Marketing Association said it was 'surprised and pleased' that
the Greek presidency of the EU had decided to amend the draft. The
association said the cash ban would have been a 'fraudsters' charter' and
some advertisers' existence would have been threatened by the increased
burden of bad debt.
The redrafted directive cuts out other controversial proposals, including
restrictions on the way travel agents collect payment, and a clause which
would have outlawed unsolicited selling by telephone.
The selling of financial products is also now excluded from the draft
directive as it is covered by other legislation.
The remaining provisions of the draft directive are broadly in line with
current industry agreements and legal restrictions on direct marketing in
the UK, said the DMA. However, there were still a few clauses relating to
credit card payments, books and magazines which were unacceptable, said Mr
Colin Fricker, DMA legal director.
The European parliament is due to consider the draft directive later this
year. Concerns remain that the parliament could reverse the latest
amendments. Mr Fricker said 'vigilance and pressure' must be sustained to
prevent reversion to the earlier wording.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Virani 'a victim of fraud at BCCI'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former property entrepreneur, was a victim of, not a
participant in, the fraud perpetrated by the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, his barrister, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, told the Old Bailey
yesterday, John Mason writes.
In an opening statement to the jury, Mr Scrivener said there was no dispute
that BCCI had been run by a 'gang of crooks'. However, Mr Virani had been
'duped' by a senior BCCI figure into signing documents which the prosecution
claims show he was part of a conspiracy to inflate the bank's profits by
Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m).
Mr Virani denies one charge of conspiring to defraud BCCI investors, one of
theft, one of false accounting and 11 of furnishing false information to
Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors.
Mr Scrivener said that when BCCI got into its deep financial difficulties,
Mr Mohammed Haque, the head of BCCI's London property division, was told to
create fictitious accounts intended to fool the auditors.
These included letters which falsely confirmed that the Virani group of
property companies had loans from BCCI totalling Dollars 30m. Mr Virani had
trusted Mr Haque and had not studied these letters closely, before signing
them, Mr Scrivener said.
Although Mr Virani had been fooled by BCCI, he was in good company, Mr
Scrivener went on. The Bank of England, accountancy firm Price Waterhouse,
the ruler of Abu Dhabi and other wealthy Middle Eastern figures had also
been duped, he said. The trial continues on Wednesday.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Concrete producers again accused of contempt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contempt of court proceedings have been issued against some of Britain's
biggest producers of ready-mixed concrete and against eight company
directors alleged to have operated price-fixing and market-sharing
agreements.
It is the second time in three years that some producers have faced contempt
proceedings involving subsidiaries.
If found guilty again, the companies could face unlimited fines and
directors could be fined or imprisoned for up to two years, according to the
Office of Fair Trading, which brought the charges.
In the latest action, nine companies are alleged to have broken court orders
and undertakings not to operate price-fixing and market-sharing agreements
in north-west England, East Anglia, the east Midlands, London and the home
counties.
They are: Hartigan Readymix of Newport Pagnell; Mixconcrete, London; Pioneer
Concrete (UK), London; Tarmac Roadstone Holdings, Wolverhampton; Willment
Ready Mix Concrete, London; and four subsidiaries of RMC, the world's
biggest concrete company - Ready Mixed Concrete (Eastern Counties), Ready
Mixed Concrete (London), Ready Mixed Concrete (North West), Ready Mixed
Concrete (Transite) of St Albans.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, alleges that the
companies had breached court orders and undertakings given to the
Restrictive Practices Court in the 1970s.
Sir Bryan said: 'We have now amassed a substantial amount of evidence to
suggest flagrant and widespread breaches of competition law. The evidence
also suggests that previous court orders banning collusion have been
ignored: the participants must now answer to the court.'
RMC said yesterday that since 1978 it had issued express instructions to
staff not to participate in any market arrangement. It said it would defend
the legal proceedings brought against its four staff.
Three years ago Ready Mixed Concrete (Thames Valley), Hartigan Ready Mixed,
50 per cent owned by building materials group Redland, and Pioneer, a
subsidiary of the Australian materials group, were fined a total of Pounds
56,000 for disobeying court orders prohibiting them from entering
market-sharing agreements in Oxfordshire. Mr Anthony Hullett, a manager at
RMC, was fined Pounds 1,200.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Gas shake-up rules will be draconian, says watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, said yesterday that 'draconian'
mechanisms will be put in place to ensure the complete separation of British
Gas's transportation and storage unit from its trading arm.
In her first major speech since the government last month rejected a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendation that British Gas be broken
up, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, told a conference that
she intended to 'police the separation very stringently'.
People in the independent gas market needed to have complete confidence that
'commercially sensitive information given to (British Gas's) transportation
and storage division is safe', she said. Severe penalties would be imposed
on British Gas if any breaches of the 'Chinese walls' occured.
Ms Spottiswoode said the previously strained relationship between Ofgas and
British Gas had improved markedly in recent months.
At the conference Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, assured
sceptical independent gas marketers that British Gas's trading arm would
'pay on the same basis as any other pipeline customer'.
But Mr Kris Maroe, chief executive of Alliance Gas, a joint venture between
British Petroleum and the Norwegian companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro,
called for 'concrete' rather than Chinese walls.
Ms Spottiswoode unveiled an ambitious timetable to meet the government's
target for the partial lifting of British Gas's monopoly over the mainly
residential sector of 18m consumers in 1996. Full abolition will coincide
with the opening of the domestic electricity market in 1998.
She confirmed that worries about the ability of British Gas's information
technology and residential metering system to cope with a sudden shift of
consumers to independent suppliers was the reason for phasing in
competition.
Ofgas will work closely with British Gas in tackling the issue, which is
among many questions which will be raised in a consultation document to be
published next month.
The consultation period will end in May, when the DTI will start preparing
the legislation to open up the residential market. The gas bill would need
to be ready for introduction in November and become law next summer if the
timetable is to be met. But the government has not given a commitment to
introducing it this year.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Tin mine confident as DTI cuts funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cornwall's last tin mining company, Carnon Consolidated, said yesterday that
it hoped to continue operating in spite of reports that the government is to
end vital financial support.
According to a leaked letter from Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry, the government has decided not to extend
any further loans to the company beyond the Pounds 23.4m advanced already.
The letter says that the DTI has decided that the project is 'in jeopardy'
and that Carnon has been unable to adjust its costs to the low price of tin.
Carnon's directors told the DTI in November that they needed Pounds 200,000
before the end of January to keep going.
However, the company said yesterday that the tin price had strengthened and
it was confident it could operate profitably. The DTI declined to comment on
the leaked letter.
Carnon, based near Truro, employs 250 people, and another 250 jobs depend on
its supplying companies. According to the Sainsbury letter, the DTI is
concerned about the unemployment and possible environmental harm. One of
Carnon's earlier abandoned mines, Wheal Jane, leaked two years ago,
polluting the Falmouth Estuary.
Mr Matthew Taylor, local Liberal Democrat MP, said the government should
learn from Wheal Jane, where they saved a small sum of money by letting the
mine close, only to spend a large sum on unemployment pay and environmental
clean-up.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Fresh review for Rosyth naval base
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence has told employees at the Rosyth naval base in Fife
that it is once again reviewing its future. The base adjoins the Rosyth
naval dockyard, whose future was last summer guaranteed until 2005.
The base, which employs 1,800 civilians and involves 4,000 naval personnel
on land and at sea, was reprieved from closure in July 1991.
The review follows a statement in December by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, who said he was setting up a study to look at ways of reducing
the forces' spending on back-up services to meet heavy cuts in the defence
budget from 1996.
On current plans the civilian workforce will drop from its present 1,800 to
1,300 by April next year, the MoD said.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Toyota says it will increase US car production by 25 per
cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota said yesterday it would increase its US car production by about 25
per cent this year to 300,000 units. The move comes as Japanese motor groups
struggle against a depressed domestic market, but demand in the US market
appears to be recovering, Paul Abrahams reports.
The company is the second Japanese group to announce a substantial increase
in US production. Earlier this week, Honda said it intended to raise its
output 18.4 per cent to a record 597,000 this year.
Toyota's planned US production increase is in sharp contrast to its domestic
production last year, badly hit by the recession. Output of cars, trucks,
and buses fell 9.4 per cent to 3.56m.

FT  22 JAN 94 / US and China to extend economic links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China and the US have agreed to extend economic co-operation following a
visit to Beijing by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary.
Mr Bentsen and China's finance minister, Mr Liu Zhongli, reinstated annual
sessions of the Joint Economic Committee to assist closer contact.
Yesterday's was the first session of the JEC since before the 1989 Tiananmen
massacre.
But Mr Bentsen also repeated his warning that Beijing could not take
continued improvement in Sino-US relations for granted. He told senior
Chinese officials that further economic co-operation depended on progress on
human rights.
'There's been progress (on human rights) but more has to be done,' he said.
Mr Bentsen was referring to conditions outlined last year by President Bill
Clinton for renewal this year of China's Most Favoured Nation trading
status, which facilitates access to the vast US market through lower
tariffs.
Mr Clinton has called for 'overall, significant progress,' including
improved conditions in Chinese prisons, the release of political prisoners,
an end to the practice of exporting prison-made items and more sensitive
treatment of Tibet.
Among issues agreed at yesterday's JEC meeting between Mr Bentsen and Mr Liu
were:
The establishment of three joint working groups to meet twice yearly to
examine monetary and banking issues, exchange system reform and investment
and economic co-operation.
A visit to China this year by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, to advise on monetary reform and other issues.
A Chinese undertaking to improve access to the Chinese market for foreign
'financial institutions'. Banks will be allowed 'on an experimental basis'
to engage in local currency-denominated business.
The two sides also pledged to join in efforts to strengthen regional
economic co-operation 'aimed at promoting sustained growth'. China has
agreed to attend a meeting of finance ministers from the member countries of
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum.
Mr Bentsen's arrival in Beijing followed a review of policy which concluded
it was in the US interest to 're-engage' the Chinese leadership, especially
on economic issues.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Boost to Japan's economy delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Japanese political fiasco further delays government plans for an
urgently needed Y13,000bn (Pounds 78bn) spending and tax reduction package,
which was expected early next week.
Securities houses are accordingly bracing themselves for a fall in share
prices when the Tokyo market, closed by the time the vote came through,
opens on Monday. It was unclear last night when the government would be able
to table the package, and whether parliament would find time to legislate on
the draft proposals.
'It just means more delay and uncertainty,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief
economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, will meanwhile be bracing himself
for an awkward meeting tomorrow with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary, who has decided to add Japan to a round-the-world tour, to urge
Tokyo to make progress in stimulating the economy. The vote also casts a
shadow over next week's two-day meeting between US and Japanese officials in
Washington on how to reduce Tokyo's stubbornly high trade surplus.
Japan's political confusion will encourage a stronger yen, because continued
weakness of domestic demand will contribute to a wide trade surplus, said
Tokyo economists. That will provide an extra drag on Japan's export-oriented
economy. The delay of the economic package will encourage bonds to
strengthen, since it puts pressure on the Bank of Japan to trim official
interest rates in the absence of other measures to stimulate the economy,
economists said.
In London yesterday the dollar fell sharply against the yen in response to
the vote, falling from a London close of Y111.510 on Thursday to under Y110
before recovering to close at Y111.210. Analysts said the late recovery was
probably the result of traders selling off profitable yen positions.
By late yesterday in London, the Japanese government bond future on Liffe
was up a  1/2 -point from Thursday's close at 115.98. The markets had until
yesterday bargained on a package said by government officials to be
potentially worth more than Y13,000bn. That would be the fourth economic
stimulus since August 1992, worth just over Y30,000bn so far. The Y13,200bn
plan was expected to include tax cuts worth Y6,000bn-Y7,000bn, plus Y5,000bn
of public works spending and government land purchases.

To sentence four men to death in a summary trial, to jail 1,000 innocent
people for up to seven years after court hearings lasting as little as a
minute, and to sack the police chief of the capital along with several
junior officers might seem an exagerrated response to the death of a single
student in a brawl.
In Burma - where these actions were taken this month by the military junta,
according to the official media and diplomats in Rangoon - such harshness
and disregard for the due process of law barely raised a few eyebrows.
The generals who have ruled Burma for three decades are believed to have
acted with particular speed and severity to appease the dead man's
fellow-students because a similar incident involving the stabbing of a
student at a tea-shop sparked the pro-democracy uprising of 1988.
Five years after crushing that uprising by killing thousands of Burmese
civilians, the junta, now known as the State Law and Order Restoration
Council (Slorc), looks more powerful than ever.
The rebel armies of ethnic groups along the borders, such as the Karen and
the Kachin, have reluctantly agreed to negotiate ceasefires with the
government after years of guerrilla warfare.
Foreign businessmen, especially from Singapore and Thailand, are providing
Burma's generals with much-needed foreign currency by investing in hotels
and other projects. Border trade with China is helping the Burmese economy
to grow by as much as 6 per cent a year; Japan and the European Union are
considering the resumption of humanitarian aid hitherto suspended in protest
at the regime's human rights abuses.
Organised domestic opposition to the Slorc has been crushed. Some of the 700
delegates to the national convention, a gathering appointed to rubber-stamp
a new constitution entrenching the power of the armed forces, almost whimper
with fear when spoken to by foreign journalists.
It is easy to understand why. Mr Aung Khin Sint was jailed for 20 years last
year because he had the temerity to remind his fellow-delegates that they
had a duty to the Burmese people, a cryptic message taken to mean that they
should stand up for their democratic beliefs at the convention.
Buddhist monks, another group regarded as potentially dangerous by the
Slorc, have either been imprisoned or bought off with gifts of televisions
and endowments for their monasteries.
No-one expected the Slorc suddenly to hand over power to civilians and take
a back seat, but foreign diplomats are surprised that the increase of the
junta's economic and political power over the past two years has not given
the generals a greater sense of security or encouraged them to prepare a
more liberal constitution.
The outline of the new constitution now being drafted not only gives the
military a role in the executive, the legislative and the judiciary, and in
all levels of government from the national to the local, but also gives the
armed forces complete autonomy in all military matters (including the
defence budget) and the right to declare an emergency and take power
whenever they please.
'Really, they are in such a strong position that they can give away a lot
more than they have,' said one diplomat.
Members of the Slorc, in an attempt to whip up popular support and justify
the continued house arrest of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader,
trumpet the army's nationalist credentials and repeatedly condemn supposed
'neo-colonialist' and 'imperialist' plots.
Government officials criticise Ms Suu Kyi for having married a foreigner (a
Briton) and the draft constitution bars those with foreign spouses from
becoming president.
The junta's latest political creation, a successor to failed pro-military
political parties of the past, is the Union Solidarity and Development
Association (Usda), a mass movement with civilian leaders whose activities -
usually ending with 'rousing cheers' and 'tumultuous chanting of slogans' -
have been reported in the state media every day since its foundation last
September.
Most of those attending Usda rallies are civil servants or schoolchildren
given the day off work; before one such rally in Rangoon recently, pupils
were told they would fail their exams if they did not go.
Burma and Usda are often compared with Indonesia and its ruling party
Golkar. Burma's generals have acknowledged they aspire to the influential if
relatively discreet role of the army in Indonesia.
The main difference - which may explain why the Burmese junta remains so
insecure - is that the army in Burma is much more unpopular than its
Indonesian counterpart.

FT  22 JAN 94 / The comedians have the last laugh

<TEXT>
'It's unbelievable,' sighed Mr Yutaka Shimomura, an upper house MP, overcome
with relief after the unexpected defeat of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa's political reform bill yester-day.
Mr Shimomura, a comedian by profession, is dead serious when it comes to
politics. Clad in a formal brown kimono, he sternly cast his green ballot
against the bill yesterday with a dignified manner.
It may be the first time in Japan's postwar history that small, obscure
parties such as his Niin Club, a loose coalition of three comedians and two
independent MPs, have been pushed into the limelight.
The coalition and opposition parties, desperate for votes, have tried to woo
upper house members from the entertainment and athletic patch - those
traditionally snubbed because their popularity is based on their jokes or
their wrestling techniques rather than their policies.
Mr Shimomura claims that his party is the 'conscience of the upper house'.
'We've got to show people that the upper house is not just a shadow of the
lower house,' he says.
The Niin Club has opposed the political reform bills because the small
constituencies created by them would put smaller parties at a disadvantage.
The larger parties make the same claims.
Mr Hosokawa managed to win votes from the Sports Peace party, formed by Mr
Antonio Inoki, a square-chinned professional wrestler, and Mr Takenori
Emoto, a former baseball star. However, the Niin Club firmly resisted the
faxes and telephone calls from coalition parties, announcing last week that
they would oppose the bill.
But although Mr Shimomura is delighted by the bill's defeat, he now faces
the prospect of having to accept the compromise bills from the Liberal
Democratic party, the leading opposition. 'The LDP's version of political
reform is worse,' he says.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Record annual trade surplus leaves economists disappointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus rose to a record Dollars 120.4bn (Pounds 81.3bn) in
1993, 15.5 per cent higher than forecast and up 13.6 per cent on 1992.
The 1993 figure exceeded the previous record of Dollars 106.63bn, achieved
the year before.
The finance ministry statistics will provide the US with further ammunition
in its efforts to press Japan into stimulating the economy and opening
Japanese markets to imports.
Japanese exports to the US during December exceeded American imports by
Dollars 5.4bn, a rise of 17.3 per cent. The surplus, described by economists
as surprising and disappointing, was up from Dollars 11.2bn to Dollars
12.9bn. Japanese exports in the month were Dollars 32.7bn, while imports
were Dollars 19.8bn.
Mr James Vestal, BZW's chief economist in Japan, said currency movements had
distorted the figures. In yen terms, exports had declined and imports
increased.
Meanwhile, the gravity of Japan's recession was underlined by figures on
money supply, up only 1.5 per cent in December compared with the same month
last year. The data, published by the Bank of Japan, were in line with
expectations.
A broader measure of liquidity, which includes postal savings, government
bonds and investment trusts, increased 2.9 per cent in December compared
with 12 months previously.
'This shows the economy is still bumping along the bottom. Public bank
lending has increased 12 per cent, but this represents only a fifth of all
lending. Private bank lending to individuals and small businesses is up only
0.5 per cent,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in
Tokyo. 'The question is whether private banking is subdued because of lack
of demand, or because of a credit squeeze by the banks. I believe it's
mainly the demand side. Once private bank lending picks up, we'll know the
economy is heading for recovery.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Upper House reform vote astonishes ruling parties: Coalition
in disarray after unexpectedly widespread revolt by dissident Socialists

<TEXT>
The atmosphere in the normally sedate corridors of the diet building was one
of astonishment and disarray.
Representatives of Japan's coalition government were visibly shaken by
yesterday's vote against political reform.
'We did not even dream that such a thing could happen,' said Mr Kozo
Watanabe, of the Japan New party.
Of the dissident Socialists who scuppered the legislation, he said: 'It may
be that the awareness of their responsibility as the governing party was not
strong enough.'
Socialist leaders quickly gathered behind closed doors to assess the
situation.
In the opposition camp leaders relished the victory. Mr Kazuo Shii, head of
the Japan Communist party's secretariat, pronounced the outcome as 'a
reflection of the people's will'.
In a combative mood though as solemn as ever, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP leader,
emphasised the seriousness of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's
responsibility.
'He failed in his first promise to enact the reform bills by the end of the
year and he is about to fail in his second promise to do so by the end of
the emergency diet session.'
Mr Hosokawa managed to maintain his aristocratic composure as he emphasised
the government's continued commitment to reform.
The confusion which followed the upper house vote had broken an uneasy
tension which had hung heavily over the Assembly Hall during the hour
leading up to the final result.
Last-minute attempts by both sides to tip the balance had continued as
representatives of the coalition and opposition parties had come to the
podium to present their cases for and against the reforms.
Senior members of the LDP and Socialist parties alike had left the Assembly
Hall from time to time with prospective rebels on each side to make a final
plea to those expected to hold the casting vote.
It was not until the very last minute, when the votes had been counted and
re-counted, that the uncertainty was cleared by the surpris - ingly large
number of Socialist rebels who had voted against the reforms, a historic
change the public had been waiting for.
On the streets, many citizens expressed frustration with both the government
and the opposition for their failure to enact the reform bills.
'What have they been doing for the past 60 days using taxpayers' money?'
asked one middle-aged man who was angered by the news.
'There are so many important things that need to be done, particularly
economic reform,' he said.
'The LDP should also co-operate and ensure that the reforms pass so that the
government can move on to other things.'

FT  22 JAN 94 / Russian submarine sale to N Korea to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday launched an
investigation into allegations that a small Tokyo-based company had arranged
the sale of 12 Russian attack submarines to North Korea, write Paul Abrahams
in Tokyo and John Burton in Seoul.
The ministry said the Japanese embassy in Moscow had asked the Russian
government for an explanation of the sale. It has also approached a
Tokyo-based group, understood to be Toen Trading Company, about the
transaction.
The Russian authorities had explained the submarines were obsolete, having
been built in the 1960s, and were being sold as scrap, said the ministry.
Russia said the contract for the 12 diesel-powered Foxtrot-class submarines
required that Russian officials supervise dismantling of the vessels, which
are being delivered without weapons or important core components.
Only one submarine had so far been towed from the Russian Pacific Fleet's
base in Vladivostok to North Korea, according to the Russians.
There would be no legal problems for Toen if it had sold the submarines as
scrap, but if not, the group could be prosecuted under the foreign exchange
and foreign trade law, Miti said .
South Korea expressed concern this week that Russia had broken a 1992 pledge
not to supply military equipment to North Korea after Japanese newspapers
reported that Pyongyang had purchased the decommissioned Russian submarines
through a small Japanese trading house.
Some analysts believe North Korea may try to cannibalise the submarines for
spare parts to keep in service its fleet of 25 ageing Whiskey- and
Romeo-class submarines, which are approaching the end of their operational
life.
But South Korea was told by the US military that there was only a slim
chance that North Korea could recover parts for use in its other submarines.
South Korea is worried that operational deployment of the submarines would
negate its efforts to establish parity with the North's submarine fleet.
South Korea's first submarine, a modern German-designed Type 209-class
vessel, entered service last year.

Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief constitutional negotiator, took second place

FT  22 JAN 94 / Brazilian scandal inquiry concludes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The committee investigating a corruption racket in Brazil's congress
yesterday recommended the expulsion of at least 18 congressmen, including
two of the country's most senior politicians.
The committee's report also highlighted the role in the scandal of nine
construction companies. This is likely to add to pressure for a new inquiry
into links between politicians and the companies, among Brazil's most
powerful.
In an exhausting session which was set to last until late last night, and
which was tinged by security fears in case any accused politicians reacted
violently to the report's findings, the committee heard the final
conclusions of three months of hearings.
The corruption scandal involved politicians taking 'fees' in return for
approving construction projects within the government's annual budget. The
committee also traced other irregularities, including illegal campaign
funding, from politicians' bank accounts. According to some estimates, more
than Dollars 80m was diverted to members of the scheme.
The findings will now be passed to the judiciary for further investigation
and possible legal action. The proposed expulsion of the congressmen will be
put to the vote in Congress, probably next month.
The latest scandal has been seen as a continuation of a political clean-up
started by the ousting of former President Fernando Collor. Although it has
won wide public backing, support for the inquiry has wavered in recent days
amid accusations that some guilty politicians used their influence to avoid
investigation, a claim committee members denied.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Odinga, fighter for Kenyan independence and democracy:
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya has lost one of its few remaining national leaders with the death of
Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, 82, the country's veteran opposition leader, after
suffering a heart attack at his home outside Nairobi on Thursday, his family
announced yesterday.
Late in life, Kenya's campaign for multi-party democracy galvanised him with
the same conviction with which he had fought for the end of colonial rule
three decades before.
In between, Odinga's independence of spirit, and an irrepressible habit of
speaking his mind, earned him spells in jail and in the political
wilderness. His exclusion from power, however, did not dent his popular
following.
He could have been Kenya's first president. While Jomo Kenyatta, the
country's founding father, was still in colonial jails, Odinga spurned
covert offers from the British to groom him for power.
Kenyatta rewarded his loyalty with the vice-presidency after independence in
1963. But disenchantment with the way Kenyatta began to amass illicit wealth
and policy differences led Odinga to resign from the government in 1966.
Branded a communist for his close ties to China and his opposition to a
pro-western foreign policy, he disagreed with Kenyatta's decision to
purchase land from white settlers for the African population, instead of
expropriating it.
He left the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) party to found the
Kenya People's Union, which was soon proscribed. He spent the late 1960s in
prison and thereafter endured long spells under house arrest.
Kanu made several attempts to lure him back to the fold, but Odinga's strong
speeches denouncing corruption and abuse of public office rendered any
rapprochement impossible.
Disillusionment with Daniel arap Moi's government, and a campaign for
multi-party democracy, gave Odinga a second lease of life. He was among the
reformist politicians who founded the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy
(Ford), the focal point for the pro-democracy campaign that culminated in
the legalisation of opposition parties in 1991.
Ford, however, was unable to sustain its unity. Odinga, was a member of
Kenya's second largest tribe, the Luo, and his rivalry with Kenneth Matiba,
of the larger Kikuyu tribe, eventually splintered the movement. The division
of the opposition along ethnic lines opened the way for President Moi's
re-election in December 1992.
Kenya had a tumultuous first year of democracy, with corruption scandals
rocking the government and Odinga, leader of the opposition in parliament,
spearheading the campaign for good governance.
His reputation, however, suffered a fatal blow last year when he admitted to
receiving political funds from a local banking group that was shut down for
fraud and embezzlement. Several leading members of his party, Ford-Kenya,
resigned in protest.
Perhaps sensing that his end was drawing near, Odinga became a conciliatory
figure in his final months of life.
He praised President Moi and spoke of the need to maintain national unity in
the face of mounting ethnic violence. He never explained his sudden change
of heart.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Fears of violence grow as quake victims wait for aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of violence were rising in Los Angeles yesterday amid desperate
efforts to find shelter for the thousands of people who have camped in parks
and open spaces since last Monday's earthquake.
'There has been incredible destruction of residential property,' said
Senator Diane Feinstein, who as mayor of San Francisco oversaw relief
efforts for the 1989 earthquake there. 'The destruction here is far more
significant and long-range,' she said.
Frustrations were rising as victims complained about the lack of immediate
assistance. Thousands queued outside emergency centres that opened on
Thursday to distribute financial aid. Most received only an application form
and an appointment to return days or even weeks later. To deter unrest,
about two dozen riot gear-clad National Guard troops armed with M-16 rifles
patrolled the area round the Winnetka Community Centre in Northridge, near
the epicentre of the quake.
Another problem facing victims is the exorbitant prices that some stores are
charging for basic necessities. 'I had to pay Dollars 5 (Pounds 3.30) for a
can of soup and Dollars 9 for a bag of charcoal,' complained Mr Larry
Chisom, a young man with a wife, baby and mother to support. Still without
electricity and gas, he is cooking on a barbecue. Others say that they have
had to pay Dollars 10 for a gallon of water.
The city has established a telephone hot-line for consumer complaints, but
Mr Chisom and his friends think there may be a better solution. 'This is
going to bring out criminal instincts. Those store owners will regret it,'
he said.
Although there has been remarkably little crime or looting in Los Angeles,
concerns are mounting about the potential for civil unrest in a city torn by
riots two years ago.
The death toll yesterday rose to 55. The number of injured rose to 5,700, of
whom about 700 sustained serious injuries. At least 36,000 residents are
without water and thousands of homes still have no electricity.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Syrian president's son dies in car crash

Bassel al-Assad, the eldest son of President Hafez al-Assad and widely
assumed to be the Syrian leader's political heir, died yesterday in a car
crash, according to an official statement from Damascus.
The statement announced the death 'with deep grief and sadness' of the
33-year-old, the oldest of Mr Assad's four sons, in a 'tragic accident'.
Bassel, who was being groomed for a leading political role in Syria,
graduated from Damascus University with an engineering degree in 1985. He
spoke several languages and was an accomplished horseman, winning a gold
medal at the 1987 Mediterranean games held in Lattakia, northern Syria. He
also served as an army officer, training as a parachutist and reaching the
rank of major.
However, despite his increasing appearances at the presidential palace from
the mid-1980s, he is not thought to have held any central political
responsibility within the Syrian regime. Many observers in Damascus believe
that in the event of his succession to the presidency, real power would have
resided elsewhere among senior military officers.
His death is certain to raise the awkward question of Mr Assad's succession,
however, with the 63-year-old president far from perfect health.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Three Belgian ministers quit amid bribery allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Belgium's biggest political scandal yesterday claimed its first three
ministerial victims, including the country's deputy prime minister, who
resigned his post under mounting political and media pressure.
Mr Guy Coeme, who also held the communications portfolio, announced his
resignation minutes before attending a parliamentary committee to reject
allegations of forgery and illegal acts connected with the award of a
government helicopter contract in 1988.
His announcement was quickly followed by the resignations of two other
leading French-speaking socialists, Mr Guy Spitaels, head of the regional
government of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon interior minister.
Mrs Veronique Ancia, a Liege magistrate, wants to interview the trio about
allegations that bribes were promised to their party in return for awarding
the BFr8bn (Pounds 150m) helicopter contract to Agusta, the Italian aircraft
maker.
All three have denied any wrongdoing, but the affair had begun to undermine
confidence in the government and take its toll on the Belgian currency and
bonds. Analysts said yesterday that Mr Coeme's resignation was positive for
the government in the short term. However, the national coalition of French-
and Dutch-speaking Socialists and Christian Democrats will come under
renewed pressure if the francophone Socialist party is weakened by further
allegations.
In his resignation statement, Mr Coeme said he was 'disgusted' by the way in
which he had been 'hounded' by the opposition and by the media, which had
'fed on rumours, lies and slanders' and prevented him carrying out his
ministerial duties. 'I'm clear-headed enough not to want the government to
suffer from this,' he said, adding that his conscience was clear and his
innocence would be proved.
Both Mr Spitaels and Mr Mathot reaffirmed their innocence yesterday, and
said they regretted that the affair had become politically charged. The
opposition Flemish Liberals in particular have been calling for
resignations.
A special parliamentary committee last week lifted the immunity of Mr
Spitaels, party leader until early 1992, and Mr Mathot. Mrs Ancia is likely
to interview them next month. A separate committee yesterday began
questioning Mr Coeme, who was defence minister at the time the contract was
awarded. It has to decide whether to send him before Belgium's supreme court
to explain his role in the affair. It was not clear yesterday how his
resignation as a minister would affect the procedure.
Belgium's government faces two tests of electoral support this year at the
European elections in June and in municipal elections in October.
Mrs Ancia's investigation centres on the Socialist stronghold of Liege in
Wallonia, which stood to benefit most from the Agusta contract. Agusta
itself has always denied involvement in illegal financial dealings.
Speaking yesterday before the resignations were announced, Mr Michel
Daerden, president of the Liege regional Socialist party, conceded that only
a clear outcome to Mrs Ancia's inquiries would end the suspicions of the
public about party financing. But he added that he was afraid such clarity
would not be achieved before the local elections.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks aimed at an unprecedented international agreement to cut global
aluminium output ran into unexpected problems yesterday.
Delegates from the main producing countries ended three days of talks with a
marathon 26-hour session, which broke up yesterday without agreement. The
indications were that the talks had been prolonged by US lawyers combing
through an outline agreement to ensure it did not breach US anti-trust laws.
The delegates went into the negotiations, scheduled to last for only Tuesday
and Wednesday this week, with the aim of cutting world annual aluminium
production by 1.5m-2m tonnes for up to two years so as to restore the market
to balance. It has been badly disturbed by the collapse of demand in the
former Soviet Union, where more than half the metal produced went to the
military. As the military no longer requires it and Russia, the world's
second largest producer, is in desperate need of foreign currency, the
aluminium has been exported in ever-increasing quantities, driving up stocks
and sending prices plummeting by half.
The talks this week are aimed at deciding how output cuts might be between
the main producers. Taking part with Russia and the US, the world's biggest
producer, are Canada, the European Union, Norway and Australia.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Venezuela relaxes bank rules in wake of Banco Latino
collapse
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government has moved to ease concerns that last week's
failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, could spark a
widespread financial crisis.
The administration yesterday began introducing less stringent rules covering
reserve requirements in the banking system, and offered broad financial
assistance to banks suffering from temporary liquidity problems.
Some Venezuelan banks have had to cope with abnormally large withdrawals
since Banco Latino was taken over by the government on January 16. Moreover,
the bank's many subsidiary and affiliate financial institutions have
suspended their operations. Latino's subsidiary bank in Florida declared
bankruptcy on Thursday.
Rumours about problems at domestic banks have increased in recent days,
provoking nervous withdrawals at several financial institutions.
Earlier this week the government announced that Banco Latino would re-open
on January 28 to begin paying off depositors with small accounts. But it was
far from clear if the bank would resume any other activities over the short
term.
President Ramon Velasquez, announcing the banking measures on Thursday
night, said that Mr Julio Santodomingo, formerly an executive with Banco de
Venezuela, would head a four-member government-appointed board to run Banco
Latino. A group of presidents from eight big banks would also work with the
government to implement the bank's rescue programme.
The president also revealed that he had accepted the resignations of two key
officials, the Superintendent of Banks, Mr Roger Urbina (who was appointed
to take over Banco Latino only last Sunday), and the head of the
government's deposit guarantee fund, Ms Esperanza Martino.
The resignations came after business people demanded to know why the
president waited until it was too late to take action on Banco Latino, since
his government knew about its problems for some time. Stung by the
criticism, Mr Velasquez said he had to rely on information provided by Mr
Urbina and other government figures.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Bundesbank chief prescribes more belt-tightening
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Painful changes in German pay and public spending policies must continue for
some years if economic growth is to be sustained, Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
Bundesbank president, said yesterday.
'Cyclical recovery alone is not sufficient. The necessary corrections must
be achieved in the medium term no matter how much they hurt,' he said in a
speech in Hamburg.
Speaking as wage negotiations started in Stuttgart on behalf of 3.5m public
sector employees, he stressed it was not the task of monetary policy to
'correct the mistakes and failings of others'. Pay negotiators and
politicians had made a start, but they would have to do more, he said.
The oTV public sector union yesterday formally tabled a claim for a 4 per
cent award, offering to accept less in return for limits on job losses.
The employers, represented by federal and regional ministers, have for
months warned that they want a 'zero' settlement in the light of the
spending restraint demanded by the Bundesbank. Indications from other
settlements suggested that the result would depend on the negotiators'
definition of 'zero'. Any award of less than 3 per cent - the expected
inflation rate this year - would result in a real loss of earnings.
A recent deal in the chemicals industry, worth a nominal 1.5 per cent, was
mirrored earlier this week in a similar settlement for paper workers.
Analysts said anything more for public servants, many of whom are guaranteed
jobs for life by their civil servant status, was unlikely.
While industrial union claims so far have focused as usual on percentage
increases, employers have concentrated on trying to change working
practices. The chemical union's acceptance of working times adjustable
according to demand, and of below-basic pay for new hirings, has raised
hopes of similar flexibility in other sectors.
At banking sector talks, which entered the second round yesterday, employers
demanded more flexible working times and freedom for individuals to elect to
work part-time.
Engineering employers want to adapt the incoming standard 35-hour week to
allow employees to work between 30 and 40 hours according to market
conditions. Although the powerful IG Metall engineering union this week
threatened national warning strikes if employers continued to avoid
discussing its claim for up to 6 per cent, industrial leaders were unmoved.
They appeared determined to exploit fears of unemployment caused by the
lingering recession to press through change, despite signs that the low
point has been passed. As Mr Tietmeyer noted yesterday, export demand in
October and November last year was 7.5 per cent higher than a year earlier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong, in an effort to break an acrimonious deadlock with China over its
ambitious new airport, offered to sweeten the deal by putting in more of its
own capital, Sir Hamish Macleod, the financial secretary, said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
He was speaking as legislators approved by a vote of 38-2 the government's
request for further funds for the USDollars 20.5bn (Pounds 13.8bn) project,
caught up in the row over Governor Chris Patten's efforts to bring greater
democracy to Hong Kong before the 1997 handover.
They voted for a HKDollars 1.29bn (Pounds 112m) allotment for the next stage
of construction and agreed to a government request for a further HKDollars
377m for day-to-day costs.
Sir Hamish said the government still sought China's approval - vital if the
airport is to attract international financing at attractive rates - but
would press on with construction work meanwhile.
Beijing has rejected two financing packages for the airport, arguing that
they would leave Hong Kong with a debt mountain on its reversion to China in
1997.
But many in Hong Kong believe China is attempting to use the airport, one of
the largest infrastructure projects in Asia, to press Mr Patten to abandon
his plans for democratic reform.
The government earlier rejected a halt to construction in the hope of
reaching agreement with China.

Russia's new parliament, in which communists, conservatives and extreme
nationalists outnumber moderates, yesterday called for the lifting of
sanctions against Serbia and opposed threatened Nato air strikes against the
Bosnian Serbs.
The State Duma (parliament) passed a pro-Serb motion by 280 votes to two,
warning that the use of force by the western powers would not only fail to
end the war, but could raise the conflict to 'a higher level of ferocity and
confrontation'.
Meanwhile, France and the United Nations mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
yesterday followed the British government in staunchly defending Lord Owen,
the European Union's representative in the deadlocked Bosnian peace talks,
after the European Parliament demanded his removal.
The French Foreign Ministry said France, which has the largest contingent of
peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia, fully backed Lord Owen's
efforts to negotiate a peace settlement between the three warring factions.
'He is acting with great perseverance in accordance with the directives of
the European Union countries,' the ministry said.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, was consulting his European
colleagues by telephone on what steps to take after the latest failure of
the Bosnian peace talks in Geneva and will review policy with Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Paris on Monday.
In a statement issued in Geneva, Mr Stoltenberg said that 'nobody has put
more effort or been more committed to finding peace in the former
Yugoslavia, over a longer period than Lord Owen. He cannot be criticised for
the situation that exists today.'
Lord Owen admitted in London on Thursday it was 'an open secret' that he
wanted to quit, but said that he had no intention of abandoning his job
while EU foreign ministers wanted him to stay on.
Mr Hans van den Broek, the European Commissioner for external affairs, has
also distanced himself from the European Parliament's demand for Lord Owen's
resignation, but called for a suspension of the international mediating
efforts in Yugoslavia.
In a speech to the parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday, the former Dutch
foreign minister said the real responsibility for policy on Bosnia lay with
the European Union itself.
Since the conflict in Bosnia broke out two years ago, Mr van den Broek has
urged the west to punish Serb aggression and to avoid forcing the Moslems to
conclude a peace deal leaving them without a viable country.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, in a radio interview in
London, said there was no question of British troops being pulled out of
Bosnia during the winter months. Nor was there any likelihood of Britain
pulling out its forces unilaterally.
'What we are talking about is whether the UN as a whole should continue to
be in Bosnia.'
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Croatia yesterday announced the imminent
restoration of telephone links with Serbia, cut off during the six-month war
in 1991, following the agreement to normalise relations in this week's
Geneva talks.

<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, launched his new government
yesterday with a pledge to support Russia's ailing industries - lending
weight to claims by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the outgoing finance minister, that
Russia was abandoning fiscal discipline.
Mr Valentin Sergeyev, the prime minister's spokesman, said the government's
reform programme contained only 'elements of western market economics',
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
'The mechanical transfer of western economic methods to Russian soil has
caused more harm than good,' Mr Sergeyev quoted Mr Chernomyrdin as saying.
He said the economic programme, which had been approved by President Boris
Yeltsin, would be based on the 'special characteristics of our state, people
and Russian traditions'.
Economists in the west and Russia continued to express anxiety at the
exclusion of key reformers from Russia's new government. In Washington,
President Bill Clinton said he did not believe reform was over in Russia.
'What we're concerned about, obviously, is whether they'll be able to manage
their inflation problem,' he said.
The International Monetary Fund said it might delay sending a team to Moscow
for talks because there might be no finance minister to talk to, while Group
of Seven representatives conferred anxiously on the government's policy
shift.
Two prominent western economists, Mr Jeffrey Sachs and Mr Anders Aslund,
resigned as advisers to the government. The two men, who have increasingly
been seen as foreign meddlers by Russian conservatives, said they strongly
opposed the new government's aims.
Even within the government, concerns were being expressed, with Mr Sergei
Krasavchenko, the radical deputy head of the president's administration,
saying he was 'seriously anxious' about the consequences of Mr Fyodorov's
resignation.
Mr Fyodorov denied that he had been forced to leave for embracing
over-radical reform. 'It's not a question of radical reform. It's just
fiscal discipline.'
Mr Fyodorov said the new government would remain too vulnerable to pressure
for handouts it could not afford. That would only encourage enterprises and
individual regions to ask for more money, and contribute to the huge debts
between enterprises that deliver goods without demanding payment. He also
warned of corruption.

FT  22 JAN 94 / PM backs CrossRail despite Treasury opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister has decided to push ahead with plans to build CrossRail,
the Pounds 2bn east-west railway link beneath central London.
It is understood that Mr John Major overruled an attempt by Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to block the project. Mr
Major and a group of senior ministers decided to back - and even extend -
plans to build the CrossRail link, central London's biggest public transport
project since the Victoria Line opened 25 years ago.
The project would enable passengers travelling on suburban trains into
British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to reach the West
End and the City without having to change to the Underground system.
However, ministers say that Mr Portillo and some Treasury officials raised
strong objections to the project, to be jointly funded by the public and
private sectors. The exchequer's share of the cost would be about Pounds
1bn.
It is understood that Mr Portillo argued at a meeting on Thursday that the
project should be deferred because of cost. He backed suggestions that
commuter congestion might be relieved more cheaply by developing existing
Underground stations.
But the meeting, which was attended by Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, and Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, overruled this and
decided to allow the CrossRail construction plans to be examined at a
committee stage of the House of Commons on Tuesday.
It was also agreed to link the line to six London stations, one more than at
first envisaged. The additional station is Holborn. The CrossRail line will
pass from Paddington in west London to Liverpool Street in the east.
The decision to push ahead with the project was welcomed yesterday by London
First, a business-led initiative to promote London. Mr Stephen O'Brien, its
chief executive, said: 'We are absolutely delighted the government is not
going for a truncated version of CrossRail.' However, the decision may be
seen as a defeat for Mr Portillo.
Technical plans for CrossRail have been drawn up over the last four months
by British Rail and London Transport, two of the project's sponsors, as part
of a private bill being brought before parliament. They are confident that
once the bill reaches royal assent, it will receive financial backing from
the private sector.
A study carried out by the consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Bovis, says
the CrossRail project would provide private sector backers with a commercial
return, while guaranteeing the Treasury an 8 per cent return on the public
sector investment.

FT  22 JAN 94 / Economic growth outpaces forecast: Money supply grows
strongly - GDP up 2% / Boost for recovery lifts market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy grew faster than the government forecast last year, adding
weight to the Chancellor's view that the recovery is strengthening. The
figures came at the end of a week of conflicting economic indicators.
Gross domestic product increased by 2 per cent in 1993, the first calendar
year rise since 1990, according to preliminary estimates published by the
Central Statistical Office. GDP growth, which accelerated in the fourth
quarter, was above the 1.25 per cent forecast by the government in March and
1.75 per cent predicted in Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's November Budget.
Evidence of economic strength appeared to please the stock market yesterday,
although this week it has risen on hopes that a weakening recovery would
lead to lower interest rates. The FT-SE 100 index came close to topping
3,500, reaching an all-time intra-day high of 3,496.1. Although it fell
back, the index still rose 14.2 points on the day, ending at a record close
of 3,484.2.
This week the index gained 83.6 points or just under 2.5 per cent.
The GDP statistics, allied with reports of stronger-than-expected money
supply growth, were among positive indicators this week, countering a slight
fall in December's retail sales, and a British Chambers of Commerce report,
which had both indicated that recovery might be faltering.
However, Mr Clarke said yesterday: 'Two per cent growth in 1993 will be the
envy of every major country in western Europe; I trust we can do better in
1994.'
Total GDP rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter
of 1993, the seventh consecutive quarter of economic growth. The overall
increase since the fourth quarter is 2.5 per cent, slightly up on analysts'
expectations. The rise means that GDP has climbed 3.3 per cent since the
trough in the first quarter of 1992 and is finally back to the average level
for 1990, when the recession began.
Economic output was boosted by a strong performance from the oil and gas
sector. If oil and gas are excluded, then GDP rose just 0.5 per cent in the
fourth quarter, making it 2.1 per cent up on the same period of 1992.
Non-oil GDP in 1993 was 1.8 per cent higher than in 1992, but has not hit
pre-recessionary levels.
Growth was fairly broadly spread, the CSO indicated, the main exceptions
being agriculture, depressed because of the European Union's set-aside
policy, and construction, which was flat. Services are still performing more
strongly than manufacturing; total service output is now 1 per cent above
the previous peak in the second quarter of 1990.
Further evidence of growth was provided by M4, the broadest money supply
measure, which rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in December,
bringing the annual rate up to 5.5 per cent. The figures indicate that money
supply growth is accelerating; the annualised rise in the three months to
December is 9 per cent.
Sterling lending by banks and building societies to the private sector, M4
lending, rose sharply to Pounds 4.1bn in December, compared with Pounds 550m
in November. The year-on-year growth in M4 lending was 3.6 per cent in
December, up from 3 per cent in November.
Mortgage lending by building societies fell back in December. Net advances
declined to Pounds 624m, from November's Pounds 800m, while net new
commitments fell to Pounds 2.09bn from Pounds 2.78bn.

FT  22 JAN 94 / LWT loses US ally in Granada defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television's attempt to attract a white knight to help it
ward off the unwanted takeover bid from Granada has collapsed.
US West, the giant US telephone company and one of the largest cable
operators in the UK, was interested in a stake of 29.9 per cent in the
London ITV company - the largest amount possible without triggering a full
bid.
Talks continued all week with the Takeover Panel in order to obtain
permission for US West to approach LWT formally. The panel, it is
understood, refused to clear the approach on the grounds that it would have
constituted a concert party.
At the same time, it now looks highly unlikely that the Granada bid will be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, yesterday postponed a decision on referral,
but said he 'would expect it to be possible to resolve' concerns over the
concentration of advertising sales without the need for an MMC reference.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), declined to comment on
the US West talks, but said Granada's bid would fail at the current price.
Mr Heseltine's decision could also clear the way for the proposed
acquisition of Central by Carlton. He has asked the Office of Fair Trading
to ensure Carlton and Granada comply with certain conditions on selling
advertising airtime. These could include the divestment of interests in
advertising sales houses or a system of 'Chinese walls' between different
sales operations owned by the same company.
LWT said shareholders should urgently be given details of costs arising from
any unscrambling of sales arrangements. Granada and Carlton were confident
they would be able to comply with the conditions and that no referral would
be necessary.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, said: 'In our view we will be
able to satisfy the OFT.' Carlton said it was confident that any
undertakings would be consistent with its proposed acquisition.
Advertisers, who had feared that a concentration of advertising sales could
force up prices and lead to unacceptable 'strings' being attached to deals,
were also happy with Mr Heseltine's announcement.
Once the monopolies and mergers situation is clarified - Mr Heseltine has
set a deadline of January 28 for the parties to provide the assurances -
Granada is expected to improve its offer. The likely changes would be an
improvement to the cash alternative now standing at 528p per share and
deciding to pay final dividend to LWT shareholders.

FT  21 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness strong on deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise restructuring move by Guinness and LVMH sent the shares in the
former surging forward as drinks analysts hailed it as a fundamental change
in the stock's rating.
The deal, in which the French group reduces its holding in Guinness which in
turn switches its LVMH stake into Moet-Hennessy (owned by LVMH), was said to
go a long way to answering market criticisms of the UK group.
Chief among these was the potential instability threatened by LVMH, whose
media ambitions were seen increasingly at odds with those of Guinness. LVMH
has also given additional safeguards on its new 20 per cent holding.
Mr Andrew Holland at Kleinwort Benson, who yesterday moved Guinness off the
sell list for the first time in 18 months, said: 'The deal improves the long
term profit outlook at a time when they sorely need it.'
Guinness enthusiast Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said: 'This deal removes any
remaining uncertainties surrounding the stock. On a two-year view, Guinness
has got the best earnings growth potential in the sector.'
However, there was some consternation at Guinness's timing. After the
company spoke to some brokers last week, several analysts downgraded the
stock, one house apparently cutting its profits forecast and issuing a sell
note yesterday morning just as the restructuring news was announced.
The shares closed 49 up at 521p with a hefty 30m traded, the fourth highest
ever and the largest daily volume for two and half years.
There was no stopping the bull run in Standard Chartered shares, which
outpaced the rest of the banks sector, the FT-SE 100 Index and the wider
equity market as institutions focused on the bank's outstanding earnings
growth potential based on its pre-eminence in the Far East.
An ever-tightening stock shortage was also cited as helping to squeeze the
share price higher. Revived speculation of a possible takeover bid for the
bank was disregarded by some traders, who reported signs of panic buying by
marketmakers caught short of stock. 'Put simply, the shares were underpriced
and are now beginning to reflect the big upside potential in profits,' said
one dealer.
A welter of buying interest, both domestic and overseas, drove Standard
Chartered shares up 87, or 7 per cent, to a record close of 1316p, only
marginally below the all-time high of 1324p reached in mid-afternoon.
Turnover was an above average 1.6m shares.
Bank specialists said much of the heavyweight buying interest in the stock
had been triggered by the Cazenove buy recommendation issued on Wednesday,
which highlighted the stock's relative cheapness against others such as HSBC
and Bank of East Asia.
However, some of the market's more cautious analysts pointed out that
Standard shares outperformed the market by 20 per cent in 1992 and 75 per
cent in 1993, and that in the absence of a takeover bid the shares looked
fairly valued. Standard is due to announce preliminary results on March 9.
Shares in Kingfisher fell sharply as the stores group finally acceded to
pressure to make a trading statement in the wake of the recent Dixons
profits warning.
Although widely expected, weak sales at Comet and Darty and sluggish margins
still managed to shake investor confidence.
Analysts cut forecasts by around 5 per cent to about Pounds 300m. The
shares, which have had a strong run since the November Budget, checked only
by the Dixons news, are likely to be weak ahead of results in March. The
stock tumbled 37 to 678p with 10m shares traded. Dixons gained 4 at 222p.
Industrial gases group BOC bucked the market after surprising investors with
a restructuring package forecast to save Pounds 60m over the next three
years.
The restructuring will involve 1,700 staff losing their jobs worldwide and
Pounds 85m of provisions, but the market decided that all the bad news was
now out of the way and bought the shares, lifting them 33 to 699p.
Analysts cut their forecasts for this year by around Pounds 65m to between
Pounds 255m and Pounds 265m to take the provisions in to account, but raised
estimates for next year and 1996.
Chemicals group ICI came under further attack as UBS published a review with
a short-term sell recommendation attached.
The house told clients that the dismal state of the industry in continental
Europe, a Pounds 20m hit from adverse exchange rate movement, diminishing
scope for further cost cuts, and fears of an oil price rise, would hold the
company back. It sees the shares falling as low as 700p before yield
benefits kick in. Yesterday the stock surrendered 12 to 755 1/2 p.
Pharmaceutical stocks were under pressure following US selling that began
after Pfizer announced a sharp slowdown in sales late on Wednesday. Glaxo
was further affected by a downgrade from Kleinwort Benson and weakened 20 to
661p. SmithKline Beecham fell 7 to 432p and Zeneca 16 to 808p.
Speculation of further trouble in the stores sector circulated, with MFI
attracting attention as a potential candidate for reporting dull trading
news with its results in two weeks' time. The stock receded 7 1/2 to 168 1/2
p.
Bank shares ran ahead towards the close, with Bank of Scotland finally 7 1/2
higher at 232 1/2 p and Lloyds 2 harder at 646p after Kleinwort Benson buy
notes; and Barclays finishing 8 up at 617p, with Morgan Stanley said to be
about to publish a strong buy recommendation on the shares today.
In the composite insurances, Commercial Union benefited from switching out
of General Accident, the former settling 5 firmer at 693p and the latter 15
cheaper at 725p. Talk that one marketmaker had finally placed a line of 3m
shares in Sun Alliance saw the shares edge up 2 to 391p.
Disappointing new business figures unsettled Prudential, which retreated 12
to 364p, and London &amp; Manchester, 23 down at 413p.
Mining group RTZ forged ahead 31 1/2 to 876 1/2 p on the back of rising
metal prices.
Courtaulds Textiles dropped 32 to 536p when one agency broker attempted to
place a line of stock just as the steam went out of the Mid 250 Index.
United Newspapers slipped 9 to 673p in reaction to the latest newspaper
circulation figures, which showed that the group's Daily Express had been
hit by the Times price cuts.

FT  21 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices dip as confidence is
challenged - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism was punctured across the range of the UK stock market yesterday,
after the Bundesbank made no move on interest rates and the second line
stocks reacted from the tumult of the previous session. The blue chip stocks
moved nervously after hopes for an early cut in base rates found little
support from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, and it was left to specific
corporate situations to provide the features.
Confidence in the progress of the domestic economy was challenged before the
session by a gloomy report from the British Chambers of Commerce. Strength
in sterling also discouraged investors in the leading UK export companies.
The FT-SE 100 Index moved erratically, reflecting the new uncertainties in
the market following the significant outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250
Index since the turn of the year.
An early fall of 12 points on the FT-SE 100 was quickly recovered with the
help of the December contract in the stock index futures sector. A strong
gain in Guinness shares on the restructured link with LVMH, the French
luxury goods and drinks group, and in a handful of other leading stocks,
boosted the Footsie.
But support waned after the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council failed
to produce favourable news on interest rates, and the index soon showed a
net fall of 16 points. There was little significant selling, however, and
share prices steadied as Wall Street opened with a gain of 5 Dow points in
UK trading hours.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100-share Index at 3,470 for a final loss of
5.1 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which was driven ahead so strongly on
Wednesday by options-related dealings, fell steadily to close 43.4 off at
4,105.4.
Dealers said that, once again, the UK stock market appeared sharply divided.
The leading 100 stocks, which are dominated by the big fund managers, lacked
direction. Many managers wanted to increase investment in the Mid 250 range
which has outperformed the Footsie this month, but found it very difficult
to get cash into what are often extremely tight markets in these second line
issues.
Meanwhile, the uncertainty over the progress of the UK economy, and thus
over base rate prospects, left fund managers unsure of the outlook across
the blue chip sectors. This left investors to concentrate on specific
features, including Guinness, where nearly 30m shares traded, and in BOC,
RTZ and Standard Chartered.
Seaq volume remained very high at 1.11bn shares, with non-Seaq trade at
around 64 per cent of the total. In the previous session, retail value on
the Seaq volume of 1.32m shares fell to Pounds 1.13bn, reflecting the focus
on second line issues.
Traders admitted to concern over this week's developments in the Mid 250
stocks, which have been prompted by moves by a leading marketmaker to offer
warrants on the stocks, regarded as an attempt to offer a futures instrument
on the Mid 250 Index to follow the significant success of the future
contract on the FT-SE 100 Share Index.
The Footsie future has become an important driving force behind the Index
itself and the growth of interest in the Mid 250 range has brought
expectations that a similar instrument will be welcomed in this sector.
However, this week has reinforced worries over the market liquidity
supporting the FT-SE Mid 250 and 350 Indices.

FT  21 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dull but reflective session in the derivatives sector saw the Footsie
March future challenge but fail to break through the 3,500 barrier, though
turnover in the traded options remained high, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,485,
down 16 points from Wednesday's record close, and was followed by sporadic
selling which sent it lower. Several mid-morning buying orders brought about
a rally, which drove March strongly forward to the day's peak of 3,499,
after which it ran out of steam and drifted for the next few hours.
The failure of the Bundesbank to make any move on interest rates, flushed
out more sellers sending March to its low point of 3,471. It finished at
3,482. With the premium having been maintained throughout the session, the
closing level was 9 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about
6 points. Volume returned to more modest levels finishing at 11,962 lots.
Dealers said volatility in several FT-SE 100 stocks was responsible for
continued high volume in the traded options which saw a total of 50,153
contracts traded. Volume in FT-SE 100 options was significantly down at
10,335 lots against Wednesday's 25,082 but the Euro FT-SE 100 was busy,
trading 10,354 lots.
British Gas was the busiest stock option with a total of 6,005 contracts
following a big trade carried out by SG Warburg.
It was followed by Abbey National at 2,135 lots and Guinness at 1,881
contracts. BTR at 1,226 and Glaxo at 1,191 were the other stocks in the
league table.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs to fresh record
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Wall Street
The bellwether US blue chip index pushed further into record territory as
investors digested a fresh batch of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 7.59 up at 3,891.96, the fifth
consecutive all-time high. NYSE volume totalled 310.4m shares. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 firmed 0.68 to 474.98. The American SE composite put on 1.53 at
484.81, while rebounding technology issues lifted the Nasdaq composite index
3.75 to 793.03.
The day's economic news was mixed. On a favourable note, December housing
starts climbed 6.2 per cent to an annualised rate of 1.54m units, well ahead
of expectations. That development was partially offset by a rise in weekly
claims for unemployment benefit.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's January index of business activity
slipped to 34.2, from last month's lofty 42.9 level. But the net impact of
the moderating growth trend was positive for stocks, which drew comfort from
the decline in bond yields on the heels of the survey's release.
With the expectations of investors inflated by weeks of strong economic
news, several companies retreated even though their results matched or
exceeded forecasts. The trend was exemplified by Computer Associates, which
posted earnings of 72 cents a share, against forecasts of 67 cents, but the
stock fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 .
Transportation issues were generally weaker. Union Pacific was marked down
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 63 7/8 after posting a 22 per cent increase in net
income. CSX shed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 86 1/2 on a flat profits
performance.
Among defence and aerospace concerns, General Electric slipped Dollars 3/8
to Dollars 108 3/8 in spite of fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 1.73 a
share, against Dollars 1.57 a year earlier. Loral's 28 per cent advance
generated little excitement: the stock edged Dollars  1/2 lower to Dollars
37 1/2 .
Investors shrugged off a strong earnings report from Monsanto, down Dollars
1 7/8 at Dollars 78 1/8
Amid weakness in other banking stocks, Bankers Trust added Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 79 1/8 on reporting record earnings before accounting charges, and
announcing plans to buy back 1m to 2m shares in the current quarter.
Canada
Toronto declined in heavy trading, ending a winning streak that saw the TSE
300 index set record-high closes in each of the previous six sessions. The
index ended 20.5 off at 4,542.4 and falls led rises by 452 to 356 after
volume of 87.5m shares. Golds lost 3 per cent.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Domestic investors drive markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in the leading European equity markets accelerated in December as
share prices were driven higher by investors hoping for lower interest rates
in the new year. Trading volume rose 12.2 per cent after increases of 2.9
per cent in November and 10.1 per cent in October.
The strong December rise accompanied an 8.2 per cent gain in the FT-A Europe
index as all eight markets rallied on hopes of a further cut in German
interest rates.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities comments that it was a fitting end to
a year in which turnover in the markets rose by 40.3 per cent over 1992 as
the FT-A Europe index rose 32.2 per cent. Excluding the UK, turnover was up
by 50.3 per cent and the index put on 39.9 per cent.
However, turnover in European stocks traded during December on Seaq
International, the London screen-based system, fell by 2 per cent on the
month.
'This contrast to strong volume growth in domestic markets suggests that the
strength of equities is increasingly being driven less by international
buying and more by the flow of funds from domestic investors drawing down
bank accounts and money market funds as interest rates fall,' says Mr
Cornish.
During December, international institutional investors were still heavily
committed to the south east Asian region, where huge rises were seen during
the final quarter of last year after US and Japanese banks and brokers
pointed to their potential.
Events during December could point to volatility in the European markets in
the months ahead. 'Continuing heavy flows of domestic money into the markets
as interest rates come down further could make foreign investors even more
reluctant to return as valuations climb,' says Mr Cornish. 'The result could
be a broad correction, perhaps during the summer, as private investors,
unnerved by markets that are not rising any further, decide to pull their
money out.'
Germany recorded the month's biggest gain, with turnover up 18.6 per cent to
levels surpassing the previous record set in March 1990, although that peak
immediately preceded a sharp correction after the unification euphoria. The
market was buoyed during last month by a stream of corporate news and
results which took the Dax index to a series of record highs. Speculation,
in the event ill-founded, about rate cuts ahead of the month's Bundesbank
council meetings, also played a part.
Italian turnover surged 17.9 per cent on the month, representing a 12.3 per
cent rise over the average for the previous three months, as investors
recovered their confidence after the surprise rout of centre parties in
November's local elections. The pick-up also accompanied signs that the
budget was winning a broad measure of support in parliament and strong
demand for privatisation candidates.
In the Netherlands, turnover fell 6.6 per cent, although this was still 7
per cent higher than the average for the previous three months.
Spain's 7.3 per cent decline came as little surprise after November's record
level, and turnover was still 20.8 per cent higher than the average of the
previous three months.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei continues to rise
as Bangkok retreats 4.2%

Receding uncertainty over the passage of the political reform bill through
the upper house encouraged investors, and share prices gained ground in
active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 144.52 up at 19,183.92 after a day's low of
19,025.70 and high of 19,341.73. The Topix index of all first section stocks
added 9.64 at 1,550.79 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.40
higher at 1,283.99.
Although the Nikkei index temporarily lost momentum in the morning, the
upper house committee vote supported sentiment. Yesterday's approval by the
committee set the bill up for a vote in the upper house, indicating that the
government is one step closer to moving on to making economic decisions.
European investors bought actively during the morning session, triggering
small-lot buying by domestic investors. 'Buying by foreigners was probably
this year's most active,' said an analyst. Traders said some funds were
flowing into the stock market from the sluggish bond market.
Afternoon sales by Japanese dealers were countered by overseas demand.
'Japanese investors are cautiously choosing individual stocks,' said Mr
Yutaka Nakai at Daiwa Securities. He said corporate selling ahead of the
March book closing would remain small while share prices were advancing.
Volume amounted to 550m shares, rising above the 500m level for the first
time since December 10. Advances led declines by 537 to 486, with 164 issues
unchanged.
Banking shares were bought by overseas investors underweight in the sector.
Sumitomo Bank rose Y70 to Y2,170 and Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y100 at
Y3,070.
Other financial stocks were also strong, with Nikko Securities up Y20 to
Y1,220 and Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance adding Y30 at Y1,260.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, rising Y11,000 to Y855,000, posted its 16th
consecutive gain, while foreign investors supported East Japan Railway,
which moved up Y8,000 to Y491,000.
Nippon Kayaku jumped Y68 to Y812 and Takara Shuzo rose Y50 to Y790 on
speculation that the companies' immunosuppressant drug will be marketed in
Europe.
Hanwa, the steel trader whose stock was suspended on Wednesday after an
announcement of the resignation of its president and large investment
losses, was left untraded due to a lack of buyers. The stock remained
offered at Y677, down by its daily limit of Y100.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 89.54 to 21,003.56 in volume of 68m shares.
Roundup
Many of the region's markets fell back yesterday.
BANGKOK dropped by 4.21 per cent as institutions sold finance and property
shares. The SET index lost 61.44 to 1,398.3 in turnover of BT13.4bn.
Sentiment was affected by worries about tighter liquidity following the rise
in the overnight interbank rate. Finance and property were the two big
sector losers, the former losing 6.6 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.
HONG KONG eased back as investors booked profits. The Hang Seng index fell
98.93 to 11,264.84, after a high of 11,637.41.

active stance on both the buy and sell sides.

2.50 to HKDollars 65.50, and Henderson HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 51.
PAKISTAN fell sharply ahead of today's weekend, as investors in the
financial sector led sellers, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The KSE-100 index fell 51.68 at 2,399.49.
Falls were led by the financial sector as investors sold shares in banks and
other financial institutions, fearing that the continued rise in prices had
made such stocks overvalued, analysts said.
SEOUL drifted lower as the consolidation phase continued. The composite
index ended 8.8 lower at 878.29.
Honam Petrochemical and Hanyang Chemical went limit up, gaining Won400 each
to Won9,220 and Won8,140 respectively. Honam and Hanyang have been chosen as

on Wall Street.
The composite index added 50.65 to 3,112.93 in turnover of 2.1bn pesos.

by the futures market and blue chips.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): LVMH depressed in Paris after
announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual stories predominated in yesterday's trading, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS was preoccupied with LVMH after the group announced that it was to
rejig its cross shareholding structure with Guinness of the UK. Under terms
of the announcement the UK group will sell its 24 per cent indirect stake in
LVMH and take a 34 per cent direct stake in Moet Hennessy. The group also
said that it expects the changes to give it a cash pile of some FFr11bn.
LVMH closed down FFr138 or 3.4 per cent at FFr3,899, after a low of
FFr3,635; and those of associated groups Bon Marche and Christian Dior lost
FFr47 and FFr30 respectively to FFr735 and FFr360.
The CAC-40 index shed 16.86 to 2,257.81 in turnover of some FFr5.3bn.
FRANKFURT closed lower in directionless trading although traders were not
surprised by the Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
The DAX index fell 18.18 to 2,116.20.
Turnover was DM9bn and in the post-bourse the Ibis indicated index lost a
further 34.2 to 2,098.36.
Metallgesellschaft, fell DM7 or 3 per cent to DM237.50 and after the
official close announced that it would, in the medium term, become a
management holding company with three operating divisions: trading,
chemicals and plant construction.
Elsewhere, activity was generally muted although Continental managed to go
against the trend, adding DM2 to 262.
AMSTERDAM retreated moderately as the large multinational groups were
affected by a slightly weaker dollar. The AEX index slipped 2.35 to 424.98.
DSM retreated Fl 1.60 to Fl 109.10 on further investor worries about its
positioning in the petrochemicals sector, while Akzo was off Fl 2.90 at Fl
207.00.
Fokker went slightly against the trend, up 90 cents at Fl 21.20, but off a
high of Fl 21.80, as it announced that it had won an order to supply
aircraft to the UK.
ZURICH finished mixed after a volatile day. The SMI index fell 3.5 to
3,045.9. with today's expiry of the Soffex SMI index future producing some
uncertainty.
Nestle eased on sustained profit taking ahead of its announcement of sales
figures for 1993. However, the shares picked up from a low of SFr1,316 to
finish SFr10 easier on the day at SFr1,332 with the 5.4 per cent rise in
sales proving at the upper end of expectations.
Registered shares in Sandoz erased earlier losses to finish SFr30 to
SFr4,180 on its announcement of a 4.7 per cent rise in sales during 1993.
MILAN continued steady, the Comit index adding 0.36 to 617.71, although some
heavy selling was seen late in the day.
The insurers were marked down amid speculation that a decree which would see
the sector reimbursed for some of their contributions to the state insurer,
Ina, ahead of its privatisation, could be delayed because of the forthcoming
election. Generali fell L769 to L38,090 and SAI was L573 lower at L17,564.
Montedison edged L4 higher to L956. Continuing heavy volume of trading at
86.4m shares prompted speculation that the creditor banks might be shifting
their holdings.
MADRID pulled back after Wednesday's record close as profit-takers emerged.
The general index shed 1.61 to 341.62.
Banking stocks were hit hardest. Banco Central Hispano shed Pta75 to
Pta3,205 and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya eased Pta50 to Pta3,045.
Endesa remained firm, finishing Pta80 ahead at Pta7.940 after peaking at a
record Pta8,100.
WARSAW climbed to a new high but market analysts commented that they
expected a correction ahead of the listing of Bank Slaski on Tuesday.
The index rose 339.2 or 2.2 per cent to 15,420.8 in turnover of 3,400bn
zlotys.
ISTANBUL rose 5.7 per cent after falling for more than four sessions, as the
currency stabilised against the dollar following recent volatility.
The composite index ended up 1,520.28 at 27,024.86.
ATHENS continued its correction for the second consecutive session with a
fall in the general index of more than 3 per cent. The index ended at
1,132.11 in high volume of 4.7m shares.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Markets Report: German moves confuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of unexpected and oddly timed announcements from the Bundesbank
left the foreign exchange markets bemused and somewhat wrong-footed on a day
described by one analyst as remarkable, writes Emma Tucker.
An early announcement from the German central bank that it had decided to
leave its official discount and Lombard rates unchanged was widely expected
and made little impact on the D-Mark.
However, the Bundesbank did not make any comment on the repo rate, prompting
speculation that next week it would ease monetary conditions either via a
lower fixed repo rate or by reintroducing a variable rate.
Euromark futures traded up on the news, but dropped when half-an-hour later
the Bundesbank - in what looked like an afterthought - announced it would
set the next two securities repo tenders at a fixed 6 per cent.
Further confusing matters, the Bundesbank declared in the afternoon that it
intended to reduce and restructure its minimum reserve requirements in a
move to improve the competitiveness of Germany's banks.
The Bundesbank said it was scrapping the progressive rate on minimum reserve
requirements on sight deposits and introducing a flat rate of 5 per cent,
effective March 1. Previously, minimum reserve requirements of between 6.6
per cent and 12.1 per cent had been imposed according to the volume on
deposit. It added that any rise in liquidity that resulted from the change
in reserve requirements would be dealt with through its money market
operations.
Economists said the move was also designed to reduce credit costs in the
economy without putting the D-Mark under any undue pressure.
Sure enough, the net effect of the Bundesbank's various moves was to boost
the D-Mark against the dollar.
'The fact that the reserves changes could be good for German banks, and
potentially good for the economy, and the fact that the repo rate was held
at 6 per cent, means that the result of the day's moves was beneficial for
the D-Mark,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America.
The dollar shot up  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, after the announced
changes to the reserve requirements, but dropped back once the Bundesbank
made it clear that it would mop up extra liquidity resulting from the move,
through its regular money market operations. The dollar closed at DM1.7358,
down from the previous day's DM1.744, as strong housing starts data failed
to deliver a decisive boost to the currency. In New York it ended at
DM1.7376.
The Bank of England sent a clear signal to the UK money markets yesterday
that it was unhappy with recent speculation of a cut in interest rates.
It attempted to quash further speculation, by not offering an early round of
assistance in spite of a relatively large shortage of Pounds 1.2bn.
As a result of this unexpected behaviour - the market virtually takes for
granted an early round when the shortage is higher than Pounds 1bn - the
overnight rate shot up to 5 1/2 per cent, from 4 3/8 per cent at 9.15am. The
overnight rate ended at 6 per cent, reflecting a lack of liquidity in a very
thin market.
But the three-month interbank rate - a rough indication of where the markets
believe base lending rates will be in the spring - remained steady. Having
opened at 5 9/32 per cent, it moved up  1/16 percentage point to end at 5
11/32 per cent.
'It is a slap on the wrist,' commented one dealer. 'The Bank is saying do
not be stupid boys. Rates are where we set them, not where you want them,
and they are staying where they are at the moment.' Another said: 'My guess
is the Bank does not like where three-month money is at the moment, they
think it is too low.'
The March short sterling contract traded in a wide range, reflecting the
Bank's operations. From an opening of 94.82 it dropped as low as 94.72
before closing at 94.75.
In early trading the pound was buoyant, following a radio interview in the
morning during which Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, sought to calm
expectations for another interest rate cut.
'What you have to do is set yourself a clear idea of when you change
interest rates and stick to it, not be influenced by what the papers say in
the morning,' said Mr Clarke. He added that in the medium term the
government needed to keep inflation down, because for the businesses now
enjoying the recovery, 'most of them know that inflation could be a serious
check to that recovery'.
The pound did not sustain its lift, however, mainly because of D-Mark gains,
and closed just slightly up at DM2.6029 from Wednesday's DM2.6016. Against
the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4996, up from Dollars 1.4918.
The Swedish crown was weaker after a  1/4 point cut in Sweden's marginal
interest rate to 7.5 per cent. Analysts said the cut confirmed the central
bank's cautious approach to monetary policy and its desire to see a
sustained strengthening of the crown.
Turkey's central bank hoisted interest rates sharply to halt a run on the
lira, but banks remained reluctant to lend more to the Treasury.
The lira ended at 17,000 to the dollar on the interbank market after
slumping 12.1 per cent on Wednesday to 18,500, after the central bank raised
weekly interest rates to 135 per cent from 105 per cent.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium prices slide as
producer talks drag on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium prices fell back sharply at the London Metal Exchange yesterday as
traders became increasingly nervous about the outcome of the Brussels
meeting at which leading producing countries were seeking a multilateral
solution to the supply glut that recently drove prices to all-time lows in
real terms.
In the morning some delegates had appeared hopeful as they entered on an
unscheduled third day of negotiations. 'We are moving towards an agreement.
. . hopefully today,' an Australian official told the Reuter news agency.
And Mr Georgy Gabunia, leader of the Russian delegation, claimed that his
team was adopting 'a very positive approach'.
A flood of Russian material on to the world market following the collapse of
the Soviet Union has been widely blamed for the present oversupply and there
were indications on Wednesday that agreement had eluded delegates during the
first two days of talks because of Russia's determination not to shift from
its opening offer.
The early bullishness of the delegates was reflected at the LME, where the
aluminium price for delivery in three months rose to Dollars 1,214 a tonne
from Wednesday's close of Dollars 1,205.50.
But the mood seemed to have have changed as delegates emerged for the midday
recess. Mr Gabunia was putting a brave face on things. 'We are still
talking,' he told Reuter, 'so we still hope to get an agreement.' But a
western diplomat reported that little progress had been made. 'Most of the
talking seems to have been between the US and the Russians,' he added.
That apparent erosion of earlier confidence sapped the spirit of the market,
and as an agreed news blackout ruled out further progress reports there was
nothing to halt the ensuing price decline. As the talks dragged on into the
evening the LME three months price closed at Dollars 1,186.75 a tonne,
having touched Dollars 1,180 at one point.
Trade delegates were still struggling late last night to thrash out an
agreement that would take enough aluminium capacity out of operation to give
fresh heart to the market. Analysts believe cuts amounting to at least 1.5m
tonnes a year, or about 10 per cents of current ouput, would be needed to
achieve this.
Daily average primary aluminium output in December 1993 was down to 40,500
tonnes from 40,700 in November and 41,900 in December 1992, provisional
figures from the International Primary Aluminium Institute show.
Total production in December (31 days) was 1.256m tonnes, compared with
1.22m in November (30 days) and 1.3m in December 1992.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER prices bounced yesterday, moving past the technical target of 530 US
cents an ounce for spot metal. But the market floundered as it approached
its recent highs above 540 cents and closed at 532.50 cents a lb, up 7 cents
on the day.
At the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), however, the March futures price
sustained an early fall to 522 cents an ounce before rallying in late
trading to 528 cents, down 6.7 cents on the day. The New York silver market
has been very volatile of late, with the March position registering a
23-cent swing on Wednesday. 'Silver is fairly thin on Comex and just a few
people can move the market,' a London dealer explained.
The London GOLD price moved up cautiously early on but with physical
interest scarce the gain was pared back to 90 cents at Dollars 392.30 an
ounce.
'It is swamped by the paper side. Physical demand may indicate support areas
but it cannot give the market a significant push,' one dealer said.
At the London Commodity Exchange the COCOA futures market steadied in the
afternoon after sustaining sharp losses before lunch. The May quotation
closed Pounds 15 down at Pounds 908 a tonne after reaching Pounds 899 at one
time.
Traders read little into the move, saying the market was still holding its
recent wide range. 'Until we break Pounds 900 or Pounds 948, then it's not a
break into new territory,' one commented.
London Metal Exchange contracts were generally lower, the exception being
LEAD, which saw the three months position reach Dollars 524 a tonne before
running into resistance. At the close it was quoted at Dollars 520.75 a
tonne, up Dollars 10.25 on the day.
ZINC ended easier but underlying support towards Dollars 1,020 a tonne
stemmed the fall.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN's aid agency for small
farmers faces funding crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nation's small farmer agency, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, is facing a financial crisis because the countries
that provide funds have been unable to agree over replenishing its kitty.
Delegates from over 140 countries are to meet in Rome from January 26 to 28
for a crucial meeting of Ifad's governing council that could decide to look
for alternative means of financing.
The Rome-based agency, set up in 1977, is jointly funded by western
countries and members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
It makes interest-free loans to poorer farmers that are often missed by
other agencies. In 1993, it committed USDollars 268m to projects in 33
countries.
But funds have been shrinking after years of disputes between donors. In its
early years, Ifad was receiving about Dollars 1,000m for its three-year work
cycles and donors have agreed that it should receive Dollars 600m for its
next three years' work.
Last October, however, Saudi Arabia, the biggest Opec contributor, announced
that it would give only Dollars 3m, instead of the Dollars 30m it gave for
the present cycle. The Saudis want Ifad to be funded in a different way.
The agency's president, Mr Fawzi Al-Sultan, of Kuwait, will propose at next
week's meeting that a committee be set up to look at alternative ways of
raising money. But this could take a year to report.
While other countries could make up the Saudi Arabian shortfall, donors such
as Britain and Canada have cut their aid to developing countries. But the
Netherlands and Scandinavian countries might be prepared to pay more. 'The
fund is very highly regarded and this could help to save it,' said an
official of a European donor country.
Ifad earns about Dollars 150m a year from its own investments and loans and
has enough money for its work this year. But unless donors agree to
replenish the fund, it may not be viable and will have to cut back or even
close in 1995.
African countries would be the hardest hit if Ifad cut back or closed. About
two-fifths of its loans have gone to Africa.

The Board of Governors of New York's metals exchange, the Comex, gave the
nod to a merger with its neighbour the New York Mercantile Exchange at a
meeting Wednesday night.
Comex board approval is expected to set off an active lobbying effort to
persuade members of both exchanges to vote for the merger.
Nymex and Comex members will receive a proxy statement detailing the merger
proposal within four or five weeks, with a vote to be scheduled shortly
afterward. A two-thirds majority of the Comex members voting and a majority
of Nymex members voting is required to approve the merger.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian move lifts coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices staged a partial recovery after Wednesday's sharp fall and
moved up Dollars 11 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 1,180 a tonne.
The market was buoyed by Brazil's announcement that it would rollover
producers' debt, for which it is holding coffee as collateral. That means
Brasilia will be able to hold on to the coffee rather than selling it in the
open market. In fact, Brazil will enter the market again today when it
stages its latest coffee auction.
Reports that the uprising in Mexico could affect the coffee crop also
underpinned prices. Some estimates have put the loss to national production
from rebel action as high as 20 per cent.
Colombia's decision to cut its export target by 1m bags to 11m bags because
the harvest was turning out to be poorer than expected had already given
support to the weak coffee market.
Coffee producers will meet in Guatemala today to review the retention scheme
which came into operation in October. Although coffee prices have not risen
much since the scheme came into operation, producers' actions have helped to
support prices at their current level.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main wool markets moved more strongly ahead this week. Extra fine merino
fleece was in particularly strong demand at Geelong, and prices moved up
quite sharply in this speciality sector. Other merinos were dearer, in South
Africa as well as Australia. The increases were enhanced, directly or
indirectly, by recent marked appreciation of the Australian dollar against
the US dollar and thus against European and Far Eastern currencies on which
the leading wool consuming countries base their costs. There has been
limited support from buyers further down the line but confidence is better.
The special British wool situation, with isolated buyers oversold and forced
into urgent covering, which led to inflated prices at sales just before
Christmas appeared to become less important as prices eased a little at this
week's Bradford auction.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Placer Dome outbids Newmont for
big Peruvian gold deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Placer Dome, of Canada, through its newly-established Peruvian subsidiary,
snapped up the option on a Peruvian gold deposit owned by state mining
company Mineroperu at auction in Lima yesterday. It is Placer Dome's first
Peruvian acquisition.
Placer Dome offered a total of USDollars 7.1m over five years for the rights
to the 3,500-hectare deposit known as Jehuamarca, in the northern department
of Lambayeque. It will also commit Dollars 2.45m to development of the
deposit.
The Canadian company, which is looking at a number of investment
possibilities in Peru, outbid Newmont Mining, of the US, joint owner and
operator of the recently-opened and hugely-profitable Yanacocha gold deposit
in the department of Cajamarca. Newmont offered Dollars 3m and Anaconda, of
Chile, in association with a Peruvian company, Dollars 1.8m.
Local representatives of Placer Dome described their offer as a 'blow-out
bid'. 'Geologically, it looks very attractive,' said Mr Jose Antonio
Olaechea, legal representative.
Jehuamarca was discovered in 1970 and has been partially explored with
assistance from Japanese mining engineers. Initial tests indicate the ore
contains around one gramme of gold per tonne, between 160 and 480 grammes
per tonne of silver and up to nine per cent zinc. Placer will have three
years to complete further studies before a definitive contract is signed.
Next on the Mineroperu sell-off calendar is its modern copper refinery
located in the southern port of Ilo. The sale date is February 2 and five
potential purchasers have been pre-qualified to bid - Southern Peru Copper
Corporation and Cyprus Minerals, both from the US; Mitsui and Marubeni, of
Japan; and Britain's Montagu Mining and Finance.
The Ilo refinery is up to date and relatively efficient. It presently exists
solely to produce 99.99 pure copper cathodes from SPCC's blister under a
tolling agreement. This requires SPCC to pay Dollars 300 a tonne, refined,
considerably above the international norm, hence the US-owned company's
interest in acquiring the refinery for itself.
The minimum price for Ilo has been set at Dollars 75m with an additional
investment commitment of Dollars 20m over three years.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ireland's meat exports grow by
20 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Irish livestock and meat exports grew by 20 per cent in 1993 to IPounds
1.6bn, reflecting a 75 per cent drop in sales into intervention and the
growing success of Irish meat processors in penetrating retail markets in
the UK and Europe.
According to CBF, the Irish livestock and meat board, beef export volume
grew by 50 per cent to 400,000 tonnes. Of this 160,000 tonnes was sold to
the UK, while a further 120,000 tonnes went to other European Union outlets.
Lamb and pigmeat sales were also buoyant, up 10 per cent and 11 per cent
respectively, but CBF also warns of tightening profit margins compounded by
an expected increase in red-meat production throughout the EU in 1994.
That warning was reinforced this week by Mr Denis Brosnan, the chief
executive of Kerry Group, one of Ireland's leading food processors, who said
that operating margins in red-meat production were down to only 2 per cent
and that 'it would not be inconceivable' that Kerry might pull out of the
sector in the next three to four years if market conditions did not improve.
One of the problems for the beef processors is that much of the increase in
cattle output has been accounted for by live exports, while throughput at
meat export plants has declined by 6 per cent 'to its lowest level since
1990', according to CBF.
The Irish cattle herd now stands at 7m head, its highest since 1979. The
national sheep flock has declined by 3 per cent to 8.7m, the first drop in a
decade, while the pig herd has continued to grow to a record level of 1.5m
head.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Bonds: EIB dominates activity on quiet day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 10-year sterling bond for the European Investment Bank, two Swedish krone
issues and a continued stream of structured floating-rate note deals
dominated a quieter day in the Eurobond market.
The EIB issued Pounds 400m of 6 per cent bonds due November 2004, priced to
yield the same as the 6 3/4 per cent gilt due 2004. While the pricing was
the tightest of recent EIB sterling issues, the deal met good demand from
overseas investors, especially in eastern Asia, said a syndicate official
with lead manager Samuel Montagu.
'It is tightly priced if you look at it in isolation, but when you consider
that our 6 per cent bonds due 1999 were launched at one basis point over
gilts and have traded as much as five basis points through gilts, it looks
fair,' said an official at the Luxembourg-based bank.
Given that half a dozen banks had bid aggressively for the mandate at a
yield spread of between zero and two basis points over gilts, 'we felt
comfortable that there would be sufficient demand to drive the issue,' he
added.
Much of the overseas demand for the bonds was attributed to the fact that
they are easier for foreigners to trade than gilts.
In the Eurodollar sector, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior
(Bancomext) launched Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds, the first Mexican global
bond to be issued.
Joint lead managers Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs indicated a spread of
160-165 basis points over Treasuries, the tightest for any Latin American
issuer to date.
The issue will be priced today.
Yield-hungry investors were able to stock up on fresh supply in the
Scandinavian sector, where two more Swedish krone issues were launched
following offerings earlier this week from Swedish Export Credit and GECC.
The French financing agency Credit Foncier de France issued SKr1.5bn of
five-year bonds, priced at a spread of 20 basis points over the
corresponding Swedish government bond, via Swiss Bank Corporation. Spintab,
the Swedish mortgage lender, issued another SKr1bn of five-year bonds at 64
basis points over the benchmark, reflecting its lower rating. The lead
manager was Morgan Stanley.
'The two issues were at opposite ends of the credit spectrum, so there
wasn't too much overlap,' said one trader. The Nordic Investment Bank is set
to issue SKr1.5bn of global five-year bonds soon via Merrill Lynch.
Swedish bonds' substantial yield pick-up over core European markets and
hopes for further currency appreciation amid continued rate cuts - the
Swedish central bank yesterday lowered its marginal rate by  1/4 point - are
spurring investor demand for Swedish bonds, traders said.
The Kingdom of Sweden issued Es10bn of five-year bonds via Banco Portugues
de Investimento. Sweden is the second sovereign to have tapped the escudo
sector after Ireland's Es15bn issue last October. The proceeds of the issue
were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks, according to the lead manager.
Another raft of so-called corridor floating-rate notes with maturities of
one and two years was issued yesterday, including borrowers such as General
Electric Credit Corporation, Morgan Stanley Trust Company, Credit Suisse
Finance, Swedish Export Credit and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
The province of Ontario is planning to launch its third global Canadian
dollar bond issue and its first global US dollar floating-rate note in the
near future, Reuter reports. The transactions will cover Ontario's remaining
CDollars 600m public borrowing requirements for the year ending March and
provide pre-funding for 1994-95. The Canadian dollar global transaction will
be jointly led by Goldman Sachs, Nesbitt Thomson, ScotiaMcLeod and Daiwa
Securities. The US dollar FRN will be jointly led by Lehman Brothers and
Merrill Lynch.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Europeans disappointed as Bundesbank
leaves rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank left its discount and Lombard interest rates unchanged at
yesterday's council meeting, disappointing Europe's government bond markets,
most of which ended lower on the day.
However, Sweden's Riksbank announced a long-awaited quarter-point reduction
in its marginal rate, to 7.50 per cent from 7.75 per cent, prompting some
profit-taking in the government bond market.
The reduction followed the release of favourable inflation figures - the
consumer prices index dropped to an annual rate of 4.1 per cent in December
from 4.9 per cent in November - and was aided by the strength of the krone.
Three-year yields climbed 17 basis points to 6.39 per cent while nine-year
yields rose 6 basis points to 6.80 per cent.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged - with the
discount rate at 5.75 per cent and the Lombard at 6.75 per cent - pushed
prices down by about a quarter of a point.
'In theory (the cut) should have been good news for the long end of the bund
market, as it shows the Bundesbank is firm about inflation, but that wasn't
the actual effect,' said Mr Ifty Islam, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch.
While the news on interest rates proved disappointing, reports that the
central bank plans to reduce its reserve requirements caused a flurry of
excitement in the market.
The proposed changes, which take effect from March 1, were at first seen as
likely to increase liquidity. However, the Bundesbank added it would
compensate for the liquidity effects of the reserve reduction by a reduction
in the amount of money available through securities repurchase agreements -
a qualification which dampened the bund market's enthusiasm.
Hopes of an imminent cut in UK interest rates received a further setback,
causing the UK government bond market to lose its recent momentum and
short-dated gilts to close lower on the day.
The market opened on a firm note, continuing the previous day's strong rally
in response to the latest retail sales and inflation figures.
However, expectations of a rate cut were dampened by comments from the
chancellor of the exchequer and moves by the Bank of England yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the recovery in the UK economy was
strong enough to withstand the tax rises which will take effect in April. He
stressed the importance of preserving a steady recovery and keeping
inflation down.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England sent a clear signal aimed at calming rate cut
speculation in its money market operations. Short-dated gilts slipped on the
news, but long-dated gilts remained firm on the good inflation background.
Japanese government bonds rallied in the wake of recent losses, but the main
gains were made by the benchmark 10-year No. 157 bond, rather than in the
other maturities, according to dealers.
The rally was sparked by rumours that the Bank of Japan would conduct its
regular bond buy-back operations more frequently, dealers said.
US Treasuries gained ground across the maturity range yesterday after the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that economic activity in the region
was moderating.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 higher at
99 25/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.261 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/8 ahead at 100 3/8 , to yield 4.029 per cent.
Before the advance, the market weathered a short-lived bout of selling after
the announcement that US housing starts had climbed 6.2 per cent last month,
to an annualised rate of 1.54m units, well ahead of a consensus forecast of
1.42m.
However, jitters over the pace of economic expansion were quelled later in
the morning when the Philadelphia Fed reported that its January index of
business activity had fallen to 34.2, compared with 42.4 the previous month.
After December's spurt, the market welcomed the suggestion that the economy
was now growing at a rate that was less likely to trigger higher inflation
and undermine the value of fixed-rate securities.
Traders also decided that the Los Angeles earthquake and the severe cold
snap gripping the east and mid-west of the country would put a further drag
on the economy.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Equities: Dollars 100m issue from Indian
transport company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Eastern Shipping, the Indian transport group, has raised Dollars 100m
through a fully underwritten equity issue.
Jardine Fleming and James Capel (part of the HSBC Investment Banking group),
joint lead managers, bought the issue and then placed the shares with
international investors.
The steady stream of Indian equity issues is expected to continue,
investment bankers said, with several names already lined up tap the
international capital markets.
Earlier this week, Indo Gulf Fertilisers and Chemicals, a private sector
company, raised Dollars 100m with its offering of global depositary
receipts. The GDRs were priced at Dollars 4.51 on Monday and traded at
Dollars 5.50-Dollars 6.00 yesterday according to BZW, the lead manager.
Investment bankers point out that recent Indian issues have frequently
attracted Dollars 1.5bn in demand in the book-building process, reflecting
strong investor appetite.
Kleinwort Benson is currently holding roadshows for Indian Rayon, a rayon,
cement and carbon black producer, which is hoping to raise about Dollars
125m with its GDR offering.
Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the state-controlled international telecommunications
network, is expected to launch a large international equity offering this
spring. Investment bankers expect the offering to raise more than Dollars
500m. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson are global co-ordinators.

restriction removed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina has removed one of the key obstacles to restructuring the finances
of Aerolneas Argentinas, the loss-making privatised airline. It is allowing
foreign investors to hold a majority of the company without altering its
flag-carrier status.
The government issued a decree stipulating simply that investors in
Aerolneas should be legally domiciled in Argentina. Previously, legislation
stated that Argentine nationals must hold at least 51 per cent of the
company. An Aerolneas executive said: 'With these new rules, the financial
problems are resolved.'
Iberia, the Spanish national airline which operates and owns 30 per cent of
Aerolneas, said this week it would go ahead with a Dollars 500m capital
injection for the company. However, its efforts to raise the equity would
have been hindered by the rule that 51 per cent of Aerolneas should be held
by nationals.
The Argentine government, which owns 33 per cent of the airline as well as
10 per cent held in trust for employees, said it would not contribute any
money.
An Argentine bank and two small investors hold a further 8 per cent of
Aerolneas, but only the Medefin merchant bank said it would participate in
the capital-raising exercise.
As well as contributing its Dollars 150m share, Iberia is expected to be
supported by Spain's Banco Hispano and the troubled Banesto, which each hold
7.5 per cent of Aerolneas. It could also buy 28 per cent of the company from
the government, which bought the stake in 1992 to prevent the collapse of
the airline.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard adds credibility
to Taligent / A look at computing's latest alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decision by Hewlett-Packard to take a 15 per cent stake in
Taligent, a joint venture between International Business Machines and Apple
Computer, sent a frisson of anticipation through the computer industry.
HP, now the most profitable computer manufacturer in the US, intends to use
Taligent's technology to develop and extend its principal computer operating
software. It will also make available to Taligent its own software for
company-wide computer networks.
Partnerships and strategic alliances are increasingly common among computer
manufacturers but HP's involvement in Taligent gives a new credibility to a
partnership seen as much as a move to counter Microsoft's domination of
computer operating systems as an attempt to push back the frontiers of
computing.
Taligent's stated objective, however, is to change the way companies process
data by introducing advanced operating software better suited to running
networks of high powered workstations and personal computers than today's
limited and unfriendly systems.
Taligent technology should make it easier for companies to develop software
quickly to meet new requirements.
Mr Jean Claude Malraison of IBM Europe says: 'The whole software landscape
is going to change as a result of this new approach.' Experts agree, with
reservations.
Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy, says: 'Taligent has the
monumental, albeit risky, opportunity to re-define the nature of computer
operating systems.'
Operating systems - software which controls and manages the internal
workings of computers - are complex and the choices open to customers are
frequently confusing.
Microsoft is the leading supplier of operating systems for individual PCs;
of the world's 100m PCs most run on MS/DOS and Windows. The Apple Macintosh,
with its own unique operating software, accounts for other 8.5m computer
users.
Microsoft has developed an operating system suitable for linking PCs and
workstations in company-wide networks - Windows NT - but it is at an early
stage in its acceptance.
Taligent is targeting this market for enterprise-wide computing. Its
operating system is derived from a version of Apple software, code-named
'Pink', and uses an advanced technology called 'object orientation', in
which software is written in self-contained, re-usable, modules.
IBM's reasons for involvement in Taligent are clear. It allowed Microsoft to
take control of the PC operating system market in the 1980s and its own
large-scale operating system, OS/2, has not been an immediate success. It is
struggling to return to profitability after several years of losses and
wants greater influence in the direction of the industry.
Apple's involvement is also strategic. While still the second largest
manufacturer of personal computers, it is at a crossroads. Its operating
software, though well regarded, has been eclipsed by the marketing power of
Microsoft. There are 30,000 applications programs running on MS/DOS and
Windows and only 7,000 for the Apple Macintosh. Apple's survival is in
question unless it can exploit new trends.
The relief in Apple president Mr Michael Spindler's voice is almost palpable
when he says: 'With the commitment and support of industry leaders like HP,
IBM and Apple, Taligent is now poised to provide the volume object platform
for enterprise computing.'
But why should HP, the undoubted US electronics star of the 1990s, with
annual revenues in excess of Dollars 20bn, wish to ally itself with these
stumbling giants?
Because it aims to be the world leader in electronics hardware manufacture
rather than software: 'HP will never be a leader in operating systems,' says
Mr John Golding, managing director of HP's UK offshoot, which is responsible
for about a third of its research and development. 'We want to be the
hardware manufacturer of choice.'
The first Taligent products should emerge from the laboratory this year.
Unlike earlier operating systems which have been offered as complete
products, Taligent will release a series of 'frameworks' or sub-systems.
A complete set of frameworks will be equivalent to a complete operating
system.
These frameworks will be incorporated in the partners existing operating
systems - IBM's OS/2 and AIX, Apple's system and HP's HP-UX this year; IBM's
OS/400 and MVS next year. These systems cover the range of personal
computers, mid-range machines and mainframes. The aim is to make the change
for customers as painless as possible.
Microsoft, meanwhile, has its own developments under way. 'Chicago', the
code name for an improved version of Windows, was announced recently.
'Cairo', Microsoft's own object oriented version of Windows NT should make
its appearance later.
By next year it should be clear whether HP has put its money on the right
operating systems horse.

Apple Computer yesterday reported a 75 per cent drop in first-quarter net
income as industry-wide price cutting in the personal computer market
depressed its gross margins.
Net income totalled Dollars 40m, or 34 cents a share, down from Dollars
161.3m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, in the same period of last year.
Revenues, however, rose by 23 per cent to Dollars 2.47bn and unit shipments
of Macintosh personal computers rose 40 per cent, passing the 1m mark for
the first time in the company's history.
The earnings figures, announced after the markets closed, were a little
better than some analysts' forecasts.
Gross margins for the company were 24 per cent of net sales, compared to
40.5 per cent in the same period of last year and about 26 per cent in the
previous quarter.
To compensate for lower margins, the company began a major restructuring
last July. It said yesterday that this helped it cut operating expenses in
the latest quarter to 21.4 per cent of net sales, from 28.5 per cent a year
ago.
Mr Michael Spindler, president, said: 'Our challenge is to continue to grow
our unit shipments and revenues while we make further progress in reducing
our operating expenses.'
He said first-quarter revenue growth came in markets which were important to
the future of the PC industry. In the US, shipments through consumer
channels more than doubled compared with a year earlier. Internationally,
shipments in Japan grew by more than 100 per cent.
In the portable computer market, shipments of Apple PowerBooks were up
strongly, with nearly 200,000 units sold worldwide during the quarter.

<TEXT>
Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said yesterday
it was 'impossible to avoid a clear loss' for 1993, AP-DJ reports from
Frankfurt.
The company said it was confident it would return to profitability in 1994.
In 1992 Opel reported a net profit of DM202m (Dollars 116m).
The company reported group sales falling 24 per cent to 'more than DM22bn'
from DM29.2bn a year earlier, but did not provide a precise figure for 1993.
While GM Europe remained profitable in 1993, Opel said several factors
pushed Adam Opel into the red. These were DM160m to fund shortened shifts
and DM350m for early retirement and severance pay, as well as DM380m in
losses from exchange rate fluctuations.
Opel reported output slid 24 per cent to 1.074m units in 1993 from 1.411m
units a year earlier.
The combined European market share for Opel and Vauxhall cars increased 0.7
of a percentage point to 12.7 per cent, the highest in Europe, according to
Opel. Car registrations, however, declined 11.5 per cent to 1.33m units from
1.62m a year earlier, the company reported.
In Germany, Opel's market share declined 0.5 percentage points to 16.6 per
cent, it said. New car registrations plunged 21 per cent to 529,000 from
671,000 a year earlier.

Kimberley-Clark, the US paper products company best known for its Huggies
disposable nappies and Kleenex tissues, said higher sales volumes and lower
costs helped turn last year's fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 55.8m into a
net profit of Dollars 141.6m this time.
The previous year's figure was hit by restructuring costs that reduced
earnings by Dollars 172m, but the company said net income would still have
been up by 22 per cent if that charge was excluded from the comparison.
Earnings per share were 88 cents compared with last year's loss of 35 cents.
For the full year, net income rose from Dollars 135m to Dollars 510.9m and
earnings per share rose from 84 cents to Dollars 3.18.

Shrewd gold hedging and improved cost control enabled Anglo American's gold
mines to lift after-tax profit to R582.2m (Dollars 171.2m) in the three
months to December, from R498.6m the previous quarter. In the December 1992
quarter, the mines reported after-tax profit of R482.1m.
Quarterly gold output edged forward to 66,115kg from 65,773kg. The average
gold price received improved to R39,793 a kg from R39,320 a kg, although it
remained below the average spot price of R40,200.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman, said the outlook for gold was particularly
uncertain, with the price likely to range from Dollars 360 to Dollars 430 an
ounce in 1994.
He said the belief that a collapse in share prices would be good for gold no
longer held true, because it was high price-to-earnings ratios on Wall
Street which had tempted fund managers to invest in gold in 1993. Any
retreat in equities might trigger a fall in gold prices, as stock markets
became more attractive for investors.
The mines' average working costs rose only 1 per cent to R29,358 after they
deteriorated by 7 per cent in the previous quarter. Seasonal fluctuations
contributed to a sharp rise in capital spending, to R314.9m from R233.6m.
Mines in the Transvaal declared final dividends for the year to December 31,
which demonstrated the extent to which shareholders gained from last year's
rally in bullion prices. Vaal Reefs, the group's most profitable mine,
declared a 23 per cent improved total dividend of R13.70 a share against
R11.10 in 1992, while Western Deep Levels' total payout surged more than 80
per cent, to R5.60.
Vaal Reefs' south division hit 'abnormally' good patches of ground which,
with a tax rebate, was partly behind the jump in after-tax income, to
R217.5m from R174.9m.
Western Deep Level achieved its highest gold output since 1980, producing
11,210kg of gold. Freegold turned in a flat performance, but re-organising
underground operations at Elandsrand knocked productivity and pushed up
costs.
Northam Platinum, the struggling young platinum producer owned by Gold
Fields of South Africa, reported a R58m operating loss in the half-year to
December 31, against a loss of R50.7m in year to June 30.

Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software supplier, reported
a 22 per cent increase in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 289m from
Dollars 236m.
The figures translated into earnings per share of 95 cents, up from 78
cents, and were struck on revenues 20 per cent higher at Dollars 1.22bn. The
results were in line with expectations.
Microsoft said several factors contributed to the improvement, including an
enthusiastic response to the latest editions of Microsoft Office in the US,
together with the 'ongoing adoption of the Microsoft Windows operating
system'.
For the six months, it reported net income of Dollars 528m, or Dollars 1.74
a share, up from Dollars 445m, or Dollars 1.48, in the same period of last
year.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil faces Dollars 957m tax
demand
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pennzoil, the US oil company, has been presented with a tax demand for
Dollars 957m from the Internal Revenue Service over a settlement it received
six years ago after a long-running dispute with Texaco.
The IRS has ruled that Pennzoil should pay tax on the Dollars 2.2bn of the
Dollars 3bn settlement which it invested in shares in another oil company,
Chevron.
Pennzoil, which has paid tax on the remaining Dollars 800m, has always
argued that the larger part of the settlement should not be taxed.
It said it had received a ruling from the IRS that its 1988 income should be
increased by Dollars 2.2bn. This created a tax deficiency for the year of
Dollars 551m, plus additional after-tax interest of Dollars 234m.
Pennzoil said the IRS had disallowed Dollars 366m of litigation and other
costs related to the dispute with Texaco, and that this would produce a tax
deficiency of Dollars 125m, plus interest of Dollars 47m. The company said
it continued to dispute the issue, and would appeal.
It said it had the financial resources necessary to deal with any ruling
that followed. Late last year, Pennzoil sold Dollars 721m of Chevron stock,
prompting speculation that it was building cash reserves in case the IRS
ruling went against it.
The Dollars 3bn settlement followed a dispute over Texaco's acquisition of
Getty Oil in the 1980s.

acquisition

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Australia Bank (NAB), the largest and strongest of the Australian
banks and the owner of various regional banks in the UK and Ireland, said
yesterday it was still looking for an acquisition in the US.
Mr Bill Irvine, the chairman, also told shareholders at yesterday's annual
meeting that the bank was not as strong as it wanted to be in the south of
England and in the Republic of Ireland. Acquisitions in these areas, along
with the US, would take precedence over any purchases in Australia, he said.
Speculation that NAB would seek to acquire a US banking business has been
rife for some time. Unlike some of its rivals, who are still retrenching,
the bank has weathered the recession in fairly good shape, and can afford to
look to new markets.
However, several analysts have questioned whether NAB's enthusiasm for a US
deal might have faded in the face of the recent consolidation within the
banking sector there. This has arguably removed some of the most attractive
acquisition candidates from the field.
NAB, which owns the Clydesdale, Yorkshire, Northern and National Irish
banks, also said the current year had started well, and that it expected to
'record a further satisfactory improvement in results over the current
year'.
In 1992-93, NAB's profit after tax but before abnormal items, rose by a
third, to ADollars 1.07bn (USDollars 746m).

<TEXT>
Sanshin, a Japanese non-life insurance company affiliated with Sanwa Bank, a
leading commercial bank, is to set up a joint reinsurance venture in the UK
with Robert Fleming Insurance Brokers, a member of the UK merchant bank
group.
Sanshin Fleming Reinsurance Brokers will be established in London this
month, with Sanshin and Robert Fleming Insurance each holding 42.5 per cent
stakes, and Japan England Insurance Brokers the remaining 15 per cent.
The company will be the first Japanese insurance company to be involved in
the reinsurance business. The move comes ahead of the deregulation of the
Japanese insurance market in 1996, when insurance brokers are expected to be
allowed into the market.
The Japanese insurance industry, one of the country's most tightly-regulated
financial markets, is bracing itself ahead of the liberalisation, and trying
to expand and diversify operations.
Sanshin said it wanted to acquire know-how of the reinsurance business, and
hoped to eventually win contracts from Japanese insurance companies, which
currently rely on European and US reinsurers.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese rivals join forces to
make flash memory chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric are linking to produce flash memory chips,
in an unusual alliance between two Japanese competitors.
The two companies will co-develop 16-megabit flash memory - an advanced
silicon chip which 'remembers' what has been written on it without the need
for constant electronic refreshment - using technology developed by each
company.
Because they are smaller and use less power than hard-disk drives, flash
chips are expected to replace them eventually, particularly in portable
computers.
The alliance between Hitachi and Mitsubishi underscores the high cost of
setting up semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and the enormous
resources needed to be a leading producer in the market.
The partnership 'involves a sharing of resources in the areas of research
and development as well as production, and as such is an undertaking of
great significance to the future progress and development of each company',
said Mr Tsugio Makimoto, executive managing director at Hitachi.
However, at the same time it demonstrates the extent to which Japanese
companies have suffered under the economic downturn and the fall in asset
prices.
A few years ago, financing the construction of a semiconductor facility,
estimated at about Dollars 1bn, may not have been such a difficult decision
for either company, says Mr Barry Dargan, industry analyst at SG Warburg.
SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, the Franco-Italian semiconductor group which
has an alliance with Mitsubishi in flash memories, is also expected to join
the Japanese partnership. Its involvement could bring the alliance a
valuable route into the European market.
However, the flash memory market is currently dominated by Intel, of the US,
followed by Toshiba. Meanwhile, prices have failed to fall as quickly as
expected. Consequently, flash has been slow to replace disk drives, Mr
Dargan says.
While demand for flash chips has continued to be strong, prices will need to
come down further. The chips are expected to grow into a Dollars 8bn market
by 2000.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Record traffic levels helped produce a 22 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 235m for Union Pacific, the US rail
and natural resources group reported yesterday.
However, CSX, another of the biggest rail operators, turned in a slight
decline to Dollars 151m from Dollars 152m for the same period because of the
effects on coal loadings of weak export demand and the US miners' strike.
For Union Pacific, the traffic growth came from four main sectors. Car and
truck deliveries were up by 12 per cent, coal carryings rose by 14 per cent,
chemicals were up by 4 per cent, and intermodal traffic rose by 6 per cent.
The group saw strong growth at Union Pacific Resources, its oil and gas
subsidiary, which increased earnings by 36 per cent on the back of higher
volumes and an increase in gas prices. Earnings per share for the quarter
were 21 per cent up at Dollars 1.14.
Full-year figures, reflecting losses caused by the Midwest floods, showed a
decline in net income to Dollars 530m from Dollars 728m, but Union Pacific
said the latest figure would have been Dollars 705m without the effect of
non-recurring charges for accounting adjustments totalling Dollars 175m.
At CSX, depressed coal loadings were mostly offset by gains in the company's
other transport activities in the fourth quarter, and earnings per share
were little changed at Dollars 1.46, compared with Dollars 1.47.
For the year, net income rose to Dollars 359m from Dollars 20m because the
previous year included a restructuring charge. Full-year earnings per share
were Dollars 3.46 compared with 19 cents.

Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday
announced a 45 per cent fall in net profits last year, from FFr2.37bn in
1992 to FFr1.31bn (Dollars 220m).
It blamed the fall on the difficult economic conditions in Europe which had
a serious impact on several group activities. Overall sales fell from
FFr74bn to FFr71.6bn, while operating profits fell from FFr6.4bn to
FFr4.9bn.
Despite the decline, Saint-Gobain reduced debts by FFr3bn, to an estimated
FFr15bn, as a result of its cost-cutting measures.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Monsanto, the US chemicals group, matched market expectations with steady
annual earnings growth in the final quarter as cost-cutting took effect and
sales edged ahead by less than 1 per cent.
Leaving aside one-off items, fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 46m, or
39 cents a share, up from Dollars 12m, or 9 cents, the year before. Sales
were Dollars 17m higher, at Dollars 1.88bn.
In the latest period, the company reported an after-tax gain of 16 cents a
share from a one-off reduction in working capital inventories, and a 6 cents
a share charge to cover the sale or withdrawal of some products.
The latest figures reflect sales growth in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and
agricultural products, offset by a Dollars 50m decline in sales of
NutraSweet, to Dollars 188m.
Leaving aside one-off charges in both periods, the pharmaceuticals business
consolidated its return to operating profitability, achieved in the previous
quarter, with operating income of Dollars 25m.
The chemicals division made operating profits of Dollars 55m, up from
Dollars 26m, largely as a result of cost-cutting.
For the year, before all non-recurring items, net income was Dollars 460m,
or Dollars 3.82 a share, up from Dollars 346m or Dollars 2.81 in 1992.
On Wall Street, Monsanto's stock fell Dollars 1 7/8 to close at Dollars 78
1/8 as profit-taking brought it down from its high for the previous 12
months.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers held back by
Dollars 500m pre-tax charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US drugs group, has taken a Dollars 500m pre-tax
charge to cover a possible settlement of breast implant claims, cutting into
fourth-quarter earnings which were otherwise much in line with expectations.
The company said it expected its share of a proposed Dollars 4.75bn global
settlement of claims over leaking breast implants to reach Dollars 1.5bn,
Dollars 1bn of which would be covered by insurance payments.
The extent of its insurance coverage is still the subject of litigation,
Bristol-Myers said, though it added that it believed it would eventually
receive more than Dollars 1bn.
Leaving aside this charge and a one-off item the year before, fourth-quarter
earnings reached Dollars 566m or Dollars 1.10 a share, up 7 per cent from
the corresponding period last year.
The results reflect a 6 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 2.99bn. in the
latest period, in line with expectations.
The company said it had not experienced any moves by drug wholesalers to
reduce their inventory. This was blamed by Pfizer the day before for its
sales slow-down.
The Pfizer news surprised Wall Street and had sent the shares of all drug
companies lower on fears that drug pricing was coming under greater pressure
than expected.
For the year, Bristol-Myers' drug sales, which contributed about 55 per cent
to revenues of Dollars 11.4bn, rose 3 per cent. Other areas were slightly
ahead, though sales of consumer products fell 1 per cent, in part as a
result of increased competition in the US.
Fourth-quarter net income of American Home Products, the US drugs and
healthcare group, was Dollars 382m or Dollars 1.23 a share, up from Dollars
361m or Dollars 1.16. Full-year net income rose to Dollars 1.47bn or Dollars
4.73 a share from Dollars 1.37bn or Dollars 4.36 before one-off charges and
accounting adjustments in 1992.
Total sales during the quarter rose nearly 6 per cent, to Dollars 2.1bn,
buoyed by a 13 per cent rise in consumer healthcare products, to Dollars
1.7bn.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica recovers strongly
in second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, said a
recovery in the second half of last year meant it should break even in 1993
in spite of a L159.9bn (Dollars 97.3m) loss in the first half.
The recovery forecast, made after a board meeting in Rome, is largely the
result of the flotation or sale of a number of subsidiaries in the closing
months of last year. These moves realised substantial extraordinary gains
and helped reduce the group's heavy debts.
Group sales dropped to L10,450bn from L11,200bn, largely because of the
recession in the aerospace business and cuts in defence spending, which hit
Finmeccanica's Alenia subsidiary.
The group said the disposal drive would continue with the sale of its Esaote
Biomedica medical equipment subsidiary, which is expected to be bought by a
management team.
Asset sales helped reduce net group indebtedness to about L5,250bn at the
end of last year from L5,310bn the previous year. However, the fall was much
more substantial when measured against end-June 1993, when net debts stood
at L6,311bn.
Finmeccanica's order book remained littled changed at L22,100bn at the end
of last year against L22,300 in December 1992.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: CBoT approves trading floor
expansion

<TEXT>
Members of the Chicago Board of Trade, the big US futures exchange, have
approved plans for a badly-needed trading floor expansion. The expansion
plan was voted down twice in 1993.
The plan provides Dollars 26m to acquire a building just east of the
exchange's LaSalle and Jackson Street headquarters. Members are expected to
approve plans to build a 60,000 sq ft trading facility on the site for a
cost of about Dollars 171m in another ballot in the spring.
The new building, to be connected to the CBoT by a walkway, will more than
double the CBoT's trading space, and will be among the most costly trading
floors built in the US.
The new floor will house the exchange's financial futures and options pits.
Construction is expected to begin this summer.
Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, won members over by promising not to raise
trading fees to pay for the expansion.
The exchange intends to finance the project from general revenues.
The CBoT traded a record 178m contracts last year, and Mr Arbor has said
that with proper facilities and recent growth rates, volume could double by
1998.
The CBoT's rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, opened a new trading
floor in July, doubling trading space there to 70,000 sq ft. That expansion
was completed at a cost of Dollars 27m.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica sees break-even
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, said a
recovery in the second half of last year meant it should break even in 1993
in spite of a L159.9bn (Dollars 97.3m) loss in the first half.
The recovery forecast, made after a board meeting in Rome, is largely the
result of the flotation or sale of a number of subsidiaries in the closing
months of last year. These moves realised substantial extraordinary gains
and helped reduce the group's heavy debts.
Group sales dropped to L10,450bn from L11,200bn, largely because of the
recession in the aerospace business and cuts in defence spending, which hit
Finmeccanica's Alenia subsidiary.
The group said the disposal drive would continue with the sale of its Esaote
Biomedica medical equipment subsidiary, which is expected to be bought by a
management team.
Asset sales helped reduce net group indebtedness to about L5,250bn at the
end of last year from L5,310bn the previous year.
However, the fall was much more substantial when measured against end-June
1993, when net debts stood at L6,311bn. Finmeccanica's order book remained
littled changed at L22,100bn at the end of last year against L22,300 in
December 1992.
Meanwhile, the group moved a step closer to taking over the defence
operations of the former Efim state holding company with the appointment of
Lehman Brothers and San Paolo Finance to advise on valuing the assets being
transfered. Several auditing companies will advise Efim's special
commissioner.

<TEXT>
General Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 10 per cent
increase in fourth-quarter earnings and a 22 per cent rise in profits from
its ongoing operations.
Earnings totalled Dollars 1.48bn, or Dollars 1.73 a share, compared with
Dollars 1.34bn, or Dollars 1.57, in the same period of last year.
The 1992 fourth quarter included Dollars 126m of earnings from GE's
aerospace business, which it sold to Martin Marietta for Dollars 3bn. GE
said excluding this, earnings rose 22 per cent.
Revenues rose 12 per cent to Dollars 18.08bn from Dollars 16.2bn. GE said
there had been good growth in appliances, GE Capital Services, plastics,
power systems and transportation.
For the full year, GE reported earnings before accounting changes up 10 per
cent to Dollars 5.18bn, or Dollars 6.06, from Dollars 4.73bn, or Dollars
5.51, on revenues 6 per cent ahead at Dollars 60.6bn. Earnings from
continuing operations rose 16 per cent.
Mr Jack Welch, the chairman, said the company had delivered excellent
performance in a difficult global economy in 1993.
Eleven of its 12 businesses improved net earnings and 10, led by GE Capital,
television broadcaster NBC, plastics and power stations, had achieved double
digit increases.
Earnings from aircraft engines, which has been suffering from the downturn
in the airline industry, were much lower than in 1992.
The group's on-going operating margin rose to a record 12.5 per cent from
1992's 11.5 per cent, while cash generated from continuing operations
reached a record Dollars 5.2bn, driven by an improvement in inventory turns
to six.
Mr Welch said GE entered 1994 with 'a strong balance sheet and cash flows
and an excellent outlook for growth'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the big Spanish bank at the centre of the rescue of
the rival Banesto group, yesterday reported a 2.3 per cent rise in net
profits for 1993 to Pta71bn (Dollars 504m).
During the previous 12 months profits fell nearly 20 per cent, leading the
company to claim yesterday it had consolidated a healthy core banking
business.
The results were ahead of forecasts. These had suggested the group would
return flat profits because lower domestic interest rates last year were
expected to penalise BBV, which has a short-term concentration in its loan
portfolio and a position as a net lender on the interbank market.
Reduced BBV equity in companies that consolidate with the banking group
contributed to holding down the net income figure and disguised a 14.9 per
cent rise in operating profit to Pta155bn.
The bank's capital base topped Pta730bn at the end of 1993 to give it a BIS
capital ratio above 12 per cent and its total assets increased by 15.4 per
cent to Pta11,600bn, making it the largest financial institution in Spain.
BBV has lent scores of senior and middle-ranking executives to Banesto to
salvage the troubled bank following the intervention of the authorities
three weeks ago.

<TEXT>
Nestle, the packaged foods and mineral waters group, has reported a 5.4 per
cent rise in 1993 sales to SFr57.5bn (Dollars 39.4bn), in spite of
recessionary conditions and currency devaluations in many of its main
European markets.
The group said that sales volume, excluding the effect of acquisitions, grew
only 1.7 per cent last year, compared with 3.3 per cent in 1992. However,
volume grew strongly in Asia and in North and South America. Among product
groups, drinks, milk products and pharmaceuticals had good volume growth.
On 1993 profits, Nestle said only that it expected an increase over the 1992
net income of SFr2.7bn. Mr Helmut Maucher said in November that profit would
rise by roughly the same extent as sales.
It anticipated further increases in sales and profits in the current year
unless the European recession deepened or exchange rates took 'a very
unfavourable turn' against the Swiss franc.
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the armaments and retailing group, said its 1993 sales
dropped 16 per cent to just under SFr3bn, mainly because of the completion
of large military contracts.
Operating income was 'distinctly lower' than last year's SFr232m, but net
income was expected to be better than last year's SFr37.2m because of
financial and extraordinary gains. No dividend could be paid because of
accumulated losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sphinx, the Netherlands-based producer of sanitary fittings and bathroom
furniture, has agreed to acquire Gustavsberg, a Swedish manufacturer of
showers and baths, in a move that will double the Dutch company's size and
increase its product range.
After the acquisition, which Sphinx described yesterday as a merger because
the two companies plan to act as partners, the new group will have turnover
of around Fl 800m (Dollars 410m), nearly twice as much as the Fl 425m in
sales generated by Sphinx.
Gustavsberg is being sold by Nordico, part of Sweden's KF supermarket group,
for an undisclosed price.
Sphinx, which said it might make a small share issue to raise money for the
deal, also declined to give the purchase price but said the acquisition
would contribute immediately to profit per share.
Initial financing will come from a credit line from ABN-Amro Bank of the
Netherlands and from Sphinx's internal cash flow.
The two companies are largely complementary, with Gustavsberg particularly
strong in showers and shower systems. These are products which Sphinx has,
until now, had to buy in from outside suppliers.
The new company, which is likely to be called Sphinx-Gustavsberg, will
generate nearly one-third of its sales in the Benelux countries and another
third in Germany. It will be based in Sphinx's home town of Maastricht.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Private shareholders threaten to
withdraw from Portuguese group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Private shareholders who own 25 per cent of Petrogal, Portugal's partially
privatised oil company and largest commercial enterprise, have told the
government they may withdraw from the company because of difficulties in
meeting a commitment to purchase a further 26 per cent of the equity.
The private group, dominated by Total, the French oil company, purchased a
25 per cent stake in Petrogal in the first stage of the company's
privatisation in 1992. The terms of the sale obliges the group to buy a
further 26 per cent by July 1995 for an estimated Es45bn (Dollars 255m).
The private shareholders, grouped together in the holding company
Petrocontrol, have been trying to negotiate an alternative deal with the
Portuguese finance ministry because of difficulties in raising the necessary
capital by the deadline.
Petrocontrol has indicated that it is prepared to pull out of Petrogal if an
agreement cannot be reached. A withdrawal is likely to lead to the purchase
of the stake by other private investors.
Total holds 48 per cent of the voting rights in Petrocontrol. The remainder
of the capital is divided between nine Portuguese institutional and
individual investors. Portuguese law prohibits foreign investors from
holding, directly or indirectly, a majority of the privately-owned capital
of Petrogal.
According to the terms of Petrogal's privatisation, if Petrocontrol fails to
purchase an additional 26 per cent of the company by the deadline, it will
be required to forfeit 6 per cent of its holding and have the option of
selling the remaining 19 per cent back to the state at the original price of
the privatisation.
Mr Luis Mira Amaral, minister for industry and energy, reportedly insists on
Petrocontrol agreeing to buy the additional 26 per cent before he will agree
to a badly-needed capital increase for Petrogal.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Time Warner in anti-takeover
move
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Time Warner, the US media group in which Canada's Seagram drinks company has
built up an 11 per cent stake, announced yesterday it was introducing a
poison pill anti-takeover device which will prevent any investor buying more
than 15 per cent of its stock.
Seagram, which is controlled by the Bronfman family and began buying Time
Warner stock last summer, has announced plans to buy up to 15 per cent of
the company's shares for investment purposes.
Time Warner is apparently concerned that Seagram's stake could turn out to
be unfriendly, though the company yesterday sought to portray the poison
pill as a general response to the takeover wave sweeping the US media
industry.
Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, said yesterday's action 'in no way
interferes with Seagram's stated objective to acquire up to 15 per cent of
Time Warner's stock as a friendly and supportive investor'.
Seagram said the move did not appear to interfere with its objectives but
added it did not believe poison pills were in the best interests of
shareholders, since they could interfere with choice and adversely affect
values.
The drinks company has no large interests in the entertainment business but
Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, its young president, has dabbled in film production
and has expressed enthusiasm for the media industry.
Time Warner said it had developed the pill following concern from several
institutional investors and the group's strategic partners.
Its partners include US West, the Baby Bell regional telephone company, and
Japanese companies Toshiba and Itochu, each of which owns a stake in the
group's cable and entertainment operations.
Time Warner said the pill, known formally as a shareholder rights plan,
would not preclude a bona-fide all-cash offer for the company which treated
all shareholders equally.
It was designed to protect against 'abusive takeover tactics, including
acquisition of control without paying all shareholders a fair premium'.
The scheme is triggered if an investor buys more than 15 per cent of the
company's stock. That gives all shareholders - apart from the 15 per cent
investor - the right to buy stock at a large discount.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief spells
out survival strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, warned
yesterday of 'massive' job losses at the Frankfurt-based group and gave
details of the company's future strategy.
Mr Neukirchen, renowned as one of Germany's toughest company doctors, wrote
in the Frankfurt-based group's in-house newspaper that the job cuts would be
necessary to guarantee its survival.
He did not quantify the scale of the reduction in the workforce but the
tenor of the article suggested that job cuts will prove to be more than the
10,000 out of 58,000 he indicated after the group was rescued by bankers
last weekend.
Mr Neukirchen said the group would focus on three core operating areas -
trading, chemicals and plant construction. Many of the group's 258
subsidiaries both in Germany and abroad would be sold.
Significantly absent from the list of future core activities are the group's
mining businesses - bundled together in the 50.1-per cent owned Canadian
subsidiary Metall Mining Corporation (MMC) - or its metals smelting
activities.
Mr Neukirchen has already hinted that the continuing ownership of MMC will
come under review. He has said that the smelters - highly efficient
producers of metals such as zinc, copper and lead after huge investment in
updated technology by Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Mr Neukirchen's predecessor -
may be closed.
Mr Neukirchen repeated his pledge to sell off the company's majority stake
in Kolbenschmidt, a manufacturer of motor vehicle components such as
steering-wheels and air-bags, together with two smaller investments. He
warned that in the trading area he would close or sell non-core and
capital-intensive businesses.
He said that 'from today's perspective' there was no intention to sell the
following companies, commonly deemed the jewels in the Metallgesellschaft
crown: Buderus (heating equipment and other industrial products); Dynamit
Nobel (explosives and specialty chemicals); Lurgi, Lentjes and Zimmer, three
plant construction subsidiaries; and BUS Berzelius Umwelt-Service, a
recycling company.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sandoz sees income rise of 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandoz, the Basle-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, said its
consolidated sales last year grew 5 per cent to SFr15.1bn (Dollars 10.3bn),
and it expected to report a 'marked increase' in net income of more than 10
per cent over 1992's SFr1.49bn.
Weak trends in industrial chemicals were more than offset by the continuing
strength of pharmaceutical sales.
Fourth-quarter sales of the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for
nearly half of total group sales, were up a brisk 10 per cent to SFr1.9bn.
Sales of Sandimmun, used to combat rejection of transplanted organs, were up
15 per cent, while those of Clozaril, a drug used for schizophrenia, soared
60 per cent.
In the full year, pharmaceutical sales were up 7 per cent to SFr7.35bn.
Chemical sales were flat in the fourth quarter at SFr585m, but up 2 per cent
in the full year to SFr2.5bn. Sandoz said the performance was above the
industry average due in part to increases in textile dyestuffs sales in the
US, Brazil and parts of Asia.
Agro-chemical sales dropped 7 per cent in the fourth quarter to SFr240m
because of a delayed start to the 1993-1994 season, but were up 7 per cent
in the full year to SFr1.3bn, thanks to new environmentally friendly
herbicides and fungicides.
Sales of the construction and environment division jumped 12 per cent to
SFr1.2bn in the full year, with above average results in the US and the Far
East.

FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust turns in surge for
quarter
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank, reported a further surge in profits
from trading in financial markets in the final three months of last year, at
a time when easing volatility in European markets cut into trading profits
at other big US banks.
Like JP Morgan, which reported its 1993 earnings last week, the bank boosted
its trading profits in the emerging country debt markets, and bolstering
dwindling income from the European currency and interest rate markets.
The value of debt securities issued by a number of Latin American and
emerging Asian countries rose strongly last year on stronger economic
fundamentals and demand from US investors for high-yielding investments.
Income from trading rose to Dollars 449m in the last quarter of 1993, up
from Dollars 101m a year before and ahead of the record Dollars 431m of the
previous quarter.
In all, trading income contributed 36 per cent of the revenues in the latest
quarter. Further unspecified trading profits, made in interest rate markets
and accounted for as net interest income, further lifted this portion.
The results boosted the bank's net income in the final three months to
Dollars 279m, or Dollars 3.25 a share, up from Dollars 133m, restated as
Dollars 1.49 a share, the year before and well ahead of analysts' estimates.
Earnings per share calculations for the latest and previous periods were
adjusted to take account of equity-related items like stock options the bank
has issued, diluting the final eps figure.
After-tax profits for the year as a whole reached Dollars 1.07bn, or Dollars
12.40 a share, up from Dollars 639m, or Dollars 7.22 a share, in 1992,
before various accounting changes in both periods.
Both Bankers Trust and JP Morgan have shaken off the revenue slowdown faced
by other US banks by moving heavily into trading activities and growing
their fee and commission-related business.

<TEXT>
Turnover of John D Wood, the estate agent, expanded 36 per cent from Pounds
2.37m to Pounds 3.22m and resulted in a return to profits with Pounds

interim of 0.75p.
All eight of the group's London sales offices performed well, 'the market
having improved at all levels with the number of of sales increasing by over
50 per cent', directors pointed out.
They added that since the end of October the recovery in volumes and house
prices had been sustained 'and we expect this trend to continue'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Static turnover and profits were yesterday reported by William Ransom, the
pharmaceutical products maker, for the six months to end-September.
On turnover down from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.31m pre-tax profits came out
at Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 289,000). There was severe pressure on prices but
the weaker pound boosted exports.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.22p (1.24p) and in line with the
company's previously stated intention to reduce disparity, the interim
dividend is increased by 46 per cent to 0.769p (0.525p).
The company also announced it had appointed Mr David Brown as chief
executive.
Mr Brown, aged 53, is a qualified pharmacist and has held senior managerial
positions with Amersham International and Serono Laboratories (UK). He will
join the company on February 1.

deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing losses were yesterday reported by Whinney Mackay-Lewis for the
six months to end-October, although a 'significant improvement' is foreseen
for the second half.
Helped by a lower interest charge of Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 244,000), the
USM-quoted architect and planner turned in a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds
282,000 (Pounds 353,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.97m). Losses
per share, however, widened from 3.7p to 4.3p.
Mr Jeremy Mackay-Lewis, chairman, said the level of commissions and
enquiries had continued to improve, and the order book had increased
substantially in recent months.
Nevertheless, it could be a while yet before a resumption of dividends could
be considered, he added.

<TEXT>
Directors of International Food Machinery said yesterday that approaches had
been received from two parties interested in strengthening management and
injecting working cap-ital.
They added that the approaches were at a preliminary stage and that a
further statement would be made as soon as practicable.
Commenting on the 1993 year, directors said that while no indication of the
results could yet be given, trading in the last two months 'continued to be
poor.'
For 1992 profits before tax totalled Pounds 1.05m. In the opening six months
of 1993 they rose from Pounds 292,000 to Pounds 878,000 but in November the
company warned that the full year figures were likely to be 'substantially
below' market estimates.
The food processing and refrigeration equipment company came to market in
December 1992 with the shares priced at 51p.
They closed 3p lower yesterday at 20p.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods US arm pays Dollars 4.5m fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Waste Industries, a US subsidiary of Attwoods, has reached a
settlement which concludes the US government's investigation into its
business.
EWI has pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud, and has paid a Dollars
4.5m (Pounds 3m) fine.
The position which led to the investigation was first disclosed by Attwoods
itself in an internal audit from which it appeared that there had been
over-billing by EWI for landfill services. This had arisen some years before
Attwoods' acquisition of the business.
EWI has made restitution, with interest, to every customer affected, more
than 90 per cent of whom have continued to deal with the company.
Attwoods said that the provision made in the accounts for the 1992 year was
sufficient for both the fine and all reimbursements to customers.
Legal costs are expected to total some Dollars 3m, and will be charged as an
exceptional item in the accounts for the current year.
Attwoods is a leading waste management group, and provides services in the
UK, mainland Europe, the US, the Caribbean and Israel.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hampson jumps 47% and reviews expansion
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hampson Industries, the West Bromwich-based diversified industrial group,
checked the trend of lower profits with a 47 per cent increase in the first
half, accompanied by an increased interim dividend.
The improvement is encouraging the group, which in the face of difficult
markets had been seeking growth organically, to review expansion plans.
'We may bring our acquisitions policy forward somewhat, but there is nothing
imminent,' said Mr Ian Walker, managing director.
Pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30 were Pounds 2.48m, against
Pounds 1.69m, achieved on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds
43.5m (Pounds 35.2m).
Diluted earnings per share rose from 1.5p to 2.16p, while the interim
dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 0.5p.
The group reported better performances across its four main activities:
furniture, precision engineering with a concentration on aircraft
refurbishment, cleaning and aluminium refining.
The furniture operations were badly hit last year by the devaluation of
sterling which suddenly raised imported raw material prices.
Changing the source of the materials and introducing new product lines led
to a return to profit by last May, Mr Walker said.
The improvement has helped reduce gearing. It was 72 per cent at the end of
the 1992-93 first half and Mr Walker expects it to be just over 40 per cent
by the end of this financial year.
Hampson is finding the upturn in its markets 'patchy' but expects 'results
for the second half to be an improvement on the corresponding period last
year' although it would not forecast the size of a profits increase.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Carpetright rises to Pounds 5.51m - Market
share advances from 6% at flotation to 9% and 20% is seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carpetright, the retailer floated by Sir Phil Harris last year, reported
interim profits of Pounds 5.51m in the 26 weeks to October 30, up from about
Pounds 3m in the comparable 26 weeks of 1992 and Pounds 3.4m in the 28 weeks
to November 14.
The shares, which were floated at 148p, yesterday fell 7p to 270p.
Sir Phil put the sharp rise in profits down to an increase in market share
from about 6 per cent at the time of the float last June to about 9 per cent
now, combined with a fast rate of new store openings.
Sales through comparable stores had risen by 19 per cent even though the
carpet market was dull, falling by an estimated 5 per cent.
Carpetright's prices were 2 per cent or 3 per cent lower than a year ago, as
the benefit of deals with suppliers was passed on to customers.
Group turnover was Pounds 50.5m in the half year, compared with about Pounds
35m last time.
The rise in volume led to an increase in net margins from 8.4 per cent to
10.4 per cent, while gross margins were unchanged at about 45 per cent.
An interim dividend of 2.7p is declared, with earnings per share at 4.66p.
Sir Phil said the split between interim and final would be 40:60.
He was 'quite satisfied' with current trading, sales and profits in the
January sales being above budget. He said the recently announced merger of
Allied and Carpetland would allow Carpetright to increase its target of
stores in the UK from 200 to 240.
However, he said the faster than expected rate of opening stores, up from an
annual 20-25 to 30-35, meant that the target would be reached over the same
three year period. By then he expected to have about 20 per cent of the UK
carpet market.
Carpetright opened 13 stores in the first half taking the total to 127. By
the financial year end there should be 147 stores.
After the proceeds of the flotation were used to repay the preference
shares, the group increased its cash from Pounds 7.99m in the May 1 balance
sheet to Pounds 15.6m at October 30. Interest received was Pounds 264,000 in
the half year.
Sir Phil said eventually Carpetright would like to buy the freeholds of its
shops, but these were currently too expensive. However, it planned to invest
the cash in paying suppliers earlier in return for a discount. This would
earn much more than keeping the cash in the bank, he said.

profits sharply increased over the 12 months to September 30.
On turnover marginally ahead to Pounds 67m, profits improved from Pounds

decline over the previous three years, but Mr John Silk, chairman, said
yesterday that all group business were profitable during the year, except
the forging side and that was expected to return to the black in the next
few months.
Earnings jumped to 9.91p (1.95p) and a final dividend of 4.1p lifts the
total 10 per cent to 6.2p. The group also proposed its usual scrip issue,
this time on a 1-for-10 basis.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Airtours warns of higher interim losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the travel group, yesterday warned shareholders to expect a
significant increase in half-year losses as a result of recent acquisitions.
Mr David Crossland, chairman, told the AGM yesterday that while bookings
were up, new acquisitions meant that seasonal profit fluctuations were
likely to be higher. Holiday companies usually incur losses over the winter
months and make their profits in the summer.
In the first six months of last year, Airtours recorded a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 15.9m, including nearly Pounds 9m spent on its unsuccessful bid for
rival tour company Owners Abroad. Full-year pre-tax profits increased by 25
per cent to Pounds 45.5m.
Mr Crossland said holiday bookings for winter 1993-94 were currently up 46
per cent on the same time last year. Summer 1994 bookings were ahead 56 per
cent.
Over the past two years, Airtours has purchased Aspro, a tour operator, and
the Hogg Robinson and Pickfords travel agency chains. Hogg Robinson and
Pickfords have been combined to form a chain called Going Places.

Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, told shareholders yesterday that
first-half profits for Bass Brewers would be affected by an additional cost
of about Pounds 10m in respect of end-product duty introduced in June.
However, this would be offset partially by an improvement in bad debts.
At Bass Taverns, profits to date were ahead of the comparable period.
However, the reduced number of houses would effect profits by some Pounds 9m
in the first half.
The shares fell 16p to 592p.

Trustin achieved profits before tax of Pounds 435,000 for the nine months to
end-December and had net assets at that date of Pounds 755,000.
The accountants certified that Trustin's pre-tax profits for the period
amounted to Pounds 629,887 and that net assets of Vaydean and

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Aim shares lose 15p as profits dive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings, fell
58 per cent in the six months to October 31. And the second half is expected
to be hit by the delay in a large contract.
The shares lost 15p to 150p. When the company warned of the difficulties
with a Saab contract in November, the shares fell 30p to 143p.
On turnover 24 per cent lower at Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 20.4m), including
Pounds 152,000 (Pounds 950,000) from property development, pre-tax profits
were Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 2.82m). The comparable figure included Pounds
1.34m from profit on disposal of subsidiaries.
Earnings per share were 5.4p (15.9p) and the interim dividend is maintained
at 1.5p.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Simon Eng aims for Pounds 40m from
disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Engineering, maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear,
yesterday announced plans to raise Pounds 40m through disposals and warned
of a small operating loss for the second half of 1993.
The disposals of both businesses and properties are part of a plan aimed at
cutting debt and concentrating on core markets.
Since Mr Maurice Dixson became chief executive in a boardroom shake-out of
the group in September, debt has declined from Pounds 148m to Pounds 128m.
The reduction has followed the sale of Simon's 50 per cent share in TR Oil
Services last month for Pounds 6.2m and three smaller sales worth a total of
Pounds 2.5m.
In addition, the group said it had introduced tight cash controls in the
second half, resulting in a positive cash flow.
'We're making the progress that we said we would, and quite a bit is coming
early in the cycle,' said Mr Dixson yesterday. 'This is not rhetoric, but
real things happening.'
Talks are continuing on the sale of Houston-based Unichem International to
the Western Company of North America, which could raise up to Pounds 12m.
Discussions on property sales that could realise Pounds 10m were 'at an
advanced stage,' the group said.
Shares in the group fell by 10p to 128p - still more than double the price
when Mr Dixson was appointed.
An extraordinary meeting is scheduled for February 7 to seek approval for
borrowings of up to Pounds 175m, 'a limit the board considers to be
prudent.'
Without the increase, the group, which is still in discussions with its
lenders in both the US and the UK, would be unable to secure continued
financing.
Simon warned that in spite of 'a significant improvement' at the operating
level, it expects a small operating loss in the second half.
The pre-tax loss will also reflect a Pounds 90m write-down of goodwill
carried in the reserves, in addition to the Pounds 10.6m already written off
at half-way.
It also announced that it was making provision for expected losses on
disposals of Pounds 2.9m for 1994; a provision of Pounds 7.3m to cover the
early repayment of Dollars 125m of loan notes; and Pounds 1.5m above the
Pounds 6m made at the half-way stage for refinancing.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Crest Packaging static at Pounds 2.4m after
flotation costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough trading conditions and exceptional costs related to its flotation left
interim profits from Crest Packaging, the flexible packaging and cartons
group, flat at Pounds 2.43m, against Pounds 2.36m pro forma.
The shares, which were floated in November at 135p, fell 1p to 143p
yesterday.
Mr Rodney Webb, managing director, said the results were in line with
expectations.
Operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 2.54m) in the 26
weeks to October 30, on sales 7 per cent higher at Pounds 21.6m (Pounds
20.2m).
There were exceptional flotation charges of Pounds 525,000, partly offset by
a Pounds 400,000 release of provisions on site reorganisation. Interest
swung from payable of Pounds 181,000 to receivable of Pounds 330,000.
Flexible packaging increased market share with sales up 12 per cent to
Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 12.3m) in a flat market. Pressure on prices and
reorganisation costs left operating profits marginally lower at Pounds 1.82m
(Pounds 1.84m).
Cartons fared less well with turnover down 2 per cent to Pounds 7.72m
(Pounds 7.87m) and profits 26 per cent lower at Pounds 640,000 (Pounds
870,000). However, Mr Webb said the division had borne heavy overtime costs
on seasonal work for Christmas and Easter, which was not despatched to
customers until after the half-year end.
In November 1991 the group sold eight acres of its 18 acre site in
Gillingham, Kent, to Tesco for Pounds 21.3m, giving a net profit of Pounds
12.7m. In the half year Crest paid Pounds 3.7m tax on the sale and Pounds 1m
to Bowater, previous owner of the site.
With capital investment of Pounds 2.9m, there was a cash outflow of Pounds
7.3m. Net cash at the half year end was Pounds 10.4m, down from a pro-forma
Pounds 17.7m at April 30 last year.
The float costs boosted the tax rate, leaving earnings per share down at
3.63p (3.95p pro forma). Excluding the exceptionals, earnings rose 8 per
cent to 4.27p. There is no interim dividend but Crest intends to pay a final
in October.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Conversion costs leave Budgens lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budgens, the small food retailing chain 29.4 per cent owned by Rewe, the
private German food retailer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down Pounds
17,000 at Pounds 3.05m for the 28 weeks to November 7.
The figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 618,000 for the
conversion of nine Budgens stores into Penny Market outlets. In the
comparable period there were store closure costs of Pounds 250,000.
At the trading level, profits rose 10 per cent, from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds
4.56m.
The shares eased 1p to 41p.
Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said that 1993 had been a
difficult year for food retailing with margins under pressure throughout the
period. However, he was pleased that trading margins improved from 2.7 to
3.01 per cent in the six months.
Turnover slipped 1.6 per cent to Pounds 151.8m (Pounds 154.2m), though the
nine converted stores had been closed for an average four weeks each during
conversion.
In April, Rewe, which has a chain of 1,800 Penny-Markt discount food stores,
bought a 26.3 per cent stake from BIL Securities (Far East) for Pounds
23.5m. It has since raised its stake.
In October it underwrote the Pounds 30m issue of 5 per cent convertible
unsecured loan stock 2003, subscribing Pounds 28.9m to the issue. If Rewe
decides to convert at the first conversion date of September 1 1995, it will
raise its holding to 46.2 per cent of Budgens' equity.
The proceeds were used for expansion of the Penny Market chain. Mr von
Spreckelsen said there would be no more store conversions, only new
building. Some 40 in total are planned in the two years from last November.
Earnings were a same-again 1.5p per share, and the group has resumed the
payment of interim dividends with 0.3p this time.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gestetner sees red as exceptional Pounds
50m bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional charges of Pounds 50m sent Gestetner Holdings, the office and
photographic equipment distributor, into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.2m in
the year to October 31. This compared with profits of Pounds 27.1m last
time.
Most of the charges went on a restructuring programme flagged last May when
Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, took a 15 per cent
stake.
Mr Greg Melgaard, managing director, said the restructuring would involve
the loss of 600 jobs, mainly in Europe, reducing the workforce to just over
10,000. After twice failing to sell Vivitar, its US photographic
distributor, the group had decided to retain the business.
The group also said its margins were under pressure worldwide, with
principal markets in Europe continuing to suffer from recession. Sales
increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 1bn, but were only 1 per cent higher in
constant currency terms. Trading profits from continuing operations before
exceptional charges fell from Pounds 44m to Pounds 28.6m.
Mr David Thomson, who joined Gestetner as chairman from Rank Xerox in
August, said: 'Europe continues to suffer from the recession with only
modest growth expected during 1994. The global economic outlook remains
uncertain, but the outlook for North America and Latin America is more
optimistic and Asia offers opportunities for significant growth.'
Sales of office automation products rose by 3 per cent in constant currency
terms to Pounds 812m, but trading profits decreased from Pounds 51m to
Pounds 29m.
Losses per share were 17.5p, compared with earnings of 12.1p last time.
Before exceptionals, earnings fell to 5.8p (14.1p).
The final dividend is cut from 6.4p to 1.2p, leaving a total for the year of
3p (8.2p). The directors said the reduction reflected the need to strengthen
the balance sheet to support a recovery in the trading position through
1994.
Net debt increased from Pounds 94.7m to Pounds 128.9m, raising gearing from
36 per cent to 66 per cent. The group said a significant reduction in debt
was a management objective for the current year.
COMMENT
The new management is taking sensible steps to focus a previously
decentralised business and reduce its cost base, but is being forced to
grapple with tough conditions in Europe. Hanging on to Vivitar also
recognises brute necessity, since there is little point in disposing of a
profitable business for a paltry price. Forecast profits of up to Pounds 25m
put the shares, down 2p to 159p , on a prospective multiple of 15.8. Most
interest focuses on whether Inchcape will raise its stake to 26 per cent by
exercising an option on convertible loan stock at 172p per share by July 1.
It seem most likely Inchcape will pursue its strategic interest in the
group, which would help the share price. However, the shares are unlikely to
advance significantly until the new boardroom approach produces some solid
trading results.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: City Site Estates back in black with Pounds
349,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City Site Estates, the Glasgow-based property company, returned to the black
in the year to September 1993, its first profit since 1989, as a result of
profitable property sales and the absence of any further write-downs.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 349,000, compared with losses of Pounds
18.1m restated in accordance with FRS 3. The 1992 figures were held back by
Pounds 15.3m in property write-downs and a Pounds 3m write-off of goodwill
from an acquisition.
The company sold two properties during the year for Pounds 29m and reduced
net debt by Pounds 20m to Pounds 71m.
City Site recently put Hansard House, London, up for sale at Pounds 11.4m -
which would result in a book profit of close to Pounds 1m - and is looking
to reinvest the proceeds in other property deals.
Mr Louis Goodman, managing director, said 'we will be taking the company
forward in an aggressive manner'. Since September, City Site has signed
purchase agreements on Pounds 6m of properties in Scotland.
The company still has a deficit of Pounds 3.7m on its distributable
reserves, and is unable to pay dividends. It has applied to the Court of
Sessions to transfer Pounds 1.7m from its capital redemption reserve, and
with the continued appreciation in property valuations it is confident it
will start to repay deferred preference share dividends at the end of the
current fiscal year.
Rental income amounted to Pounds 9.93m (Pounds 11m) and operating profits
were sufficient to cover net interest payable of Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 9.7m).
Losses per share came through at 5p, against 120p.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Stirling chief leaves after 'disagreement'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman and chief executive of Stirling Group, the
clothing manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer, has abruptly left
the group.
His departure followed 'a disagreement over the direction of the import
division and his responsibilities within the group,' it said.
However, Mr Sheldon said yesterday: 'I do not believe the (group's)
statement represents the situation. The action happened so suddenly and
without warning, I need time to consider my position and to take further
advice.
'I do not differ with the board as to the direction the import division
should be taking.'
In the interim results to September 30, Stirling's profits fell to Pounds
223,000 (Pounds 1.37m), partly because of losses on the imports side.
The division was affected adversely by three factors: the acquisition of
Boftex, the UK importer with a Hong Kong-based sourcing operation, the loss
of a large shirt importing contract and larger than expected reorganisation
costs.
It is thought the board was united over recent decision to strengthen the
division by introducing new management. The board now believes that the
division should concentrate on its core customers, such as C&amp;A and Burton.
Mr Sheldon, 53, joined Stirling in April 1990, with a brief to sort out its
problems.
Mr Robert Coe, a non-executive director since 1989, has been appointed
non-executive chairman. Mr Steven Bentwood is to be group chief executive.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Analysts revise Kingfisher forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Kingfisher, the retailing group, fell 37p to 678p after the
company warned that trading conditions were still 'patchy', and announced
that total sales for the 24 weeks to January 15 were up 4 per cent.
After Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer which rushed out a
profits warning earlier this month, Kingfisher is the only leading retailer
to have issued what analysts called a 'disappointing' trading statement.
Analysts cut their profits forecasts for the full year from between Pounds
300m and Pounds 320m to about Pounds 290m to Pounds 300m.
Like-for-like sales, which exclude store openings and closures, were up 4.4
per cent at B&amp;Q, 3.9 per cent at Superdrug, and 3.3 per cent at Woolworth
over the same period. But sales were down 3.3 per cent at Comet, and 7.1 per
cent at Darty, France's biggest electrical chain which Kingfisher acquired
for a total of Pounds 1bn last February. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman,
said Comet, like Dixons, had suffered from the price war in the computer
games console market, but said that should not have come as a surprise.
'This is a perfectly normal pattern with high-growth fashion products of
this type,' he said.
Sir Geoffrey added that Darty had suffered from the French recession and he
suspected the recovery in France 'might be a bit later than we originally
thought a year ago'. He pointed out, however, that Darty's figures were 'not
dramatically out of line' with expectations.
He said operating margins were lower than the year before, but the fall had
been planned and was part of Kingfisher's strategy of investing in providing
better prices, range and service.
'You expect the investment has to come a bit ahead of the volume increase,'
he said. 'I am confident that value retailing is the best way forward for
Kingfisher.'

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Insurers report strong single premium
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued strong sales of single premium products over policies with annual
premiums were reflected in figures for new business in 1993 from two of the
UK's largest life companies.
Prudential Corporation said that within the UK its single premium sales had
risen by 24 per cent to Pounds 2.44bn (Pounds 1.97bn), while annual premium
sales fell by 12 per cent to Pounds 286m (Pounds 325m).
Within those totals there was an increase of 29 per cent in sales of single
premium individual pensions to Pounds 403m. Annual premium sales of
individual pensions fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 124m.
Meanwhile, Legal &amp; General said that UK single premium business rose to
Pounds 1bn (Pounds 736m). Annual premium business fell slightly to Pounds
142m (Pounds 143m).
The continuing interest in single premium products is seen as further
evidence that people are more reluctant than previously to make long-term
savings commitments, given the recent recession and economic uncertainties.
Both companies reported higher levels of business through independent
financial advisers, one of the distribution channels available to them,
along with direct sales forces and tied agents.
Prudential said that IFAs now accounted for more than one third of UK new
business, while for Legal &amp; General premium income from IFAs rose from 28
per cent to 34 per cent. L&amp;G highlighted in particular the growth of single
premium product sales through IFAs.
Prudential said the growth in its single premium life products came largely
from sales of the Prudence Bond, which amounted to just over Pounds 1bn.
Other life companies showed a different pattern of business.
Commercial Union said that its new UK life and pensions business in 1993
contained an increase in annual premiums of 12 per cent, taking them to
Pounds 63.1m, though its single premium new business fell by 31 per cent to
Pounds 295m.
It pointed out, however, that worldwide single premium business had reached
a record level in 1992.
Sun Alliance said similarly that while UK single premium new business was
Pounds 264m, compared with Pounds 562m in 1992, the 1992 level represented
an increase of just over 70 per cent on the previous year.
Its annual premium new business in the UK rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 82m.
Mr Trevor May, an analyst at BZW, said that the Prudential figures showed a
fall in annual premiums slightly worse than the market had been expecting.
Prudential shares closed down 12p at 364p.
London and Manchester reported an overall increase in single premium
business of 8 per cent to Pounds 238m, but annual premium business fell by
almost a quarter to Pounds 31.5m.
The group said that this fall reflected the restructuring which it had
completed in 1993.
Its shares fell by 23p to close at 413p.

FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gateway changes name to Somerfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gateway banner is to disappear from the UK's high streets, after the
grocery retailer said yesterday it was changing the name of its stores and
the group to Somerfield, and launching a Pounds 100m store refit programme.
At the same time, Mr David Simons, chief executive, said the group had
achieved a 12 per cent increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new
stores, for the four weeks to January 1.
He added that Gateway's sales since introducing its Price Check campaign of
price reductions last May had increased by 20 per cent.
Mr Simons said the name change was an important part of the programme to
revive the group's fortunes. 'We wanted to unify the business behind one
name,' he said.
The Somerfield name, already carried by 60 shops launched four years ago,
was chosen after trials involving eight modernised stores.
Four were badged Gateway, and four Somerfield, but Mr Simons said the latter
scored better in customer research. He believed the change would not cause
confusion, as Gateway shoppers would recognise the Somerfield name as that
used on its own-label products.
The company plans three store conversions a week for at least the next two
years. The refit cost is expected to be about Pounds 40 per sq ft - or more
than Pounds 300,000 for an 'average' store of 8,000 sq ft.
Gateway will spend another Pounds 100m over two years on introducing
scanning into all its stores, plus new systems to improve efficiency.
Mr Simons said the investment would be funded largely out of profits, and
was envisaged at last April's financial restructuring, when Gateway was
ringfenced from all but Pounds 500m of the Pounds 1.4m debt of its parent,
Isosceles.
'When we agreed the business plan with the banks it was understood that
investment would be required if the group was to prosper,' he said.
Gateway said it had seen double digit sales growth in the eight pilot
stores.
The refit includes a change in the external colour scheme to turquoise, blue
and red, new fittings and better signs.
Fresh food areas will be extended, and one innovation includes fitting
calculators on all shopping trolleys.
Existing Somerfield stores will not be changed. Mr Simons said it was
possible some Gateway stores might close in locations where there was more
than one, but the planned expansion of the group's 25 Food Giant discount
stores meant total floor space would remain little changed.

FT  21 JAN 94 / MGN in talks with founder of Independent newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Detailed negotiations are under way between Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr
Andreas Whittam-Smith, principal founder of The Independent and The
Independent on Sunday.
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, is interested in taking a
significant minority stake in Newspaper Publishing, which publishes The
Independent, but no agreement has been reached on how large the stake should
be or the precise terms.
Although the popular newspaper group has developed a good working
relationship with El Pais and La Repubblica, the main shareholders in
Newspaper Publishing, it is unlikely that a formal consortium can be put
together before next week.
MGN, whose share price has been rising and yesterday closed at 199p, is
looking for a long-term relationship with a trade investor.
For MGN, which does not want to get directly involved in running the
broadsheet titles, a condition of a deal would be that Mr Whittam-Smith, who
is seen to represent both the spirit and philosophy of the paper, should
remain as editor-in-chief.
Newspaper Publishing had pre-tax losses of around Pounds 486,000 on turnover
of Pounds 81m in the year to September, although losses are rising because
of promotional spending.
This year losses are heading for Pounds 8m, according to some estimates, and
even that assumes a cash injection of at least Pounds 15m.
It was being suggested last night that if the consortium did put a deal
together, it would amount to acting in concert and a bid might have to be
made for the entire company. Meanwhile Mr Tony O'Reilly, chief executive of
Heinz and chairman of Independent Newspapers in Ireland, is still seriously
interested in a large minority stake.
An indicative offer has been received by Mr Ian Hay Davison, the Newspaper
Publishing chairman, from Mr O'Reilly. The preliminary offer is in the
region of Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m for between 25 and 29.9 per cent of the
company.
It is believed that Mr O'Reilly, who would prefer a minority stake, is
prepared in certain circumstances to bid for the whole company.
He has long wanted the Independent group in Ireland to expand into the
national newspaper market in the UK.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Rich blames health for decision to quit BOC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Patrick Rich is to retire early as chairman of BOC, the industrial gases
group. He blamed health problems arising from 'the stresses and burdens of
office' for his decision, which takes effect in April.
The announcement came less than two months after Mr Rich gave up the job of
chief executive. BOC said yesterday that Mr Rich's health had been an issue
in that decision too.
Mr Rich became chief executive of BOC in January 1991 and chairman a year
later on the retirement of Mr Dick Giordano, the highest paid businessman in
the UK for much of the 1980s.
Unlike Mr Giordano, who remains a non-executive director, Mr Rich will be
retiring from the board entirely. BOC's board would 'decide soon' on his
replacement. Mr Rich, who is 62, had been expected to retire at 64.
BOC's annual meeting yesterday also heard that the company would make an
Pounds 85m provision for restructuring. Mr Pat Dyer, chief executive since
last month said this would 'produce savings of almost Pounds 60m a year'
within three years. BOC shares rose 32 1/2 p to 698p.
The restructuring is the result of a review of the company's businesses. BOC
said Pounds 25m would be allocated to reorganising the gases business, with
the balance going to healthcare.
The programme would cut 1,700 jobs, about 4 per cent of the workforce. Some
plant closures were possible as part of the action, which would be completed
by the end of 1995.
'The cost savings in gases will be around Pounds 8m in 1994 rising to Pounds
23m a year by 1996,' Mr Dyer said. 'The programme in health care will
produce cost savings of about Pounds 12m in 1994 rising to about Pounds 35m
in 1997.'
The cash would pay for closures, redundancies and new information
technology. Mr Dyer said that some would also go to 'improve the focus of
our product pipeline', which could mean stopping the development of some
less-promising products.
My Dyer told the annual meeting that current trading was 'in line with the
company's expectations'. There had been only limited signs of improvement in
the economic environment, with some growth in the Pacific region, except
Japan.
He confirmed that profits in the healthcare division were still being hurt
by low-price generic competition for the anaesthetic Forane, whose US
patents have expired.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Spring Ram launches Pounds 42m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Spring Ram rose 9p to 76p after the new management of the UK
kitchens and bathrooms group announced a Pounds 42.2m rights issue to take
advantage of trading opportunities.
The group also said that pre-tax losses for the year to January 1 would not
exceed Pounds 36.5m.
Proceeds of the 2-for-9 issue, priced at 53p, will eliminate Pounds 33m
debt. The deterioration in Spring Ram's balance sheet was one of the main
reasons for disgruntled institutional shareholders installing Mr Roger Regan
as chairman last summer. In September he forced the resignation of Mr Bill
Rooney, co-founder and chief executive of the Yorkshire company. After
accounting changes, Spring Ram's losses were Pounds 34.6m for the six months
to July 31.
Mr Regan said sales had grown in the second half of 1993 and he believed
economic activity was increasing in the group's markets. It was essential it
had working capital available to seize these opportunities.
The proceeds would also finance organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions in
the Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m range.
'Spring Ram has been through a difficult period in its history, during which
the group, its businesses, its management and its finances have all come
under intense scrutiny. Throughout this period, the principal businesses
have continued to demonstrate their strengths,' Mr Regan said. 'I believe
that it is important for investors, management and employees alike to be
able to draw a line under the events of the recent past and to focus on the
future.'
The pre-tax loss was mainly caused by the Pounds 30.2m provision announced
at the time of interim results. Mr Martin Towers, finance director, said
there would be no need for further provisions.
Group sales increased from Pounds 193.3m to Pounds 240m, but underlying
growth was about 10 per cent, excluding property development and Pounds 25m
of sales from Stag Furniture, bought at the end of 1992.
Mr Regan described as 'an appalling inheritance' the Regency Doors business
in the special products division, where operating losses increased from
Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 11.3m.
He said a new management team was now developing the recently created
business 'which lacked adequate operating systems, a suitably trained
workforce and an appropriate level of expertise in a number of key
management areas'.
There was a loss per share of 11p, compared with restated earnings of 3.6p.
The group paid a nominal final dividend of 0.1p, but forecast that the
dividend for the current year would be not less than 0.5p.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by NM Rothschild, with BZW
acting as brokers.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Banesto details restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank, yesterday
said that the funding needed to restore its balance sheet would be about a
third more than the amount estimated by the Bank of Spain three weeks ago.
The bank, which put the overvaluation of its assets at Pta675bn (Pounds 3bn)
compared with the central bank's figure of Pta503bn, also disclosed details
of a restructuring plan that would require substantial assistance from other
banks.
The plan, to be presented to the chairmen of the top five domestic banks and
the Bank of Spain next week, involves the other banks directly and
indirectly providing up to Pta350bn of financial support to restructure
Banesto. It would transfer all of its Pta245bn reserves into provisions, and
absorb a further Pta24bn of equity in provisions. This would reduce the
nominal value of individual shares from Pta700 to Pta500.
The plan also includes the acquisition of up to Pta200bn of its
non-performing loans by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, which is funded by
banks, and a Pta120-150bn capital increase, underwritten by a number of
banks.
Some Pta66bn which the Bank of Spain has estimated as the shortfall in
Banesto's pension fund would be written down. This was the intention of an
earlier plan proposed by Banesto's adviser, the US bank JP Morgan.
The plan no longer includes a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue that JP
Morgan had intended as the final plank of a previous capital raising
exercise.
Banesto's plan, which is weighted towards reassuring its shareholders, is
likely to be backed by the authorities who are concerned that a more
aggressive cut in the nominal share price would have a negative impact on
the markets.
Other banks are likely to contest the plan on the grounds that they will be
over-penalised for Banesto's mismanagement. Some banks believe Banesto may
be taking a deliberately pessimistic view of its assets.
Banesto's new management wants to keep the bank as an independent
institution. The main banks, Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Central Hispano (BCH),
Argentaria, Santander and Popular, are thought to be more more interested in
dismembering Banesto or in having one of their number take it over.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Aiming for a leaner fitter giant / Analysis of the challenge
facing Philippe Jaffre of Elf Aquitaine as France's largest industrial group
faces privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine is the giant of France's public sector. It is the country's
largest industrial company and its privatisation, launched yesterday, is the
biggest so far in the government's plans to sell corporate assets.
The sale of most of the state's 51 per cent stake in the oil group, which is
expected to raise about FFr35bn (Dollars 6bn), is an important test of
investors' demand for French privatisation issues.
Elf is one of the stars of the public sector, but its sale comes as the oil
price is languishing below Dollars 14 per barrel and after a year in which
profits fell from FFr6.2bn to just over FFr1bn.
The success of the issue will depend most directly on the price, which is
likely to be announced within the next few weeks. But it will also depend on
the strategy pursued by Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over at Elf Tower last
August. Since his arrival from Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, Mr
Jaffre has indicated grand objectives.
'In each of our core activities, in oil, chemicals and health, market by
market and product by product, we must be among the market leaders,' he said
at a press conference yesterday.
Privatisation will help. 'It will increase our flexibility and will make it
easier to raise financial resources.' He added that private sector status
would facilitate the formation of alliances with industrial partners.
Mr Jaffre's immediate objectives, however, are consolidation rather than
growth. The rapid expansion pursued by his predecessor, Mr Loik le
Floch-Prigent, which included the purchase of the North Sea assets of
Occidental of the US and a 30 per cent stake in Cepsa of Spain, strengthened
the group's position among the international oil groups. In the North Sea,
for example, Elf went from nowhere to become the fourth largest operator.
But the expansion has left Elf with borrowings of more than FFr40bn, gearing
of almost 50 per cent. Faced with this legacy, Mr Jaffre has given priority
to debt reduction and a concentration of resources on the group's core
activities. 'We have to consolidate our position and digest our
acquisitions,' he said yesterday.
This involves the sale of assets and the cutting of costs. Investments are
being scrutinised with respect to their profitability and strategic
importance.
First to fail the test was the company's fleet of three aircraft which was
sold on New Year's Eve. More significant will be the sale of a financial
holdings accumulated over the years. The disposals could represent between
one-quarter and one-third of Elf's FFr15bn of financial assets.
Exploration costs will also be cut. This year's budget has been trimmed by
about 10 per cent to FFr3.6bn. It means that the eastern dreams of Mr Le
Floch-Prigent, who launched ambitious projects in Kazakhstan and Russia, are
likely to take a back seat to the safer bets of the North Sea and the Gulf
of Guinea.
In exploration and production, as elsewhere, costs will be shared where
possible. Particularly pressing is the need to find a partner for Elf's east
German project. In its bid to acquire the service station network of Minol
in 1992, the French group agreed to rebuild an ageing refinery in Leuna in a
project with Thyssen of Germany. It was an expensive commitment, with a
total investment of about DM4.3bn (Dollars 2.5m), and one Elf would like to
share. Discussions with potential partners are underway, but no agreement
has been reached.
The new emphasis on financial rigour has its costs. The write-down of some
North Sea oil assets and provisions against financial investments were
important factors in last year's sharp fall in profits. But the bad news has
been cleared away and this year the benefits may start to show. Reduced
spending should combine with a stabilisation of demand and prices in the
chemicals industry to allow a recovery. The effects of the weak oil price
will be partly offset by the relative strength of the US dollar.
Mr Jaffre's approach, a reflection of his financial background, has also met
with measured approval from the investment community. 'Elf needs a financial
expert at the moment, not a reservoir engineer,' says one oil industry
analyst. He believes that Mr Jaffre's first steps are in the right
direction.
But so far they are only the first steps. Mr Bryan Jacoboski, managing
director of Paine Webber in New York argues that Elf needs further
restructuring, in particular to cut staff costs. 'Elf has one of the lowest
rates of profit per employee of all the oil majors,' says Mr Jacoboski.
Such comparisons are complicated by Elf's peculiar structure. No other oil
major has similar activities in pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals,
for example. But they do reflect a feeling in the industry that Elf has
moved more slowly on costs than rivals. Restructuring is likely to be
implemented without large-scale redundancies. 'Elf has never fired people
and there is no reason for that to change,' said Mr Jaffre. Job cuts are
likely to be achieved by voluntary measures.
'Its current cost base and its position in its principal markets mean there
is strong potential for a sustained rise in profits at Elf,' says one
industry analyst. 'The resources are there, now Mr Jaffre must exploit
them.'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Police pay likely to rise by up to 4.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's uniformed police are likely to secure a pay rise this year of as
much as 4.4 per cent despite the government's three-year freeze on public
sector pay bills which starts this spring.
The proposed increases are being budgeted for by the government. Talks have
been held between local authority employers and government officials,
although final approval for the exact size of the increases rests with Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary.
The size of the likely police pay rise is well above the inflation rate and
will be bound to infuriate public sector unions, which have rejected the
government's public sector pay freeze strategy announced last month by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, in his first unified Budget.
The actual pay increases police can expect will be based on data from the
government's Office of Manpower Economics. The recommendations will be
presented to Mr Howard by the independent Police Negotiating Board for
implementation in September.
Local authority employers have already been told that their budget
allocation for the next financial year is based on an assumption that they
will have to meet wage rises of at least 4 per cent for the uniformed ranks
and around 3 per cent for the rest of the staff in the police service.
The wage increases are to be funded from the overall government budget
allocation for the police. That will rise from Pounds 5.5bn in the present
financial year to Pounds 5.8bn in the next. At the same time, many councils
are concerned that they will be unable to make enough savings to meet the
2.4 per cent pay rise expected by teachers in April.

FT  21 JAN 94 / London and Dublin try to revive Northern Ireland peace
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Dublin last night tried to breathe new life into the Northern
Ireland peace initiative by addressing Sinn Fein's demand for clarification
of the Downing Street Declaration.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Albert Reynolds,
the Irish prime minister, used separate speeches to encourage support for
the joint statement agreed last month.
Republican leaders are insisting on clarification before making up their
minds on whether to embrace the peace process.
Their demand has been repeatedly rejected by London as an attempt to secure
further concessions - a stance reiterated by Sir Patrick yesterday afternoon
when he told MPs there was no justification for clarifying the joint
statement.
An apparent stalemate has resulted, with London vowing to intensify
political talks with Ulster's constitutional parties, aimed at restoring
devolved government to the province.
In last night's speech, Sir Patrick balanced a passage offering reassurance
to nationalists with a strong affirmation of the unionist veto over any
constitutional change in the province's status.
In his message to nationalists, Sir Patrick said the government would do
'everything in our power' to facilitate agreement.
Emphasising that 'no outcome is ruled out', Sir Patrick said the key was
'agreement between the people living in the island of Ireland, north and
south'.
He set out the ground that would be covered in exploratory dialogue between
London and Sinn Fein that would begin within three months of the IRA
renouncing violence, saying: 'That is where clarification could be
appropriate.'
He told unionists the government would uphold the democratic wish of 'a
greater number of the people of Northern Ireland' on whether they prefer to
support the union or a sovereign united Ireland.
Mr Reynolds sought to clarify Dublin's position on self-determination,
saying it was vital that doubts or confusions about the document should be
cleared up.
He said the island of Ireland and 'not just Northern Ireland' made up 'the
framework for self-determination'.
There were 'no short cuts' to the need for majority consent to change in
Northern Ireland. Those wanting unification 'should persuade those that do
not'. The end result of self-determination was not necessarily unification,
but rather 'any comprehensive settlement that would constitute an agreed
Ireland'.
In West Belfast, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams hinted to party workers
that if the right signals flowed from the declaration an IRA ceasefire could
not be ruled out. 'There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is
committed to ensuring the British government does not squander that
opportunity,' Mr Adams said.

<TEXT>
The British government yesterday sprang to the defence of Lord Owen, the
European Union's mediator for former Yugoslavia, after the European
Parliament passed an embarrassing vote of no confidence in the former UK
foreign secretary.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, issued a statement declaring full support
for Lord Owen.
'David Owen has not spared himself in the search for a peaceful settlement
in Bosnia. He has worked unremittingly and courageously to try to help bring
this about and he enjoys the full support of the British government,' Mr
Major said.
Lord Owen said yesterday he intended to stay on in his role in spite of the
resolution by Conservative and Liberal MEPs, passed in Strasbourg by a
narrow majority of 106 to 95, urging the EU to replace him.
He said it was an open secret that he wanted to quit the task, but had
agreed to help EU foreign ministers through the current crisis. Asked
whether he would now resign, Lord Owen said: 'There's no question of it.'
His role is not directly threatened by the MEPs' vote, since he was
unanimously appointed by member governments. However, there can be little
doubt that his credibility has taken a knock.
British Conservative and Labour MEPs failed in a rare show of unity to
defeat the resolution to find another mediator 'endowed with an appropriate
mandate and a new strategy for exercising it'.
MEPs appeared determined to express their dissatisfaction at Lord Owen's
failure to find a breakthrough in the latest Geneva talks, which broke down
on Wednesday, after nearly two years of inter-ethnic conflict in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, yesterday said he was launching
urgent contacts with France's European partners, the US and Russia to review
the situation in the light of the latest failure of the warring factions to
agree on a three-way division of Bosnia among its Serb, Moslem and Croatian
populations.
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said withdrawing the United Nations
Protection Force was one possible option, which is also being considered by
the British government.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is due to visit British forces in
Bosnia today to explore the choices facing the government, including a
pull-out at the end of the spring.
But officials in several western capitals warned that a withdrawal of UN
troops also entailed enormous risks. It would almost certainly lead to
bloodier fighting in Bosnia and could trigger a wider conflagration in the
Balkans.
Meanwhile, General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of France's rapid
reaction force, is being tipped as successor to General Jean Cot, head of
the UN Protection Force. Gen Cot ran foul of UN secretary-general Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali for publicly criticising his refusal to authorise air strikes.

FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cynics who believe shareholder activism involves much sound and fury but
little purposeful action should take a look at Spring Ram Corporation. Those
shareholders, led by the Prudential, which butted out the tottering
buildings material company's previous management must certainly be gratified
by its return to respectability. The new management has done a good job in
rationalising 3m sq ft of manufacturing space and imposing stricter
financial controls. Yesterday's Pounds 42m rights issue will further aid the
revival, plugging the holes created by its Pounds 37m annual loss and
providing the flexibility for expansion. The promise of bolt-on acquisitions
certainly strikes a confident tone so early in the recovery programme.
The market's reaction in pushing the shares up 13 per cent highlights the
hunger for recovery stocks, particularly in the favoured building materials
sector. But it takes an enormous amount on trust. Cautious shareholders
would have preferred to read the fine print of the annual accounts before
investing fresh funds. Putting the spring back into the company could also
prove a trickier task than the market seems to expect. Kitchen sales are
doing well but there remain big dents in the baths business. Some nasty
surprises could also emerge at Regency Doors, still suffering from its
'appalling inheritance'. At least Spring Ram now has a stronger balance
sheet against which to write off the business should the worst occur.

FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The creed of everyday low pricing has been preached at length by Sir Geoff
Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, over the past couple of years. Yet judging
by the company's Christmas trading performance, that particular road to
salvation is narrow and rocky. Marks and Spencer is clearly making a success
of cutting margins to gain market share and increase overall profits.
Kingfisher is making heavier weather of the exercise.
Those companies which have applied the formula in the US have not just
relied on price. They usually have a very strong market position, a
reputation for service, modern retail information systems networks and
high-tech distribution networks. M&amp;S fits this bill nicely, but Kingfisher's
chains lag in several important respects. In B&amp;Q, there are some signs that
everyday low pricing is working. But Comet struggles behind Dixons and
arguably the service element is lacking in both chains. Boots dominates
Superdrug's market to the extent that it is well placed to turn the screw of
lower margins against Superdrug. Woolworth is only now getting the
electronic point-of-sale equipment it needs.
In part, that may be a matter of timing, since Kingfisher has hired Mr Alan
Smith from M&amp;S to provide many of these skills. Kingfisher equally argues
that it has to start somewhere. Shareholders may find, however, that the
profits of the strategy are still some way off.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's disappointing sales figures from the Prudential are a downbeat
end to the season of new business announcements. Yet gloom has not been
spread evenly across the sector. Legal &amp; General announced a healthy rise in
new business on Wednesday, continuing its recovery from the dark days of the
early 1990s. Black Horse, the bancassurance arm of Lloyd's Abbey Life, also
fared well. This contrast in fortunes is partly a question of timing. While
L&amp;G was weeding its UK sales force two years ago, the Pru is only now
restructuring.
The slide in sales at Jackson National, the Prudential's US subsidiary, is
less easily explained away. If Jackson has been slow to match inducements
offered to savers by its rivals, the revamped products promised yesterday
might reverse the downward trend. But since low interest rates make
Jackson's bond-based annuities look less attractive, a more radical overhaul
of the product range may be required.
Savers in the UK will remain reluctant to enter into annual premium
contracts while recession lingers. The mis-selling of personal pensions
uncovered last year is likely to make them wary in this area too. Full
disclosure of commissions from next year will make the true costs of buying
life assurance clear. Having underperformed the market by 15 per cent since
commission disclosure was announced last summer, the sector has everything
to prove.

FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Guinness sheds its baggage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The elegance of the new cross shareholdings between Guinness and LVMH neatly
underlines the shortcomings of the previous structure. By exchanging its
indirect 24 per cent holding in LVMH for a direct 34 per cent stake in the
Moet Hennessy drinks operation, Guinness swaps an illiquid investment for a
tighter grip on the part of a business which interests it. That helps secure
the Guinness-MH joint ventures, which are central to the company's Far
Eastern ambitions. Guinness's pre-emption rights on MH shares will also
stand it in good stead if Mr Bernard Arnault, who controls LVMH, loses
interest in drinks. Meanwhile, the Pounds 416m of cash which Guinness will
receive usefully cuts the high capital commitment to the cross shareholding
and reduces its Pounds 1.8bn debt.
Part of the cost of these advantages comes in a 4 per cent dilution in
Guinness' earnings. That may dampen enthusiasm, especially given the
company's wary view of the year ahead. But it looks a small price for
disengagement from Mr Arnault's wider ambitions. Given that LVMH held the
upper hand in the relationship before the changes, one must also look to Mr
Arnault's motives in agreeing to a deal which suits Guinness quite so well.
The cash now lodged in LVMH may be the key, and a large acquisition may not
be far away.
Whether Guinness has made the right long term decision turns on the relative
prospects for upmarket drinks against luxury branded goods and whatever
other ideas Mr Arnault has. In the near term at least, the drinks market
will remain sober. The arguments for upmarket booze brands cascading through
developing countries also do not look as compelling as they did in the
gung-ho 1980s. But that portfolio may well be a more secure franchise than
the world of fancy luggage and media ambition.

Don't believe those stories about Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil taking his
eye off the ball. Although he has been doing his job for more than a decade
he remains very much a hands-on operator judging by a remark he made at a
conference on information highways yesterday.
Neil says he reads the proofs of his paper's weekly astrology column and
changes the predictions for people born under Gemini, his sign, if he
doesn't like the look of them. 'All Geminis are assured of a good future in
The Sunday Times,' joked Neil yesterday.
This would be quite amusing except for the fact that Neil was born on May 21
 -thus making him a Taurus, according to some astrological tables. Surely he
doesn't tamper with everybody's stars?

Anibal Cavaco Silva, the crisp economist turned Portuguese prime minister,
grudgingly opened a new school of journalism this week. 'I only read
newspapers for five minutes in the morning and five minutes in the
afternoon. Ninety-five per cent of what is written about me is untrue.'
Portugal's National Union of Journalists says it's thinking of suing him for
defamation. 'What would Cavaco Silva do if a newspaper printed a headline
proclaiming that 95 per cent of what he said was untrue?' asked Antonio
Matos, the union's president.
Cavaco Silva does not lack confidence; his most famous saying is: 'I never
have any doubts and only rarely make mistakes.' He's not happy with that
quote either. 'It has been printed a hundred times. But I never said it,' he
says - allegedly.

are in danger of being scooped by the public record office publishing under
the 30-year rule - would be Oldie founding editor Richard Ingrams himself.
He has just handed over the editorship to ex-Observer editor Donald Trelford

Jacques Attali, late of the European Bank for Reconstruction and

Buried in a book confusingly entitled Europe(s) lurks a most promising

insights into the Fall of Attali, the author continues: 'I know them (the
errors) better than anyone and will not dwell on them.'

Mark Goryachev, a St Petersburg deputy whose main claim to fame hitherto had
been for punching Vladimir Zhirinovsky in a canteen brawl, is planning a
second, more sophisticated, assault. One of Russia's new entrepreneurs and
true liberals, Goryachev is setting up a rival Liberal Democratic party that
might be more worthy of the LDP handle.
The neo-fascist party's disaffected regional workers are apparently a soft
target not because of the impracticability of delivering on December's
fantastic electoral promises - a husband for every single woman,
accommodation for the homeless, etc - but because their leader has failed to
dole out the expected ministerial posts and other sundry benefits.

Full marks to the trade mags for alerting the stock market to the chat going

Fewer marks for suggesting that Y&amp;R might gobble up the smaller agency. It's
much more likely to be GGT swallowing Y&amp;R's London outpost.
Y&amp;R, the world's biggest privately owned advertising agency, has been having
a bad time recently. Its London office has seen chief executives come and go
 -five in the last decade. The latest defections - of managing director Tim
Lindsay and chief executive Jerry Judge to Lowe Howard-Spink just before
Christmas - have brought matters to a head.
Of course, it would be a terrible loss of face if Y&amp;R were to be gobbled up
by GGT and it's still 50-50 whether a deal is struck. If it is, look forward
to yet another impossible advertising acronym: GGT-YR.

Chris Patten enjoyed his return to the parliamentary bosom yesterday. But
the governor of Hong Kong must have been dismayed by the lack of enthusiasm
from former colleagues for his 'let's negotiate' approach to China - which
has resulted in impasse.
On past performance the committee ought to have castigated him for not going
far enough in speeding democracy. Instead, he was asked why defiance was
better than settlement with Beijing on the best terms possible. What would
he do if Hong Kong legislators threw out his democracy proposals? Did he
really have support from the people?
On this point the man who, as Conservative party chairman, 'won' the last
election but lost his own seat, was able to exchange knowing smiles about
the value of opinion polls. As Tory committee member David Sumberg, elected
with a majority of 788, noted, if opinion polls had been correct neither of
them would yesterday have been sitting where they were.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Troops out, weapons in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, visits Bosnia today to see for
himself the situation of British troops serving there with the UN protection
force (Unprofor). Although officials insist that no decision has yet been
taken, it is no secret that both Britain and France are seriously
considering a withdrawal of their contingents in the spring, if by then
there is still no political solution in sight.
The collapse of the three-party peace talks in Geneva on Wednesday night
makes it even less likely than before that any political solution will
emerge from the present military stalemate. The Bosnian government, now
resigned to the effective partition of the country, is determined to fight
on rather than accept a territorial settlement which it rightly regards as
not only unjust but unworkable, and which it has every reason to believe the
Serbs would not honour even if they signed it.
The Bosnian Serb leaders, for their part, are happy to fight on rather than
give back the territory the government is demanding, which consists of areas
where there was a Moslem majority before the war. And the Croats, knowing
that any Moslem territorial gains are likely to be at their expense, have
now effectively switched sides.
Unable to end the war and unwilling to fight it, Britain and France are
rightly reluctant to keep their soldiers sitting indefinitely in the middle
of it. Indeed, there can be no justification for prolonging the danger and
humiliations to which the UN troops are constantly exposed. Although they
have undoubtedly saved many individual lives, they are unable to carry out
the mandate given them by the Security Council, and as a result they have
incurred the anger of the victims as well as the aggressors.
Achieving little
The force was sent in to ensure the delivery of relief supplies to
beleaguered civilian populations. The logic of deploying armed men for this
purpose was that without the use of force the supplies would not get
through. Since in practice force is not being used, the troops are achieving
little that unarmed relief workers could not.
But if they are to leave, their departure must not mean that the world is
finally abandoning Bosnia to its fate. The message to the Bosnians must not
be, 'you are all equally impossible, and we are leaving you to fight it
out'. On the contrary, the reason for pulling Unprofor out should be that it
symbolises a neutrality which is at odds with all official pronouncements on
the conflict, and indeed with many other acts of the UN, including notably
the economic sanctions against Serbia.
Beyond recall
The presence of UN forces has frequently been used as an argument against
giving effective military assistance to the Bosnian government, since it has
been argued that to do so would endanger the lives of UN troops. Once the
troops are out, that argument will have to be dropped. Their removal should
be accompanied by a clear statement to the effect that the Serbs and Croats
are held responsible for the lack of a peace settlement, and that from now
on the western powers are determined to help the Bosnian government, not
alas to restore the integrity of prewar multiracial Bosnia, which is
shattered beyond recall, but to gain control of sufficient territory to
build a viable Moslem state, either by reconquest or by achieving a stronger
negotiating position.
Western powers are clearly unwilling to engage their own ground forces in
this combat. But they can, if they so choose, ensure that the Bosnian
government forces are far better equipped for it than they now are, and they
can provide them with devastating support from the air. If they showed
willingness to do so they would acquire much greater leverage over the
parties. The Bosnian government would have a strong incentive to avoid
atrocities which might alienate western public opinion, and to listen to
western advice in future negotiations. The Croats would have a strong
incentive to return to their alliance with the government, in order to avoid
being treated as enemies rather than as allies by the west. And the Serbs
would have much more compelling reasons than at present to seek an end to
the war through a genuine compromise.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Russia's new government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin insists that the new government
'will not retreat from the course of continuing and deepening reform'. These
remarks come under the heading of disinformation, which is what Mr Clinton
embraced during his visit to Moscow last week. Coherent reform is not what
the new government will provide. Nor will it supply coherent reaction. It
offers the middle course of chaos.
The only reformist in a prominent position will be Anatoly Chubais, deputy
prime minister in charge of privatisation. An isolated reformer in a
government dominated by bosses from the military-industrial complex, he is
unlikely to achieve much. Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov are both gone.
Securely in place, however, are such old apparatchiks as first deputy prime
minister, Oleg Soskovets, and central bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko,
not to mention the prime minister.
These are far from the worst people available. They are not militant
xenophobes, for example. But they lack any coherent programme. At best, they
will manage decay. At worst, they will bring inflationary disaster. Mr
Yeltsin may have dissolved the old parliament, but he has adopted its
policies. Meanwhile, outright reactionaries wait in the wings.
The old Soviet Union based its system of governance on force and fraud.
Deprived of force, the new government intends to fall back on fraud. Leaders
of a country whose currency has lost 90 per cent of its value in the past
year say that lower inflation is no priority. It is showing that intention
by letting two men with reputations in the west, Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov,
depart. No wonder the rouble is plummeting on the foreign exchanges.
Hyperinflation is looming.
Gangsters' fortunes
Hyperinflation is what Mr Zhirinovsky and his ilk must be praying for.
Normal economic life, let alone the rapid expansion of socially efficient
new business, would be impossible. Ordinary people on fixed incomes would
starve. Traders, speculators and gangsters would make fortunes. The
government would be driven to introduce comprehensive price controls. Queues
would stretch around every block, and traders, gangsters, minorities, the
government and the president would all bear the blame for the chaos.
Serious reformers have lost this battle and may have lost the war. Their
only hope is to oppose, explaining to the Russian people why credit
expansion will bring not the increases in output promised by Mr
Gerashchenko, but the inflation they detest. Unfortunately, they have been
sabotaged in this even by supposed western friends. It has been painful to
hear Strobe Talbot and Albert Gore, for example, mouth ignorant criticisms
of Russia's alleged shock therapy. Anyone who believes that Russia's economy
suffers from that, rather than the opposite, knows nothing of events over
the past eight years and little of experience elsewhere either.
Possible collapse
Now the west will have to tell the Russian president why it cannot support
the programme on offer. It will have to work out its response to a possible
collapse of Mr Yeltsin's power. Last but not least, the west must learn from
its mistakes.
Maybe, though only maybe, there will be another chance. The west must then
have in place an organisation with the skills and the money needed to engage
seriously with a reforming government. The purpose of the money would, above
all, be to finance the budget without reliance on the printing press.
Some in the west will respond that the money is either unavailable or would
make no difference. Both replies are silly. The sums required are a small
fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent every year, for
decades, on defence against the former Soviet Union. Money would also show
the Russian people that the west does care, that it backs the reformers in
deeds, as well as words, and that it wants to alleviate their arduous
transition.
The failure of western leaders to engage seriously with Russian reformers on
the grounds that it would either be too costly or too difficult was a
mistake that could well prove a tragedy. Penny wise, but pound foolish,
leaders of the west may have committed a mistake comparable to the
Versailles treaty.

FT  21 JAN 94 / A successful blend: The benefits of the joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness's joint ventures with LVMH - now established in 13 countries - have
played a significant role in the rise of the two companies to leading
positions in the international drinks market.
Their success rests on two essentials: a strong portfolio of brands,
especially Scotch whisky and cognac, and an efficient and extensive
distribution network.
When Guinness took over drinks group Distillers Company in 1986, it acquired
a portfolio that included Johnnie Walker, the world's best-selling Scotch,
and Gordon's, the leading international gin.
It also acquired a fragmented international distribution system. Only a
quarter of the network was directly owned; the rest was in the hands of more
than 1,300 agents.
The task facing Sir Anthony Tennant, then the newly appointed chief
executive (now retired), was to broaden the brands portfolio to bring in
other categories of drinks, to improve control of distribution - and to do
it quickly if Guinness was to compete with other international drinks
groups.
An alliance with LVMH offered a ready solution, and one that had obvious
benefits for the French company as well as for Guinness.
LVMH owned the world's number one cognac, Hennessy, and leading champagne
brands, Moet Chandon and Veuve Clicquot; and it had a strong distribution
network, particularly in the Far East.
The combination of the Guinness and LVMH brands created a more marketable
portfolio of drinks and improved the two groups' competitive position at a
stroke.
Mr Tony Greener, the Guinness chairman and chief executive whom Sir Anthony
originally brought from luxury goods group Dunhill in 1987 to manage the
spirits business, said: 'Joint ventures are a commonsense way of going
forward. From a commercial point of view, they are very good value. With
carefully chosen partners, you can achieve all the synergistic benefits that
you get from a takeover without the high costs.'
Guinness has since gone on to strengthen its hand through joint ventures
with other drinks companies - Boutari in Greece and Bundaberg in Australia -
and takeovers, such as Asbach in Germany and Pampero in Venezuela.
But the alliance with LVMH has been gradually built up over the past seven
years. It now comprises 17 joint ventures and is the dominant Guinness
trading relationship, contributing 25 per cent of the Pounds 769m profits of
United Distillers, its spirits business, in 1992.
'With Moet Hennessy,' Mr Greener said, 'we share a belief in the importance
of brands and brand development. That underpins everything we are doing.'
The Scotch whisky and cognac portfolio has proved especially appealing to
consumers in Japan and Hong Kong, and in the developing markets of Malaysia,
Taiwan and Thailand. Late last year, a joint venture was established in
China, where international sales currently account for only 1.4 per cent of
the spirits market. 'China could be a 20m-case annual market for premium
imported spirits by the next century,' Mr Greener said.
The alliance is about to set up a joint operation in Korea, another
potentially significant market, and is exploring possible moves into other
parts of the world.
Yesterday's agreement focuses the partnership more closely on the future
development of their international drinks businesses.
Mr Greener, assured by the deal that he can prevent the Moet Hennessy brands
ever falling into a competitor's hands, said: 'We can contribute our help,
support and experience to their strategy and management, as partners with
common interests and common goals to build their brands and expand their
business.' With many world markets hit by recession, the two companies have
to seize whatever advantages they can find.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Heady cocktail with lots of fizz / Unravelling the complex
deal between Guinness and LVMH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By TONY JACKSON and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When yesterday's deal was an-nounced between the UK drinks giant Guinness
and LVMH of France, the world's biggest luxury goods company, Guinness
shares jumped 11 per cent and LVMH's fell 3.4 per cent. The deal, which
involves sweeping changes in the cross-holdings between the two companies,
is of authentically Gallic complexity. Peering through the fog, however, the
markets evidently reckon Guinness has the best of it.
It seems hard not to agree. For the past five years, the two companies have
had matching holdings in each other, amounting latterly to 24 per cent
apiece. At the outset, this was thought necessary to safeguard the network
of joint ventures in wines and spirits the two were building around the
globe. Latterly, the arrangement has become a distinct headache, for
Guinness in particular.
The trouble is that LVMH falls into two distinct halves: the Moet Hennessy
drinks business, which owns a distinguished clutch of champagnes and
cognacs, and the luxury goods side consisting of upmarket luggage and
perfume. It never made sense for Guinness - a pure drinks company - to tie
up cash as a passive shareholder in such a sprawling entity, save out of
necessity.
In addition, LVMH's boss, Mr Bernard Arnault, has shown signs lately of
being more interested in luxury goods than drinks, and indeed of branching
out into other areas such as newspapers. As a result, Guinness chairman Mr
Tony Greener conceded yesterday, Guinness shareholders have been getting
restive.
'It was clear that the existing arrangement did not make sense to Guinness
shareholders,' he said. 'Guinness and LVMH are quite separate companies,
with different strategic agendas. I'm not in any way denigrating perfume and
luggage. They're wonderful businesses. They just don't happen to fit our
long-term agenda.'
Guinness is therefore swapping its 24 per cent stake in the whole of LVMH
for 34 per cent of Moet Hennessy, plus Pounds 416m in cash. This has several
distinct advantages. Under French law, any holding above 33.3 per cent
carries certain blocking rights. Guinness will have the right of first
refusal to buy LVMH's main drinks brands, such as Moet &amp; Chandon champagne
and Hennessy cognac. It will also have two directors on the Moet Hennessy
board.
The present arrangement is such an improvement that one wonders what was the
point of the old one. Mr Greener - who took over as chairman at the start of
last year - was at pains yesterday to justify the strategy of his
predecessor, Sir Anthony Tennant.
Five years ago, LVMH was the product of recent merger between Moet Hennessy
and the Louis Vuitton luggage business. Mr Arnault had yet to appear on the
scene, and the bosses of the two halves, Mr Alain Chevalier and Mr Henri
Recamier, were at each other's throats. Guinness had already formed
important joint ventures in drinks with LVMH, and the instability of the
situation was plainly alarming.
'Anthony Tennant did the deal which was do-able and on the table,' Mr
Greener said yesterday. 'In 1988-89, there was a real danger that LVMH would
be broken up. There was a clear possibility that M Recamier would take the
luggage side and sell off the wines and spirits. Who knows who might have
ended up with them? It might very well have been one of our major
competitors. That would have destroyed our joint ventures.'
In addition, for Guinness to emerge suddenly as part-owner of brands as
famous, as quintessentially French as Veuve Cliquot champagne or Hine cognac
might have been a shock to Gallic sensibilities. One of the Guinness
advisers said yesterday: 'I don't know if it's appreciated in London that
the ability of a British company to get a direct holding in French brands of
this quality is very rare.'
Now, by contrast, Guinness has its money in precisely the bits of LVMH which
suit it, and is locked into its all-important joint ventures still more
tightly. At the same time, it collects Pounds 416m in cash, reducing its net
debt from Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 1.4bn and its balance sheet gearing - the
ratio of debt to shareholders' funds - from a slightly demanding 47 per cent
to 37 per cent.
Whatever Guinness proposes to do with the money, it will not raise its stake
in Moet Hennessy further. Mr Greener said: 'We are not trying to achieve
control of Moet Hennessy. It is a French company, with family origins and
ongoing family ties, and better suited to being run by its existing
management.'
Given Moet Hennessy's recent recession-battered profits record, Guinness
shareholders might be relieved to hear it. But Mr Greener was sanguine
yesterday on that point as well. 'We are switching into Moet Hennessy at an
interesting point in the economic cycle worldwide, with the potential of a
recovery in cognac sales in Japan and the champagne cycle turning positive.'
Across the Channel, the picture is much more complex and a good deal less
cheerful. As the accompanying diagram shows, Mr Arnault's empire has a
typically French 'cascade' structure. In essence, yesterday's deal proposes
that LVMH itself will receive a cash injection of some Pounds 1.3bn, while
the parts of the empire further up the cascade will foot the bill.
This works as follows. Guinness owns not LVMH equity, but shares in
companies further up: Jacques Rober (a holding company formed for the
purpose of the original deal) and the publicly quoted Christian Dior. These
shares will be sold by Guinness for Pounds 1.323bn to different parts of the
Arnault empire, but not to LVMH itself.
At the same time, Guinness pays LVMH Pounds 902m for its stake in Moet
Hennessy. Also, at some time between now and next summer LVMH has undertaken
to sell at least 4 per cent of its Guinness holding, which at yesterday's
price would fetch about Pounds 400m more. Thus LVMH ends up with a massive
reduction in net debt - from an estimated FFr15bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to FFr4bn,
according to industry observers.
The money will also come in handy for expanding LVMH's activities in luxury
goods, which already include perfume brands such as Givenchy, Louis Vuitton
luggage and the various champagne and cognac brands. 'There will be
opportunities in areas like cosmetics, fashion, luxury goods outlets or
leatherware,' Mr Arnault said.
But Mr Arnault played down further expansion in the depressed newspaper
industry. The acquisition last year of the business dailies La Tribune and
L'Agefi had been made for 'a modest sum' and 'had brought good results',
said Mr Arnault. A substantial acquisition in the sector, however, such as
Le Figaro, owned by Mr Robert Hersant, did not appear likely.
More certain is the boost that yesterday's deals give Mr Arnault in
strengthening his grip on his complex web of companies. 'Guinness's
departure from Jacques Rober means that it is removed as a significant
counterweight at the holding company level,' said Mr Piers Butler at Smith
New Court, the broker.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Arnault's shareholders are unhappy. The LVMH share price
initially fell some 7 per cent yesterday. It then recovered half that,
doubtless because of Mr Arnault's assurances that he is not turning into a
press baron, plus the fact that, after all, it is LVMH that gets the cash.
The real loser is Christian Dior, which will pay out FFr8.65bn to buy the
bulk of the Guinness stake in Jacques Rober. It seems quite likely that Dior
will have to ask its shareholders for cash to finance this. Dior's share
price fell 7.7 per cent yesterday.
Au Bon Marche, which will buy the 16.8 per cent in Dior held by Guinness,
will pay FFr1.7bn (Pounds 190m), to be financed by debt. Finally, SEPB, Mr
Arnault's non-quoted family company, will buy the remaining 6.65 per cent in
Jacques Rober held by Guinness for FFr1.5bn. This all adds up to a shifting
of debt around the group, a filling of LVMH's war chest, possible share
dilution and bad news for Dior shareholders.
Or so it seems at present. But these are early days in a complex game of
chess. As one London drinks analyst mused yesterday: 'Before today, you
would have said LVMH held all the cards. So what are we missing?'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Lords to the rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thank heavens for the House of Lords. We who would prefer the second chamber
to be an elected senate cannot be comfortable with such a sentiment, but
there is no escape. The ermined posse has cantered to our rescue, and not
before time.
Let me explain. The government, which falls short of perfection, is
confronted by an ineffective opposition. When ministers misuse their powers,
or attempt to take too much upon themselves - which believe it or not they
do - the ordinary citizen is helpless. There is no recourse to the courts or
a basic law, as in Germany. The checks and balances do not exist.
One solution, as we have seen over the past year, is a strong, brash,
intrusive and angry media. This is regrettable. Newspapers and TV, elected
by no one, were not placed on earth to weaken the government or thwart its
proposed legislation, or decide who shall and who shall not serve in the
administration. Our trade is to report, analyse and comment. The House of
Commons should be responsible for the rest. The lower house's failure to do
its job has created a vacuum, which has drawn in the fearsome tribe of
scribblers and questioners that has so damaged the Conservatives.
The House of Lords has likewise been sucked in. It, too, was elected by no
one, but it does contain individuals who from time to time pursue the noble
aim of safeguarding fundamental principles, without thought of party or
personal advantage. In this the upper house is possibly more blessed than
the media. Graced by Lord Whitelaw, it is triply blessed. It is no
coincidence that the deterioration in the quality of the Conservative
government first elected in 1979 dates from 1988, when the affable gentleman
universally known as 'Willie' stepped down. His role was that of purveyor of
prudence and wisdom to the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher; without him at her
ear, her fate was sealed.
On Tuesday Lord Whitelaw challenged certain clauses in the police and
magistrate's courts bill. The new law would give the home secretary, Mr
Michael Howard, the power to nominate chairmen of police authorities. 'I ask
him please to explain the reason for this major change in the whole history
of policing in this country,' said the former home secretary, now dignified
with the title of Viscount. The answer is that after the 1992 election yet
another Tory home secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, proposed to pack police
authorities with his nominees. If memory serves, half were to be party
placemen and women. This was watered down to a third, plus the appointee to
the chair. Mr Howard had doubts from the start. The government's ambition to
grab control from local authorities remains undiminished, or did so until
Lord Whitelaw's powerful intervention.
As originally conceived, the bill would have taken us a step towards a
national police force, something the English know in their bones should be
avoided. Other clauses in current Home Office bills, notably the proposed
removal of the accused's 'right of silence' in court, and the extension of
management-mania to the running of magistrate's courts have been criticised
by the Lord Chief Justice. He may get less attention than Lord Whitelaw,
whose political strength is far greater, but the process is the same. The
upper house is attempting to guard our civil liberties.
Lord Whitelaw made one other point. 'A bill for the police,' he said, '. . .
should command broad all-party support when it leaves Parliament . . .' In
earlier, more decorous times, this would not have needed saying. Today the
Conservatives are desperately afraid of Labour's successful assault on the
traditional Tory lead on policies to reduce crime. A consensus approach may
be beyond the imagination of the government. It is still tending the old
Thatcherite machinery, churning out quangos by the score, chanting nonsense
about efficiency, reading but failing to comprehend the manual left behind
in the 1980s.
The House of Lords could do us another service. It could train its sights on
the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill. Make no mistake. Deregulation is
highly desirable. Not one single unnecessary rule should be left standing.
Indeed, the government's boast about a bonfire of controls would carry more
conviction if more substantial material was to be fed to the flames than the
easy twiglets and grass cuttings listed in Mr Michael Heseltine's glossy
brochure. The trade and industry secretary is doubtless proceeding gingerly,
as might have been expected, but his first offerings are pretty timid.
That said, the government is going about it the wrong way. It aims to give
its ministers powers to do anything they please with existing regulations,
on the ground that to ask Parliament to amend or repeal previous laws would
be time-consuming and cumbersome. Would it really? The number of days the
Commons sits varies with every session. It was 244 in 1979-80 and 160 in
1990-91. Better use of parliamentary hours has been suggested by many who
have studied the timetable.
If you reject that excuse for giving every minister the power to make law,
try this one: before issuing an order the minister must consult 'such
organisations as appear to him to be representative of interests
substantially affected by his proposals . . .' In other words, he may choose
to take lunch with the Burst-into-flame Furniture Manufacturers Association,
but not the Keep Children Protected from Fire pressure group. To be fair,
the bill provides for a 40-day delay before orders laid before Parliament
can be confirmed by affirmative resolution. Parliamentary committees might
exam-ine orders during that period, although the mechanism for this is not
yet established.
The Lords can hardly reject the entire bill. They could, however, improve
it. As one example of many possible amendments, they could take out the
words 'appear to him', which I have italicised above, thus making it easier
for ignored groups to sue. They could insist on a predefined mechanism for
public scrutiny, such as a special standing deregulation committee or,
better, an independent body to represent the public interest as against
those of business associations. If the one opposition - the Lords - keeps
the spotlight on ministers who may misuse their new deregulatory powers, the
other unelected opposition - the media - will do the rest.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Credit where it's due for Clinton
trade proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARRY L FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Mr Clinton's trade agenda' (January 14), criticises the
US for remaining in the unilateral camp rather than the multilateral camp.
It is true he has proposed that competition policy, trade-related
environmental issues and workers' rights should be on the future agenda for
world trade negotiations.
While you endorse the idea of competition policy for a future agenda, you
make much of the point that neither workers' rights nor environmental issues
are clearly desirable trade subjects. However, you do not mention that Mr
Clinton's proposals are for the new World Trade Organisation agenda, which
comes into being on July 1 1995. That group can sort out the issues for the
agenda.
Mr Clinton ought be given credit for raising these subjects now for truly
multilateral consideration. In the US we are patiently waiting for the
European Union's ideas on subjects for future trade negotiations. The
seven-year Uruguay Round, while successful, dealt primarily with issues from
the 1970s and 1980s. It's catch-up time: we need to start addressing issues
of the 1990s.
The leader also criticises the long-standing US policy of trying to pry open
Japanese markets for all exporting countries, and suggests it be referred to
the WTO. No mention is made of the US goal - opening markets for all
exporters. Those efforts have gone on for years and a few years' delay so
that it can be raised in the WTO is simply not on when Japan continues to
run such a huge trade surplus against most of the rest of the world.
In discussing Mr Clinton's trade policy, no mention is made of his pledge to
Caribbean and Latin American countries to enter negotiations to ensure those
countries are not discriminated against by the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Nor is mention made of the Clinton administration's commitment to
negotiate a bilateral trade pact with Chile as a harbinger of future
liberalisation in many countries of Latin America.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Put freight on water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN VALDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Rail freight wins Pounds 43m aid package' (January 19)
announces increases in grants by the government to encourage companies to
switch freight from road to rail.
Under the same scheme, grants are also available for developments that will
enable freight traffic to be transferred from roads to the inland waterways.
Water transport is environmentally friendly and has the capacity to handle
far more than is presently carried. Canal-borne freight currently keeps
200,000, 20-tonne lorry loads off Britain's roads every year and British
Waterways, which runs the country's canals, is actively seeking
opportunities to increase freight carrying on waterways.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Curious lack of interest in European
law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Two points on your excellent editorial on the need to cut back on the
regulatory burdens of business ('First blood in the red tape war', January
20).
First, it is curious that there should be a furore in the UK over scrapping
regulations without a full debate in Parliament. Many regulations
implementing European Community directives were not debated in the house
beforehand.
I have been monitoring the way in which statutory instruments made under the
European Communities Act 1972 go through Parliament. The Public Services
Contracts Regulations 1993 which came into force on January 13 1994 were
made and laid on December 22 1993, as were the Utilities Supply and Works
Contracts (Amendment) Regulations - both while Parliament was in recess.
Both are concerned with the controversial public purchasing directives.
Second, your idea that there should be a 'new select or standing committee
for deregulation . . . to scrutinise ministerial proposals in detail' has
merit.
I would add that such a committee should also scrutinise proposals for new
regulations, especially those which give effect to EC directives. That might
help to avoid the over-implementation of things like the 'six-pack' of EC
health and safety directives about which the government is rightly
concerned.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No favourable treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MILES YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I do not wish to become involved in a public debate with the leader of
Camden Council (Letters, January 17), but Richard Arthur's claim that the
City of Westminster receives favourable treatment from the government must
be refuted. Mr Arthur should consider instead the possibility that it is
Westminster's efficient and business-like approach that sets our two
boroughs apart.
Since April, government support has reflected the taxable base of each
borough and, on that basis, Westminster's grant was less than that of most
other London boroughs - less even than Camden's. Despite this, we announced
a Band D tax of just Pounds 295 compared with Pounds 718 in Camden.
This reflected, among other things, Westminster's competitive tendering
programme, which saves Pounds 10m a year, while also improving standards
through enhanced contract specification. In addition, we have recently
streamlined the centre of our organisation enabling us to concentrate more
of our resources on front-line services.
These achievements, among many others like them, are the true 'Westminster
story'.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Too harsh a view of life insurance
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LAWRENCE HAWTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You cannot imagine how disappointed we were to read the editorial, 'An
end to foot-dragging' (January 12), concerning the life insurance industry,
and in particular the resignation of Jim Stretton from the Personal
Investment Authority board.
To nail our colours to the mast, we are firm supporters of long standing of
a single retail regulator. If the proposed constitution is too weighted
towards public interest to achieve that objective, then greater practitioner
in-volvement clearly is the answer.
The KPMG report to which you refer obliquely, does not disclose that sales
were made of personal pensions without proper advice. It only indicates that
there were shortfalls in file notes and therefore there was no evidence on
the files that certain actions had been carried out. Not one client nor one
adviser has been interviewed in the course of the KPMG report to establish
if any actual bad advice has been given.
You mention that 'undesirable - and far too widespread - selling practices
have been revealed'. Where? The life insurance industry delivers to its
policy holders Pounds 3.4m in benefits every hour of every day (1992 ABI
statistics). We have 10m policyholders and last year there were only 1,700
substantiated complaints handled by the ombudsman. The legal profession had
17,000 complaints and it is not taking the public berating that life
insurance salespeople are taking.
The Financial Times is well respected for researching its topics and
publishing the facts. I have to say in this instance that the Life Insurance
Association wishes to register its disquiet at the way you seem to suggest
that the industry has been tried and convicted and is only waiting for
sentence by a regulator yet to emerge.
You might well look at the possibility that a complex commercial and
regulatory situation is being exploited politically for ends we can only
guess at.
Finally, there have been accusations of mis-selling based on high surrender
values in recent years. However, a recent Times report interestingly
revealed government statistics that showed 28 per cent of the population
(15.7m) were unemployed over the two year period 1991-93.
I would ask you the question - is there a correlation between this statistic
and the level of surrender values?

FT  21 JAN 94 / An outsider looking in: Turkey's hopes for closer European
ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The joint visit to Ankara yesterday of Douglas Hurd and Klaus Kinkel,
foreign ministers of their respective countries, was an unprecedented
Anglo-German initiative.
It would be normal for either to visit Turkey alone or, in special
circumstances, for both to participate in a European Union mission. But the
latter would be formally led by the country occupying the presidency, which
since January 1 is Greece. In this case Greece was not only unrepresented,
but its absence was virtually the object of the exercise.
For different reasons both the UK and Germany see themselves as Turkey's
main friends and advocates within the EU; and even though British officials
insist no discourtesy to Greece is intended, both governments are anxious to
reassure the Turks that the six-month Greek presidency will not damage
EU-Turkish relations.
The Turks are delighted by the gesture, while Greece has denounced it as a
breach of the EU common foreign and security policy, supposedly in operation
since the Maastricht treaty came into force last November 1. The meeting
provides a potent reminder of the importance west European countries attach
to their relationship with Turkey - 'not a luxury but a necessity', Mr Hurd
said on Wednesday - and of their impatience with Greek efforts to block that
relationship in the hope of extorting Turkish concessions on Cyprus.
Greek-Turkish relations, seldom warm even before Turkey occupied two-fifths
of Cyprus and drove out the Greek-speaking population in 1974, have been
almost continuously tense since then. Their bilateral relations are also
envenomed by a long-running dispute about oil-exploration rights on the
continental shelf under the Aegean Sea - an issue which came close to
causing war in 1989, and which Greece now threatens to revive.
But in western Europe Turkey is increasingly seen as the political and
commercial hub of the eastern Mediterranean, as well as a potentially
stabilising influence in the Turkic-speaking republics of the former Soviet
Union. In Europe as in the US, Turkey is viewed as a regional power, a
secular democratic role model, and a buffer to Islamic expansion in the
Middle East.
Turkey, as one senior British official put it, is a 'trusted and valuable
interlocutor' in a range of trouble spots from the Balkans, to the Caucasus,
central Asia and the Middle East. But it may not stay that way, unless
Europe succeeds in complementing the defence aspects of the relationship
with stronger political and economic ties.
This month, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, visited
Athens and appealed to Greece to adopt a 'realistic and strategic view of
Turkey's importance'.
Turkey is already smarting at the way its application for EU membership has
been politely shelved since 1989 - while Efta countries, and perhaps even
former communist satellites in central and eastern Europe, are allowed to
jump the queue. The latter prospect, clearly flagged by last year's
Copenhagen summit, is especially galling to the Turks who feel their record
as solid Nato allies since the mid 1950s, and their support for the west in
the Gulf war, entitle them to expect better treatment.
Many of the reservations about Turkey's qualifications for EU membership
expressed by the Commission in 1989 still stand: the problems presented by
Turkey's large population; its heavy dependence on agriculture for
employment; and perhaps most emphatically, its less than creditable human
rights record. A recent debate in the British House of Lords, strongly
critical of Turkish policy towards its Kurdish minority, was a salutary
reminder for Turkish officials of the difficulty the country faces in
improving its image in the west.
The next few months will provide a significant test for both the EU and the
Turkish government in their efforts to keep Turkey's European ambitions on
track. Barring upsets, a customs union between Turkey and the EU is due to
start in 1995. This will be the biggest change in Turkey's trading
conditions since it signed an association treaty with the European Community
in 1963, and the country has embarked on an ambitious programme of economic,
social and political reforms aimed at bringing its institutions into line
with those of its European partners.
At the same time the Turks are eagerly seeking clarification of the offer of
associate membership of the Western European Union - the EU's defence arm
and 'European pillar' of Nato - made to them last year, which they have yet
to put to their parliament for ratification.
During his visit, Mr Hurd tried to define a comprehensive agenda, aimed at
transforming the EU Turkish relationship: completion of the customs union on
time, a more intensive political dialogue on issues covered by the EU's
common foreign and security policy, and a deepening of the defence
relationship - while at the same time Turkey has to push ahead with legal
and human rights reforms at home.
The UK is also urging Turkey to make renewed efforts to reach an early
solution of the Cyprus problem, stressing that this has been an obstacle to
improved relations, not just with Greece, but with Europe as a whole and
indeed the US. It will not be easy, since the Turkish Cypriot leader Mr Rauf
Denktas is attached to his independent status, while the Greek Cypriot
president, Mr Glafkos Clerides, elected last year, is on the whole less
flexible than his predecessor. The latest war of words would suggest there
is still some way to go to create a climate of confidence to resolve the
issue.
In addition, the Greeks have until now used their veto powers to block EU
financial assistance due to Turkey under the so-called fourth financial
protocol, and have refused to approve the 'Matutes package', a programme of
support for Turkey prepared in the wake of the Commission's negative opinion
on the Turkish application for full membership.
Turkey's foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, has already thrown down the
challenge to his European partners. 'It is not that Turkey is in need of the
money,' he says. 'The issue is whether the Union has the will to overcome
the veto of just one of its members.' Mr Hurd's and Mr Kinkel's visit may
have partly reassured him but, coming in a week when the Turkish lira
collapsed as several key economic indicators diverged further from the
European norm, it should also have served to demonstrate that Turkey's
problems with the EU are by no means all of Greek origin.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Brecht's fragmentary Fatzer Material - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fatzer, the hero of a play that Brecht neither published nor finished, is an
innocent non-conformist. Not that he is eccentric. Simply, he insists, 'I
can't go on doing what is fine for me and does harm to you'; and a choral
commentator remarks that he is not a 'mind-of-the-masses man'. Yes, an
archetypal Brecht hero; and his dissent links him to other such heroes of
German drama as Woyzeck. All around him you see society at its most brutish.
Evil flowers naturally; sex is an unfeeling and animal function; aggression
is everywhere.
After Brecht's death, the 'Fatzer' fragments were arranged into a montage by
the German playwright Heiner Muller, and now the Gate Theatre is presenting
them as translated and directed by Marc von Henning. The main impression
this version leaves, however, is not of content but style.
The play has seven performers. At any time in the action, two or three of
them are standing at lecterns on the periphery of the stage. They don
spectacles, and at regular intervals chant a kind of chorale that either
tells us what will happen or comments on what did happen. Sometimes their
text sounds Biblical, sometimes like a Greek chorus, sometimes in
word-cycles almost worthy of Gertrude Stein. But they chant it like Daleks.
Brechtian humanity is missing.
Meanwhile the scenes that occur in the centre of the stage show us society
reduced to its most empty. Men, when asked where they have come from, answer
'Wherever we've come from, think of it as Hell's backyard.' When one woman
says to another 'Have you no shame?', the other replies 'How would I know? I
haven't had it touched in years.' Everyone seems to be commenting on
themselves even while they are in the middle of things. Brechtian irony is
never absent. But the text keeps drawing attention to its own literary style
 -'I am to them a foot, no more,/ That dangles from its ankle, dead . . .' -
and the actors keep end-stopping in mid-sentence to show us how Brecht's
language consists of lines.
There are also expressionist effects that strike me as un-Brechtian. The set
is composed of barren earth. Early on, the two women are seen lying,
immobile and face down, on this earth; when they make efforts to rise, they
promptly fall back splat to the ground. This obvious metaphor, straight out
of the German movement theatre of such people as Pina Bausch - as are the
heeled shoes the women wear - is too leaden to succeed in Brecht, as are
several other heavy symbols.
Should Brechtian theatre be alienating to this degree? And should alienation
be this boring? For oh, this production keeps hitting you like a dull cosh -
for 90 minutes, with no interval. The seven actors belong to Primitive
Science, a company founded by von Henning last year and focusing on
20th-century European theatre. The production makes you feel less like a
theatregoer than a student.
At the Gate Theatre, W11.
Ends February 5.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Distant echoes of long lost civilisations - Susan
Moore admires the Ortiz antiquities currently on show at the Royal Academy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an age in which every businessman who makes the odd foray into Bond
Street or Park Avenue acquires the soubriquet 'collector', it is heartening
to discover the collection of George Ortiz.
The works of art on show at the Royal Academy in London - their first public
airing in the West - represent the cream of a collection that has been
singlemindedly amassed and honed over 44 years. Ortiz belongs to that all
but extinct breed of passionate, self-taught connoisseur-collectors
fortunate to have the means - his grandfather was Bolivian 'Tin King' Simon
Patino - to pursue his passion and the eye to utilise it. To say that he has
formed the world's finest antiquities collection in private hands is almost
to miss the point. Each piece speaks for itself.
You do not have to know anything about ancient civilisations to respond to
objects such as the commanding copper bust of the 12th Dynasty Pharoah
Amenemenhat III, the handful of tiny Babylonian haematite shell and frog
weights or the elegant curves of an Anatolian Bronze Age stag. George
Ortiz's response to art has always been instinctive and emotional. He learnt
by looking, by feeling, and then comparing.
For the unveiling of his collection of 282 exhibits from some 27 different
cultures, Ortiz has assumed the role of a team of curators and technicians.
He has not only selected and catalogued the exhibits, previously confined to
his home in Geneva, but supervised their packing and display down to the
design and exact dimension of each showcase. Rusty Culp and his assistant
have been flown in from the US to light the show; some Pounds 35,000 of new
equipment has been donated to the RA. From first glimpse, it is apparent
that this is no typical museum exhibition.
A number of exhibits are left free-standing, unencumbered by the barrier of
glass. Although ordered by chronology and region, the display favours
juxtapositions determined more by aesthetics than by any archaeological
purism. A lively bronze bowman from 7th century BC Crete stands before a
much earlier, probably Athenian krater painted with a centaur of startlingly
similar angular features. The comparison adds to our appreciation of both.
Elsewhere two Nuragic warriors from 9th-7th century BC Sardinia find
themselves locked in an accidental embrace, joined by a root that chose to
grow through them. In a museum the root would have been removed and the
figures separated. Most strikingly, each item is shown to its best advantage
and given the requisite space to speak with its own voice. These are
luxuries that overcrowded and underfunded museums cannot afford.
In return for lending 280 pieces from his collection - this exhibition in
effect - to the Hermitage and Pushkin museums, Ortiz was allowed the
privilege - and every museum curator's dream - of trawling museums across
the USSR to mount his own loan exhibition of ancient art from Eurasia. The
show was staged in Zurich and Kyoto last year. Unlike many museum curators,
he is also free to acquire antiquities that come without a provenance.
Greek art forms the bulk of the Ortiz collection, ranging from the Neolithic
to the Byzantine and from the Greek mainland to Sicily and beyond. Not to be
missed is the infinitely subtle marble torso that so assuredly marks the
transition from the stylised severity of the Archaic style to the naturalism
of the classical period. Or the glorious group of partially gilt silver
rhytons or drinking vessels that take the form of stag and doe's heads and
the twin-faced Janus.
But no less remarkable are the far less familiar survivors of more distant
civilisations. There is the monumental alabaster Sumerian bull-man from 3rd
millennium BC Umma, the spirited patinated bronze chariot fittings in the
guise of wild asses from Early Zhou dynasty China, the imposing Ghandara
head from present-day Pakistan believed to represent the Prince Siddhartha,
the first Buddha. The spiralling gold armlet from Bronze Age France is pure
sculpture.
It is the smaller pieces and figurines that more often beguile us with their
purity of form, line and expression. The best exude a vibrant human spirit
that breezes effortlessly across continents and millennia.
Art of the Ancient World continues at the Royal Academy of Arts, London W1,
until April 6.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Purcell's 'Dioclesian' - a rarity revived / Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 12 months to go until the long-awaited tercentenary of Henry Purcell's
death. The preliminary fanfares which started to be heard as early as two
years ago are now in a crescendo, as early music groups line up to go into
the recording studios so that their new Purcell records will be ready for
next year.
The latest rarity to be revived is Dioclesian, a semi-opera composed in
1690, originally blending play and music. In the light of current political
events its attitudes look most unfashionable. No opportunity is missed to
praise the ruling monarch, to 'sound his renown', to 'embalm his name'. Nor
is much time spent debating moral propriety. In the celebratory masque at
the end Bacchus and Cupid are the two immortal guests, promising 'days and
nights spent in delights'.
The plays which were intended to go with Purcell's semi-operas do not as a
rule add much to our understanding of the music. Roger Norrington recently
performed The Fairy Queen complete with the re-hashed version of A Midsummer
Night's Dream for which it was intended, but that is a special case. The
Shakespeare, even mutilated, retains its strength. When the other plays have
been unearthed, they have merely made the evenings very long indeed.
For their concert performance of Dioclesian at St John's, Smith Square,
Trevor Pinnock and The English Concert kept strictly to the music. No play,
no acting to talk of, no sets. (In Purcell's day the lavish transformation
scenes brought vistas of palaces and gardens descending from the ceiling.)
For present-day audiences this is probably the best way, though it would be
fascinating just once to lash out on a comparable staging for the
commemorative year.
Even if he did have to share the limelight with the dramatist, there is no
sign that Purcell gave the music anything less than his fullest attention.
Odd corners of the score are enlivened by a pride in detail. The picturesque
moments, including the Butterfly Dance, the Chair Dance, and the Canaries,
are drawn with skill and delight. With their recording imminent, Pinnock and
his players were rehearsed to top form, as was the exemplary Choir of the
English Concert.
Nancy Argenta and Ann Monoyios were the two soprano Wood-Gods, the latter
the more delicate, neatly turning her ornaments. Stephen Gadd makes an
impressive, firm Purcell bass, but was po-faced as the shepherd who sweeps
his shepherdess off her feet in the space of four stanzas. Some of the other
solo singing was on the dull side in music as fresh and alive as if it was
written yesterday - no doubt why the programme gave Purcell's dates as
1965-95.

<TEXT>
Britain's ice skating stars Torvill and Dean are in an almost impossible
position at the European Figure Skating Championships in Copenhagen which
are covered in Ice Skating (8.00 BBC1). There will be disappointment not
only if they fail to win but if they fail to repeat that clean-sweep of
sixes which they achieved with their 'Mack And Mabel' number at the same
venue in 1982. Today is the first time their new free dance routine will be
tested internationally.
There are several ways of dealing with nuisance phone callers. If you have
the chutzpah you can outdo them at their own game. Keeping a referee's
whistle by the phone and blowing it hard can also be effective. But our
favourite is to put the receiver down quietly on something soft and let the
nutters talk to themselves. Public Eye considers the problem (8.00 BBC2).
Further Abroad is a series that viewers either love or loathe. Jonathan
Meades is a presenter whose idiosyn-cratic style and attitudes I enjoy, but
cause some critics to howl in rage. Today he looks at golf courses (9.30
BBC2).

FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Stomp appeal - Post-punk, pre-grunge, Sophie Constanti
enjoys this troupe's industrial style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stomp is a troupe of DIY music makers; a sound and motion relay team of six
men and two women, all of whom have the tough, dusty, whitewash-spattered
appearance of building site labourers. As they wander onstage - coughing,
sniffing and shrugging - you almost expect them to start passing bricks and
planks to one another or to call for a tea break. But in the workmanlike
fashion which, it soon transpires, is an essential part of Stomp's heavy
handed, unadorned, industrial style (and a major element of their appeal),
they set about manipulating dustbins, brooms, rubber pipes, buckets,
newspapers and each other to create walls of sound which rise and cascade to
often thrilling effect.
Post-punk, pre-grunge and hellbent on discovering rhythmic possibilities in
the most simple, everyday actions and objects, Stomp's performers treat the
stage as workshop floor. Here they not only practice their trade, but engage
in the petty rivalries of the workplace - frustration, one-upmanship and
glee made visible by body language, facial expression or a single aural
response delivered with an acute sense of comic timing.
When the foreman, a cherubic, too clever by half wideboy character, is not
keeping an eye on his colleagues or leading them in a militant tap dance, he
is challenging the audience with a repeat-after-me series of clapping
rhythms, making participation seem like an activity charged with fun rather
than embarrassment. Other members of the cast devote most of their energy to
the total physical theatre of noise-making: they use knotted rags to thrash
at the shallow pools of water on top of an arrangement of oil drums;
standing in tea chests, they hulk across the stage, gasping furiously with
each burst of effort; harnessed to the facade of the show's junk-laden
scaffolding tower, they swing from side to side, beating a selection of
items to mimic the delicate chimes and hypnotic spectacle of figures on a
huge, decorative, outdoor clock.
The muscular strain involved is unconcealed, even celebrated; a brute
strength which colours and defines Stomp's brand of disciplined, humorous
yobbery but is frequently interrupted by more subtle assertions of power,
authority and wilful non-co-operation. A thumbs-up, a look of disdain,
refusing to play the game or initiating one's own amusement and excluding
everyone else - these are the quiet, personalised moments of a show which
relies heavily on team effort.
Anyone who derives pleasure from rummaging through skips full of useless
junk, or is convinced that every scrap of rusting metal and piece of
splintered wood is potentially recyclable will love Stomp. So will anyone
who has tried to find light entertainment in the most mundane of household
chores. After watching Stomp in their Socialist Worker meets Fred Astaire
opener - all swishing brooms and dancing feet encased in Blundstone boots -
or in their washing the dishes routine in which four men, each wearing a
kitchen sink unit in the way that a cinema usherette wears her box of ice
creams, plunge their rubber-gloved hands into soapy water for a droll,
anarchic, scrub and rinse ballet, you might even start to believe that the
task of removing stains on the carpet can be turned into a domestic artform.
At Sadler's Wells until February 5

FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Testing the purity of fruit juice - Worth
Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A technique developed at the University of Nantes, in France, to certify the
authenticity of French wine, is now being used to determine whether fruit
juices are as pure as their labels assert.
The Snif-NMR technique (site specific natural isotope fractionation by
nuclear magnetic resonance) determines whether sugars in the juice come from
fruit or sources such as sugar beet or cane.
Eurofins, the Nantes-based company which carries out the process, ferments
the sugar into alcohol. Magnetic resonance is then used to determine the
overall ratio of hydrogen and deuterium, the heavy hydrogen isotope, in the
alcohol. The ratio varies according to the type of sugar.
The process also identifies where the carbon atoms in the alcohol are sited,
a further indicator of the purity of the orange, apple, grapefruit or
pineapple juice. Eurofins: France, 40 59 45 71; UK, 0981 251602.

<TEXT>
Zeneca, the UK bioscience company, has found an astonishingly simple way of
inserting new genes into plants, writes Clive Cookson. It uses microscopic
needle-shaped crystals of silicon carbide, known as whiskers, to punch holes
into plant cells through which foreign DNA can enter.
The researcher just shakes a test tube full of water, whiskers, DNA and
cells for a few seconds with an ordinary laboratory mixer. Silicon carbide
is an extremely hard industrial chemical and its crystals are widely
available.
The patented Zeneca method is far faster and cheaper than the techniques
used elsewhere for genetic engineering of plants. The company says it has
already used whiskers to add new genes to maize - a crop that is very
difficult to transform with other techniques - and intends to apply the
method to many other plants. Zeneca Seeds: UK, 0428 655049.

Music and software held on cassettes and floppy discs have long been
pirated, costing the entertainment industries millions of pounds in lost
revenues. Now counterfeiters are beginning to copy compact discs, containing
music, software and computer games.
Compact disc manufacturer Disctronics, of West Sussex, has developed a way
of printing colour holograms on to CDs so that a genuine product can easily
be recognised from a fake. The hologram is printed on the master copy of the
disc - for a cost of between Pounds 800 and Pounds 2,200 - and then
replicated.
The hologram can be a sliver of a pattern on the disc or a multi-coloured
pattern which covers the whole surface - an idea Disctronics believes could
prove popular with computer games companies. Disctronics: UK, 0403 732302.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grocery chain Asda is promoting Allan Leighton from marketing to retail
director from the end of the month.
The post had been unoccupied for some months after long-term illness forced
Peter Monaghan, the previous incumbent, to take extended leave last year,
and finally to resign at the end of the year.
Leighton, 40, was brought in by Asda chief executive Archie Norman in March
1992, after a long career with food group Mars, where he was latterly sales
director of Pedigree Petfoods.
As Asda's first marketing director to sit on the main board, Leighton
(below) has led the first phase of the group's recovery programme,
repositioning the group as a more price-led retailer catering for the
'weekly shopping needs of ordinary working families'. He repositioned Asda's
own label and also re-introduced the 'Asda Price' advertising campaign.
Now he will take over the latest phase of the recovery programme -
accelerating the rate of store change and the 'renewal' programme of store
refits. He retains his responsibility for the Dales chain of discount
superstores which Asda has launched.
'The retail director's position is one that has become increasingly
important,' says Asda. 'Moving Allan across is putting our strongest man in
the biggest job.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke yesterday ended nearly two months of uncertainty by announcing that
Tommaso Zanzotto (above) is to become chief executive of its Hilton
International hotels subsidiary.
At the beginning of December the group said it was having discussions with
Michael Hirst, the head of Hilton, about his future. Hirst is a
highly-respected hotelier and news that he would probably be leaving Hilton
contributed to a fall in the Ladbroke share price last month.
The group is thought to have decided that a new head of Hilton International
could make more of one of the world's best-known brand names.
Zanzotto, 52, was previously international president of American Express
Travel Related Services, based in New York. He has worked for American
Express in Italy and Mexico and as president of its Europe, Middle East and
Africa division his move to the US.
Zanzotto, who was born in Italy, was a founding member of the World Travel
and Tourism Council.
Ladbroke says Hirst has decided it was an appropriate time for him to leave
the company, although he will assist his successor until the beginning of
May.

FT  21 JAN 94 / People: Wimpey replaces finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Wood has resigned as finance director of Wimpey, the large UK
housebuilder and construction group, less than three years after joining the
company .
Wimpey says Wood, finance director at Burmah Oil between 1986 and 1990, is
leaving to pursue other business interests.
However, relations between Wimpey and Wood have been strained and a parting
had been expected by the City. The company is understood to have felt that
the former oil industry executive had not made an easy transition to
housebuilding and construction.
Under the terms of his contract Wood is expected to receive a severance
payment of more than Pounds 200,000. He is the latest in a series of board
changes as chief executive Joe Dwyer has moved to strengthen the company's
management, although it was Dwyer who appointed him in April 1991.
Other directors to have left the group since 1991 include Bob Sellier,
managing director, Peter Whitehouse, who headed the group's US operations
and Nelson Oliver who ran the housing division.
Wood is to be replaced by Richard Saville (above), who has been the
company's corporate development director since 1991. Saville was previously
director responsible for oil industry research with Morgan Grenfell
Securities. He joined Wimpey in 1988 as corporate finance executive working
closely with the former finance director Michael Dowdy, since retired. He
was closely involved in the group's disposal programme which has raised more
than Pounds 300m and substantially improved the group's finances.
Saville, 45, will be expected to play a prominent role in Wimpey's plans to
expand the group as the housebuilding and construction markets recover.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Right time for dressing up / A look at the
growing market for wound healing treatments, in a series on drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wound healing is one area of medicine that the pharmaceutical industry has
hardly touched. Although healthcare companies are producing an increasingly
sophisticated range of protective dressings which enable the natural healing
process to take place under good clean conditions, there are few drugs
designed actively to heal wounds.
The position will be very different 10 years from now, if current research
comes up to expectation. Scientists are developing healing combinations of
'growth factors' - natural proteins that regulate cell growth - and creating
new skin by 'tissue engineering' to cover wounds.
The two main types of wound present quite different medical problems.
Chronic wounds are caused by inadequate blood flow in people whose overall
health is generally poor. Examples are diabetic ulcers and pressure sores in
long-stay hospital patients. These may be prevented, to some extent, by
avoiding sustained pressure in any one place, but once formed they are
extremely hard to cure.
Acute wounds are caused by sudden trauma - for example, accident or surgery
 -in otherwise healthy people. The challenge here is not to get them to heal
but to improve the quality of healing by reducing the amount of permanent
scarring. Scar tissue not only looks ugly; it can also cause medical
problems, especially in children, because it is much less flexible than
normal skin.
The outlook for improved treatment seems to be brighter for acute than for
chronic wounds. 'We may understand within five years how to achieve our
ultimate goal - scar-free healing,' says Greg Schultz, a scientist at the
University of Florida Wound Research Institute in the US.
The starting point for research in several laboratories is the observation
that an embryo or foetus heals without any scarring. 'The challenge is to
understand the biochemical differences between adult and foetal healing, and
then recreate foetal conditions in the adult wound,' Shultz says.
Some molecules - notably transforming growth factors beta-1 and beta-2  -
are present in far larger quantities in the adult than in the foetus. Mark
Ferguson, a biology professor at Manchester University in the UK, has
developed a technique to 'neutralise these growth factors so as to restore
the balance to that present in the embryo'.
The Manchester team has achieved scar-free healing in laboratory rats by
blocking TGFB-1 and TGFB-2 and plans to start human trials later this year
with patients undergoing minor surgery. Mannose-6-phosphate, a sugar that
inhibits growth factors, will be used first, followed by neutralising
antibodies.
Ferguson believes the healing process has evolved to close wounds as quickly
as possible under dirty conditions - and scarring is the natural
consequence. 'For our ancestors, it was better to be scarred than dead from
septicaemia (blood poisoning),' he says. 'With contemporary hygiene and
care, the growth factors are in overdrive and they can be reduced to
eliminate scarring without adversely affecting healing.'
The greatest success of scar prevention so far is in patients undergoing eye
surgery - for whom the amount of scar tissue can make the difference between
blindness and sight. Specialists at the University of Florida and Moorfields
Eye Hospital, London, have found that a single touch of 5-fluorouracil, an
anti-cancer drug that inhibits cell proliferation, greatly reduces scarring
after surgery for glaucoma (excessive pressure inside the eye).
Another drug with potential for reducing scarring in the eye after surgery
and chemical burns is Galardin, an enzyme inhibitor. It is in clinical
trials with Glycomed, a Californian biotechnology company.
Attempts to speed up the healing of chronic wounds, which plague an
estimated 3m Americans and a similar number of Europeans, have been less
successful. Several growth factors are undergoing clinical trials but
results so far are generally disappointing.
'One problem is that growth factors work together in combination,' Ferguson
says. 'It may be that we need to add more than one growth factor at a time.'
Curative Technologies, a biotechnology company in East Setauket, New York,
is attempting to get round that problem by extracting a combination of
growth factors from blood platelets. Its first product, Procuren, is derived
from the patient's own blood at the company's chain of 50 wound care
centres; the platelets are isolated by centrifuging a pint of blood and then
treated with an enzyme, thrombin, to stimulate the release of growth
factors.
Curative has gone on to organise clinical trials of a similar product, CT102
 -growth factors extracted from pooled blood donations rather than each
individual patient. Early results showed that the therapy healed 80 per cent
of diabetic foot ulcers, while 29 per cent healed with a placebo dressing.
Acknowledging today's cost conscious environment, Curative commissioned a
study by Arthur D Little, which showed that CT102 reduced the total cost of
treatment per patient by Dollars 13,500 (Pounds 9,000). Wounds are a
significant burden on the world's healthcare systems, costing several
billion dollars a year to treat. In the UK alone, pressure sores and leg
ulcers cost the National Health Service an estimated Pounds 500m a year.
However, even a combination of growth factors may have trouble curing a deep
ulcer, because non-healing wounds contain high levels of enzymes (proteases)
which break down the growth factors before they can do their work. Schultz
says chronic wounds may contain 500 times more protease than healing wounds.
Instead of applying drugs such as growth factors to the wound, an
alternative approach is to cover it with living cells which then make their
own healing chemicals in the correct balance on the spot. Howard Green of
Harvard Medical School discovered in the 1970s how to grow human skin cells
in culture. His technique has been developed by several tissue engineering
companies in the US, including Advanced Tissue Sciences, BioSurface
Technologies and Marrow-Tech.
They use a variety of cell sources, including cadavers and the foreskins of
new-born babies who have just been circumcised, to produce sheets of
artificial skin. These are available as an immediate cover for large acute
wounds and burns. But they are eventually rejected as foreign material by
the patient's immune system.
The ideal wound dressing would be a sheet of skin grown from the patient's
own cells - a process that unfortunately takes a couple of weeks. To speed
things up, Smith &amp; Nephew, the UK healthcare company, is developing a
'living bandage' as a compromise between skin grafting and more conventional
dressings. It consists of a synthetic polymer film seeded with the patient's
skin cells. Within three days these have spread sufficiently for the living
bandage to be applied to the wound, where the skin cells grow down into the
underlying tissues. Eventually, when the regrown skin firmly covers the
wound, the polymer film falls away.
Alan Suggett, Smith &amp; Nephew's R&amp;D director, says the living bandage is
giving encouraging results in preliminary trials on burns patients but he is
cautious about the timing of its commercial release.
Meanwhile Smith &amp; Nephew and other manufacturers of wound dressings are
introducing new polymers to improve the performance of their more
traditional products. For example, Wilshire Medical Products, based in
Dallas, Texas, recently introduced HydroDerm dressings, made from a
transparent polyurethane film; they transmit moisture at a variable rate so
as to keep the wound moist without allowing fluid to build up.
The wound care market is currently worth about Dollars 2bn a year worldwide.
That could double if healing pharmaceuticals make a significant contribution
over the next decade. And millions of patients who now suffer permanent
scarring or chronic ulcers would be immeasurably happier.
The series will continue next month with an article on prostate problems.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Management: Business school blueprint / An examination of
Manchester's plans to go federal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighteen months on from the row over the future of its
internationally-renowned business school, Manchester University is striving
to reassert itself as a top-rank European centre of management education and
research.
Its ambitions include a place in the world league which arguably includes
institutions such as Harvard, Stanford and Northwestern of Illinois in the
US, and Insead, London Business School, Henley, Warwick University and
Cranfield in Europe.
Manchester's aim is to offer 'cradle-to-grave' management education from
undergraduate courses to post-doctoral research, including masters degrees
(MBAs) and a range of shorter courses for experienced managers.
All this will be provided under the umbrella of the new Manchester Federal
School of Business and Management, which comes into being this month and
which will start operating formally in October.
The federation will comprise Manchester Business School, an entirely
postgraduate institution, and three organisations which have all scored five
out of five in the UK government's ratings of quality of research: the
university's department of accountancy and finance, the school of management
at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and
a small group of academics and postgraduates in a group called Prest - a
programme of Policy Research in Engineering Science and Technology. The
federation will have about 200 teaching staff and 2,000 students, of whom
between 35 and 40 per cent will be postgraduates or experienced managers on
courses.
The three main institutions have functioned independently until now but,
according to Martin Harris, the university's vice-chancellor, were competing
fiercely for both staff and students and in danger of triplicating teaching
posts.
Harris says the federation will encourage economy of scale and synergy,
mainly through pooling teaching and research staff. Staff will operate
between the institutions according to demand.
Students will be able to take various combinations of subjects and courses
throughout the federal school, as well as combining them with other relevant
courses, such as the engineering sciences, in the university. A points
system for degrees, with students gaining marks incrementally as they
complete the various constituent modules of combinations of courses, is
planned.
Harris believes the federation will get better financial treatment from the
government's Universities' Funding Council than if Manchester's business and
management functions had gone their own way. Part of the federation's
planning is a project costing up to Pounds 11m to locate all the
institutions near the present business school buildings.
The federation issue was at the heart of the row over the future of
Manchester Business School. The staff were split over whether the school
should go its own way as a practically-oriented, less 'academic' body. Those
favouring autonomy included the school's council of private-sector leaders,
who resigned and asked the government to intervene.
But the government stood back. Tom Cannon, the school's director, left his
post shortly after, although he retains a visiting chair in corporate
governance.
The school, now headed by the internally-promoted Tony Cockerell, has a new
board of private-sector heavyweights, chaired by James Ross, chief executive
of Cable &amp; Wireless, who got his own MBA in Manchester. It includes Sir
Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, whose appointment made up
for the loss of Sir Peter Middleton, one of his predecessors as head of the
Treasury.
Manchester academics naturally hope that the federation marks a new dawn.
'There has been no full-range international business school in the UK until
now,' says Cary Cooper, an American psychologist who works at Umist and is
an authority on managerial stress. 'Most schools concentrate on postgraduate
and post-experience work. In terms of staff numbers, as well as the range of
courses and disciplines covered, this will be pre-eminent.'
There are still plenty of sceptics, however, who wonder if it will work. The
one missing factor is leadership. As most management teachers acknowledge
when talking about organisations generally, many co-operative efforts fail
because ideals, or mutual self-interest, are not enough without someone in
charge to drive them through.
Cooper, who knows more than most about the psychology of leadership in
management, agrees this is a weakness. The hope must be that it is not
exposed. If it is, the old axiom, 'those who can, do; those who can't,
teach,' would rarely have been better exemplified.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Management: Leaders in the vision league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a decade of global restructuring and heavy investment in 'lean
manufacturing' and 'time compression' to speed product development, where
are the world's most responsive manufacturing businesses?
The answer, according to an exhaustive global survey* launched this month by
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, the international accountants and
consultants, is still Japan - but only just.
Overall, the Japanese come closest to having achieved the vision for the
'agile manufacturing enterprise' of the 21st century, says the survey of
1,300 leading manufacturing companies in 11 industrialised nations. It is
probably the most ambitious global exercise in benchmarking manufacturing.
Japanese leadership in this area is important because, as the survey puts
it, 'global competitive battles will be won and lost on an organisation's
ability to tap interface capabilities, particularly in manufacturing, design
and marketing'. The findings suggest that the Japanese have greater
abilities for rapidly introducing new products and increasing production
volumes, because of their superior co-ordination across functions.
However, US and Canadian executives perceive themselves as only slightly
behind the Japanese in terms of agility, though the Europeans and Latin
Americans admit to wider gaps.
'There is little doubt that, in the future, organisations making the
greatest competitive strides will be those that can best integrate
inter-firm and intra-firm activities and can shorten their new product
development times,' says the survey. Spanning traditional functional
boundaries requires radical departures from current operations, it adds.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Management: The trouble with independence - The
privatisation of Pro Ned, the body that puts non-executive directors on the
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British non-executive director came of age this week. On Tuesday the
Bank of England sold Pro Ned, the body that for a decade has championed the
cause of the non-executive, to the sharp end of the private sector.
When Pro Ned was set up in 1982, only 50 per cent of listed companies had
non-executive directors. Of those only 20 per cent were independent. More
than 11 years later there is barely a quoted company that does not have at
least one non-executive director on the board.
The word has been spread and companies have listened. Yet the credit does
not lie altogether with Pro Ned. The recession, the growing power of
institutional investors and the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee
have all put pressure on companies to get independent members on to their
boards.
Even companies like Amstrad, which long held out against the idea, have
recently given up the fight. Morrison Supermarkets, the Bradford-based food
retailer, now stands out as a rare example of a substantial company that
refuses to let any non-executives into its boardroom.
Small and medium-sized companies are also warming to the theme. 3i, the
venture capital organisation, has a list of possible non-executive directors
and supplies about 100 a year. Partnerships such as solicitors, engineers
and mutual insurance firms are also starting to hire non-executives.
During Pro Ned's lifetime, its role has changed from talking to doing. No
longer is it mainly a proselytising body pushing a minority interest, but a
reasonably efficient and reasonably prosperous employment agency for
non-executives. Altogether it has found jobs for more than 600 directors.
The Bank of England, doubtless feeling it did not belong in the headhunting
business, has placed Pro Ned under new and more suitable ownership: a joint
venture between Egon Zehnder, the executive search consultancy, and Pro
Ned's own management.
'Our first objective of raising awareness has been fulfilled,' says Bruce
Rhodes, a director of Pro Ned. 'But we still have a campaigning role, about
how to make appointments, and to find a professional way of getting the
right people on to boards.'
While non-execs are on the way in, the title 'non-executive' is on the way
out. These days the protagonists, including Sir Adrian Cadbury himself, are
making a point of calling them independent directors. Explains John Brill of
headhunters Hanson Green: ''Non-executive' has the connotation of not doing
very much.'
Even though companies are hiring more non-executives, that does not mean
they are making the best use of them. According to David Clutterbuck, author
of The Independent Board Director, it is misleading to take any comfort from
the fact that most companies have at least one non-executive. He argues that
on most boards executives still outnumber non-execs, while the audit and
remuneration committees often still have a strong executive presence.
He also complains that many non-executives do not know what to expect from
the company when they join, whereas most companies are similarly in the dark
about what to expect from their independent directors.
'Most people expect the non-execs to waltz in like John Harvey Jones. But
that is not their role,' he says. Clutterbuck is considering establishing a
club for 100 companies and individuals to share best practice and discuss
matters such as training of non-executives.
He argues that more careful selection of non-execs will solve some of the
problems. Headhunters are only too happy to fill this role: recruiting
non-execs is turning into a profitable little business for them. Ian Butcher
of Whitehead Mann reckons that non-executive recruitment business has
tripled in three years.
Not only has the number of non-executives increased - there are at least
8,000 in the UK - but the proportion of companies seeking outside help with
recruitment has also increased. According to Pro Ned, a year ago two-thirds
of listed companies used the old-boy network to fill vacancies. Now it
estimates that the proportion has fallen to less than half. This year there
will be about 2,000 non-executive appointments to companies of a decent
size. That means a great deal of business for headhunters which charge
between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 30,000 for each appointment.
Yet for all the work it has done, Pro Ned does not enter the private sector
covered in glory. Many people who have failed to get on to its select list
of 900 eligible candidates for non-executive positions argue that its
criteria are too narrow - that many of the people on the list are too old
and too obvious. Others who have managed to get on to the list but who years
later have still not had a single sniff of a job are also restive.
The headhunters argue that Pro Ned's way of selecting clients from a list is
too passive (they put less emphasis on the fact it has also been some Pounds
10,000 cheaper). They argue that only by conducting a search can the perfect
person be found.
Under the new ownership Pro Ned is likely to change, becoming more expensive
as well as more active, going out to find business rather than responding to
companies which have asked.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Property: Los Angeles counts the cost - The LA earthquake is
the latest blow to a US market accustomed to grim news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The earthquake that shook Los Angeles on Monday inflicted an estimated
Dollars 10bn-Dollars 30bn in damage. But early reports indicate that the
city's commercial property sector has suffered relatively lightly.
The damage has been concentrated on infrastructure, apartment buildings and,
to some extent, older shops and office blocks in the suburbs. Modern,
high-quality offices largely escaped damage, partly because they were built
to withstand earthquakes.
In the long run, some property analysts believe that Los Angeles' troubled
commercial property market could, paradoxically, benefit from the
earthquake. 'A lot of apartments, retail and office buildings have been put
out of use (by the earthquake), and this will act to tighten up (reduce
supply) the rest of the market,' says Mr Sol Rabin, of TCW Realty Advisers,
a Los Angeles-based property adviser. Moreover, the construction work
necessary to repair the damage could be a valuable boost for the local
economy.
The Los Angeles property market needs all the help it can get. It is
suffering from a vacancy rate of about 20 per cent for offices, a continuing
haemorrhage of jobs and disinvestment by large property owners.
Yet while the Los Angeles market remains in the doldrums, large parts of the
US property market are starting to climb out of one of the deepest troughs
since the Depression.
Although there is unlikely to be a broadly-based recovery for at least three
more years, the next 12 months will produce some rewards for property
owners, according to Landauer, a US real estate adviser. 'Look for a new
tone of confidence to mark the industry,' it predicts.
Any tonic will be welcome for an industry that has had nothing but bad news
on the economic front in recent years. Defence cuts are likely to result in
the loss of 500,000 jobs by 1997; retail spending continues to be held back
by concern about job security; recession in Japan and Europe is curbing
demand for US goods; and demand for industrial property is weak.
But there is reason for cautious optimism, according to Landauer. It
predicts employment will grow by some 1.5 per cent this year. A gradual
improvement in the economy, combined with a dearth of new commercial
property development, is likely to reduce vacancy rates.
Within the industry liquidity is improving. Falling yields in equity and
bond markets are driving some investors into property in search of higher
returns. Demand is largely fuelled by institutional investors with the
exception of insurance companies, which are finding that new capital
regulations are making property less attractive.
Perhaps the most remarkable recent resurgence of investor interest is that
surrounding the demand for retail investments by so-called 'real estate
investment trusts' (REITs). According to Landauer, the REIT market is
stronger than it has been for more 30 years; the market could grow from
Dollars 15bn in early 1993 to Dollars 100bn in 2000.
Another potential boost could come from foreign investment: some Dollars
2.75bn could be attracted into US real estate in the next year, says
Landauer.
Banks, still smarting from costly property exposures in the late 1980s,
remain cautious about lending to the sector. But, having written down their
bad debts and improved their balance sheets, the banks are now better placed
to resume lending to the sector.
The banks' success will depend on identifying growth areas. Yet, as ever, it
is difficult to generalise about a US market in which conditions within
different regions and different sectors vary markedly.
The office market is still patchy. But Landauer is optimistic the sector
will return to favour with investors. 'Offices will be making the hot
property list within the next three years,' it says.
The fortunes of the office market depend in part on a continuing decline in
construction activity (which would force up prices for existing buildings)
and a return of employment growth. Last year was the best 12-month period
for office take-up since the late 1980s, Landauer says. Net absorption of
office space totalled 60m sq ft, reducing office vacancies by 2 percentage
points to an average of 17 per cent (still above its historical average).
Another decline to 15 per cent is possible by 1995, Landauer says.
But even this level of vacancy rates is unlikely to lead to a big rise in
rents. It will be another four to five years before rents rise to a level
that matches new building costs.
Prospects of a pick-up in offices differ markedly in different parts of the
US, and are largely determined by broader economic trends. For instance,
large-scale jobs cuts have depressed prospects of a turnround in California,
Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Maryland. The
sun belt, by contrast, is performing strongly. The vacancy rate for offices
in Orlando has dropped from 18 per cent two years ago to 14 per cent today.
Job growth has been running at 2.6 per cent over the past year, the result
of initiatives by the state authorities.
At present, offices are still out of favour with investors. The rise of
REITs, which is focused on assets with strong cash flow (from rents), has
excluded offices which tend to have weak operating incomes. As a result, the
investment market is still dominated by tenants and corporate
owner-occupiers with strong knowledge of local markets.
The retail market is still struggling with fundamental problems. Department
stores are suffering from increased competition from discount retailers and
chains of specialist shops. With department stores either consolidating
and/or closing, Landauer warns that as much as a quarter of the regional
mall market could be at risk.
Landauer ranks Seattle, Portland, Honolulu and Orlando among the best-placed
markets. Tulsa, Oklahoma City and New Orleans, where income levels are far
below the national average, showed the weakest potential for growth.
All categories of the industrial market are weak, says Landauer. 'While some
bright spots can be identified, the mass of data is monotonously grey,' it
says. Last year industrial vacancy rates remained high; rents fell; and
while the number of bad loans were reduced for other types of commercial
property, problem loans for industrial properties began to rise.
The residential market is showing strong signs of recovery. House building
has recovered to its 1988 level, a time of frenetic construction; house
prices are rising; mortgage interest rates are low; and investors are
pursuing deals.
The hotel market has bottomed out. A recovery in business travel and tourism
has raised occupancy rates to 67 per cent, a profitable operating level for
the industry.
Overall, Landauer concludes that the property recovery is inching closer.
'To those tough enough and smart enough to have survived the industry's
debacle, rewards are starting to come.'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Playing for high stakes at Lloyd's: Loss-making Names,
hoping to come up trumps, are holding a complex hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a complex game of poker going on between loss-making Lloyd's Names
and the insurance market's authorities.
Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - are
trying to decide whether to accept a Pounds 900m settlement deal, which
offers the great majority less than 40p in the pound for every pound of
loss. They could reject the deal in the hope of securing much greater
compensation for losses of more than Pounds 3bn through the courts.
With less than a month to consider the offer, the odds are that the number
of acceptances will be insufficient to make the deal feasible and that the
protracted legal war between Names and their agents will continue, possibly
for the rest of the decade.
Two of the largest groups of Names taking legal action - members of Gooda
Walker syndicates and Merrett syndicate 418 - have indicated that they will
reject the deal.
Another large group, the Feltrim Names, meet this afternoon and are widely
expected to follow suit, making it unlikely that the majority required by
Lloyd's for the offer to go ahead - 70 per cent of Names by value of the
offer - will be reached by February 14.
Assessment of the merits of the Pounds 900m offer, announced by Lloyd's last
month, is complex. Lloyd's has financed the deal from three sources: Pounds
450m from its central fund - which meets claims when Names cannot meet their
obligations; Pounds 50m in voluntary contributions from Lloyd's agents
involved in the legal actions; and about Pounds 400m from errors and
omissions insurers which cover Lloyd's agents against the cost of legal
awards for negligence.
It seems clear that neither the central fund contribution nor agents'
contributions can be increased, but considerable uncertainty surrounds the
contributions and potential exposure of the E&amp;O insurers, which, to
complicate matters, are themselves Lloyd's syndicates.
The document detailing the offer terms states that the total exposure of the
E&amp;O insurers to the agents named in the legal action stands at between
Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m.
However, according to some market sources, not all of this cover would be
triggered even if all the Names' legal actions were completely successful,
an outcome which must be regarded as unlikely.
Even then the money would not be paid out for some time, since it will be
years before all the legal cases are heard and awards made.
Action group leaders insist that Names can obtain better terms than those
currently on offer, by pressing ahead with legal action and, possibly, by
bringing E&amp;O insurers and Lloyd's back to the negotiating table.
The leaders argue, for example, that successful legal action would make it
easier for E&amp;O insurers to make claims on their own reinsurance policies,
mainly placed with large European companies.
Lloyd's arguments have cut little ice with those Names hardest hit by the
market's losses, who argue they cannot afford to settle.
'All the settlement does is reduce you from being bust twice over to being
bust once,' says Ms Marie Louise Burrows, chairman of the Lime Street Action
Group, whose members have been offered compensation of more than 50p in the
pound for average losses to date of Pounds 2.4m per head. Even so the cost
of rejection could be high. Success by Names whose cases come to court first
could rapidly deplete funds available for other groups.
Many Names are members of several loss-making syndicates, so they might find
gains from one action offset by losses elsewhere.
Names will also face heavy legal costs. Even if successful they would be
liable to pay not only their own legal fees, but also, under the terms of
E&amp;O policies, their opponents' fees.
Most importantly, Names run the risk that following the strengthening of
Lloyd's capital base - with capacity increasing by 20 per cent in 1994 -
their ability to extract concessions from the market could be reduced.
In the words of Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor of Chatset, which monitors the
market, Lloyd's could 'let the whole thing expire quietly and go ahead and
forget about the distressed Names'.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Redwood accused of being cereal killer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A parish boundary runs through a field of winter barley on Mr Roger Jones's
100-hectare farm which borders the Rhymney Valley in Gwent, south Wales. The
barley on one side will earn him Pounds 191 a hectare in aid from Brussels.
On the other it will be eligible for Pounds 98 a hectare at the most.
'It doesn't make sense,' he said. 'It's all the same land.'
Mr Jones's problem arises from government proposals to divide Wales into two
regions to determine the amount of compensation that arable farmers will be
paid now Brussels has reduced its support prices.
The government is under heavy pressure from Wales's 4,000 cereal growers to
drop the complex two-tier system, which is based on the amount of land under
cereal production in each of the country's 1,000 parishes. The farmers say
it is unfair and divisive.
Mr Owen Williams, a neighbour of Mr Jones, grows cereals in the Rhymney
Valley. Because he is in a mainly hilly parish that produces under 50
hectares of winter cereals - the cut-off figure - he will qualify only for
the lower payments. 'It's absolutely ludicrous,' he said. 'Our farm was left
out of the 'less favoured area' grants because it was considered too
productive.'
Mr Williams produces more than 7 tonnes of cereals a hectare, much the same
as Mr Jones a mile away. 'Our land is capable of growing crops equal to
anything they can grow in England,' he adds.
Like Mr Jones, he has appealed to the Welsh Office about the decision, which
he said would cost him between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 5,000.
Mr Frank Leguen de Lacroix, a European Commission agriculture official
invited to Wales by the National Farmers' Union earlier this month, is
raising the matter with UK officials. He said he was puzzled by the scheme,
which appeared to set one grower against another.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, proposed dividing Wales last year after
Welsh arable farmers objected to being paid less compensation than those in
England.
The aim was to bring more Welsh growers into the higher payment category
used in England. Mr Redwood said at the time that the plan was the most
equitable possible.
But the NFU, which represents growers in both England and Wales, wants the
government to start again. It says the two countries should be treated as a
single region, with the same payments for all farms.
Redistributing the total aid package among English and Welsh farmers would
entail a cut of only about 52p a tonne for English producers, says the
union. 'The alternative, with the Gatt cuts coming, could be the end of
cereal growing for those who are left so far behind,' it said.
A government announcement is expected shortly. The farmers suspect Mr
Redwood may abandon the plan and return to a simple division between England
and Wales. They resent that just as much.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Milk board may sell two offshoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milk Marketing Board could be forced to hive off its artificial
insemination section and its milk testing business to get government
approval for its plans to transform itself into a farmers' co-operative.
Genus, which provides advice and semen for breeding dairy cattle, could be
floated off as an unlisted company or made into a government body. The
business had a turnover last year of Pounds 35m with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4m.
However, the future of National Milk Records is more problematic because it
is closely integrated with the board's daily activities, according to Mr
Andrew Dare, chief executive. He will head Milk Marque, as the new
co-operative will be known, when the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and
Wales is opened to competition later this year.
Mr Dare said: 'It would be quite a headache to split it off.'
The flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's processing division, has been
delayed from next month to June or July because of government objections
over plans to reorganise the board.
Options for separating both Genus and National Milk Records are under
review.
The board must decide by Monday whether to hive off both business units to
satisfy government concerns about its dominant position in the market. Mr
Dare will meet officials from the agriculture ministry on Monday to complete
changes to plans for turning the board into Milk Marque.
Government queries over the board's plans have delayed the introduction of
competition into the milk market from April to either the beginning of
August or October.
Mr Dare said: 'I want to be able to prove that a properly managed and
properly financed farmers' co-op can succeed. We have to get it right now.'
Mr Dare has agreed with the government that the new body will have a capital
base of Pounds 37.5m excluding Genus and National Milk Records. Apart from
their future, all of the government's misgivings over the reorganisation
have been cleared up, he said.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Clarke says tax rises can be absorbed by recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, defended his handling of the economy
yesterday as the Inland Revenue sent notification to taxpayers of tax
increases announced in the last two Budgets.
Mr Clarke said the recovery would be 'checked' by the tax increases. But he
insisted that the recovery was 'strong enough for those tax rises to be
taken in its stride'.
His defence of government economic policy was echoed in the Commons by Mr
John Major, the prime minister, in the face of renewed Labour claims that
the government had broken its election promises on taxation.
The government also threatened to expose further Labour 'smears', and
widened its offensive against the Liberal Democrats.
In a further indication of the government's determination to take the
political offensive, the cabinet decided to mount a high-profile campaign
for the European parliament elections in June.
Mr Clarke told BBC radio that the tax increases would 'take a bit of the
edge off consumer demand, which the figures show is much stronger now than
it was 12 months ago'.
However, he said, the impact of the tax rises would be offset by reductions
in mortgage interest rates. He also gave his clearest indication yet that he
is not considering a further cut in interest rates to ease tax rises or
increase export competitiveness.
Mr Clarke recalled that Lord Lawson, chancellor from 1983-89, was also urged
by commentators and opposition MPs to stimulate demand by cutting interest
rates.
'Nigel Lawson . . . would agree, looking back, that he had already reduced
them too much,' he said. 'On that front you have to set yourself a clear
idea of when you change interest rates and stick to it, not be influenced by
what the papers say in the morning.'
Mr Clarke said his judgment on interest rates would reflect 'what is right,
not only to sustain the recovery, but also to make sure that over the medium
term we take the opportunity of keeping inflation down'.
Senior Conservatives said the improving economy would provide the background
for a sustained offensive against the opposition parties.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Gas users predict tighter regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gas Consumers Council has predicted that regulation of the gas supply
industry will need to be tightened as the domestic monopoly controlled by
British Gas is opened to full competition in 1998.
Mr Ian Powe, council director, will tell a conference today that Ofgas, the
industry regulator, will have to oversee the sector's transition away from
the present regulatory regime under which government bodies from the
Department of Trade and Industry to the Office of Fair Trading have
occasionally conflicting roles in the sector to one of 'controlled
competition' in which Ofgas should be the sole authority.
He adds: 'Whether we like it or not, we are going to see more regulation,
not less, as competition grows.'
He says the main challenge for Ofgas will be to hold down prices to the
consumer while managing the transition of the industry to a strict
cost-related structure to encourage competition and consumer choice.
Mr Powe attacks British Gas in his speech, accusing it of 'scaremongering'
during last year's debate on the future of the industry.
He rejects the notion that consumers should pay for British Gas' corporate
reorganisation years, and warns against relaxing the present price-setting
arrangement, based on on the retail price index minus five percentage
points.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Car output rises to 20-year peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK car production rose 6.5 per cent last year to the highest level since
1974 with the help of growing output by the Japanese carmakers Nissan,
Toyota and Honda.
Nissan is expected to emerge as the leading British car exporter for last
year ahead of Rover, Vauxhall and Ford.
The increase in UK car output to 1,375,523 from 1,291,880 in 1992 was in
sharp contrast to steep declines in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
Production is forecast to rise further this year in spite of weak demand in
export markets.
The increase last year was supported by recovery in new-car demand in the
domestic market, according to figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Production for the UK market rose 19.9 per cent to 842,647. Output for
export declined 9.6 per cent to 532,876, accounting for 38.7 per cent of
total UK car output last year compared with 45.6 per cent in 1992 and 48.9
per cent in 1991.
Car production in December alone fell 8.8 per cent to 86,928 from 95,301 in
the same month a year before, as several producers imposed short-time
working to cope with weak demand in continental European markets.
'The slow move out of recession by the UK economy does not compensate for a
dearth of orders from the rest of Europe,' said Mr Roger King, SMMT director
of public affairs. 'There is little sign of this situation improving in the
near future.'
UK car production is forecast to rise steadily through the mid-1990s as
output grows at the new Japanese car plants in Britain. The Toyota and Honda
plants have just completed their first year of production, and output is
expected to rise sharply again this year.
Nissan said yesterday that its output had risen by 37.6 per cent to 246,278
from 179,000 in 1992. Nissan has been forced to abandon the second shift and
reduce the workforce at its Sunderland plant since early November in
response to weak sales in continental Europe.
The company said yesterday that it expected to resume working three of its
normal four night shifts a week from the beginning of March. Output this
year is expected to fall to between 200,000 and 240,000. The company said
yesterday that the workforce at its car plant had been cut to 4,250 at the
end of December from 4,600 at the end of October.
The plant is expected to lose 550 to 600 jobs - about 12 per cent of the
workforce - through a voluntary separation package begun in November.
UK commercial vehicle output fell sharply last year by 22.2 per cent to
193,414 from 248,453 a year earlier, the SMMT said yesterday. December
production fell by 25.4 per cent year-on-year to 11,243.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Sales of machine tools recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK machine tool market is emerging from three years of recession,
figures from the Central Statistical Office indicated yesterday.
They showed a 13.6 per cent rise in domestic sales in the three months to
November compared with the three previous months. The figures were based on
1990 constant prices, seasonally adjusted.
Export sales fell 24.3 per cent, underlining the severity of the recession
in important continental export markets such as Germany. The fall in exports
left total sales for the UK industry down 3.3 per cent from the previous
three months and 11.6 per cent lower than a year before.
The UK machine tool industry has been one of the worst hit by the clampdown
on capital spending by the country's industry since 1991. Evidence of a
recovery has broad implications that go beyond the machine tool industry.
One supplier of press-working equipment, Swiss-owned Bruderer UK, said this
week that turnover was running 80 per cent up on 1992. Other builders of
machine tools are known to be busier than at any time in the past three
years.
At current prices, total sales averaged Pounds 74.5m a month in the three
months to November, down 0.7 per cent on the same period a year before. That
drop was caused by a fall of 17.1 per cent in export sales, partially offset
by a rise of 5.8 per cent in domestic sales.
The Machine Tool Technologies Association said total exports fell 12.5 per
cent to Pounds 147.1m in the first half of last year.
Exports to the US, the biggest single market for UK machine tools, rose
nearly 20 per cent while sales to Germany, the second-largest market, sank
by 45 per cent.
China, which ranked as only the 22nd-biggest market for the UK's machine
tools in the first half of 1992, leapt into third place a year later, with a
512 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 12.1m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
England's ancient sale-of-goods laws, which set out the ways in which a
purchaser can get good title to goods bought in good faith from someone who
does not own them, are to be reviewed, the government announced yesterday.
A consultation paper proposes replacing the detailed rules in the 1979 Sale
of Goods Act with a broad principle that where goods have been entrusted to
someone by the owner an innocent purchaser should get good title, abolishing
the rule on sales in market overt (ancient markets), and extending the
protection given to purchasers of cars on hire purchase to other goods.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Manager wins 'too pretty for job' case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An area sales manager who was told by her bosses that she was too pretty for
her job has won her claim for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal.
Ms Tracey Gatehouse, 24, went to an industrial tribunal in Liverpool last
year after leaving her Pounds 9,500-a-year job at Warrington-based gaming
machine operators Stretton Leisure, a subsidiary of brewers Greenall
Whitley.
The managing director had said he objected to her looking 'disco-fied' and
the regional sales manager told her her good looks could make the wives of
pub landlords jealous as she toured premises.
The tribunal yesterday found by a majority that Mr Barrett's comments were
'gratuitous and offensively put'.
It will later fix compensation unless the parties can agree a financial
settlement.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Top Civil servants court industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior company executives are to be told next week that they may be able to
boost their business prospects - by employing a civil servant.
The message will be delivered by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary and
head of the civil service, at a private lunch in London on Tuesday for
directors of 17 big companies.
The gathering is aimed at helping Whitehall officials expand their view of
the world by giving more of them a taste of life in industry through
part-time advisory jobs.
To overcome any scepticism about the commercial acumen of civil servants,
Sir Robin will also stress the role of Whitehall officials in giving a fresh
view of business problems and in helping companies to build up sales and
profits.
The lunch has been arranged by the Whitehall and Industry Group, a charity
funded by the government and 64 big companies including Midland Bank,
Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds and British Telecommunications.
An official on the initiative said: 'Companies do not generally come
knocking on our doors asking to employ civil servants. You have to do some
persuading to tell them what the potential benefits can be.'
Mr John Sacher, a director of Marks and Spencer who is chairman of the
Whitehall and Industry Group, said that many civil servants who had worked
part-time in companies had proved 'extremely constructive'. He added: 'We
are talking about high-flyers who have a lot to contribute to strategic
issues.'
The lunch fits in with efforts by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to
promote a more sympathetic view of wealth creation by officials across
Whitehall.
The main aim of the lunch is to increase the number of civil servants
working part-time as non-executive members of subsidiary boards from about
50 to possibly 100.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Braer report accuses captain of dereliction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek captain of the Liberian-registered tanker Braer, which caused an
oil spill when it ran aground on Shetland last January, is accused in the
official report on the incident of 'serious dereliction of duty'.
Captain Alexandros Gelis is blamed for not taking action to deal with pipes
which had broken free on the deck of the tanker in stormy seas during the
voyage. These pipes damaged air pipes to the ship's fuel tanks, allowing
seawater to enter and contaminate the fuel supply. This eventually caused
the engine to stop and the ship to drift on to the shore.
The report, by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department of
Transport, says that Captain Gelis failed to have the loose pipes re-secured
or jettisoned, and failed 'simply to observe them to see the damage they may
have been causing'.
It also criticises him for allowing officers and ratings to spend all their
bridge duty inside the wheelhouse, which meant that they were not aware of
what was happening out of view on deck.
The Braer, which was carrying 85,000 tonnes of crude oil from Mongstad in
Norway to Quebec city in Canada, broke down at 4.40 am on January 5 1993.
Its crew was evacuated by helicopter just before the Star Sirius, a tug sent
from Lerwick, arrived at 9.15 am. The ship ran aground at Garth's Ness at
11.20 am.
The quality of the senior crew on the ship, 'while no doubt typical of many
hundreds of other vessels trading at sea today, left much to be desired',
the report states. In most other respects, however, the Braer's captain and
officers made correct decisions and displayed excellent seamanship.
However the report rejects allegations that the ship was defective and that
she should not have been sailing through the 25-mile-wide Fair Isle channel
between Shetland and Orkney. It says the ship was 'structurally sound with
no known significant deficiencies' and that her planned route was a normal
one.
The coastguard in Shetland is criticised for not responding with sufficient
urgency to the request from the tanker for a tug to take it in tow, even
though the captain did not use the appropriate urgency prefixes in making
the request. However it says that even if the tugs had been despatched with
minimum delay they would have been too late to prevent the ship grounding.
The government says it has issued new guidelines to coastguards to relay
immediately a request for tug assistance from a ship carrying oil or
dangerous cargo, whether or not the ship has declared an emergency
situation.
Ms Joan Walley MP, a member of Labour's transport team, said: 'It is no good
scapegoating the captain of the Braer when government shipping policy over
the last 15 years has effectively been to accept the practice, by some
countries, of prostituting their flags for a few pieces of silver.'
B+H Shipmanagement of Stamford, Connecticut, US, the Braer's operators, said
the report did not give enough weight to the severity of the weather at the
time. It relied 'excessively upon hindsight' in criticising the officers.
Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, urged the
government to act to ensure there was 'proper radar surveillance' of
Britain's coastline.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Sellafield workers face ban on voting in council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copeland Borough Council, the local authority responsible for planning
decisions relating to British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield plant, has received
legal advice that councillors who work for BNF should not vote on
applications made by their employer.
Until now Copeland councillors employed by BNF have been allowed to vote on
its applications for permission for sometimes controversial developments at
the west Cumbria nuclear-waste reprocessing site.
But in response to a Copeland council request for legal guidance Mr Steven
Cockman QC, a specialist in local government law, has advised that
councillors should declare an interest and not vote on applications by their
employer or their spouses' employer.
If Labour-controlled Copeland implements this advice, it would change the
balance of power on the key planning and services committee, where four of
the seven Labour members are BNF employees.
Their withdrawal when BNF applications were being considered would leave
three Labour members, four Conservatives and one independent.
Nine of Copeland's 53 councillors are Sellafield employees of BNF, the
area's dominant employer. They include Labour and Conservative members.
Several others are married to BNF employees. Legal guidance was sought
during a council review of its standing orders. A decision on whether to
implement the QC's advice will be taken following a debate at the next full
council meeting next month.
Some councillors are unhappy at the proposal, believing their workplace
experience gives them useful knowledge to contribute to decisions.
Under the Department of the Environment's national code, councillors should
normally declare an interest and not vote when they have a pecuniary or
other direct interest. But the department said it was up to councils how
they interpreted this guidance.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Labour leads attack on homes reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour joined forces with some of Britain's leading pressure groups
yesterday to attack the government's proposals to reform the allocation of
council housing to the homeless.
The proposals, which came in a consultation paper issued by Sir George
Young, the housing minister, would abolish the rule allowing people classed
as 'statutorily homeless' - many of whom are single mothers - to receive an
automatic right to a council house.
Under the proposals all applicants for council accommodation would have to
join a waiting list. However, local authorities would single out people who
were in emergency need of housing and place them in temporary accommodation.
But these people would have to compete with everyone else on the waiting
list before receiving a secured tenancy. The 'fast track' by which these
people now acquire council accommodation in perpetuity would be abolished.
The reforms could disadvantage single mothers who make up some 45 per cent
of the statutorily homeless, and now receive priority.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, attacked the policy, saying
that a chronic shortage of affordable homes had created the problem.
He added: 'With Labour, 100,000 new homes were built for rent by councils
and housing associations. Under the Tories that has been cut to a third.'
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the housing charity, claimed that
the new system would leave families moving from one temporary home to
another until a secure tenancy could be found.
'Do we really want to see families who don't know where their children will
be at school next term or whether they will be able to get to their job, if
they have one, and what the future holds for them?' she asked.
However, Sir George said yesterday that the proposals were aimed at curbing
the practice by which people living with their parents left home, declared
themselves 'statutorily homeless' and received accommodation ahead of other
applicants.
This, he said, was to the dis-advantage of people who stayed with parents
while joining a housing association waiting list. Under the new proposals,
people who leave their parents' home would not be treated as an emergency.
Sir George also said that he would be looking at ways for local authorities
to offer applicants rented accommodation in the private sector. This would
be paid for by housing benefit up to a certain level, possibly topped up by
a local authority grant.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Pensions rule withdrawn in tendering row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of the Environment has climbed down over new regulations
which would have forced private companies taking over local authority
contracts to offer employees 'broadly comparable' pensions.
Contractors claimed the ruling would make it impossible for small companies
to bid for council business, as they would not have the resources to match
public-sector pensions, which are usually index-linked.
After meeting contractors on Wednesday, Mr Tony Baldry, the environment
minister, decided to withdraw the department's pensions advice, which was
issued to the press on Tuesday, and was due to be announced in the Commons
today.
Mr Baldry will now restrict his statement to the Commons today to the
Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations, known as Tupe,
which also affect local authority contracting.
The department's change of heart was attacked by contractors, local
authorities and unions.
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman of Clause 26, a contractors' lobby group, described
the position as 'chaos', and predicted that the pensions provisions would
eventually be enforced, as similar rulings had been made regarding
contracting out from the National Health Service.
The Association of Direct Labour Organisations said competition would be
distorted if contractors were not required to offer the same employment
package to employees, and claimed the environment department's original
guidance was correct.
The department said that the decision had been taken because it needed to
consult other departments over the pensions issue, which is covered by the
Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act of 1978.
Mr Gummer will also announce today that where a local authority believes
that Tupe applies but a contractor does not, the authority can, after taking
legal advice, properly decide not to proceed with the tender.
Mr Davis-Coleman said this ruling would mean 'the end of compulsory
competitive tendering'. If Tupe applies to a particular contract, a
contractor taking over council work is obliged to keep the existing
workforce, on the same pay and conditions, and cannot save money by cutting
pay.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Goldsmith aids Greenpeace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, has offered to back
Greenpeace, the pressure group, in its court battle to stop the Thorp
nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria.
The Goldsmith Foundation, set up by Sir James and his brother Edward,
yesterday said it would pay part of Greenpeace's legal costs if the pressure
group lost the case. The Goldsmiths have backed several anti-nuclear
campaigns. Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace UK, said Greenpeace could
call on 'more than Pounds 100,000' from the foundation if it lost the court
battle.
'I think he has backed us because he feels, as we do, that we have a strong
case and that it is possible to stop Thorp,' said Lord Melchett. Greenpeace
has raised Pounds 205,000 towards its costs from a special appeal to its
supporters.
The government announced its decision to give the go-ahead to the Pounds
2.8bn plant before Christmas. The licence came into effect on January 17,
but the plant is not expected to become fully radioactive until
mid-February.
Greenpeace will bring a High Court challenge to the decision on February 7.
The pressure group lost an earlier court attempt in September to stop
testing of the plant.
British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner, said last night: that the news was
'not a complete surprise' as Sir James was reported to have backed other
anti-Thorp campaigns.

FT  21 JAN 94 / BSkyB setback over pirate cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting has suffered a serious setback in its efforts to
prevent the distribution in Ireland and Continental Europe of pirated 'smart
cards', which threaten to undermine the company's principal source of
income.
The High Court in Dublin yesterday rejected a claim by BSkyB for a temporary
restraining order, pending trial, against Mr David Lyons, the managing
director of Satellite Decoding Systems. Mr Lyons is distributing the cards
from Birr, County Offaly.
Mr Lyons' smart cards can break the VideoCrypt code used to scramble the
satellite TV channels broadcast by BSkyB. BSkyB - in which Pearson the owner
of the Financial Times has a substantial stake - claims that its code has
been copied by Mr Lyons, infringing its rights under copyright law. The
rejection was made because BSkyB had failed to produce sufficient evidence
that there was an infringement of copyright.
Mr Lyons says the microchips, software and algorithms - which give command
instructions to the software in the chip - in his cards are different from
those used by BSkyB. He had offered to have an independent arbitrator
examine both types of card. BSkyB declined the offer.
Mr Justice Flood said: 'The results of a (computer) programme must not be
confused with copyright. The fruits of a programme are not direct evidence
of any similarity (between programmes).'
The judge ordered costs to be awarded to Mr Lyons. He also ordered the
return of several hundred cards seized by BSkyB under an earlier court
order.
Mr Lyons said he might reconsider a voluntary undertaking, made to BSkyB
last October, not to distribute his cards in the UK.
The sale of subscriptions, for which BSkyB issues cards, forms 80 per cent
of its income.

Labour yesterday tried to contain its embarrassment over a trip to Iraq by
Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, by issuing him with a
'severe reprimand', James Blitz writes.
Mr Derek Foster, opposition chief whip, gave Mr Galloway 'a final warning',
following an appearance on Iraqi television earlier this week in which the
MP appeared to praise President Saddam Hussein.
It was understood yesterday that some shadow cabinet members were
considering raising Mr Galloway's behaviour at the next meeting of the
party's national executive committee, with a view to having him removed as a
candidate at the next election.
Mr Galloway yesterday promised the whips that he would obey all their future
instructions, and apologised for his television appearance, expressing 'deep
regret for any offence or pain' given to families of Gulf war victims.

The government's reform of the structure of local government is to face a

judicial review of the proposals to replace it by four unitary authorities.
The council has called on the government to reconsider the whole basis and

It calls for the status quo to be retained because transitional costs have
been 'significantly underestimated', running costs will not be reduced, and
'democratic accountability will be eroded and not strengthened'.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Branson lottery bid in place soon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson's Lottery Foundation is expected to announce within the
next few days that all its financing is in place to mount a bid to run the
National Lottery.
There was some speculation that the foundation might have difficulty raising
the capital because all the profits from the lottery would go to a
charitable foundation.
Agreement on financing has already been reached in principle and the legal
details are set to be tied up by next week.
The foundation, co-founded by Mr Branson, Virgin chairman, and Lord Young,
the former trade and industry secretary, is expected to be one of eight
bidders for the national licence.
At the formal launch of the foundation yesterday, the organisation published
an opinion poll saying that 72 per cent of the British public wanted all the
profits from the lottery to go to good causes. Just 23 per cent believed the
operating company should keep profits for itself. Around 64 per cent said
they would be more likely to play the lottery if the profits went to good
causes.
Bids have to be in by February 14, and it is estimated that in three or four
years the lottery could have annual revenues of between Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 4bn.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Officers at P&amp;O vote to strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ships' officers, excluding masters, employed by P&amp;O European Ferries
yesterday voted to strike against the company's sweeping reform of
employment contracts, Robert Taylor writes.
The changes are designed to make cost savings on services from Felixstowe in
Suffolk, to Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in south-west Scotland.
Workers at the three ports have agreed not to take ships to sea or provide
services for limited periods not exceeding 24 hours. The action was passed
by 121 votes to 23, by P&amp;O members of Numast, the merchant navy officers'
union.
Today P&amp;O managers are due to meet officials from the RMT transport union to
try to prevent strike action by crews on the same ferry services. The crews
are opposed to the radical changes in working hours and to a pay freeze.
Yesterday's decision will add to pressure on the company to modify its
cost-cutting plans. P&amp;O has already threatened to dismiss employees who
strike or refuse to accept the new terms.
Numast is concerned at the safety implications of some of the changes, with
officers working longer hours.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Halifax may enter rented sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, might be prepared to become a
private landlord if the government offered financial incentives to encourage
the rented sector, Mr Mike Blackburn, the society's chief executive, said
yesterday.
Mr Blackburn, addressing a Council of Mortgage Lenders conference in
Edinburgh, accused the government of turning its back on the housing market.
Tax allowances for homeowners and funding for social housing were being
reduced simultaneously, reversing almost 50 years of postwar policy.
He said: 'Households need further choice than simply between owning their
homes and moving into socially rented accommodation. In other countries this
is provided by private rented housing. In the UK this effectively does not
exist.' Private rented housing had fallen to just 9 per cent of the UK
housing market - 6 per cent in Scotland.
Mr Blackburn said that while the 1988 Housing Act had 'swept away' most of
the controls on renting that had been important factors in its decline
without subsidy it remained financially unattractive.
He said Halifax might consider entering the private rented market if it
became more commercially attractive, 'possibly through the ownership of a
company providing such accommodation'.
He added: 'It would hopefully be profitable and further enhance our
reserves. Most importantly it would help maintain our links with potential
borrowers providing them with rented accommodation for the early years of
their housing careers, before they take on a mortgage.'
Halifax said it would favour tax allowances rather than grants.
The society said that private renting could 'become an important new market
for our commercial lending'. It added: 'We would like to see potential
borrowers given more choice of tenure.'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Video-on-demand set for homes test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Oracle, the US software company, said yesterday that it planned to launched
limited trials of its video-on-demand system, Media Server, in the UK within
the next few months.
The system, which can handle thousands of transactions a second in audio,
video and text, is being evaluated by British Telecommunications.
Oracle plans to launch its first video-on-demand experimental service for
around 60 homes in the Ipswich area in the spring.
Mr Jim Abrahamson, chairman of Oracle Corporation, which had revenues of
Dollars 1.5bn in the year to May, promised that a more extensive trial
involving 250,000 homes in Washington DC would go ahead later this year
following the announcement of a joint development deal with Bell Atlantic,
the US telephone company.
Video-on-demand services allow consumers to order the film or television
programme of their choice to be relayed down conventional telephone lines or
cable television networks.
The technology was based on 'massively parallel processing' - a system
containing several thousand microprocessors so that 1,700 different films
could be played out for different customers at the same time.
Oracle said yesterday that if 1m homes were connected, the cost of the
system - including the black box in the home needed to convert the signal -
would be Pounds 50 a year for each home.
A commercial presentation in London organised by Oracle attracted around
1,000 people from the UK and other European countries. This was an
indication of the interest in what is known in the US as 'information
superhighways'.
Apart from video-on demand, the system can also be used for other services,
from home shopping to home banking.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Scientists seek to ease fears as ozone layer thins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The thinning of the ozone layer has hit record levels, government scientists
said yesterday. But they also predicted that ozone levels would return to
normal towards the end of the next century if countries observe new treaties
curbing harmful chemicals.
At the publication of a government report on ozone, scientists also warned
that fears about an increase in skin cancer rates were sometimes
exaggerated.
The layer of ozone gas in the upper atmosphere shields people and plants
from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays.
Mr Joe Farman, the scientist who discovered a 'hole' in the ozone layer over
the Antarctic, said yesterday that thinning would be at its worst around
2005.
According to the report, ozone levels over the UK in the winter of 1992-93
were the lowest since records began in 1979 - a thinning of about a quarter
in the past decade. The ozone layer is thinner in winter than it is in the
summer because of atmospheric pressure changes.
The thinning in 1992-93 was partly due to natural factors: the 1991 eruption
of the Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines, and an anticyclone over
the northern hemisphere. Preliminary figures for the end of 1993 show some
improvement, scientists said.
Mr Farman said people's fears about the danger of ozone thinning were
sometimes out of proportion. 'The bigger problem may be disruption of insect
life and pollination of plants,' he said. 'Human beings can put on a hat and
sunscreen; bees can't do that.'
The extra dose of radiation which people in the northern hemisphere will
receive by 2005 because of ozone thinning will be roughly the same as they
would get by moving from Aberdeen to a sunnier climate such as the south of
France, he added.
The Montreal Protocol, renegotiated in Copenhagen in 1992, commits countries
to phasing out the production of industrial chlorine gases (CFCs) mainly
used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.
Environmentalists and scientists now want the ban to cover other chemicals
including HCFCs - a replacement for CFCs - and methyl bromide, widely used
to preserve fruit, vegetables and crops.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, said: 'It is to the world's
credit that a treaty has been agreed, but it should now be extended.'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Navy to have 18 more BAe Harriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubts over the government's plans for the Royal Navy's fleet of Sea Harrier
jump-jets were lifted yesterday with the announcement of an order for 18 new
aircraft worth a total of between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m.
The contract comes as a boost to British Aerospace's military aircraft
division after more than 1,300 job losses announced in the past week in its
civil aircraft and missile operations.
The deal, awaited since last spring, was confirmed by Mr Jonathan Aitken,
defence procurement minister, in a written parliamentary answer.
BAe's work on building the improved FRS. 2 Sea Harriers is valued at around
Pounds 200m, but this does not include the Rolls-Royce engines and other
equipment.
Fears were raised last autumn that the contract might be affected by defence
budget cuts. BAe had hoped the contract would be announced at the time of
the Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition in September.
Yesterday's deal includes the conversion of a further five earlier-model
aircraft to the FRS. 2 standard. These are in addition to 29 conversions
being carried out under a Pounds 170m contract which BAe signed in 1988.
Most of the work will be carried out at BAe's Brough plant in Humberside,
with final assembly at Dunsfold, near Guildford, Surrey. Deliveries are due
to start next year.

FT  21 JAN 94 / WDA to be sued for unfair dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former senior executive of the Welsh Development Agency, who was sacked in
the wake of scathing criticisms of the agency by a Commons committee, is
claiming unfair dismissal.
Mr Michael Henry, executive director of corporate services, was dismissed in
October after a report by an independent inquiry set up by Mr David
Rowe-Beddoe, the WDA's newly-appointed chairman, in response to condemnation
by the public accounts committee.
'I've been made a scapegoat by the WDA,' Mr Henry said yesterday. 'I would
like an opportunity to state my case and I am determined to clear my name.'
Mr Henry, who managed the agency's Pounds 165m annual budget, is to bring
his case to an industrial tribunal supported by Unison, the public services
union. The union said a separate action for alleged defamation was 'under
active consideration'.
The WDA said it had referred the matter to its lawyers.
Mr Henry, now a self-employed accountant, had been with the agency since
1978 and was an executive director for six years. He was not a board member.
Together with Dr Gwyn Jones, the WDA's then chairman, and Mr Philip Head,
the chief executive, he was questioned by the Commons committee which
subsequently said the 'top echelons' of the agency had 'presided over a
catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of
control and accountability'.

FT  21 JAN 94 / EU rules curtail Bank's investigation powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severe restrictions to the Bank of England's powers to intervene in cases of
alleged misconduct at London branches of banks with headquarters in other
parts of the European Union are disclosed in a letter from the Bank to a
British businessman.
The letter, written by Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's director in charge of
banking supervision, was sent a few days ago to Mr Andre Levy, who is suing
ABN Amro, the big Dutch bank, for negligence.
Mr Quinn says in his letter that the implementation last year of the EU's
Second Banking Co-ordination Directive means that: 'The Bank's powers to
intervene in ABN Amro Bank's affairs have been considerably reduced . . .
and do not extend to questions of the fitness and properness of the
managers.
'It follows that your concerns about ABN Amro Bank's conduct and management
should in future be directed to the de Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central
bank) as the relevant home supervisory authority.'
Before the Bank passed responsibility for the case to the Dutch central bank
last year, it felt that the dispute between Mr Levy and ABN Amro was a
commercial one and did not raise issues of relevance to it as a supervisor.
However, the Bank has continued to receive information on the case since it
handed over responsibility for it. The Bank refused to comment yesterday on
whether it now took a harsher view of ABN Amro's conduct.
The Bank has received evidence from Mr Levy and two other companies,
Chieftain and Scanfisheries, that in late 1990 and 1991, Amro managers
advised them to raise money through complex borrowing schemes arranged by Mr
Bruce Picken of PMC Financial Services. In all three cases, Mr Picken asked
for advance fees totalling several hundred thousand dollars.
The three companies say Mr Picken's failure to produce the funds led to
significant costs and disruption - although they all say that they refused
to pay the advance fees.
Mr Picken was declared a bankrupt in May 1991 and is believed to have left
the country.
Mr Quinn's letter is the most blunt admission to date that one effect of the
directive is to curtail the powers of supervisors to assess the fitness of
bank branches whose head office is elsewhere in the EU. The directive's
central aim was to improve the supervision of banks by forcing each EU
member's supervisory authority to take responsibility for verifying that
banks headquartered in its country are fit to take deposits.
Mr Alex Crighton, a director of Chieftain - which tried to raise almost
Pounds 100m through Amro and Mr Picken - said he was very disturbed by the
implications of the directive. 'Amro was operating in London and we dealt
with them as though they were a British bank', said Mr Crichton, who
submitted his evidence to the Bank last week.
Mr Levy is suing ABN Amro's London branch for negligence and breach of
contract in respect of attempts by his company, Columbus Tobacco, to raise
Dollars 4m between October 1990 and March 1991 for the exploitation of a
cigarette brand called Route 66.
The writ alleges that the bank failed to investigate adequately either the
viability of the funding scheme or the standing of Mr Picken.
Mr Levy first brought the affair to the attention of the Bank of England
more than two years ago. The Bank said yesterday that 100 hours of a senior
manager's time had been spent examining papers relating to the case.
Mr Levy says Amro ignored warnings about Mr Picken. Mr Charalambos Katsamas,
of the shipping company Internav, said yesterday he informed Amro towards
the end of 1990 that he felt the bank should not be dealing with Mr Picken.
Mr Katsamas had been trying to raise substantial finance from Mr Picken, but
became alarmed when he was asked to transfer Dollars 6m to Switzerland to
purchase securities as collateral for a loan and also to pay a Dollars
250,000 advance fee. He refused.
Amro continued to work with Mr Picken on deals for Scanfisheries, Mr Levy
and Chieftain. Even after Mr Levy made a formal complaint to Amro in April
1991 about his experiences with Mr Picken, the bank continued to work on the
Chieftain and Scanfisheries transactions.
ABN Amro yesterday refused to make any comment.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Gatt set to shelve workers' rights agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial question of whether the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade should try to draw up international rules covering worker rights is
likely to be shelved until after the Uruguay Round package of agreements is
signed next April in Marrakesh.
There is already agreement among Gatt members to draw up a work programme on
trade and the environment for approval by ministers in April. In recent
weeks President Bill Clinton and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, have also strongly backed including labour standards in
future global trade negotiations.
However, the idea is strongly opposed by many developing countries which
fear a new pretext for protectionism, and it has aroused mixed feelings in
the European Union. At a meeting yesterday of the Trade Negotiations
Committee, which oversees the Uruguay Round, senior trade officials agreed
that the Marrakesh agenda should focus on implementing the trade talks that
have just ended rather than trying to launch new ones.
Negotiators expect trade-environment discussions to be difficult enough
without adding more contentious issues. As well as worker rights,
international rules for competition policy, currency movements and
investment are all candidates for inclusion in future trade talks.
The immediate priority for the 117 nations taking part in the Uruguay Round
is to complete negotiations on tariffs and services by mid-February. By
April they will also have to agree recommendations concerning the structure
and budget of the new World Trade Organisation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese government officials yesterday welcomed a US decision to drop the
threat of trade sanctions against Japan. They hoped for a similarly positive
outcome to the bilateral trade negotiations, still deadlocked only weeks
before a US-Japan summit next month.
US pressure on Japan to make a greater effort in pushing the bilateral
framework talks forward is likely to increase when Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury secretary, stops over in Tokyo on his way back to Washington over
the weekend.
Mr Bentsen is to meet the Japanese prime minister and finance minister.
The US cancelled the sanctions, which were scheduled to go into effect
yesterday if Japan had not taken steps to open its construction market to
foreign competition. The cancellation followed Japan's adoption of a plan to
increase the openness and fairness of its construction market this week.
Japan has also agreed to monitor, with the US, progress made by foreign
construction companies in winning public works contracts. The two sides will
conduct an annual review of such data as the number and value of public
works projects which are open to competitive bidding, the number of foreign
companies which are awarded such contracts and efforts made by foreign
companies to win contracts.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said he hoped the US
move to remove the threat of sanctions 'will have a favourable effect on the
Japan-US framework talks toward the summit in February'.
However, almost no progress has been seen in the key areas of contention
between the US and Japan in their trade talks, despite the short period left
before the summit on February 11, when the leaders of the two countries are
expected to announce results on specific issues.
On the crucial issue of opening up Japan's markets to foreign cars and car
parts, Japanese bureaucrats have continued to resist US proposals for
quantitative indicators which the Japanese consider to be numerical targets.
The two sides also remain wide apart in other areas such as government
procurement and deregulation of financial markets.
The impasse has led to growing US impatience over what officials see as
Japanese intransigence in the talks.
An emergency meeting held on improving market access for foreign
semiconductor manufacturers in Japan brought no progress.
The US is unhappy that the share of foreign semiconductor companies in Japan
has been falling for three quarters despite a bilateral understanding that
there would be continued improvement.

FT  21 JAN 94 / DTI demands changes to pension scheme regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday called for several changes to
pension scheme regulation in its long-awaited report into the dealings of
mini-conglomerate Bestwood.
The company was wound up in June 1990 following the misappropriation of more
than Pounds 700,000 by its former chairman and chief executive, Mr Tony
Cole. Mr Cole also effected the removal of more than Pounds 900,000 from the
pension scheme of a Bestwood subsidiary, British Drilling and Freezing, over
several years. Most of that was eventually repaid although the scheme lost
about Pounds 300,000.
Most of the DTI's recommendations have also been suggested by a government
panel which was set up following the collapse of the Maxwell pension
schemes.
In particular, the DTI urges restrictions on the level of employer-related
investment by pension schemes. It also urges the appointment of at least one
independent trustee to the trustee boards of occupational schemes, a
recommendation rejected by the government's advisory panel.
The DTI report, which covers events from 1985 to 1989, explains how Mr Cole
and his associates were able to remove assets from the pension scheme and
use them to invest in companies in which they had a personal interest. The
removal of funds, says the report, was carried out through a
Bestwood-controlled fund management company, Atlanta Fund Managers, which
was the appointed investment manager for the pension scheme in June 1986.
In its conclusions, the DTI says that Mr Cole acted improperly 'in causing
AFM systematically to breach the restrictions laid down in relation to
investments'. He also acted improperly in causing certain investments
acquired by AFM from Glen International - the company controlled by
financier Mr Terry Ramsden - to be put through to the BDF pension scheme,
thus avoiding leaving AFM with losses. Also, he failed to see that trustees
of the pension scheme were properly informed of the investments.
Meanwhile, the two Best-wood directors who were pension scheme trustees  -
Mr Charles Wilkinson and Mr Jeremy Colson, group finance director - were
criticised 'for not ensuring that the abuse stopped'. Mr Colson 'wrongly
persuaded the trustees to lend Pounds 600,000 to Bestwood at a time when he
knew it was having difficulty in obtaining funds'.
The DTI report notes that when Bestwood acquired the 75.4 per cent of BDF
which it did not own in March 1986, the pension scheme's assets, at roughly
Pounds 5m, were more than twice its liabilities. 'The purchase price took
into account the surplus as a potential asset of Bestwood.'
However the trustees were unable to extract cash from the scheme without the
permission of the Superannuation Funds Office. They never formally sought
permission to do so.
Moreover, the DTI report explains how pension scheme assets were used to buy
shares in companies in which Best-wood directors held direct interests
although the employee trustees were never informed of these connections
between the directors.
By June 1988, the market value of the assets of the pension scheme had
fallen to Pounds 2.8m from just under Pounds 6m in June 1986.
Meanwhile, some assets disappeared from the pension scheme as loans. Some
Pounds 300,000 went as loans to stockbrokers Guy Puckle with whom Mr Cole
had an account. The loans were shown on the books of the pension scheme as
'cash on deposit'.
By June 1988 a further Pounds 359,000 of scheme assets was in unit trusts
managed by AFM. In turn, these unit trusts invested assets in other
companies connected with Mr Cole or his associates, in violation of unit
trust regulations.
In addition, of the pension scheme's holdings in quoted UK equities, the
largest portion was in shares of Bestwood itself or in the shares of other
companies in which Mr Cole or his associates had an interest.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Government plans further restrictions on legal aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is proposing to withdraw legal aid funding for cases which
can be resolved without going to court as part of its strategy to cut
legal-aid expenditure, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said yesterday.
Publishing a management statement for the Legal Aid Board, the quango which
administers the legal aid fund, the Lord Chancellor said legal aid had to be
affordable and targeted towards those with the greatest need.
Lord Mackay said that people should have access to legal services and to
legal aid, but only where recourse to the law was the best solution. And
they should pay what they can reasonably afford towards the cost of their
cases.
He also plans to introduce tighter controls on legal aid expenditure,
establishing criteria for setting priorities and targeting the available
money.
The scheme was never intended to ensure that every citizen who had a good
case would be able to go to court, he said. The cost of such a scheme would
be prohibitive.
Lord Mackay said legally aided services should continue to be provided
primarily by solicitors in private practice. But he hopes to encourage law
centres and citizens' advice bureaux to take on an increasing proportion of
the work.
In setting the levels of contributions to be paid towards cases, the
criteria used will be broadly the same as those for other means-tested
benefits.
He also plans to extend standard fees for criminal legal aid work to cover
90 per cent of all cases in crown courts and magistrates' courts and to
introduce standard fees for civil legal aid work.
The Legal Aid Board yesterday welcomed Lord Mackay's statement, but appeared
to distance itself from the suggestion that the Lord Chancellor would like
to see firms competing for legal aid work on price against agreed quality
standards.
The Law Society, which last year took the Lord Chancellor to court over the
introduction of standard fees for criminal legal aid work, condemned Lord
Mackay's proposal to push ahead with competitive tendering.

FT  21 JAN 94 / PM writes to Scott about ministerial responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has told Lord Justice Scott that ministers are responsible for
the acts of civil servants, although they are not accountable for actions of
'which the minister disapproves and has no prior knowledge'.
This view would seem to underline that in some circumstances ministers
involved in the arms-to-Iraq affair could be held responsible if their
officials failed to disseminate intelligence information or drafted
parliamentary answers that deliberately misled parliament.
The prime minister's views on ministerial responsibility are spelt out in a
letter to the judge presiding over the arms-to-Iraq inquiry. It cites a
keynote constitutional statement given to the House of Commons in 1954 by
Winston Churchill's home secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. He identified in
which circumstances ministers were constitutionally responsible to
parliament 'for the fact that something had gone wrong'.
This followed the resignation of Sir Thomas Dugdale, Churchill's minister of
agriculture, after an inquiry by a leading QC had publicly criticised the
conduct of his officials.
Although often held up as a locus classicus of ministerial responsibility,
some Whitehall historians have concluded that it was the hounding from his
backbenchers that drove the minister from office.
Mr Major's constitutional statement is broadly in line with a set of
guidance notes prepared by the inquiry.
His views are contained in a letter signed by Mr Alex Allan, his principal
private secretary.
The letter also names Mr Stephen Wall, now ambassador to Portugal, as the
civil servant who deleted a reference to a 'minor modification' in
government arms sales guidelines in a briefing note to Mr Major when he was
his private secretary.
Meanwhile it emerged last night that Lord Trefgarne, the former trade and
defence minister, has agreed to give evidence to the Scott inquiry on
condition that he can be accompanied by a lawyer, although he will not be
represented by the lawyer.
Lord Trefgarne said last night that although he had supported Lord Howe's
attack on the inquiry's procedures, he was now satisfied.
He added: 'I am confident I will be adequately protected when I give
evidence to the inquiry.' The inquiry will today take evidence in public
from Mr Nicolas Bevan, a former cabinet official at the centre of the Iraqi
supergun controversy.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Westlink buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westlink, the first London Buses subsidiary to be privatised, has been sold
to its management in a Pounds 2m deal, Charles Batchelor writes.
Pictured are Clive Hodson, managing director of London Buses and London
Transport bus privatisation director, and Jeff Chamberlain, Westlink
managing director.
Westlink is the trading name for Stanwell Buses, which operates 118 buses
from depots in Hounslow and Kingston, west London. It made Pounds 220,000
after-tax profit on sales of Pounds 5.3m last year. The sale of the other 10
London Bus companies is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
London Buses said Westlink had been sold first because it was the smallest.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Campaign against copier contracts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dissatisfied customers of Southern Business Group yesterday stepped up
pressure on the office equipment supplier by launching a support network to
campaign on their behalf.
Backed by Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, the
customers are seeking the appointment of an independent arbiter in disputes
over the terms of controversial 'cost per copy' photocopier contracts
previously used by the company. The contracts combine the costs of leasing
and service over a certain period, during which charges may be raised.
Southern Business Group, which last year sacked 12 employees following the
discovery of 'improprieties' in dealings with some customers, has agreed to
support the appointment of an ombudsman for the photocopier industry.
However, funding is uncertain.

FT  21 JAN 94 / BT in talks with union over RSI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is negotiating with the National Communications
Union to agree a compensation scheme for employees who suffer from
repetitive strain injury.
The scheme, if agreed, would include action to prevent RSI and a
compensation scheme designed to avoid the delays, costs and uncertainties
associated with legal claims.
The union was active in supporting legal actions, settled in May, which led
to out-of-court settlements for 11 BT staff.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Polly Peck inquiry man is charged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Allcock, the Inland Revenue investigator who was involved in the
inquiry into Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, was yesterday
charged with two offences of conspiring to cheat the Inland Revenue, John
Mason writes.
Mr Allcock is charged with conspiring with Mr Hisham Alwan, a consultant
from Knightsbridge, London, and Mr David Shamoon, a company director from
Holland Park, London, to cheat the Revenue. Mr Alwan and Mr Shamoon were
both charged with one count each of conspiring with Mr Allcock.
Mr Allcock was suspended in September 1992 following an internal inquiry by
the Revenue into matters unconnected with Polly Peck. He was arrested in
July last year.
